N.; Bottomley, A.; Robinson, A.; Harry, E.; van Oijen, A. M.; Su, Q. P.; Jin, D.", "abstract": "The killing mechanism of many antibiotics involves the induction of DNA damage, either directly or indirectly, which activates the SOS response. RecA, the master regulator of the SOS response, has shown to play a central role in the evolution of resistance to fluoroquinolones, even after short-term exposure. While this paradigm is well established for DNA-damaging antibiotics, it remains unclear whether {beta}-lactams elicit similar resistance dynamics or depend on RecA and SOS-mediated mechanisms. In this study, we observed a rapid and stable evolution of {beta}-lactam resistance (20-fold MIC increase within 8 hours) in Escherichia coli lacking RecA after a single exposure to ampicillin. Contrary to expectation, this resistance emerged through an SOS-independent mechanism involving two distinct evolutionary forces: increased mutational supply and antibiotic-driven selection. Specifically, we found that RecA deletion impaired DNA repair and downregulated base excision repair pathways, while concurrently repressing the transcription of antioxidative defence genes. This dual impairment led to excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn promoted the emergence of resistance-conferring mutations. While ampicillin treatment did not alter survival, it selectively enriched for rare mutants arising in the RecA-deficient and ROS-elevated background. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that this oxidative environment, together with compromised DNA repair capacity, increases genetic instability and creates a selective landscape favouring the expansion of resistant clones. These results highlight the repair-redox axis as a key determinant of bacterial evolvability under antimicrobial stress.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Among the many thoroughly studied aspects of pneumonia, lipid metabolism has not been sufficiently addressed. Here, we investigated lipid deposition in the post mortem lung specimens of patients who died from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonias. We used semi-thin sections and cryosections stained with Sudan III to visualize lipid droplet deposition within cells and in the extracellular space, most notably in small lung vessels. Electron microscopy analysis of the ultrathin sections was used to confirm the homogeneous structure of the droplets. Morphometric analysis revealed that the area of lipid deposition was increased in pneumonia compared to control lung tissue. Likewise, it was increased in the macroscopically inflamed vs. the macroscopically intact area of the same pneumonia lung. The lipid profiling by chromato-mass spectrometry revealed that lipid droplet accumulation in pneumonia was associated with a specific fatty acid content of the inflamed lung tissue. The gene expression analysis pointed to changes of lipid metabolism in the inflamed lung tissue compared to control lungs. Taken together, our data indicate a number of morphologic and metabolic changes associated with inflammation and common for pneumonias of different etiologies that likely contribute to pneumonia pathogenesis. Therefore, targeting lipid metabolism can be considered a new therapeutic strategy.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in Bayesian model reduction have led to innovative, biologically plausible approaches to actively infer the state of affairs of the world and perform planning with continuous signals. However, reducing the surrounding environment into a small set of simpler hypotheses remains a challenge in highly dynamic contexts. In this study, we propose an approach, based on active inference, that employs dynamic priors sampled from reduced versions of a generative model. Each dynamic prior corresponds to an alternative evolution of the world, which the agent can evaluate by accumulating continuous data. We test our approach on two everyday tasks: inferring a trajectory and grasping a moving object.

Here we propose a novel approach to non-invasively and longitudinally track cell-specific development using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with microstructural modelling. Tracking metabolite diffusion allows us to probe cell-specific developmental trajectories in the cerebellum and thalamus of healthy rat neonates from post-natal day (P) 5 to P30. Additionally, by comparing different analytical and biophysical microstructural models we can follow the differential contribution of cell bodies and neurites during development. The thalamus serves as a control region to assess the sensitivity of our method to microstructural differences between the regions. We found significant differences between cerebellar and thalamic metabolites diffusion properties. For most metabolites, the signal attenuation is stronger in the thalamus, suggesting less restricted diffusion compared to the cerebellum. There is also a trend for lower signal attenuation and lower ADCs with increasing age, suggesting increasing restriction of metabolite diffusion. This is particularly striking for taurine in the thalamus. We use biophysical modelling to interpret these differences. We report a decreased sphere fraction (or an increased neurite fraction) with age for taurine and total creatine in the cerebellum, marking dendritic growth. Surprisingly, we also report a U-shape trend for segment length (the distance between two embranchments in a dendritic tree) in the cerebellum agreeing with age-matching morphometry of openly available 3D-Purkinje reconstructions.

V.", "abstract": "Despite recent progress in multisensory research, the absence of stimulus-computable perceptual models fundamentally limits our understanding of how the brain extracts and combines task-relevant cues from the continuous flow of natural multisensory stimuli. In previous research, we demonstrated that a correlation detector initially proposed for insect motion vision can predict the temporal integration of minimalistic audiovisual signals. Here, we demonstrate how a population of such units can process natural audiovisual stimuli and accurately account for human, monkey, and rat behaviour, across simulations of 69 classic psychophysical, eye-tracking, and pharmacological experiments. Given only the raw audiovisual stimuli (i.e., real-life footage) as input, our population model could replicate observed responses with an average correlation exceeding 0.97. Despite relying on as few as 0 to 4 free parameters, our population model provides an end-to-end account of audiovisual integration in mammals-from individual pixels and audio samples to behavioural responses. Remarkably, the population response to natural audiovisual scenes generates saliency maps that predict spontaneous gaze direction, Bayesian causal inference, and a variety of previously reported multisensory illusions. This study demonstrates that the integration of audiovisual stimuli, regardless of their complexity, can be accounted for in terms of elementary joint analyses of luminance and sound level. Beyond advancing our understanding of the computational principles underlying multisensory integration in mammals, this model provides a bio-inspired, general-purpose solution for multimodal machine perception.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Re-examination of the same dataset reveals a consistent tradeoff between the liver and brain proportions of a four-organ thermogenic core (kidney, heart, liver and brain), an inherent mechanism of thermoregulation that predates the emergence of permanent homeothermy. The ability of current models of brain size evolution to account for thermal homeostasis is limited by two common assumptions: that organ sizes evolve independently, and that the energy cost of the brain is proportional to the log ratio of brain mass with respect to body mass. Instead, arithmetic ratios provide direct experimental evidence for thermoregulatory constraints on brain size, as do organ cellular metabolic rates (cMRs). These are inferred without log transformation from the parallel adaptive increases in MR/kg and number of microRNA families (mirFam) that have accompanied major shifts in mammalian evolution. The cMR of the liver, the primary organ of gluconeogenesis, varies inversely with that of the brain, the primary consumer of glucose, a phylogenetic plasticity that appears to recapitulate its unique developmental plasticity. With mirFam as a proxy for energy reliability, a positive feedback model of relative brain size detected adaptation to a low-energy regime among the smallest primates and, among the largest primates, adaptation to the physiological limit on the rate of heat dissipation.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

In this context, systemic targets like incretin hormones and their modulators - particularly DPP4 inhibitors - have gained prominence. Ayurveda, the Indian System of Medicine (ISM), with its clinically validated multicomponent formulations offers a valuable resource for integrative therapeutic strategies with systemic mode of action. Purpose: The study investigates the incretin modulatory effect of Varanadi Kashayam (VA), an Ayurveda polyherbal formulation used in the clinical management of diabetes and its comorbidities. Experimental approach: A high-fat diet induced Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model was used to study the anti-diabetic, GLP-1 secretory, and anti-obesity effects of VA. In vitro studies using GLUTag cells assessed the GLP-1 secretion and DPP4 gene expression modulation; and studies using 3T3-L1 fibroblasts examined the anti-adipogenic effects. Computational methods including molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations were used to identify the phytochemicals responsible for DPP4 inhibition. Results: VA administration significantly improved fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance in experimental animals, along with enhanced GLP-1 secretion. The in vitro results showed inhibition of DPP4 enzyme activity, increase in GLP-1 secretion and downregulation of DPP4 gene expression in GLUTag cells, and suppression of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 fibroblast cells. Computational analyses ascertained Chebulinic acid, Chebulagic acid and Terchebin as top ranked phytochemicals responsible for DPP4 inhibition effect. Conclusion: Combining in vitro, in vivo and in silico findings, this study provides valuable insight into the incretin modulatory effect of VA in treating diabetes and associated metabolic diseases.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Attunement can manifest as synchrony at the neurophysiological level, where partners exhibit similar brain responses to each other, known as interpersonal neural synchrony. However, in adult romantic relationships, the level of satisfaction that partners experience in a relationship may differ from each other, thus the extent of emotion attunement may differ according to the perceived relationship quality. Thus far, no study has examined how difference in relationship satisfaction between partners influence interpersonal neural synchrony. This exploratory study on 17 heterosexual Singaporean Chinese non-married couples investigated whether romantic partners relationship satisfaction difference influenced the extent of interpersonal neural synchrony within a couple when sharing an emotive experience. Each couple wore an fNIRS cap, to measure brain activity in their prefrontal cortex (PFC), while co-viewing seven videos intended to evoke positive, negative or neutral emotions. We found preliminary evidence that differences in self-reported relationship satisfaction between romantic partners modulated interpersonal neural synchrony in the frontal right cluster of the PFC involved in social decision-making. This finding suggested that couples in which partners reported closer matching of relationship satisfaction displayed greater interpersonal neural synchrony, possibly due to more similar social cognitive processes when viewing emotive videos together.

Compared with existing methods, MetaDICT can better avoid the overcorrection of batch effects and preserve biological variation when there exist unobserved confounding variables, data sets are highly heterogeneous across studies, or the batch is completely confounded with some covariates. Furthermore, MetaDICT can generate comparable embedding at both taxa and sample levels that can be used to unravel the hidden structure of the integrated data and improve the integrative analysis. Applications to synthetic and real microbiome data sets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of MetaDICT in integrative analysis.

In most bacteria and eukaryotes, single-headed lipids self-assemble into flexible bilayer membranes. By contrast, thermophilic archaea tend to possess bilayer lipids together with double-headed, monolayer spanning bolalipids, which are thought to enable cells to survive in harsh environments. Here, using a minimal computational model for bolalipid membranes, we explore the trade-offs at play when forming membranes. We find that flexible bolalipids form membranes that resemble bilayer membranes because they are able to assume a U-shaped conformation. Conversely, rigid bolalipids, which resemble the bolalipids with cyclic groups found in thermophilic archaea, take on a straight conformation and form membranes that are stiff and prone to pore formation when they undergo changes in shape. Strikingly, however, the inclusion of small amounts of bilayer lipids in a bolalipid membrane is enough to achieve fluid bolalipid membranes that are both stable and flexible - resolving this trade-off. Our study suggests a mechanism by which archaea can tune the material properties of their membranes as and when required to enable them to survive in harsh environments and to undergo essential membrane remodelling events like cell division.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Orchid survival, size, flowering, pollination and germination were measured post-fire relative to areas unburnt for >22 years.\n\nKey resultsThere were 58 overlapping major fires (1972-2024), averaging 8.7% of the 63-ha area annually. Correlating locations of 17 orchids with fire history revealed 5 fire-intolerant and 6 less productive species, while 6 benefited from fire-promoted flowering. Even the latter could be killed by unseasonal autumn fire. Fire decreased or increased pollination, with three orchids dependant on fire.

The hindbrain herniates through the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal leading to frequent hydrocephalus and occasional respiratory emergency. Chiari II is not confined to the back of the brain, but is a global brain syndrome with cerebral cortical and other defects implicated in learning disability, which affects 20-25% of children with open spina bifida. The reason for the association between Chiari II and spina bifida has long been debated. Separate effects on the brain and spinal cord of causative genetic or non-genetic factor(s) are possible. Conversely, Chiari II may be secondary to open spina bifida, and a prominent hypothesis cites chronic leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the open spinal lesion as causative. To resolve the issue of causation, we bred mice in which Pax3 gene function is conditionally deleted by Cdx2cre, specifically in the lower body, leaving the head genetically intact. Open spina bifida is seen in all Cdx2cre/+; Pax3fl/fl fetuses, together with many of the features of Chiari II in the wild-type brain of the mice. These include: hindbrain and cerebellar herniation, cortical thinning, callosal and hippocampal hypogenesis, heterotopic neurons in the cerebral cortex and habenula, and thickening of the ventricular zone.

M.", "abstract": "The role of mutation rate in evolutionary rescue has been extensively explored, but little work has investigated how evolutionary rescue can promote mutators, lineages with higher mutation rates. Under complete linkage, we investigate the likelihood of evolutionary rescue on a mutator background that either emerges de novo or pre-exists in the population prior to a severe environmental change. If such an evolutionary rescue event occurs, the mutator lineage sweeps into the population, and thus the environmental stress has promoted mutators. Our findings indicate that mutation rate evolution can substantially boost rescue probabilities, but stronger mutators are most effective when the wildtype has a low mutation rate, while their advantage diminishes for higher wildtype mutation rates. Interestingly, at intermediate wildtype mutation rates, emerging mutators can be almost equally likely to sweep no matter how slowly or quickly the environment changes. However, at low wildtype mutation rates, mutators are only likely to sweep for very slow environmental changes due to the sequential nature of necessary mutations for such sweeps to occur. Finally, we show that pre-existing mutators can be significantly more likely to rescue the population compared to the wildtype, provided the wildtype's mutation rate is relatively low.

Among the most frequently detected phthalates in the environment is dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Although ubiquitous in freshwater environments at concentrations in the ng/L to g/L range, studies on the effects of DBP on Daphnia magna have overlooked the potential effects of exposure at low concentrations (g/L order) and without solvent. Our work focuses on the chronic effects of DBP on life history traits (survival, growth, reproduction) in the freshwater model species, D. magna (Crustacea). Organisms were exposed to two exposure regimes: from the beginning of embryonic development or from the adult stage, at the third brood, when most of the energy investment in growth is complete. The results obtained show that the DBP exposure regime is an essential parameter in the effects on D. magna life history traits. While no significant response was observed in organisms exposed at the adult stage, disturbances to survival, growth and reproduction were observed at concentrations as low as the g/L range in organisms exposed at the beginning of embryonic development. The results also demonstrated that exposure to a concentration gradient of DBP results in different dose-dependent response typologies, depending on the life history traits measured. For survival, the dose-response relationship was non-monotonic, with greater juvenile mortality at intermediate concentrations (100, 280 and 500 g/L) than at higher concentrations (1000 and 2000 g/L). For effects on growth and reproduction, the responses followed classic monotonic dose-response relationships with low sensitivities. At the end of the experiment, the EC10-25d values were 1.01 g/L for reproduction and 79.22 g/L for growth. However, when calculated at earlier timepoints, the EC10-4d and the EC10-7d for growth were 0.25 g/L and 1.16 g/L. Furthermore, projecting these results to the population level suggests that exposure to DBP from early embryonic development leads to a decrease in growth rate and a change in population structure.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

This could indicate a neuroprotective role for GVBs, however, the mechanism of GVB formation and its functional implications are elusive. Here, we demonstrate that CK1delta activity is required for GVB formation. CK1delta is sequestered in the GVB during this process in an autophagy-dependent manner. We show that neurons with GVBs (GVB+) are resilient to tau-induced impairment of global protein synthesis and are protected against tau-mediated neurodegeneration. GVB+ neurons do not exhibit differential activation of proteostatic stress responses, but have increased ribosomal content. Importantly, unlike neurons without GVBs, GVB+ neurons fully retain the capacity to induce long-term potentiation-induced protein synthesis in the presence of tau pathology. Our results have identified CK1delta as a key regulator of GVB formation that confers a protective neuron-specific proteostatic stress response to tau pathology.

Although recent studies have explored the relationship between gut microbiota and female life history, the link between gut microbiota and male life history remains understudied. In this study, we explored the role of gut microbiota in shaping male life history traits by correlating variation in life history traits across genetically homogeneous isolines with their naturally occurring gut microbiota. Using 22 isolines from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), we measured lifespan, early/late-life reproduction, and early/late-life physiological performance. We characterized the gut microbiota composition in young (5 days old) and old (26 days old) flies using 16S rDNA sequencing. We observed significant variation in male life history traits across isolines, as well as age-related changes in gut microbiota composition. Using machine learning, we showed that gut microbiota composition could predict the age of the organisms with high accuracy. Associations between gut microbiota and life history traits were notable, particularly involving the Acetobacter genus. In early life, the abundance of Acetobacter ascendens was associated with functional aging, while Acetobacter indonesiensis was linked to reproductive senescence. In late life, higher abundances of A. ascendens and Acetobacter pasteurianus were negatively associated with lifespan. These findings highlight the potential role of gut microbiota, especially the Acetobacter genus, in male fitness and aging.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

The experiment was conducted for 537 days at a temperature of 30-32; and a pH of 8.0-9.0. The transformation from nitrite-anammox to nitrate-anammox was stably achieved on the 350th day. The experimental results showed that, nitrate directly oxidized ammonium into nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions. The produced gas consisted of 96.3% nitrogen and 3.7% carbon dioxide. The removal ratio of ammonium to nitrate was approximately 1.67:1, and the total inorganic nitrogen removal rate reached up to 290.20 mg/(L{middle dot}d). Unlike the nitrite-anammox reaction, this reaction was accompanied by an acid production process, which caused a decrease in pH. When the substrate was changed to nitrite and ammonium, the total nitrogen removal rate of only 1.1-1.3 mg/(L{middle dot}d) was achieved.

These sensory processing differences suggest the potential for using patterned auditory stimulation to modulate neural activity and mitigate symptoms. While impairments in higher cognitive functions are a hallmark of autism, they remain underexplored in rodent models compared to basic sensory-motor deficits. In this study, we investigated higher cognitive function in the valproic acid (VPA) rodent model of autism and evaluated whether auditory entrainment could ameliorate associated impairments. Pregnant dams received an intraperitoneal injection of VPA on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), and offspring were subsequently tested on a delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task to assess working memory. Following 40Hz sensory entrainment, VPA-exposed animals showed significantly impaired performance and altered trial-by-trial learning dynamics, indicating deficits in working memory-based decision making. More importantly, auditory stimulation led to increased gamma-frequency oscillations and enhanced power in other bands (theta, beta) across brain regions, as assessed by LFP recordings in freely moving animals. These neural effects were sustained even after stimulation ended, indicating robust and lasting modulation of brain dynamics.\n\nThis provides strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of sensory entrainment in reversing autism-related cognitive deficits.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Therefore, Australia developed a national response mechanism to respond to detections of exotic pests. This mechanism includes early detection surveillance and identification services. Tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard is a serious pest of solanaceous plants (including tomato, potato and eggplant) in many parts of the world. T. evansi was first detected in Australia in August 2013 at Sydney, New South Wales. As part of a response to an exotic incursion, a delimiting survey was initiated. Other Tetranychus species exist in Australia and identification techniques were required to identify different species. Submitted survey samples were identified to species level using morphological keys and molecular sequence analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. Surveillance results of Solanaceae host plants at the time determined it was not technically feasible to eradicate this emergency plant pest (EPP). Additional to blackberry nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.), tomato, potato and sweetcorn, T. evansi was found damaging native kangaroo apple, Solanum aviculare G. Forst., (a new host plant record) and naturalised capeweed, Arctotheca calendula (L.) Levyns (Asteraceae). COI sequence analyses confirmed the morphological identifications of three different Tetranychus species (including T. lambi Pritchard & Baker and T. ludeni Zacher) among samples and further identified all twelve T. evansi specimens to a single mitochondrial haplotype (clade1; H4) previously reported from climatically diverse locations in Africa, East Asia and the Mediterranean region. Currently, T. evansi is considered to be an established plant pest in NSW, so far extensively recorded in the Sydney Basin. Based on the lack of COI sequence variation diversity among the Australian specimens of T. evansi, we suggest that this species was likely introduced from a single genetically depauperate source population. This genetic lineage of T. evansi established now in Australia was previously reported as invasive in semi-arid and cold regions outside of the species preferred distribution, and laboratory trials have indicated its propensity for increased tolerance of cold climate habitats. This has implications concerning potential for further spread of this lineage of T. evansi to a broader range of habitats and plant hosts in Australia.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Although RVF has been reported in The Gambia, its epidemiology remains poorly understood. This study developed a compartmental model to study RVF dynamics in the cattle population of the country. The model incorporated seasonally dynamic transmission parameters reflecting transhumant movement and ecological differences between two distinct ecoclimatic regions: the Sahelian area and the Gambia river. Parameterised using serological data linked to household survey data, the model predicted endemic RVF virus (RVFV) circulation within The Gambia, and captured temporal infection trends that closely match empirical data. Weak decay rates of seropositivity were required to match predicted and observed age-seroprevalence. Results indicated sustained RVFV transmission during the dry season in the Gambia river eco-region, with a high risk of seasonal virus introductions to the Sahelian eco-region at the start of the wet season via the returning transhumant cattle. A hypothetical transhumant movement ban reduced the frequency of outbreaks in the Sahelian eco-region but disproportionately increased their magnitude, with no long-term reduction in the number of infectious cattle. Our study highlighted the role of livestock mobility in RVFV epidemiology in The Gambia and the need for targeted control strategies that do not involve bans on transhumance movements.

A subject-specific 3D maxillary model was developed from CBCT imaging, incorporating cortical and trabecular bone, periodontal ligament (PDL), teeth, attachments, and aligner geometry. Five attachment shapes square, rectangle, trapezoid, ellipse, and semicircle were analyzed in single and dual (buccal-lingual) configurations across four clinically relevant movements: mesialization, intrusion, extrusion, and rotation. Finite-element simulation results indicated that flat-shaped attachments (rectangular and trapezoidal) generated the greatest crown displacement but induced higher PDL strain (up to 0.390 mm/mm) and localized bone stress (7.11 MPa), particularly at the root apex and alveolar crest. Curved attachments provided more diffused load distribution but significantly reduced movement efficiency. Dual attachments improved root engagement and bodily displacement in all movement types, mitigating undesired tipping and enhancing force symmetry, albeit with elevated strain. Rotational control was most influenced by attachment geometry, with flat designs producing greater angular movement. Overall, attachment shape and placement exert a substantial influence on orthodontic biomechanics during aligner therapy. The findings underscore the need for evidence-based attachment protocols tailored to specific movement goals and patient risk profiles. These insights can guide clinicians toward optimizing clear aligner treatments for improved movement precision, minimized biological risk, and enhanced treatment outcomes in complex orthodontic cases.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Despite advances in imputation, most existing methods fail to address structured missingness, where data are missing according a deterministic pattern and which arise due to systematic patterns introduced by experimental design, site protocols, or cohort differences. These patterns violate key assumptions of most imputation algorithms, yet their impact is rarely evaluated. We demonstrate that structured missingness is a fundamental challenge to drawing valid inferences from standard imputation techniques. First, we present a comprehensive framework for understanding and accommodating the effects of structured missingness. Next, we show through simulations and real-world psychometric data with structured missingness, that widely used algorithms optimised for numerical precision (e.g., Extra Trees, AutoComplete) underperform due to site effects, while donor-based methods (e.g., MICE, hierarchical MICE) better preserve multivariate structure. We propose a novel hierarchical approach that provides optimal performance in simulated and experimental data. Finally, we show that commonly used accuracy metrics, such as mean squared error can obscure these failures, and are therefore inadequate for the evaluation of structured missingness. In contrast, other divergence-based metrics offer a more sensitive and interpretable alternative. We apply this approach to harmonising psychometric data across cohorts, which provides excellent item-level alignment across different instruments. Our study highlights the need for a paradigm shift in handling missing data within biomedical research, moving beyond conventional imputation frameworks to develop tools that can account for structured missingness.

S.", "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster females, as in most organisms, the segregation of meiotic chromosomes depends on the proper distribution of crossovers along paired maternal and paternal chromosomes. In most cases, crossovers require the synaptonemal complex (SC), a conserved multi-protein structure that forms between homologous chromosomes in meiotic prophase I. Recent studies leveraging hypomorphic alleles suggest that the SC plays a more direct role in the distribution of crossover events. However, identifying additional hypomorphic mutations that avoid catastrophic phenotypes by partially disrupting the SC has been challenging. Here, to create a new hypomorphic allele of the D. melanogaster SC gene corolla, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to replace it with the coding sequence of its Drosophila mauritiana ortholog, yielding corollamau. Since the amino acid sequence of SC proteins is rapidly diverging while maintaining the general tripartite structure of the SC, we hypothesized that this replacement would enable the assembly of the SC but show defects in crossover distribution. Indeed, at 25 {degrees}C corollamau homozygous females exhibited full-length SC with defects in SC maintenance and crossover formation, resulting in moderate levels of chromosome missegregation. At 18 {degrees}C, SC maintenance was rescued, and recombination rates were improved, although they remained significantly lower than observed in wild type. Importantly, these phenotypes are less severe than observed in corolla null mutant flies, suggesting corollamau is a hypomorphic allele. Unexpectedly, in homozygotes we also observed unique polycomplexes composed of the SC proteins Corolla and Corona but lacking the transverse filament protein C(3)G. Overall, we report a novel hypomorphic allele of corolla that will enable future studies on the role of the SC in crossover distribution.

Research so far has largely focused on the self-organized spatial patterns of plant communities in drylands. It, however, remains unclear whether and how biocrusts having distinct morphology and life history from plant communities could self-organize themselves and form unique spatial patterns. Here we conducted field observations of biocrusts across successional stages and employed a probabilistic Cellular Automaton (CA) model to investigate the distinct self-organized spatial patterns exhibited by mosaic patches of mosses and lichens with different patch size distributions (PSDs). Our study demonstrates that short-range positive feedbacks initially promote the development of patches, featured with a heavy-tailed PSD, while long-range negative feedbacks subsequently curtail further expansion of big patches, thereby establishing a characteristic patch scale with regular PSDs. Strikingly, only lichens reverted back to the heavy-tailed PSD in the late succession stage, presumably implying self-organized critical fragmentation of lichen patches. Field measurements of biocrust performance at the center and edge of patches of varying sizes along succession stages further support the classic scale-dependent feedback mechanism for Turing pattern formation.

P.; Mahata, S. K.; Sahoo, D.", "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder defined by amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), yet approximately 30% of aged individuals exhibit these hallmark lesions without developing cognitive impairment, a clinically silent condition termed asymptomatic AD (AsymAD). The molecular basis of this cognitive resilience remains poorly understood due to a lack of mechanistic models. Here, we integrate systems level Boolean network modeling with in vivo validation to define the transcriptomic logic of AsymAD and uncover a novel preclinical model. Using Boolean implication networks trained on large-scale human cortical RNA seq datasets, we identified a robust and invariant AD gene signature that accurately stratifies disease states across independent datasets. Application of this signature to Chromogranin A deficient PS19 mice (CgA-KO/PS19) revealed a unique resilience phenotype: male mice developed AD like molecular and neuropathological profiles in the pre-frontal cortex yet retained intact learning and memory. Female CgA-KO/PS19 mice displayed even greater protection, including reduced Tau phosphorylation and preserved synaptic ultrastructure. These findings establish the first validated murine model of AsymAD and identify CgA as a modifiable node linking neuroendocrine signaling, Tauopathy, and cognitive preservation. This work provides a scalable platform to probe sex-specific resilience, uncover early-stage biomarkers, and accelerate preventive therapeutic development in AD.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Several demethylases responsible for 6mA removal have been identified in multicellular eukaryotes. However, despite the much higher abundance of 6mA in unicellular species, no such enzymes have been reported and the biological significance of 6mA removal in these organisms remain unclear. Here, we identify and functionally characterize DMT3 as a dedicated 6mA demethylase in unicellular eukaryotes. DMT3 targets both fully and hemi-methylated ApT dinucleotides on DNA. It is predominantly localized at transcription start sites (TSS), where it antagonizes the activity of the 6mA methyltransferase AMT1. Deletion or catalytic inactivation of DMT3 leads to genome-wide ectopic 6mA deposition specifically at TSS regions, driven by AMT1, and is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility and elevated enrichment of transcription-associated histone marks. These epigenetic alterations disrupt gene expression, reduce osmotic stress resistance, and impair the initiation of sexual reproduction. Together, our findings uncover a critical 6mA demethylase in unicellular eukaryotes, and highlight the essential role of active 6mA removal in maintaining transcriptional and developmental integrity.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

The order Nidovirales includes diverse viruses, such as coronaviruses, which are well known for their zoonotic potential. Toroviruses are a less-studied genus within Nidovirales primarily associated with gastrointestinal diseases in ungulates, although some evidence suggests their presence in humans. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel torovirus from a fecal sample of a dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) in Spain, which we named Dormouse torovirus (DToV). This represents the first complete genome of a rodent-associated torovirus. The 28,555-nucleotide genome encodes the six characteristic torovirus open reading frames, but these exhibit low amino acid sequence identity (44.3-86.3%) compared to other toroviruses, indicating that DToV likely represents a new viral species. Bayesian analysis of the ORF1b suggests that DToV diverged from known toroviruses approximately 1300 years ago. Moreover, the basal phylogenetic position of DToV suggests that rodents may represent a reservoir for this viral genus. Our findings expand the known torovirus host range, underscore their potential for cross-species transmission, and highlight the importance of continued surveillance of wildlife viruses.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

R.; Hatsukami, T.; Sui, B.", "abstract": "Background: The clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular disease are known to differ between the Chinese and United States (U.S.) populations as do the plaque features on imaging. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the histological features of excised carotid plaques from Chinese and U.S. patients. Methods: Carotid endarterectomy specimens collected from two prospective studies were included. The entire plaque was serially sectioned (10 {micro}m thickness) at 0.5-1 mm intervals. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Mallory's trichrome staining were performed. The morphology and components of the plaques were measured and compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 1,152 histological sections from 75 Chinese patients and 1,843 sections from 111 U.S. patients were analyzed. The Chinese group had significantly smaller minimum lumen diameters (median: 1.1 vs. 1.3 mm, p=0.046) and a larger percent wall volume (median: 74% vs. 70%, p=0.018) than the U.S. group. After adjusting for confounding factors, carotid plaques in the Chinese population were more likely to have more lipid pools (&]beta]=10.0%, 95%CI: 4.9 to 15.9%), more recent intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH; &]beta]=8.4%, 95%CI: 4.5 to 12.7%), and less late IPH (&]beta]=-8.2%, 95%CI: -11.3 to -5.4), and fewer fibrous cap disruptions (45% vs. 67%, p=0.061). Chinese plaques were more homogeneous and had a higher percentage of plaques with features of xanthomas than did U.S. plaques (20% vs 2.7%, p<0.001). Conclusions: The histology of Chinese plaques differs significantly from that of U.S. plaques, suggesting substantial differences in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease between Chinese and North American populations, which could enhance the gap in racial pathology comparison, indicating a need for a different management approach.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

SCTr enabled a detailed analysis of adaptive stress response pathways (SRPs), including the unfolded protein response (UPR), oxidative stress response (OSR), heat shock response (HSR), and DNA damage response (DDR). Troglitazone upregulated lipid metabolism genes (PLIN2, ACOX1) along with HSR and UPR activation, with co-expression of DNAJA1, HSP90AA1, and DDIT3 in subsets of cells. Brefeldin A and tunicamycin strongly induced UPR markers (HSPA5, SYVN1, LMF2, PDIA4) in subsets of cells, with some also expressing apoptotic (DDIT3, CASP8) and autophagic (SQSTM1) genes, indicating diverse stress responses. Rotenone activated GDF15, TRIB3, and DDIT3 in a fraction of cells, accompanied by PLIN2 and mild UPR induction, reflecting heterogeneous mitochondrial stress responses. We scored individual cells using literature-derived SRP gene signatures to characterize overall stress phenotypes and clustered them using a generalized Jaccard metric. The clustering revealed five phenotypic groups spanning cell states associated with homeostasis, adaptive responses, terminal outcomes, autophagy, and apoptosis. By systematically analyzing the distributions of cells in different states across treatments, we visualized dynamic shifts in cellular subpopulations responding to chemicals, revealing early stress responses and potential transitions to cell death. Our findings suggest the utility of SCTr in decoding stress states that could provide possible insights into transitions between cellular adaptive and terminal transitions involved in toxicity.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

The treatment by ARCs showed sustained efficacy, low immunogenicity, and minimal off-target effects in animal model, which are key concerns in clinical translation of gene therapies.

Our approach, HAVEN, is the first to apply to multiple hosts and to generalize to unseen hosts and viruses. HAVEN is a transformer-based architecture coupled with hierarchical self-attention that can accept sequences of highly diverse lengths. We integrate HAVEN with a prototype-based few-shot learning classifier to predict rare classes. We demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and generalizability of HAVEN through a comprehensive series of experiments. In particular, we show that HAVEN can achieve a median AUPRC of 0.67 while predicting common hosts. Moreover, HAVEN retains this AUPRC value even for rare hosts (median prevalence as low as 0.09%).

High agreement was observed among individuals self-identifying as White (concordance rate=98.8%), Black (97.2%), East Asian (96.1%), and South Asian (89.9%), while substantial discordance was found in those self-identifying as Hispanic (concordance rate=74.6%), Middle Eastern / Central Asian (67.9%) or Indigenous (40.7%). We quantified agreement using Cohens kappa ({kappa} = -0.01 unweighted; 0.35 weighted) and assessed admixture complexity with Shannon entropy, revealing a strong relationship between discordance and ancestry heterogeneity. Principal component analysis further revealed that tightly clustered genetic profiles often corresponded with lower admixture complexity, whereas broader, overlapping distributions were observed in groups with more heterogeneous ancestry and complex sociocultural histories. These findings underscore the complex interplay between sociocultural identity and genomic data, with discordance patterns reflecting the historical and cultural complexity of human populations. By quantifying this relationship systematically with ntRoot, our approach provides a framework for moving rigid categorical labels toward more nuanced genome-derived ancestry characterization that can improve both scientific rigor and representational equity in genomics.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Copers do not experience ankle instability and continue their daily activities. However, it is unclear whether copers can use movement strategies similar to people without an ankle sprain. Identifying movement strategies can improve efficacy and prevent unwanted effects during training. Therefore, we aimed to compare the kinematics and muscular activities of the lower limbs during half squats and gait between copers and healthy controls. Ten copers (7 men, 3 women; age = 21.6 {+/-} 1.1 years) and 10 controls (6 men, 4 women; age = 22.5 {+/-} 2.8 years) were included in the cross-sectional study. We compared angles of the thigh, shank, and foot calculated from inertial measurement units and muscle activities of the biceps femoris long head, rectus femoris, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior between copers and controls during half squats and gait.  For half squats, copers demonstrated thigh restriction with an effect size of 0.67-1.35, whereas we observed no significant differences in the shank and foot angles in the descending phase. Copers demonstrated less activity with an effect size of 0.61-1.58 in all four muscles. Copers showed lower activities of the rectus femoris and tibialis anterior during the same period of thigh restriction. For gait, there were no significant differences in lower limb angles and muscle activities between copers and controls. Copers may restrict thigh rotation unintentionally, leading to less muscle activity during half squats. Removing unconscious restrictions using sensor-based quantitative feedback can enable copers to obtain more efficient training. Our results suggest that assessing the limb movements of copers is important for efficient training, even if they do not experience instability so they can continue with their daily activities.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

In APPswe cells, we found depletion of LD associated with an accumulation of free fatty acids that can be related with the observed LD degradation by chaperone-mediated autophagy. In these cells we also found decreased levels of seipin, which might contribute to triacylglycerol accumulation. These lipid alterations are associated with increased levels of ROS and lipid peroxidation in APPswe cells. The pharmacological modulation of DGAT1, that mediates triacylglycerol synthesis, normalized LD size and improved ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial function in APPswe cells.

Furthermore, most studies focus only on connectivity, ignoring node heterogeneity, even though real brain regions have different structural and dynamical properties. Here we present an improved approach to fitting Ising models to 360-region functional MRI data: derivation of an initial guess model from group data, optimization of simulation temperature, and two stages of Boltzmann learning, first with group data, then with individual data. We then analyze how data binarization threshold affects goodness-of-fit, the role of the external field in model behavior, and correlations between model parameters and features from structural MRI, including myelination and sulcus depth. The fitted models can reproduce the functional connectivity of the data across a wide range of thresholds, but the role of the external field parameters in model behavior increases with threshold. In parallel, the coupling between nodes correlates with structural connectivity throughout this range, but correlations between the external field and structural features increase with threshold. These results show how our methodology enables personalized, biophysically interpretable modeling of structure-function relationships at the whole-brain level, which can aid understanding of individual differences in brain network organization and dynamics.

Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) play a role in memory consolidation and are impaired in various AD mouse models. However, it remains unclear how experience affects SWRs and how extrinsic signals contribute to SWR generation in AD. Here, by combining behavioral, in vivo electrophysiological and fiber photometry approaches, we show that an experience-dependent increase in hippocampal SWRs is disrupted in male and female 5xFAD mice. In wild-type mice, SWRs during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) increased after exploring a novel environment and the SWR rate gradually decreased with NREMS episodes and multiple behavioral sessions. However, 5xFAD mice did not show such experience-dependent SWR rate changes. A similar deficit was observed after a novel object recognition test. On the other hand, sleep spindles were intact in 5xFAD mice under all conditions. Since deficits in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons have been implicated in 5xFAD mice and SWRs are regulated by hippocampal cholinergic tone, we examined if hippocampal cholinergic signals could explain experience-dependent SWR deficits. Using fiber photometry and expressing a genetically encoded acetylcholine (ACh) sensor in the hippocampus, we found that ACh dynamics in the hippocampus were intact in 5xFAD mice across sleep-wake cycles, including NREMS, while we also found a negative correlation of infraslow cortical signal power dynamics with hippocampal ACh signals during NREMS regardless of genotypes.

Little is thus known about A. baumannii isolates from healthy individuals from the community. This study analysed genome sequences from nine A. baumannii isolates obtained from the upper respiratory tract of healthy individuals of the indigenous Orang Asli community in their rural settlements located in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Genomic analysis revealed all nine A. baumannii isolates to be genetically distinct and included three new sequence types (STs) under the Pasteur scheme and six novel STs under the Oxford scheme. Notably, one isolate, A. baumannii 19064, belonged to Global Clone 8 (GC8), a lineage associated with clinical infections. Core genome phylogeny indicated that the Orang Asli community isolates were interleaved with several non-GC clinical isolates from the tertiary hospital within the same state. This is suggestive of the potential of these community isolates to cause infections under conducive conditions. This is also attested by the identification of several virulence factors in their genomes. All nine isolates carried various intrinsic blaOXA-51-like class D {beta}-lactamase genes and class C Acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinase (ADC) blaADC genes but remained susceptible to meropenem. Two isolates, A. baumannii 19053 and 19062, were tetracycline resistant but minocycline susceptible and harboured the tet(39)-tetR gene pair within mobile pdif modules located on distinct Rep_3 family plasmids. Only one isolate, A. baumannii 19055, is plasmid-free; the rest mainly harboured cryptic Rep_3-type plasmids, often containing identifiable pdif modules. These findings highlight the clinical relevance of A. baumannii strains residing in healthy individuals, particularly in isolated communities that are seldom accessible to public health. Despite their remote location, the Orang Asli A. baumannii isolates possess virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes similar to those found in hospital settings.

Production water was more homogeneous, less diverse, harboured taxa associated with conditions non-native to the reservoir (e.g., seawater), and exhibited evidence of contact with atmospheric oxygen, most likely from passing through the water separators. Conversely, crude oil samples harboured microbial taxa typically associated with oil reservoirs. Despite long-term production and, in some cases, re-injection of production waters, the putative native microbial communities were still present in the oil.

The internalized HBV virions are transported to the cytoplasmic side of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) within the SCARF2-containing endosomes. HBV capsid release from the endosomal vesicles is significantly impaired by knockdown of SCARF2. These results suggest a model that SCARF2 conveys HBV to the periphery of NPCs and ultimately leads to viral capsid release for nuclear entry.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

However, most virus-focused CRISPR screens utilize selection strategies that limit the ability to identify genes important for infection. Here, we developed a novel CRISPR screening pipeline to identify cellular determinants of Human Cytomegalovirus infection based on virally induced remodeling of cellular antibody affinity (VIRCAA), which is scalable for large libraries and can identify cellular genes that impact HCMV infection at different life cycle stages. We utilized this pipeline to interrogate proteomic and transcriptomic data sets associated with the HCMV UL26 protein, which blocks anti-viral signaling during infection. We find that JUNB drives anti-viral gene expression, induces protein ISGylation, and suppresses diverse viral infections. Further, UL26 proximally interacts with JUNB and suppresses JUNBs nuclear condensation and JUNB-mediated contraction of viral DNA replication compartments. These results highlight the VIRCAA pipelines utility for identifying important determinants of viral infection.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) co-infection in tissues may favour reciprocal replication, infection and reservoir expansion. Yet, confirmation in diseased tissues is scant. In a prospective study of 25 adults (13 (52%) PLWH on antiretroviral treatment (ART)) undergoing spinal biopsy investigation for STB, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to detect and quantify Mtb complex (MTBC) DNA (rpoB and IS6110) in 93 biopsy segments, and HIV-1 DNA (pol and gag) in 41 segments from PLWH. Mtb ddPCR sensitivity was validated against Xpert-Ultra and culture. Pathogen DNA abundance, co-detection, human cellularity, HIV status, and peripheral viral load (VL) relationships were evaluated. ddPCR detected MTBC DNA in 19/25 (76%) patients (range: 8-59,144 rpoB copies/biopsy), with increased detection in those with confirmed STB and TB history. MTBC rpoB copies/million cells were higher in biopsies from PLWH (p=0.0096) and positively correlated with matched biopsy segment HIV-1 pol copies/million cells (r=0.40; p=0.0003), not peripheral VL. HIV-1 DNA was detected in all biopsies from PLWH, four with undetectable VL. HIV-1 pol copies/million cells were higher in biopsy segments with MTBC DNA co-detected (p=0.011) and strongly correlated with VL (r=0.91; p=0.0003). ddPCR has high sensitivity for Mtb and HIV-1 DNA quantification in STB biopsies. Mtb tissue abundance correlated with localised but not systemic HIV-1 abundance.

It is mediated by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and DNMT3B, in cooperation with catalytically inactive DNMT3L. Abnormal DNA methylation contributes to genomic instability and oncogenesis, yet the mechanisms governing its establishment and regulation remain unclear. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the nucleosome-bound full-length DNMT3A2-3L and its oligomeric assemblies in the nucleosome-free state. Strikingly, DNMT3L C-terminal ''Switching Helix'' displayed a distinct conformation with a 180{degrees} rotational difference compared to its DNMT3B3 counterpart in the presence of nucleosome, preventing direct interactions with the nucleosome acidic patch. Instead, DNMT3L ADD domain promotes nucleosome binding, while DNMT3A PWWP domain inhibits it, indicating multi-layer regulation. Additionally, the novel oligomeric arrangement of DNMT3A2-3L in nucleosome-free states highlights its dynamic assembly and potential allosteric regulation. Furthermore, we identified the critical role of DNMT3L as a sensor of histone modifications, guiding the complex's chromatin interaction. These findings uncover a previously unknown mechanism by which DNMT3A-3L mediates de novo DNA methylation on chromatin through complex reorganization, histone tail sensing, dynamic DNA search, and nucleosome engagement, providing key insights into epigenetic regulation.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

In this study, we demonstrate that Caenorhabditis elegans male spermatogenesis has less robust mechanisms than hermaphrodite oogenesis for ensuring and limiting the conversion of double strand breaks into crossovers. This is not a consequence of differences in meiotic prophase timing, sex chromosome genotype, or the presence or absence of germline apoptosis. Using the cyclin-like crossover marker COSA-1, we show that males have a linear response in converting increasing numbers of double strand breaks into crossovers, suggesting weakened crossover homeostasis. While the topoisomerase SPO-11, responsible for initiating meiotic double strand breaks, has an extended period of activity in males as in hermaphrodites, we discovered that COSA-1 foci form at the very end of meiotic prophase in the absence of SPO-11 during spermatogenesis. These COSA-1-marked sites are also independent of homologous recombination, and Topoisomerases I and II. We find that the synaptonemal complex, which holds homologs in proximity, differently modulates COSA-1 enrichment to chromosomes in the absence of SPO-11 in males and hermaphrodites. Together, these findings suggest that males have less robust crossover control and that there are previously unrecognized lesions or structures at the end of meiotic prophase in spermatocytes that can accumulate CO markers.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

We combined TurboID-based proximity proteomics with a secondary BRET screen to identify eight novel K-Ras G-domain interactors. We focused on APLP2 and SPRY2 for further characterisation. APLP2 binds K-Ras indirectly via C-Raf, while SPRY2 exhibits properties of a novel effector. Co-immunoprecipitation and BRET assays revealed that the SPRY2 C-terminal fragment (residues 161-315) binds oncogenic RasG12V more strongly than the full-length protein. Both forms localise to the plasma membrane, but this localisation and binding to K-Ras is disrupted by inhibitors of K-Ras membrane anchorage or activity. Mutations at the predicted interface of K-Ras and SPRY2's C-terminal region affect the interaction. Both full-length SPRY2 and its C-terminal fragment promote differentiation of C2C12 muscle cells, a process requiring MAPK pathway inhibition. Finally, SPRY2 also forms homo- or hetero-oligomers with SPRY4.

We find that bulky N6-modified adenosines (i.e. i6A) exhibit high levels of cytotoxicity and RNA misincorporation, whereas cells dramatically restrict the misincorporation of small N6-modified adenosines (i.e. m6A), partly through sanitization by enzymatic deamination.

To facilitate such control, we designed and characterized a genetic circuit that enables stable transcriptional activation of macrophages after a brief thermal stimulus, resulting in the expression of reporters or secretion of the cytokine IL-12.

Recent computational methods have aimed to more accurately model GRNs by estimating the hidden Transcription Factor Activity (TFA), from prior knowledge of TF target regulatory connections, encoded as an input directed graph, to relax the assumption that mRNA level of the regulator correlates with the protein activity of the regulator. However, the noise in the prior knowledge can adversely affect the estimated TFA levels and the quality of the downstream inferred GRNs. Here, we present a new approach, MERLIN+P+TFA, that uses prior knowledge-guided sparsity regularization to robustly and accurately estimate TFA and downstream GRNs. We apply our method to simulated and real expression data in yeast and mammalian systems and show improved quality of inferred GRNs for both bulk and single-cell datasets. Regularized TFA offers benefits to a variety of other GRN inference algorithms, including those that have traditionally be used with expression alone, in both bulk and scRNA-seq settings. We used the inferred GRN to prioritize key regulators for the mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (mESC) state and validate 58 regulators experimentally. We identify both known and novel regulators of the mESC state and further validate the targets of 4 known and novel regulators.

These changes were accompanied by a blunted homeostatic response to SD. We further show that SD and ketamine, both rapid-acting antidepressants, exert opposing effects on mPFC circadian gene expression: SD enhances the expression of negative clock loop genes (e.g., Per, Cry), mirroring stress effects, while ketamine downregulates these same genes. Targeted deletion of the core clock gene Bmal1 in CaMK2a-expressing excitatory neurons of the mPFC disrupted sleep-wake architecture, elevated slow-wave activity, and abolished the behavioral and molecular (Homer1a) response to SD.

Here we investigate the critical functions of chromatin regulator MORC2 in epigenome reprogramming of the repetitive genome in early human neurodevelopment. We find that reversible ATP-dependent dimerization is required for MORC2 accumulation over L1s but not gene promoters. Mutation of the MORC2 ATPase module, causative for neurodevelopmental disorders, severely disrupts the distribution of MORC2 chromatin binding, leading to simultaneous loss of L1 transcriptional control and hyper-repression of clustered ZNF genes in human pluripotent stem cells. Upon neural differentiation these phenotypes persist due to striking, targeted defects in CpG methylation patterning. Together our results define the vital role of MORC2 in safeguarding the somatic human genome upon exit of pluripotency by directing CpG methylation patterning over transcriptionally-active retrotransposons in a manner analogous to the piRNA pathway in the germline.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Prior studies have observed a potential correlation between copper (Cu) and S-AKI, though the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aims to investigate the underlying mechanism between Cu and renal dysfunction under sepsis conditions. Utilizing a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) murine model, we observed a substantial upregulation of inflammatory factors and deteriorated renal function (p<0.05), concomitant with an augmented mortality rate (p<0..05). Concurrently, the renal tissue exhibited a series of pathological manifestations, including fibrosis and cell death. Concurrently, the expression of the cuproptosis-regulating protein FDX-1 (p<0.05) was found to be elevated in CLP mice. Collectively, these data indicated the activation of cuproptosis in CLP-induced S-AKI. Intriguingly, the application of abscisic acid (ABA), a FDX-1 inhibitor, led to a substantial alleviation of mortality rate and inflammatory factor level (p<0.05). Furthermore, a significant alleviation was observed in renal pathology and biofunction (p<0.05). Collectively, these observations suggest that ABA exerts a protective effect on renal function during cuproptosis promoted S-AKI. Consequently, it can be concluded that ABA has the potential to reverse cuproptosis in S-AKI by inhibiting FDX-1.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

In this study we use live-cell and single-molecule imaging approaches to investigate SMCHD1 interactions with chromatin and its function in epigenetic silencing. We show that chromatin binding of SMCHD1 genome-wide, including on the Xi, is critically dependent on the protein LRIF1 that mediates interaction with H3K9me2/3 modified nucleosomes. Using engineered mutations in the GHKL ATPase domain we show that ATP hydrolysis is required for selective enrichment of SMCHD1 at specific chromatin regions, which is critical for gene silencing on the Xi.

This effect is independent of hyperactivity or sleep loss, as walking speed was unchanged, and artificial sleep deprivation via light or mechanical stimulation did not elicit similar deficits. Notably, daytime caffeine feeding did not impair inhibitory control, highlighting a circadian gating of caffeines behavioral impact. Mechanistically, we identify dopamine signaling as a key mediator of caffeine-induced impulsivity. Reduced dopamine synthesis (pale/+), silencing of PAM dopaminergic neurons, or altered dopamine transporter activity (fumin/+) attenuated or exacerbated caffeine-induced impulsivity. Targeted manipulations identified the dopamine D1 receptor (dDA1/Dop1R1) in the mushroom body (MB) alpha/beta and gamma lobes as essential for this effect, with gamma-lobe neurons exhibiting heightened sensitivity.

While GPR25 orthologs are found across fishes to mammals, CXCL17 orthologs appear to be mammalian-specific, leaving the endogenous ligand for non-mammalian GPR25 orthologs unknown. This study unexpectedly found that human CXCL17 exhibits high activity towards GPR25 orthologs from the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae). Recombinant human CXCL17 efficiently activated both fish GPR25 orthologs in a NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT)-based {beta}-arrestin recruitment assay, and induced chemotactic movement in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells expressing fish GPR25. A human CXCL17 mutant lacking three C-terminal residues showed no such effect. A NanoBiT-based binding assay revealed that a SmBiT-tagged human CXCL17 C-terminal fragment specifically bound to secretory large NanoLuc fragment (sLgBiT)-fused fish GPR25 orthologs. Fish GPR25 orthologs had significantly higher cell surface expression in transfected HEK293T cells compared to human GPR25, improving {beta}-arrestin recruitment assay data quality. Despite approximately 400 million years of divergence between humans and fishes, the high activity of human CXCL17 on fish GPR25 orthologs suggests that the CXCL17-GPR25 pair may be conserved across all vertebrates, even though non-mammalian CXCL17 orthologs remain unidentified.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

Recordings from ex vivo brain slices collected 2-4 days after Ant-134 injection in epileptic mice, detected a number of electrophysiological phenotypic changes consistent with reduced excitability. Specifically, Ant-134 reduced action potential bursts after current injection in CA1 neurons and reduced miniature excitatory post-synaptic current frequencies in CA1 neurons. Ant-134 also reduced general network excitability, including attenuating pro-excitatory CA1 responses to Schaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices from epileptic mice.

While progress has been made towards understanding the sex determination and differentiation of this species, the understanding mechanisms remain elusive. Here we show that warm temperature promotes gonadal transformation by up-regulating testicular differentiation genes such as dmrt1/sox9a in ovaries. Trpv4, a Ca2+-permeable cation channel expressed in gonads, is highly sensitive to ambient temperature and mediates warm temperature-driven sex change of ricefield eel. In female fish reared at cool temperature, injection of Trpv4 agonist into the ovaries leads to significant up-regulation of testicular differentiation genes, and in female fish exposed to warm temperature, Trpv4 antagonist administration or trpv4 siRNA knockdown inhibits temperature-induced male gene expression. pStat3 signaling is downstream of Trpv4 and transduces Trpv4-controlled calcium signaling into the sex determination cascades. Inhibition of pStat3 activity prevents the up-regulation of male genes by warm temperature treatment and ovarian injection of Trpv4 agonist, whereas activation of pStat3 is sufficient to induce the expression of male genes, even in the presence of Trpv4 antagonist. pStat3 binds and activate jmjd3/kdm6b, an activator of the male gene dmrt1. Consistently, ovarian injection of Kdm6b inhibitor blocks the up-regulation of male genes by warm temperature treatment. We propose that environmental factors such as warm temperature promote gonadal transformation of ricefield eel via the Trpv4-pStat3-Kdm6b axis.

Monitoring the evolution of insecticide resistance alleles and their spatial heterogeneity is important for malaria control programmes, and genomic surveillance has emerged as a pivotal tool for this purpose. Earlier genomics research has typically employed convenience-based sampling, and research has yet to be performed to optimise sampling regimens for malaria vector genomics. In an earlier study, we developed a spatially explicit sampling framework that considers the underlying ecology to enable sampling mosquitoes with reduced bias. We applied this framework to sample and perform whole-genome sequencing on 485 individual specimens of An. gambiae s.l mosquitoes from Obuasi, central Ghana, an area with extensive artisanal-gold mining activities. In this region, An. gambiae s.l have been documented as highly resistant to multiple insecticides, including pyrethroids used for the treatment of bed-nets. High resolution of fine-scale population structure enabled the detection of isolation-by-distance in An. coluzzii in Obuasi, whilst finding that at this scale, geographic distance, rather than the underlying habitat, drives population structure. We examine methods to estimate mosquito kinship, demonstrating that polymorphic chromosomal inversions significantly confound established analytical tools, while revealing how the mosquito's chromosome architecture generates high variance in genetic relatedness among kin. Using genome-wide selection scans and clustering, we discover the novel mutations Gste2-F120L and Cyp9K1-N225I in detoxification enzymes that are driving selective sweeps, likely in response to insecticidal pressure. We find that the frequencies of some resistance variants are associated with artisanal-gold mines, and elucidate the continued evolution of the Voltage-gated sodium channel, the target of pyrethroid insecticides.

Although scattered along the genome, multiple CRRs are brought in close spatial proximity to the genes they regulate through the formation of DNA loops. The sequence component of transcriptional regulation suggests that DNA variants in CRRs could disrupt TF-DNA interactions and gene regulatory networks through a cascading effect. To date, only a few cases of recurrent cis-regulatory variants have been described. As an alternative to variant recurrence, some methods utilize genomic annotations that indicate the functional impact (FI) of a variant and the CRRs of each gene to detect the enrichment of high-impact cis-regulatory variants (CRVs). However, the agreement across the different associations and FI scoring methods remains unexplored. This work demonstrates that gene-CRR and FI scoring methods exhibit little consensus, highlighting the impact of the choice of a specific CRR-score combination in a given analysis. In addition, we demonstrate that cancer genes exhibit a higher frequency of FI variants compared to non-cancer genes. Based on this, we developed HiFIseek, a Snakemake pipeline exploring the enrichment of FI variants in associated genomic regions using all region-score combinations and two enrichment detection methods. We apply HiFIseek to detect genes exhibiting high FI CRVs in eight cancer cohorts and a set of breast cancer risk-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the cancer cohorts, we observe a small degree of agreement across CRR-score combinations. Although HiFIseek detected known cancer-related genes with FI CRVs, most of them did not show significant changes in their expression.

To address this question, we constructed decoding models of latent semantic features from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of six participants in both unimodal (either visual or auditory) and bimodal conditions (simultaneously visual and auditory, with participants attending to a single modality at a time). In unimodal conditions, we successfully decoded the semantic contents from the brain activity. Decodable features were consistent across modalities in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding.

To explore how BTSP-like learning can be integrated into network models, we propose a generalized BTSP rule (gBTSP), which we apply to unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, in both feedforward and recurrent networks. Unsupervised gBTSP mirrors classical frameworks of competitive learning, learning place field maps (in the feed-forward case), and attractive memory networks (in the recurrent case). For supervised learning, we show that plateau events can reduce task error, enabling gBTSP to solve tasks such as trajectory matching and delayed non-match-to-sample.

Thus, an individual's role in a foraging context, specifically whether it is a successful producer, can influence its social relationships. Therefore, we examined the interplay between social learning, producing and scrounging behavior, and social relationships in four groups of wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons). We conducted an open diffusion experiment with food boxes that required animals to learn one of two techniques to open them. 27 out of 29 individuals participated in the experiment, 24 interacted with the boxes and 16 learned to open them. Initial success was better predicted by use of individual than social information, i.e., manipulating the food boxes vs. time spent watching successful individuals or scrounging. Older males were less successful than females. Scrounging occurred in about 26% of events, with on average 1.3 individuals scrounging. The technique used, age and sex of the producer did not predict scrounging frequency. Learners and males scrounged more often than non-learners and females. Among learners, less successful individuals scrounged more often and this effect was more pronounced in males. More successful individuals and those that were scrounged more often received more affiliative behavior. Thus, cognitive skills and scrounging tolerance may strengthen social relationships in this primate species.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

R.; DeGiorgio, M.; Assis, R.; Adams, R.", "abstract": "A central challenge in comparative biology is linking present-day trait variation across species with unobserved evolutionary processes that occurred in the past. In this endeavor, phylogenetic comparative methods are invaluable for fitting, comparing, and selecting evolutionary models of varying complexity and biological meaning. Traditionally, evolutionary studies have relied on conventional statistical approaches to assess model fit and identify the one that best explains variation in a given trait. Here we explore an alternative strategy by applying supervised learning to predict evolutionary models via discriminant analysis. We formally introduce Evolutionary Discriminant Analysis (EvoDA) as an addition to the biologist's toolkit, offering a suite of new methods for studying trait evolution. We evaluate the performance of EvoDA alongside conventional model selection through a series of fungal phylogeny case studies, each targeting increasingly challenging analytical tasks. These results showcase the strengths of EvoDA, with substantial improvements over conventional approaches when studying traits subject to measurement error, which likely reflect realistic conditions in empirical datasets. To complement our simulation-based benchmarking, we explore the application of EvoDA for tackling a notoriously difficult task: predicting the mode and tempo of gene expression evolution. This empirical analysis suggests that stabilizing selection acts on a majority of genes, with bursts of expression evolution in a handful of genes related to stress, cellular transportation, and transcription regulation. Collectively, our findings illustrate the promise of EvoDA for predicting trait models across a range of evolutionary and experimental contexts, establishing a new methodological framework for the next era of comparative research.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

M.; Radriarimanga, T.; Rabemananjara, N. R.; Rasolofoson, D. W.; Randimbiharinirina, R. D.; Hohenlohe, P. A.; Radespiel, U.", "abstract": "Madagascar is a megadiverse island with exceptionally high levels of endemism, which resulted mainly from allopatric speciation promoted by the island's complex physical geography and paleoclimatic cycles. Northeastern Madagascar is uniquely suited to test the relative importance of river barriers, topography and climatic conditions for lemur genetic differentiation. Based on restriction site-associated DNA sequences, we inferred phylogeny, population structure, genetic diversity and rates of gene flow in four mouse lemur (genus Microcebus) and two woolly lemur (genus Avahi) species. In addition, we employed isolation-by-resistance models to test the importance of topography, river barriers, climate and forest cover in restricting intraspecific gene flow. Our results show that significant differences in genetic diversity and connectivity can be explained by varying responses to landscape features and species-specific phylogeographic histories. Rivers present a general barrier to gene flow, and dispersal between inter-river systems is predominantly mediated through high-elevation headwater regions. While this led to high connectivity and genetic diversity in M. lehilahytsara and A. laniger, gene flow among M. jonahi populations is limited by low climatic niche suitability at higher elevations. In addition, topographic complexity promotes connectivity among Microcebus populations, potentially by buffering impacts of seasonal or historic changes in climatic conditions. Finally, the more restricted distributions of M. macarthurii, A. mooreorum and, to some extent, M. simmonsi likely resulted from refugial dynamics and sea level fluctuations which led to geographic isolation, microendemism and secondary contact zones. Our findings generated informed hypotheses regarding the colonization history of the studied species while also having important implications for their conservation.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

We use individual-level data from the All of Us Research Program to assess whether SDOH survey variables alter heritability estimates. Incorporating SDOH summaries decreases heritability significantly for 4 of 18 anthropometric and metabolic traits in individuals whose self-reported race is \"White\" (n=67,545). There are no such significant changes in individuals whose self-reported race is \"Black or African American\" (n=6,538), likely reflecting reduced statistical power. Incorporating genetic principal components consistently lowers heritability estimates in both groups, whether or not SDOH summaries are included. These findings demonstrate that survey-derived SDOH summaries can change heritability estimates and should be considered along with genetic summaries.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Blanco-Elorrieta, E.", "abstract": "Bilingualism research has long been challenged by a lack of a unified approach to quantifying language dominance and degree of multilingualism. While numerous questionnaires (e.g., LHQ, BLP, LEAP Q, and LUQ) provide valuable data on language background variables, they lack a standardized formula to compute key measures from it. We introduce two formulas that synthesize critical linguistic variables to efficiently calculate language dominance and a multilingualism score that ranges from perfect monolingualism to native-like proficiency in multiple languages. Validation across two large datasets shows our dominance measure closely aligns with more complex PCA methods while being simpler and more efficient.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "How the brain organizes semantic information is one of the most challenging and expansive questions in cognitive neuroscience. To shed light on this issue, prior studies have attempted to decode how the brain represents concepts. We instead examined how relational information is encoded, which we pursued by submitting texts to a contemporary large language model and extracting relational embeddings from the model. Using behavioral data (N = 636), we found these embeddings capture independent information about scenes and objects, along with relational information on their semantic links. Turning to fMRI data (N = 60), we leveraged these embeddings for representational similarity analysis: The occipitotemporal cortex represents concepts in isolation, whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia principally encode relational information. Relational coding within prefrontal and striatal areas also tracks how participants reason about scenes and objects. Altogether, this research maps how information progresses from concept-level to integrative forms and how this translates into behavior.", "date": "2025-06-13", "journal": ""}
