One such pattern is generated by the ability of several biofilm-forming bacteria to switch between a flagellated and a matrix producing state. Here, using Bacillus subtilis as a model system, we investigate the role of this switch during biofilm development on a solid-air interface. By comparing the matrix-flagella spatio-temporal patterns in wild-type biofilms with mixtures of flagella- and matrix-null mutants biofilms, we find that pattern formation does not require a phenotypic switch that enables individual cells to respond to the local environment, but can be explained by a completely stochastic switch coupled to a phenotype-dependent fitness landscape that selects phenotypes at the population level. Integration of experiments and physical models shows that the coexistence between flagellated and matrix-producing cells provides the population with enhanced resilience to environmental changes, by enabling cells to manipulate and harness the local morphological and transport properties within the biofilm. Our results not only reveal a new evolutionary advantage of phenotypic plasticity in biofilms, but also illustrate how the biology and ecology of these populations are intrinsically tied to their physical properties.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Mutualistic microbes often increase the susceptibility of their host to parasite infection, but the mechanism underlying this pattern remains unknown. We tested two competing hypotheses to identify the cause of this phenomenon. First, mutualist-provided resources could attract antagonists by making hosts more resource-rich. Second, mutualism establishment itself might increase host vulnerability to antagonists. To test which mechanism underlies increased parasite susceptibility, we experimentally decoupled mutualism establishment and mutualist-provided resources in the legume-rhizobia mutualism. We measured parasite load on Medicago truncatula plants infected with root-knot nematodes in a full-factorial design, in which we independently manipulated rhizobia nodulation (mutualism establishment) and nitrogen availability (mutualist-provided resources). We found little effect of mutualism establishment on susceptibility, as nodulation without nitrogen fixation did not significantly increase parasite infection. By contrast, nitrogen did increase parasite infection. However, its effect was non-linear and was not explained by nitrogen assimilation into plant tissues, indicating that this effect is not driven by parasite attraction to resource-rich hosts. Our results suggest that mutualist-provided resources are an important driver of indirect ecological costs of mutualism, although the mechanism linking mutualist-provided resources and susceptibility to infection remains unknown.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In addition, they contribute to the regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, DNA replication, and other processes. Here, we propose a novel classification of prokaryotic MTases that addresses the limitations of the previous classification scheme developed by Malone and Bujnicki. The latter classification, which grouped MTases into categories such as , {beta}, {gamma}, etc., has been in use for over 20 years. We identified six structural classes (A-F) of MTases based on the 3D topology of the catalytic domain. This was achieved by analyzing the available 3D structures and certain predicted 3D structures of MTases from the AlphaFold DB. The catalytic domains of each class of MTase exhibit homology not only in structure but also in conserved motifs. Based on this classification, we developed an algorithm for the automatic annotation of MTase genes and assignment of their structural class. Our new classification system facilitates the recovery of MTase evolution and MTase annotations in both existing and new sequence data sets. This is particularly important for understanding the complex relationships between MTases and their roles in various biological processes.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Here we showcase a novel data-driven approach, Causal Feature Learning (CFL), that learns the appropriate level of analysis and the relation between lesion and cognitive impairment at the same time. The method avoids specifying brain regions and specific outcome measures a priori, allowing for the discovery of new cross-cutting lesion-behavior maps. We show that CFL robustly recovers lesion behavior maps in a simulated dataset where Canonical Correlation Analysis fails to provide interpretable results.

The prion-like domain of CLAMP (PrLD) and a stem-loop structure in the target RNA are essential for the CLAMP-RNA interaction. Moreover, the CLAMP PrLD domain regulates sex-specific splicing by modulating the dynamics of an hnRNPA2/B1 family protein that regulates alternative splicing.

The circuits use multivalent miRNA regulatory interactions to achieve nearly uniform, tunable, protein expression over two orders of magnitude variation in gene dosage.

Beyond shaping coexistence, strong intraspecific competition can also stabilize community dynamics by ensuring that populations return to equilibrium after disturbance. Here we investigate a more fundamental question: how intraspecific competition influences the very existence of a steady state (feasibility) in large random ecological communities dominated by competition. We show that, analogous to classical results on stability, there is a critical level of intraspecific competition above which a feasible steady state is guaranteed to exist. We derive a general expression for the probability of feasibility and prove that, asymptotically (as species number grows), the transition to stability occurs before the transition to feasibility with probability one. Thus, in large competitive communities, any feasible equilibrium is automatically stable. This ordering persists even when many species in the initial pool cannot coexist and extinctions occur: the dynamics prune the community, shifting feasibility and stability thresholds but never reversing their order. These results imply that large competitive communities generically converge to a globally stable equilibrium, making sustained oscillations or chaos unlikely -- consistent with experimental observations.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

HFAbs were evoked by sensory cues and targets, dynamically coupled to low-frequency rhythms. Notably, both the strength of cue-evoked HFAbs and their decoupling from slow rhythms predicted behavioral accuracy. HFAbs synchronized across the brain, revealing distinct cue- and target-activated subnetworks. These subnetworks exhibited lead-lag dynamics following target onset, with cue-activated subnetworks preceding target-activated subnetworks when cues were informative.

The two zebrafish Mylpf genes (mylpfa and mylpfb) are exclusively expressed in fast-twitch muscle, with mylpfa expressed more abundantly than mylpfb. Mutations in both genes cause full mRNA and protein loss, and loss of sarcomere formation. The degree of sarcomere reduction in fast-twitch muscle is predicted by Mylpf protein dosage using a high-slope Hill equation. The sarcomere defect may be driven by thick filament localization, which is impaired in mylpfa-/- and obliterated in mylpfa-/-;mylpfb-/-. Slow-twitch muscle is spared, becoming larger and more active in the mutants. The mylpfa-/- defects can be rescued by Mylpfa-GFP, Mylpfb-GFP, and by human MYLPF-GFP with equivalent efficiency, but not by a MYLPF protein variant that causes Distal Arthrogryposis.

The merozoite is the less studied stage of the IDC, despite its importance for the establishment of infection. Here we uncovered the gene expression profile of the free merozoites, by doing single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). We found that free merozoites express invasion and motility genes that are actively transcribed in schizonts and after merozoite egress. P. falciparum parasites undergo at least one IDC before sexually-committing and transforming into the sexual stages, the gametocytes, which are then transmitted to the mosquito vector. Our scRNA-seq dataset identified two early states of sexual commitment, preceding expression of the gametocytogenesis master regulator ap2-g. We hypothesize that early committed parasites are primed for sexual differentiation and definitive engagement into gametocytogenesis occurs when ap2-g is expressed. Our results contribute to a better understanding of how the parasite prepares for invasion and how it exits asexual growth and enters sexual differentiation. These transitions ensure survival of the parasite in the human host and transmission to the mosquito vector so the gene markers identified here can be therapeutically explored in the future to block malaria invasion or transmission.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Organisms evolved under specific gravitational and radiation regimes; deviations from these conditions --whether in extreme terrestrial environments or beyond Earth-- may alter immune function and pathogen replication.

We employed a fully factorial experimental design, examining how each factor, alone and in combination, influences physiological traits and viral load. While below-background radiation radically affected viral accumulation dynamics, reduced gravity had a minor effect. Both factors significantly impacted reproduction and morphology, with some effects magnified by viral infection.

Although amyloid beta (AB) may inhibit proteasomes, it is unclear if this reflects direct structural interference or indirect toxicity. The proteasome controls a myriad of critical neuronal processes with its disruption potentially driving downstream AD pathology. Methods: We examined the direct impact of distinct AB; forms on proteasome structure, dynamics, and function by evaluating enzyme activity and morphology by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and native-gel electrophoresis. To prevent AB-induced impairments in vitro and in AD animal models, we used allosteric proteasome activating peptidomimetics. We characterized their interactions with proteasome by AI enhanced in silico docking. Results: Toxic soluble AB42 oligomers selectively inhibit 20S and 26S proteasome activity, while monomeric and fibrillar forms and AB40 show minimal inhibitory effects. Morphometric analysis of AFM images suggests AB42 oligomers bind laterally to the 20S proteasomes, and impair proteasome dynamics by disabling gate opening, critical for catalytic activity. Oligomer-decorated proteasomes are locked in catalytically inert cycling between closed and intermediate gate conformations. Oligomeric AB42 also induces disassembly of the 26S complex, increasing content of free 20S cores. Importantly, we show proteasome dysfunction induced by oligomeric AB42 is both preventable and reversible by employing an allosteric proteasome activator TAT-DEN, promoting gate opening and restoring enzymatic activity with the full-cycle of conformational transitions in oligomers-treated proteasomes. In cellular and animal models, restoring proteasome function via TAT-DEN mitigated A{beta}-induced cell death, spatial learning/memory deficits, and survival impairments, even under conditions of pre-established AB deficits. Conclusions: Oligomeric AB42 decorates the lateral sides of the 20S proteasome restricting cycling between conformations and blocking gate opening. It also reduces the pool of 26S proteasomes necessary for the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. We demonstrate proteasome dysfunction can be prevented and reversed by proteasome agonist that lowers 20S affinity to oligomers and promotes allosteric gate opening. We show that proteasome activation with TAT-DEN prevents cognitive deficits in AD animal models. This suggests proteasome dysfunction is a key downstream target in AD pathology and supports proteasome activation as a therapeutic strategy to restore neuronal function in AD.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In contrast, the activation level in the anterior hippocampus positively correlated with sequential distance regardless of the observer's perspectives. These results suggest that the hippocampus stores the memory of the event sequences allocentrically in a perspective-agnostic manner.

J.; De Weerd, P.; Senden, M.", "abstract": "Gamma synchrony is ubiquitous in visual cortex, but whether it contributes to perceptual grouping remains contentious based on observations that gamma frequency is not consistent across stimulus features and that gamma synchrony depends on distances between image elements. These stimulus dependencies have been argued to challenge the idea that the visual system groups image elements by synchronizing the neural assemblies that encode them. Here we argue instead that these dependencies may shape synchrony in perceptually meaningful ways. Indeed, according to the theory of weakly coupled oscillators (TWCO), synchrony-based grouping mechanisms require stimulus dependence. Synchronization among coupled oscillators depends on frequency dissimilarity and coupling strength, which in early visual cortex relate to local feature dissimilarity and physical distance, respectively. We manipulated these factors in a texture segregation experiment wherein human observers identified the orientation of a figure defined by reduced contrast heterogeneity compared to the background. Human performance followed TWCO predictions both qualitatively and quantitatively, as formalized in a computational model. Moreover, we found that when enriched with a Hebbian learning rule, our model also predicted human learning effects: Increases in model gamma synchrony due to perceptual learning predicted improvements in texture segregation across sessions. Taken together, our data suggest that the stimulus-dependence of gamma synchrony captures local image statistics and is linked to the stimulus-dependence of texture segregation, and that the effect of visual experience on gamma synchrony provides a viable perceptual learning mechanism for training-induced improvements in texture segregation. Our results suggest that gamma synchrony with its inherent stimulus dependencies can provide a plausible mechanistic basis for perceptual grouping and visual scene segmentation.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Human listeners reliably discriminated click trains that shared the same average ICI but differed in temporal configuration, and these differences elicited robust mismatch negativity (MMN) responses in an oddball paradigm, indicating automatic cortical deviance detection. Awake rats showed analogous MMN-like ECoG responses to configuration changes, demonstrating cross-species generality.

Reversible cooling of auditory cortex reduced configuration sensitivity in MGB, implicating corticothalamic feedback in shaping thalamic representations. Layer-resolved analyses further showed that supragranular A1 neurons carry stronger configuration-specific adaptation than infragranular neurons.

In T cells of NOD mice and T1D patients, UTX ablation resulted in the accumulation of CD8+ progenitor cells with concomitant deficiency of effectors, suggesting a key role for UTX in poising progenitors for transition to effectors. Mechanistically, the role of UTX in T1D was independent of its inherent histone demethylase activity but instead relied on binding with transcription factors (TCF1 and STAT3) to co-regulate genes important in the maintenance and differentiation of progenitor CD8+ T cells. Together, these findings identify a critical role for UTX in T1D and the UTX:TCF1:STAT3 complex as a therapeutic target for terminating the long-lived autoimmune response.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

BKV strains consist of four distinct genotypes (BKV-I, -II, -III, and -IV) with more than 80% of individuals seropositive for the BKV-I genotype, and lower prevalences of infection or co-infection with the other genotypes. BKV-nephropathy occurs widely in immunosuppressed transplant recipients, with the recommended treatment including reduction of immunosuppressive drugs. High serum titers of BKV-neutralizing antibodies and treatment with BKV-neutralizing intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are associated with reduced levels of BKV-DNAemia in kidney transplant recipients, suggesting anti-BKV antibodies can limit viral load. Thus, we set out to generate broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the viral protein 1 (VP1) major capsid protein of BKV genotypes I-IV using VelocImmune transgenic mice that encode for human immunoglobulins. Hybridoma clones from VelocImmune mice immunized with combinations of BKV I-IV VP1 and respective genotypes of BKV pseudoviruses (BK-PsV) were screened using a high-throughput binding assay against BKV-I VP1 expressed in HEK-293 cells. The VP1-binding hybridoma clones were then assessed for neutralization with BK-PsV consisting of respective VP1 proteins from BKV-I, -II, -III, or -IV on the virion surface. Overall, thirty-six broadly cross-neutralizing mAbs against BKV-I, -II, -III, and -IV -were identified. Twenty of the cross-reactive immunoglobulins were subjected to nucleotide sequencing resulting in six clonotype families with fourteen genetically distinct immunoglobulins. Several of the most effective mAbs were fully humanized with the IgG1 Fc domain and broad neutralization of BK-PsV-I, II, III, and IV genotypes with IC50s ranging from ~7-200 pM.

For wild animals that sleep in groups, individuals may disturb one another, influencing sleep quality and quantity, but this aspect of social sleep has been understudied due to methodological challenges. Here, we test the hypothesis that individual's social dominance can affect sleep opportunities, by studying sleep patterns in a troop of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), a species with a strong hierarchical social structure. First, we show that the troop's night-time sleep (determined by 40Hz acceleration data) is highly synchronised. Next, we link night-time sleep dynamics to daytime spatial networks and dominance hierarchy (from 1Hz GPS data and direct observations). We show that baboon sleep synchrony is higher between similarly ranked individuals, and unexpectedly, more dominant baboons experience less and lower-quality sleep. We propose that this hierarchy effect is explained by higher-ranked baboons resting closer to more group members, which also leads them exerting greater influence on each other's night-time behaviour compared to lower-ranked individuals. Our study provides the first empirical evidence for the impact of social hierarchies on sleep in a wild primate, suggesting that dominance status may impose trade-offs between social rank and the quality and quantity of sleep.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

The pro-oncogenic transcriptional coactivator YAP1 comprises at least eight isoforms, but their specific and overlapping functions in cancer development remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the YAP1-2 isoform, YAP1-2, demonstrates significantly greater activity in inducing nuclear condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) compared to other isoforms. Mechanistically, YAP1-2 interacts specifically with its homologue TAZ via the leucine zipper, as well as with TEADs, which are the prevalent transcriptional partners of YAP1 and TAZ. The tetrameric complex is further assembled multivalently by BRD4 to promote LLPS formation. The resulting YAP1-2/TAZ/TEAD complex binds to super-enhancer elements and strongly enhances pro-oncogenic target gene expression in a BRD4-dependent way. Cancer cells with higher YAP1-2 levels display a clear EMT signature that drives greater malignant traits. Similarly, increased YAP1-2 levels boost pro-oncogenic features such as sphere formation, invasion of the extracellular matrix, and resistance to various stresses, including anti-cancer drugs. In high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), higher YAP1-2 mRNA levels are characterized by nuclear YAP1 biomolecular condensates and associated with more advanced clinical stages. Our study shows that YAP1-2 enhances cancer cell aggressiveness through LLPS formation, suggesting that the LLPS-induced YAP1-2/TAZ/TEAD super-enhancer is a promising target for treating refractory cancers.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

DS mouse models recapitulate these deficits, including sexual dimorphism in long bone alterations. Historically, Ts65Dn mice provided much of the insight behind DS-related skeletal deficits with ~100 trisomic orthologous genes, but there are concerns about genetic fidelity in this model due to included triplication of genes not homologous to Hsa21. A new DS mouse model, Ts66Yah, subtracted the non-Hsa21 homologous trisomic genes from Ts65Dn but has not been evaluated for long bone deficits. Comparing skeletal phenotypes between these models can indicate the contributions of non-Hsa21 trisomic genes and whether the Ts66Yah mouse is relevant as a model for DS-associated skeletal deficits. After assessing individual densitometric, morphometric, and mechanical variables in male and female Ts66Yah femurs at similar ages to when skeletal deficits had been observed in Ts65Dn mice, structural phenotypes were directly compared to those of Ts65Dn mice using a novel multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) method to generate composite scores. Overall, structural and mechanical bone phenotypes of the femur appear milder in Ts66Yah compared to Ts65Dn mice. The appearance of developmental trabecular microarchitecture deficits, but not other abnormalities, were evident earlier in Ts65Dn than Ts66Yah mice. Dyrk1a, a gene triplicated in both models, affected skeletal structure differently in each model, likely through differing gene interactions.

In tomato, the model for fleshy fruit development, both processes are tightly linked to changes in gene expression, including transcriptional regulation and RNA processing. While several transcription factors are implicated in fruit developmental programs, the role of splicing regulators remains largely unexplored. Expression profiling of splicing-related genes revealed expression patterns. The serine/arginine-rich splicing factor RS2Z36 is expressed in ovaries and during early fruit development. Loss-of-function mutations in RS2Z36 result in ovaries with altered patterning and in smaller, ellipsoid fruits. rs2z36 mutants display elongated pericarp cells along the longitudinal axis of pre-anthesis ovaries, indicating that RS2Z36-dependent expansion patterns are established before anthesis. RNA-seq uncovered widespread alternative splicing of genes across diverse biological processes, while proteome analysis revealed altered protein abundance and peptides derived from novel splice variants. In addition, rs2z36-1 pericarps show increased deposition of LM6-recognized arabinan and AGP epitopes.

We employed neuro-cardiac guided TMS in a cohort of healthy participants to examine the effects of stimulation intensity and DLPFC target specificity on heart-brain coupling (HBC). We used generalized additive models to assess nonlinear effects of stimulation intensity and target location on HBC, while accounting for pain ratings and other side effects. Intra-subject repeatability across three sessions was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. We observed a non-linear modulation of HBC depending on stimulation intensity and target location, with greater effects at the F3 lateral and F3 posterior targets compared to sham. By evaluating these effects across sessions within participants, we demonstrate the robustness of our results beyond the influence of pain and other side effects on HBC modulation. Exploratory analyses of the directionality show a consistent decrease in HR only at the F3 lateral target with suprathreshold stimulation. These results demonstrate that HBC is modulated in a target- and intensity-specific manner, with particularly consistent effects at F3 lateral sites within the DLPFC.

Most evidence collected so far has focused on exploring these two phenomena on isolation. Currently, the combined effects of climate change and urbanisation remain underexplored, despite being among the greatest challenges faced by biodiversity. Here, we use a decade-long, individual-based study of urban and forest great tits (Parus major) to analyse urbanisation, climate and their interactive effects on yellow breast colouration, a carotenoid-based trait. We find that urban birds exhibit duller colourations than forest counterparts, being 10-20% less chromatic, with first-year birds and males being more negatively impacted by cities. Additionally, birds in the city are more sexually dichromatic than in the forest. Over the decade, colouration differences between habitats remain stable, following a similar quadratic temporal pattern. Finally, while climate has a weak effect on colouration, urban birds appear more sensitive to its influence than forest birds. Our results indicate urbanisation has a stronger impact than last decade climatic variation on great tit colouration, though both factors may interact. The heightened sensitivity of first-year birds and increased sexual dichromatism in cities may alter the strength of natural and sexual selection on this trait in urban environments.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Suppression of axis proteins is associated with cis-encoded signals, including reduced coding density and the subtelomeric Y' elements, which are present at many chromosome ends, but also requires chromatin modifiers, including the histone methyltransferase Dot1 and the Sir silencing complex. We show that Dot1 suppresses Sir complex activity at least in part independently of its canonical target, H3K79, to downmodulate axis protein deposition near chromosome ends. In parallel, the Sir complex, but not Dot1, suppresses the induction of DSBs by limiting the openness of promoters, the preferred sites of meiotic DSB formation. The separable downmodulation of axis protein deposition and DSB induction likely contributes to the robust reduction of meiotic recombination effectors near chromosome ends.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

These environments harbour diverse microbial communities, including beneficial and pathogenic species, which can influence public health. The COVID-19 pandemic has further underscored the need to monitor microbial ecosystems, particularly with respect to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, which may have escalated due to the increased use of antibiotics during health crises. In a first-of-its-kind study in India, we comprehensively characterized microbial communities and the prevalence of AMR genes in the Chennai Metro system. We collected 96 surface swab samples from 12 stations across two metro lines, targeting four surfaces: bannisters, kiosks, rods, and ticket counters. Forty-seven samples passed quality control and were analysed using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing. We employed taxonomic classification and conducted comparative and diversity analyses, as well as differential taxa profile analyses, across the sample collection objects. We studied the prevalence and abundance of AMR genes using AMR annotations from the CARD database. We performed pangenome analysis by constructing Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from the collected samples and compared them against the reference genome from NCBI. Results: Comparative analysis with global urban microbiome datasets revealed distinct microbial profiles, including eight species that are differentially prevalent in Chennai samples. Surface type significantly influenced microbial diversity, with kiosks displaying the highest diversity levels. We successfully reconstructed several high-quality MAGs, providing insights into the genomic potential and adaptability of dominant taxa in this environment. While the presence of AMR genes was minimal overall, genes associated with Sulfonamide and Rifamycin resistance were detected. Conclusion: These findings highlight unique microbial signatures and emphasize the need for ongoing surveillance and targeted interventions to mitigate microbial transmission risks in densely populated urban areas.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Targeted saturation mutagenesis of these sites resulted in variants exhibiting multi-fold increases in catalytic efficiency while sampling less than 0.6% of total residues. The identified hotspots revealed spatially distinct yet cooperative contributions to catalysis, as further supported by combinatorial mutagenesis and kinetic analyses.

Using hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics, we uncovered an unexpected contrast: despite binding the same sugars, the two families evolved unique \"energetic blueprints\" to support their distinct functional requirements. To test if differences in energetic ensembles have functional consequences, we rationally redesigned the protein fold for tunable ligand-driven transcriptional responses. Strikingly, energy-driven protein engineering produced synthetic transcription factors with the theoretically anticipated ligand-induced transcriptional outputs.

Self-proteins are presented to T cells in the thymus during immune cell development, and must be presented throughout the body to both maintain regulatory T cell populations and provide a tonic signal to maintain conventional T cells over time. The ready observations of continuous apoptosis in some organs together with the ingestion of that material by myeloid populations has led to a conventional understanding of ongoing cell-death as a major source of self-antigens, complemented in some situations by uptake of free-floating cell-derived vesicles. Here, we used a series of companion imaging and vesicular labeling technologies to reveal an alternate process undertaken by macrophages that results in non-destructive and direct sampling of living cells. The process requires cell-cell contact, does not require caspase activation, and takes place via a trogocytosis-like stretching of the target cell into the macrophage, leading to the generation of submicron-sized vesicles containing cytoplasm. Using a high-dimensional flow-based method for labeling vesicles ingested under this versus other conditions, we find that live-sampled material is distinctly processed, is poorly subject to fusion with lysosomes, and produces ensuing differential effects on the presentation of those to CD4 versus CD8 T cells. Disrupting this trafficking by redirecting antigen to the lysosome significantly reduced the associated macrophage-mediated priming of CD8 T cells. This demonstrates an important and substantial sampling of living cells by the immune system, with clear consequences for maintaining the border of immunity.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In contrast, phage lysis of bacteria populations within well-mixed in vitro environments select for the emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants, which in turn select for host-range expansion phage mutants, leading to the emergence of complex cross-infection networks, and eventually the collapse of phage populations altogether. This gap in outcome raises a question: what enables long-term phage-bacteria coexistence? Here, we show how interactions in space can facilitate stable coexistence and long-range transport of virulent phage along with migrating bacteria. Through the joint use of theory, simulation, and experiments across multiple phage-bacteria systems, we reveal a chemotaxis-driven mechanism which robustly stabilizes coexistence and dispersal of virulent phages with migrating hosts, while minimizing the potential for coevolutionary-induced collapse of either bacteria or phage.

B.; Nambiar, A.; Dennison, J. B.; Alloy, L. B.; Fareri, D.; Jarcho, J. M.; Smith, D. V.", "abstract": "Individuals vary substantially in their responses to rewarding events and their motivation to pursue rewards. While the ventral striatum (VS) plays a central role in reward anticipation, its functional connectivity with the default mode network (DMN)-critical for self-referential processing and value integration-potentially represents a key mechanism through which trait differences manifest in reward-related behavior. Here, we examine how trait reward sensitivity and state-level behavioral motivation relate to connectivity between the DMN and VS during reward anticipation. Forty-six participants completed the Monetary Incentive Delay task while undergoing fMRI, with trial types reflecting varying levels of reward and loss salience. Behavioral motivation, indexed by reaction time modulation across high-stakes and low-stakes trials, and self-report measures of anticipatory pleasure and reward sensitivity were assessed. Reward sensitivity interacted with anticipatory pleasure to predict behavioral motivation, such that individuals with higher anticipatory pleasure showed weaker behavioral motivation when reward sensitivity was greater, while those with lower anticipatory pleasure showed stonger behavioral motivation when reward sensitivity was greater. Critically, during high-stakes trials, reward sensitivity was associated with stronger DMN-VS connectivity in highly motivated individuals and weaker connectivity in less motivated participants. This moderation effect was consistent across gain and loss contexts, though with distinct directionality patterns. These findings provide novel insights into the neural correlates of individual differences in reward processing, demonstrating that trait reward sensitivity, anticipatory pleasure, and behavioral motivation are associated with distinct patterns of DMN-VS interactions during reward anticipation. These findings highlight the importance of considering motivational context when investigating reward-related neural mechanisms.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the first cryo-EM structures of mKu in DNA-bound and higher-order super-complex forms, revealing a Ku-mediated DNA synapsis mechanism unique to prokaryotes. Integrating cryo-EM with hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we define key mKu-mKu dimerization, DNA-binding, and synapsis interactions essential for efficient NHEJ, bridging structure with function. In silico mutagenesis and predictive structural modeling identify residues critical for DNA binding and synapsis, with mutations destabilizing synapsis and impairing NHEJ repair. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) confirms DNA-dependent mKu oligomerization in solution, while live-cell imaging captures its spatiotemporal dynamics during DSB repair.

A common approach has been to leverage associations between natural genetic variation and gene expression to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the population 4,5. At the same time, a novel approach uses pooled CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) perturbations of noncoding loci with single-cell transcriptome sequencing 6,7. Here, we systematically harmonized and compared the results from these approaches across hundreds of genomic regions associated with blood cell traits. We find that while the two approaches sometimes identify the same target genes, there are considerable differences that affect biological inferences made from the data. CRISPRi preferentially maps highly proximal, constraint-enriched genes, whereas eQTLs recover multiple, often distal targets. By benchmarking against 1,075 gold-standard CRE-gene pairs linked to blood traits, we show that the two approaches identify largely distinct targets; when combined, they achieve a balance between accuracy and completeness of gene discovery.

We leveraged optical binding assays and single-molecule FRET to observe the structural dynamics of two yeast tRNAs, in isolation, and upon interaction with the conserved pseudouridine synthase Pus4/TruB. We show that unmodified and pseudouridylated tRNAeMet(CAU) and tRNAThr(AGU) all sample open, compact and intermediate conformations, though tRNAThr(AGU) exhibits faster dynamics. Consistent with its role in modifying RNAs with different structural properties, Pus4 binds robustly to unmodified tRNA, tRNA that was pseudouridylated prior to engaging Pus4 (\"pre-modified\"), and even an unrelated riboswitch RNA. Pus4 binding to tRNAeMet(CAU) leads to additional tRNA conformational states. The ensemble of conformations explored by Pus4-bound pre-modified tRNA resolved within minutes back into open, compact and intermediate states. tRNAeMet(CAU) that is initially unmodified more gradually approached the ensemble of structures that were attained rapidly by pre-modified tRNA.

After widespread deployment of the Cf-9 resistance locus, breeders increasingly relied on Cf-6, yet Cf-6-mediated resistance has already been overcome in multiple regions. The molecular basis of this breakdown, and the identity of the matching avirulence (Avr) effector, have remained unresolved. Here, we use comparative genomics and functional genetics to identify the F. fulva effector Avr6 as the previously described apoplastic protein Ecp5. Sequencing of Cf-6-breaking strains revealed either deletion of the Ecp5 locus or non-synonymous mutations in its coding sequence. Using transient expression, targeted gene knockout, and complementation assays, we show that Ecp5 is both necessary and sufficient for Cf-6-mediated recognition and defence activation. We then use Avr6-triggered cell death as a phenotypic marker in a bulked segregant analysis combined with Comparative Subsequence Sets analysis (CoSSa) to map Cf-6 to a ~2 Mb interval on the short arm of chromosome 12 that overlaps the previously described Cf-Ecp5.12 locus. Sequencing of Avr6 in a broad strain collection reveals a predominantly conserved allele under apparent purifying selection, with recent independent loss-of-function variants in Europe and South America that confer virulence on Cf-6 plants. Together, these findings establish the Avr6-Cf-6 gene-for-gene pair, explain the erosion of Cf-6-mediated resistance, and illustrate how effector loss or mutation provides a rapid route for F. fulva adaptation, with important implications for designing more durable resistance strategies against tomato leaf mold.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Although KRAS mutations are highly frequent in human IPMNs, KRAS activation in pancreatic ductal cells alone fails to recapitulate IPMN development in murine models, indicating that additional tumor-suppressive mechanisms must be overcome. Objective: The objective was to determine whether loss of the transcription factor HNF1B predisposes to initiation of IPMN. Design: We assessed HNF1B nuclear expression and promoter methylation in resected human IPMN specimens. To model IPMN initiation, we generated mice with ductal-specific inactivation of Hnf1b, alone or combined with KRASG12D. Ductal organoids and RNA-sequencing were used to investigate molecular mechanisms. Transcriptomic analyses were also performed on human IPMN surgical specimens. MRI from germline HNF1B mutation/deletion carriers was re-evaluated for IPMN prevalence. Results: Human IPMNs showed loss of HNF1B by immunochemistry, with enrichment to promoter methylation that increased with dysplasia grade. The KHC model recapitulated the key features of IPMN development including ductal dilation, high proliferation, papillary architecture and mucin production. Loss of Hnf1b together with Kras activation induced loss of primary cilia, cellular reprogramming and engaged oncogenic YAP and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, similar to human IPMNs. Moreover, germline HNF1B carriers exhibited a markedly increased prevalence of branch-duct IPMN. Conclusion: HNF1B functions as a tumor-suppressive gatekeeper of pancreatic ductal cells. These findings highlight HNF1B inactivation as a potential biomarker and therapeutic entry point for early interception of IPMN-driven pancreatic cancer.

We found that elevational differentiation resulted in a greater accumulation of selective sweep signatures over the five-million-year timespan covered by our dataset, supporting the importance of divergent selection. Nevertheless, lowland-restricted species pairs accumulated more selective sweeps over the most recent two million years, suggesting that parallel selection, driven by major Pleistocene glacial cycles, produced faster evolutionary change than divergent selection in elevationally differentiated species pairs.

Here we report that in fish, males exhibit stronger antiviral immune responses, the male-biased gene cyp17a2 as a critical mediator of this enhanced response. First, we observed that male zebrafish exhibit enhanced antiviral resistance compared to females, and notably, zebrafish lack sex chromosomes. Through transcriptomic screening, we found that cyp17a2 was specifically highly expressed in male fish. Cyp17a2 knockout males were equivalent to wild-type males in terms of sex organs and androgen secretion, but the ability to upregulate IFN as well as antiviral resistance was greatly reduced. Then, Cyp17a2 is identified as a positive IFN regulator which located at endoplasmic reticulum, and specifically interacts with and enhances STING mediated antiviral responses. Mechanistically, Cyp17a2 stabiles STING expression by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase bloodthirsty-related gene family member 32 (btr32), which facilitates K33-linked polyubiquitination. The capacity of IFN induction of Cyp17a2 was abolished when STING is knockdown. Meanwhile, Cyp17a2 also attenuates viral infection directly to strengthen the antiviral capacity as an antiviral protein, Cyp17a2 degrades the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) P protein by utilizing USP8 to reduce its K33-linked polyubiquitination.

Quantification of power stroke remains under debate and its correlation with translocation fidelity has not been observed. In this work, we use quantum sensing techniques for measuring both the EF-G power stroke and its influence on ribosome translocation steps. Two EF-G mutants, H584K and Q508K, were expressed, with the mutated residues directly interacting with tRNA. H584K, which interacts on codon-anticodon minihelix, produced less power stroke of 60{+/-}6 pN and induced -1 frameshifting, wherein the ribosome translocated only two nucleotides. In contrast, Q508K, which interacts with tRNA residue 37 immediately outside the codon-anticodon minihelix, exhibited a normal power stroke of 89{+/-}11 pN and maintained canonical 3-nucleotide translocation.

A core feature of ToM is its recursive structure: individuals reason not only about what others think, but also about what others think about them. Existing computational models typically assume that ToM Level-0 (L0) agents rely on a fixed heuristic (e.g., Win-Stay Lose-Shift, WSLS), an assumption that fails to capture the diversity of non-mentalizing strategies humans actually use. Here we introduce BELIEFS, a probabilistic ToM framework that infers latent L0 strategies directly from behavior using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that enables flexible tracking of elemental strategies and dynamic switches between them without relying on a single predefined heuristics. A second HMM tracks the beliefs about the Opponent's ToM level and dynamic changes therein. We evaluated BELIEFS across four classic dyadic games (Matching Pennies, Prisoner's Dilemma, Bach or Stravinsky, Stag Hunt) under varying learning rates and volatility of strategy switches. Predictive performance, quantified via cumulative negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the opponent's choices, was compared against chance and a WSLS-based ToM model, with BELIEFS consistently achieving superior accuracy across conditions. Strategy inference was assessed using trial-wise confusion matrices and Cohen's k, revealing robust above-chance classification. Additionally, separability of ToM levels across games indicated that competitive games are particularly informative for distinguishing recursive reasoning from deterministic L0 strategies. The model also successfully tracked the opponent's recursive reasoning depth (i.e. ToM level) by distinguishing action sequences generated by L0 versus L1 opponents. Parameter-recovery analyses confirmed reliable estimation of core transition parameters. Together, these results show that BELIEFS provides a flexible, computationally grounded account of human ToM, jointly inferring surface-level strategies and recursive reasoning, with applications to modeling adaptive behavior in dynamic interactive environments.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

RAD18 is also frequently overexpressed and pathologically activated in cancer cells. However, the extent to which RAD18 shapes cancer genomes and impacts tumorigenesis is unclear. Therefore, we tested the effect of Rad18 status on chemically-induced and oncogene-driven tumorigenesis. In a chemically-induced oral carcinogenesis model, acute (2-16 days) 4NQO-treatment induces expression of Rad18 and TLS polymerase mRNAs in mouse oral epithelial cells prior to emergence of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). Chronic (8 week) 4NQO-treatment leads to onset of oral tumors that is accelerated in Rad18-/- mice when compared with Rad18+/+ animals. Analysis of OSCC exomes reveals increased levels of G(C)>T(A) transversions in Rad18-/- tumors when compared with Rad18+/+. Therefore, Rad18 promotes error-free bypass of 4NQO-induced DNA lesions and suppresses 4NQO-induced oral carcinogenesis. In a KrasG12D-induced lung carcinogenesis model, Rad18-deficiency did not affect rates or incidence of oncogene-induced lung tumors or mutations.

Antiviral drugs are modeled as fine liquid droplets forming a thin film on airway walls along the initial infection zones. The method employs an Eulerian-Lagrangian discrete phase model (DPM) to track droplet trajectories in bulk airflows and combines it with the Eulerian wall film (EWF) model to simulate post-deposition film behavior. Thus, this strategy overcomes the limitations of previous investigations that relied solely on DPM and ignored post-impact drug behavior. Moreover, the investigations uniquely explore the effects of short and forceful breathing of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients over the ideal and realistic healthy persons' breathing to build an exhaustive understanding of drug deposition dynamics. The disease-specific analysis examines airflow dynamics, film thickness, deposition efficiency, and surface area coverage for 1-10 {micro} particle sizes. Results reveal that COPD inhalation completely changes the deposition dynamics between the upper and lower lobes compared to the ideal and healthy breathing cases. The deposition efficiency in the upper airway (~5.28%) is higher than in the lower airways (~2.52%). A similar shift is observed in the surface area coverage, which is found to be maximum in the carina for the COPD case rather than the left lower lobe (LLL) for ideal and healthy profiles, limiting deep lung delivery.

To address this problem, we explore hyperdimensional computing (HDC), an emerging brain-inspired computational paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vectors and simple arithmetic operations to represent and manipulate complex patterns, as an alternative approach in the context of supervised machine learning. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of HDC against established machine learning techniques across a range of classification tasks. As a representative use case, we focus on classifying heterogeneous metagenomic samples based on their quantitative microbial profiles, using publicly available microbiome datasets. Our results demonstrate that HDC achieves comparable, and in some cases, superior classification accuracy to classical methods. Furthermore, our findings highlight the potential of HDC for improved computational efficiency, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets, suggesting the HDC-based classifier as a promising tool for bioinformatics research, particularly in areas characterized by high-dimensional data.

A well-known example is the specialized association of Drosophila sechellia with noni fruit (Morinda citrifolia), which is toxic to most other insects, including the closely-related drosophilids D. simulans and D. melanogaster. Noni toxicity is due to its high concentration of octanoic acid (OA), but the mechanisms that determine sensitivity or resistance to OA remain poorly understood. Here, we experimentally-evolved D. simulans with increased OA resistance, identifying multiple loci under selection. Cross-referencing these with a genome-wide, OA-resistance CRISPR screen in a D. melanogaster cell line highlighted two proteins: Kraken, a putative detoxification enzyme expressed in digestive and renal tissues, and Alkbh7, a mitochondrial protein linked to fatty acid metabolism. Both genes show elevated expression in D. sechellia and OA-resistant D. simulans. In D. melanogaster, kraken mutants are more OA-sensitive, while Alkbh7 overexpression increased OA resistance. Importantly, mutation of these genes in D. sechellia reduced OA tolerance.

Combining these data with palaeoclimatic reconstructions and present-day aridity indices, we investigate, from a spatio-temporal perspective, how intraspecific genetic variation relates to aridity. Inference of past effective population size revealed a sharp decline in the late Pleistocene, coinciding with regional aridification and potentially reflecting changes in connectivity during dry periods. Current population structure followed a pattern of isolation by distance and mirrored the aridity gradient. Genotype-Environment Association analyses identified SNPs and genes significantly associated with aridity and genetically differentiated among populations, with functions related to water and energy conservation - as expected under arid conditions - as well as neurotransmission.

More broadly, our integrative genomics approach suggests that aridity shapes population connectivity and adaptation, with implications for climate resilience.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

L.; Tapparello, C.; Adeli, E.; Vankee-Lin, F.", "abstract": "Background: Cognitive training aims to prevent or slow cognitive decline in older adults, but outcomes vary widely. Engagement, describing how individuals allocate cognitive, affective, and physiological resources, is critical to training benefits, yet behavioral metrics lack real-time modeling of attention and do not reliably predict outcomes. We developed and validated a multimodal, AI-assisted biomarker that quantifies attentional states during computerized cognitive training and predicts cognitive improvements. Methods: We designed the Attentional Index using Digital measures (AID), leveraging a video-based facial expression encoder (pretrained on 38,935 videos), an ECG-based autonomic encoder (pretrained on 123,998 ECG samples), and a temporal fusion module. Using two processing speed/attention studies in older adults (> 65 years) with mild cognitive impairment, AID was trained and evaluated in BREATHE (n=50; ~300 hours from 368 sessions) and validated in FACE (n=20; ~150 hours from 219 sessions). Model training targeted session-level change in self-reported fatigue. Clinical validation tested relationships between AID scores and (1) behavioral attention, (2) cognitive outcomes, and (3) neural correlates. Findings: AID accurately detected engagement changes (BREATHE: accuracy 0.82, F1=0.81; FACE: accuracy 0.73, F1=0.74), outperforming unimodal models. AID scores were unrelated to session, task type, or demographics. In BREATHE, session-level AID scores significantly predicted executive function improvement (sessionxAID: Wald^2=7.85, p=0.005), whereas reaction time variability did not. Lower AID intercepts (B=-0.07{+/-}0.03, p=0.043) and steeper slopes (B=0.31{+/-}0.15, p=0.046) were associated with greater improvements. Post hoc analyses identified two engagement profiles linked to better attention: one characterized by low-RMSSD and focused periocular activation, and the other defined by coherent alignment between low-RMSSD and facial expression patterns. Interpretation: AID provides a reliable digital biomarker of effective engagement and predicts cognitive improvement beyond behavioral metrics. By capturing facial-autonomic dynamics of attention, AID offers a foundation for closed-loop cognitive intervention design.

BANDOL correctly predicted survival ranking in 75% of patient pairs and outperformed mutation-based models (time-dependent AUC: 0.9-1 vs. 0.4-0.9). Immune activation signatures correlated with a longer OS after therapy, while a shorter OS was linked to TREM2 myeloid cells, B cells, and leptin signaling. Model robustness was confirmed in two independent The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts (uterine, glioma cancers). Epigenetic features were the strongest OS predictors for BANDOL.

Using longitudinal plasma proteomics analyses in humans achieving 14% CR for 2 years, we identified that inhibition of the complement pathway is linked to lower inflammaging. The protein C3a (and its cleaved form) was significantly lowered by CR, thus reducing inflammation emanating from three canonical complement pathways. Interestingly, circulating C3a levels are increased during aging in mice, with visceral adipose tissue macrophages as the predominant source. In macrophages, C3a signaling via ERK elevated inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting the existence of an autocrine loop that promotes inflammaging. Notably, long-lived FGF21-overexpressing mice and PLA2G7-deficient mice exhibited lower C3a in aging. Specific small molecule-mediated systemic C3 inhibition reduced inflammaging, improved metabolic homeostasis, and enhanced healthspan of aged mice.

Here, we investigate the ecological determinants of the interaction between a highly diverse set of 23 phages isolated from diseased apricot trees and 44 bacterial strains from the Pseudomonas syringae species complex collected either from diseased apricot trees, healthy plants or non-agricultural environment. Based on their ecological origin, we expected phages to preferentially infect bacterial strains from the same ecological context, forming modular host-range patterns. Contrary to these expectations, we discovered a significantly nested structure, suggesting generalised infection dynamics rather than local adaptation, primarily driven by the broad ecological dynamics of this pathosystem. Analysis of the bacterial genomes showed that both the profiles of anti-phage defence systems and the distribution profiles of prophages are strongly shaped by bacterial phylogeny. Furthermore, while the number of defence systems showed limited correlation with the breadth of bacterial sensitivity to phages, prophage abundance exhibited a strong, non-linear link with phage virulence. Together, these findings provide an ecological and evolutionary perspective on phage-bacterium infection networks and new insights into a better understanding of the role of phages in agricultural ecosystems.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

L.; Laporte, D.; DAIGNAN-FORNIER, B.", "abstract": "Multicellularity has emerged in the three branches of the tree of life. The formation of simple multicellular entities can either result from cells aggregating or staying together after mitosis. However, it is not yet fully understood how, once formed, these simple multicellular entities could be maintained or even selected for. Here, using the ace2 yeast snowflake model of simple multicellularity, we aimed at identifying genetic conditions favoring its maintenance. Growth-competition experiments revealed that, while the ace2 mutation by itself does not provide any fitness advantage or disadvantage, the ace2 snowflakes were strongly selected when combined to conditions affecting regulators of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, such as Cln3 or Whi5. We show that this selection results from a faster exit from quiescence of the ace2 snowflake cells. Importantly, this advantage is not dependent on the multicellular phenotype, but rather on the ace2 genotype itself. We found that the ace2 selective advantage in the cln3 background fully depends on the KSS1 gene, a target of the Ace2 transcription factor. Finally, we show that phenotypes observed for ace2 mutants are phenocopied by the AMN1368D allelic form found in non-laboratory yeast strains, hence adding physiological relevance to these observations. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that simple multicellularity could persist, not because it provides a direct selective advantage due to multicellularity itself, but rather as a passenger phenotype that is maintained alongside other selected traits.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

However, few in vivo models enable studying how stem cell fates are specified as neurons in an adult body. The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea provides a powerful system for investigating these mechanisms, owing to its abundant adult pluripotent stem cells, termed neoblasts, and its capacity to regenerate a molecularly complex nervous system. The SoxB1 family of transcription factors is broadly implicated in ectodermal lineage commitment. In planarians, the SoxB1 homolog soxB1-2 has been shown to promote neural and epidermal differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which soxB1-2 influences chromatin dynamics and transcriptional programs during adult neurogenesis remain unknown. To address this, we performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on neural-rich head tissues to assess how soxB1-2 RNAi knockdown alters chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Disrupting soxB1-2 resulted in reduced chromatin accessibility and transcriptional downregulation at neural and epidermal loci, consistent with a pioneer-like role in chromatin priming. We identified 31 candidate downstream targets with concordant accessibility and expression changes, including the transcription factors castor and mecom, which regulate mechanosensory and ion transport genes. Head tissue sampling enabled the detection of soxB1-2-responsive genes within rare neural subtypes that were missed in our previous whole-body RNA-seq experiments. These findings offer mechanistic insight into adult ectodermal lineage specification and establish a framework for understanding chromatin-mediated neurogenesis in regenerative systems.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Profound insight exists into how neural computations arise from the precise regulation of ion channels (Armstrong et al., 1998; Lai, Jan, 2006; Nusser et al., 2012), how degenerate channel properties support similar computations (Marder, Prinz, 2002; Marder, Goaillard, 2006), and how channelopathies affect brain function (Kullmann, 2010). However, it remains elusive why neurons express many more channels, and isoforms thereof, than required to tune their specific excitabilities. Here, we employ an experiment-theory approach pairing electrophysiology with Drosophila genetics, and mathematical modelling to show that the variance in membrane properties that results from ion channel diversity promotes the robustness of neuron-type specific functions. Specifically, we show that the robustness of flight motoneuron coding properties to internal and external perturbations is significantly enhanced by the diversity of calcium channel splice isoforms expressed. Importantly, increased excitability robustness to perturbations of outward currents or temperature does not require adjustments in calcium channel mean properties. Instead, increases of the variance of calcium channel gating properties that result from channel isoform diversity broaden the dynamic input range the neuron can compute without reaching depolarization block. This broadens our concept of the functional consequences of the tremendous variety and diversity of ion channels expressed in brains.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

MAP7 loss disrupts apical architecture, causes ectopic tight junction expansion, and prevents lumen formation during the first wave of spermatogenesis. Although microtubule stability is largely preserved in Map7-deficient Sertoli cells, their orientation is severely disrupted, indicating that MAP7 directs dynamic remodeling for proper apical organization. Proteomics shows that MAP7 associates with MYH9 and MYH10, and MYH9, normally enriched at luminal regions where microtubules and F-actin converge, becomes diffuse by Map7 knockout, suggesting that MAP7 mediates spatial coupling of microtubules and actomyosin. Single-cell RNA sequencing shows that Sertoli cell differentiation largely persists without MAP7, whereas germ cells exhibit delayed meiotic progression with expanded pachytene subtypes.

Using inducible, germline-specific HRDE-1 depletion combined with nuclear sorting, CUT&Tag, and nascent transcription profiling, we identified endogenous genes that become transcriptionally activated upon loss of HRDE-1 despite retaining H3K9me3 and H3K23me3. HRDE-1 directly restrains RNA polymerase II (Pol II) while simultaneously promoting polyUG-dependent amplification of antisense 22G-RNAs in perinuclear condensates, thereby coupling nuclear transcriptional repression to small RNA biogenesis. HRDE-1 loss causes progressive erosion of 22G-RNAs and delays silencing re-establishment, revealing a transgenerational feedback loop in which small RNAs, and not chromatin modifications, constitute the primary heritable signal.

We experimentally trimmed ventral feathers from male tree swallows to create a thermal window through which they could dissipate heat. We remotely monitored provisioning rate and core body temperature of males and their female partners. At high temperatures, all males decreased their nestling provisioning rates irrespective of trimming treatment. In addition, trimmed males maintained core body temperatures similar to those of controls. This suggests that in contrast to previous work with females, males limit provisioning rates to levels below the threshold at which they would overheat. Regardless of male treatment, females adjusted their own activity to match that of their male partners; whether there are costs to females is unknown.

While genetic adaptation creates persistent change within a population via allele frequency shifts, reversible plastic phenotypes can be inherited through non-genetic mechanisms. However, most transgenerational plasticity studies examine generations where direct embryonic or germline exposure to environmental cues cannot be excluded. Empirical evidence for persistence definitively beyond the critical threshold for distinguishing true transgenerational plasticity from in utero exposure remains scarce, particularly for vertebrate predator-induced defenses. We measured phenotypic effects of vertebrate predator exposure in the clonally reproducing water flea, Daphnia lumholtzi, isolating environmental effects from genetic variation. We exposed the F0 generation to fish conditioned media, then measured morphological defenses in definitively unexposed F3, F4, and F5 generations characterizing the temporal dynamics of non-genetic inheritance. Predator-induced morphologies persisted through F4 before receding in F5, demonstrating that non-genetic effects extend well beyond the embryonically exposed F1 and germ cell exposed F2 generations. This provides rare empirical evidence for transgenerational plasticity lasting through F4, without confounding genetic variation. We also examined ontogenetic patterns of somatic and defensive trait development, revealing trait-specific temporal dynamics in transgenerational effect expression and decay. These results highlight how current and ancestral environments interact to determine phenotypic variation across generations and underscores the ecological significance of non-genetic inheritance in natural populations, particularly for understanding population responses to environmental change and predator reintroduction. Characterizing molecular mechanisms underlying transgenerational phenotypic plasticity remains critical for predicting persistence and ecological consequences of non-genetic inheritance.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

By accurately mapping cells in tissue space, Tangram2 disentangles interaction-driven transcriptional shifts from intrinsic identity markers, yielding mechanistic CCC maps. Validation across diverse settings-including Slide-tags, co-cultured experiments, human lymph nodes, and simulations-demonstrates high accuracy.

M.", "abstract": "Meiotic drive is a phenomenon that violates Mendel's Law of Equal Segregation, leading to biased transmission of the meiotic driver to the offspring. D. melanogaster Stellate (Ste) is an X-linked meiotic driver that preferentially harms Y-chromosome-bearing spermatids, thereby favoring the transmission of the X chromosome to the next generation. We have recently shown that Ste protein segregates asymmetrically during meiosis I with a strong bias toward the Y-chromosome-inheriting side, leading to the eventual demise of the Y-chromosome-containing spermatids. However, the cellular mechanisms by which Ste protein interferes with spermatid development remain unknown. Here, we show that Ste-containing spermatids are delayed in the process of nuclear envelope remodeling, an essential process during sperm DNA compaction. We show that components of the nuclear lamina (such as Lamin Dm0, and the LEM domain proteins Otefin and Bocks) are rapidly removed during nuclear envelope remodeling during the early stages of normal spermatid development. However, Ste-containing spermatid retained these nuclear lamina proteins for a prolonged time. Their delayed removal is associated with defective formation of the dense complex, which is composed of a bundle of microtubules and serves as a structural support for sperm nuclear morphogenesis. Defective dense complex formation in Ste-containing spermatids led to defective sperm DNA compaction. Together, the present study reveals an unexpected cellular mechanism by which a meiotic driver, Ste, sabotages sperm development.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

A mechanistic understanding therefore requires mapping cellular identity and connectivity at single-cell resolution. Here we define the cellular taxonomy of the murine sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD), a critical hub for REM sleep, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We identified all major brain cell classes, with oligodendrocytes as the most abundant, and resolved seventeen transcriptionally distinct neuronal groups defined by neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neuropeptides, each with unique molecular signatures. Projection-specific analysis further revealed that glutamatergic subpopulations targeting the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and ventral medulla are molecularly distinct, marked by characteristic receptor motifs. Strikingly, we provide the first direct evidence that SLDGLUT neurons innervate the vlPAG. This newly uncovered SLDGLUT-vlPAG pathway represents a previously unrecognized circuit node for REM sleep regulation, with the potential to act as a REM-OFF population suppressing it. Together, these findings establish a transcriptionally resolved atlas of the SLD, reveal the molecular logic of its circuit connectivity, and nominate candidate molecular actuators of REM sleep control, opening new avenues for dissecting how brainstem circuits orchestrate REM state and its transitions.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

These and other active sampling behaviours embody navigational uncertainty, and are key for spatial learning, yet their neural basis remains unclear and existing models impose scanning behaviours rather than explaining its emergence. Here, we show that scanning can emerge spontaneously from the same conserved neural circuits used for goal-directed navigation, without requiring a specialized scanning module. We built a biologically grounded model combining central complex (CX) steering, lateral accessory lobe (LAL) oscillators, and stochastic inhibition of forward speed. This minimal system produced diverse, realistic scan dynamics; saccades, fixations and reversals, whose features were qualitatively compared to high-speed video recordings of Melophorus bagoti scanning. Detailed analysis of these natural scans confirmed model predictions, including how scan structure depends on oscillator phase, goal-heading deviation, and navigational uncertainty. Furthermore, the model reveals that simple modulation of forward speed unifies a broad range of behaviors across ant species, from dashes to smooth oscillatory trajectories to pirouettes and voltes. Crucially, it establishes a general distributed control principle; where forward speed acts as a single adjustable parameter regulating the balance between goal-driven exploitation and information-seeking exploration, without requiring centralized decision-making processes.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Neurobehavioral disorders, ranging from depression to schizophrenia, have been found to display immune system alterations. The high incidence of comorbidity of these disorders, particularly depression, with chronic inflammatory conditions suggests shared mechanisms contributing to the manifestation of these conditions. We have previously shown that peripheral modulation of the innate immune system in mice rapidly triggers enhanced serotonin (5-HT) clearance in vivo associated with increased anxiety- and despair-like behaviors that can be suppressed by serotonergic elimination of p38 MAPK. Forebrain-projecting 5-HT synthesizing neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT) play a key role in regulating behaviors related to mood and anxiety and whose perturbations are observed in multiple affective disorders. Here we identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms that can translate peripheral innate immune system activation into changes in 5-HT signaling capacity. Using whole cell patch clamp recordings from acute midbrain slices, we demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1{beta}, acts cell autonomously through its receptor, IL-1R1, via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to rapidly inhibit firing of DRN5-HT neurons. In the dorsal hippocampus, we found that as with acute, peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, local injections of IL-1{beta} rapidly enhance 5-HT clearance as assessed by in vivo chronoamperometry. Like IL-1{beta}, TNF also acts via a serotonergic p38 MAPK dependent pathway to reduce excitability of DRN5-HT neurons. Immunocytochemical studies reveal that, IL-1R1, is nonuniformly expressed by DRN5-HT neurons and is required for LPS-induced inhibition of these cells as detected by cFos activation, with sex-dependent patterns evident. Moreover, we detected both DRN5-HT IL-1R1-dependent and -independent LPS-mediated changes in cFos changes in forbrain projection areas. Our findings support a growing appreciation that serotoninergic neurons contribute to changes in CNS physiology and behavior following peripheral immune activation. More specifically, our studies attest to a functional role of serotonergic IL-1R1 in mediating IL-1{beta} following peripheral innate immune activation, effects likely to arise both from changes in diminished 5-HT neuron excitability and elevated 5-HT clearance.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) represent a major genetic cause of familial ALS, driving motor neuron degeneration through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. Although gene silencing approaches targeting SOD1 show substantial therapeutic potential, their clinical translation remains restricted by suboptimal delivery to the spinal motor neurons and safety concerns linked to conventional viral vectors. This study presents a minimally invasive gene therapy strategy that combines the retrograde transport capability of rAAV2-retro with the safety of an artificial microRNA (miRNA) to achieve pan-spinal SOD1 silencing. A single intramuscular injection of rAAV2-retro-miRNA into neonatal SOD1G93A mice resulted in widespread transduction of spinal motor neurons, significant reduction of mutant SOD1 protein, and multifaceted therapeutic benefits. Treated mice exhibited delayed disease onset, extended lifespan, preserved motor function, reduced neuroinflammation, and protection of neuromuscular junctions and spinal motor neurons. Importantly, the artificial miRNA construct demonstrated a superior safety profile relative to short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based constructs, which induced marked toxicity and lethality in wild-type mice. These findings establish neonatal intramuscular delivery of rAAV2-retro-miRNA as a safe, efficient, and clinically translatable strategy for preemptive intervention in SOD1-mediated ALS, offering broader applicability to other motor neuron diseases.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Comprehensive assessments rarely combine measures of imagery generation, maintenance, and manipulation. We developed and validated a combination of tests to assess these processes of movement imagery, online. 180 healthy individuals completed the MIQ-RS questionnaire (generation), the Imagined Finger Sequence Task (iFST; maintenance), and the Hand Laterality Judgement Task (HLJT; manipulation). MIQ-RS showed a bifactorial structure (visual and kinesthetic modalities) according to confirmatory factor analysis, and its reliability (internal consistency) was good. In the iFST, internal validity analyses via generalized mixed models showed a clear effect of sequence complexity, stronger for execution than imagery. Reliability, estimated via signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) using hierarchical Bayesian models, was also adequate (SNR > 1.6). In the HLJT, expected effects of rotation angle, hand view, and their interaction, consistent with biomechanical constraints, were also found. Reliability was also adequate (SNR > 1.75). Criterion validity across tests, assessed using Bayesian Spearman correlations, showed that correlations were generally absent (BF01 > 3), and when present, of small magnitude (r < 0.27). Test-retest reliability (122 participants reassessed 6-8 days after), computed via Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs), was generally adequate (ICCs > 0.67). We conclude that the online versions of these tests showed adequate structural/internal validity and (test-retest) reliability.

Polycomb targets form extremely long-range loops (long Polycomb loops) that can separate anchors up to 60 Mb. These loops predominantly occur in cells of self-renewal status such as human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC), but rarely in cell lines. To identify long Polycomb loops in cancer, we initiated a pan-cancer survey of long Polycomb loops in a collection of 235 tumor samples (33 acute myeloid leukemias, 17 Breast cancer samples, 63 pediatric brain tumors, 70 prostate cancers, and 42 colon cancers). We found most cancers, including all prostate cancers and colon cancers, lack long Polycomb loops except pediatric brain tumors and certain AMLs. In pediatric brain tumors, we found the ependymoma PFA subtype (which shows globally depleted H3K27me3) notably displayed strong long Polycomb loop interactions. AML displayed more diverse levels of long Polycomb loop interactions. Most AMLs lost both long Polycomb loops with Polycomb binding loss at the loop anchors. Whereas 10% of AMLs retain long Polycomb loops as strong as in HSCs. These AMLs recurrently carry mutations in CEBPA and STAG2, which are not associated with the Polycomb complex or DNA methylation machinery. We found that long Polycomb loop strong AML is sensitive to EZH2 inhibition, which induces cell differentiation. Conversely, PRC1 component dependency can be used to predict long Polycomb loop formation in B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Our analysis suggests that the oncogenesis process antagonizes the long Polycomb loop maintenance in most cancers, yet certain cancers may still preserve strong long Polycomb loops from cell-of-origin. The maintenance of long Polycomb loops sensitizes cells to Polycomb inhibition, indicating that such loops could be an epigenomic biomarker for pharmacological or genetic Polycomb inhibition.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Cross-temporal decoding exhibited localized generalization, and decoding accuracy increased with wider temporal windows, indicating that apparent persistence can emerge from temporally interleaved activity across neurons. We further developed a feature-based, putative cell-type classifier that revealed distinct circuit contributions: pyramidal neurons expressed content in burst-aligned events during maintenance, whereas interneurons were strongly modulated by memory load and behavior.

A feature associated with the disease is the reduced stiffness of Descemets membrane. However, the effects of this change in Descemets membrane, on corneal endothelial cell health are not well understood. To explore this, we used in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies to investigate how changes in substrate stiffness and the signaling pathways associated with these changes influence corneal endothelial functions. Methods: For in-vitro studies, we cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells for 96 hours on stiff (32 kPa) and soft (8 kPa) substrate CytoSoft plates. By using Jess immunoassay and traditional western blotting, we evaluated changes in integrin signaling components, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis, autophagy, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway markers. Mitochondrial health and mitochondrial superoxide levels were assessed using commercial kits. We assessed the protein levels of the above-mentioned markers in the Col8a2Q455K/Q455K FECD mouse model. To evaluate whether FAK signaling contributes to the FECD pathogenesis, we injected the Col8a2Q455K/Q455K mice with an FAK inhibitor and assessed the corneal phenotypes. Results: We observed increased levels of phosphorylated FAK, integrins alpha 4 and alpha 5 in bovine corneal endothelial cells cultured on soft substrate. We also found upregulated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) markers, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis in cells grown on soft substrate. In the Col8a2Q455K/Q455K mouse model of FECD, there was increased pFAK Y397 levels coincident with the onset of phenotypes. Intraperitoneal injections of a pFAK inhibitor improved antioxidant protein expression and decreased EndMT; however, it did not improve FECD-associated disease progression. Conclusion: In this study, we explored how changes in the physical characteristics of the Descemets membrane impact corneal endothelial cell health. While we discovered activation of Focal adhesion kinase as a result of stiffness changes, its inhibition alone was insufficient to improve cell health in an FECD mouse model.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

The lateral amygdala exhibited early fear-specific responses, characterized by higher decoding accuracy and increased theta/alpha-band (4-12 Hz) power, and transmitted this fear-related information to the medial amygdala, which showed delayed and sustained activation. By contrast, the medial amygdala encoded face-specific information at later stages in the 2-16 Hz band with superior decoding accuracy and then relayed this information back to the lateral amygdala. Intracranial stimulation produced a double dissociation in behavior, with lateral amygdala stimulation disrupting fear detection, whereas medial amygdala stimulation selectively accelerated neutral-face recognition.

Here, we present a manually curated GEM of EcN that, for the first time, incorporates the energetic costs associated with its cryptic plasmids. Inclusion of a plasmid-specific module improved biomass yield predictions and overall model accuracy, providing a more physiologically realistic representation of EcN metabolism. Using COBRA methodologies and possibilistic metabolic flux analysis, this model and previous EcN reconstructions were systematically compared to evaluate the trade-off between model complexity and predictive performance.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease, microglia contribute to inflammation and tissue damage, but can also support repair by clearing myelin debris, limiting inflammation and promoting remyelination and neuroprotection. The timely transition from their pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative states is essential for effective repair and, in chronic MS, persistent, defective microglial activation contributes to disease progression. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the microglial switch remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that neuronal activity can modulate microglial signature at the onset of remyelination in MS models, in a pattern-dependent manner. Transcriptomic analyses reveal a downregulation of pro-inflammatory, disease-associated microglial signatures alongside an upregulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, indicative of a shift toward pro-regenerative states following physiological activity enhancement. This activity-dependent reprogramming also extends to infiltrating monocytes and macrophages, collectively fostering a microenvironment favoring repair.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Tobacco companies responded by introducing \"non-menthol\" cigarettes in which menthol was replaced with WS-3, an odorless synthetic cooling agent to elicit cooling sensations similar to menthol. Legislation enacted in 2024 banned the addition of cooling characterizing flavours in tobacco products in California. However, the industry continues to market \"non-menthol\" cigarettes in the state, with very similar package designs. It is unknown whether these cigarettes contain a cooling agent.\n\nMethodsAvailable Newport-branded \"non-menthol\" cigarettes were purchased in California in 2025, extracted and tested for sensory cooling activity by Ca2+ microfluorimetry of HEK293T cells expressing the human TRPM8 cold/menthol receptor. Chemical analysis was performed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GCMS). \"Non-menthol\" and menthol cigarettes marketed in 2023-24 served as controls.\n\nResultsExtracts from Newport-branded \"non-menthol\" cigarettes marketed in California in 2025 did not elicit sensory cooling activity. Chemical analysis confirmed the absence of menthol and any of the major commercial synthetic cooling agents.\n\nConclusionsWhile the tobacco industry complied with Californias new legislation banning cooling characterising flavours in tobacco products, this did not result in the market withdrawal of \"non-menthol\" cigarettes. \"Non-menthol\" cigarettes continue to be marketed with package designs resembling those of former menthol cigarettes, signaling the potential presence of a characterising flavour.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

J.; Turnbull, A. G.; Smallwood, J.; Lin, F. V.", "abstract": "Understanding the neural basis of spontaneous thought - when attention shifts from external tasks to internally generated content such as reminiscing or planning - remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. Progress in this area has lagged studies of externally driven cognition, in part because self-generated thought is difficult to control and measure. Recent work suggests that transitions between externally and internally focused cognitive states follow a continuous neural activation gradient that reflects opposing patterns of engagement of the frontoparietal control network versus the default mode network. To characterize internally focused cognitive states that prospectively engage the default mode network, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while participants imagined a range of personal scenarios prompted by generic text cues (e.g., party, housework) to mimic natural thought. Before scanning, participants described each scenario verbally and rated its experiential feature content. Gradient-space analysis revealed a cognitive transition within imagined states: solitary activities (e.g., housework) preferentially recruited the frontoparietal network relative to the default mode network, whereas social activities (e.g., a party) showed the opposite pattern. Because all cognitive states were internally focused (imagined) and elicited via the same non-interactive task, these results refine interpretations of the frontoparietal-default mode gradient. They show that this gradient does not simply differentiate external task-positive from internal task-negative states but also tracks semantic differences between internal cognitive states.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Starting with a global proteomic profiling of the yeast and mouse TDP-43 models, we uncovered that pbp1/ataxin-2 downregulation rewires metabolism to activate alternative cellular pathways for energy production under stress. By combining proteomic profiling insights and functional studies in neural cultures, we further show that ataxin-2 downregulation adjusts metabolism in both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous pathways. In neurons, ataxin-2 downregulation activates glycolysis and reductive glutamine carboxylation, while astrocytes provide enhanced support by increasing cholesterol synthesis.

M.; Wang, J.; Pariyar, R.; Koo, H.; La, J.-H.", "abstract": "Intense nociceptor inputs from injury induce long-term changes in the spinal nociceptive system - referred to as spinal pain memory - that increase pain in magnitude and duration. We investigated whether activation of G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) at the spinal level can erase this memory and resolve long-lasting, enhanced pain using two animal models: the capsaicin model and the hyperalgesic priming model. Without altering normal mechanical and heat nociception, a single intrathecal (i.th.) administration of two GPR37 agonists, TX14A and protectin D1 (PD1), dose-dependently inhibited capsaicin-induced increase in nociception not only acutely but also long-term. In the hyperalgesic priming model, a single i.th. injection of either GPR37 agonist, administered after an initial injury-induced priming, dose-dependently prevented increased nociception following a subsequent inflammatory insult, indicating an unpriming effect. Global GPR37 knockout abolished the long-term inhibitory effect and unpriming effect of i.th. TX14A, confirming the receptor at the spinal level as the molecule mediating the effects. Ex vivo Ca2+ imaging revealed that i.th. TX14A, given in vivo to the capsaicin model a week before imaging, had rescued dorsal horn excitatory and inhibitory interneurons from long-term potentiation and depression of responsiveness to afferent inputs, respectively, suggesting the erasure of capsaicin-induced spinal pain memory. Conditioned place preference tests indicated no obvious abuse liability for centrally-administered GPR37 agonists. These findings suggest that spinally targeted GPR37 agonism represents a promising therapeutic strategy for resolving persistent pain by erasing spinal pain memory.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

This study reveals a critical role for progranulin (PGRN) in regulating vascular senescence, function, and remodeling during aging.\n\nMethodsWe assessed PGRN expression in human and mouse arteries and senescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Functional vascular studies were performed in PGRN-deficient (PGRN-/-) mice. Senescence was modulated pharmacologically using the senolytic agent navitoclax (ABT-263), and vascular phenotype was evaluated in adult (6-month-old) and aged mice (18-month-old).\n\nResultsPGRN expression increased with age in human and mouse arteries, correlating with elevated p21 expression. PGRN deficiency in adult mice induced endothelial dysfunction, increased vasoconstriction, and induced vascular inflammation and remodeling. Transcriptomic analysis of PGRN-/- VSMCs revealed a senescence-associated signature, including perturbed oxidative phosphorylation, altered epigenetic regulation, and collagen pathways. Pharmacological clearance of senescent cells improved endothelial function but increased vascular contractility in PGRN-/- mice. In aged mice, PGRN deficiency aggravated vascular dysfunction, remodeling, and renal injury without further increasing senescence markers--suggesting premature, rather than progressive, senescence in the PGRN-/- mice.\n\nConclusionPGRN is a novel regulator of vascular aging, coordinating senescence, inflammation, and remodeling. While endothelial senescence contributes to dysfunction, VSMCs senescence may serve an adaptive role in modulating vascular tone. Targeting PGRN or senescence pathways may offer therapeutic opportunities for age-related vascular diseases, especially in patients with PGRN mutations associated with frontotemporal dementia.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In the High Arctic, some bird species select nesting sites with physical features that limit the access by their main terrestrial predator, the arctic fox, though these features do not always provide full protection. We investigated how nest microhabitat characteristics and prey availability modulate nest survival in tundra birds that select pond and lake islets as breeding sites. Over four summers, we analyzed the survival of 132 cackling goose and 55 glaucous gull nests located on islets or on pond and lake shores within a 150 km2 area occupied by a snow goose colony on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. We also analyzed survival of 537 artificial nests deployed over three summers. We found that islets act as partial prey refuges, with higher nest survival rates on islets than on pond and lake shores. Nest survival generally increased with islet distance from shore, but we found little evidence of this effect for cackling geese and glaucous gulls, which avoided nesting on islets near shore. Moreover, water depth surrounding islets had little to no influence for any nest type. Nest mortality was much higher in a year with relatively low snow goose nest density, suggesting a short-term positive indirect effect of this colonial nesting bird on species nesting on islets. Since the arctic fox was virtually the sole predator of artificial nests, our findings indicate that annual variation in nest survival on islets were driven by a shift in fox foraging behavior in response to changes in prey availability across the landscape. Our study, which integrates multi-year monitoring and field experiments, highlights the interplay between microhabitat selection and predator-multi-prey dynamics in the arctic tundra.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

A.; You, H.; Tsai, C.-T.; Cui, B.", "abstract": "Inside-out activation of integrins is crucial for transducing mechanical forces through the extracellular ligand-integrin-talin-F-actin axis. Extensive studies have shown that talin is the essential player in this process by binding to the intracellular tail of {beta} integrins. Here, we show that, while talin binding is essential for inside-out integrin activation in focal adhesions, it is dispensable in curved adhesions - a distinct adhesion architecture that is exclusively mediated by integrin v{beta}5 and selectively formed at curved membranes. Instead, a curvature-sensing protein FCHo2 binds to the HDRRE motif in the cytoplasmic tail of integrin {beta}5 (ITG{beta}5) and inside-out activates integrin v{beta}5 in curved adhesions. Intriguingly, FCHo2 does not bind to a similar motif in the homologous integrin {beta}3 tail. Through truncations and mutations, we identified a pivotal tryptophan (W) in the {beta}3 tail, which is conserved in all homologous integrin {beta} isoforms except {beta}5, where it is replaced by a tyrosine (Y766). This tyrosine substitution is crucial for integrin {beta}5s unique capability in forming curved adhesions. A Y766W mutation abolishes integrin {beta}5s capacity to form curved adhesions, without affecting its ability to form focal adhesions. Furthermore, our studies suggest that the phosphorylation state of Y766 regulates whether integrin v{beta}5 forms curved adhesions or focal adhesions, providing a cellular mechanism governing different adhesion types. Overall, our work unveils distinct molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms between curved adhesions and focal adhesions, and establishes a molecular basis for the formation of curved adhesions by integrin v{beta}5.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/691229v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@210414org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@192ee5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e62cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a89906_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examined how binding of aristolochic acid in the intracellular site and cholesterol at the extracellular site, alone or together, affects receptor dynamics and pocket communication. We observed that CLR binding in the extracellular site expanded the intracellular pocket volume and induced conformational changes in TM6, whereas AA binding in the intracellular site had no such effect on the extracellular site. Notably, in cholesterol-only simulations, a chloride ion entered from the intracellular side and interacted with Arginine 55 (BW position 2.50), revealing an inverted ion-binding pattern to Family A GPCRs, where aspartate 2.50 is known to bind a sodium ion to stabilize an inactive state.

Responses to linear acceleration, measured by the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex (tVOR) and vestibular sensory evoked potential (VsEP), were intact with 25% or more hair cell survival in the macula, and diminished only when hair cell survival decreased further.

Despite the growing interest in the role museums can play in pathobiology research and zoonotic risk assessment, there remains a lack of centralized resources for locating tissue samples that may be leveraged for pathogen discovery.

Focusing on tissue samples from the mammalian orders Rodentia and Chiroptera, speciose taxa that host a high diversity of known zoonotic viruses, we examined temporal, spatial, and taxonomic gaps and patterns in the available tissue samples. Our analyses reveal a heavy bias toward tissue samples collected from the Americas (and consequently, taxonomic groups found in the Americas), with most collected samples housed in North American institutions.

While this is undoubtedly a positive development, it increases the need for proper documentation on how the data were collected and what preprocessing was performed on the data, since interpreting analysis results in ignorance of these pieces of information can lead to wrong conclusions. An important preprocessing step is the removal of artifacts from the recordings. Electrophysiological recordings are particularly susceptible to electrical cross-talks between recording channels, resulting in artifact spikes that are coincident in multiple channels on the time scale of the data sampling rate, i.e., 1/30 ms in popular setups. The removal by signal whitening is only possible if also the raw sampled data are available, thus to eliminate this type of artifact is to remove all coincident spikes on the recording time scale to definitely avoid artifact spikes. However, given the lack of the \"ground truth\", this step has the potential to eliminate, in conjunction with the artifacts, components of the data that are pertinent to the research objective. In this study, we use a modified version of the Unitary Event Analysis and demonstrate that such preprocessing results in significantly lower correlations than expected by chance even on longer time scales. We also propose a method to correct for the bias introduced by this preprocessing.

We specifically compared three model training objectives: reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and a vision task, while accounting for other potential factors which may impact performance such as training data and model architecture. We tested models on brain encoding, i.e. their ability to predict functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals acquired while human subjects played different levels of the video game Super Mario Bros. When tested on new playthroughs from the game levels seen at training, the reinforcement learning objective had a small but significant advantage in brain encoding, followed by the imitation learning and vision models. We hypothesized that brain-aligned representations would emerge only in task-competent models, and that the specific brain regions well encoded by a model would depend on the nature of the task it was trained on. While brain encoding did improve during model training, even an untrained model with matching architecture approached the performance of the best models. Contrary to our hypotheses, no model layers or specific training objectives aligned preferentially with specific brain areas. Large performance gaps also persisted in fully trained models across game levels, both those seen during training and entirely novel ones. Overall, even though reinforcement learning presented a small advantage to train brain encoding models for videogame data, all tested brain encoding models exhibited brittle performance with limited generalization both within- and out-of-distribution.

We then qualitatively compared these simulated dynamics with empirical EEG data from a perceptual decision-making task involving voluntary and instructed skip actions. Across both datasets, self-initiated actions showed a gradual buildup of activity, marked reductions in cross-trial variability, sharper state transitions, and beta-gamma frequency shifts; in contrast, externally triggered actions exhibited minimal variability reduction, weaker transitions, and largely stable frequency content. These convergent results suggest that self-initiated actions are supported by distinct preparatory dynamics, characterized by internal competition and stabilization of neural states, whereas externally triggered actions rely primarily on externally driven input. Together, these findings identify candidate neurodynamic signatures of intention formation and highlight how simplified computational models can reproduce and help explain key features of volitional control observed in human electrophysiology.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Patients with LS exhibit a range of neurological symptoms, including neurodevelopmental delays, hypotonia, febrile seizures, and behavioural abnormalities; however, the cellular and developmental origins of LS remain poorly understood. The Drosophila genome encodes a single homolog of OCRL (docrl). Here, we report that a germline null allele of docrl (docrlKO) shows heat induced seizures reminiscent of the febrile seizures in LS patients. Cell type specific deletion of docrl in neurons was sufficient to recapitulate the heat induced seizures seen in docrlKO indicating a cell autonomous requirement of docrl in neurons to prevent seizures. Temporally controlled deletion of docrl showed that heat induced seizure in adults were predetermined by a requirement of docrl in neural stem cells during embryonic neurogenesis.

This study investigated the effects of a short-term, intermittent KD on neurobehavioral function, lipid metabolism, immune response, and gut microbiota composition in sham-operated (intact) and ovariectomized (OVX, estrogen-deficient) female mice, aiming to delineate the interactions between diet and gonadal hormones. In sham females, KD reduced circulating estradiol levels and induced low-grade systemic inflammation, without producing measurable behavioral benefits. Conversely, KD exhibited reduced compulsivity, anxiety, and depression-like behaviors with improved well-being in OVX females, suggesting enhanced neurobehavioral resilience under estrogen-deficient conditions. Biochemical analyses revealed KD-induced hyperlipidemia in both groups, although the lipid load was attenuated in OVX mice. KD further decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but led to uremia and histopathological evidence of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in OVX females, despite unaltered liver function markers. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed hormone-dependent remodelling of the gut microbiota, characterised by distinct compositional shifts between the sham and OVX cohorts. Correlation analyses linked microbial alterations to improved lipid profiles and reduced anxiodepressive behaviors, implicating the gut-metabolic-brain axis in mediating the effects of KD. Collectively, these findings suggest that KD confers neurobehavioral and metabolic benefits in the absence of ovarian hormones but may also pose risks to the liver and kidneys. These results highlight ketogenic nutrition as a potential non-pharmacological strategy to mitigate menopause- and aging-associated neurobehavioral, metabolic, and immune dysfunctions through modulation of the gut microbiota.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

The role of pitp-1 in promoting healthy longevity remains unknown. Our previous work showed that the phosphoinositide turnover genes dagl-1 and dgk-5 regulates lifespan, as overexpression of dagl-1 or knockdown of dgk-5 prolongs lifespan and enhances oxidative stress resistance through TOR signaling. As pitp-1 is a key component of this pathway, we investigated its role in lifespan regulation and the underlying mechanisms, aiming to clarify whether it represents a critical regulator of healthy longevity and how it coordinates conserved signaling pathways to regulate aging. Methods C. elegans mutants, RNAi-mediated knockdown, and transgenic overexpression were applied to assess lifespan, motility, stress resistance. Temporal and tissue-specific RNAi were applied to identify the critical time window and tissue for pitp-1-mediated lifespan regulation. TOR signaling was measured by phosphorylated S6 kinase and puromycin incorporation, and transcriptomic analysis identified affected pathways. Results pitp-1 negatively regulates lifespan and healthspan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Genetic deletion or RNAi-mediated knockdown of pitp-1 extends lifespan, attenuates age-related motility decline, and increases oxidative stress resistance. Temporal and spatial analyses reveal that suppression of pitp-1 in neurons during early adulthood is sufficient to promote healthy longevity. Mechanistically, these beneficial effects upon pitp-1 reduction are mediated by suppressing TOR signaling. Conversely, pitp-1 overexpression shortens lifespan and impairs healthspan via TOR activation. Moreover, pitp-1 is transcriptionally repressed by DAF-16 downstream of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS), and contributes to IIS-mediated lifespan extension. Conclusion These findings identify pitp-1 as a novel regulator of healthy aging that integrates IIS and TOR pathways, providing new insights into conserved mechanisms for promoting healthy longevity.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

We investigated whether introducing sialic acid residues to scFv8D3 through engineered fragment antigen-binding (Fab) glycosylation could reduce ADA formation. We generated two novel variants with distinct N-linked glycosylation motifs (NXT/S), which both displayed sialic acid residues and retained functionality, as evidenced by the preservation of transferrin receptor binding and brain uptake. However, Fab glycosylation did not significantly alter pharmacokinetics or ADA production in mice.

While recent observational research has begun to document associations between canine maternal behaviour and later offspring outcomes, there is still much to learn--particularly regarding what factors impact maternal behaviour and the enduring effects of maternal care on puppy behavioural development. Understanding how early experiences shape future behaviour is of practical importance for companion and working dogs. We characterized the early rearing environment of 235 individual puppies from 59 litters bred by a service dog provider and explored whether offspring cognitive and behavioural traits through 16 months of age were associated with early mothering behaviour. We also investigated whether maternal behaviour could be predicted by pre-pregnancy dam behaviour and how the rearing location (private home or professional breeding centre) influenced maternal behaviour and/or puppy behaviour. We identified dam behavioural characteristics measured pre-pregnancy that were related to subsequent maternal care. While time of year was associated with maternal behaviour scores, parity, litter size, breed composition, and rearing location were not. We found that rearing location was related to puppy performance on the Dog Cognitive Development Battery (DCDB) at 8 weeks of age. Finally, maternal behaviour was associated with certain puppy cognitive and behavioural measures, assessed via the DCDB at 8 weeks of age and via questionnaires at 6, 10, 12 and 16 months of age. Our results indicate that experiences within the first few weeks of life, particularly maternal care and rearing location, may influence several aspects of dog behaviour relevant to both working and companion animals.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

The ECM typically has fluid-like, viscoelastic properties that can be quantified rheologically. Here, we determine that the viscoelasticity of a polysaccharide alginate ECM regulates the assembly of type I collagen fibers. The viscoelasticity and shear moduli of the alginate network were tuned by the polymer weight percentage and degree of cooperative ionic and covalent norbornene-tetrazine crosslinking. Stepwise shear strain applied to covalently-crosslinked hydrogels generated higher stress than in ionic hydrogels. Hydrogels with reduced viscoelasticity also showed a reduction in water permeability. Second-harmonic generation confocal imaging revealed that decreasing viscoelasticity significantly suppressed collagen fiber self-assembly. Simulations demonstrated a mechanical coupling of the hydrogel network and the aggregate size of collagen molecules. Increased covalent crosslinking impaired the rate and magnitude of self-assembly in simulations and experimental results. These results suggest that ECM viscoelasticity plays a role in modulating the assembly and structural organization of collagen within the matrix. More broadly, they provide a framework for understanding how ECM mechanical properties can influence the assembly and organization of fibrillar macromolecules.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Abstractions such as domains and active sites enable quantitative descriptions of how protein features act biologically. Thanks to the abundance of high-quality sequence and function data, machine learning has achieved great success in directly predicting protein function. However, translating functional characterizations into mechanistic ones on the level of the domains, binding sites, or motifs remains challenging. This represents a semi-supervised problem: sequences and global functional labels are available, but local annotations must be inferred. Results: We investigate the unsupervised discovery of functionally active protein regions by integrating protein sequence models with functional information. We first formalize the residue-level functional annotation problem by constructing unified evaluation datasets linking Gene Ontology functions to annotated residues. Eight datasets are assembled, spanning levels of specificity from single active-site residues to domains covering up to 60% of a protein. We then introduce a new class of function-conditioned generative models that more accurately predict functionally important residues than existing approaches, including interpretability methods and PSSM entropy estimation, across multiple benchmark datasets.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

The simulations, in which DNA is represented as bead-spring polymers and Dps as spherical particles, reveal that weak Dps:DNA attraction and low Dps concentrations produce extended, network-like morphologies, whereas stronger interactions and higher Dps concentrations drive compaction into dense globular condensates with suppressed DNA mobility and sub-diffusive dynamics.

The failure may reflect limited screening sensitivity, or disease onset after infancy among aggressive tumors. Here, we used an epigenetic mitotic clock based on fluctuating CpG DNA methylation to estimate patient-specific tumor mitotic ages and calendar ages in a cohort of unscreened children diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Aggressive cancers (stage 4) primarily started growing after the first year of life, making them undetectable by screening during infancy. In contrast, biologically indolent tumors (stages 1, 2, 3 and 4S) often started growing in utero or during the first year of life, and affected children had better survival outcomes. Due to a short preclinical detectable phase of aggressive neuroblastomas, reducing mortality through screening is impractical as it would require frequent screening among older children.

A. A.; Luo, H.", "abstract": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) arises from coupled interactions between blood flow, tissue mechanics, and cellular signaling. Hemodynamic forces influence endothelial and interstitial cell behavior, while the resulting tissue remodeling alters valve motion and flow patterns. Capturing this two-way feedback requires models that integrate fluid-structure mechanics with biochemical regulation, yet such multiscale coupling remains technically challenging. Previous computational models have focused on isolated aspects of the disease: fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations reproduce valve deformation and flow, and systems biology (SB) models describe molecular signaling that drives fibrosis and calcification. However, without coupling, these approaches cannot predict how mechanical dysfunction initiates biochemical remodeling or how biochemical changes feed back on mechanics. Here, we present a multi-physics computational framework that couples three-dimensional FSI simulations of aortic valve dynamics with a mechanistic SB model of calcification signaling. The FSI module resolves pulsatile blood flow and leaflet deformation, yielding local wall shear stresses and tissue strains throughout the cardiac cycle. These mechanical quantities are used as inputs to the SB module, which represents key biochemical pathways governing inflammation, TGF-{beta}/SMAD signaling, and nitric-oxide (NO)--mediated inhibition within valvular cells. Simulations predict long-term calcification trajectories for valves of varying thickness, showing that fibrosis-induced stiffening lowers shear stress, reduces NO synthesis, and enhances TGF-{beta} activation, thereby accelerating calcification. The framework is modular and extensible, allowing future incorporation of additional pathways, as well as implementation of full two-way coupling between the FSI and SB models. By integrating physics-based hemodynamics with systems-level biochemistry, this study provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of a next-generation, multi-scale modeling platform for studying cardiovascular disease that unites blood flow dynamics and biochemical signaling.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Given the fundamental role of this protein in vesicular exocytosis, most electrophysiological studies have focused on the impact of this haploinsufficiency on synaptic transmission, and much less on intrinsic neuronal properties. Furthermore, the possibility that the electrophysiological consequences may be dependent on the developmental stage has not yet been investigated. Here, we analyze using acute brain slices from neonatal and juvenile STXBP1 heterozygous mice the intrinsic properties as well as spontaneous and evoked glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in pyramidal cells located in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in layers II/III of the motor cortex. We show that Munc18.1 deficiency has different electrophysiological consequences in neonatal (postnatal days, PND 4-7) and juvenile mice (PND30-35). The deficit of Munc18.1 leads to an increase in the intrinsic excitability of hippocampal and motor cortical pyramidal cells in neonates while in juveniles, it is evoked synaptic transmission that is affected, with a greater sensitivity of glutamatergic synapses than of GABAergic synapses in response to high-frequency electrical stimulation. However spontaneous ongoing synaptic activity mediated by glutamate and GABA receptors was unaffected at both stages of development. In addition, we performed western blot analysis and observed that Munc18.1 deficiency in STXBP1 heterozygous mice is associated with decreased t-SNARE proteins expression levels in the hippocampus and neocortex of juvenile but not neonatal mice. Therefore, Munc18.1 deficiency has multiple electrophysiological and biochemical consequences, which depend on the developmental stage.

Using combined stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and sleep recordings from 17 patients, alongside targeted auditory stimulation to induce arousals during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, we directly assessed how transient sleep disruption influences the occurrence and spatial propagation of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and examined key factors that modulate this relationship. We demonstrate that arousals acutely increase IED counts, with this effect being dependent on anatomical brain region, seizure-onset zone (SOZ) involvement, and sleep stage. Transient arousal-driven increases in IEDs were observed in neocortical regions, outside the SOZ and during NREM stage 2 sleep (N2), reflecting both regional and network-level specificity. Despite increasing IED counts, arousals did not influence IED propagation, indicating that sleep fragmentation selectively enhances local cortical excitability without engaging broader epileptic networks.

Although its role in ischemic stroke remains unclear, we hypothesized that cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) would upregulate B7-H3 expression in the ischemic brain and that increased B7-H3 expression would positively correlate with pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Young and aged male and female rodents, including normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats to model comorbid hypertension, underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. Brain tissue was collected on post-ischemic days 1, 3, 5, or 7. B7-H3 mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR, whereas protein expression was assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry at selected time points. B7-H3 expression was significantly upregulated in the ischemic brain across sexes, age groups, and species. The extent of B7-H3 degradation in the ischemic brain was influenced by species, sex, age, and time after cerebral I/R. Upregulation of B7-H3 was observed at both the mRNA and protein levels, and increased expression was localized primarily to the somatosensory cortex and caudate putamen in the ipsilateral hemisphere, the main regions affected in this MCAO model. Elevated B7-H3 expression in the ischemic brain positively correlated with the pro-inflammatory mediator TNF. The temporal profile of B7-H3 expression observed in rats paralleled the early inflammatory phase associated with secondary tissue damage following ischemic stroke.

Oxidation-specific epitopes (OSEs) form on oxidized lipids and proteins, are abundant in lungs of patients with fILD and perpetuate lung injury and fibrosis in animal models. OSE-targeting antibodies bind to OSEs and modulate their downstream effects. The objective of this study was to determine the association of OSE-targeting antibodies with lung function and other clinical outcomes, and to characterize OSE-specific B cell phenotypes in fILD. Methods: To determine the association of OSE-targeting antibodies and clinical outcomes in fILD, we measured serum levels of OSE-specific antibodies against the malondialdehyde modified LDL mimotope P1 and anti-ApoB100 immune complex (anti-ApoB100 IC) in patients with fILD and age-matched controls. We then performed B cell phenotyping of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and healthy controls utilizing mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF). To investigate effects of pro-fibrotic mediators on anti-OSE IgA antibody production, we measured B cell responses to OSEs in vitro. Results: Cohort of 109 patients with fILD (Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia, Connective Tissue Disease-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease) and 55 healthy donors, and a second cohort of 20 patients with IPF and 9 healthy donors were included in the study. OSE-specific antibody levels anti-P1 and anti-ApoB100 IC IgA and IgG were significantly elevated in participants with fILD compared to healthy donors (p<0.0001). Higher anti-OSE IgA was associated with worse baseline lung function, including forced vital capacity (FVC) (p<0.001) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (p<0.01). IgA+CD27-CD21-CD11c+ double negative type 2 (DN2) B cells correlated with anti-OSE IgA levels (p<0.05) and were enriched in OSE-specific cells. DN2 B cell precursors, CXCR5-CD11c+ naive B cells and IgA+CD27-CD21-CD11c- DN3 B cells, were significantly expanded in IPF compared to healthy donors. Both DN2 and DN3 B cells correlated with plasmablast pools in IPF patients and showed high baseline levels of IL-21 receptor, which was reduced in more differentiated cells. TGF-beta combined with OSEs, but not OSEs alone, induced OSE-specific IgA production in vitro. Conclusions: Serum anti-OSE IgA antibodies are elevated in patients with fibrotic ILDs regardless of underlying pathology and negatively correlate with lung function. These antibodies correlated with the DN2 B cell subset which was enriched in OSE-specific cells. Phenotypic analysis of B cell subsets showed expression of markers consistent with DN to plasmablast differentiation. Finally, TGF-beta promoted OSE-IgA production in vitro. These findings show a novel link between oxidative tissue damage, anti-OSE antibodies and DN2 B cells in fILD which may provide opportunities for new targeted therapies.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Unlike mammalian lungs, externally located zebrafish gills are readily accessible for high-resolution optical imaging and experimental manipulation, suggesting zebrafish might provide an excellent comparative vertebrate model for studying the development and function of gas-exchange organs and the gas-exchange blood vasculature. To characterize their resident cell populations, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on adult zebrafish gills, revealing numerous cell types with transcriptional similarities to those found in mammalian lungs. We uncovered and characterized several different endothelial cell populations, including distinct clusters of arterial endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells. The largest endothelial cell cluster closely resembles Cap2 or \"Aerocyte\" endothelial cells, a recently discovered unusual mammalian endothelial cell type found exclusively in lung alveoli. Zebrafish aerocytes localize to the analogous gas-exchange structures in fish, the highly vascularized gill lamellae. We use confocal and super-resolution imaging of transgenic and hybridization chain reaction-probed zebrafish, array tomography, and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy to carry out a detailed and comprehensive characterization of gill aerocytes including 3-D ultrastructural reconstruction of one of these cells, showing that as in mammals these cells are closely associated with gas-exchange epithelia and that they possess unique properties that may help facilitate their gas-exchange function. Together, our findings help establish a new, experimentally accessible comparative vertebrate model for studying the gas-exchange blood vasculature.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In this study, potential roles of the Peg3 imprinted domain in mammalian reproduction were analyzed with the mutant mouse model lacking the oocyte-specific alternative promoter U1, which exhibits the abnormal biallelic expression or 2x gene dosage of Peg3. According to the results, the pregnant females displayed several mutant phenotypes related to reproduction, including delayed parturition, and defects in placentophagy and nest-building behaviors, causing subsequent neonatal lethality. These phenotypes were observed from the homozygote females delivering the entire litter with 2x Peg3, but not from the heterozygotes producing a half of litter with 2x Peg3, suggesting the presence of maximal tolerable gene dosage of Peg3 for healthy pregnancy as well as potential fetal influence on maternal pregnancy through the gene dosage of the Peg3 domain. Detailed analyses also revealed partial embryonic lethality among the female with 2x Peg3, suggesting the susceptibility of the female to the elevated gene dosage of Peg3. Overall, this highlights that the gene dosage of the Peg3 domain is critical for the successful mammalian reproduction.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined the mechanisms by which CBD regulates HLA expression in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells, focusing on cannabinoid-related receptors and intracellular Ca++ signaling. CBD increased the expression of classical HLA class I genes, most notably HLA-C, while reducing HLA-G levels, a non-classical HLA class I molecule that acts as a local immunosuppressor. Receptor profiling revealed constitutive expression of CB1 and CB2, whereas GPR55 and PPAR{gamma} expression became detectable only after CBD exposure. Functional inhibition assays showed that HLA-G downregulation was selectively attenuated by CB1 blockade, with no meaningful contribution from CB2 or GPR55. In contrast, CBD-induced HLA-C upregulation required GPR55 and CB2 activity, while being unaffected by CB1 inhibition, indicating distinct receptor pathways for classical and non-classical HLA regulation. Calcium chelation using BAPTA further demonstrated that HLA-G modulation is highly sensitive to intracellular Ca++ reduction, whereas classical HLA expression required higher BAPTA concentrations to be affected. Altogether, these findings identify CBD as a dual immunomodulatory agent capable of enhancing tumor immune visibility while limiting immunotolerant HLA-G expression through receptor-specific and Ca++-dependent mechanisms.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

The miR-424(322)~503 cluster, comprising miR-424 and miR-503, has been implicated in various malignancies, exhibiting dual roles as tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the context. However, its function in CRC remains poorly understood. This study investigates the role of the miR-424(322)~503 cluster in CRC driven by PTEN deficiency using genetically modified mouse models. Our findings reveal that the loss of miR-424(322)~503 significantly exacerbates CRC progression in PTEN-deficient mice. Double knockout (dKO) mice lacking both PTEN and miR-424(322)~503 exhibited a higher number and larger size of colorectal lesions compared to PTEN-deficient counterparts. Histological analysis demonstrated increased severity of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma development in dKO mice. Mechanistically, while Wnt/[beta]-catenin signaling remained unaltered, transcriptomic analyses highlighted dysregulation of MAPK and TGF[beta] pathways, alongside epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related gene signatures. Protein-level validation confirmed hyperactivation of MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38) and TGF[beta] signaling, as well as elevated cyclin D1 expression in dKO colonic tissues. These results underscore the tumor-suppressive role of the miR-424(322)~503 cluster in CRC by modulating key oncogenic pathways such as MAPK and TGF[beta].

While these inputs can promote crop growth, they also contain persistent contaminants like PFAS, which may affect plants directly or indirectly via changes to plant-associated microbiomes. The extent and mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood, particularly across crops with differing functional traits. We conducted two greenhouse experiments to evaluate the direct and microbially mediated effects of biosolid and reclaimed water amendments spiked with increasing contaminant concentrations on lettuce (Lactuca sativa), radish (Raphanus sativus), and green pea (Pisum sativum). Peas exhibited pronounced negative responses to biosolids, including reduced germination, survival, and biomass, which scaled with contaminant concentration and coincided with visible pathogen infection. Lettuce and radish showed minimal impact, suggesting that plant functional traits, such as symbiotic capacity and nutrient-dependent immune regulation, may mediate susceptibility to contaminant-induced stress. Soil microbiome diversity and composition were altered in a crop- and amendment-specific manner, but microbiomes shaped by prior exposure had limited effects on pea performance when transferred to new plants in the absence of ongoing stressors. These findings suggest that current soil conditions and active plant-microbiome interactions may outweigh legacy microbiome effects. Overall, our study provides a novel framework for evaluating the risks and benefits of wastewater-derived amendments, emphasizing the importance of functional trait variation in predicting plant responses to contaminants and guiding sustainable agricultural practices.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Previous in vitro studies have suggested a distributive mode of action based largely on qualitative inspection of mass spectrometry data rather than quantitative analysis. Here, we use mathematical modeling of CTD phosphorylation to explore whether local context, such as neighboring phosphorylations or directional biases, affects P-TEFb activity on the CTD. Our results indicate that P-TEFb acts distributively but with pronounced local cooperativity: repeats adjacent to phosphorylated sites are modified at higher rates. We find no evidence for directional bias, although the limited positional resolution of the data precludes a definitive conclusion. These results identify local context as an important factor in P-TEFb-mediated CTD phosphorylation and establish a quantitative modeling framework for dissecting multi-site modification dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Through stage-specific behavioral assays, optogenetics, in vivo brain imaging, and fluorescent neuronal tracking, we identify a subset of ventral nervous system (VNS) DANs that modulate locomotor function throughout life. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that they maintain expression of developmental transcription factors. Knocking down these factors in post-mitotic VNS DANs impairs adult locomotion.

A.; D'Souza, A.; Ansari Mahabadian, A.; Calamante, F.; Piguet, O.", "abstract": "The hippocampus plays a central role in episodic memory and has been the focus of extensive research over past decades. A substantial body of work has demonstrated that age-related memory decline is linked to changes in how the hippocampus functionally interacts with distributed brain networks. While functional connectivity changes in ageing are well documented, relatively little is known about alterations in the structural connectivity (SC) of the hippocampus, despite its foundational role in supporting communication across neural systems. In this study, we combined high-quality data from the Human Connectome Project and advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods to investigate age-related changes in hippocampal SC. Using a recently developed tractography pipeline that allows greater anatomical specificity than conventional approaches, we systematically compared connectivity patterns between younger (26-30 years) and older (56-60 years) adults. Results revealed reduced hippocampal SC with the entorhinal cortex and medial parietal cortices in older participants, alongside increased SC with anterior temporal areas. This paradoxical pattern suggests that ageing is associated with both vulnerability and reorganisation of hippocampal networks, with increased hippocampal-temporal connectivity potentially reflecting compensatory plasticity in response to reduced posterior medial connection. These findings provide in vivo evidence of cortico-hippocampal structural reorganisation in late middle age, a critical period when pathological processes such as tau deposition are already detectable in cognitively healthy individuals. More broadly, they demonstrate the power of our anatomically refined tractography pipeline as a proof of concept for detecting subtle, regionally specific changes in hippocampal pathway density.

To answer this question, we analyzed associative olfactory learning and memory in Drosophila larvae of both sexes with the isoform-specific dunceD143 mutation. Flies with this mutation exhibited better learning than flies with the dunce1 mutant. The memory facilitated by dunceD143 was stable and easily reversable. The improvement in memory was also traced to a defined subset of neurons. A comparison of the subcellular localization of Dunce isoforms indicates that the regulation of cAMP in the soma suppresses early memory formation. We revealed that Dunce regulates at least two different aspects of learning and memory, specifically, preventing the premature formation of memory and facilitating the formation of memory after multiple training sessions. The different functions of Dunce might be due to different cell types.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Attentional network efficiency was assessed through event-related potentials (ERPs), midfrontal theta power as an index of conflict processing, and weighted Symbolic Mutual Information (wSMI) to quantify large-scale, nonlinear information sharing. Higher full-scale IQ scores were specifically associated with reduced wSMI within the orienting network, suggesting greater neural efficiency through less widespread information exchange between dorsal frontoparietal nodes. No significant associations were found between IQ and theta-band power during conflict processing.

The fate of a glycoprotein is tied to its N-glycan(s) structure, which serves as a ''molecular barcode'' for quality control. In particular, modulation of ERQC/ERAD can increase leakage of responsive (i.e., non-inactive) glycoprotein mutants that remain misfolded yet retain biological activity once outside the ER. Rescue of secretion of such mutants is a promising therapeutic strategy for the therapy of congenital rare disease due to a missense mutation in a secreted glycoprotein gene, but the relative merits of UGGT vs. EDEM inhibition to release a mutant from the ER remain to be explored. An ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework (''ER Glycoprotein Outcome'', ERGO) evaluates time-dependent ER concentrations of 13 N-glycospecies of a single mutant glycoprotein (G1M9, G1M8B, G1M8C, G1M7BC, M9, M8A, M8B, M8C, M7AB, M7AC, M7BC, M6, M5) within the ER lumen, under a set of chosen hypotheses. All reactions follow mass-action kinetics with ER enzymes/lectins kinetic constants and concentrations as fixed parameters. The ODE system is solved in Python with adaptive Runge-Kutta integration. Simulations initialise from a single glycoform (M9, 1M) and track glycoform distributions over about 28 h. Starting glycoform concentrations and overall time can be customised. Given the lack of comprehensive kinetic data in the literature, parameter values reflect educated guesses, rather than measured constants. Four simulation scenarios explore the dynamics of ERQC vs ERAD: (A) baseline scenario with all enzymes active; (B) UGGT inhibition, which abolishes re-glucosylation, disrupts CNX/CRT cycles, and accelerates substrate flux toward ERAD-prone glycoforms; (C) inhibition of all ER mannosidases, preventing trimming-dependent ERAD commitment and prolonging ER retention of early glycoforms; (D) combined UGGT and ER mannosidases inhibition, mimicking experimental rescue of misfolded substrates by blockade of both glucosylation-driven ER retention and trimming-driven degradation signals.

Traditionally, the HIV-1 capsid core geometry is represented as a fullerene lattice, akin to the icosahedral models of spherical viruses in Caspar-Klug theory. However, recent studies revealed that many viral capsids deviate from such idealised lattices, with important functional implication. Here we demonstrate that this is the case also for the conical HIV-1 core geometries, in which the hexamer and pentamer boundaries form a pseudo-tiling rather than a perfectly aligned fullerene network. We introduce a triangular geometric criterion that quantifies local deviations of an HIV-1 atomic model from its idealised fullerene backbone. Using this criterion, we demonstrate that this difference in geometric organisation between idealised (fullerene) and actual (data-derived) capsid model has implications for the capsid's biophysical properties.

There are suggestions of condensates formed by different proteins being in the vicinity of thermodynamic critical points. To enable quantitative adjudication of near- versus off-critical phase behaviors, we analyzed results from large-scale simulations of an archetypal PLCD that undergoes phase separation coupled to percolation. Mapping of critical points required the use of finite-size scaling and computation of Binder cumulants. We find that the binodal can be demarcated into three distinct regimes. Regime I is farthest from the critical point, with the dilute phase being akin to a gas of dispersed polymers. Regime II lies above the intersection of the overlap line and the dilute arm of the binodal. Here, dilute phases are characterized by heterogeneous cluster-size distributions with heavy tails. In Regimes I and II, dense phases are confined percolated networks. Regime III is closest to the critical point. Here, the dense phase becomes unconfined and the percolated network swells to become system-spanning. In Regime III, the dilute phase also forms a percolated, system-spanning network. Thus, Regime III comprises two interconnected, system-spanning networks. Strikingly, across the entire temperature range, conformational distributions of individual chains within dense and dilute phases closely follow Gaussian chain statistics. Changes to sequence-encoded interactions change critical temperatures and the locations of different regimes.

Unlike orthosteric inhibitors, they preferentially stabilize EGFR in an inactive conformation. Hence, understanding the mechanistic basis of this inhibition is essential for designing potent allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we performed microsecond-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the inactive conformations of apo-EGFR and apo-EGFRL858R/T790M to explore how cancer-associated mutations induce a conformational switch toward the active kinase state. Simulations of allosteric inhibitor (EAI001) bound EGFRL858R/T790M revealed that inhibitor binding enhances the inactive state population by disrupting the K745-E762 salt bridge and modulating key structural elements. These findings revealed the structural basis of allosteric inhibition in EGFRL858R/T790M. It also emphasized the importance of MD simulations in allosteric drug design for assessing the ability of the inhibitor to enhance the population of the inactive state of the mutant EGFR. We have also standardized a virtual screening protocol involving screening of an allosteric TKI library by docking, re-ranking them with a machine learning-based scoring function (SG-ML-PLAP), and evaluating top-scoring molecules by MD and MM/GBSA to identify molecules stabilizing the inactive state of the EGFRL858R/T790M.

Glycosylation of neurotrophin receptors has been reported to affect their localization and function. To investigate the effects of glycosylation of the extracellular domains (ECDs) of p75, TrkA, and TrkB neurotrophin receptors, we modeled their ECDs in glycosylated and non-glycosylated states and carried out molecular dynamics simulations of monomeric and dimeric forms of the ECDs with and without a neurotrophin bound. The single N-glycan on the p75 ECD provided minimal shielding and had limited interaction with the neurotrophin, although glycan-glycan contacts between the two p75 monomers may influence the stability of the receptor-neurotrophin complex. In contrast, TrkA and TrkB carry multiple N-glycans that shield the ECDs much more and, particularly for TrkB, increase the contact area between the receptor and the neurotrophin. The p75 ECD was comparatively rigid, independent of glycosylation state, likely due to its extensive network of disulfide bonds. In contrast, without glycans, the TrkA and TrkB ECDs tended to collapse inwards, sometimes obstructing the neurotrophin binding site. Glycosylation of TrkA and TrkB prevented bending of the ECD into more compact states, and instead promoted extended conformations that better accommodate neurotrophin binding. Overall, the simulations reveal distinct, receptor-specific roles of glycosylation in modulating neurotrophin receptor shielding, flexibility, and conformation, with effects on neurotrophin binding.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Here we test the hypothesis that because the thermodynamic stability of a protein ({Delta}G H2O) determines the probability of conformational transitions, the apparent pKa values of buried residues can be governed by {Delta}G H2O. Variants of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) with either Lys-66 or Lys-92 buried in its hydrophobic interior were engineered along with surface mutations that alter {Delta}G H2O without affecting the electrostatic properties of the internal microenvironments of the buried Lys residues. The measured pKa values of these Lys residues largely correlates with {Delta}G H2O. NMR spectroscopy was used to demonstrate that the structural changes of the protein backbone coupled to the ionization of Lys-66 or Lys-92 are comparable regardless of the {Delta}G H2O of the protein. NMR spectroscopy confirmed that global unfolding of the Lys-92 variant coincides with the apparent pKa of the Lys side chain. The data presented show that the anomalous pKa values measured for internal residues in proteins do not necessarily report on local dielectric or electrostatic properties of the microenvironments around the ionizable group; rather, they can report on the energetics of pH-driven conformational transitions.

Cardiac neuromodulation including vagus nerve stimulation have emerged as alternative therapies by restoring sympatho-vagal balance. In this work, a medulla stimulation strategy was developed to precisely regulate the heart rate. The stimulation parameters effecting on cardiac function were assessed in open-loop experiments. The cardiac effects of rostral and caudal medulla stimulation were enhanced with increased stimulus frequency. We further investigated whether medulla stimulation can temporarily regulate the heart rate at predetermined levels using on-off closed-loop control. Additionally, we tested the capacity of medullary stimulation to rebalance autonomic function under peripheral imbalance conditions caused by dobutamine and neostigmine administration. The performance of heart rate regulation was quantified by the control degree and root mean squared error. The results demonstrate the feasibility of medulla stimulation for regulating sympathetic activity, emphasizing its potential therapeutic use in cardiac disorders.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Using human melanoma, breast, and lung tumors, we map both discrete and continuous cell-cycle states across entire tissue sections to reveal how proliferative activity is spatially structured within the TME. We find that cycling and non-cycling cells form distinct spatial niches reflecting differences in vascularization, immune composition, and cellular density. Continuous-phase inference further exposes tumor-specific variations in cell cycle phase durations and uncovers oscillatory programs. Together, our results provide a spatiotemporal view of cell-cycle organization in human tumors and establish a general framework for detecting dynamic transcriptional programs and spatial proliferation patterns from static tissue data.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

T.; Leunissen, I.", "abstract": "Phase-dependent modulation of motor inhibition suggests that oscillatory timing plays a key role in inhibitory control. Here we show that rhythmic brain stimulation can selectively alter this timing in a manner consistent with phase precession. Participants performed an anticipatory stop-signal task while receiving 20 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the pre-supplementary motor area, with stop signals presented at defined phases of the stimulation waveform. An additional control experiment with no tACS was conducted, in which the stop signal phase was derived post-hoc from the ongoing EEG. In both tACS and control sessions, stopping efficacy varied sinusoidally with beta phase, confirming that inhibitory control is intrinsically phase-dependent. During tACS, however, the phase associated with the strongest inhibition advanced progressively across the session by about 180 degrees, and this effect was specific to failed-stop trials. No comparable shift occurred without stimulation. These findings indicate that rhythmic drive can bias the temporal phase at which inhibition is most effective when the brain is in an error-prone state, revealing a state-dependent, precession-like reorganization of inhibitory timing. We propose that tACS interacts with error-related plasticity to promote gradual phase advancement, placing the system within spike-timing-dependent learning windows, whereas intrinsic fluctuations alone appear insufficient to facilitate cumulative precession. More broadly, these results suggest that phase precession may represent a general coding principle extending beyond hippocampal circuits, enabling the motor system to adaptively adjust inhibitory control through oscillatory timing mechanisms.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Activated HSCs drive a program of tissue residence in activated, tissue-infiltrating CD8+ T-cells in a TGF-beta-dependent manner. We show upregulation of CD103, ECM-binding integrins and adhesion molecules driven by TGF-beta; which together contribute to the sequestration of TRM within the ECM-rich fibrotic niche. Ex vivo, hepatic CD103+ TRM correlate with the extent of ECM deposited, express an altered repertoire of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptors, transcriptional regulators of cellular exhaustion and produce less proinflammatory mediators upon TCR engagement in CLD than in health. Through expression of several co-inhibitory ligands, we further demonstrate the potential for activated HSCs to acquire an immunomodulatory phenotype and limit the capacity of CD103+ TRM to produce anti-viral and anti-tumour mediators upon antigen encounter. Finally, we demonstrate that strategies to block such regulatory pathways, including the PD1:PD-L1/PD-L2 axis, have the potential to restore the antigen-specific effector function of tissue-compartmentalised CD103+ TRM and thus contribute to improving the effectiveness of local immunosurveillance in CLD.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Developing novel covalent strategies beyond C797 targeting presents a compelling opportunity for next-generation EGFR inhibitors.

To further enhance resilience to resistance-causing mutations, we developed a dual-warhead, bident compound-YNW-1-which covalently targets both cysteine 775 and 797 simultaneously. YNW-1 is the first intramolecular lock to exhibit balanced reactive efficiency on both cysteines, rendering single-site mutations ineffective to confer resistance.

Despite their ecological dominance in riverine ecosystems, phylogenetic relationships among mainland Chinese Rhinogobius species remain poorly resolved due to limited sampling and morphological conservatism, particularly in meristic traits traditionally used for classification. To address these knowledge gaps, we employed a nuclear gene enrichment approach to target 4,434 single-copy nuclear loci across 26 species spanning all major river basins in eastern and southern China. Our phylogenomic analyses based on sequence of 2,137 cleaned-up loci (477,822 bp) recovered a robust topology dividing Rhinogobius into three primary lineages: an early-diverging of R. similis sister to two major clades, the northern vs. southern clades exhibiting strong geographic structuring. Fossil-calibrated molecular dating placed the crown age of Rhinogobius at ~9.33 million years ago (Ma) during the late Miocene, with a pivotal north-south divergence at ~5.96 Ma coinciding with major paleo-drainage reorganizations in East Asia. Ancestral state reconstruction revealed that the southern clade uniquely evolved unstable first dorsal fin formula and near-universal presence of predorsal scales. By integrating the most extensive geographic and taxonomic sampling to date with phylogenomic data, this study establishes: (1) a revised evolutionary timeline for Rhinogobius diversification linked to East Asian geomorphological history, (2) diagnostic morphological characters for major clades, and (3) a robust phylogenetic framework to guide future taxonomic revisions and conservation efforts for this ecologically significant group.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

While alterations in cognitive control have been consistently observed in a range of psychiatric disorders, the neural mechanisms giving rise to this behavioral variation remain elusive. Here, we tested whether the ability to flexibly recruit recurring brain activation patterns (i.e., brain states) may serve as an intermediate phenotype supporting cognitive control in individuals with a spectrum of clinical symptoms. We leveraged machine learning and external validation to explore this question in three independent, transdiagnostic datasets (N>600), including participants with anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorder. To capture the multifaceted nature of cognitive control, we assessed two of its components, inhibition and shift, using both task-based and questionnaire data. Flexible brain state engagement predicted all cognitive control metrics in previously unseen individuals transdiagnostically, regardless of which dataset was used for model training. Connectome-based predictive modeling also revealed that shared brain networks underpinned flexible brain state engagement in a transdiagnostic manner. Leveraging brain network dynamics, we further observed that moments of more flexible brain state engagement aligned with moments of network connectivity related to better cognitive control within the same individual. This temporal alignment was replicated in all three datasets with heterogeneous samples. Altogether, this study provides robust evidence that flexible engagement of brain state may support both inter- and intra-individual differences in cognitive control across individuals with diverse mental health profiles.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Recent research suggests that pleasant touch is not solely mediated by CT activation, pointing to a potential contribution of A{beta}-afferents and cognitive processes, potentially through the mechanism of velocity inference. To investigate the contributions of A{beta}-afferents, our study compared the illusion of vibrotactile apparent motion, which recruits almost exclusively A{beta}-afferents, and brush stroking, which additionally recruits CT afferents. A first experiment investigated the impact of stroke contrast on the pleasantness of 3 cm/s strokes by mingling them with pleasant (1 and 10 cm/s) or less pleasant (0.5 and 30 cm/s) ones. A second experiment in virtual reality probed velocity inference from visual cue by testing how congruence between visual and tactile velocity affects perceived pleasantness. The results showed that the pleasantness of strokes targeting A{beta}-afferents also follows an inverted U-curve and that 3 cm/s reference strokes remained unaffected by the speed of mixed strokes regardless of the condition. Even though differences in incongruence were not clearly perceived, discrepant visual velocities influenced the pleasantness of vibrotactile 1 cm/s strokes, for which the pleasantness ratings followed the visual rather than the tactile velocity. Overall, vibrotactile pleasantness can be mediated by A{beta}-afferents, but most probably through velocity inference since only vibrotactile strokes were prone to visual illusion. Because not clearly detected, visual inferences could have played a stronger role through larger speed discrepancies.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Through data analysis and artificial neural network modeling, we find that structural asymmetry and functional separation--formalized by distinct optimization objectives--are necessary for simulating the experimental results. This suggests that the divergent functions of the BLA-DMS (exploration/precision) and CeA-DMS (stabilization/homeostasis) pathways are inherent, not learned. Under chronic stress, the brain adapts by strengthening the CeA-DMS pathway's stabilizing role. A robustness test (10 independent seeds) confirmed the statistical reliability of the results (e.g., Recovery Time difference), yet revealed a high Coefficient of Variation in pathway coupling weights ( approximately 40%), suggesting the brain preserves structural flexibility even while enforcing rigid functional outcomes.

For these applications, where angle-independent color is required, photonic glasses, composed of random arrangements of dielectric spheres, offer a promising solution. However, their intrinsic disorder, particularly from particle polydispersity, fundamentally limits their color saturation and practical utility. In contrast, insects like damselflies and dragonflies exhibit surprisingly vivid, non-iridescent structural colors, despite relying on disordered photonic structures. Here, we show how damselflies combine compositional and structural dispersion to overcome color saturation limits of photonic glasses. Firstly, doping transparent particles with yellow pigments dramatically enhances blue-green structural resonances by the coupled effects of narrowband absorption and refractive index (material) dispersion. Secondly, the refractive index of the nanospheres varies with their size and crystallinity. This gives rise to a 'structural dispersion' which maintains consistent optical path lengths in polydisperse assemblies, preserving high color purity. Finally, we show how damselflies tune their structural colors during maturation by precisely modulating the size of the nanospheres. Remarkably, the tuning of particle size, refractive index and pigment loading, arises naturally during the development of the pigment cells - where the pteridine nanospheres undergo a process of densification, crystallization and metabolic maturation.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

It consists of a gelatinous core (nucleus pulposus, NP) surrounded by a fibrous ring (annulus fibrosus, AF). Accumulation of microcracks and tears in the AF can lead to NP herniation outside the disc space, compressing the nerve roots and causing pain. Herniation is a leading cause of low back pain and represents a major socioeconomic burden, with no effective regenerative treatment currently available. Previously, we demonstrated the potential of a poly({varepsilon}-caprolactone) (PCL)-based implant for the closure of an annulus fibrosus (AF) defect. However, the slow in vivo degradation of PCL may hinder timely AF regeneration. Here, we hypothesized that accelerating PCL degradation kinetics by incorporating a lactide component, known for its rapid degradation, could enhance AF repair. To that aim, PCLA polymers of {varepsilon}-caprolactone and lactide were synthesised as a copolymer (C-CL90%LA10%) or a blend (B-PCL80%PLA20%). These polymers were electrospun into aligned nanofibrous sheets, which were then assembled into a biomimetic multi-lamellar 3D implant. Cytocompatibility was assessed in vitro using ovine AF cells and ex vivo using a bovine tail disc model. In vitro, PCLA sheets promoted ovine AF cell alignment, proliferation, and expression of type I and II collagen. Ex vivo, the multi-lamellar implant remained in place within a full-thickness (4 mm) annular defect in bovine tail discs for 4 weeks, with initial cell infiltration. Degradation and regenerative potential were then evaluated in an ovine lumbar full-thickness annular defect model at 1 month (n=4) and 6 months (n=10) after implantation. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed substantial cellular infiltration and neo-tissue ingrowth within implant layers, despite implant displacement in some cases. At 1 month, all implants retained their multi-lamellar structure with no visible degradation. By 6 months, the copolymer implants exhibited marked degradation, whereas PCL and blend implants remained structurally intact. Furthermore, ex vivo biomechanical testing revealed comparable flexibility to intact but much lower than non-implanted controls in axial rotation. This study confirms the accelerated degradation kinetics of PCLA copolymers within the disc microenvironment and demonstrates that the multi-lamellar PCLA implant can guide AF tissue repair.

C.; Ghazanfar, S.", "abstract": "The increased uptake of high-resolution spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies demands the development of unsupervised methods to extract cell types and their spatial distribution from biological tissues. However, unsupervised clustering is challenging due to the sparsity of the data and the differences in cell arrangement within tissues. Here, we introduce ClustSIGNAL, a spatial clustering method that adaptively uses neighbourhood information to overcome data sparsity and perform cell type clustering. ClustSIGNAL first defines initial clusters and sub-clusters of cells with similar gene expression patterns. For each cell, a fixed neighbourhood size is defined, and entropy is calculated based on the proportion of initial sub-clusters in the neighbourhood to capture its composition. Cell-specific weights, generated from entropy values, are used to embed spatial information into the gene expression through adaptive smoothing. The transformed gene expression is then used for clustering cell types. We compared our adaptive smoothing approach with other smoothing scenarios on four simulated datasets of varying spatial complexity. We also evaluated our clustering method on four publicly available high-resolution SRT datasets and compared its performance to that of three other spatial clustering methods. We showed that ClustSIGNAL performs multi-sample clustering with high accuracy and can identify subtle cell types and subtypes of biological relevance. It is also robust to changes in spatial structure of tissues, segmentation errors, and sparsity. Overall, ClustSIGNAL stabilises gene expression of cells in homogeneous neighbourhoods and preserves distinct gene expression of cells in heterogeneous regions, effectively balancing the use of neighbouring cells as prior knowledge for downstream analysis.

Method: We collected 50 normal and 374 tumor samples to investigate the differential expression of NABP2 in HCC. Variousgenomic, single-cell, and bioinformatic analyses, including gene microarray technology, were employed. Data processing and analysis were conducted using R language, focusing on the correlation between NABP2 expression, immune cell infiltration, drug sensitivity, and metabolic pathways. Results: Our findings indicate that NABP2 plays a significant role in the development of HCC and the tumor immune microenvironment. Analyses such as GSVA and GSEA suggest that NABP2 may influence disease progression through involvement in key molecular signaling pathways, including DNA replication, mRNA splicing, and protein degradation. Furthermore, a notable correlation was observed between NABP2 and various metabolic pathways, as well as specific immune cell populations. Additionally, we identified potential chemotherapeutic agents for HCC based on drug sensitivity analysis.

H.; Lyu, C.; Jiang, A.; Chen, L.", "abstract": "Survival prediction from high-dimensional biomedical data is frequently compromised by distribution shifts across multi-center cohorts, where models trained on specific populations often rely on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to new environments. While recent independence-driven reweighting techniques attempt to mitigate this, they typically treat patients as isolated instances, neglecting the intrinsic topological structures and biological pathways shared within patient populations. To address this limitation, we propose InvGraphCox (Invariant Graph Cox), a novel framework that integrates graph-structured representation learning with robust survival modeling. InvGraphCox constructs a $k$-nearest-neighbor patient graph to capture local manifold structures and employs a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) combined with a cohort-wise alignment mechanism to learn low-dimensional patient embeddings that are invariant to site-specific biases. We comprehensively evaluate the framework across three distinct experimental settings: the Curated Top-100 Gene Benchmark for stable biomarker identification, large-scale, high-dimensional transcriptomic datasets (Ovarian and Breast Cancer) for unsupervised representation learning, and clinical datasets (Breast and Lung Cancer) involving mixed-type covariates.

G.; Djambazova, K. V.; Dufresne, M.; Spraggins, J. M.; Van de Plas, R.", "abstract": "IMS experiments simultaneously map thousands of ion species throughout tissue. Its high-dimensionality makes human interpretation difficult and DR methods are common to facilitate exploration. Traditional DR methods, such as PCA, are general approaches, designed to work across application domains. They are usually unaware of, and unable to exploit correlations specific to a particular measurement type. Compression-focused, such `blind' methods often deliver physically impossible latent patterns or make feature combinations that confuse rather than aid human understanding. We introduce a novel chemistry-informed DR method, IsoSpace, with built-in awareness of MS-relevant patterns. Although generalizable, IsoSpace substantiates `chemistry-informed' as sensitive to potential isotopic relationships. Like traditional DR methods, IsoSpace groups mz-features to deliver a low-dimensional representation of IMS data. Unlike traditional methods, IsoSpace ensures that retrieved latent patterns constitute potential isotopic families. IsoSpace's decomposition facilitates IMS interpretation at the molecular species rather than ion species level, implicitly automating isotope candidate detection. Most de-isotoping techniques ignore spatial relationships or rely on molecular class assumptions, making them less suitable for molecularly diverse tissue environments. IsoSpace avoids such assumptions, integrating spatial and spectral cues to empirically detect potential isotopic peaks. IsoSpace uses non-negative matrix factorization and an m/z-pattern matrix to uncover isotopic-like sequences, evaluating them by intra-pattern correlation. In a mouse pup example with 879 m/z-peaks, IsoSpace identified 71 potential isotopic patterns, substantially reducing data complexity while preserving chemical understanding.

W.", "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterial pathogen that is the causative agent of several infectious diseases, notably the severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' Disease. L. pneumophila targets amoebas and, in humans, alveolar macrophages. L. pneumophila infects its host by envelopment into the host cell through phagocytosis followed by the activation of the Type IV Secretion System (T4SS). The T4SS secretes effector proteins into the host cell which deactivate cell defenses and reprogram cell function to support L. pneumophila reproduction. After reproduction, L. pneumophila lyses the host cell and the cycle repeats, causing swelling and destroying a primary cell in the host's immune system--infections caused by L. pneumophila are notoriously hard to treat. The stages of the infection process are known but the physical mechanisms are poorly understood. The structure of the T4SS includes a 13 member polymer, DotG which protrudes from the outer leaflet of the bacterial outer membrane. Given this exposure and the necessity of T4SS for infection, DotG is a promising drug target. However, designing an effective drug requires understanding the physical mechanisms. Via MD simulations we have tested hypotheses regarding its function. Specifically, we show the feasibility that an applied force on IcmX, a plug-like penta-mer that initially blocks transport through the T4SS channel, can cause a structural change in DotG and allow for protein release. Further, this applied force could reasonably come from a build up of pressure in the channel from other effector proteins. We conclude that the process of secretion is dependent on the induced structural change in DotG. Inhibiting this change provides a possible drug development direction.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Although modern live-imaging techniques now allow detailed monitoring of cell morphology, incorporating such complex geometrical information into mathematical models has remained a major challenge. Conventional modeling approaches often rely on artificial cell shape assumptions or purely in silico constructions, and discrete imaging data remain fundamentally mismatched with continuous biochemical models based on differential equations. As a result, current models struggle to accurately reproduce biochemical dynamics within realistic, dynamically changing cell geometries. To overcome these limitations, we establish a novel mathematical framework, Imaging Data-based Model Description (IDMD), which integrates Optimal Transport (OT) theory with phase-field (PF) modeling to bridge imaging data and mathematical models. Using live-imaging data from in vitro cultured cells and the one-cell C. elegans embryo, we demonstrate the versatility of our framework. By directly incorporating real cell geometry into mathematical modeling, our framework provides a powerful new avenue for investigating how geometrical constraints regulate biochemical pattern formation and cell-fate decisions.

RNA sequencing and pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in the MAPK signaling pathway, highlighting EGFR and HRAS as crucial therapeutic targets. Given the limited clinical success of existing EGFR-targeted therapies and the scarcity of HRAS inhibitors, a natural product-based approach was adopted. Molecular docking of 17,000 phytochemicals identified Pratenol B, Eriodictyol, Losbanine, and Isookanin as promising inhibitors, with Pratenol B showing dual inhibition of EGFR and HRAS. These compounds exhibited strong binding affinities, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, high bioavailability, and low toxicity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of Pratenol B with both target proteins, surpassing reference inhibitors. Utilizing vast medicinal plant diversity presents a cost-effective and low-toxicity avenue for OSCC therapy.

A proportion of these polymers are detectable in the circulation. This study aimed to provide data on the dynamics of AAT monomers and polymers in the circulation after correction of a deficiency state by liver transplantation. The evolution of the circulating AAT phenotype was characterised quantitatively over time by analysis of blood samples taken pre- and post-liver transplant from three PiZZ AAT deficiency patients, using a panel of conformer-specific monoclonal antibodies and a novel ELISA with enhanced sensitivity for AAT polymers. Circulating wild-type M AAT was found to increase with a half-time of 29-39 h, attaining a clinically-defined putative protective threshold level within 24-50 h post-transplant. Baseline circulating polymer levels ranged from 5-35  g/mL with a half-time clearance of 3-12 h following transplant, and levels were indistinguishable from reference wild-type plasma 22 months post-surgery.

Bioaccumulation of MNPs in lung tissues has been studied, but effect of tobacco smoking on deposition is not well understood. Tobacco smoke is known to contain heavy metals which can get adsorbed to the MNP surface, leading to increased environmental bioavailability. We hypothesized that smoking leads to enhanced chelation of heavy metals with airborne MNPs leading to accentuated lung bioaccumulation, thereby leading to lung pathologies. Methods: Age (20-75 years) and sex-matched archival lung tissue samples from smokers (n = 9) and non-smokers (n = 10) were procured and quantified to assess: (a) the levels of MNPs by pyro-GC/MS and (b) heavy metals by ICP-MS. Furthermore, to establish if there exists a correlation between MNP deposition and disease occurrence in current smokers, tissue samples from age-matched patients with COPD (n = 4) and IPF (n = 4) underwent pyro-GC/MS analyses. Results: A relatively higher level of MNPs were found in the lungs of smokers (43.67 mcg/gm) as compared to non-smoker (34.53 mcg/gm) upon pyro-GC/MS analyses. We observed a marked increase in the levels of polyethylene (PE; p< 0.0076), polycarbonate (PC; p< 0.0947) and nylon6 (N6; p < 0.0653) polymers in the lungs of smokers as compared to non-smokers. Metal analyses showed a significant (p <0.0001) increase in the levels of cadmium (Cd) in the lungs of smokers with the levels of deposited Cd being more pronounced for female smokers. Importantly, we observed a strong correlation (p < 0.05) between the amounts of accumulated PE and levels of Cd in the lungs. Pyro-GC/MS analyses did not reveal any relation between MNP deposition and disease occurrence in our study. Furthermore, little to no change in the level of deposited MNPs was observed in the lungs of current versus ex-smokers in disease cohorts. Conclusions: Overall, our results show that smoking promotes bioaccumulation of certain MNPs (PE) with heavy metals (Cd) which may lead to adverse lung effects in smokers.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

While some of the molecules involved in nutrient sensing within EECs have been described, there have been no systematic studies to map the relevant genes and pathways. Here, we developed a strategy to perform a high-throughput screen for genes that are required for nutrient-induced activation of EECs, and we applied this to probe mechanisms for sensing dietary protein. We found that all of the genes previously proposed to function as protein sensors in EECs are, collectively, dispensable for protein sensing in an EEC cell line. Instead, a screen of >20,000 sgRNAs identified numerous genes associated with mitochondrial respiration as being necessary for this process. We showed through secondary assays that impairing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) reduced EEC activation and GLP-1 release in response to nutrients but not in response to a non-nutritive stimulus. On the other hand, boosting OXPHOS increased EEC activation and GLP-1 release. These data reveal that intracellular metabolism within EECs controls the detection of dietary protein, possibly by monitoring the entry of ingested amino acids into the TCA cycle.

Here, to identify proteins that physically interact with MtARFA1, a yeast two hybrid screening was performed using a cDNA library of Medicago truncatula roots inoculated with Sinorhizobium meliloti. One of the identified MtARF1 interactors is a protein that possesses a BTB/POZ domain.

Through combined epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling, we found that glial progenitor cells (hGPCs) generated from HD-derived human embryonic stem cells exhibit persistent histone hyperacetylation, enabling the ectopic expression of a broad set of KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) transcriptional repressors. Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of HD hGPCs revealed that their aberrant KZFP expression was attended by the persistent expression of neural progenitor-stage genes relative to wild-type hGPCs. The HD hGPCs over-expressed the MYST family histone acetyltransferase KAT6B, which led to their hyperacetylation at H3K9 and associated DNA demethylation, and displayed abnormally open chromatin, particularly at promoters of chromosome 19 KZFP gene clusters. Among those KZFPs most differentially activated in HD hGPCs was the primate-specific ZNF98, whose overexpression in wild-type hGPCs recapitulated the HD-associated suppression of glial development. These data implicate abnormal histone hyperacetylation in HD glial progenitor cells, and its associated over-expression of recently evolved KZFP transcriptional repressors, as a critical mechanism by which both astrocytic and oligodendrocytic differentiation are impaired in HD.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

By segmenting chromatophores into radial slices and analyzing anisotropic deformations, we applied dimensionality reduction (PCA) and source separation (ICA) to estimate the number and spatial influence of motor neurons responsible for the control of individual and groups of chromatophores. On average, four independent components were detected (suggesting innervation by four motor neurons), each forming contiguous petal-shaped domains rather than causing uniform expansion. Clustering thousands of components revealed motor units spanning multiple chromatophores, most involving fewer than 14 but occasionally spanning more widely. These motor units displayed a wide variety of geometries, ranging from compact local groups to elongated or fragmented structures; they often overlapped, with repeated co-innervation of chromatophore pairs occurring more often than expected by chance. Expansion was consistently faster and more stereotyped than relaxation, consistent with active contraction (corresponding to chromatophore expansion) and passive recoil (chromatophore contraction). Together, these results show that individual chromatophores are not singular or uniform pixels, but rather contrast elements that can be fractionated into smaller territories, themselves coordinated with those of other chromatophores. This geometry of neural control enables, among others, the generation of \"virtual\" chromatophores (by convergence of adjacent territories of neighbouring chromatophores) as well as that of noise in the distribution of pixel shapes.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Yet listeners and single neurons can encode sound in world-centred spatial reference frames. However, most studies of sound localisation constrain the subject's orientation within a fixed speaker ring, making it difficult to distinguish which reference frame underlies spatial coding. We utilised a sound localisation task that required ferrets localise sound location, relative to the head, across rotations in the starting platform within the testing arena. Two ferrets were trained to discriminate front from back sounds. Once trained, the orientation of both the central platform and the target speakers were rotated between testing sessions, retaining the task contingency in head-centered coordinates, but breaking the alignment of head and world centered reference frames. Probe trials were presented from the other speakers so that spatial receptive fields could be constructed and compared across central platform rotations. Neural activity was recorded from auditory cortex using chronically implanted 32-channel arrays. Across 1,777 recorded units, 596 were stimulus driven. Spatially tuned neurons were predominantly head-centred, with 208 and 232 units classified as head-centred in the two animals, compared with 48 and 49 world-centred units and 33 and 26 un-tuned units, respectively. Temporal analysis showed that most units retained the same reference-frame classification from onset to offset, but the magnitude of their head-versus-world preference diminished over time, with offset responses shifting towards more ambiguous and, in some cases, world-centred coding.

Importantly, these gradual representational changes were behaviorally relevant, predicting trial-level performance. Our results show that behavioral flexibility is supported by incremental, task-dependent refinement of representational geometry already within sensory cortex - far earlier in the processing hierarchy than previously thought.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

This study adopts a trajectory-based approach to explore the temporal relationship between brain structure and dynamic changes in depressive symptoms across adolescence. Methods: We used a large longitudinal adolescent neuroimaging sample across five annual waves (n = 11,862; mean age = 9.91 at baseline) from the ABCD study. First, growth mixture models were applied separately for males and females to identify distinct developmental trajectories of depressive symptoms. We then used linear mixed-effects models to identify which baseline brain structural features differentiated trajectory classes, and how these trajectories influenced subsequent brain structure. Results: We identified high-decreasing, stable-low, and low-increasing trajectories in females, and relatively stable high, moderate, and low trajectories in males. No baseline brain regions were found to be associated with female trajectories, whereas smaller global brain measures (total subcortical volume, cortical volume, and surface area) predicted the high trajectory in males. Regarding brain outcomes, a low-increasing trajectory in females was associated with smaller global subcortical and cortical volumes, while high and moderate trajectories in males predicted thinner global cortices. Additional trajectory-related regional brain alterations were observed in both sexes. Conclusions: These findings highlight distinct neurodevelopmental patterns linked to depressive symptom trajectories in males and females, underscoring the importance of a sex-specific and longitudinal approach to identifying neural risk and outcomes in adolescent depression.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Its single acute exposure has been linked to delayed neurological and neurodegenerative outcomes. However, the molecular and cellular pathways driving these long-term manifestations remain poorly defined. In this study, combining human iPSC-derived neuronal and in vivo mouse model, we uncovered that the acute ATO exposure activates cellular stress pathway, which drives long-term neurotoxic and associated functional outcomes. We found that ATO induces integrated stress response (ISR) signaling in human iPSC-derived neurons. To model the impact of accidental ATO exposure in vivo, we administered a single high dose of ATO to C57BL/6J wild type mice. Four weeks post-treatment, ATO-exposed mice displayed neuropsychological symptoms and cognitive deficits. Brain analyses of ATO-challenged mice revealed elevated ISR activity marked by the increased phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2 and upregulation of the transcription factors, CHOP and ATF4. Transcriptomic profiling using bulk RNAseq revealed activation of pathways associated with stress and neuroinflammatory responses. Consistently, increased DNA damage and dysregulation of the STING-mediated innate immune response were also found in the brain of ATO-challenged mice. Pharmacological inhibition of the ISR with a small-molecule inhibitor, ISRIB mitigated ISR activation and preserved synaptic integrity in mouse hippocampal cells. In conclusion, our data identify ISR activation and DNA damage-driven immune dysregulation as key pathogenic drivers of ATO-induced delayed neurotoxicity and cognitive deficits and highlight ISR inhibitors as promising therapeutics to mitigate these effects.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Y.; Qiu, L.; Sivakumar, N.; Knight, Z. A.", "abstract": "The passage of food through the alimentary canal generates a series of feedback signals that are sensed by the brain and used to control behavior. Many of these signals converge on the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS), a brainstem structure that is the direct target of the vagal sensory neurons that innervate the throat, stomach and intestines and detect ingested food. These vagal neurons are thought to transmit key gut-brain signals that trigger meal termination, but how this information is represented in the cNTS, and used to control behavior, is largely unknown. Here, we have used a preparation for single-cell imaging in the cNTS of behaving animals to characterize how food ingestion is encoded in the caudal brainstem. We find that when food is delivered directly to the stomach, thereby bypassing the oral cavity, cNTS neurons exhibit ramping activation that occurs over many minutes and depends on canonical gut-brain pathways. However, when the same food is consumed by mouth, most cNTS neurons exhibit phasic, seconds-timescale responses that are time-locked to oral contact of food or cues that predict food delivery. We show that this rapid feedback is due to a combination of mechanical, gustatory and nutritive signals signals from the mouth and throat and does not require canonical gut-brain pathways, including gut-innervating vagal afferents, although GI feedback modulates the duration of these pregastric responses. We show that one source of this rapid input is descending projections from the paraventricular hypothalamus, which track ingestion dynamics and are required for proper meal termination. These findings reveal that the caudal brainstem makes extensive use of pregastric signals that track the dynamics of ingestion for the rapid control of food consumption.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

We show that X-TRAP knock-in mice exhibit undetectable Flp recombination in the absence of drug and that branaplam treatment results in robust induction of recombination selectively in neurons that express FOS. Moreover, we show that X-TRAP is orthogonal to the widely-used TRAP system, such that these two approaches can be used in the same animal to label cells with Cre and Flp recombination in response to two different stimuli. We apply this strategy to map neural circuits that control food intake.

Within the dorsal CA1, distinct pyramidal cell subpopulations of the deep and superficial layer may play distinct roles in the processing and updating of spatial information. Using a Cre-dependent mouseline, we were able to precisely target the superficial, Calbindin (CALB1+) PCs of the CA1. This allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the connectivity of CALB1+ CA1 PCs to their SWR-propagating excitatory output partners within the Subiculum (SUB), the burst-firing SUB PCs and their functional relevance in spatial memory consolidation and recall. Retrograde rabies tracing revealed heterogeneous innervation of the VGlut2+ bursting PCs by both CA1 PC sublayers, and showed that the majority of presynaptic inputs are located in the superficial CA1 PC layer. We were able to observe that this anatomically confirmed connection between CALB1+ CA1 PCs and both SUB PC subtypes is able to induce spiking more reliably in burst- than regular-firing SUB PCs. CNO-induced inhibition in a Barnes Maze task revealed that the experimental group showed reduced cognitive flexibility and were slower to adapt to re-location of the goal when CALB1+ CA1 PCs were inhibited during the recall (test), while both groups behaved similarly when consolidation was manipulated (training). Inhibition did not impact overall learning, strategy development or locomotor control. This suggests that CALB1+ CA1 PCs preferentially connect to bursting SUB PCs, and support cognitive flexibility needed to adapt to a changing environment, adding further proof to the functional relevance of laminar segregation of the CA1 and the hippocampus in spatial memory processes.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Dopamine, a critical regulator of light adaptation, is also reduced in diabetes and supplementation of dopamine or injection of dopamine agonists improve visual deficits in diabetic rodents and humans. We sought to examine how blocking D4Rs and D1Rs would affect ERG signaling in 6-week diabetic rodents. Blocking D4Rs with L745,870 significantly reduced dark-adapted A-wave amplitude in DM, but not non-DM retinas, with no change in a-wave implicit timing, suggesting diabetic alterations in D4R signaling in photoreceptors. Light-adapted (LA) recordings revealed blocking D4Rs significantly increased A-wave amplitude and delayed A-wave implicit timing in DM and non-DM retinas. B-wave amplitudes were elevated at the highest flash intensity, and rise time was significantly faster, indicating an inability to adjust to background light. D1R blockade with SCH-23390 had little effect on ERG recordings for both groups, aside from increased B-wave amplitude and delayed rise time in dark-adapted DM conditions towards the lower light intensities. While small, D4R blockade seems to have a bigger effect in DM conditions during light adaptation, suggesting that diabetes impairs the retinas ability to adjust to light adaptation.

Since dopamine receptors are localized throughout the mouse retina, it is not known where in the light signaling cascade dopamine is modulating signals to OFF bipolar cells. The goal of this work was to develop a technique that allowed for the isolation of the amacrine to OFF bipolar cell circuit and determine if there are local changes in inhibition elicited by presynaptic amacrine cells onto OFF bipolar cells. To do this, we utilized the B6.Cg-Tg(Slc32al-COP4*H134R/EYFP) mouse line. These mice contain ChR2 in all the inhibitory cells in the retina. By optogenetically activating the amacrine cells, we were able to elicit inhibitory currents on bipolar cells independent of photoreceptor activation. Additionally, we were able to pharmacologically block inputs from photoreceptors while simultaneously isolating individual GABAergic and glycinergic inputs to OFF bipolar cells. While these optogenetically elicited currents were distinct from previously recorded light evoked currents, we found this as an effect way to measure changes in SKF38393 mediated reductions in glycinergic currents on OFF bipolar cells. However, we did not observe changes in GABAergic inhibition as we have previously seen in light evoked currents.

This study aimed to characterize the metabolic and immune dysregulation of SjD using a multi-omics approach, focusing on the metabolic environment and B-cell transcriptomic responses. Methods: Transcriptomic, methylomic, and metabolomic datasets from whole blood, plasma, and urine of 293 SjD patients and 508 controls were analyzed from the PRECISESADS study. B-cell transcriptomes were included to link systemic metabolic alterations to cell-intrinsic immune programs. Multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA) was used to integrate data and identify discriminant molecular drivers. Results: Multi-omics integration revealed metabolic rewiring involving the urea cycle, glutamine/arginine metabolism, and NAD depletion linked to interferon signaling. Among the strongest contributors, plasma lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) emerged as key discriminants associated with interferon-driven activation. B-cell transcriptomes showed upregulation of LPA-related genes (CERS6, INPP1, TRIP6), and its receptor LPAR6. Importantly, in this study LPAR6 protein expression was confirmed in B cells for the first time. Secondary findings included alterations in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) metabolism, suggesting a broader lysophospholipid signaling axis. Conclusions: This study identifies the LPA-LPAR6 signaling axis as a potential metabolic driver of B-cell activation and interferon-associated inflammation in SjD, highlighting a previously unrecognized immunometabolic pathway.

Alternative splicing has been implicated as one mechanism that may underlie the response of organisms to their environments. However, most studies of this type examine immediate effects of an environmental perturbation on patterns of alternative splicing; little is known about the long-term consequences of early life environments. Here, we show the early life environment exerts a lasting influence on patterns of alternative splicing in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). This species is sensitive to conspecific density (crowding), with a transgenerational (mother-to-daughter) wing polyphenism cued by this environmental signal. We demonstrate that the maternal environment during embryonic development alters daughters' alternative splicing profiles independently of morph identity, and that these effects persist into adulthood. By comparing the magnitude of maternal-environment effects to morph-specific differences, we reveal that the influence of early environmental conditions on splicing is unexpectedly large. These findings suggest that environmental history can leave a persistent molecular imprint beyond its role in morph determination. More broadly, this work highlights the need to disentangle environmental and morph-specific transcriptomic variation in studies of developmental polyphenism and connects to broader efforts, across biology and medicine, to understand how early life experiences shape long-term molecular and physiological outcomes.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Microclimates are critical for understanding how organisms interact with their environments, influencing behaviour, physiology, and species distributions. However, traditional physical heat-balance models for predicting ground temperatures in microhabitats often exhibit biases due to unaccounted environmental complexities and poorly constrained parameters. These limitations can hinder ecological research and conservation planning, particularly in the context of climate change. 2. In this study, we demonstrate how high-resolution drone-based mapping and machine learning can improve the accuracy of microclimate models. Using drone imagery, we generated detailed environmental maps, including solar radiation, vegetation indices, and skyview factors, to parameterize a physical heat-balance model. Validation with thermal maps derived from drone-mounted infrared cameras revealed systematic errors in the physical model's predictions, including over- and underestimations under specific environmental conditions. To address these errors, we applied a random forest machine learning model to predict and correct biases in new prediction maps. 3. Our results show that machine learning reduced mean absolute errors by over 30% and mean square errors by 50%, while consistently narrowing the range of prediction inaccuracies. Key factors driving biases, such as vegetation cover, solar radiation, and height above ground, were identified, offering valuable insights for improving physical models. The machine learning corrections not only improved accuracy but also highlighted parameters and processes that were previously underrepresented or oversimplified in traditional models. 4. These findings illustrate the potential of ML to improve microclimate predictions. While our drone-based approach is most applicable to open, sparsely vegetated habitats, the principle of ML bias correction can be extended to other systems as well. Correcting microclimate models with ML and observational data provides ecologists and conservation practitioners with a powerful framework for generating more accurate microclimate estimates. Such improvements deepen our understanding of species' responses to climate change and support climate-resilient management strategies.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Changes in GVC H2 concentrations after feeding suggest that feeding modulates substrate availability, which in turn influences microbial activity in this compartment. In bleached corals, the GVC remained consistently hypoxic and acidic, and anaerobic metabolic processes persisted across the diel cycle. These patterns suggest a shift in energy and nutrient cycling pathways within the bleached coral holobiont.

A.", "abstract": "The location at which a species assemblage is observed can be uncertain, for example in fisheries where catch composition is recorded accurately but location data may be coarse or inaccurate. In such cases, spatial signals in observed species compositions can help identify and refine uncertain locations. This study explored three approaches for location estimation using species composition data: 1) a hierarchical species distribution model (SDM) that jointly estimates species distributions and location uncertainty, 2) an inverse prediction method that uses a fitted SDM to identify the most likely location given new species data, and 3) the direct modeling of location as the response variable. Each approach requires a subset of observations with accurate locations to quantify the spatial patterns in species distributions. All three methods were useful and reasonably accurate: for the simulated data the average distance error (distance to true location) was 15% the size of the domain, and for the real data this error was 20-100 km. When only some locations are uncertain, the hierarchical approach is valuable due to its integrated estimation of location and species parameters. When many locations are uncertain, the other approaches seem more suitable. Inverse prediction is ideal when prior information is available to constrain the location estimation. Direct modelling (although causally spurious) is well suited to large datasets, with multivariate random forests often providing the most accurate location estimates. These methods can enhance spatial data quality in ecological monitoring and help develop tools for improving inaccurate or deliberately misreported fishing locations.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

A.; Reich, P. B.", "abstract": "Climate warming is altering the timing of seasonal growth in cold-temperate and boreal ecosystems, with potential consequences for forests on multiple continents. It has been hypothesized that in a warming climate, earlier growth in spring might lead to a longer growing season and thus higher annual total growth. However, whether the period of active growth is longer in a warming climate is unclear, as is whether changes in growth rate might reinforce or offset the effect of changing growing season length in modulating annual total growth. Understanding responses in growth to warming is crucial to projecting forest dynamics under future climate change. To address this, we experimentally warmed (by +1.62 and 3.26 {degrees}C on average) open-air southern boreal forest plots for 14 years (2010 to 2023) and measured juvenile height growth from spring until fall for 20 tree and shrub species, with a total of 11,565 individual-year growth trajectories. Across all species and in various canopy (open, closed) and rainfall (ambient, reduced) contexts, experimental warming consistently advanced the timing of height growth (4.32 days per 3 {degrees}C warming). However, species differed in their annual total growth responses. Evergreen gymnosperms such as spruce, fir, and pine tended to exhibit suppressed annual total growth under warming (-15.8% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by a shorter duration of active growth, despite an earlier start, with little change in relative growth rate. In contrast, deciduous angiosperms and non-native shrubs often show enhanced annual total growth under warming (19.3 and 37.4% per 3 {degrees}C warming), driven by faster rate, longer duration, or a combination of both. More broadly, species with a more conservative lifestyle responded less positively in the duration and rate of growth, thus placing them at a disadvantage under warming. These contrasting responses challenge assumptions that an earlier start of the growing season universally enhances growth and highlight how warming may shift both the timing and pace of growth and thus alter community composition within mixed-species forests.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Over longer timescales, insects have also evolved resistance to naturally-occurring toxins to exploit new ecological niches, but much less is known about the mechanisms underlying such adaptations. A classic example is Drosophila sechellia, an extreme specialist for the ripe noni fruit of Morinda citrifolia, which is toxic for other insects - including the close relatives D. simulans and D. melanogaster - due to noni's high content of octanoic acid (OA). The mechanistic bases underlying susceptibility and resistance to OA of different species remain unclear. Here, we first show that the species-specific tolerance of OA is independent of these drosophilids' distinct microbiomes, reinforcing the notion that this trait is genetically encoded. Screening large, genetically-diverse panels of D. melanogaster and D. simulans strains revealed broad variation in OA resistance, with some lines surviving as well as D. sechellia. Resistance to OA does not correlate with resistance of these lines to other insecticides, implying a distinct toxicity mode-of-action. Genome-wide association and transcriptome-to-phenotype analyses identified multiple genes linked to OA resistance. These genes have diverse expression patterns and functions, including proteins involved in epithelial septate junction formation, lipid transport and tracheal morphogenesis. Loss-of-function analysis in D. melanogaster confirmed that at least two of these - Bez, a CD36-family fatty acid transporter, and CG13003, a putative extracellular matrix component - positively contribute to OA resistance. Integration of our findings with those from previous complementary genetic approaches supports a model in which OA has no singular target, and that resistance to this toxin is defined by multigenic and multi-tissue defense mechanisms.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Valine-to-serine (V[-&gt;]S) and threonine-to-serine (T[-&gt;]S) mistranslating models of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster have demonstrated a surprising, sex-specific increase in virgin female longevity. We predict that the added stressor of reproduction would eliminate this mistranslation-induced lifespan increase since females prioritize reproductive tissues over somatic tissues, and proteotoxic stress would therefore lead to higher protein damage in the soma of mated females. We measured the impact of reproduction on V[-&gt;]S and T[-&gt;]S mistranslating D. melanogaster by measuring longevity, egg laying, and fecundity. Counter to our prediction, both V[-&gt;]S and T[-&gt;]S mistranslation led to a sex-specific increase in mated female longevity compared to non-mistranslating controls. Additionally, the risk of death decreased for mated females with mistranslation, beyond the pure additive benefits of mistranslation alone. These effects could not be explained by reduced egg laying or fertilization rates in mistranslating females. Thus, we find that the added proteotoxic stress caused by mistranslation does not exacerbate the detrimental effects of reproduction and instead can ameliorate lifespan decreases due to female reproduction.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

As next-generation sequencing has become more affordable, increasing numbers of large-scale metagenomics studies have been published, alongside raw sequencing data. With the growing number of new jingmenvirus sequences identified in metagenomics data, it can be difficult to assess whether a new sequence is associated to a new virus species or to a strain of an existing species. In order to propose clear classification criteria for this group, we assembled a large jingmenvirus sequence database, from published and newly assembled sequences. Indeed, we screened data from studies that did not search for or report jingmenvirus sequences, looking for new strains of known jingmenvirus species. We then performed multiple sequence alignments and used the inferred percentage identity values to determine demarcation criteria based on the distribution of evolutionary distances upon pairwise comparisons. We report the identification of almost 60 libraries containing jingmenvirus sequences, in a wide range of sample types and geographical locations. Using these data and published jingmenvirus sequences, we have determined that to classify jingmenvirus sequences into virus species, at least four segments are required, on which eight cut-off values in percentage identity (nucleotide and amino acid) are used for demarcation. The ratification of this proposal would enhance consistency in virus taxonomy and provide a standardized framework for comparative genomics studies of jingmenviruses, a group that is yet under-characterised.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

E.; Corbit, L. H.", "abstract": "A significant limitation of extinction-based therapies is their failure to be expressed across time and different contexts. The re-emergence of the original behaviour provides evidence that extinction training does not erase the original learning but rather relies on new learning that suppresses the expression of the original behaviour. Thus, a strategy for reducing relapse phenomena is to enhance the inhibitory learning that occurs during extinction training so that extinction is more robust. One such strategy is compound extinction where a combination of previously reinforced stimuli are presented together for the first time during extinction training. This treatment has been shown to enhance extinction learning, evidenced by reduced future spontaneous recovery. However, the mechanisms are not fully understood. Experiment 1 assessed whether the compound extinction effect is the result of increased expectation of reward generated by the compound of stimuli that is then violated, driving further learning, or more simply, the novelty of the compound which reengages attention and thus promotes extinction without increasing prediction error. Experiment 2 tested whether the effects of the noradrenaline beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, shown elsewhere to reduce the compound extinction effect, relate to prediction error or novelty. We found that, when equating the novelty of the stimulus compound, larger prediction error resulted in better extinction evidenced as reduced spontaneous recovery. Further, we found that propranolol reduced this effect suggesting that prediction error rather than novelty is important for both the behavioural and pharmacological effects. Together our results point to behavioural and pharmacological strategies that can be used to improve the long-term expression of extinction.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

However, until recently the potential for affective states in invertebrates has been underappreciated, especially for positive affective states where research is limited to a single order. Here, we adapt cognitive bias tests to examine both negative (pessimistic) and positive (optimistic) bias in cockroaches (Blaptica dubia) in order to expand the taxonomic reach of affective state research and to provide a rare test for positive affective states in an invertebrate. We trained cockroaches to associate two different odours with either positive or negative reinforcement and then assessed their reactions to ambiguous stimuli (a range of mixtures of the trained odours). We found that cockroaches exposed to light were more pessimistic (negative affective state) than controls, while those exposed to the scent of opposite sex conspecifics were marginally more optimistic (positive affective state) than controls. We therefore demonstrate the potential for affective states in cockroaches and for positive affective states in invertebrates more widely, indicating a hereto unexpected level of cognitive complexity.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Recent technological advances, including Perturb-seq and related assays, have enabled high-throughput screening of genetic perturbation effects on single cells. Several machine learning tools have also been developed to infer the effect of single-cell perturbations. However, both approaches are generally limited to dissociated cells, and the effect of genetic perturbations on neighboring cells within intact tissue has not yet been explored. Here we introduce a computational framework using graph neural networks for predicting the effect of multi-gene, multi-cell type perturbations on cells in whole tissue sections. We leverage the natural heterogeneity in tissue microenvironments across spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics datasets to train SpatialProp (Spatial Propagation of Single-cell Perturbations). We show that SpatialProp can predict gene expression from the tissue microenvironment and map fine-grained steering of tissue microenvironments to new target states. To assess for causal enrichment in spatial perturbation predictions, we propose CausalInteractionBench, a bidirectional benchmarking approach using curated cell-cell interactions. Under this benchmark, we evaluate the causal utility of SpatialProp in predicting the spatial effects of different perturbations.

Current state-of-the-art design pipelines utilize sequence design methods with local structural context and autoregressive generation. To improve efficiency and quality of sequence design, we developed TriFlow, a model that combines a RoseTTAFold-like three-track architecture for global structural context with discrete flow-matching for efficient few-step sequence generation. We trained TriFlow on a large dataset of interacting protein chains from PDB and interacting domains from AlphaFold protein structure Database to enrich its knowledge of natural protein/domain interfaces. While showing improvements across diverse benchmarks, TriFlow's primary advance is in de novo binder design, where it boosts the in silico success rate of state-of-the-art design pipelines such as BindCraft. We demonstrated this by conducting a large-scale benchmark, generating and validating binders for over 500 diverse protein targets. By leveraging the model to explore the designed sequence landscape, we discovered that we can effectively highlight functional active sites, by contrasting constraints learned by the structure-conditioned model with natural evolutionary profiles. As a practical demonstration of its capabilities, we apply our pipeline to systematically design specific binders against human class I cytokines family, computationally optimizing for on-target affinity while minimizing off-target interactions, demonstrating that specificity also scales with inference time computational budget. TriFlow thus provides a robust framework for both large-scale protein engineering and for exploring the fundamental principles of the structure-conditioned sequence landscape.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Regarding volume homeostasis, active exchange pumps are critical, as is also significant in the mechanisms of cell division, growth, and apoptosis. In the sense of the immersed boundary (IB) method, we replace classical interface conditions across the membrane with regularized chemical potentials to control the permeation of each ionic species governed by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation. As a consequence of the model simulation, electroneutrality, except for the thin space charge layers along the membrane, is well satisfied. In asymmetry, to regulate ionic transport, continuous chemical potential barriers are augmented with energetic gradients represented by smoothed Heaviside kernels specifying the directions of active pumps. We obtain steady-state concentrations from electrodiffusion active pumps with Na+, K+, Cl- ionic species and background charges in the unified entire domain in a periodic boundary condition. The electrodiffusion active pump model for the exchange of sodium and potassium (NKE) shows a fitting to the theoretical formula in a broad range of perturbations in the ionic concentrations, realizing the volume conservation in the steady state only when active pumps work. It is also shown that van't Hoff's law is satisfied without active pumps.

To further improve the robustness and reliability of complexity estimation, we introduce a multivariate sample entropy approach that incorporates T2* signals derived from multi-echo BOLD signal. We applied this method to compare a cohort of 23 elder adults and 12 younger adults, and observed significant group differences in several brain regions.

M.", "abstract": "Head and neck cancer (HNC), the seventh most frequent malignancy globally, is a serious health concern. Despite advancements in treatment, the overall survival rate for HNC remains around 50%, with even poorer outcomes in metastatic cases. This highlights the urgent need to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying HNC for improved diagnostics and therapies. The importance of non-coding RNAs, especially long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), in a variety of malignancies, including HNC, has been highlighted in recent researches. Although lncRNAs and mRNA are very similar, lncRNAs do not encode proteins and they are longer than 200 nucleotides. While studies have implicated lncRNAs in several cancers, including HNC, their exact role in HNC remains unclear, and there are currently no clinically established lncRNA biomarkers for diagnosis or therapy. Thus, this study aims to identify novel lncRNAs and investigate their significance in HNC. For this, we looked over recent research and discovered a new lncRNA called KLHDC7B-DT. The KLHDC7B-DT is significantly upregulated in HNC patient samples, and this result is corroborated by TCGA HNC data and cell lines. Further investigation suggests that KLHDC7B-DT may be linked with cancer stage, grade, age, and worse patient survival. We identified potential miRNAs that interact with KLHDC7B-DT and presented mRNA targets of these miRNAs, along with their possible functions. We propose that KLHDC7B-DT may regulate IL-6 expression in HNC, either through miRNAs or alternative mechanisms. Additionally, we found a significant positive correlation between the neighboring protein-coding gene KLHDC7B and the KLHDC7B-DT in HNC, both of which are significantly upregulated in HNC. In conclusion, KLHDC7B-DT is upregulated in HNC and holds promise as a prognostic and therapeutic biomarker.

While TP53 loss is an established driver of Del17p, the potential therapeutically-relevant cellular vulnerabilities of this common aneuploidy remain unexplored. Here, we first analyzed genomic and clinical data from breast cancer patients using METABRIC and TCGA datasets. Del17p was prevalent across molecular subtypes and correlated with higher tumor grade, advanced stage, and worse survival. Gene expression profiling revealed reduced expression and activity of the chromosome 17p-residing gene Aurora Kinase B (AURKB) in Del17p tumors and cell lines. Moreover, functional dependency screens across breast cancer cell lines identified increased sensitivity of Del17p cells to genetic inhibition of AURKB, which we validated using chemical inhibition in matched breast cancer cell lines. Next, we generated an isogenic model of CAL51 breast cancer cells with/without heterozygous AURKB loss in TP53-WT and TP53-null backgrounds, and confirmed that heterozygous loss of AURKB resulted in its reduced expression and in increased sensitivity to the AURKB inhibitor barasertib. Notably, p53 inactivation increased AURKB expression and reduced drug sensitivity, as previously reported, but AURKB heterozygous knockout reverted these phenotypes, revealing opposite effects of common modes of p53 inactivation (Del17p vs. point mutations). Mechanistically, the phenotypes associated with barasertib treatment - mitotic aberrations, cytokinesis failure, whole-genome doubling and apoptosis - were exacerbated in Del17p cells. Our findings therefore suggest Del17p as a potential biomarker for identifying breast cancer patients who may benefit from AURKB inhibition and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in Del17p breast tumors.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In Wm82, P. sojae hyphae proliferate in outer tissues but are excluded from the stele, exhibiting negative tropism toward the pericycle. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that resistance in Wm82 involves an infection-induced pericycle state transcriptionally enriched for systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and flavonoid biosynthetic genes, including GmCHS7 and GmCHI4A. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of these genes compromised resistance, whereas overexpression enhanced immunity in the susceptible Wm background. Metabolomic and spatial metabolic analyses identified naringenin, a flavonoid phytoalexin, as a key antimicrobial compound that specifically accumulates in pericycle-adjacent tissues of Wm82 during infection. Naringenin directly inhibited the hyphal growth of multiple P. sojae races in vitro and enhanced host resistance when applied exogenously. Spatial metabolite mapping further revealed a pattern switch in Wm82 from a uniform naringenin distribution to a pericycle-enriched ring structure upon infection, a transition absent in Wm where naringenin was undetectable post infection. Together, these findings uncover a spatially targeted immune strategy in which pericycle-localized flavonoid accumulation establishes a chemical barrier that safeguards vascular integrity. This work highlights pericycle-centered metabolic immunity as a promising strategy for engineering durable, tissue-specific resistance against root-invading pathogens.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a simple classifier that accurately distinguishes PAGs from other gene models based on evolutionary and sequence-derived genomic features, achieving an ROC-AUC of 0.87. Remarkably, a model trained solely on maize data gave statistically significant and biologically meaningful results for two evolutionarily distant angiosperms with divergent genome architectures, rice (Oryza sativa) and arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Gene models predicted to have a higher probability of being PAGs displayed patterns consistent with known biological properties of essential genes, and newly identified PAGs received significantly higher prediction scores than non-validated gene models. Notably, the predicted PAGs were not confined to well-characterized gene families or genes with known domain functions. The quantitative scores generated by this model offer a valuable resource for prioritizing and exploring the vast number of uncharacterized gene models in maize and other plants, potentially accelerating gene discovery and functional annotation in crops.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

K.; Maurya, B.; Mukherjee, A.; Mutsuddi, M.", "abstract": "A deeper understanding of neurodegenerative disorders at the level of genetic or environmental risk factors as well as contributing genes, pathways, and networks suggests the presence of shared molecular mechanisms. Previously, we have reported that the KH domain of the Spoonbill protein alone can suppress non-coding Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8 (SCA8) associated neurodegeneration. In the current study, we have identified dLarp7 as a novel interacting partner of Spoonbill in Drosophila. Mammalian Larp7 is associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder, Alazami Syndrome (AS). In this study, we report that dLarp7 protein is recruited into the pathogenic SCA8 RNA foci, which leads to depletion of its downstream target, 7SKsnRNA. Soaking away of Larp7 into toxic RNA foci results in its depletion from the physiological pool resulting in destabilization and depletion of 7SKsnRNP. Hence, increasing the dose of dLarp7 suppressed SCA8 associated neurodegeneration, by restoring the physiological levels of dLarp7 and 7SKsnRNP. In addition, it was observed that dLarp7 interacts with the somatic motor neuron (SMN) protein which is associated with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This observation led us to explore the interaction of Drosophila SMN1 orthologue with pathogenic SCA8 associated neurodegeneration. Intriguingly, SMN protein modulated molecular neuropathogenesis associated with SCA8. The presence of orthologues of Drosophila RNA binding proteins, dLarp7 and SMN, with mammalian counterparts underlines the translational importance of our findings. Our study also hints at the shared molecular mechanisms that underlies multiple neurodegenerative diseases. A novel association of Drosophila homologs of AS-linked Larp7 and SMA-causing SMN1 with SCA8 associated neurodegeneration suggests an overlap of molecular threads underlying the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

State transitions were differentially associated with the recruitment of these networks and manifested as either the \"easy\" or \"hard\" route, depending on the energy required for the transition. Notably, we demonstrated that the probability of specific state transitions robustly predicted inter-subject correlation within three clusters: subcortical-rich, salience/attention-rich, and DMN-rich regions.

Mitochondrial and lysosomal functional defects are hallmarks of Parkinson disease (PD). Here we uncover a novel pathway linking this dysfunctional axis to EV remodeling and immune activation. We show that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce genomic instability and micronuclei formation in PD fibroblasts, with ruptured micronuclei being sequestered into amphisomes and exported through small EVs. These EVs are enriched in oxidized mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, which potently stimulate microglial inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, this work identifies micronuclei not as passive byproducts of genome instability but as active intermediates in EV cargo loading. Importantly, treatment with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant AntiOxCIN4 elicited a mitohormetic response, enhancing ATM - mediated DNA damage repair, restoring mitochondrial dynamics, and improving lysosomal function. This reduced the incorporation of oxidized DNA into EVs and blunted their pro- inflammatory activity.

In the present comparative study, we implemented several CUMS protocols in mice that differed in the intensity and duration of stress exposure, and systematically evaluated the resulting pathophysiological and behavioural alterations associated with depressive- and anxiety-like phenotypes. We found that progressive escalation in stress intensity and frequency, as well as prolonged exposure, induced increasingly robust disease-related behavioural and physiological changes, including depression- and anxiety-like behaviours, adrenal hypertrophy, and reduced body weight gain.. Moreover, social isolation emerged as a major contributing factor exacerbating stress-induced deficits. Altogether, data suggest that a multidimensional assessment of the behavioural impairments is critical to reinforce the physiological changes indicative of a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Differences in individual stress susceptibility, stressor intensity, frequency, and housing conditions are key determinants of CUMS outcomes.

We analyzed data from 231 participants with up to three annual visits each and created five groups comprising normative controls and four HD groups according to the Huntington's Disease Integrated Staging System (HD-ISS). We found significant differences across the HD-ISS stages but not in their longitudinal change. Specifically, we found attenuated functional and effective connectivity in the caudate nucleus in HD-ISS-2, and this effect extended to other corticostriatal connections in HD-ISS-3. Overall, most of the alterations were only evident in advanced HD stages, and we did not observe widespread alterations in cortical connectivity and graph topography. Although HD-ISS groups did not differ in the amount of in-scanner motion, we did find measures of functional and effective connectivity to be sensitive to motion. We conclude that fMRI can indeed capture attenuation of cortico-striatal functional and effective connectivity across HD progression.

Subcutaneous injection of tianeptine (10 & 30 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent increase in hippocampal beta-frequency activity and a modest increase in fEPSP slope that were blocked by the opioid-receptor antagonist naloxone. Injection of the opioid buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) had similar effects, but ketamine (10 mg/kg), another atypical antidepressant, caused a distinct pattern of LFP changes characterised by a naloxone-insensitive increase in slow-gamma activity. Injection of 30 mg/kg tianeptine and buprenorphine was associated with an increase in brain temperature of ~0.6 degrees C, sufficient to fully explain the increase in fEPSP slope, but not the increase in LFP activity. Injection of tianeptine also caused a reduction in the amplitude of the inhibitory tail of the fEPSP, consistent with a blockade of feedforward inhibition. These results indicate that tianeptine, like several other atypical antidepressant drugs, enhances hippocampal beta/gamma-frequency LFP activity. This action is dependent on opioid-receptor activation and may depend on the disinhibition of principal neurons, a possibility that we are exploring.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated male secondary hypogonadism remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed to dissect dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis and elucidate the underlying epigenetic mechanisms using a high-fat diet mouse model. Methods: Male C57BL6 mice were fed standard chow or high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat) for 16 weeks starting from 6-week of age. Plasma testosterone levels, sperm counts, and gonadotropin responses to senktide and kisspeptin peptide stimulation were assessed. HFD-induced transcription changes in the ARC were evaluted using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq. Genome-wide changes in 5hmC were analzyed by hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (hMeDIP-seq). Functional relevance of 5hmC changes was evaluated by ectopic TET expression in an immortalized ARC Kiss1 neuron cell line and qRT-PCR. Results: HFD-fed mice induced obesity, hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance, indicative of the development of type 2 diabetes-like metabolic disorder. This was accompanied by low testosterone, reduced sperm counts, and unchanged basal LH, consistent with obesity/T2D-associated male secondary hypogonadism observed clinically. Impaired LH responses to senktide, a Kisspeptin neuron activator, but not to kisspeptin peptide, identified suppressed Kiss1 neuron function as a key mechanism underlying secondary hypogonadism. RNA-seq revealed dysregulation of metabolic and neural pathways in Kiss1 neurons. hMeDIP-seq revealed widespread 5hmC alterations in the ARC of HFD-induced obese/diabetic mice correlated with the dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism, neuronal activity, and synapse function pathways. Ectopic TET expression ex vivo in Kiss1 neuronal cell lines restored 5hmC levels and upregulated key metabolic and neuronal genes that were repressed in the ARC of DIO mice. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that Kiss1 neurons are highly sensitive to diet and metabolic changes, and that obesity/diabetes-induced 5hmC modifications play a key role in dysregulating the metabolic and neuronal pathways in Kiss1 neurons. These findings reveal a novel mechanism linking metabolic disturbances to reproductive dysfunction through direct effects on Kiss1 neurons.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

A central limitation is superposition - the entanglement of distinct semantic features along correlated directions in dense embeddings, which arises when latent features outnumber the embedding dimensions. This entanglement renders regression weights non-identifiable: different combinations of semantic directions can produce identical predicted brain activity, preventing principled interpretation of voxel selectivity. To overcome this, we introduce the Sparse Concept Encoding Model, which transforms dense embeddings into a higher-dimensional, sparse, and non-negative space of learned concept atoms. This transformation yields an axis-aligned semantic basis where each dimension corresponds to an interpretable concept, enabling direct readout of conceptual selectivity from voxel weights. When applied to fMRI data collected during story listening, our model matches the prediction performance of conventional dense models while substantially enhancing interpretability. It enables novel neuroscientific analyses such as disentangling overlapping cortical representations of time, space, and number, and revealing structured similarity among distributed conceptual maps. This framework offers a scalable and interpretable bridge between ANN-derived features and human conceptual representations in the brain.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

J.; Uchida, N.", "abstract": "Value computation is fundamental to the survival of animals. Classical models suggest value is stored in synaptic weight through plasticity whereas more recent theories propose that recurrent network dynamics can encode and update value independently of synaptic change. Although these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, the condition under which each dominates remain unclear. Here we show that environmental stability determines the neural mechanism underlying value updating. In stable environments, mice rely on synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), supporting value memory that persists for over a week. In contrast, in dynamic environments, mice gradually transition to a recurrent dynamics-based value update, with value memory degrading after ~2 minutes. A recurrent neural network (RNN) endowed with online weight updating recapitulates experimental data, exhibiting a transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value computation. Synaptic plasticity blockade in the BLA impaired initial value updating in the stable environment but not expert value updating in the dynamic environment, consistent with the RNN model. Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings and optogenetic inactivation reveal that BLA encodes both stable and dynamic value and is required for performing in both environments. Lastly, the transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value computation allowed both RNNs and mice to use task knowledge to infer value, allowing value update without direct experience. Overall, our work provides a new framework to understand value computation in the brain and suggests that meta-learning may emerge via a transition from plasticity to dynamics-based value computation.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In contrast, our current understanding of the development of this tissue is limited. The adult fat body (AFB) of Drosophila melanogaster is an emerging model for investigating the regulatory mechanisms of adipose tissue morphogenesis in vivo. AFB precursor cells undergo long-range directional and collective migration, proliferation, and homotypic adhesion, leading to the formation of monolayered AFB during metamorphosis. Here, we show that a Drosophila ADAM10 transmembrane metalloprotease, Kuzbanian (Kuz), is required for the AFB morphogenesis in the precursor cells at the onset of adhesion. Histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed that the kuz knocked-down AFB cells formed multilayered structures or clumps, indicating that Kuz is essential for forming a single-cell-thick tissue sheet. Furthermore, adults with the morphologically altered AFB were supersensitive to starvation stress. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that Notch (N), a well-characterized substrate for Kuz or ADAM10, participates in AFB development, and found that knocking down N reduced AFB area coverage and made the adults less adaptive to starvation, similar to kuz knockdown. Altogether, our study highlights the critical role of Kuz in both the architecture and function of adult adipose tissue.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Introduced to Aotearoa New Zealand from Britain in the early 1900s to aid coastal land reclamation, it became a conservation concern by the 1960s, prompting control efforts in the South Island from the 1970s. This study presents a detailed S. anglicus eradication case study from the Marlborough Sounds, where detections are nearing zero. We model changes in detection probability over time in Te Hoiere / Pelorus Sound, a complex estuarine catchment. We aim to inform control efforts and assess the effectiveness of ongoing management, by evaluating the probability of non-detection as a proxy for functional eradication. Using data from the Department of Conservation (DOC), we analysed detections across 79 search blocks between 2013 and 2024. A generalised linear mixed model was used to generate predicted detections through to 2040, using a modified dataset with pseudo-zero values for probable absences. The data were modelled as presence/absence with a binomial distribution, to identify the first year with a <0.01 probability of a positive detection (upper 99% confidence limit). Results suggest that by 2032, the likelihood of further detections under current management practices is remote, and that functional eradication may have occurred. We interpret this decline in detection probability as indicative of management success. Model outputs can support decision-making as to when active surveillance might reasonably be ceased. To accelerate the tail-end of eradication efforts, we recommend intensifying search effort and widening delimitations within the catchment over the next five years, to ensure removal of any remaining individuals.

ALAN increased M. aquaticum height and total biomass, but had no effect on native species growth. In feeding assays, P. canaliculata consumed all three native species but consistently avoided M. aquaticum under both light treatments. C. chinensis showed no feeding in no-choice assays, but in choice assays, consumed H. verticillata and M. spicatum under No-ALAN and only M. spicatum under ALAN. In community mesocosms, P. canaliculata reduced native macrophyte biomass by 48.0% under No-ALAN and 87.2% under ALAN without affecting M. aquaticum. This selective feeding increased M. aquaticum's proportional biomass, with a stronger effect under ALAN than No-ALAN.

Yet in zones of high methane flux, sulfate limitations may constrain the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) that typically perform AOM. Although often overlooked, sulfur redox intermediates are readily utilized by diverse microorganisms, potentially driving AOM in sulfate-limited zones. To resolve the microbial mechanisms underlying cryptic sulfur cycling in such sediments, Monterey Canyon cold methane seeps were investigated through an integrated geochemical, isotopic, and metatranscriptomic approach. High-resolution electrochemical measurements confirmed intense sulfide production in seep sites, and long-term anoxic incubations were conducted with sediment from the SMTZ amended with elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, or sulfate as the sole sulfur source, with or without methane. Over 650 days, sulfide accumulation was greatest in elemental sulfur treatments, followed by thiosulfate and sulfate; in all cases methane addition enhanced sulfide production. Isotopic measurements showed modest S-isotope fractionation indicating that the large fractionations typical of slow sulfate reduction were muted by additional sulfur transformations. In elemental sulfur treatments, isotopic and geochemical patterns suggested that disproportionation was unlikely. Metatranscriptomes revealed broad expression of sox genes and abundant dsr/apr across treatments, along with thiosulfate-linked phs upregulation. While ANME-2c and SEEP-SRB2 activity increased with methane, transcriptomic and isotopic data together highlighted the roles of Desulfocapsaceae, Desulfobulbaceae, and Sulfurovaceae lineages in mediating sulfur transformations. Taken together, these results demonstrate how cryptic sulfur cycling may sustain microbial communities in sulfate-depleted deep-sea sediments and contribute to AOM.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In the ovary, PGR is the key determinant of ovulation while AR and GR play important roles in growing follicles. However, the mechanism that defines the unique physiological roles of these conserved receptors, and whether their functions overlap remains elusive. We investigated the relationship between AR, GR and PGR during folliculogenesis and ovulation. In response to ovulatory hormones, PGR and GR jointly gained binding to novel chromatin sites and had a substantial effect on periovulatory gene regulation, whereas AR-chromatin interactions were repressed. Two modes of PGR action to drive gene activation were identified. Induction of PGR leads to cooperative PGR/GR recruitment to novel promoters, increased histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility, culminating in transcription activation, with PGR being the key component in the unique ovulatory transcriptional complex. Alternatively, PGR tethered to enhancers interacts with pre-accessible, AR/GR-bound promoters to promote gene activation.

However, at the population level, innovation rates can also be influenced by social and ecological factors including group size, and environmental novelty and complexity. The role of these factors are still under-explored, especially at within-city scales. To disentangle factors influencing group-level variation in innovation rates, we presented roosts of wild sulphur-crested cockatoos Cacatua galerita, with extractive-foraging tasks that required innovative problem-solving. We installed three tasks of different levels of difficulty on trees at fifteen communal roost sites across an urban matrix. We matched these with direct measures of roost-size and connectivity, and with high-resolution remote-sensing mapping to estimate variation in urbanization and environmental heterogeneity. We found that approach time was significantly associated with urbanization, with individuals in more urban sites approaching tasks more quickly, suggesting reduced neophobia with urbanization or increased familiarity with human-derived objects. In contrast, time to innovate in our study was explained by task difficulty rather than environmental and social factors. While we detected no significant effects of group size, connectivity, and environmental heterogeneity, larger sample sizes may be needed to reveal more subtle influences on innovation.

Here, we examined whether the cartilage in OA was also a source and target of TWEAK. Design: Articular cartilage samples from 24 patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery for OA were investigated for TWEAK and Fn14 expression by both immunostaining and real-time RT-PCR. Human primary chondrocytes isolated from OA cartilage were treated with combinations of recombinant TWEAK and TNF&alpha and examined for the regulation of TWEAK, FN14, RANKL, ADAM17 and SOST mRNA levels. Soluble RANKL levels were measured by ELISA. Results: TWEAK and Fn14 mRNA levels were elevated in grade 2 OA cartilage compared to grade 0 (p < 0.05). Immunostaining indicated that the majority (21/24) of OA cartilage samples expressed low levels of TWEAK protein and high levels of Fn14, however, expression did not appear to vary with respect to OA grade. Primary chondrocytes treated with TNF&alpha exhibited upregulated TWEAK and Fn14 mRNA expression. SOST mRNA expression was inhibited by both TWEAK and TNF&alpha treatment. TWEAK transiently induced RANKL mRNA expression while both TWEAK and TNF&alpha induced sRANKL release by chondrocytes.

Perturbation experiments revealed multi-whisker integration and intersubnuclear inhibition contribute to the generation of map-like tuning. These findings highlight the previously underappreciated brainstem circuit for sensory code transformation, suggesting inhibition acts as a neural comparator, subtracting peripheral inputs with differing sensitivity to transform proximity-based sensory inputs into a map-like representation of PPS.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In contrast, when activated by SPIN90, the Arp2/3 complex generates linear actin filaments. The Arp2/3 complex in mammals, consists of 8 iso-complexes with different properties as there are two isoforms of Arp3, ArpC1 and ArpC5. Here, using recombinant Arp2/3 iso-complexes with defined composition, we show that SPIN90 selectively activates ArpC5L rather than ArpC5 containing complexes to generate linear actin filaments. Consistent with this, SPIN90 at the leading edge of migrating cells enhances the recruitment of ArpC5L but not ArpC5 containing Arp2/3 complexes to lamellipodia. These SPIN90-Arp2/3-ArpC5L complexes generate linear actin filaments that integrate into lamellipodia and impact protrusion efficiency. Moreover, loss of SPIN90 leads to an enrichment in actin filaments that are more perpendicular to the plasma membrane. Our results demonstrate that SPIN90 regulates the architecture and dynamics of lamellipodial actin in an Arp2/3 iso-complex dependent fashion.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Among these is KDM6A (UTX), an X-linked histone demethylase recently found to be commonly mutated in patients with heart failure. The mechanistic implications of KDM6A mutations in cardiac dysfunction remain largely unknown. Here, using multi-omics profiling and functional characterisation of murine models and patient-derived data, we demonstrate that haematopoietic loss of KDM6A substantially impairs cardiac recovery following myocardial infarction (MI). KDM6A deficiency enhances systemic and cardiac inflammation, characterized by augmented myeloid cell infiltration into the infarcted murine heart. Single-cell chromatin accessibility and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed profound epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming in KDM6A-deficient myeloid cells, notably CCR2 recruited macrophages and neutrophils. These cells exhibited heightened inflammatory (Il1b, Nlpr3, Saa3) and chemotactic signatures (Ccr2, Mif, Cxcl12), increased activation of inflammatory transcription factor networks (AP-1, C/EBP), disrupted chromatin architecture, and enhanced glycolytic activity. Clinically, patients with heart failure harbouring KDM6A-driven CH exhibited increased pro-inflammatory monocyte signatures (CCR2, NLPR3, NFKB1, FOS, JUN, IL6R, IL32), underscoring the translational relevance. Integrative analyses further predicted pathogenic crosstalk between KDM6A-mutated monocytes and cardiac resident cells and was experimentally validated by demonstrating that KDM6A-silenced macrophages drive cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibroblast activation. Our findings establish a critical mechanistic link between KDM6A-driven CH, immune dysregulation, and worsened cardiac outcomes post-MI, highlighting novel avenues for personalized therapeutic strategies in heart failure.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

However, Wee1 inhibitors have efficacy in TP53 wild-type tumours and many trials have been terminated due to high levels of toxic side-effects, suggesting that Wee1 has unknown functions. Here, we show that Wee1 promotes cell cycle re-entry from quiescence (G0) by opposing the activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, APC/CCdh1. Wee1 phosphorylates Cdh1 (FZR1) at key residues that mediate the interaction between Cdh1 and APC/C. Cells with loss-of-function of Wee1 during G0/G1 have delayed S-phase entry, an impaired G1/S transition, abnormal S-phase accumulation of the CDK inhibitor p21 and enter a p21-dependent G2 arrest. Reduced expression of APC/CCdh1 or p21 renders cells more sensitive to acute Wee1 inhibition and both pathways are downregulated in acquired Wee1 inhibitor resistance.

The length of the HOC phase is fixed and its frequency is nutrient-dependent but the nature of the HOC to LOC transition is poorly defined. Here, we use a multimodal latent-space regression framework to study the cross-talk among metabolic, chromatin and transcriptional changes during the YMC. Our model reveals that both the HOC-LOC and LOC-HOC phase transitions in the YMC are coordinated by accumulating metabolites, reflecting cellular energetics and redox state.

Following injury, Nes+ Bg increase in number due to upregulation of Nes in Hopx-expressing Bg, but the cells exhibit limited regeneration.

Their complex, long-lived life history presents challenges to understanding their population dynamics that we endeavor to overcome through the use of both reduced- representation sequencing and whole-genome resequencing data from fish across different cohorts. Our unique sample set allowed us to compare genomic structure, diversity, and demographic changes between cohorts born before and after the year 2000, when changes to fisheries management practices in the Southern Ocean reduced incidences of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. While our population structure analyses corroborate recent studies showing panmixia across circumpolar populations of D. mawsoni, comparisons between cohorts revealed key exceptions. A lack of admixture in fish born before 2000 contrasted with widespread admixture among post-2000 individuals, consistent with increased mixing and/or genotype influx. Concernedly, genome-wide diversity declined over time in the Ross Sea (management area 88), with the significant losses observed in heterozygosity between pre-2000 and post-2000 cohorts. Elevated levels of inbreeding in the Ross Sea, coupled with evidence for recent population contraction from positive Tajima's D values, provided potential explanations for the observed reductions in genomic diversity. Our results reconcile circumpolar panmixia with localized erosion of diversity and elevated inbreeding in the Ross Sea sector, underscoring the value of temporal monitoring and the need to prioritize future research on the interplay between fisheries pressure and environmental change in driving population dynamics and genomic structure in toothfish.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Understanding WNV circulation in diverse mosquito populations is critical for predicting and mitigating outbreaks. This study investigated mosquito populations from coastal Kenya, where WNV was detected, genetically characterized, and evidence of transovarial transmission in Aedes aegypti was observed. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected from Kwale, Kilifi, Mombasa, and Isiolo counties (n=14,105) and pooled by species and location (1,596 pools). Pools were inoculated on Vero E6 cells, followed by RNA extraction, Illumina MiSeq sequencing, and preliminary analysis on CZ-ID. Reads were quality-controlled (PrinseqLite v0.20.4), assembled de novo (MEGAHIT v1.2.9), and analyzed via BLAST. Phylogenetic reconstruction used Maximum Likelihood, and codon-level selection pressure was evaluated using FEL, MEME, and FUBAR on Datamonkey. Results: WNV was detected in ten pools: eight Lineage 1a and two Lineage 2. Virus isolates came from Culex pipiens, Culex univittatus, Anopheles funestus, Aedes aegypti, and Eretmapodites chrysogaster. Notably, one Lineage 1a isolate from a male Aedes aegypti confirmed transovarial transmission. Six codons were under diversifying selection, NS2B gene was found to carry the V103A mutation. Conclusion: WNV in coastal Kenyan mosquitoes revealed transovarial transmission in Aedes aegypti. Lineage-specific evolution, codons under positive selection, and the NS2B:V103A mutation demonstrate ongoing viral adaptation.

Across nine task conditions, groups including a human consistently underperformed relative to groups composed solely of artificial agents.

Moreover, this signaling pathway regulates several cellular functions including differentiation, cell division, angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and cell migration. However, studies suggest that an uncontrolled activation of TGF-{beta} signaling may contribute to many human diseases. Therefore, counter-regulatory mechanism(s) to restrain abrupt TGF-{beta} activation during cellular homeostasis is necessary to maintain an adequate balance of TGF-{beta} downstream signaling. TGF-{beta} through Smad complex activation causes transcriptional regulation of many transcription factors including Snail which act as an immediate-early response gene in TGF-{beta} signaling. Herein, for the first time, we report that Splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ), an RNA binding paraspeckles-associated protein works as a transcriptional repressor of Snail. We first confirmed a significant reduction in the expression level of SFPQ in the kidney glomeruli of rats that underwent subtotal nephrectomy. Endothelial cells (EC) treated with TGF-{beta} exhibited loss of SFPQ protein level without altering its transcript level. Inhibition of proteasomal or autophagosome-lysosome pathway revealed ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation of SFPQ upon TGF-{beta} challenge. Prior to degradation, TGF-{beta} treatment resulted in the cytosolic export of SFPQ thereby diminishing nuclear SFPQ level. Knockdown of SFPQ augmented TGF-{beta}-dependent increase in Snail level while overexpression of SFPQ reversed TGF-{beta} induced Snail expression. Although SFPQ exhibited association with many transcription factors including Smad2/3, Smad4, and N1-ICD which regulate Snail gene expression, TGF-{beta} failed to alter the association of SFPQ with these transcription factors. Instead, through ChIP-qPCR analysis, we confirmed the enrichment of SFPQ in E-box promoter region and coding region proximal to TSS of the Snail gene.

Probe-level methylation is aggregated into CpG-island features, and RNA-seq is reduced to high-variance genes, yielding compact inputs for modality-specific MLP encoders. A BERT-like transformer with masked reconstruction and cross-modal prediction objectives learns a shared embedding space that supports missing-modality inputs. We evaluate the learned representations in two zero-shot settings: (i) cancer-type classification using a linear probe on frozen embeddings, and (ii) mutation prediction for 214 genes using a shallow MLP. The model achieves high performance for many tumor types and gene-cancer pairs without encoder fine-tuning.

Despite various lines of evidence that ecDNA promotes aggressive disease, the mechanisms and selective pressures leading to ecDNA formation and propagation remain poorly understood as are their structures.

This acetylated derivative of L-leucine functions as a pro-drug, with the acetyl group rendering it a substrate for the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family of transporters to allow appreciable penetration of the blood-brain barrier and its efficient uptake into cells (Churchill et al., 2021). Inside cells, levacetylleucine undergoes metabolism catalysed by acylases, and the resultant high quantities of L-leucine enter metabolic pathways which enhance mitochondrial bioenergetics and, as previously demonstrated, indirectly ameliorate lysosomal function (Kaya et al., 2020). Here, we show a novel aspect of levacetylleucine mechanism of action, demonstrating a direct effect on lysosomal function through its rapid modulation of the translocation of the transcription factor TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenic and autophagic genes (Napolitano and Ballabio, 2016), from cytoplasm to nucleus. Uniquely, we have demonstrated a biphasic action whereby levacetylleucine normalizes TFEB activity, consistent with levacetylleucine previously shown ability to regulate cellular homeostasis: in wild-type HeLa cells, levacetylleucine enhances and activates the translocation of TFEB to the nucleus. In contrast, in cellular models of NPC type 1 disease, where TFEB is already over-expressed in the nucleus (as the cell attempts to compensate for the primary defect by activating TFEB as a natural cellular response to the lysosomal substrate accumulation and associated cellular stress), treatment with levacetylleucine down-regulates and restores the distribution of TFEB to a more normalized cytoplasmic: nuclear ratio. Importantly, both effects of levacetylleucine occur at concentrations consistent with plasma concentrations in therapeutic dosing (Churchill et al., 2020). The effects were also confirmed to be stereospecific to the L-enantiomer, as neither the D-enantiomer (N-acetyl-D-leucine) or racemate (N-acetyl-DL-leucine) had any effect, The presence of the D-enantiomer in the racemic mixture inhibited the ability of levacetylleucine to promote TFEB bidirectional translocation, consistent with previous studies, which have established antagonism of N-acetyl-L-leucine by N-acetyl-D-leucine in the racemic mixture (rendering the racemic mixture without effect). This bidirectional mechanism of action of levacetylleucine to impact lysosomal function directly and normalize, either by activating basal TFEB signalling or reducing aberrant TFEB function in NPC1 knockout cells, thereby modulating lysosomal and autophagic functions, lends itself to the treatment of a broad range of neurological and neurodevelopment disorders.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

By wirelessly recorded neural activity from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of macaque monkeys trained on orthographic tasks over five successive days, we indeed discovered IT neurons tuned to letters and sensitive to either ordinal or retinotopic positions.

Conclusion: Our results show that anti-MDA5+ B cells recognize the helicase domains, which are the enzymatically active domains of the protein. These results have implications for understanding the etiopathology of anti-MDA5+ DM and development of new antigen-specific therapies.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

The function of CD74, originally described as an MHC-II chaperone and receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor, remains poorly understood in tumor immunity. In this study, we show that systemic CD74 deletion in a syngeneic melanoma model significantly delayed tumor growth and reshaped the tumor immune microenvironment. Tumors in Cd74-/- mice had more effector and memory CD8+ T cells producing IFN-{gamma} and granzyme B than in control mice. Loss of CD74 promoted expansion of migratory cDC1s with elevated MHC-I and CCR7 expression. Cd74-/- professional antigen presenting cells increased cross-priming capacity for tumor-derived antigens in vivo and in vitro. Absence of CD74 induced the expression of CCR7, a key lymph node homing molecule, on cDCs and enhanced their ability to migrate towards the CCL19 ligand in single cell tracking analyses. These findings identify CD74 as a regulator of dendritic cell function and a promising therapeutic target to improve melanoma immunogenicity.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

A.; Santin, I.", "abstract": "Aims/hypothesis: Genome-wide association studies increasingly highlight the role of non-coding regions in complex diseases such as type 1 diabetes, pointing, in particular, to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potentially active molecular players. Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs may encode (small) peptides with the potential to modulate cellular processes, including immune responses. In this study, we have investigated whether these (micro)peptides translated from lncRNAs can act as neoantigens capable of activating autoreactive CD4 T cells in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We have integrated transcriptomic, proteomic and in silico data to identify a subset of lncRNAs with genuine peptide-coding potential in basal or inflamed-condition beta cells. We further assessed the suitability of those candidates to encode (micro)peptides by sequence analysis and in vitro experimentation techniques. Finally, we have predicted HLA-II epitopes within the micropeptide candidates and evaluated their immunogenicity by analyzing T cell activation responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA matching individuals with type 1 diabetes. Results: By merging ribosome-bound RNA sequencing with nascent peptide mass spectrometry, we identified a total of 30 lncRNAs with potential coding capacity. We verified the peptide-coding ORF translation for three lncRNA candidates: UXT-AS1, RAPGEF4-AS1 and ENSG00000227066. After predicting potential type 1 diabetes risk-associated HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-DRB1*04:01-binding epitopes within translated lncRNA (micro)peptides, we identified several peptides that elicited CD4+ T cell activation. Furthermore, several epitopes elicited T cell activation in multiple donors with type 1 diabetes. T cell lines were isolated and studied to confirm responses restricted by type 1 diabetes risk HLA alleles. Conclusions: These results reveal a novel class of immunogenic (micro)peptides derived from lncRNAs, supporting their potential role in the autoimmune response that underlies type 1 diabetes. Our findings open new perspectives on the contribution of non-coding genomic elements to autoimmunity and highlight the need to further investigate lncRNA-encoded (micro)peptides as possible targets for future immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Our goal is to describe the bacterial communities across the groundwater-dependent ecosystems on Lanzarote, spanning a gradient of anthropogenic pollution using 16SrRNA amplicon sequencing. We sampled coastal caves and pools, wells and water galleries, springs, saltworks and marine bays affected by submarine groundwater discharge. Ecological analyses highlight that richness and composition of bacterial communities strongly depend on the type of habitats. Pathogens and human-derived species were ubiquitous in our samples, but, strikingly, caves and wells were strongly enriched with them compared to other habitats. We propose that our results highlight the susceptibility of groundwater environments to pollution and indicate that aquifers act as reservoirs of biological contamination in addition to natural diversity, regardless of their salinity. Since this enrichment might compromise some of the functions and services that groundwater-dependent ecosystems provide in oceanic islands, we call for integrative conservation strategies that include hydrological and biological perspectives into the decision making.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Efforts to build genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have revealed several unifying rules: epistasis is pervasive, fitness effects are not normally distributed, and the GP map is non-linear and complicated for high-level phenotypes. A critical step in developing GP maps is evaluating how well predictive models do in explaining observed phenotypes. We utilize the simplicity of a bacteriophage ({Phi}X174) study system to test if an intermediate phenotype (predicted stability of the G capsid protein) explains more complex phenotypes. In doing so, we compare the predictive performance of free energies of folding and binding obtained using numerous molecular modeling methods as well as phylogenetic and basic biochemical/biophysical properties of amino acid substitutions. By creating a large mutational library, we find that {Phi}X174 tolerates about 50% of the amino acid substitutions we inserted into the G protein and that molecular modeling compliments other substitution models for predicting viability. Mutations predicted to have large destabilizing effects are especially informative and are almost universally detrimental. These large-effect substitutions often coincide with the most conserved residues in the G protein. Apart from large-effect mutations, our ability to predict {Phi}X174 phenotypes is fairly poor and we explore various potential confounding factors (e.g., codon bias) that could be considered to improve viability predictions.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

To counteract this host response, viruses have developed a broad spectrum of strategies to inhibit SG formation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying SG inhibition remain poorly understood. The nucleocapsid proteins play a critical role in virus replication and host interaction. Here, using Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) as a model, we uncover the function of the alphavirus nucleocapsid in SG inhibition. Oligomerization mediated by -helix coupled with a positively charged IDR in the N-terminal of capsid is essential for SG inhibition. SFV capsid can directly compete with G3BP1 for RNA binding, thus inhibiting G3BP1-RNA liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro and SG formation in cells. Expanding the scope, we discover that this SG inhibition mechanism is a shared feature among all members of the alphavirus family, yet distinct from SARS-CoV-2 capsid and not observed in other endemic viruses. Expression of SFV capsid-derived peptide is sufficient to inhibit ALS-mutation-induced SG formation, suggesting a potential for tackling ALS. Thus, this study provides mechanistic insight into SG modulation by the viral capsid protein and offers a possible bioengineering tool for dissecting SG dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

However, it is well known that the preparation technique of complex environmental samples for bioanalytical testing could have huge impact on the composition of exposure solutions and hence the corresponding toxicity Considering this, it is important to develop reliable environmental sample preparation procedures to obtain accurate and reproducible results in the zebrafish embryo toxicity studies. In the present study, we aimed to investigate how different experimental set-ups using a Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) extract of a complex water sample might influence the toxicity assessment using embryos of Danio rerio. Firstly, we assess the influence of two typical carrier solvents (methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide) for dosing environmental extracts. We further investigated the effect of increasing exposure media pH. Finally, we studied the effect of the SPE blank on lethal and sublethal effects in embryos of Danio rerio. Although no significant differences were observed for different solvents, we observed an adverse effect on hatching rate when testing the blank. This indicates the potential impact of background contamination in experimental setups, highlighting the need for appropriate blank correction methods. Furthermore, the differential effects observed with different pH correction methods highlight the importance of carefully selecting the appropriate pH adjustment strategy to accurately assess toxicity levels.

Monitoring their biodiversity is essential but challenging due to their dynamic nature and the transient presence of many species. Traditionally actinopterygian monitoring in these systems still relies on conventional and intrusive methods such as gill nets and trawls. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offers a non-invasive, multi-taxa alternative that can complement these traditional approaches. Here, we applied an eDNA-based metabarcoding approach to characterize vertebrate diversity in the Rance Estuary, located in the Brittany Region of France. Water samples were collected from five stations spanning marine to freshwater environments. Special attention was given to two stations located upstream and downstream of the tidal power plant (TPP) dam to assess its potential impact on ecological continuity. We detected a total of 124 distinct vertebrate MOTUs, comprising actinopterygians, birds, mammals, and amphibians. Taxonomic composition followed the estuarine gradient, with Jaccard dissimilarity increasing with distance from the sea and largely driven by species turnover. While taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity remained relatively stable across the vertebrate community, functional diversity revealed an increasing terrestrial influence. For actinopterygians, taxonomic diversity decreased upstream, whereas phylogenetic and functional diversity indicated fine-scale structuring, even among nearby stations. This approach enabled the development of biodiversity metrics and facilitated comparisons with previous actinopterygian monitoring surveys in the same area based on conventional methods (scientific fishing using nets and dredges).

Here, we present genomic evidence of this recoding in a third bacterial phylum, the Actinomycetota, specifically in the family Eggerthellaceae. We identify the UGA stop-to-tryptophan recoding in 34 metagenome-assembled genomes recovered from the stool samples of diverse mammalian hosts, including equids and primates. Canonical markers for this recoding are consistently observed including conserved UGA codons aligning to tryptophan, loss of release factor 2 (prfB), and presence of a tRNATrp(UCA) gene. We infer that this recoding occurred at least twice as the lineages containing recoded genomes are paraphyletic, forming two distinct groups separated by a third lineage with strains that continue to use UGA as a stop codon. These lineages represent three new Eggerthellaceae genera for which we propose the type species Equivita altericodex, Gorillivita intestinalis, and Tapirivita inops reflecting isolation source and genomic properties. Genomes representing these genera, including the non-recoded Tapirivita lineage, have reduced genomes and complete or partial loss of biosynthetic pathways, suggesting a transition to obligate symbiosis. Increasing host dependency may have facilitated stop codon reassignment in Equivita and Gorillivita species. This work expands the known phylogenetic diversity of UGA stop-to-tryptophan reassignment in the bacterial domain and establishes the Eggerthellaceae as a new focal point for understanding the evolutionary drivers of genetic code plasticity.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Enviromics, by integrating environmental covariates into predictive models, offers a way to overcome these limitations and guide clonal deployment. This study evaluated an enviromic framework applied to 15 Eucalyptus spp. clones across 5,189 inventory plots located in southern Brazil. 10,000 Engineered Enviromic Markers (EEMs) were built from 3,869 soil, climate, and remote sensing covariates, using random forest and integrated into a mixed-model ensemble to predict mean annual increment standardized at seven years (MAI7) across the Target Population of Environments (TPE). Predictive accuracy was assessed through a Leave-One-Region-Out cross-validation procedure. The enviromic model achieved a higher performance than a baseline GxE model, with Pearson and Spearman correlations above 0.90 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.09, compared to 0.45 to 0.39 correlations and RMSE of 8.73 for the baseline. Spatial predictions enabled the delineation of breeding zones that minimized GxE, while also revealing regions with high discriminant power for testing new genotypes. We also applied a two-step clonal deployment procedure combining enviromic predictions with a frost-risk penalization map, refining recommendations for frost-prone areas. When comparing recommended versus planted clones in inventory plots, the framework indicated an average expected productivity gain of 13.4%.

Multiplexed assays of variant effects (MAVE) experiments serve as a rich data source, but cannot deliver enough data for training truly large neural-net models. Therefore, zero-shot methods, for example protein language models, have increasingly gained popularity. For these methods, MAVE results serve primarily for evaluation purposes, as exemplified by the ProteinGym benchmark. In this study, we argue that the rapidly increasing amounts of MAVE data can be used to train efficient supervised methods, presenting our new tool StructGuy, based on gradient boosting trees methodology. In contrast to other supervised methods in the field, StructGuy, thanks to its dedicated training dataset and data leakage-free training process, can predict variant effects for proteins not seen during training. To evaluate this generalization ability, we constructed a dedicated benchmark and compared StructGuy with zero-shot methods from the ProteinGym leaderboard achieving a competitive performance.

We found that proliferation events promoted local velocity of glioblastoma cell lines, but had only a small effect on large spatial scales. Furthermore, two phenotypes were found when subjecting glioblastoma cells to cell density gradient. One phenotype was characterized by the active migration of cells, independent of proliferation, while the other was mostly driven by cell proliferation. Lastly, the analysis of effects of an overall increasing cell density demonstrated that cells showing signs of self-organization, forming liquid-like structures, are able to escape the expected cell-density induced migratory arrest. Notably, the emergence of small-scale order was associated with a promotion of cellular migration, even in cell cultures that were largely in state of migratory arrest.

After finding that MYCN is required for P3F-induced oncogenic transformation in a human myoblast model of FP-RMS, we further investigated the role of Myc family proteins in FP-RMS. Expression studies revealed that myoblast models and a subset of FP-RMS lines have predominant MYCN or MYC expression whereas other FP-RMS lines have both high MYCN and MYC expression. In myoblast models, MYCN was required for optimal P3F binding to and high-level activation of FGF8, a P3F target that is necessary and sufficient for oncogenic transformation. MYCN or MYC knockdown suppressed transformation in myoblast and FP-RMS lines with dominant MYCN or MYC expression, respectively. In FP-RMS lines with high MYCN and MYC expression, there was partial loss of transformation when one gene was targeted and complete loss when both genes were targeted. Despite the loss of oncogenic activity in lines with knockdown of a dominant Myc family member, FGF8 expression was not decreased. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that P3F target genes were not affected by MYCN or MYC knockdown, and instead a group of Myc-specific targets was down-regulated. Collectively, these results indicate that MYCN or MYC is functionally dominant in myoblast models and FP-RMS lines with dominant expression of one Myc family protein whereas MYCN and MYC are functionally redundant in FP-RMS cell lines with high expression of both.

To identify urinary proteomic signatures associated with subclinical AKD of differing etiologies, we induced AKI in Wistar rats using either toxic (cisplatin-induced) or ischemic (unilateral ischaemia-reperfusion, I/R) models, and monitored renal function, renal histopathology and urine composition over 42 days. Renal function, as assessed by pCr and creatinine clearance, was rapidly and severely impaired following treatment with cisplatin and I/R, and normalized afterwards within 10 and 2 days, respectively. Despite functional recovery, histological analysis revealed persistent tissue injury, characterized by tubular dilation, necrosis, inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis, particularly in cisplatin-treated animals at day 42. Urinary proteomic analysis identified 53 and 23 proteins that were differentially excreted with the urine in the cisplatin and I/R groups, respectively, compared to controls, and 11 proteins differed from one AKI etiology to the other. Additionally, 29 proteins appeared exclusively post-AKI, irrespective of cause. Most of these proteins are predominantly involved in the immune response, complement activation, haemostasis, and gluconeogenesis. These findings suggest that urinary proteomic fingerprints may serve as sensitive indicators of subclinical AKD, reflecting underlying structural damage even in the absence of overt functional impairment.

However, only recently there is evidence emerging that SA impacts growth processes independently of nuclear auxin signalling, possessing yet unknown mechanistic functions. Here we show that SA activity depends on TRANSMEMBRANE KINASE 1 (TMK1) resulting in apoplast alkalinization and growth restriction.

These features provide a comprehensive description of synaptic dynamics, allowing the simulation of plasticity at both the cellular and the network levels. Overall, the model offers a valuable framework for studying NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD by explicitly incorporating AMPA currents. We believe that this model provides deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and paves the way for the construction of network-level models by linking multiple cells through AMPA receptor conductance.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

J.; Werner, R.; Drijvers, L.; Selen, L.; Pouw, W.", "abstract": "In a landmark paper in JASA, Orlikoff & Baken (1989a) demonstrated that the heartbeat echoes through acoustic features of the human voice. Heart-voice coupling questions how vocal control is functionally regulated under these perturbations. It has many potential engineering applications that extract heart rate from human voice and speech, with underutilized potential for cardiac monitoring from (wild) animal calls. However, laboratory phonology and bioacoustics seem to have forgotten about the phenomenon, such that the physiological underpinnings of heart-voice coupling have been left unexplained. In the current contribution, we show that vocal acoustics contain signatures of the heartbeat as originally reported by Orlikoff & Baken (1989a). More specifically, we analysed the steady-state vowel vocalizations of 17 participants and found a significant relationship between the vocal amplitude envelope and the cardiac activity (ECG). Furthermore, we conducted two empirical tests to dissociate between glottal (vocal fold vascularization) and subglottal (heart-lung interaction) mechanisms of heart-voice coupling. In addition to a stable heart-voice coupling, we also found a significant heart-expiration coupling during conditions of pure expiration. Since the vocal folds are abducted during expiration, this result demonstrates that subglottal mechanisms that modulate expiratory flow must be involved in heart-voice coupling. We argue that the heart rhythm needs to be considered as a weakly coupled pattern generator that possibly shaped the evolution of vocal and speech production.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Extracting knowledge across all these experiences about what type of events to expect in a certain environment leads to event schemas being represented in the brain. These event schemas help to predict future events. What are the differences across the various distinct hippocampal subfields in peaks of activity around event boundaries? And what is the influence of event schema learning on these hippocampal subfield peaks? Here, this was investigated using data from an fMRI experiment in which participants learned two (related) event schemas by exposure to many similar animated videos of wedding ceremonies in a novel fictional culture. Results revealed that the hippocampus (CA1, CA2/3, dentate gyrus and subiculum) showed peaks in activity before event boundaries. Interestingly, the CA1, CA2/3 and dentate gyrus pre-boundary peaks attenuated due to event schema learning. This provides evidence for these subfields signaling uncertainty about upcoming events in the seconds prior to event boundaries. These results give a more precise understanding about the temporal dynamics around event boundaries in the distinct hippocampal subfields, and how these hippocampal subfields' responses interact with schema learning.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

We found that FET family proteins (FUS, EWS, and TAF15) are recruited to replication forks in a PAR-dependent manner, forming condensates that slow fork progression and promote fork reversal. FET proteins control fork dynamics in response to some, but not all, replication stresses. FUS inactivation leads to unrestrained fork progression via RECQ1 and PRIMPOL, increased single-stranded DNA gaps, genome instability, and synthetic lethality with BRCA1 deficiency.

Radiation generates double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are frequently misrepaired, giving rise to micronuclei and chromosome bridges: abnormal nuclear structures known to drive chromosomal instability. Here, a modified live-cell imaging and single-cell whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approach was used to directly connect early cytological responses to genome-wide outcomes in cells exposed to graded IR doses. Tracking asynchronously cycling cells revealed that micronuclei, chromosome bridges, and nuclear fragmentation form at high frequency during the first mitosis after irradiation, in a strongly cell-cycle-dependent manner: micronuclei were most frequent after S-phase irradiation, whereas chromosome bridges predominated when damage occurred in G1 or S phase. Lineage tracing combined with clonogenic assays showed that formation of abnormal nuclear structures in the first post-irradiation division is a major determinant of long-term proliferative capacity, with centromere-containing (centric) fragments and bridges exerting a stronger anti-proliferative effect than acentric micronuclei. Single-cell WGS of daughter and granddaughter cells demonstrated that these structures generate reciprocal copy-number changes, clustered rearrangements, and chromothripsis-like events that are largely incompatible with sustained proliferation. In contrast, bulk WGS of surviving single-cell-derived clones revealed only modest increases in single-nucleotide variants and indels but an enrichment of nonhomologous end-joining associated deletion signatures and selected structural variants, including amplification of a pre-existing 12p gain. These findings identify abnormal nuclear structures as key intermediates linking IR-induced DNA lesions to mitotic catastrophe and provide insight into selective tolerance of specific rearrangements.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

This process requires precise regulation of interactions between Adherens Junctions (AJs) and the cortical actin network to generate the necessary mechanical forces.

Here, we show that Vinculin and Ajuba LIM protein, two key regulators of mechano-transduction and cell adhesion, do not localise to AJs of DBs, while the cytoskeletal adaptor Girdin does. We demonstrate that Girdin's function relies on AJ components a-Catenin and E-Cadherin and is specifically required in tracheal cells to ensure the proper pace of cell intercalation. In addition, Girdin contributes to the actin network enrichment at AJs. Its role as an integral AJ component is further elucidated through the development of a novel genetic tool enabling in vivo cell-specific actin depolymerisation.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

M.; Bonada, N.; Cid, N.", "abstract": "Incorporating metacommunity perspectives into bioassessment represents a major challenge in the management of drying river networks, where drying-induced fragmentation compromises the performance of biological indices to assess their ecological status. Indeed, current indices focus on local community responses to stressors and neglect the effect of regional processes, such as spatiotemporal connectivity and dispersal, on metacommunity assembly. In this work, we explored the effect of drying on the performance of a widely used biological index using metacommunity simulations on a synthetic drying river network. We assessed how different gradients of drying-driven fragmentation and human impact extent determine local richness and the biological index scores by combining simulations with biomonitoring information. We used a coalescent metacommunity model to simulate the exchange of individuals between local communities along synthetic drying river networks. These networks were subjected to different drying extent, drying intensity and human impact extent scenarios. Additionally, we considered two major characteristics for each simulated taxon: (i) tolerance to human impacts and (ii) dispersal strategy (flying, swimming, or drifting). For each simulation, we obtained local richness and the biological index value. Then, we calculated biological index performance, which we defined as the capacity to distinguish between impacted and non-impacted sites. Finally, we tested our approach in six non-impacted European drying river networks, from which drying information was available. Our results showed that low spatiotemporal connectivity consistently led to decreased local richness and low scores of the biological index (reflecting poor biological quality). As drying extent and intensity increased, drying-induced fragmentation significantly reduced the biological index performance. For example, with a 50% increase in drying extent, index performance fell over 70% and at high drying levels, this performance dropped more than 90%. This decay followed a convex pattern, with a marked drop in performance as soon as drying appeared in the catchment and leveling off at higher drying extents.

Deoxygenation is a rapidly intensifying yet underrecognized threat to coral reefs that interacts with heat and acidification to alter coral physiology and stress resilience. However, the effects of hypoxia-related compound events on corals are largely unknown, underscoring the need for multi-stressor studies. Here, we conducted two extended-exposure experiments (12-17 days) across the coral species Porites furcata, Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea, to disentangle the individual and combined effects of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) with either heat or acidification. We measured eight phenotypic traits related to growth, metabolism, and symbiosis health to test whether hypoxia imposes energetic constraints or other physiological stress that amplify the effects of heat or acidification. Standardized effect size analysis across 24 stressor-trait combinations revealed 13 additive, 10 synergistic, and only one antagonistic response. Hypoxia consistently suppressed dark respiration by 37-49% across species and altered photophysiology in the two Porites species, whereas acidification alone had minimal effects, particularly in S. siderea. Heat stress caused the most pronounced declines across nearly all traits, and when combined with hypoxia, it produced the highest number of synergistic interactions. In contrast, the combination of hypoxia and acidification largely resulted in additive responses, suggesting that independent physiological mechanisms underlie these effects. All corals showed strong metabolic depression under hypoxia which is likely beneficial as a short-term adaptive response but may impose energetic constraints in the long-term. These findings highlight deoxygenation as critical yet often overlooked drivers of coral reef vulnerability. More multi-stressor experiments across a range of species are urgently needed to improve predictions of reef resilience under future ocean conditions, where compound stress events are expected to become more frequent and severe.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "The exquisite eggshell mimicry found in many cuckoo-host systems has been the textbook example of a coevolutionary arms race [1]. In this system, cuckoos lay their eggs in their hosts' nests leaving these foster parents to rear their young [2]. In defence, most of these hosts have evolved the ability to recognize cuckoo eggs. It is long-assumed that these interactions select for ever-improving eggshell mimicry in cuckoo host-races laying distinct eggs that specifically mimic their host's eggshell, regardless of its particular colour [3,4]. We challenge this paradigm and demonstrate that coevolutionary arms races and egg colour mimicry are the exception to the rule. Here, using eggshell reflectance spectra from 39 host species and the specific cuckoo eggs found in their nests, we show that eggshell colour mimicry is very uncommon even among frequent hosts. Although cuckoo eggs display considerable variation in eggshell colour, their hosts' eggshell colours occupy 6 times their colour volume. As a result, mimicry is only achieved for a small subset of the egg colour gamut. Furthermore, cuckoo host-races rarely lay eggs that match their hosts' eggs better than those of other potential hosts or that are distinct from those laid by other cuckoo host-races. These patterns are inconsistent with the long-held assumption of coevolutionary arms races, but consistent with coevolutionary alternation that is defined by a process of continual host-switching. These findings open new avenues for research in a system that has long served as a model for studying coevolutionary processes.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

SD is a multigene complex, frequently associated with chromosomal inversions, that kills sperm carrying a large block of satellite DNA called Responder (Rsp). We do not know the mechanism of drive or the role of the target satellite. Here we use transcriptomics in two SD haplotypes that differ in their inversions to link Rsp expression to drive. We found that Rsp-derived small RNAs are underrepresented in driving testes of one SD haplotype. We used genetic experiments to show that over expressing Rsp was sufficient to reduce drive strength in the haplotype with the Rsp smRNA phenotype. We therefore shed light on mechanism of SD by making a connection between the target and driver. Our study also suggests that complex drivers, like SD, can vary in their mechanism of targeting or sperm killing.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Sexual reproduction, through meiotic recombination and segregation, enables the efficient removal of deleterious mutations and facilitates rapid adaptation to shifting environmental pressures.

Oribatid mites (Acari, Sarcoptiformes) represent a unique system for testing these predictions, as they feature multiple, ancient, and independent transitions to asexuality, providing a natural experiment on the evolutionary fate of asexual genomes. We compared four sets of sister sexual and asexual species using high-quality nuclear genome assemblies to investigate the genomic consequences of long-term asexuality. Our study revealed a profound, reproductive-mode-dependent dichotomy in the evolution of genome architecture. Contrary to their expected genomic decay, asexual species have mostly streamlined genomes with less novel genes than their sexual sister species. In contrast, sexual species have acquired genetic innovations, encompassing both gene and transposable element content. These results challenge classical expectations of genomic deterioration in asexual species and might explain the long-term evolutionary persistence of oribatid mites.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we presented chimpanzees from the Mwera South community, a newly habituated community in Bugoma Forest, with variations of the honey-trap experiment and compared their engagement to other Ugandan chimpanzee communities to investigate various aspects of cultural behaviour in animals. First, we wanted to test whether communities varied in cultural attitude towards a given food, and whether this attitude correlated with particular instrumental components of their cultural knowledge. Second, we were interested in analyzing individual variation across individuals within the same culture. Comparing individuals from Bugoma's Mwera South (N=15), Budongo's Sonso (N=34), and Kibale's Kanyawara (N=14) communities, we found that the latter both exhibited higher engagement with the honey-trap, and a dedicated instrumental method, stick use, to obtain the honey. In contrast, Sonso and Mwera South chimpanzees appeared similar in lacking a cultural attitude towards honey, with no attached tool technique overall. Nevertheless, there were also strong inter-individual differences. Notably, some Mwera South chimpanzees displayed undescribed behavioural flexibility, using a range of tool behaviours including both stick and leaf tool use, a pattern never before documented in over a decade of honey-trap experiments.

To address these challenges, we developed bronko, an ultrafast alignment-free framework for detecting viral variation directly from sequencing data. The novel computational approach implemented in bronko allows scaling to massive viral sequencing datasets and has three key components: i) a locality-sensitive bucketing function to rapidly identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relative to reference(s), ii) a direct k-mer count psuedo-mapping approach that approximates a pileup without alignment, and iii) a streaming-based sliding window outlier test to estimate baseline noise across the genome and precisely differentiate real minor variants from noise. Together, these components yield near-linear computational complexity with respect to sequencing depth, enabling bronko to process thousands of viral samples rapidly on modest hardware. Our results are threefold: 1) On simulated amplicon sequencing, bronko recovers variants with higher precision and comparable recall to existing tools while running up to one to three orders of magnitude faster; 2) bronko generates sequence alignments directly from sequencing data, with SNP content similar to that of whole-genome alignment while also running in a fraction of the time, and 3) applying bronko to longitudinal sequencing data from chronically infected SARS-CoV-2 patients revealed consistent patterns of intrahost diversification and adaptive mutations over time.

T1 mapping was performed at high resolution (0.9-mm isotropic) to capture anatomical details of the CSF spaces and was also repeated more rapidly at a lower resolution (3-mm isotropic) to capture the temporal dynamics of T1 changes. Region-dependent reductions in T1 were observed, indicating increased oxygen concentration. These occurred most prominently and rapidly in the cortical subarachnoid space, stabilising within approximately 7 minutes of initiating hyperoxia, suggesting that oxygen diffusion primarily occurs via pial arteries. Slower changes, commencing after approximately 10 minutes, occurred in the posterior lateral ventricles, where choroid plexus is found.

Knockout plants exhibited improved performance under progressive drought stress and during rewatering drought, maintaining higher stomatal conductance, elevated transpiration rates, and superior photosynthetic efficiency compared to wild-type (WT) plants. These improved performance under similar transpiration rate led to higher agronomic water-use efficiency (AWUE) in stvinv plants resulting in greater biomass production despite reduced water availability. Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct adaptive strategies; stvinv plants preferentially accumulated galactinol and raffinose, indicating enhanced raffinose family oligosaccharide (RFO) metabolism.

In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), floral survival and fertility are major determinants of grain yield, yet the physiological processes supporting early inflorescence development remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated PEIG, a light-dependent chlorophyll accumulation occurring while immature inflorescences are still enclosed by leaf sheaths, and its role in overall inflorescence development. Using chlorophyll autofluorescence imaging and chlorophyll quantification, we found that PEIG in barley initiates at a surprisingly early developmental stage, when developing spikes are still enclosed by leaf sheaths. PEIG first appears in the central rachis and then progressively spreads to the spikelet primordia and other floral organs. Using a non-destructive dark treatment method designed for preventing light exposure to developing inflorescences, we further demonstrated that the inhibition of PEIG does not affect floral initiation but significantly reduces floral survival and pollen viability, particularly in the tip region of the inflorescence, indicating a critical role of light mediated PEIG in floral fate. Finally, analysis of natural variation for PEIG revealed a strong positive correlation between PEIG and floral survival. Our findings establish PEIG as an underappreciated hidden trait that supports floral viability and reproductive success, with implications to enhance grain yield potential in cereals.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Neuronal intrinsic excitability provides the baseline that homeostatic mechanisms act to preserve, yet the processes that establish a baseline remain poorly defined. Developmental critical periods (CPs) are thought to play a central role, but the link between early activity and long-term intrinsic properties is not well characterised. To address this, we used the genetic tractability of the Drosophila larval locomotor circuit to manipulate individual neurons during an embryonic CP. Following optogenetic excitation or inhibition, during the CP, we assessed intrinsic excitability of the same neurons in third-instar larvae (i.e. ~5 days thereafter). We compared an excitatory premotor interneuron (A27h), an inhibitory premotor interneuron (A31k), and a motor neuron (aCC). Both interneurons exhibited anti-homeostatic responses: excitatory perturbation increased intrinsic excitability, while inhibitory perturbation decreased it, effects that persisted throughout larval development. In contrast, motor neurons showed no significant changes under the same conditions, revealing cell type-specific sensitivity to early activity. These findings build on the general principles of the functional relationships between CP activity and neuronal excitability and how intrinsic excitability is not passively set but actively shaped during these windows, with long-lasting, neuron-specific consequences. More broadly, our results highlight how developmental perturbations can alter the excitatory:inhibitory balance of mature neural circuits that may contribute to the aetiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we reveal the role of Rlig1 during vertebrate development using embryonic and larval zebrafish as a model system. We found that rlig1 mRNA is maternally deposited and present ubiquitously during early embryogenesis, whereas at larval stages it localises to the brain and eyes. Interestingly, CRISPR/Cas9-generated rlig1 knockout zebrafish exhibited no overt morphological abnormalities, but showed reduced behavioural responsiveness to visual stimuli along with massively perturbed transcriptomes and widespread dysregulation of core metabolic and translational pathways. Brain-wide calcium imaging in rlig1 knockout larvae revealed decreased neuronal activity in key regions for visual processing, consistent with the observed behavioural defects.

Here, we demonstrate that the formation and elongation of h3D-gastruloids is modulated by the activity levels of the Hippo pathway effector YAP. Using complementary chemical and genetic perturbations, we show that elevated nuclear YAP activity inhibits gastruloid elongation, whereas YAP inhibition enhances axial elongation relative to controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses reveal that YAP activation disrupts the establishment of distinct anterior GATA6 and posterior CDX2 poles. Conversely, YAP inhibition promotes clearer segregation of these domains, facilitating symmetry breaking and elongation. Finally, we developed a high-throughput platform for h3D-gastruloid generation, enabling the production of over 500 gastruloids per well.

This challenge is exemplified in western Alaska Chinook salmon, where recent population declines have led to closures of in-river subsistence fisheries, but identifying the cause of these declines is limited by an inability to identify the river of origin for marine-caught fish in offshore fisheries that target more abundant species and populations. This problem is particularly acute for estimating the impacts of bycatch on individual salmon populations which have demographic independence but no genetic differentiation from which stock assignments can be made. Here we use machine learning approaches to assess the efficacy of using the microchemical history preserved in fish otoliths to assign individuals to their river of origin in western Alaska. We tested the classification ability of three machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines) combined with two time series smoothing techniques (Moving Average and Generalized Additive Models) to classify Chinook salmon to their river of origin using otolith time series data. Model accuracy ranged from 71.9% to 92.5%, with optimal performance achieved by Random Forest applied to GAM-smoothed data. Watershed-specific performance ranged from 86.8% to 93.7%, with most misclassifications occurring between spatially proximate Kuskokwim and Nushagak rivers. Raw predicted probabilities from classification algorithms were calibrated to reflect true class probabilities, enabling the incorporation of model results into decision analyses with explicit consideration of misclassification risk tolerance. The success of these models offers immediate utility for estimating marine mortality impacts across the region's three major river systems as well as an opportunity to understand commercial fisheries impacts on individual populations at substantially finer spatial scales than had been previously possible.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

However, the robustness of divergence time estimates across multiple co-distributed species or population pairs in the face of post-divergence gene flow is often left unaddressed. Here, we use a simulation-based approach to test the robustness of estimating simultaneous divergence within a full-likelihood Bayesian framework when the model assumptions of no gene flow are violated. We generated simulated datasets of multiple population pairs with varying migration rates and estimate shared divergence times with the software package Ecoevolity, comparing them with estimates from population pairs experiencing no migration. Our goal was to identify the threshold at which migration rates begin to bias divergence time estimates, providing insight into the robustness of full-likelihood Bayesian methods under more complex demographic scenarios. We found that simultaneous divergence is incorrectly supported across a broad range of parameters space when assumptions are violated. We suggest that future empirical studies that use simultaneous divergence testing explicitly test for gene flow, or at the very least, explicitly consider the presence, absence, and implications of gene flow in their systems as part of their investigations. We assert that this result, biased support for simultaneous divergence, is just a specific example of a general behavior when the statistical assumptions of the model are not met or there is insufficient power given the data. We additionally recommend that future studies reorient their research framework to focus on trying to demonstrate non-simultaneous divergence in systems. As such, support for simultaneous divergence between groups should be interpreted as failure to resolve non-simultaneous divergence rather than evidence of true simultaneous divergence.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Single-cell RNA sequencing of zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, combined with expression data in regenerating salamander limbs and mouse digit tips, implicated the SP family of transcription factors as conserved, epidermally-expressed mediators of appendage regrowth. Null mutants of Sp8 demonstrated impaired limb regeneration in salamanders, while conditional knockout of Sp6 and/or Sp8 in the mouse basal epidermis resulted in defective bony digit tip regeneration, involving an IL-17 mediated osteoclastogenic program. Spatiotemporally focused expression of FGF8, a known target of SP factors, using a zebrafish-derived tissue regeneration enhancer element via adeno-associated viral vectors, could partially rescue digit tip regeneration in SP knockout mice and accelerate digit regeneration in wildtype mice.

In the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Laurentian Channel (GSL-LC), massive Sebastes recruitments occurred in early 2010s, nearly 30 years after the last strong cohort. This recruitment had resulted in abundant Sebastes mentella, but also involved the morphologically nearly indistinguishable S. fasciatus. Both species show multiple populations, but spatially explicit information at a management-relevant scale is lacking to support robust scientific advices for sustainable fisheries. Temporal variation in the Sebastes recruitment also remains poorly characterized, and it is unknown if the recruitment is synchronized at the species or population level. This study aimed to 1) characterize the current fine-scale genomic structure of S. mentella and S. fasciatus in the GSL-LC, 2) compare the genetic composition of different cohorts, and 3) evaluate relationship between genomic structure and two key factors in redfish management, depth, and management units. Our genomic datasets (> 16,000 SNPs, N = 2,248 redfish) revealed substructure within the previously identified S. mentella GSL ecotype and five S. fasciatus populations within the GSL-LC. While all genetic groups were represented in the recent cohort samples, our results suggested unequal contributions of S. fasciatus populations to massive recruitment events. The spatial distribution of genetic groups within both species revealed a three-dimensional structure tied to management units and depth.

The instability of RNA, coupled with the abundance of RNases and difficult-to-lyse microbial cells, often results in degraded or low-yield RNA, hampering downstream applications. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we developed a simple, rapid, cost-effective, and efficient microbial RNA extraction method, which is equally effective for pure cultures and complex microbiomes. The method utilises low pH (4.7) and high temperature to lyse the cells, followed by rapid cooling to induce misfolded renaturation of genomic DNA and proteins. During the phase separation step, RNA remains in the aqueous phase and is subsequently precipitated using chilled isopropanol. The RNA suspended in double-distilled water (pH 6.5) remained stable for six months at -20 degree C. Further, we compared amplicon microbiome profiles generated from metagenomic DNA and cDNA (synthesised from extracted meta-RNA) derived from the broiler gut, taken as a model system. Our findings reveal that the cDNA-based amplicon microbiome composition more accurately deciphers the metabolically active population in gut environments that aligns with culture-based enumeration of viable microbes.

It is caused by several lyssaviruses and leads to an encephalitis, which is 100% fatal after symptom onset. The most common cause of rabies is the rabies virus (RABV), which leads to around 59,000 human deaths globally every year. The infection leads to drastic changes in host behaviour, but the underlying mechanistic details remain unclear. Although interactions between the viral glycoprotein and host nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been proposed as drivers of rabies-associated neurological dysfunction, clinical proteomic studies in naturally infected canines have been partially explored. In this study, we conducted a global proteomics analysis of RABV-infected and non-infected canine brain samples in India to unravel the changes in protein expression. Using liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry, we identified various host proteins and pathways dysregulated in the infected state. Approximately 700 proteins exhibited differential expression, with around 250 proteins involved in various pathways being significantly upregulated and approximately 500 proteins being significantly downregulated in the infected condition. Network clustering of the dysregulated proteins revealed functional modules, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis, actin cytoskeletal regulation, and the TCA cycle, indicating widespread alterations in cellular trafficking, energy metabolism, and structural integrity. Complementary pathway enrichment through PANTHER identified processes linked to axon guidance, integrin signalling, chemokine and cytokine-mediated inflammation, and cytoskeletal regulation, underscoring the profound impact of rabies virus infection on neuronal connectivity and host immune responses", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

In this study, we have performed a global proteomic analysis to identify host proteins ubiquitylated in response to expression of these three effectors in human cells. Using enrichment strategies combined with mass spectrometry under conditions where the proteasome is active or not, we identified 214 putative substrates of ubiquitylation. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, cytoskeleton organization, chromatin remodeling, and vesicular trafficking. In vitro ubiquitylation assays validated five novel substrates and revealed differential substrate specificity and patterns of ubiquitin chain topology among the effectors. Notably, expression of SspH1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae disrupted polysome profiles in a ligase activity dependent manner, indicating a direct impact of the bacterial effector on translation of eukaryotic cells. Comparison with previously published global interactomes and ubiquitylomes supports a model in which Salmonella NEL effectors subvert a broader range of host pathways through targeted ubiquitylation.

MMS-2, enriched in iron oxides, exhibited higher oxidative potential than MGS-1, which is mainly composed of basaltic material. Viral survival was assessed across variables including time, temperature, concentration, and particle size.

Using RNA-seq, we characterized gene expression profiles across single and combined stress conditions. Both G and BBR elicited distinct stress responses, including modulation of oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and immune pathways. OrV infection alone induced robust transcriptional changes, but its impact was significantly attenuated when combined with either abiotic stress, suggesting antagonistic interactions. Notably, proviral genes such as drl-1, fat-7 and hipr-1 were downregulated under BBR and G, potentially impairing viral replication. Gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment in immune effectors, RNA metabolism, and proteostasis-related pathways, particularly under BBR. Viral load and RNA2/RNA1 ratios were reduced in both stress conditions, indicating a shift in viral replication dynamics. Moreover, genomic diversity and defective viral genome formation were differentially affected, with increased genetic diversity and structural variation under stress.

Here, we report the characterization of MttQ (98 aa) and MttS (49 aa), products of small ORFs situated in an operon alongside genes encoding a drug-metabolite-efflux (DME) family transporter (mttP) and other enzymes involved in trimethylamine (TMA) degradation. MttS and MttQ interact with MttP to form a stable oligomeric complex spanning the cytoplasmic membrane. TMA transport activity of the MttQ/MttS/MttP-complex is demonstrated via in vivo Escherichia coli cells heterologously expressing this system. Based on the reduced growth of a M. mazei mutant lacking mttS, on TMA as sole carbon source, we conclude that MttS governs the specificity of TMA transport. We posit that interactions between a DME transporter, e.g., MttP, and small proteins fueled evolution of the MttPQS complex and the advent of selective TMA uptake in methylotrophic methanoarchaea. These findings suggest an evolutionary mechanism on how small accessory proteins can alter conserved core functions in order to explore new ecological niches.

We profiled eighteen closely related Stutzerimonas strains, including the model S. perfectomarina ZoBell, and identified three phenotypic clusters (full, partial and low nitrite accumulators; FNA, PNA and LNA) based on the fraction of NO3--N transiently accumulated as NO2-. FNA and PNA strains carry both periplasmic (NapA) and membrane-bound (NarG) NO3- reductases. FNA strains carry the nitrite reductase NirS clade 1b and NirTB, potentially regulating nirS, while PNA strains carry NirS clade 1a and lack NirTB. FNA showed delayed transcription of nirS when NO3- was present, likely explaining its NO2- accumulation phenotype. LNA strains lack narG or express it late, balancing NO2- production.

Overall, our findings suggest a much broader role for glycosylation as a regulator of cellular functions and opens up investigation into the role of glycans in many more biological processes.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that the presence of tsRNAs in Escherichia coli depends on active translation, and that they are found in the 30S ribosomal subunit and the ribosomal-free fraction, but not in the 50S subunits, 70S ribosomes or polysome fractions. However, upon dissociation into subunits at a low magnesium concentration, some of the tRNAs present in the monosomal and polysomal fractions are processed into tsRNAs. RNA-seq analyses tsRNA fractions revealed that all tRNA species in the cell were processed into fragment profiles that varied widely for each tRNA. The E. coli CP78 strain contains an unusually high concentration of tsRNAAsnGUU, but it is likely that only a fraction of this participates in translation. These tRNAs, along with others in the cell, were released from the ribosomes and processed into tsRNAs. The tRNAs in the ribosomal-free fraction appear to be cleaved by the same RNase that is active in ribosomes. We propose that tsRNAs are generated as an initial decay step for tRNAs remaining on ribosomes following translation arrest. However, tsRNAs may also have other functions.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

From reduced expression in cancer cell lines, it had been proposed to be a tumor suppressor in humans. In contrast, it is required for normal larval development of Caenorhabditis elegans, thereby raising an apparent contradiction for HID1 function regarding the inhibition or maintenance of cell proliferation. An extensive comparison of publicly available gene expression data revealed that HID1 transcript levels in cancer cell lines were not representative of those in primary tumors, and the gene is amplified in many primary tumors. These findings question the role for its expression to suppress cell proliferation. Subsequently, we employed the model S. pombe to explore the role of HID1 in cell proliferation. The knock-out mutant hid1{Delta} exhibited a reduced proliferation phenotype due to a prolonged lag-phase but, eventually, attained parent strain rates of apparent proliferation. RNAseq-based transcriptomics revealed that hid1{Delta} retained features of metabolically stressed cells with quiescence-like transcriptional regulation. A label-free proteomic analysis revealed a lack of various membrane proteins suggesting cells with compromised Golgi apparatus (GA) function. The inability of hid1{Delta} to grow on agar containing a standard minimal medium suggested a link to metabolic deficiency. These findings point to a hid1{Delta}-related perturbation in GA function that compromises cell recovery from metabolic change.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Yet, centromeric DNA is highly variable and rapidly evolving. In fungi, centromeres range from point centromeres to regional centromeres, some of which are hundreds of thousands of base pairs long and filled with transposable elements. As fungi have evolved several specialized defense mechanisms against transposable elements, these regional centromeres are intriguing sites for investigating the connection between genome defense and centromere evolution. Here, we used experimental and genomic analyses to investigate the size and DNA content of the centromeres of seven species of the Podospora anserina species complex, which is made up of eight closely related filamentous ascomycetes. We discovered that the genome of one species in the complex, P. pseudocomata, lacks the genomic signature of the specialized genome defense mechanism called Repeat Induced Point mutations (RIP). We identified the centromeric regions in P. anserina and P. pseudocomata using chromatin immunoprecipitation targeting the centromere-specific histone variant cenH3, and using comparative genomics we inferred the size of centromeric regions in the other species in the complex. We found that the centromeric regions of P. pseudocomata are 35-46 kb, which is significantly smaller than those of the other species (44-90 kb). Furthermore, they have a different transposable element content than the other species, suggesting that a rapid turnover of the DNA content has taken place in this lineage. Taken together, our data strongly indicates a link between genome defense and centromere evolution in fungi.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

This work presents scpImaging, a novel computational pipeline that repurposes the latent microscopy data routinely generated during cellenONE-based sample preparation to provide deterministic quality control (QC) and high-content phenotypic profiling. We demonstrate that standard proteomic quality metrics for SCP (e.g., peptide count, signal intensity) paradoxically favour retaining doublets. In contrast, scpImaging applies machine-learning-based cell segmentation (Cellpose-SAM) to identify and exclude these artefacts with high precision. Furthermore, the framework integrates morphological metrics generated using the open-source CellProfiler, with proteomic abundance data, enabling joint analysis that links cell shape and texture to molecular cell state.

Here, we explored the microbial and glycobiological connectivity between the sea surface microlayer (SML), the underlying seawater (ULW), snow, and aerosol particles in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, 79N) during autumn and spring. The marked overlap between marine and atmospheric microbiomes illustrates considerable sea-air transfer, linked to seasonally distinct environmental communities. For instance, Polaribacter and Formosa were aerosolized during the spring bloom, compared to Colwellia in autumn. Air-mass trajectories and microbial source tracking revealed a greater marine contribution in autumn, whereas spring aerosols were shaped by stronger winds and the cryosphere. Aerosol particles nonetheless contained numerous unique taxa, including Actinobacteria likely originating from terrestrial sources. Linking bacterial, microeukaryotic, carbohydrate, and meteorological dynamics established an overarching perspective across seasons and habitats, identifying four distinct ecosystem states. Genome-sequenced bacterial model isolates, representing key environmental populations, encode adaptive traits such as carotenoid and ectoine biosynthesis, supporting survival in the SML and atmospheric transfer.

A key obstacle in understanding gene fitness in Bacteroidota is the lack of genome-wide functional studies, largely due to their inherent resistance to antibiotics, which complicates genetic manipulation. In this study, we used randomly barcoded transposon mutagenesis sequencing (RB-TnSeq) to measure gene fitness in a plant-associated Bacteroidota, Mucilaginibacter yixingensis YX-36. Our data sheds light on pathways involved in rhizosphere colonization, gliding motility, stress tolerance, and carbon metabolism.

Whereas the mechanisms underlying CTXphi-associated horizontal gene transfer and transcriptional control of the ctxAB genes have been intensively studied over the past years, post-transcriptional regulation affecting the CTXphi life-cycle has not been documented. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of the CisR small RNA (sRNA) that is produced from the 3UTR (untranslated region) of the prtV gene and inhibits the expression of the CTXphi-encoded cep mRNA. CisR-mediated repression of cep involves Hfq-assisted base-pairing of the two transcripts and results in reduced CTXphi production under stress conditions. We further demonstrate that transcription of prtV-cisR requires both the master quorum-sensing regulator HapR and CRP, a global regulator of carbon metabolism.

Subsequently, antiviral RNAi activity was detected in both H. schachtii and G. rostochiensis using small RNA sequencing. For G. rostochiensis two distinct genotypes were investigated.

We identified the macrocyclic peptide WJL-63, developed using mRNA display, with high ACE2-binding affinity. The peptide was characterized in vitro in terms of purity, stability, hydrophilicity and ACE2 binding. The crystal structure of the extracellular region of ACE2 in complex with the peptide at 2.2 [A] resolution was elucidated. The structure revealed a binding mode in which WJL-63 is accommodated towards one side of the wide catalytic cleft of the ACE2 peptidase domain, with no direct contact to the conserved zinc ion site. WJL-63 residues Q4, R7, R11 and R14 anchor the peptide deep inside the binding pocket. The opposite edges of the peptide were found to be in contact with subdomain 1 and subdomain 2 of the peptidase domain. This upright binding mode requires an open ACE2 conformation, in contrast to small molecule carboxypeptidase inhibitors, which typically bind to the closed conformation of the enzyme. As a consequence of the open conformation binding mode, the front edge of WJL-63 is accessible for modification such as the herein reported conjugation of a chelator for radiometal labeling.

However, both proteins are also transcription termination factors, and it is unclear which of the processes they promote might contribute to carcinogenesis. Here, we employ a cellular model of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and find that cells from primary tumor are addicted to high levels of CPSF73 and PCF11, while metastatic cells become less sensitive to their levels. We find no association between alternative polyadenylation (APA) and cell dependence on CPSF73 and PCF11, and no impact of their downregulation on transcription-replication collisions. Instead, we uncover an uncoupling of changes in 3' cleavage and termination during CRC progression: primary tumor-derived cells display a global shift to more proximal termination, yet a tendency for distal APA, compared to normal cells. Metastatic cells display partial reversion toward termination patterns observed in normal cells, and opposite tendency favoring proximal APA. This prompts us to measure the distance between the site of 3' cleavage and transcription termination for active protein-coding genes and find it almost halved in cells from primary tumor compared to normal cells. Interestingly, this distance becomes critically short for oncogenes. Closer proximity of 3' cleavage to termination correlates with higher gene expression, both across genes within a cell line and when distance and expression change in parallel.

Community structure of both bacteria and fungi was largely driven by field site including its main chemical characteristics, with rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from the same site displaying comparable assemblages. Higher soil microbial diversity was associated with higher postharvest storability in the stored carrots. The weather during the growing season also had an effect on the observed fungal biodiversity, which was higher at sites that had lower temperatures and less rain prior to harvest.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

Within the mosquito midgut, malaria parasite gametes are activated and undergo fertilisation. If parasite fertilisation is perturbed, this stops the transmission of malaria parasites from mosquito to human. One proposed target of transmission-blocking interventions is Plasmodium falciparum fusogen PfHAP2, which is essential for gamete fusion during parasite fertilisation. However, to date, no monoclonal antibodies or structures of PfHAP2 have been generated. We have identified nanobodies that bind specifically to domain 3 of PfHAP2 with nanomolar affinities, two of which show some cross-species reactivity with HAP2 of other Plasmodium species. The crystal structure of one nanobody in complex with domain 3 of PfHAP2 provides the first structural insights into this transmission-blocking target in P. falciparum.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

A.; Whitaker, R.; Heath, K.", "abstract": "Ecological and evolutionary processes jointly shape community responses to environmental perturbations, yet are often examined separately, even in microorganisms, where they occur on similar timescales and are linked by mobile genetic elements like plasmids. Mutualism breakdown is a pressing challenge to examine this intersection, as shifts in diverse microbial communities might coincide with evolutionary changes in mutualistic traits within a key species. Here we study the legume-rhizobium mutualism after 33 years of nitrogen fertilization. Pairing manipulative inoculation studies with long-read amplicon sequencing provides unprecedented resolution across biological scales: whole bacterial community, genus Rhizobium, individual Rhizobium ASVs, and symbiosis plasmids. Clover host plants in N-fertilized plots encounter microbial communities depauperate in their preferred symbiont but enriched in other Rhizobium taxa; moreover, their symbiotic nodules house low-quality symbiosis plasmids. Thus, concurrent ecological and evolutionary shifts make mutualists both rarer and inferior and feed back to decrease the benefits hosts receive from mutualism.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Simulation-based inference methods are increasingly being used in population genetics due to their flexibility and ability to be applied in settings where likelihood-based methods are intractable. Perhaps the best known such method is Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC); however, its popularity is offset by its shortcomings which include computational expense and an unfortunate inability to fit models to high-dimensional summaries of the data. An alternative approach that solves these issues is supervised machine learning (ML); however, ML methods generally do not yield Bayesian uncertainty estimates of the quantities they predict. Here, we apply a recently introduced method, neural posterior estimation (NPE), that combines the best facets of ABC and supervised ML by training a neural network to estimate the posterior distribution of a population genetics model. We first compare neural posterior estimation with other inference methods for a variety of population genetic tasks, and show that neural posterior estimators yield posterior distributions with high accuracy and efficiency. We compare learned posterior distributions given raw genotypes and various summary statistics as input data. Additionally, we apply neural posterior estimation for demographic inference for simple and more complex models to highlight its application. Finally, we provide a user friendly workflow that enables others to perform neural posterior estimation to their own genetic data.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

While cargo is typically loaded into VLPs by disassembling the protein shell and reassembling it around a cargo of interest, protocols for disassembly and reassembly remain inconsistent and poorly standardized. Here we systematically assess a wide array of reported techniques and evaluate the key steps of this process experimentally. First, we optimize acid-based disassembly and acid removal methods and identify trade-offs between speed, recovery, and accessibility. Next, we examine what experimental conditions impact the VLP reassembly yield. We establish a standardized reassembly yield quantification framework using size exclusion chromatography calibrated against purified VLP standards. We then employ this framework in a full-factorial design of experiments that reveal that an increase in sodium chloride concentration strongly inhibits reassembly efficiency, while pH and crowding agents exert only minor effects. The linear model fits the experimental data indicates that optimal reassembly conditions extend beyond those tested to date. Our findings provide practical guidelines and a reproducible framework for MS2 VLP disassembly and reassembly, enabling more reliable encapsulation strategies across applications.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}

R.; Blazewicz, S. J.; Holland-Moritz, H.; Hicks Pries, C.; Allen, G. M.; Pett-Ridge, J.; Lopez, F. M.; Grandy, A. S.; Wieder, W.; Ernakovich, J.", "abstract": "Warming temperatures are accelerating permafrost thaw and changing tundra vegetation, where woody shrubs are displacing sedges. Shrubs, such as Betula nana, and sedges, such as Eriophorum vaginatum, exhibit distinct life strategies including unique root-associated, or rhizosphere microbial communities. As permafrost thaws it unlocks previously unavailable carbon and nutrient sources resulting in deeper roots and a translocation of rhizosphere communities. Because permafrost microbial communities contain lower diversity and biomass than rhizosphere communities, the coalescence of rhizosphere and permafrost microbial communities could alter soil organic matter (SOM) degradation rates and increase greenhouse gas emissions. To identify metabolic strategies across distinct rhizosphere and permafrost microbial communities we conducted an isotope tracing incubation experiment. We inoculated thawed permafrost with shrub and sedge rhizosphere communities while adding exudates or water daily and compared this to an uninoculated control. After 46 days, we spiked samples with 18O enriched water or 13C enriched exudates and measured isotope incorporation into microbial DNA with quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP). Our results indicate that exudate additions had little effect on uninoculated permafrost communities but the addition of exudates and rhizosphere inoculants had a compounding effect on respiration rates. We found that soils inoculated with shrub rhizosphere communities contained a mixture of exudate and SOM degraders while soils inoculated with sedge rhizosphere communities contained mainly SOM degraders. Finally, we found that individual microbial taxa exhibited maximum growth rates in one environment, which was a combination of microbial inoculant communities and exudate addition treatments. Our results reveal that microbial niches are strongly influenced by substrate preferences and community context, and suggest that a reduction in sedges and an expansion of shrubs may provide a mechanism by which permafrost carbon losses are mitigated through corresponding shifts in microbial communities and their substrate preferences.", "date": "2025-12-02", "journal": ""}
