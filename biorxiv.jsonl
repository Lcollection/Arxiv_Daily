L.; Kann, M. R.; Ackerman, S. D.", "abstract": "Neurons have an outsized metabolic demand, requiring continuous metabolic support from non-neuronal cells called glia. When this support fails, toxic metabolic byproducts accumulate, ultimately leading to excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Astrocytes, the primary synapse-associated glial cell type, are known to provide essential metabolites (e.g. lactate) to sustain neuronal function. Here, we leverage the well-characterized Drosophila motor circuit to investigate another means of astrocyte-to-neuron metabolic support: activity-dependent trafficking of astrocyte mitochondria. Following optogenetic activation, motor neuron mitochondria migrate away from synapses. By contrast, astrocytic mitochondria accumulated peri-synaptically, and at times, were transferred into neighboring neurons. A genetic screen identified the mitochondrial adaptor protein Milton as a key regulator of this process. Astrocyte-specific milton knockdown disrupted regular mitochondrial trafficking, resulting in locomotor deficits, dysfunctional motor activity, and altered synapse number at the neuromuscular junction. These findings suggest that astrocytes dynamically redistribute mitochondria to buffer metabolic demand at synapses, highlighting a potential mechanism by which glia protect neural circuits from metabolic failure and neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Interactions between and within these subsystems enable multiscale information processing. Despite this multiscale characteristic, functional brain connectivity is often either estimated based on 10-30 distributed modes or parcellations with 100-1000 localised parcels, both missing across-scale functional interactions. We present Multiscale Probabilistic Functional Modes (mPFMs), a new mapping which comprises modes over various scales of granularity, thus enabling direct estimation of functional connectivity within- and across-scales. Crucially, mPFMs were not formulated, but emerged from data-driven multilevel Bayesian modelling of large functional MRI (fMRI) populations and every individual. We demonstrate that mPFMs capture both distributed brain modes and their co-existing subcomponents. In addition to validating mPFMs using simulations and real data, we show that mPFMs can predict ~900 personalised traits from UK Biobank more accurately than current standard techniques. Therefore, mPFMs can offer a new basis for functional connectivity modelling and yield enhanced fMRI biomarkers for traits and diseases.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "The advent of affordable high-throughput genome sequencing has drastically expanded protein sequence databases, necessitating the development of computational tools to predict protein function from sequence data. Current methods, such as BLASTp and profile HMMs, while effective, are limited by difficulties in detecting remote homologs and uncertainties in multiple sequence alignments. To address this, we explore the use of clustering algorithms for unsupervised protein function annotation, using pseudo-amino acid composition (PAAC) as features. In this study, we evaluated nine clustering algorithms for their ability to segregate protein sequences based on functional differences using the PAAC feature. Using intrinsic metrics, particularly the silhouette coefficient (SC), we determined the optimal number of clusters (k) for each algorithm. We observed that agglomerative clustering produced results resembling phylogenetic relationships; even k-means clustering, Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and spectral clustering do so but occasionally merge datapoints from distinct original clusters at higher k values. Our findings reveal that k-means clustering, GMM, and agglomerative clustering effectively segregate distinct protein functional families, but effectiveness decreases when distinguishing fine-grained functional differences. Notably, spectral clustering underperformed relative to other methods. Affinity propagation clustering, while effective in some cases, generated more clusters than expected and is prone to false positives. Overall, we find that some of the clustering algorithms are suitable for functional annotation of protein sequences using PAAC as a feature set, even when the number of ground-truth sequences is limited. The implementation of the clustering method for protein sequences is available in the GitHub repository linked below. It provides comprehensive steps for preprocessing, feature extraction, clustering, and evaluation.

A.", "abstract": "CONTEXT: Tropical cropping systems must adapt to the current and future geographic distribution of pathogen and pest communities. An important research gap is how climate change may shift the distribution of pathogens and pests in tropical lowlands and highlands. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the current geographic risk of 27 pathogens and pests in the production of four food security crops (banana, cassava, potato, and sweetpotato) in the Great Lakes region of Africa, and the potential future risk under climate change. Models for each pathogen and pest indicate the potential for changes in geographic distribution, with model fit indicating the potential for decision support systems to facilitate management. METHODS: First, cropland connectivity analysis identified locations likely important in the spread of crop-specific pathogens and pests, such as locations in Rwanda and Burundi. Second, we surveyed the 27 economically important pathogens and pests in Rwanda and Burundi, mapping the distribution of each across climate gradients and quantifying patterns of association. Third, we used machine learning to develop models of each species as a function of environmental variables, including host landscape variables. We also evaluated the increase in temperature across altitudes under future climate change scenarios in this region. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Among the ten machine-learning algorithms evaluated, random forests and support vector machines generally performed best for predicting severity and infestation. Host landscape variables were useful predictors for some species. Based on climate matching, 44% of the pathogens and pests could become more common with warmer temperatures at higher altitudes, while 17% may become less common. SIGNIFICANCE: This study indicates adaptation priorities for crop health in a region with multiple challenges to agricultural sustainability. The models developed here also indicate which species may have more potential and relevance for future development of pathogen and pest forecasts.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Harpins are known to trigger hypersensitive response followed by induction of systemic acquired resistance in non-host plants. However, the molecular mechanism of harpin-induced hypersensitive response remained largely unexplored, mainly because of lack of structural information. In this study, we report the cloning of a new harpin gene (hrpZ2) from Pseudomonas syringae strain MTCC-11950, belonging to the harpin superfamily. In silico analysis revealed that about 50.29% of the protein consists of alpha-helices, 48.53% are random coils, and only 1.16% are beta-sheets, and nearly half (42%) of the protein consists of intrinsically disordered regions. Based on a prokaryotic predictive model and the presence of a signal peptide on its N-terminus, the subcellular localization of harpin is predicted as extracellular. To date, no experimentally determined crystal structure of any harpin protein is available. Therefore, we built and validated a three-dimentional model (with 99% of residues in allowed/additionally allowed regions and a Z-score of -5.3) of harpin. Phylogenetic analysis and functional domain studies revealed that this new harpin belongs to the harpin superfamily. Infiltration of harpin in tobacco leaves resulted in hypersensitive response, which was associated with oxidative burst, callose deposition, localized cell death, and increased activity of defense-related enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase. Furthermore, infiltration of harpin in non-host plants from different angiosperm families induced hypersensitive response, indicating broad-spectrum agricultural applicability of this new harpin protein. This study elucidates the molecular and functional properties of the new harpin protein and its ability to induce hypersensitive response across a broad range of non-host plants.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

However, association analyses in large biobanks and molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) studies now routinely identify millions of association signals across thousands of traits, making it infeasible to test for colocalisation between all pairs of signals. Here we introduce gpu-coloc, a GPU-accelerated re-implementation of the coloc algorithm that combines efficient data storage with parallelisation to achieve a 1000-fold speed increase while maintaining near-identical results. As a result, the run time of gpu-coloc now approaches the colocalisation posterior probability (CLPP) method, a competing method that only uses information from fine mapped credible sets to detect colocalisations. Using summary statistics from UK Biobank, FinnGen, and eQTL Catalogue, we demonstrate that gpu-coloc and CLPP detect highly concordant results, especially when restricting the analysis to confidently fine mapped signals. We introduce the colocalisation collider metric to quantify spurious colocalisations in large-scale colocalisation graphs and use it to choose decision thresholds that provide a reasonable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we demonstrate how gpu-coloc can also be applied to marginal GWAS summary statistics from studies that lack fine mapping, where it is still able to recover molQTL colocalisations for ~80% of the GWAS loci.

A common assumption in life-history theory is that intra-species lifespan variation can be explained by trade-offs between reproduction and survival, i.e., individuals investing more in early-life reproduction are expected to live shorter. However, the trade-off assumption can mask alternative models. For example, individual quality could affect reproduction and survival in the same direction; e.g., high-quality individuals may both reproduce more and live longer. Here, we study the naturally short-lived turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), an annual teleost with a limited reproductive window, which, according to the trade-off model, should generate a selective pressure that maximizes individual investment in early-life reproduction, at the expense of survival. To test the individual co-variation in reproduction and lifespan, we focused on males and performed IVFs using ejaculates collected longitudinally throughout life. Unlike the trade-off expectation, we found that reproduction outcomes of young individuals positively correlate with male lifespan, suggesting that early-life reproduction is a bona fide proxy for intrinsic individual quality. Using a causal-informed simulation, we showed that a parsimonious model where i) intrinsic quality affects both lifespan and reproduction and ii) age negatively impacts reproduction, largely recapitulates the observed data, including lifespan prediction from early-life reproduction. Our findings challenge the assumption that reproductive costs are the primary drivers of lifespan variation and instead highlight intrinsic quality as a key common cause to both lifespan and reproduction.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

By partitioning reference databases and introducing taxonomic novelty, we derive thresholds that distinguish known from unknown reads at multiple taxonomic levels. These thresholds remain consistent across database sizes, indicating that once a lineage is represented, novelty detection performance stabilizes.

While its role in reducing drug susceptibility is well established, the broader consequences of resistance mutations on bacterial physiology and behavior during infection remain poorly understood. Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered among the highest-priority bacterial threats, with resistance commonly driven by loss-of-function mutations in the carbapenem uptake porin OprD. Here we show that such mutations can arise in clinical isolates even without prior carbapenem treatment, indicating that their effects during infection extend beyond antibiotic resistance. Consistent with this, we found that oprD mutants exhibit enhanced early attachment to and translocation across airway epithelial barriers in infection models, an effect maintained across strains with distinct clinical genomic backgrounds and infection dynamics. Our findings indicate that loss of OprD alters the bacterial outer membrane charge and reduces mucus entrapment, thereby facilitating epithelial barrier colonization.

The structure contains five disulfide bonds and four N-linked glycans, including one glycan that appears important for structural stability. Two extended loops form a surface for potential interactions with cell-surface receptors or other cellular factors.

Silvestrol strongly inhibited Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) replication in human A549 cells without cytotoxicity, expanding the list of arboviruses dependent on eIF4A.

Unlike most of its relatives, the spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii) lays eggs in ripening fruit, making it a serious and rapidly spreading agricultural pest worldwide. Spice plants produce volatiles that repel many insects, making them a potential source of D. suzukii behavioural modulators. Here, we examined whether volatiles from clove (Syzygium aromaticum) could alter the behaviour and fitness of D. suzukii. Behavioural assays revealed strong aversion: adults avoided grapes treated with clove extract, while gravid females laid significantly fewer eggs on treated fruit in both no choice and choice assays. Clove exposure adversely impacted fitness, resulting in slower larval growth, reduced adult weight, decreased emergence rate, and shortened lifespan. Gas Chromatography mass spectrometry analyses identified eugenol as the predominant volatile. Consistent with this, synthetic eugenol elicited strong avoidance not only in grapes but also across various host fruits, including apple, banana, blueberry, guava, mango, orange, papaya, raspberry, strawberry, and tomato. Furthermore, molecular docking and single-sensillum recordings indicated that eugenol binds most strongly to DsuzOR88a, followed by DsuzOR69a and DsuzOR23a odorant receptors. Subsequently, cheminformatic screening of 1,000 eugenol analogues revealed several structural variants predicted to interact strongly with OR88a, offering additional candidate repellents. By combining behavioural, analytical chemistry, electrophysiological, and cheminformatic approaches, our study demonstrates that clove, through its major volatile eugenol, disrupts host use and reduces fitness in D. suzukii.

In line with this observation, Piezo1 channels do not exhibit mechanical activation in the kind of lipids used in the structural studies. Here we show first that Piezo1 channels in cell-derived membranes retain functional mechanical gating, and second, that in cell-derived membranes they adopt a completely flattened disk shape associated with large conformational changes within and around the ion conduction pathway. These conformational changes occurring in cell-derived lipid membranes, suggest that mechanical force is necessary but insufficient, and that a specific membrane-derived cofactor apparently complements mechanical force to activate Piezo1.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

This manuscript characterizes drug potency and kinetics of ten oncology drugs in three different cancer cell lines and integrates in vivo pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models to identify how these parameters relate to real-world clinical outcomes. Our analyses revealed that Cmax normalization is necessary for concentration response data as IC50 alone does not account for drugs that are studied at sub-therapeutic concentrations. Additionally, the temporal effect of drug efficacy varies between cell lines and dose, where some drugs are unable to overcome the proliferation rate of the cells to induce a decrease in disease progression. This work aims to enhance the design and implementation of drug regimens by understanding the time-dependence of clinical efficacy and cytotoxicity.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

A.; Chavez Lopez, K.; Laubach, M.", "abstract": "Studies of visual discrimination learning decision making in rodents, particularly those using visual cues, can confound the effects of cue salience with reward value, making it difficult to determine which factor guides choice behavior. We addressed this issue using a two-alternative forced-choice task in which rats chose between visual cues associated with high or low sucrose rewards. After initial training with high (16 LEDs) and low (1 LED) luminance cues, we introduced a novel cue of intermediate luminance (4 LEDs) in a \"luminance shift\" test, keeping the associated reward values constant. We found that while rats maintained a preference for the higher-value option, the introduction of a perceptually more similar cue consistently reduced choice preference and eliminated latency differences compared to baseline. Using drift diffusion modeling, we determined that the luminance shifts primarily caused a reduction in the drift rate (the speed of evidence accumulation), reflecting increased difficulty in cue discrimination. This finding suggests that the visual salience of the options dictates the efficiency of evidence accumulation in value-based decisions. Furthermore, this effect on drift rate is notable because it shows a dissociation from our previous work (Palmer et al., 2024), where prefrontal cortex inactivation specifically affected the decision threshold but not the drift rate. Our results demonstrate that the relative salience of visual stimuli influences deliberation, with low-level perceptual features shaping the computational dynamics of value-based choice. Our findings clarify the distinct contributions of sensory input and prefrontal function in the decision process.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

The neural representation of vocalizations must therefore permit animals to generalize across one set of acoustic features to recognize meaning, and a different set of features to recognize vocalizer identity. To test this idea, we recorded the responses of gerbil core auditory cortex (AC) neurons to a large array (n>1500) of variants drawn from four vocalization categories and produced by 5 different families. Each vocalization category could be decoded from AC population activity with high accuracy, despite the acoustic variance across vocalization renditions or different families-of-origin, and displayed a 'boundary effect' (i.e., better classification across, than within, a category). Moreover, the family identity of each vocalization category could be decoded from a larger AC population. Thus, AC activity can be used to simultaneously predict vocalization category and family identity, and is robust to the natural range of acoustic variance.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Engaging endogenous thermoregulatory circuits to lower body temperature may overcome these limitations and modulate metabolism, offering an integrated approach to cerebroprotection. Here, we show that chemogenetic activation of neurons in the preoptic area (POA) elicits a torpor-like state in mice, characterized by sustained hypothermia and hypometabolism. In an animal stroke model, this endogenous hypothermic state significantly reduced infarct volume and improved motor outcomes compared to controls, whereas maintaining normothermia attenuated these protective effects. To explore metabolic mechanisms contributing to this state, we performed untargeted metabolomic profiling 30 minutes after POA activation and identified coordinated shifts in nucleotide, phospholipid, and sphingolipid pathways. These rapid, temperature-dependent changes indicate a metabolically reprogrammed state that may enhance neuronal resilience during ischemic stress. Together, our findings suggest that POA-driven hypothermia confers cerebroprotection through specific metabolic adaptations with translational potential.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated whether neuronal EVs can have a role in neuron-to-neuron communication during the development of neuron connectivity in mouse primary cortical neuron cultures. Our results demonstrate how miR-99a can regulate axonal growth via its EV-mediated delivery and through the targeting of HS3ST2, a heparan sulphate glucosamine 3-O-sulphotransferase, which is predominantly expressed in the brain and generates rare 3-O-sulphated domains in heparan sulphate proteoglycans, with growing importance in development and neurodegenerative mechanisms. Importantly, we show how in compartmentalised microfluidic cultures, where axons are isolated from neuronal somas, the growth-promoting effects of neuron-derived EVs are local to the axon. These findings establish that neuronal EVs can deliver miRNAs to discrete subcellular domains to acutely modulate local gene expression, thereby driving axonal growth and shaping neurodevelopment.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Metabolic parameters, body composition, liver histology, lipid profile, and markers of lipophagy were evaluated. The results demonstrate that liraglutide reduced body weight, fat mass, and lean mass, as well as food and caloric intake, fasting blood glucose, hepatic triglycerides (TG), steatosis, and fibrosis, improved the lipid profile and glucose tolerance, and increased lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) expression in the liver. Kombucha reduced lean mass, liver steatosis, hepatic TG, food and caloric intake, fasting blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and liver fibrosis, in addition to improving glucose tolerance. However, the combination of treatments did not show synergistic effects superior to those of liraglutide alone. Although liraglutide independently impacted LAL expression, none of the other lipophagy markers were modulated in the liver, suggesting that the beneficial mechanisms of action are independent of the lipophagy pathway. It is concluded that both liraglutide and kombucha are valid strategies for mitigating MASLD, but the combination does not offer superior advantages over liraglutide monotherapy.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

To supplement rDock, here we introduce the Intelligent RNA Interaction Scorer (IRIS), a regression model leveraging physicochemical and interaction-based features and trained on the largest dataset of experimental nucleic acid-ligand complexes compiled to date (1,356 structures). IRIS improves rDock RNA-ligand pose ranking relative to the use of rDock scores alone. We find that at least one of the 100 top generated poses for any given complex is within 2.0 angstrom RMSD of the native pose in 79.4% of test complexes. Of these 79.4%%, the default rDock scoring function ranks the correct pose first in 40.2% of cases. IRIS improves this latter fraction to 52.7% and increases the success rate for selecting a near-native pose among the top five ranked poses from 55.4% to 73.2%. IRIS thus significantly enhances pose ranking accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated into docking pipelines to refine ligand poses in RNA-targeted drug discovery.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Our Rhizarian isolate, Filoreta ramosa, develops an intricately branched network covering multiple centimeters in surface area. We investigated the development of its arborized morphology, focusing on cytoskeletal structure and organelle transport. Through live imaging, immunofluorescence, and drug perturbations, we show that conserved cytoskeletal proteins drive branching and development in a manner that mirrors the cytoskeleton of neuronal arbors, despite an estimated 1.2 billion years of evolutionary distance. Additionally, we demonstrate that its dynamic morphology is interdependent on branched microtubule arrays that facilitate rapid organelle transport, while actin-filled pseudopods enable nutrient uptake, new branch formation, and intercellular interactions.

Mediolateral cell intercalation is largely responsible for this morphogenetic process in vertebrates, but evidence suggests that additional cell-extrinsic forces generated by surrounding tissues contribute to the shaping of many structures. In zebrafish, for example, mechanical forces generated by the anteriorly migrating prechordal plate cooperate with tissue-autonomous cell intercalations to promote extension of the notochord. Here we propose a novel model for notochord morphogenesis by which mechanical epiboly forces within the enveloping layer are transmitted to the posterior end of the notochord via a cluster of dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) that physically links the two. We found that scattered or absent DFCs caused by loss of crb2a or sox32, respectively, reduces notochord C&E and exacerbates axis extension defects in planar cell polarity signaling-deficient embryos. Using an automated image segmentation and cell shape analysis pipeline, we show that cells within the posterior notochord fail to properly elongate when DFCs are scattered or absent. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of crb2a and sox32 fails to disrupt C&E of zebrafish embryonic explants in which no epiboly occurs and all extension is driven by cell-intrinsic behaviors. Together, these findings support a model in which DFCs facilitate mechanical coupling of the enveloping layer to the posterior notochord during epiboly to ensure robust morphogenesis of the notochord during gastrulation.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Null cln3 mutants have large cells, because they lack an activator, while hyperactive mutants have small cells. Whi5 inhibits Start.

The cln3 and whi5 deletions have off-setting phenotypes, such that the double mutant is nearly wild-type in cell size, and has only the mildest phenotype, with well-controlled cell size, despite entirely lacking two major cell size regulators.

S.", "abstract": "Individual variation in behavioral traits, commonly referred to as personality, is exhibited in numerous animal species, including invertebrates. The specific personality trait of exploration tendency may be affected by positive/optimistic or negative/pessimistic emotional states. Animal contests can induce these emotions, as winning against one's opponent increases 'optimism', while losing causes 'pessimism'; these states can then affect behavior in other contexts. Previous studies demonstrate that house crickets (Acheta domesticus) experience this winner-loser effect in fights, thus we investigated if a cricket's exploratory behavior is influenced by the outcome of its contest. We predicted that after a fight, winners would exhibit increased exploratory behavior due to an optimistic emotional state, while losers would show decreased exploratory behavior due to a pessimistic emotional state. Exploration tendency was measured as an individual's latency to exit a shelter. Crickets then participated in an aggression contest, with opponents chosen to be smaller or larger so that focal individuals either won (n=33) or lost (n=31), respectively. Latency to exit was again measured after the contest, as well as 48 h later to examine the persistence of winner-loser effects on exploration behavior over extended time periods. Latencies for control crickets (n=40) were measured at the same time points, but controls did not engage in a fight. In one of two years, winning crickets' latency times decreased following the contest, while losing crickets' latency times were not significantly affected. This suggests that individuals' emotional states were changed by the experience of winning a fight, which affected exploration tendencies, while losing a fight does not have an effect on exploration tendency. These data on invertebrate emotions have important implications for human health by allowing for future studies on the mechanisms behind mental states.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Its product DXP sits at a metabolic branchpoint between the biosynthesis of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), thiamin diphosphate (ThDP), and isoprenoids. DXP is formed via decarboxylation of pyruvate and subsequent carboligation with D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (D-GAP) in a ThDP-dependent manner. In the current mechanistic model, DXPS follows a ligand-gated mechanism. Pyruvate reacts with ThDP to form C-lactyl-ThDP (LThDP) which coincides with a shift to a closed conformation. The flexible spoon and fork motifs become ordered, situating the catalytic residue H299 within the active site which supports LThDP persistence and the closed conformation of the E-LThDP complex until binding of D-GAP. Our goal is to understand the molecular basis for stabilization of the E-LThDP complex in its closed conformation in the absence of D-GAP. We propose the conserved aromatic residues Y288, F298, and F304 in the E. coli DXPS spoon and fork motifs form a cluster upon the transition from the open to closed form to position H299 within the active site, necessary for LThDP persistence. Here, we conducted mutagenesis studies to elucidate the roles of Y288, F298, and F304 in conformational cycling and catalysis. On each variant, the conformational equilibrium favored an open state, hindered intermediate formation and persistence, and promoted intermediate release from the active site.

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of porous device design on the activation of primary human dermal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, a contractile cell that is a hallmark of fibrosis, over four weeks in culture. In particular two factors were studied 1) the introduction of nanoparticles, as they are increasingly being used for device functionalization, and 2) the polymer matrix, which dictates chemistry, mechanics and degradation. The addition of tantalum oxide (TaOx) nanoparticles (0-20wt%) had a minimal effect on fibroblasts, significantly down-regulating expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) (0.31 +/- 0.1), likely driven by the increase in nanoscale surface roughness. The polymer matrix of the device caused significant changes to myofibroblast activation, with the fast degrading polymer, poly(lactide co-glycolide) (PLGA) 50:50, significantly up-regulating multiple myofibroblast markers, including SMA (5.16 +/- 2.5), vinculin, integrin 1, and integrin 5, compared to non-degrading polycaprolactone (PCL).

It involves Pol{delta}-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis that produces 5' flaps, FEN1-mediated 5' flap cleavage, and LIG1-catalyzed nick ligation. Recently, we discovered that under stress conditions, yeast cells convert 5' flaps into 3' flaps, which are degraded by 3' flap nucleases to produce ligatable DNA nicks. However, little is known about this stress-induced, 3' flap-based OFM in human cells. Here, we report that 3' flaps frequently form in various human cancer cells, and that FEN1 deficiency significantly enhances 3' flap levels. XPF1 is recruited to the replication forks in FEN1 mutant or FEN1-chemically inhibited cells. Notably, XPF deficiency or inhibition in those defective cells leads to accumulation of 3' flaps, replication-related DNA strand breaks, and unique mutation signatures. Furthermore, XPF and FEN1 inhibitors show synergistic effects in killing human cancer cells. In summary, we demonstrate that 3' flap-based OFM is an important alternative of 5' flap-based OFM in mammalian cells. XPF is a key nuclease to degrade 3' flaps and complete OFM for survival.

Using a IS110 element from Caloranaerobacter azorensis, we show that IS110 transposons utilize two independent transposition pathways. The first depends on bridge-RNA and excises the element via copy-out to form a circular intermediate, revisiting the earlier cut-out model. Integration occurs predominantly through top-strand insertion, suggesting an alternative to the earlier Holliday junction-mediated dual-strand mechanism. The second involves cooperation between a truncated target-binding loop RNA and bridge-RNA, enabling direct top-strand transfer to a new target via two sequential reactions, bypassing circular intermediates. Both pathways preserve the original transposon copy. These findings redefine the mechanistic understanding of IS110 transposition and reconcile prior discrepancies, offering insight into programmable, RNA-guided genome modification.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

To bypass these limitations, leveraging native bacterial secretion systems to secrete proteins offers a promising alternative. The type 3 secretion system (T3SS) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium can secrete proteins at hundreds of milligrams per liter. While promising, higher titers from this and other natural systems are needed to be relevant commercially. A major engineering target to enhance protein secretion is the T3SS secretion apparatus. However, efforts to quantify its assembly are hindered by bottlenecks in scalability and complexity. Assembly involves ~20 structural proteins forming with precise stoichiometry under dynamic regulation. Membrane- and periplasmic-embedded components are difficult to probe without costly, time-intensive methods. To fully realize the T3SS as a tool for scalable protein production, new tools are needed for rapid and accurate characterization of the assembled apparatus. Here, we establish a high throughput flow cytometry method in S. Typhimurium by quantifying the abundance of the needle-bound tip protein SipD as a proxy for T3SS apparatus assembly. We then adapted a super resolution microscopy method, known as Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM), to visualize the presence of SipD and validate the flow cytometry results. Applying this approach, we revealed how overexpression of key T3SS regulators hilA and hilD impact assembly, expanded the assay with a secretion-compatible fluorescent reporter to link assembly with secretion, and uncovered how a PrgI variant impacts apparatus architecture.

Although macrophages are important for controlling GAS infection, we and others have demonstrated that GAS can persist in macrophages by perforating the phagolysosome using the pore-forming toxin streptolysin O (SLO). In this study, we examined how phagosomal perforation releases lysosomal and bacterial proteins into the cytosol and alters cytosolic protein content in the macrophage. Using IL-1{beta} as a measure of intracellular pathogen detection, we confirmed that cytosolic preparations from macrophages infected with either wild-type (WT) or SLO-deficient ({Delta}SLO) bacteria contained new proteins that are absent in uninfected cytosol controls. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct cytosolic protein profiles in both WT- and {Delta}SLO-infected macrophages. M1 protein was detected only in the cytosol of WT-infected macrophages and corresponded with the IL-1{beta} response, indicating SLO-mediated release of M1 protein from the phagosome, and providing a mechanism for cytosolic recognition of this virulence factor. Unexpectedly, cytosolic extracts of both WT- and {Delta}SLO-infected macrophages contained all histone proteins, suggesting that nucleosomal complexes are released into the cytosol during GAS infection. Our work reveals both a mechanism for the activation of the inflammatory response on a cellular level, and the surprising consequences of phagosomal perforation in GAS infections.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) senses nutrient availability, with amino acids serving as key signals. Lysosomes, which act as nutrient recycling centers, maintain amino acid homeostasis by breaking down macromolecules and releasing amino acids for cellular use. SLC38A9, a lysosomal amino acid transporter, functions as both a transporter and a sensor in the mTORC1 pathway. Here, we investigated whether SLC38A9 activity is regulated by pH. We show that arginine uptake by SLC38A9 is pH-dependent, and that the histidine residue His544 serves as the pH sensor. Mutating His544 abolishes the pH dependence of arginine uptake without impairing overall transport activity, indicating that His544 is not directly involved in substrate binding. Instead, protonation or deprotonation of His544 appears to influence transport through SLC38A9. To explore this mechanism, we compared two structures of SLC38A9 that we determined, one at high pH and one at low pH, and proposed a working model for pH-induced activation.

Two main conduction mechanisms have been proposed: the hard knock-on, in which ions traverse the selectivity filter in direct contact, and the soft knock-on, which involves co-permeation of water molecules. Using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations with the OPC water model, the AMBER19SB protein force field, and the 12-6-4 Sengupta et al. ion model, we observed that both hard and soft knock-on mechanisms are accessible and, notably, can reversibly transition in the MthK and KcsA channels across all simulated membrane potentials. These reversible transitions contrast with previous observations using the TIP3P water model, where water entry either disrupted conduction or was expelled, favoring exclusive hard knock-on events. Our results suggest that the choice of the water model, force field, and ion parameters significantly influences the observed conduction mechanism. Importantly, the coexistence of hard and soft knock-on in these simulations provides a potential reconciliation between structural data supporting hard knock-on and streaming potential measurements demonstrating water co-permeation. These findings reintroduce soft knock-on as a viable conduction mechanism and highlight the critical role of simulation parameters in reproducing potassium channel permeation behavior.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we benchmark Martini combined with ENMs or G[o] models on three folded proteins and show that both approaches struggle to sample the conformational space observed in atomistic simulations, even when uniform interaction strengths or equilibrium bond distances are adjusted. This limitation arises from the assumption of a uniform interaction network, in which all bond energies are equal.

Despite correlations between thermal performance traits having been reported in the literature for a few taxa and performance tasks, such as population growth rate, a comprehensive global analysis of the entire tree of life and multiple performance tasks remains an open challenge. To advance in this open question, we compile a database of 1,300 thermal response curves, encompassing 38 variable types related to individuals' performance (including per capita population growth rate, photosynthetic rate, among others) and 1,125 different species, ranging from viruses to mammals, encompassing all major lineages of the tree of life. Our analysis reveals that among all possible relationships between traits and optimal performance, four traits form a line with a high goodness-of-fit, while the remaining traits exhibit a polygonal pattern, either a triangle or a tetrahedron. We derive a thermodynamic framework that explains the relationships described by a curve or line (as opposed to a surface or polygon), highlighting the linear relationship between maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as between maximum and optimum temperatures. We also discuss other generic trait evolution models, which could account for the other significant sublinear relationships, as well as the more general model, Pareto optimality theory, which could account for relationships in the form of lines or polygons. Our theoretical framework and empirical evidence suggest that, based on a single data point (e.g., minimum temperature), all critical temperature limits and maximum performance boundaries can be predicted using the estimated parameter from this study.

In insects, internal water balance is regulated through the Malpighian tubules and the hindgut, which transport water and ions across their epithelia under the regulation of multiple peptide hormones. One of these, ion transport peptide (ITP), a member of the highly conserved crustacean hyperglycemic hormone superfamily among ecdysozoans, is an anti-diuretic hormone in insects, but its mechanism of action remains largely unclear. Here, we show that the short amidated isoform of ITP (saITP), secreted from brain neurosecretory cells, regulates water absorption via the receptor guanylyl cyclase (rGC) Gyc76C in the hindgut of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Both ITP and Gyc76C are evolutionarily conserved and are essential for larval survival in D. melanogaster, as mutation or knockdown of either gene results in early larval lethality. In Drosophila S2 cells, synthetic saITP increases intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) in a Gyc76C-dependent manner, an effect abolished by deletion of its putative ligand-binding domain. Using the fluorescent cGMP biosensor RedcGull in ex vivo-cultured hindguts, we found that saITP increases epithelial cGMP levels, and this response requires Gyc76C. Consistently, saITP promotes hindgut water reabsorption via Gyc76C. Thus, saITP acts via Gyc76C in a brain-hindgut neuroendocrine axis that regulates internal water balance during development.

Similar to other mouse models of human disease, Ndufs4-/- mice are routinely housed and studied at a subthermoneutral ambient temperature. This means that these mice experience chronic cold-stress, which potentially aggravates disease symptoms and reduces their translational value. Here, we provide evidence that housing Ndufs4-/- mice at 26 oC instead of 20 oC increases their skin, core and brain temperature. At this higher temperature, Ndufs4-/- mice displayed lower energy expenditure and, importantly, a longer lifespan, pathology reversal in specific brain regions, as well as increased voluntary locomotor activity. We conclude that ambient temperature is a previously overlooked but highly relevant disease modifier in Ndufs4-/- mice.

The balance between these phenotypes may vary depending on the chronicity or recurrence of infection in the same host. In this study, we investigated how latent Toxoplasma gondii (Tg) brain infection influences the course of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA). Our findings highlight an immunomodulatory role of GFAP positive astrocytes, which exhibited marked morphological and molecular alterations and adopted a unique intermediate reactive state (A1/A2). This hybrid state was associated with increased production of CXCL10 and TGF beta, which together controlled neuroinflammation without exacerbating parasitemia.

Here, we employ a third-generation FRET-based biosensor (TqLck-V2.3) to visualize Lck conformational dynamics in live T cells with high spatial resolution. Upon TCR engagement, we observe a paradoxical increase in whole-cell FRET signal, which immunolabeling reveals to be due to selective internalization of inactive Lck (pY505), while active Lck (pY394) remains membrane-associated and enriched at the immune synapse (IS). Using CD8 mutants that disrupt Lck binding, we demonstrate that free Lck undergoes more pronounced conformational activation than coreceptor-bound Lck. Furthermore, we show that C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) preferentially phosphorylates free Lck at Y505, while CD45 suppresses its activation via dephosphorylation of Y394, suggesting a dual regulatory mechanism that maintains free Lck in an inactive state under resting conditions. High-resolution imaging confirms sustained activation of Lck at the IS and transient inactivation at the periphery, revealing a spatially confined signaling architecture. These findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism involving selective internalization and spatial segregation of Lck conformations, and establish TqLck-V2.3 as a powerful tool for dissecting TCR signaling dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Routine serological screening, conducted in accordance with FELASA guidelines, plays a critical role in the detection of infectious agents. While conventional serological assays typically target individual pathogens, existing multiplex platforms often require specialized equipment and complex protocols, limiting their routine use within animal facilities. The MIRIAD assay is a multiplex ELISA-based platform developed for in-house serological surveillance of rodents. It offers a user-friendly, reliable, and cost-effective alternative to outsourced testing. In this study, we evaluated the performance and usability of the MIRIAD assay by analyzing serum samples from mice (n=68) and rats (n=27). Results were compared to two commercially available single-target ELISAs, with 94 % to 100 % concordance observed across all tested pathogens. Assay compatibility with dried blood spot (DBS) cards was also assessed, demonstrating reliable detection after storage and elution, and supporting the potential for reduced sample volumes and simplified handling. These findings highlight MIRIAD as a practical tool for routine health monitoring in laboratory animal facilities. Its ease of use, minimal sample requirements, and compatibility with DBS technology can facilitate more frequent testing, support early detection of pathogens, and promote adherence to the 3Rs principles through refinement of monitoring practices.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Despite decades of research, the cure rate of disease remains disappointingly low. This dismal prognosis is due to late detection and to resistance of tumors to all known systemic therapies. Here, we build upon our previous findings that highlighted the selective uptake of tumor-associated macrophage-derived exosomes by cancer cells. We hypothesize that the prominent lipid contents on the exosome surface play a crucial role in facilitating selective cellular interactions, offering a novel avenue for developing efficient drug delivery platforms for pancreatic cancer. Lipids' affinity toward cancer cells was measured, following mass spectral lipidomic analysis for screening the lipidic composition of macrophages and their derived exosomes. Subsequently, optimized and characterized synthetic exosomes underwent detailed intracellular trafficking studies in human pancreatic cancer cells, demonstrating enhanced cellular uptake kinetics. Notably, gemcitabine-loaded synthetic exosomes exhibited superior efficacy in inducing programmed cell death compared to both the free drug and conventional liposome formulations. The biodistribution examination of these synthetic exosomes underscored their potential for tumor specificity. In vivo experiments further demonstrated that the treatment with gemcitabine-incorporated synthetic exosomes inhibited tumor growth by nearly 50% compared to the administration of the free drug, indicating a significantly enhanced treatment efficacy. Our findings indicate that leveraging the lipid membrane composition of exosomes could lead to breakthroughs in drug delivery efficiency. This innovative strategy offers a promising direction in the ongoing battle against pancreatic cancer, highlighting the potential of exosomal lipid profiles for cancer therapy.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of NCP provided by terrestrial vertebrates on a large scale, and of the threats they face. To bridge this gap, we built a comprehensive dataset that documents the NCP provided by terrestrial vertebrate species in Europe, and analysed the conservation status and threats to NCP provider species. Location: Europe. Methods: We synthesised existing literature on NCP associated with European terrestrial vertebrates, and leveraged ecological traits and trophic interactions from previously established datasets. We identified 15 NCP (10 regulating NCP and 5 non-material NCP), with 860 species providing at least one NCP (out of 1,168 vertebrate species considered in total). Then, we harnessed species distribution data and a novel European land system map to create species-mediated NCP maps across Europe at a 1km resolution, including societal demand for each NCP. Results: We found that i) for each NCP, at least 25% of NCP provider species are assessed as threatened with extinction; ii) NCP multifunctionality is lowest in high-intensity land systems; and iii) direct exploitation and agricultural intensification are major threats to species-mediated NCP, impacting both non-material and regulating NCP provider species. Main conclusions: Protecting threatened NCP provider species, and reducing direct exploitation are key to maintain regulating and non-material NCP. Our results suggest that de-intensifying agricultural practices, through maintaining heterogeneous mosaic landscapes and promoting diversified practices, could increase NCP multifunctionality. Our work enables a comprehensive understanding of NCP provided by terrestrial vertebrates in Europe, their biogeography, and the threats they face, which can in turn inform spatial conservation planning to improve the conservation of both biodiversity and NCP.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

If hybrid vigor could be maintained across generations, it would revolutionize agriculture. A potential method to achieve this goal is asexual reproduction through seed (apomixis). We searched for mutants mimicking components of apomixis and here, we describe a novel meiotic mutant, non-reduction in female4 (nrf4) of Zea mays (maize), that produces unreduced female gametes - an essential component of apomixis. By combining the nrf4 mutant with the previously described matrilineal/not like dad (mtl/nld) mutant, which leads to embryo development without paternal contribution, we successfully produced clonal seeds. This is an important step towards the engineering of clonally propagated hybrids in maize, the most widely grown crop world-wide.

However, while cloud implementations have broadened access to these methods, there is still a lack of non-AI tools to systematically interpret and analyze the resulting data, especially under varying modeling contexts. Here, we present MultimerMapper, a pipeline and software suite designed to extract, integrate, analyze, and visualize the behavior of multimeric systems in ensembles of overlapping protein structure predictions. It utilizes statistics and graph theory, combined with novel approaches, to interpret how protein-protein interfaces and protein conformation behave across different modeling contexts. Starting from a list of input sequences, MultimerMapper guides users through the generation and interpretation of structure prediction ensembles. It produces interactive 2D and 3D visualizations, highlights higher-order subassemblies, infers probable stoichiometries, and identifies alternative interaction modes and conformational changes associated with the presence or absence of specific proteins. MultimerMapper is cross-platform, freely available, and easily integrates with existing workflows. It offers a new perspective on the dynamic nature of predicted protein complexes, supporting researchers in the exploration of functional mechanisms and assembly paths.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

A systematic map of hallmark gene mutation-defined cancer dependencies and therapeutic responses is essential to uncover novel targets and refine therapeutic strategies. Here, we present the first pan-cancer blueprint of hallmark vulnerabilities, systematically linking hallmark gene mutation markers to cancer cell dependencies and drug sensitivities across 22 cancer cohorts. We integrated multi-omics data from patient tumours with large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens and pharmacologic profiling of over a thousand cancer cell lines. Our analysis revealed the cancer type-specific nature of hallmark gene expression programs, uncovered previously unrecognised mutation-target gene dependencies, and highlighted metabolic programs as a dominant class of functional vulnerabilities. Notably, we identified oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) addiction in CDKN2A-loss lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and experimentally validated this dependency. Our validation highlights the greater selectivity of CDKN2A-loss LUSC cells to metformin, an FDA-approved antidiabetic drug known for its OXPHOS inhibitory activity. Proteogenomic integration further prioritised targets overexpressed in mutant tumours, constituting therapeutic windows. Pharmacologic profiling identified both oncology and non-oncology agents with selective activity in mutation-defined subgroups, revealing opportunities for drug repurposing. Our machine learning framework, Comet-X, for the first time fully leveraged gene mutation combinations to predict these target dependencies and drug responses. The resulting pan-cancer mutation-dependency map provides a comprehensive resource of hallmark gene targets and candidate therapeutics, stratified by mutation markers, to pave the way for drug development, clinical trial design and discovery research.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

J.; Adegoke, O. A. J.", "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is critical to whole-body functionality and homeostasis. The mammalian /mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a nutrient and growth/factor sensitive positive regulator of skeletal muscle mass. Amongst other substrates, mTORC1 phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1). Activated S6K1 acts through multiple effectors, including programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), to activate mRNA translation and protein synthesis. Much of what is known about PDCD4 is in non-muscle cells. We previously demonstrated that the effect of PDCD4 differs between myoblasts and myotubes. Here, we showed that PDCD4 depletion in L6 and C2C12 myotubes enhanced myotube diameter (+36%) and accumulation of myofibrillar proteins (+163 to 237%). These effects occurred along with increased phosphorylation of AKTser473 (+85%) and of the mTORC1 substrate S6K1thr389 (+152%), but protein synthesis was suppressed. There was increased phosphorylation of FoxO3aser253 (+250%) and a corresponding reduction in the expression of the muscle protein ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 (44%), but there was no significant effect on measures of proteolysis or autophagy. In starved myotubes treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins was attenuated in PDCD4-depleted cells. PDCD4 depletion did not augment measures of myotube contraction but was associated with reduced ATP and intracellular amino acid levels. Finally, AKT inhibition partially attenuated the effect of PDCD4 depletion on myofibrillar protein abundance. In summary, myofibrillar protein accumulation in PDCD 4-depleted myotubes did not lead to improved myotube function, likely due to reduced energy level. Our data point to a pivotal role for PDCD4 in regulating myotube size and metabolism.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Using a conditioned punishment task in male and female rats, we replicate findings of a bimodal distribution of punishment avoidance, and identify four distinct behavioural phenotypes (Sensitive, Hypersensitive, Insensitive, Generalised) that differed in their punishment avoidance, unpunished reward-seeking, and Pavlovian fear. We examined how these phenotypic differences related to c-Fos (transcriptional activity marker) across prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions. While region-level c-Fos differences were minimal, covariance and graph-theoretic analyses revealed three functional PFC networks predominantly composed of medial PFC, ventrolateral PFC, or sensorimotor regions. Activity in the ventrolateral PFC network predicted punishment avoidance, while activity in the medial PFC network predicted generalised suppression during initial punishment learning. These findings suggest phenotypic differences in punishment sensitivity is underpinned by differential recruitment of distinct cortical networks that drive adaptive versus maladaptive responses to negative outcomes.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

The effect of the altered lipidome on the skin resident immune cells that drive disease is unclear. Previous reports identified Fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) as a biomarker for atopic dermatitis, yet how FABP5 might contribute to disease pathogenesis is unknown. Here, we use a murine model of atopic dermatitis, to demonstrate that FABP5 is highly expressed in immune and epithelial cell lineages and that FABP5 protects against skin inflammation. Lipidomic analysis revealed that FABP5 deficiency broadly disrupts the systemic abundance of ether-linked lipids, a minor but important subset of glycerophospholipids. We show that these changes in ether lipid abundance are crucial for the proper regulation of platelet activating factor (PAF), a potent inflammatory ether lipid derivative. Concordantly, we observe elevated PAF in FABP5-deficient mice with dermatitis and that depletion of basophils, a major source of PAF, is sufficient to ameliorate disease in these animals. Altogether, our findings reveal a novel role for FABP5 in the control of allergic inflammation through the modulation of ether lipid and PAF metabolism.", "date": "2025-10-25", "journal": ""}

Using perturbation-response data and curated prior knowledge, we trained interpretable models to identify signaling mechanisms that enhance CXCL9 expression and prioritize drug combinations. Active learning enabled data-efficient model refinement and guided informative experiments under resource constraints. Benchmarking on synthetic data and experimental validation confirmed the performance of different acquisition strategies and revealed cell line-specific regulatory differences.
