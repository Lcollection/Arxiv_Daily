Recently, the development of human endometrial assembloids has provided a powerful model to examine this intricate biological process. In this study, we established a specialized human window-of-implantation (WOI) endometrial assembloid system that mimics the in vivo receptive endometrium. It recapitulates not only the structural attributes of pinopodes and cilia, but also molecular characteristics of mid secretory endometrium. Furthermore, the WOI endometrial assembloid exhibits hormone responsiveness, energy metabolism with larger and enhanced functional mitochondria, increased ciliary assembly and motility, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as well as promising potential for embryo implantation. As such, WOI assembloids hold great promise as a platform to unravel the intricate mechanisms governing endometrial receptivity regulation, maternal-fetal interactions, and associated diseases, ultimately driving impactful advancements in the field.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

For example, heatwaves may suppress reproduction, leading to recruitment failure before lethal temperatures are reached. Despite a growing awareness of this issue, tying sublethal effects to observed recruitment failure remains a challenge especially in marine environments. We experimentally show that sublethal suppression of female gametogenesis by marine heatwaves can partially explain historical collapses in urchin recruitment. This response differed by sex but was similar between animals from warmer or cooler regions of their range.

Transient postnatal depletion of these monocytes resulted in heightened IL-17A production by skin T cells, which was particularly sustained among CD4+ T cells and sufficient to exacerbate inflammatory skin pathologies. Neonatal skin monocytes were enriched in expression of negative regulators of the IL-1 pathway. Functional in vivo experiments confirmed a key role for excessive IL-1R1 signaling in T cells as contributing to the dysregulated type 17 response in neonatal monocyte- depleted mice.

If uncertainty is caused by randomness in outcomes (noise), observed events should have less influence on beliefs, whereas if uncertainty is caused by a change in the process being estimated (volatility) the influence of events should increase. Previous work has demonstrated that humans respond appropriately to changes in volatility, but there is less evidence of a rational response to noise. Here we test adaptation to variable levels of volatility and noise in human participants, using choice behaviour and pupillometry as a measure of the central arousal system. We find that participants adapt as expected to changes in volatility, but not to changes in noise. Using a Bayesian observer model, we demonstrate that participants are, in fact, adapting to estimated noise, but that their estimates are imprecise, leading them to misattribute it as volatility and thus to respond inappropriately.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

While the significance of CF input in motor memory formation is widely acknowledged, a comprehensive understanding of its distinct contribution across different temporal windows, spanning from the initial learning phase to the retrieval period, remains incomplete. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the necessity of CF-induced instructive signals in motor learning by assessing their roles in memory acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval. We employed optogenetics to selectively inhibit CF transmission during targeted time windows. Consequently, the absence of CF-induced instructive signals during motor learning impairs memory acquisition.

While seminal work described that oncogenic RAS transformation drives synthetic lethal vulnerability to archetypal ferroptosis inducers including erastin (eradicator of RAS and ST-expressing cells) and RSL3 (Ras selective lethal 3), more recent work suggest that oncogenic RAS signaling may confer ferroptosis resistance. Thus, the impact of oncogenic RAS on the cellular response to ferroptosis is still unclear. Here, we provide unifying evidence across multiple cellular models that oncogenic RAS signaling suppresses ferroptosis. Using integrated proteo- and transcriptomic analyses, we uncovered that oncogenic RAS signaling upregulates the ferroptosis suppressor GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) via transcriptional induction by the transcription factor ETS1 downstream of the RAS-MAPK signaling cascade. Targeted repression of Gch1 or of the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis pathway, which is mediated by GCH1, was sufficient to sensitize oncogenic RAS transformed cells to ferroptosis in 2D and 3D cell models, highlighting a mechanism through which RAS promotes resistance to ferroptosis induction. Furthermore, we found that GCH1 expression is clinically relevant and correlates with RAS signaling activation in human cancers. Overall, this study redefines oncogenic RAS signaling to be a ferroptosis suppressor, and identifies GCH1 as a mediator of this effect and a potential vulnerability for targeting RAS driven cancers.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we compare the growth properties of Clade 5 strains to those of Clade 1-4 strains using anaerobic time-lapse microscopy coupled with automated image analysis. Our analyses indicate that Clade 5 strains grow faster and are more likely to form long chains of cells than Clade 1-4 strains. Using comparative genomic and CRISPRi analyses, we show that the chaining phenotype of Clade 5 strains is driven by the orientation of the invertible cmr switch sequence, with chaining strains exhibiting a bias to the cmr-ON state. Interestingly, Clade 5 strains with a bias towards the cmr-ON state shifted to a largely cmr-OFF state during murine infection, suggesting that the cmr-OFF state is under positive selection during infection. Collectively, our data reveal that Clade 5 strains have distinct growth properties, which may allow them to inhabit diverse ecological niches.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Genome-wide, clonal evolution was associated with clone-specific gradual modulation of chromatin states and expression levels, with a surprising preferential trend of reversing the prior changes observed at the early leukemic stage. We leveraged clonal specificity of these modulation patterns to focus on the core gene set of potential growth regulators with consistent changes of expression and chromatin marks that were maintained in vivo and ex vivo in both independent clones.

Different decision strategies can be used to merge these choice attributes with personal preferences (e.g., risk preferences) and integrate them into a single subjective value. While the influence of dopamine on risk preferences has been investigated, it is unknown whether dopamine is also involved in arbitrating between decision strategies. Objective In the present study, we investigate the effects of pharmacological manipulation of dopamine transmission on arbitrating between different decision strategies in a sample of healthy humans. Methods 31 healthy male participants performed a reward-guided decision-making task under the influence of the dopamine D2/D3-receptor antagonist amisulpride (400 mg), the dopamine precursor L-DOPA (100 mg L-DOPA + 25 mg cardidopa), or placebo in a double-blind within-subject design. The effect of dopamine on reward-guided decisions and decision strategies was analyzed using hierarchical implementations of regressions and Bayesian models. Results We observed that the dopaminergic manipulations shifted the (overall) weighting of option attributes without changing how option attributes are integrated into a subjective value (decision strategy). These effects were bidirectional: Amisulpride reduced whereas L-DOPA increased the degree to which choices were influenced by both reward magnitude and reward probability. These effects occurred in the absence of changes in statistically optimal behavior. Conclusion Together, our data provide evidence for a role of dopamine in controlling the influence of value parameters on choice irrespective of decision strategies.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

It is often envisaged that a simple linear counterbalance of cell generated stress with extracellular matrix (ECM) traction forces exists. However, experimental evidence indicates that modulating cell-ECM attachment does not necessarily lead to expected reciprocal changes in intercellular stresses. As ECM composition or mechanical properties are rarely uniform, it is important to understand the complexity of how focal adhesions alter stress transmission and the force-balance of a tissue. To address this, we confined monolayers on adhesive patterns altering focal adhesion distribution. Traction force microscopy and laser ablations of cell-cell junctions were used to examine stresses across epithelial monolayers whilst modulating substrate stiffness. We show that monolayers reach different force-balance states depending on focal adhesion distribution. Using an active matter model and confirmed experimentally, we reveal that a force-balance is generated by non-uniform patterns of cell contractility linked to adhesion patterning. This work highlights the importance of integrating the position of cell-ECM attachments into our vision of the mechanical landscape of living tissues.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Given the integral role of RNA, its repair is essential for maintaining proper cell function. A highly conserved RNA repair system, the Rtc system, maintains core RNA components of the translational apparatus. Rtc expression is induced upon various stresses, including exposure to ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Its expression enables cells to rescue growth and survive treatment by conferring transient resistance to these antibiotics. The mechanisms by which Rtc-induced resistance arises are largely unknown. Here, we develop and analyse a computational model of Rtc-regulated maintenance of long-lived RNAs that form part of the translational apparatus. We investigate the mechanistic action of Rtc leading to transient resistance and find that its regulatory structure promotes heterogeneity across bacterial populations, where a resistant sub-population can co-exist with non-expressing, susceptible cells. We provide experimental evidence of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in rtc expression and effects on the translational activity of cells. The finding reveals a complex response underlying adaptive resistance conferred by Rtc with individual cell fates determining antibiotic efficacy. We further analyse the molecular determinants that lead to growth rescue vs suppression and identify components within the Rtc system that may be targeted to potentiate antibiotic effects.

The RIP assay, mRNA stability assay and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. We demonstrated that phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) promoted metastasis and EMT progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpresssed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting-RNAs, and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET.

To produce a more realistic and comprehensive view of the protein diversity in the viral world, we have (i) collected thousands of viromes and identified viral contigs and proteins within them, (ii) retrieved viral proteins available in different public databases, and (iii) applied sensitive similarity searches to cluster all these proteins into families and (iv) annotated the protein clusters produced. More than 46 million deduplicated proteins were clustered into less than 2.3 million protein families. After further removing genomic sequences likely of cellular origin using an iterative procedure, the remaining 2,203,457 clusters were coined enVhogs (for environmental Viral homologous groups).

Accumulating evidence suggests that the dense and mechanically stiff tumor microenvironment promotes nuclear deformation in cancer cells. However, little is known about how nuclear deformation in neoplastic cells regulates immune exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we found that lamin A/C-mediated nuclear stiffening in neoplastic cells promotes the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (pFAK), which is strongly correlated with the heterogeneity and exhaustion of CD8+ T cells within the spatial context of the tumor microenvironment in human colorectal cancer. Mechanistically, we revealed that increased nuclear tension within tumor cells promotes pFAK nuclear translocation, where nuclear pFAK was found to regulate SP1/IL-6-mediated T-cell exhaustion and the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Pharmacological inhibition or disruption of pFAK nuclear translocation enhanced antitumor immune responses and synergistically potentiated PD-1 and TIM-3 immunotherapy by increasing CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity and restoring exhaustion in preclinical models of colorectal cancer. These findings highlight the pivotal role of nuclear tension-mediated pFAK translocation into the tumor cell nucleus in regulating CD8+ T-cell exhaustion, suggesting that pFAK is a promising target for advancing cancer immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

S.; Dognini, E.; Marcantoni, E.; Bortoletto, M.", "abstract": "Background: Combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is widely used to probe cortical excitability at the network level, but technical challenges have prevented its application to investigate local excitability of the stimulated area. A recent study revealed immediate TMS-evoked potentials (i-TEPs) after primary motor cortex (M1) stimulation, suggesting that it may represent a local response. Here, we aimed at testing if this activity is physiological in nature and what it represents. Methods: We analyzed a TMS-EEG dataset from 28 healthy participants recorded at 9.6 kHz including two M1 stimulation conditions with opposite biphasic current directions. We localized the brain sources of i-TEPs, calculated the immediate TMS-related power (i-TRP) to distinguish between two oscillatory components that may contribute to i-TEPs, and investigated the relationship between i-TRP and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). In an additional recording, we stimulated a control site evoking a muscular response to understand the contribution of the TMS-related muscle artifact. Results: Results confirmed i-TEPs with similar characteristics as previously described. The i-TRP revealed strong activity in two ranges 600-800 Hz and 100-200 Hz; The former was positively associated with MEPs amplitude for both current direction conditions. Moreover, i-TEPs were localized in the precentral gyrus of the stimulated hemisphere and the muscular response generated by the control stimulation site differed from i-TEPs and i-TRP. Discussion: These findings provide first evidence on the physiological nature of i-TEPs and i-TRP following M1 stimulation and that i-TRP represents a direct measure of excitability of the stimulated cortex.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Despite its pivotal role as a driver of speciation, the role of synteny breaks on speciation is poorly studied due to a lack of chromosome-level genome assemblies for a taxonomically broad sample of organisms. Here, using 22 congeneric animal genome pairs, we find a link between protein identity, microsynteny, and macrosynteny, but no evidence for a universal path of genomic change during divergence. We observed varied trajectories of synteny conservation relative to protein identity in non-model organisms, with many species pairs showing no karyotypic changes and others displaying large genomic rearrangements. This contrasts with previous studies on model organisms and indicates that the genomic changes preceding or resulting from speciation are likely very contextual between clades.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Studies in urban ecology and evolution often rely on generic indices of urbanization to characterize biodiversity patterns along urban-rural gradients. However, these indices do not permit explicit tests of causal hypotheses by which urbanization mediates ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we show how a graphical causal modeling framework with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to design clear conceptual models to better evaluate mechanistic hypotheses about the effects of urbanization on biodiversity. We introduce the basic structure of DAGs and illustrate their value, first with simulated data and then with a case study on coat color variation in eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) along an urbanization gradient in Syracuse, New York, USA. We show how univariate statistical models with generic urbanization predictors are difficult to interpret and can lead to misleading conclusions about mechanisms in urban ecology and evolution. In contrast, DAGs make causal assumptions transparent and can point to specific processes driving biodiversity patterns. When applied to our case study, analyses informed by a DAG revealed a surprising finding: although squirrel melanism was more prevalent in urban than rural populations, the prevalence of melanism was constrained by components of environmental change common to cities, namely roads, forest loss, and predator activity, in contrast to expectations. Managing biodiversity in an increasingly urbanized world will require a mechanistic understanding of how urbanization impacts biodiversity patterns; graphical causal models can provide a powerful approach to do so.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

However, its applicability in ecological research has been questioned over the sometimes large number of species falsely identified. Using species-specific confidence thresholds has been identified as a powerful approach to solving this issue. However, determining these thresholds is time and resource-consuming. While optimising the parameter setting of the algorithm could be an alternative strategy, the effect of parameter settings on the algorithm's performance is not well understood. Here, we compared the species identification of BirdNET against expert identification using an acoustic dataset comprising 930 minutes of recordings collected in Munich, Germany. The performance of BirdNET was evaluated using three performance metrics: precision, recall, and F1-score. The metrics were calculated using 24 combinations of the parameters: week, sensitivity, and overlap at four temporal aggregations (pooling of data across time intervals) to also test the effects of recording length. We found that BirdNET closely matched expert identification, particularly when given more data (higher temporal aggregation, F1 score = 0.84) and when including the parameters week of the year, a suitable sensitivity, and an overlap of one to two seconds. Thus, while there are still limitations, using appropriate parameter settings and recording durations, BirdNET yields results comparable to experts without the need for time-consuming estimation of species-specific thresholds. This approach offers reliable presence-absence data in a fast and efficient way while species-specific thresholds are not readily available.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

We report here that each transcript has a distinct role in Drosophila testes; the increased expression of Peony results in the disruption of the muscle sheath covering the testis, and the absence of miR-317 leads to the emergence of germ-cell tumors in developing flies. The deficiency of miR-317 increases Notch signaling activity in somatic cyst cells, upregulates multiple predicted targets of miR-317, and drives germline tumorigenesis.

However, as research increasingly prioritises the development of models that best explain observed behaviour, the question of whether these behaviours stem from biologically plausible brain functions has often been overlooked. To address this gap, we developed a probabilistic two-armed bandit task model based on the active inference framework and compared its performance to established reinforcement learning (RL) models. Our model demonstrated superior explanatory power in capturing individual variability in choice behaviour. A key parameter in our model, policy precision-analogous to the temperature parameter in RL models-is also optimised based on previous outcomes. This optimisation accounts for the balance between model-free (MF) and model-based (MB) decision-making strategies. Notably, incorporating the rate of change in policy precision enhanced the model's ability to explain brain network dynamics and their inter-subject correlations. Specifically, we observed a positive correlation with default mode network dominance and a negative correlation with dorsal attention and frontoparietal network-dominant states. These opposing network patterns suggest a cooperative relationship, as evidenced by correlations between state transitions and behavioural parameters. This transition may represent a neural mechanism underlying MB-MF arbitration, which appears to be disrupted by prolonged activation of another state characterised by heightened ventral attention network activity and increased inter-network connectivity. Finally, we found that reduced prior policy precision in loss-related context is associated with suicidal ideation in individuals with major depressive disorders.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Systematic detection of somatic MEIs, particularly those with low mosaicism, remains a significant challenge. Previous methods had required a high number of supporting reads which limits the detection sensitivity, or human inspections that are susceptible to biases. Here, we developed RetroNet, an algorithm that encodes MEI-supporting sequencing reads into images, and employs a deep neural network to identify somatic MEIs with as few as two reads. Trained on extensive and diverse datasets and benchmarked across various conditions, RetroNet surpasses previous methods and eliminates the need for extensive manual examinations.

Despite long-standing interest, the impact of sex-specific selection on the transcriptome remains poorly understood. Here, we test fundamental questions on the role of constraints on gene expression evolution arising from the mode of selection and genetic architecture. We also test the relationship between sex-biased expression and evolved sexual dimorphism (SD). We assess these using body size selection lines in the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, that have evolved variation in SD in response to either sex-limited (SL) or sexually antagonistic (SA). We find that sex differences in the phenotypic responses and expression changes are generally well aligned. SL selection, despite a phenotypic response similar to SA selection in males, but not in females, resulted in a more extensive expression differentiation and increase of sex-biased expression than SA selection. These patterns show that SA selection imposes a transcriptomic constraint and is not required for sex-bias to evolve. Sex-biased transcripts show lower cross-sex correlations in expression changes than unbiased transcripts, suggesting greater sex differences in their underlying genetic architecture. Although male-biased transcripts are disproportionately affected when selection targeted males, we find no support for a transcriptome-wide association between sex-bias and SD. In the light of these unique experimental insights into how sex-specific selection on size changes adult transcription, our findings have important implications for inferring selection history and mode from patterns of sex-biased gene expression in natural populations.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Abrogation of functional sporophytic AROs results in a phenotypic pattern strongly reminiscent of CNGC dysfunction, including defects in root gravitropism, root hair growth and morphology, stomatal movement, and responses to extracellular ATP and the phytohormone auxin. aro2/3/4 mutants are fully resistant to the toxic effects caused by overexpression of CNGCs.

ADAM22 is a membrane receptor that binds to LGI1 extracellularly and interacts with AMPA-type glutamate receptors via PSD-95 intracellularly to maintain normal synaptic signal transmission. Structural analysis of the LGI1-ADAM22 complex is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of epileptogenesis and developing new therapies against epilepsy. We previously reported the crystal structure of a 2:2 complex consisting of two molecules of LGI1 and two molecules of the ADAM22 ectodomain (ECD), which is suggested to bridge neurons across the synaptic cleft.

Here, we investigated how such explicit reliability markers are integrated in decision-making and the extent to which individuals have metacognitive insight into this process. We developed a novel paradigm where participants viewed the opinions from sources of varying reliability to decide between two options. After each decision, they rated how much a given source influenced their choice. Using computational modelling, we found that participants systematically misrepresented source reliability, inflating the likelihood that a source would provide correct information. They were also biased by unreliable sources of information, even when they were explicitly labelled as random. Additionally, sources that were labelled as reliably wrong, suggesting consistently the incorrect answer, impaired performance even though participants knew that they could use them to infer the correct choice. This effect was captured by an increased recency in the evidence accumulation process likely due to increased memory load when those sources were present. Despite these biases, participants showed metacognitive awareness of what influenced their choices: they were generally accurate in reporting how much a source influenced them and were aware of the impact of unreliable sources on their decisions.

Beyond their classical definition as markers of the pericentromeric heterochromatin, the three mammalian HP1 proteins have been requalified as regulators of several co-transcriptional processes occurring on chromatin such as alternative splicing. We uncover here a novel association of HP1 with the nuclear RNA exosome, a complex involved in RNA degradation. Mouse embryonic liver-derived cells depleted in all three HP1 proteins displayed increased levels of various RNA species genome-wide, showing stabilization of transcripts from retrotransposon-like repeated elements and stabilization of certain gene- and enhancer-associated transcripts. Our results demonstrate that the RNA exosome interacts with HP1 proteins and is targeted to chromatin loci through HP1-dependent mechanisms, leading to the degradation of unstable chromatin-associated transcripts. Detection of such transcripts in the absence of HP1 was correlated with a gain in chromatin accessibility, as defined by ATAC-seq. The consequent increased activity of nearby genomic elements corresponding to poised liver enhancers resulted in an upregulation of genes expressing extracellular matrix components such as Col6a1 and Col6a2. In our re-analysis of a previous hepatocellular carcinoma study, patients with the highest levels of inflammation showed reduced HP1 levels and less RNA degradation. This reduction leads to tumors with unique characteristics linked to collagen gene upregulation, being potentially more rigid and exhibiting lower proliferation.

Experimental studies have suggested that S768I and D761N are oncogenic, whereas S768N is likely a neutral mutation that does not significantly alter EGFR activity. Our simulation results were consistent with these functional indications and provided the corresponding molecular bases - S768I and S768N affect the orientation and stability of the catalytically important C-helix, while D761N introduces a new hydrogen bonding network between the C-helix and activation loop. Collectively, the protocol presented here provides a robust and rapid framework for characterizing EGFR mutation mechanisms and is readily adaptable to novel or uncharacterized variants.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

M.; Moghimi, M.; Laurent, G.", "abstract": "Cephalopod chromatophores are small dermal neuromuscular organs, each consisting of a pigment-containing cell and 10-20 surrounding radial muscles. Their expansions and contractions, controlled and coordinated by the brain, are used to modify the animals appearance during camouflaging and signaling. Building up on tools developed by this lab, we propose a flexible computational pipeline to track and analyze chromatophore dynamics from high-resolution videos of behaving cephalopods. This suite of functions, which we call CHROMAS, segments and classifies individual chromatophores, compensates for animal movements and skin deformations, thus enabling precise and parallel measurements of chromatophore dynamics and long-term tracking over development. A high-resolution tool for the analysis of chromatophore deformations during behavior reveals details of their motor control and thus, their likely innervation. When applied to many chromatophores simultaneously and combined with statistical and clustering tools, this analysis reveals the complex and distributed nature of the chromatophore motor units. We apply CHROMAS to the skins of the bobtail squid Euprymna berryi and the European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, illustrating its performance with species with widely different chromatophore densities and patterning behaviors. More generally, CHROMAS offers many flexible and easily reconfigured tools to quantify the dynamics of pixelated biological patterns.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

This protocol aims to identify novel therapeutic targets and enhance the diagnosis and stratification of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby optimizing their treatment with anti-seizure medications and surgical interventions. Methods: Patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, recommended for surgical treatment, are recruited after detailed multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation at the Epilepsy Center at Kuopio University Hospital in Finland. A day before the resective surgery, patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including advanced methodologies. During the surgery, each piece of resected tissue is placed under oxygenation on ice-cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid-solution. The pieces are then immediately transported to the laboratory, assessed by a neuropathologist, and sliced for both clinical diagnosis and research. Two adjacent slices are provided for research and are sent to the University of Eastern Finland. Results: The developed sample handling protocol provides the opportunity for detailed characterization of the tissue from the same patient using emerging imaging, electrophysiology, and molecular biology technologies. We have optimized the conditions for preserving the resected tissue alive for electrophysiological measurements and simultaneously making possible ex vivo studies including multi-omics acquisition, electron microscopy, histology, and MRI. Our protocol enables the mapping of functional readouts to structural and molecular alterations in human tissue. Our goal is to integrate multimodal data and co-register the resected tissues within the whole brain's in vivo MRI space. This approach aims to enhance the characterization and localization of epileptogenic zones and refine surgical treatment targets by identifying abnormalities in global connectivity and structural patterns. Significance: We have successfully developed a systematic protocol for the collection and analysis of multimodal data.

We employed a multimodal approach combining high-density EEG, respiratory and behavioral monitoring, and first-person reports across three conditions: baseline resting state, progressive hypnotic induction (Light and Deep phases), and an ideomotor challenge comparing a hypnotically suggested arm catalepsy to a voluntary simulation. EEG results revealed that light hypnosis was associated with early parieto-occipital alpha suppression and increased theta-band activity. As hypnosis deepened, frontoparietal connectivity increased while parasympathetic activation declined, challenging the view of hypnosis as a passive, low-arousal state and instead pointing to active top-down reorganization of large-scale brain networks. During the ideomotor phase, participants exhibited distinct patterns of behavioral responsiveness, classified as tremblers and non-tremblers, despite reporting comparable disruptions in the sense of agency; phenomenological analyses corroborated these distinctions by uncovering divergent experiential strategies. Tremblers showed increased frontoparietal gamma activity and reduced delta connectivity, suggesting heightened sensorimotor integration and greater executive monitoring under motor conflict. Together, these findings show that hypnosis engages dynamic top-down processes that reconfigure both neural connectivity and subjective experience, supporting predictive coding accounts of agency disruption and highlighting the value of neurophenomenological methods for advancing consciousness science and informing clinical applications.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Baseline serum samples were collected prior to ICI initiation and profiled using a multiplex cytokine panel. Logistic regression, Cox regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were employed to assess associations between cytokine levels, therapeutic response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Gene expression levels of key cytokines were validated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using quantitative real-time PCR.\n\nResultsElevated baseline levels of IL-2, IL-23, and sPD-L1 were significantly associated with clinical response to ICI therapy. Among these, sPD-L1 emerged as an independent predictor of response (AUC = 0.87). Multivariate Cox regression showed IL-2 (HR = 0.67), sPD-L1 (HR = 0.15), and IL-23 (HR = 1.18) were significantly associated with PFS and also predictive of OS. Notably, combined profiling of IL-2 and sPD-L1 enhanced predictive power (AUC = 0.95 for both PFS and OS). RT-PCR analysis of PBMCs corroborated these findings, confirming upregulation of IL-2 in responders and elevated IL-23 expression in non-responders.\n\nConclusionBaseline cytokine profiling--particularly of IL-2, sPD-L1, and IL-23--provides important prognostic and predictive information in advanced NSCLC patients undergoing ICI therapy.

Here, we present color and intensity modulation with split fluorescent proteins for cell labeling (Caterpie), a live cell labeling system that enables high-fidelity identification of multiple cell populations through rational design of split fluorescent proteins. Drawing inspiration from human trichromatic vision, we engineered optimized split fluorescent protein variants (split CFP2, split mNG3A, and split sfCherry3C) and developed a comprehensive library of the 11th {beta}-strand (FP11) tags comprising variable numbers of tandem repeats. Structure-guided protein engineering enhanced the performance of split mNG3A and split sfCherry3C through targeted modifications of their C-terminal sequences and binding interfaces, respectively. By systematically varying the composition and arrangement of FP11 repeats, we selected 20 distinct FP11 tags that enable robust cell population discrimination with 97% accuracy using conventional fluorescence microscopy. In these FP11 tag-expressing cells, we expressed multiple EGF ligands and their receptors and cultured them in bulk to examine the effects of EGF signaling on chemotaxis within the cell population. The results showed that chemotaxis changes according to the intensity of EGFR signaling.

P.", "abstract": "N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is present in food, water, and drugs and is considered a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The mechanism of action of NDMA involves the generation of carcinogenic methyl lesions such as 3-methyladenine (3MeA) on DNA bases. Alkyladenine DNA Glycosylase (AAG) removes 3MeA to initiate Base Excision Repair, leaving an intermediary lesion that is subsequently resolved by backbone cleavage, nucleotide insertion, and backbone ligation. The intermediate steps following lesion removal produce potentially toxic and mutagenic single-strand DNA breaks. Here, we explored differences between males and females regarding downstream DNA damage, toxicity, mutations and cancer arising from 3MeA in the livers of WT, Aag-/-, and Aag-overexpressing (AagTg) mice. We found that males were more susceptible to NDMA-induced mutations (WT and Aag-/-) and cancer (all genotypes). In contrast, AagTg females were more prone than males to micronucleus induction. As we showed in our prior analyses where data were pooled for males and females, Aag-/- mice were significantly more susceptible to NDMA-induced mutations and cancer, and AagTg mice displayed significantly greater toxicity. Building on these findings, our analyses of sex-related differences show that Aag deficiency and maleness are both susceptibility factors for NDMA-induced liver cancer, while Aag overexpression drives toxicity, potentially with a greater effect on females. By assessing differences between males and females, this study reveals a deeper mechanistic understanding of the underpinnings for a well-known increased risk of liver cancer in men versus women by demonstrating a higher susceptibility of male mice to both mutations and cancer.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Prior research has suggested a potential link between groove and dopamine function; however, no studies to date have directly investigated the relationship between the two. Here, we aimed to assess individual dopamine function in the substantia nigra of healthy individuals using neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI), a non-invasive method associated with dopamine function, and to investigate the relationship between the individual dopamine proxy index and sensitivity to the groove experience. In this study, 15 younger (< 48 years) and 16 older ([greater double equals]48 years) healthy individuals participated. Participants listened to ten musical excerpts and rated the groove experience based on \"pleasure\" and \"wanting to move.\" To assess whether the groove experience is related to NM levels, type of musical excerpts, and sex, we analyzed with linear mixed-effects regression models. The results showed that higher NM levels and males were associated with higher pleasure ratings in the younger group. In the \"urge to move\" ratings, type of musical excerpts was associated with ratings in both groups, with previous research revealing higher ratings for musical excerpts with higher groove ratings (Janata et al., 2012). Taken together, these results suggest that the \"pleasure\" aspect of the groove experience in younger individuals was related to dopamine levels in the SN, but may not be associated with the \"urge to move\". Thus, pleasure and the urge to move are likely to involve distinct dopaminergic pathways and mechanisms, warranting further investigation in this regard.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Using microscopy, roadblocking qPCR, and transcriptomics, we studied mitochondrial transcription in cells subjected to glucose deprivation, which is known to cause nuclear transcription downregulation and to activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). We found that glucose deprivation stabilizes mitochondrial RNAs and slows mitochondrial transcription, effects that are quickly reversed with glucose reintroduction.

We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model that identified a polyadenylation-associated motif as the key hallmark of infection-induced SINEs. Indeed, mRNA polyadenylation machinery is recruited in a Pol III-dependent manner to virus- induced loci, including B2 SINE and tRNA genes. Infection causes enhanced polyadenylation of SINE ncRNA, which is required for its stable accumulation. This virus-host interaction therefore highlights an inducible, coupled relationship between Pol III transcription and mRNA-like polyadenylation.

Like humans, prairie voles are among the few mammalian species that form selective social bonds with both peers and mates, making them an excellent model for the mechanistic investigation of selective social attachment. Here, we explored the role of oxytocin receptors in selective peer attachment using prairie voles lacking a functional oxytocin receptor gene (Oxtr1-/-). We found that Oxtr1-/- animals exhibited significant delays in peer relationship formation compared to wildtype animals. Oxytocin receptor function also contributed to the maintenance of peer bonds, as Oxtr1-/- voles displayed reduced relationship stability and lost selective attachments rapidly in a multi-chamber, group-living habitat. Oxtr1-/- voles also showed deficits in both general social reward as well as selective social reward for a peer partner over an unfamiliar conspecific. Evoked oxytocin release in the nucleus accumbens was reduced in Oxtr1-/- animals compared to their wildtype counterparts, indicating that these voles do not have a compensatory increase in oxytocinergic signaling.

However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect remain unclear. Research demonstrated that oxygen concentration contributes to the FLASH effect, and it has been hypothesized that Fenton reaction might play a role in the ''FLASH effect''. Purpose: We propose to investigate the effect of ultra -high dose rate (UHDR), compared to conventional dose rates (CONV), on the Fenton reaction by studying the radiolysis of Fricke solution. The study will focus on how dose, dose rate, and initial oxygen concentration influence the activation of the Fenton reaction. Methods and Materials: TOPAS-nBio version 2.0 was used to simulate the radiolysis of the Fricke system. A cubic water phantom of 3m side was irradiated by 300MeV protons on one of its edges. For UHDR, a proton field (1.5 x 1.5 m2) was delivered in a single pulse of 1ns width. The protons were accumulated until reached 5Gy or 10Gy absorbed dose. For CONV, the independent history approach was used to mimic 60Co irradiation. For both dose-rates, oxygen concentrations representative of hypoxic and normoxic tissues (10 - 250 M) were simulated. The Gvalue for oxidant ions G(Fe3+) and {Delta}Gvalue of Fenton reaction (H2O2 + Fe2+ [-&gt;] Fe3+ + OH- +OH) were scored. The simulations ended after G(Fe3+) achieved steady state, and calculated yields were compared with published data. Results: For CONV, G(Fe3+) agreed with ICRU-report 34 data by (0.97 {+/-} 0.1) %.

In consequence, UHDR decreased G(Fe3+) by (1.8 {+/-} 0.1)% and (12.5 {+/-} 0.1)% at these oxygen levels.

However, the mechanisms responsible for this effect remain unclear. Research demonstrated that oxygen concentration contributes to the FLASH effect, and it has been hypothesized that Fenton reaction might play a role in the ''FLASH effect''. Purpose: We propose to investigate the effect of ultra -high dose rate (UHDR), compared to conventional dose rates (CONV), on the Fenton reaction by studying the radiolysis of Fricke solution. The study will focus on how dose, dose rate, and initial oxygen concentration influence the activation of the Fenton reaction. Methods and Materials: TOPAS-nBio version 2.0 was used to simulate the radiolysis of the Fricke system. A cubic water phantom of 3m side was irradiated by 300MeV protons on one of its edges. For UHDR, a proton field (1.5 x 1.5 m2) was delivered in a single pulse of 1ns width. The protons were accumulated until reached 5Gy or 10Gy absorbed dose. For CONV, the independent history approach was used to mimic 60Co irradiation. For both dose-rates, oxygen concentrations representative of hypoxic and normoxic tissues (10 - 250 M) were simulated. The Gvalue for oxidant ions G(Fe3+) and {Delta}Gvalue of Fenton reaction (H2O2 + Fe2+ [-&gt;] Fe3+ + OH- +OH) were scored. The simulations ended after G(Fe3+) achieved steady state, and calculated yields were compared with published data. Results: For CONV, G(Fe3+) agreed with ICRU-report 34 data by (0.97 {+/-} 0.1) %.

In this study, we apply a functional high-throughput screening assay, Tope-seq, to detecting cross-reactive epitopes in libraries of >5 x 105 unique peptide-coding sequences. We retrospectively analyze an affinity-enhanced engineered T cell receptor, which previously failed clinical trials due to severe off-target toxicity caused by epitope cross-reactivity, by comprehensive functional testing against all genome-coded self-antigens. Using the Tope-seq methodology, we were able to identify the epitope mediating off-target reactivity at a significance threshold of p < 0.01 in first-pass bulk screening.

While CAR-T cell immunotherapy has demonstrated remarkable success in hematological malignancies, its clinical translation for GBM has been hampered by several fundamental limitations. A key factor among these is tumor-intrinsic heterogeneity, which drives antigen escape and therapeutic resistance. Furthermore, although autologous CAR-T approaches dominate current clinical investigations, they encounter substantial barriers including manufacturing variability, scalability constraints, and practical limitations for widespread clinical deployment. In contrast, allogeneic \"off-the-shelf\" CAR-T therapy holds greater potential for the future applications. {gamma}{delta} T cells are a particularly compelling candidate for universal CAR therapy, offering several advantages including innate MHC-unrestricted target recognition obviating the need for HLA matching, polyfunctional cytotoxic mechanisms capable of addressing heterogeneous tumor populations, and intrinsic tropism for solid tumors. However, translational implementation has been constrained by their physiological rarity, ex vivo expansion difficulties, and genetic modification inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we adopted a dual-pronged targeting strategy focusing on B7-H3 and IL13R2 - two surface antigens demonstrating preferential overexpression across GBM subtypes while maintaining limited distribution in normal tissues. Using phage display platform and function-based nanobody screening, we identified high-affinity binders against both targets. Subsequent optimization of {gamma}{delta} T cell expansion protocols and lentiviral transduction parameters enabled the development of a bispecific, allogeneic CAR-{gamma}{delta} T cell platform. Our in vitro studies revealed that dual-target CAR-{gamma}{delta}T cells sustained proliferative capacity under GMP-compatible culture conditions, exhibited potent and specific cytotoxicity against antigen-positive glioma cells, and critically, they showed superior elimination of target-heterogeneous tumors compared to monospecific CAR-T constructs. These results establish a robust preclinical foundation for clinical translation and highlight the therapeutic potential of combinatorial antigen targeting coupled with allogeneic {gamma}{delta} T cell engineering to overcome the persistent challenges in GBM immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

In contrast, maintaining a stem-like state correlates with better expansion, persistence, and anti-tumor activity of infused T-cell products. IL-2 is extensively used in ACT protocols given its ability to expand T-cell populations. Yet, IL-2 drives more differentiated and exhausted states, diminishing the quality of T-cell products. Understanding how cytokines of the IL2R family drive T-cell differentiation is essential to ultimately design optimal ACT protocols, safeguarding stem-like programs while ensuring sufficient T-cell expansion. Here, we show that cytokine signaling through IL2R{beta} supports more differentiated exhausted T cells in chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis infection. Similarly, high levels of IL-2 and IL-15 in vitro foster heightened differentiation and exhaustion of cells for adoptive cell therapy. In contrast, absence of IL2R{beta}in vivo or transient inhibition of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) or signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in vitro favors features of T-cell stemness. Transcriptional analyses of in vitro expanded T cells further reveal that inhibition of STAT5 sustains a stemness program, which correlates with better antitumor activity in a mouse melanoma model. When applied to a human CAR T expansion model, inhibition of STAT5 supports memory progenitor differentiation and limit inhibitory receptor expression. These results demonstrate that continuous exposure to high levels of cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-15, constrain CD8+ T cells towards more advanced states of exhaustion. In contrast, limiting cytokine signaling using specific kinase inhibitors preserves stem-like T-cell programs and enhance the quality of ACT products.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

However, current methods for assessing phage immunogenicity are limited, hindering the development of safer, more effective therapies. Here, we introduce the Bacteriophage Risk Index (BRI), a novel metric that quantifies phage immunogenic potential based on CpG dinucleotide frequency, motif spacing, and sequence context, key factors influencing Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activation. Applying the BRI to 7,011 phage genomes, we classified them into five risk tiers, revealing substantial immunogenic variability, even among phages targeting the same bacterial host. BRI scores correlated with immune responses in human lung epithelial cells, validating its predictive power. Experimental testing further confirmed this, as exposure of lung epithelial cells to two phages from distinct risk tiers showed that the high-risk phage (Category 4) induced a strong pro-inflammatory response, upregulating CXCL1, CXCL8, IRF7, and TNFAIP3, while the low-risk phage (Category 2) triggered minimal immune activation with limited cytokine expression. These findings confirm that higher BRI scores predict stronger immune responses, providing a robust tool for evaluating phage immunogenicity. By enabling the selection of phages with lower immunogenic potential, the BRI enhances the safety and efficacy of phage therapy while offering a standardized framework for regulatory agencies, clinical researchers, and biologic drug development, with applications extending beyond phage therapy to other immunogenic biologics.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Transferring serum-IgG from FMS patients to mice induced FMS-like symptoms and increased skin mast cells, indicating that FMS-IgG acts through mast cell activation. The ablation of mice Mrgprb2 mast cells or deleting Mrgprb2 receptors prevented IgG-induced heightened sensitivity to mechanical and cold stimuli. Stimulating human LAD2 cells with FMS IgG elicited MRGPRX2-dependent IL-6 production. Consistent with mice findings, mast cell density and tryptase levels increased in human FMS skin samples compared to healthy controls.

M.; Wilson, E. M.; Redick, E.; Youngsteadt, E.; Petry, W. K.", "abstract": "Premise: The defining life history strategy of spring ephemeral wildflowers is their avoidance of shading by trees during the brief, high-light period before canopy leaf-out. Studies suggest that spring ephemerals will experience increased light competition because canopy leaf-out is more sensitive to warming than is the phenology of spring ephemerals. However, it remains unclear how longer durations of shade will alter the population dynamics of spring ephemerals and whether all populations are at risk. Methods: We experimentally shaded Erythronium umbilicatum for one to six additional weeks prior to canopy leaf-out to test for immediate and lagged effects of early shading on the timing of senescence and the probability of survival and flowering. To predict the potential for earlier shading, we combined long-term time series of spring air temperature, remotely-sensed tree leaf-out, and E. umbilicatum flowering phenology in North Carolina, USA. Key results: Early shading did not alter E. umbilicatum until the following year, when more-shaded plants senesced later. We found no change in year-to-year survival, and a reduction in the probability of flowering only when plants experienced extremely early shading. Moreover, E. umbilicatum phenology was more sensitive than tree leaf-out to warming temperatures. Under climate warming, we project that E. umbilicatum is unlikely to experience shortened periods of high light. Conclusions: Our findings show that a plant species' defining life history strategy does not necessarily predict their sensitivity to phenological mismatches. This complicates, but also underscores the importance of identifying the most vulnerable species and directing our research efforts accordingly.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

The poricidal anthers of these flowers release pollen in response to frequency-specific vibrations, which buzz-pollinating bees, including bumble bees and many solitary bees, generate via rapid oscillation of flight muscles. Honeybees are incapable of sonication and typically avoid visiting buzz-pollinated plants, although they have previously been observed to scavenge residual pollen from petals of buzz-pollinated flowers in natural settings. Here, we report a novel interaction in which honeybees consistently visit and extract pollen from flowers of Solanum elaeagnifolium (silverleaf nightshade) within a large invasive plant population in Northern Greece. We postulate that honeybee foraging effort on S. elaeagnifolium reflects the shortage of alternative floral resources at the peak of the Mediterranean summer, consistent with observations for pollen-starved bees in captivity. This newly established behavioral shift of honeybees may convey important implications for plant invasions, particularly under climate change, and requires further investigation for untangling its ultimate drivers.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Phage-bacteria coexistence is often attributed to coevolutionary processes mediated by complex, pairwise infection networks. Here, using in vitro experiments and mathematical models, we explore how higher-order interactions function as a complementary, ecological feedback mechanism to stabilize phage-bacteria communities. To do so, we examine an environmentally-derived, synthetic phage-bacteria community comprised of five marine heterotrophic bacteria (Cellulophaga baltica and Pseudoalteromonas strains) and five associated phage. We used Bayesian inference to reconstruct free phage production in one-step growth experiments and then forecasted pairwise phage-bacteria dynamics over multiple infection cycles. In contrast to model predictions of rapid bacterial population collapse, each bacterial strain persisted, consistent with density-dependent stabilization mechanisms at high virus densities. We then extended models into a community context and found an additional stabilization mechanism: life history traits differ in community vs. pairwise contexts. Follow-up experiments confirm that lysis is inhibited at relatively high viral densities and phage traits (including burst size) can shift when infecting single vs. multiple strains. More broadly, these findings suggest that complex community coexistence of phage and bacteria may be more common than anticipated when including feedback mechanisms outside of regimes of fitted pairwise models that do not reflect the full scope of ecologically relevant contexts.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Transcriptomic profiling of virulent (WT) and an RNAi-deficient strain (r3b2{Delta}) of M. lusitanicus strains during phagocytosis uncovered thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), highlighting early metabolic activation as a key survival strategy inside the phagosome. Enriched pathways included amino acid transport, nucleotide metabolism, and translation, reflecting an adaptive fungal response to nutrient deprivation and host immune stress. Integrative analyses of mRNA and sRNA profiles also revealed a critical role of the RNAi pathways in modulating gene expression during infection.Building on these observations, we identified four chromatin- and transcription-related candidate virulence genes, brca1, box, hist1, and hda10, which were strongly upregulated during phagocytosis and regulated by RNAi. Functional validation through gene deletion in M. lusitanicus and disruption in R. microsporus revealed that while loss of these genes in M. lusitanicus did not significantly affect virulence, R. microsporus mutants for brca1, hist1, and hda10 showed attenuated virulence in a murine model. Our findings suggest that although M. lusitanicus remains a valuable tool for genetic manipulation, species-specific differences must be considered when studying virulence.

Accordingly, HTRA1 has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In fact, genome wide association studies have identified that the 10q26 locus which contains HTRA1 confers the strongest genetic risk factor for AMD. A recent study has suggested that AMD-associated risk alleles in HTRA1 correlate with a significant age-related defect in HTRA1 synthesis in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) within the eye, possibly accounting for AMD susceptibility. Thus, we sought to identify small molecule enhancers of HTRA1 transcription and/or protein abundance using an unbiased high-throughput screening approach. To accomplish this goal, we used CRISPR/Sp.Cas9 engineering to introduce an 11 amino acid luminescent peptide tag (HiBiT) onto the C-terminus of HTRA1 in immortalized ARPE-19 cells. Editing was very efficient (~88%), verified by genomic DNA analysis, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and HiBiT blotting. Nineteen-hundred and twenty compounds from two libraries were screened. An azo compound with reported anti-amyloidogenic and cardioprotective activity, Chicago Sky Blue 6B (CSB), was identified as an enhancer of endogenous HTRA1 secretion (2.0 +/1 0.3 fold) and intracellular levels (1.7 +/- 0.2 fold). These results were counter-screened using HiBiT complement factor H (CFH) edited ARPE-19 cells, verified using HiBiT blotting, and were not due to HTRA1 transcriptional changes. Importantly, serine hydrolase activity-based protein profiling (SH-ABPP) demonstrated that CSB does not affect HTRA1's specific activity. However, interestingly, in follow-up studies, Congo Red, another azo compound structurally similar to CSB, also substantially increased intracellular HTRA1 levels (up to 3.6 +/- 0.3 fold) but was found to significantly impair HTRA1 enzymatic reactivity (0.45 +/- 0.07 fold). Computational modeling of potential azo dye interaction with HTRA1 suggests that CSB and Congo Red can bind to the non-catalytic face of the trimer interface but with different orientation tolerances and interaction energies.

While PACE is highly effective, it is a complex system that poses challenges for implementation4. Despite its high efficiency, ABE8e is associated with limitations such as relatively higher bystander editing effects and elevated off-target activity5, which need to be addressed to further enhance its precision and safety. Here, we developed a novel method for the de novo discovery of evolved ABE components, particularly adenine deaminases. This process involves identifying candidate proteins through AI-based structural prediction and clustering, followed by the enhancement of deaminase editing activity through screening libraries created by sequential amino acid saturation mutagenesis. This evolutionary strategy simplifies the approach by employing saturation mutagenesis libraries tailored to specific segments, thereby enabling exploration of an expanded sequence space and increasing the likelihood of discovering adenine deaminases with superior capabilities. The newly developed hpABE5.20 here demonstrates a more refined editing window, reduced DNA off-target effects that are both sgRNA-dependent and -independent, and minimized RNA off-target activity, while maintaining robust editing efficiency relative to ABE8e. Furthermore, hpABE5.20 has been successfully applied for precise and effective therapeutic adenine base editing in cellular disease models, humanized mice, and non-human primates.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Advancing our understanding and optimization of crop environment interactions is essential for enhancing food production while conserving resources. Mechanistic crop models (MCMs) simulate crop growth by integrating physiological processes such as photosynthesis, biomass allocation, and phenological development. When combined with satellite derived environmental data, these models support large scale assessment of yield potential and water use efficiency, particularly under drought-prone conditions. In this study, we evaluate the CERESRice model to define an ideotype that maximizes grain productivity while optimizing water use. A global sensitivity analysis using the Morris method identifies the most influential genetic based parameters affecting traits such as biomass accumulation, grain yield, tiller number, anthesis timing, and maturity. These parameters were then optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), simulating 1,884 virtual cultivars across 5,692 runs, guided by an integrated Harvest IndexWater Use Efficiency (HI-WUE) metric. The resulting ideotype exhibits favorable traits including optimized phenological timing, and improved grain and water conversion efficiencies across four contrasting environments. To evaluate its genetic feasibility, the optimized parameter profile was compared to 21 field characterized rice cultivars (indica, japonica, and hybrids) using multidimensional similarity metrics, including Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and Cosine distances. This integrative framework demonstrates how combining MCMs with AI based optimization and genotypic comparison can guide ideotype design and accelerate cultivar improvement. The findings highlight actionable physiological traits and genetic targets for breeding climate-resilient, high efficiency rice varieties.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

A.; Kuhl, E.", "abstract": "Computational modeling has become an integral tool for understanding the interaction between structural organization and functional behavior in a wide range of biological tissues, including the human myocardium. Traditional constitutive models, and recent models generated by automated model discovery, are often based on the simplifying assumption of perfectly aligned fiber families. However, experimental evidence suggests that many fibrous tissues exhibit local dispersion, which can significantly influence their mechanical behavior. Here, we integrate the generalized structure tensor (GST) approach into automated material model discovery to represent fibers that are distributed with rotational symmetry around three mean orthogonal directions, fiber, sheet, and normal, by using probabilistic descriptions of the orientation. Using biaxial extension and triaxial shear data from human myocardium, we systematically vary the degree of directional dispersion and stress measurement noise to explore the robustness of the discovered models. Our findings reveal that small dispersion in the fiber direction and arbitrary dispersion in the sheet and normal directions improve the goodness of fit and enable recovery of a previously proposed four-term model in terms of the isotropic second invariant, two dispersed anisotropic invariants and one coupling invariant. Our approach demonstrates strong robustness and consistently identifies similar model terms, even in the presence of up to 7% random noise in the stress data. In summary, our study suggests that automated model discovery based on the powerful generalized structure tensors is robust to noise and captures microstructural uncertainty and heterogeneity in a physiologically meaningful way.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

The mainstream technique of eccDNA detection is using high-throughput sequencing supported by bioinformatics analysis.

To address these limitations, we design ECCFP, a bioinformatic analysis pipeline that detects eccDNAs amplified by rolling circle amplification (RCA) from long-read sequencing data and outputs eccDNA genomic coordinates and consensus sequences. This pipeline proposes a rigorous algorithm to retain all consecutive full passes derived from individual reads to obtain candidate eccDNAs, followed by systematic consolidation of candidate eccDNAs to detect unique eccDNAs. Using simulated datasets and experimental eccDNA sequencing datasets, we estimated ECCFP in several aspects and compared it with other existing pipelines. It exhibits a marked reduction in false positive rates compared with eccDNA_RCA_nanopore and superior sensitivity relative to CReSIL and FLED. Besides, inverse PCR and Sanger sequencing further validated the existence and accuracy of the position of detected eccDNAs by ECCFP.

Here, we integrate public data with in-house clinical samples profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) to compare EO-CRC and LO-CRC. Additionally, we employ gene regulatory network-based protein activity inference (VIPER), enabling a more precise characterization of key regulatory proteins driving tumor-stroma interactions.

However, we identify distinct stromal differences, including a significant enrichment of fibroblasts in EO-CRC. Notably, we define a previously unrecognized epithelial subpopulation in EO-CRC, marked by high expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)--key mediators of inflammation-driven tumor progression and fibroblast recruitment.

We identified PML1 as a key therapeutic entity that can be targeted to overcome resistance. Endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells share three key characteristics: elevated PML1 protein levels, enhanced activity of PI3K, MAPK, or both signaling pathways, and reduced ER activity. We developed a PML1 gene signature that predicts poor prognosis and correlates strongly with PI3K, MAPK, and endocrine resistance gene signatures, as evident by cellular studies, scRNA-seq analysis, and spatial transcriptomics of endocrine therapy-treated tumors. This signature is present in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells harboring the Y537S ER mutation. We consistently demonstrate high PML1 protein levels across cells resistant to various treatments, including 4-hydroxytamoxifen, fulvestrant, elacestrant, and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Furthermore, treatments with these therapeutic agents or knockdown of ESR1 mRNA also increase PML1 protein levels. Mechanistically, we show that ER inhibition through fulvestrant treatment activates PI3K and MAPK signaling, which enhance PML1 protein stability and synthesis. PML1 then drives a feedforward loop by stimulating the expression of cytokine and growth factor mRNAs, including CCL5 and HBEGF, further amplifying PI3K and MAPK signaling. Consequently, in endocrine-resistant cells, endocrine therapies, while inactivating ER, paradoxically reinforce this loop through increased PI3K/MAPK activation and PML1 protein accumulation, ultimately compromising therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we demonstrated that arsenic trioxide, an FDA-approved, PML-reducing drug, effectively disrupts this feedforward loop, offering a promising strategy for treating resistant metastatic breast cancer.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

It is essential to tightly regulate development to prevent unnecessary energy investment into building these structures. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a highly conserved regulator of development in multicellular organisms. In plants, animals, and some fungi, PRC2 tri-methylates histone H3 lysine 27 in promoters and gene bodies to repress gene expression. In Neurospora crassa, H3K27me3-associated genes are poorly conserved and stably repressed in standard lab conditions. Through analysis of publicly available RNA-seq experiments, we found that PRC2-methylated genes are broadly and uniquely activated during sexual development. PRC2-methylated genes comprise a distinct subset of developmentally induced genes (DIGs) characterized by an exceptionally high degree of cell-type specificity. Loss of PRC2 activity results in the precocious formation of perithecia-like structures (dubbed false perithecia), even in the absence of a compatible mating-type partner. These structures show a unique gene expression profile with activation of both PRC2-methylated and unmethylated DIGs, showing evidence of a transcriptional reprogramming event.

We find that pou4-2 is regulated by the SoxB1 homolog, soxB1-2, and is expressed in a distinct population of ciliated sensory cells that detect water flow. Transcriptomic analysis of pou4-2-deficient planarians reveals enrichment for conserved genes associated with human auditory and vestibular function, suggesting that planarian rheosensory neurons share molecular features with mammalian inner ear hair cells.

Here, a proteomic identification of protease cleavage sites (PICS) approach was applied using proteome-derived peptide libraries to determine the enzyme's substrate specificity. PLpro exhibited a yet unreported preference for basic amino acids at P1, primarily arginine or lysine. This secondary specificity frequently involved cleavage between two basic residues (e.g., K|K, K|R or R|K). Experiments with in-house and commercial PLpro in GluC-generated peptide libraries from Escherichia coli and HEK293 proteomes confirmed this preference, though with lower overall efficiency compared to typical trypsin-like proteases. SARS-CoV-1 PLpro likewise displayed this basic-site specificity, underscoring its conservation across related coronaviruses. Site-directed mutagenesis of acidic residues near the catalytic triad to neutral variants altered cleavage preferences, indicating the involvement of these side chains in substrate binding and potential alternative binding modes. We also evaluated wild-type PLpro specificity on intact protein lysates rather than peptide libraries to assess how structure influences cleavage patterns. Notably, P1 arginine specificity persisted at the protein level, whereas lysine specificity was reduced, suggesting additional structural constraints in complex substrates. A strong presence of glycine on the prime side further suggests a bias toward unstructured regions.

In this work, we develop a Chemical Master Equation reference library-based computational pipeline to infer kinetic parameters describing noisy mRNA distributions from single cell RNA sequencing data, using the commonly applied stochastic telegraph model. Our pipeline also serves as a tool for comprehensive analysis of parameter identifiability, in both a priori (studying model properties in the absence of data) and a posteriori (in the context of a particular dataset) use cases. The pipeline can perform both of these tasks, i.e. inference and identifiability analysis, in an efficient and scalable manner, and also serves to disentangle contributions to uncertainty in inferred parameters from experimental noise versus structural properties of the model. We found that for the telegraph model, the majority of the parameter space is not practically identifiable from single cell RNA sequencing data, and low experimental capture rates worsen the identifiability.

It is present in all green plants, with very different concentrations in different plant species. While ascorbate accumulation is a trait of nutritional, and therefore, agronomical interest, the impact of different concentrations over cellular homeostasis remains elusive. In order to shed light over this question, we leveraged Arabidopsis lines with very low ascorbate (vtc2 mutant with 20% of WT ascorbate levels), and low ascorbate concentration (vtc4 mutant with 65% of WT levels), and we generated a line that accumulates 165% of WT levels (vtc2/OE-VTC2). An 80% reduction of ascorbate increased the expression of genes implicated in defense against pathogens, but repressed genes associated with abiotic stress responses. Unexpectedly, lines with increased (165% of WT) and decreased (65% of WT) ascorbate levels shared 85% of induced transcription factors and the GO terms associated with their transcriptional programs. Among the group of genes whose expression is positively correlated with ascorbate content, we identified TAA1/WEI8, a gene encoding a tryptophan aminotransferase that catalyzes the first step of auxin biosynthesis. Using a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches in fluorescent and histochemical reporter lines for auxin biosynthesis and signaling activity, we revealed that TAA1- and TAA1-RELATED2 (TAR2)-mediated auxin biosynthesis is necessary for plants to cope with increased ascorbate concentration in a light-dependent manner, revealing a new layer of complexity in the regulatory landscape of redox homeostasis.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we utilized high-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) via the Xenium platform with a fully customized gene panel to elucidate disease-associated microglial subtypes in tandem with examining metabolic signatures across AD-relevant mouse models and well-characterized human postmortem tissue. Three mouse models were evaluated: PS19, APP/PS1, and 5xFAD. Analyzing anatomical features across entire hemisections, our approach resolved the distribution of five disease-associated microglial subtypes, while deciphering how proximity to cerebral amyloid plaques influenced transcriptional mediators governing metabolic pathways. We observed robust alterations in glycolytic and cholesterol/lipid processing pathways in plaque-associated microglia, consistent with a specific switch to glycolysis and lipid-fueled metabolism in the plaque niche. Extending our analysis to human postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), we identified conserved disease-reactive microglial states, i.e., similar proximity-dependent metabolic shifts around amyloid plaques. Further, integrating spatial transcriptomics with machine-learning approaches revealed novel anatomic domain-specific cellular gene expression profiling features, highlighting differential vulnerabilities of neuronal populations near specific microglial subtypes.

Using an attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus TC83 (referred to as TC83) to inoculate using olfactory and intracranial injections, we show that infection in the CNS and olfactory pathways results in rapid infiltration of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells as early as 3- and 5-days post-infection.

Therefore, we examined I. ricinus tick density and Borrelia spp. prevalence in relation to a comprehensive set of habitat and host-related variables. Ticks were collected using the flagging method and mammal hosts were monitored using an innovative camera-trapping approach across 25 forest plots along a land-use gradient within the Schwabische Alb exploratory in Germany.

We show that, paradoxically, the opposite pattern prevails, countries with highest poverty reside in the world's most biodiverse regions but the most financially prosperous countries reside in low biodiversity regions. We quantitatively resolve this paradox, by modelling biodiversity influences on poverty through historical pathways of colonialism that led to export economies with weak governance and increased poverty rates. This finding supports the proposed \"systemic bio-inequity\" hypothesis. In attempting to solve poverty through conservation, a second paradox emerges: conservation investments align neither with the economic capacity to protect nature nor with the global distribution of biodiversity.

This method provides a complete view of TL distributions and enables broad exploration of TL diversity, as it is directly applicable to any high-throughput single-molecule sequencing dataset without prior DNA preparation. We analyzed the TL distribution in 100 S. cerevisiae strains representing the genetic and ecological diversity of the species. We obtained the first species-level view of TL distributions at individual chromosome extremities and measured their mean value across all strains at 359 {+/-} 129 bp. Our analysis revealed a large diversity in TL distributions across strains, polyploids exhibiting longer telomeres than diploids and haploids. We confirmed that TL distributions are specific to each chromosome extremity and found that the extent of the inter-extremity differences within a strain varied widely across strains. Each strain displays a distinct TL distribution pattern defined by two components: inter-extremity differences in mean TL and within-extremity TL heterogeneity. Differences in inter-extremity mean TL accounted for most of the observed TL variations between strains. Furthermore, we found that inter-extremity differences partly result from the presence of subtelomeric Y' elements, which are associated with longer telomeres in cis. Interestingly, despite large TL variations, the length of the shortest telomeres remained relatively constant across strains and fluctuated around 138 {+/-} 45 bp, suggesting a selective constraint at the species level.

Increasingly, tissue engineering scaffolds are being developed and translated to promote their healing. To control signaling in the wound environment, gene therapy approaches are being explored, with adeno-associated virus (AAV) becoming increasingly popular. One critical challenge in chronic wound healing is that the wounds do not progress through the typical wound healing cascade, with signaling getting stuck in the inflammatory/immature tissue formation phase. This motivated us to develop a system capable of triggered sequential release of viral vectors to drive coordinated signaling. By housing this system within a collagen-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) scaffold, we aim to provide a proven extracellular matrix template as well as the correct signaling profile for closure of chronic wounds. Our system consists of two alginate pockets within the collagen-GAG scaffold, which we use to control the release of AAV. The first pocket allows diffusion of one AAV therapeutic and the second pocket can be ultrasound-triggered using low-frequency stimulation to release the second therapeutic. Initially, we developed and characterized the system using a reporter AAV. At our high AAV loading, we got sustained release and GFP expression in HEK293T cells over 9 days from our system in vitro, but lower loading had minimal transduction. When this lower group was triggered with ultrasound, cells were successfully transduced. Finally, we demonstrated sequential release of AAV encoding clinically-relevant genes for angiogenesis.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying the sustained downstream pathway activation induced by these mutations remain unclear. To investigate this, we employed molecular dynamics simulations and computational biophysical approaches to examine how VF mutations sustain JAK-STAT pathway activation. Our analyses, encompassing energetics, interaction forces, and surface electrostatic charge distributions, revealed that these mutations predominantly alter the spatial conformations and stability of the proteins by modulating inter-dimeric interaction forces and binding free energies. Specifically, the V617F mutation in JAK2 enhanced the stability of the JAK2 dimer and suppressed the activity of the JH2 pseudokinase domain. Similarly, the V678F mutation in TYK2 reducing the binding strength of the JH1 kinase domain and the binding free energy, increasing the binding affinity at the dimer interface. Both mutations ultimately resulted in heightened JH1 kinase domain activity and aberrant activation of downstream signaling pathways. Electrostatic analyses further demonstrated that JAK2V617F strengthened attractive forces within the dimer and TYK2V678F mutation mitigated repulsive forces. Decreased binding free energy confirmed enhanced dimer stability in JAK2V617F and TYK2V678F mutants, driven by distinct mechanisms: reinforced JH2 domain interactions in JAK2V617F and domain compaction with reoriented interfaces in TYK2V678F. These insights delineate the mutation-specific allosteric networks that underpin the pathogenesis of thrombocythemia.

Among these, the core protein (HCC) forms the capsid via organised multimerization, thereby guiding viral assembly. This process depends on the dynamic localisation of HCC between the endoplasmic reticulum bilayer membrane and the lipid droplet monolayer. While past studies have examined the role of some HCC structural properties and other viral and host proteins in the assembly process, the contribution of lipid molecules was not thoroughly investigated yet. Since specific lipids are upregulated during HCV infection, it is reasonable that these molecules might play an important role for virus fitness and infection progression. In this study, we have addressed this topic and, specifically, how HCC-lipid interactions might impact HCC-HCC interactions. Using in vitro models and quantitative fluorescence microscopy techniques, we investigated HCC binding affinity to lipid membranes, multimerization and lateral diffusivity. Our results reveal the specificity of HCC interactions with anionic phospholipids (PLs) in terms of binding to monolayers and bilayers. Furthermore, our analysis shows that anionic PLs enhance HCC multimerization and, therefore, might drive lateral assembly for capsid formation.

Here, we present an unsupervised framework combining dynamic time warping (DTW) clustering with phase-space and fatigue-sensitive descriptors to uncover latent motility phenotypes. Methods: We analyzed 1176 sperm tracks from the VISEM dataset using DTW distance matrices applied to velocity time series, followed by agglomerative hierarchical clustering (n = 2). After cluster assignment, we extracted phase-space features: recurrence rate, spectral entropy, fractal index, and Lyapunov approximation. Fatigue metrics such as VSL slope were also computed. Results: DTW clustering revealed two well-separated motility phenotypes with a mean silhouette score of 0.861. Chaotic-like tracks exhibited higher spectral entropy (4.45 vs 2.58), elevated fractal index (0.079 vs 0.434), and increased local instability as reflected by the Lyapunov approximation (0.131 vs 0.009; all p < 0.001). Recurrence rate showed no significant difference. VSL slope was markedly more negative in Chaotic-like tracks, indicating a stronger fatigue component.

By mapping residue-level free energy contributions across experimentally resolved assembly pathways, we reconstruct the complex maturation trajectories of distinct amyloid systems. We find that amyloid assembly is driven by aggregation-prone regions that act as sequence-encoded stabilizing motifs. As assembly progresses, these motifs are reorganized and expanded, while additional regions introduce structural frustration that enables conformational flexibility. In several cases, environmental cofactors such as metal ions or polyanions are observed in association with regions of structural remodeling, where they may act to compensate for otherwise energetically strained conformations. Notably, structurally distinct polymorphs can exhibit similar energetic profiles, while polymorphs with similar folds may differ thermodynamically depending on their assembly environment. This framework connects polymorph structure to both encoded sequence features and extrinsic modifiers, offering mechanistic insight into how amyloid strains mature and diversify over time.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Moreover, MVI expression depends on a muscle type, with the highest levels in the slow-twitch soleus muscle (SOL) of adult animals. Remarkably, the effects of MVI loss are most pronounced in this muscle type, characterized by the highest number of mitochondria compared to fast-twitch muscles. Loss of MVI resulted in a significant reduction of the respiratory capacity of myogenic cells, accompanied by a decrease in the overall ATP production, confirming a compromised mitochondrial function. Interestingly, analysis of the myofiber types revealed that lack of MVI triggers glycolytic-to-oxidative fiber-type switch, which was more pronounced in SOL. Furthermore, we also observed an increased level of phospho-AMPK in MVI-KO SOL in all studied timepoints as well as downregulation of the mTOR pathway and upregulation of key proteins involved in lipolysis. These findings point at MVI as a new regulator of metabolic processes in skeletal muscle.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

These activations trigger the signaling pathways involved in antiviral responses. Activated pathways play a crucial role in the regulation of inflammatory and antiviral responses involving transcription factors, cytokines, cell surface viral sensors, and the activation of target genes. Although the role of key transcription factors such as NFkB and IRF-3 in the regulation of antiviral genes that encode type I interferons (IFNalpha/beta) is identified and well explored. The precise mechanistic understanding that governs their complex context-dependent temporal activation remains elusive. Here, we have developed a mathematical model to demonstrate the co-regulation of the expression of the IFN$\\beta$ gene by Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFkB) and IFN Regulatory Factor-3 (IRF-3) after their activation in host cells by the viral analogue Poly I:C. In our model, the binding activities of the transcription factors NFkB and IRF-3 at the IFNbeta promoter are modeled using a probability-based framework. Our results demonstrate that the expression pattern of IFNbeta post-viral infections would be pertaining to the co-activation of that by NFkB and IRF-3. In addition, the immediate expression of the IFN$\\beta$ gene and, thus, the initial host response would be mainly attributed to immediate activation of NFkB while IRF-3 would be responsible for delayed but persistent expression of the IFNbeta. Our model provides an underlying molecular mechanism for a similar response observed for Newcastle disease virus and the Vesicular stomatitis virus infection. Furthermore, we suggest that the rapid as well as an elevated and persistent expression of IFNbeta, would be observed later due to a temporal bias in binding of both transcription factors NFkB and IRF-3, highlighting the need for coregulation of IFNbeta by two different signaling pathways in a sequential manner. Also, our model predicts that the binding affinity of IRF3 to the promoter region of IFNbeta would be equal to or larger than that of NFkB for a strong and persistent antiviral responses.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

In this study, we assessed how chromatin remodeling induced by broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors affects cellular differentiation trajectories in rat primary neuron-glia cultures using a combination of transcriptomics, qPCR and cytochemistry. We described epigenetic regulation of transcriptional programs controlled by master transcription factors and neurotrophins in the context of neuronal and glial differentiation and evaluated the expression of representative cell-specific markers. The results obtained suggest that HDAC inhibitors reduce proliferative potential of cultured cells and induce transcriptomic changes associated with cell differentiation and specialization. Particularly, we revealed a significant upregulation of genes typically expressed in neuromodulatory neurons, and downregulation of genes expressed in glia and inhibitory neurons. Transcriptional changes were accompanied by continuous elevation of histone serotonylation levels in both neurons and glia. We assume that early appearance of the enhanced histone serotonylation marks, and the persistence of these changes over many hours in distinct brain cells may indicate that chromatin remodeling induced by histone serotonylation contributes to the maintainance of a new transcriptional programs associated with cellular reprogramming.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

This study explored how the source of the EVs influenced their characteristics and the effect these differences had on naive brain tissue. EVs were isolated from animals post-stroke in the acute or chronic stages of recovery in animals with and without reperfusion, and from a model of systemic inflammation (intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide). The data show that neither stroke nor inflammation significantly increase EV numbers compared to sham or naive animals. Post-stroke EVs exhibited a panel of different platelet and inflammatory markers, when compared to EVs derived from a model of inflammation, reflecting differences between stroke and systemic immune activation. When injected into the brain, both stroke-derived and inflammation-derived EVs induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression, suggesting a potential role in neuroinflammation. However, there was a lack of distinct glial and astrocyte reactivity in response to any EVs, despite robust changes in ICAM reactivity. The findings here underscore the complexity of EV roles in pathophysiology and highlight the need for improved EV isolation methods. With further longitudinal studies we may be able to more accurately determine how the context of the injury (reperfusion vs no reperfusion vs inflammation) might contribute to the EV populations and their function. Understanding more about EVs in different contexts will improve our ability to use EVs as biomarkers, but also our capacity to interfere with EV biology as a novel therapeutic approach.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

In a population-based sample of over 500 subjects, we hypothesized: (i) that there are structural associations between circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and brain grey matter density and white matter microstructural properties in visual information processing areas, and specifically contralateral associations for nasal retinal fibers, and (ii) that retinal findings reflect broader changes in brain grey and white matter related to cardiovascular risk factors. In support of the first hypothesis, we showed associations of circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness with visual cortex grey matter density and with optic radiation fractional anisotropy. These correlations were stronger for the right eye, possibly reflecting right ocular dominancy. Regarding the second hypothesis, while we confirmed the broad impact of cardiovascular risk factors such as body mass index, diabetes, and hypertension on brain structure, we didn't find (adequate) significant partial correlations between circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and cardiovascular risk factors to support the hypothesis. As such, we couldn't confirm that circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness is associated with the impact of cardiovascular risk factors on the brain structure. However, when the effects of cardiovascular risk factors were accounted for statistically, circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (particularly on the right side) was associated with fractional anisotropy of limbic system tracts, i.e., the fornix and stria terminalis including hippocampus and amygdala. To further explore the structural associations between eye and brain, in terms of a possible common underlying pathology related to cardiovascular risk factors and progressive neurodegenerative diseases on the central nervous system, longitudinal and interventional studies are necessary.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Prior studies demonstrated that genital tract secretions exhibit variable neutralizing activity against HSV, independent of serostatus, but the relationship of this activity to the vaginal microbiome and underlying mechanisms have not been defined. To test the hypothesis that cervicovaginal antiviral activity is lower in women with BV, we took advantage of cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) available from two studies conducted among women with symptomatic BV and healthy controls. CVL obtained from women with BV had significantly less antiviral activity than controls (p< 0.001). Inhibitory activity correlated negatively and most strongly with Shannon diversity index (p<0.0001). The innate activity did not differ comparing HSV-seropositive versus seronegative participants and no HSV-specific antibodies were detected in CVL. Activity was enriched in the immunoglobulin fraction but was lost when IgG (but not IgA) was depleted. Increasing doses of an anti-glycoprotein E (gE) monoclonal antibody overcame the neutralizing activity, suggesting that interactions between the Fc region of IgG and gE, a viral Fc gamma receptor (FcgR), contribute. Consistent with this notion, CVL had less HSV inhibitory activity against a gE-null virus. Glycan analysis demonstrated a decrease in mature glycans in IgG from CVL with low antiviral activity and treatment of CVL with peptide N-glycanase F, which cleaves N-glycans in IgG, resulted in a loss of HSV inhibitory activity. We speculate that glycosidases elaborated by anaerobic bacteria cleave Fc glycans, resulting in decreased affinity for gE and a reduction in protective activity.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) is one such species, shaping its habitat by felling trees, building dams and creating wetlands. However, while the potential benefits to aquatic biodiversity and ecological functioning have been studied on a local scale, the impacts of beavers on catchment-scale processes such as fish migration remain understudied. 2. Sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) from water samples is a cost-effective method to study species distributions across large geographical scales. Here, eDNA samples (n=426) were collected from 142 sites across the UKs oldest and largest established wild beaver population, located on Tayside, East Scotland, and analysed using a vertebrate specific metabarcoding assay. We combined presence/absence data from eDNA results with other environmental and anthropogenic variables to model the effects of beaver presence on the distribution of three migratory fish species. 3. Using generalised linear models, we found no effects of the current beaver presence on the distribution of Atlantic salmon or lamprey, but a positive co-occurrence with European eel at the catchment scale. Model outputs also reinforced previous findings on the impact of barriers to migration and other abiotic and biotic factors on fish species, demonstrating the effectiveness of eDNA sampling in rivers for understanding species distributions at a catchment scale. 4. This case study provides novel insights into the co-distribution of beavers and migratory fish, and highlights how catchment-wide eDNA monitoring can be applied by environmental managers to aid decision-making and impact assessment more generally.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

This was the first systematic assessment of lightning-caused disturbance in Africa and a preliminary test of the hypothesis that forest tolerance to lightning is higher where lightning disturbances are more common. Lightning-caused disturbances were observed six-times more frequently on ridges than in valleys, but lightning-caused disturbances in valleys tended to cause more tree-level damage than those on ridges. Overall, lightning disturbances tended to kill a lower proportion of trees in this Afromontane forest than in previously documented lightning disturbances in tropical America. We also observed less tree-level damage to Syzygium spp.(Myrtaceae) compared to the community-wide average, providing support for taxonomic differences in lightning tolerance.

Ethylene triggers these growth responses within two hours; however, the protein machineries and cellular processes that mediate morphogenesis control are not known. Here, we used quantitative proteomics and co-fractionation mass spectrometry to test for rapid ethylene-dependent changes in protein abundance and protein complex composition. Protein multimerization responses were numerous and diverse. There were instances of protein complex assembly and disassembly, with varying degrees of completeness.

Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) represents another mechanism by which functional connectivity is achieved, and to date, the role played by PAC in understanding the development of AUD has yet to be investigated. In the current study, we compare PAC strengths between participants with severe AUD, defined as presenting with 6 or more symptoms (DSM-5), and unaffected controls. Associations between phase-amplitude coupling and AUD status were assessed using frontal EEG signals acquired during the resting state eyes closed condition as part of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). COGA is a national project following families affected with AUD and comparison families for over 35 years with data collection in multiple domains. COGA participants between 25 and 50 years old with severe AUD were compared to an age-matched group of unaffected controls (Women: N = 360; Men: N = 406). PAC calculations were made on EEG recordings from midfrontal channel FZ to generate high resolution comodulograms covering phase frequencies between 0.1-13 Hz and amplitude frequencies between 4-50 Hz. Comodulograms were generated for each 30 second EEG segment for a given visit. Average comodulogram for a visit was calculated for the first two minutes of EEG in the resting state condition for subsequent statistical analyses. PAC differences between AUD and unaffected controls were assessed at each frequency pair using Mann-Whitney test, and the resulting effect sizes and p-values were used to generate difference comodulograms and significance comodulograms, respectively. Results showed that severe AUD was associated with greater alpha-gamma PAC in both men and women compared to the unaffected groups. Men with AUD exhibited significant increases in PAC across large parts of theta-gamma. In women with AUD, increases in theta-gamma PAC were restricted to smaller domains, and accompanied significant decreases in neighboring theta-gamma subdomains. PAC strength in theta-alpha and alpha-beta frequency pair domains were also significantly greater in AUD for both men and women. The AUD-associated changes in PAC strength within the alpha-gamma, theta-beta, alpha-beta, and to a lesser degree in theta-gamma domains indicates some form of aberrant hyperconnectivity between networks within the medial prefrontal cortex during resting state of the brain.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

We combined these layer-specific fMRI responses with electroencephalography (EEG) responses for the same images to segregate feedforward and feedback signals in both time and space. Feedforward signals emerge early in the middle layers of EVC and LOC, followed by feedback signals in the superficial layer of both regions, and the deep layer of EVC.

However, the molecular mechanisms that function in oocytes to mediate this intergenerational stress response are similarly unknown. Here, we developed a low input oocyte proteomics workflow and combined it with our C. elegans intergenerational stress response model to find that both maternal environment and maternal insulin signaling regulate the abundance of ETC proteins in oocytes, particularly the abundance of proteins involved in the transfer of electrons from QH2 to cytochrome C by ETC Complex III. Using genetic perturbations of ETC function we further found that promoting ETC Complex III function in oocytes was both necessary and sufficient to link maternal environment to adaptive changes in offspring metabolism. Lastly, we found that the effects of Complex III dysfunction in oocytes on offspring were mediated via an AMP kinase (AAK-2) dependent mechanism and that AAK-2 functions in offspring to promote ATP preservation and glycerol metabolism in response to stress.

Despite their known cellular, mitochondrial, and neurotoxic effects, the mechanisms underlying their toxicity remain poorly understood. Using a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening approach, we identified CERS2, ELOVL1, ACACA, HSD17B12, and PTPLB as key mediators of 1-deoxySL-induced toxicity. All genes are integral to the biosynthesis of very long-chain (VLC) fatty acids and VLC-ceramides. We validated these findings through genetic knockdown experiments, cytotoxicity assays, and stable isotope-resolved lipidomics via LC-MS/MS. Pharmacological inhibition of ELOVL1 using a preclinical tested compound alleviated the cellular, mitochondrial, and neuronal toxicity induced by 1-deoxySLs. Supplementation experiments combining 1-deoxySLs with various VLC fatty acids revealed that 1-deoxyDHceramide conjugated to nervonic acid (m18:0/24:1) is the principal toxic specie. Further mechanistic studies showed that m18:0/24:1 induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) formation. Inhibition of BAX or blocking mPTP formation with cyclosporin A effectively prevented toxicity. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that 1-deoxyDHCeramides conjugated to nervonic acid are the primary mediators of 1-deoxySL toxicity, acting through mitochondrial dysfunction and BAX-dependent apoptosis.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Objectives: Determine the role of cellular senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in mediating Doxo-induced aortic stiffening and the influence of senolytic therapy. Methods: Aortic stiffness (aortic pulse-wave velocity [PWV]), and associated mechanisms were assessed in young adult p16-3MR mice, a model that allows for genetic-based clearance of senescent cells with ganciclovir [GCV]. Young (4-6 month) mice were injected with Doxo and subsequently treated with GCV or the senolytic ABT263. We evaluated the influence of SASP-associated circulating factors in plasma (the circulating SASP milieu) in mediating aortic stiffening ex vivo (aortic elastic modulus) and examined the contribution of glycation stress. Results: Doxo increased aortic PWV (425 vs. control, 353 cm/sec; P<0.05), an effect prevented by both GCV (348 cm/sec) and ABT263 (342 cm/sec; P<0.05 for both vs. Doxo). Plasma from Doxo-treated mice induced aortic stiffening ex vivo (P<0.05 vs. plasma from control mice), whereas plasma from Doxo-GCV and Doxo-ABT263 groups did not. Glycation stress was implicated in SASP-mediated aortic stiffening with Doxo, as inhibition of receptor mediated glycation stress signaling attenuated plasma-induced aortic stiffening.

J.; Ill, C. R.; Spencer, S. L.", "abstract": "Resistance to targeted therapy in BRAF-mutant melanomas can arise from drug-tolerant persister cells, which can non-genetically escape drug-induced quiescence to resume proliferation. To investigate how melanoma cells adapt to re-enter the cell cycle within 3-4 days of BRAF and MEK inhibition, we computationally reconstructed single-cell lineages from time-lapse imaging data, linking key signaling pathways to cell-cycle fate outcomes. We found that ERK reactivation, while necessary, is insufficient for cell-cycle re-entry in the presence of drug. Instead, mTORC1 emerged as an additional critical mediator, enhancing translation and cell growth in persisters destined for drug escape. We further found that ERK and mTORC1 signaling converge to produce Cyclin D1 protein levels, a key bottleneck for cell-cycle re-entry. Using CRISPR to tag endogenous Cyclin D1, we found that future escapees markedly upregulate Cyclin D1 at least 15 hours prior to drug escape, compared to non-escapees. Importantly, this early upregulation enables accurate prediction of future escapees from non-escapees, underscoring how differences in Cyclin D1 accumulation precede and govern the timing and likelihood of cell-cycle re-entry in persister cells. Our findings suggest that variability in ERK and mTORC1 activity underlies the heterogeneous Cyclin D1 levels observed, influencing the proliferative potential of persister cells and ultimately shaping the diverse cell-cycle behaviors observed under drug treatment. Cyclin D1 protein therefore emerges as both a critical biomarker and a therapeutic target for preventing cell-cycle re-entry in BRAF/MEK-treated melanoma.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

These fibroblasts contribute to the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier under physiological conditions, participate in fibrosis, and support blood brain barrier integrity during injury and disease. However, their Ca2+ signaling profiles and underlying mechanisms in health and disease remain poorly understood. In this study, we divided leptomeningeal fibroblasts into three subgroups based on their locations: arachnoid fibroblasts, pia mater fibroblasts and perivascular fibroblasts. We employed two-photon microscopy in awake transgenic mice expressing Ca2+; indicators in leptomeningeal fibroblasts to investigate spontaneous and behaviorally evoked Ca2+; transients across different fibroblast subgroups. We found that each subgroup exhibits a distinct Ca2+; activity profile, with pia mater fibroblasts showing the highest-amplitude Ca2+; transients. Moreover, these fibroblasts displayed unique responses to both whisker air-puff stimulation and locomotion. We further demonstrated, using a chronically implanted cannula beneath the cranial window, that locomotion-associated vasodilation is followed by TRPV4 channel-mediated fibroblast Ca2+; elevations. Finally, systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) reduced spontaneous Ca2+; transients in pia mater fibroblasts, likely due to macrophage infiltration following the inflammatory response. For the first time, this study characterizes spontaneous and behaviorally evoked Ca2+; dynamics in distinct leptomeningeal fibroblast subgroups in awake animals, providing novel insights into the functional roles of leptomeningeal fibroblasts in the healthy and diseased brain.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

One element of the SVA is a tandem polymorphic CCCTCT repeat tract whose length inversely correlates with the age of disease onset. Previous observations that the repeat exhibits length-dependent somatic expansion and that XDP onset is modified by variation in DNA repair gene MSH3 indicated that somatic repeat expansion is an important disease driver. Here, we sought to uncover genetic modifiers of CCCTCT instability in XDP patients and to provide a mechanistic link between somatic instability and disease. We determined quantitative metrics of both repeat expansion and repeat contraction in blood. Using genetic association analyses of exome sequencing data, as well as directed sequencing of a variant MSH3 repeat, we found that MSH3 modifies repeat expansion and contraction in blood as well as age at onset. MSH3 alleles associated with earlier disease onset were associated with more expansion and less contraction. Conversely, alleles associated with later disease onset were associated with less expansion and more contraction. Notably, MSH3 repeat alleles were also similarly associated with expansion and contraction in brain tissues. Our findings provide key evidence that MSH3 role(s) in CCCTCT repeat dynamics underlies its impact on clinical disease and indicate that therapeutic strategies to lower or inhibit MSH3 are predicted to both slow CCCTCT expansion and promote CCCTCT contraction, impacting the disease course prior to clinical onset.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

We chromosomally integrated a tunable dCas9 gene and designed module-specific gRNAs, with each module encoding its own gRNA to self-repress via competition for limited dCas9. This configuration introduces strong negative feedback to the more active module while reallocating resources to the less active one, promoting balanced module activation. Compared to the control group lacking dCas9-mediated repression, the NCR controller significantly increased module coactivation and suppressed WTA behavior. Our quantitative results demonstrate that NCR provides an effective strategy for regulating resource competition and improving the modularity of synthetic gene circuits.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Currently, little is understood about bleaching at the molecular level, since changes in metabolic and redox interactions between the dinoflagellate algae and Cnidaria are challenging to study. Here, we developed electrochemical approaches to measure extracellular electron transfer (EET, a type of bioelectricity) in Symbiodinium microadriaticum, a model species of symbiont-forming dinoflagellate algae, and show how this can be used to assess intracellular bioenergetic fluctuations within the alga. We show that EET is dependent on two major intracellular pathways -- photosynthesis and respiration -- and reveal that expelled electrons exit the cell via diffusible electron carriers. We confirm that EET activity can be affected by environmental stressors linked to coral bleaching, such as changes in temperature, pH and light intensity.

We now understand that NSV can originate from expanded cell clones harboring genetically identical proviruses that reactivate en masse to produce clinically detectable viremia. NSV can even originate from proviruses with genomic defects, particularly in HIV's major splice donor (MSD) site, that render the viremia non-infectious. But, because only a limited number of such cases have been described, all in HIV subtype B, the mechanisms that allow cells harboring such proviruses to produce prolonged viremia without being eliminated remain incompletely understood. We characterized a case of MSD-defective, replication-impaired NSV that lasted >4 years in an individual with non-B HIV. Our results reveal that proviruses with MSD deletions can persist by integrating into minimally differentiated CD4+ T-cell subsets that then give rise to the full spectrum of memory and effector subpopulations, and by exhibiting an HIV protein expression profile that would allow these cells to evade cellular and humoral immunity.

Moreover, the ECM cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2) was increased in omental metastases, where it is enzymatically active in the extracellular environment. This information was used to develop ECM constructs recapitulating these key changes, alone and in combination, to investigate their impact on HGSOC cell adhesion. To our knowledge, this is the first report using TG2 as a cross-linking agent to generate constructs from multiple ECM components. Low levels of HGSOC cell adhesion were observed on colIagen-only (coll) gels, while inclusion of cFN or plasma fibronection (pFN) increased cell adhesion. TG2-mediated cross-linking of colI/cFN hydrogels promoted HGSOC cell adhesion, while cross-linking of coll/pFN had no effect. Cell adhesion was dependent on ligand identity and fiber diameter. When fiber thickness was held constant, the inclusion of cFN led to greater HGSOC cell adhesion relative to pFN or coll, due to interactions of {beta}1 integrins with the EDA and RGD domains of cFN. Meanwhile, when gel composition was held constant, HGSOC cell adhesion increased as fiber thickness was increased through modifications to gelation temperature.

MD analysis revealed three known compounds (Rosuvastatin, CID: 54365126 and 7304563) as potential competitive GIRK2 modulators, exhibiting stable interactions with residues critical for binding endogenous activators (PIP2, cholesterol), and GIRK-acting drugs. Docking analyses also revealed strong binding to GIRK2 for various metabolites, including leukotrienes, resolvins, acyl-CoAs, and polyphosphates, including adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) and thiamine-triphosphate. Notably, some of the identified compounds can affect similar ion channels, indicating potential cross-reactivity with GIRK2. Furthermore, the binding modes of acyl-CoAs and polyphosphates closely resemble PIP2 s hydrophobic and phosphate group engagement. Together, these findings offer promising candidates for experimental validation and therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) compete to repair DNA double strand breaks. Given that NHEJ factors such as Ku and DNA-PKcs are rapidly recruited to DSBs and sterically occlude ends, they must be removed to enable 5' DNA end resection, the commitment step of HR. While resection is well characterized, how the NHEJ machinery is displaced from DNA ends has remained poorly understood. Here, we performed single-molecule imaging in Xenopus laevis egg extracts to monitor the removal of NHEJ factors from DNA ends while simultaneously tracking the progress of DNA end resection. We find that MRN and CtIP are essential to evict the core NHEJ factor Ku from DNA ends. Surprisingly, while Ku removal and resection of the 5' end are normally coordinated, these processes arise from distinct activities of the MRN complex and are differentially regulated by the action of cyclin dependent kinases and ATM. By directly imaging the position of Ku on DNA using smFRET, we found that Ku is translocated independently of DNA end resection in an ATP-dependent manner that requires both MRN and CtIP. In summary, our results provide a new mechanistic framework to understand how eviction of the NHEJ machinery is coordinated with DNA resection to initiate HR.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

While the discovered vulnerability has been mitigated, its true severity remains unclear, as the study was performed without experimental testing of the synthetic homologs. Here, we present a testing, evaluation, validation, and verification (TEVV) framework for AI-assisted protein design (AIPD), using safe proteins as SOC proxies. Our findings indicate AIPD can generate synthetic homologs whose predicted structures are similar to a native template, but without necessarily retaining activity. We determine that current AIPD systems are not yet powerful enough to reliably rewrite the sequence of a given protein, while both maintaining activity and evading detection by BSS. We further conclude that TEVV of generated sequences requires significant investment of time, technical skill, and resources.

Here, we describe a cell microfactory platform based on the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii for the production of nanobody biologics in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. High-level secretion of nanobodies by S. boulardii was achieved by optimizing promoters, secretion signals, and antibody formats.

Their rapid evolution often obscures evolutionary relationships, making it difficult to assign functions using sequence-based methods alone. Although conservation of protein fold can reveal deep homologies undetectable by sequence comparison, viral proteins remain vastly underrepresented in structural databases, limiting our ability to explore them at the structural level. Here, we address this gap by clustering all unique viral sequences from the NCBI RefSeq database and predicting the structures of ~27,000 representative proteins using AlphaFold2, creating a large-scale viral structural resource, the Viral AlphaFold Database (VAD). We uncover ~10,000 proteins belonging to clusters that share folds across viruses infecting bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, revealing shared protein folds across diverse host-infecting viruses. We also predict oligomeric states using AlphaFold2-based homodimer modelling, alongside structural comparisons to the Protein Data Bank, providing valuable new data on the potential for viral proteins to oligomerise. We further reveal that large regions of the viral protein universe remain functionally dark and report the discovery and experimental validation of a previously uncharacterised antiviral toxin-antitoxin (TA) system.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are crucial post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, fine tuning protein levels to maintain cellular homeostasis. In C. elegans, a 5-day swimming regimen increased mitochondrial content, lifespan and fitness. Small RNA sequencing identified exercise specific miRs, including increased levels of cel-miR-57-5p and cel-miR-249-3p, and decreased cel-miR-72-3p and cel-miR-77-5p. mir-57 and mir-249 mutant strains had enhanced fertility, survival and lifespan, whereas mir-72 and mir-77 mutant strains had diminished fertility, survival and lifespan. Interestingly both miR-77 and mir-249 mutant strains had disrupted mitochondrial morphology and reduced fitness following exercise. The exercise related miRs identified in C. elegans did not have conserved mammalian orthologs. Exercise regulated mammalian miRs were identified from the literature including mmu-miR-181a-5p, mmu-miR-199a-5p and mmu-miR-378a-3p. Treatment of murine myoblasts with mmu-miR-181a-5p and mmu-miR-378a-3p enhanced mitochondrial content, autophagy markers and myogenesis, while mmu-miR-199a-5p impaired these processes.

To elucidate TDP-43-associated dysfunctions in this process, we exploited in cellulo and in vivo models of TDP-43 proteinopathy integrating multiple ribosome profiling techniques, a tag-free miniaturized polysomal profiling coupled with RNA sequencing, and biochemical assays with subcellular (i.e., cell body and axon) and compartment-specific (i.e., RNA granules and polysomes) resolution. Across ALS models, we identified a systemic dysregulation in translation, characterized by: i) widespread axonal- and polysome-specific downregulation of TDP-43 target mRNAs, ii) reorganization of mRNA distribution between ribosome-free and polysomal compartments, and iii) altered ribosome dynamics and occupancy with downstream reorganisation of ribosome engagement with mRNAs.

Breeding bee stocks that can cope with these challenges is a priority. Advanced molecular methods (marker-assisted selection, MAS) have enhanced the breeding efficiency of domesticated animals in recent years, but have not contributed strongly to honey bee stock improvements. This is largely because desirable traits of bees usually emerge from collective phenotypes of workers (sterile females) instead of from the breeding individuals (queens and male drones). For collective phenotypes, single genes typically have small, additive effects, so identifying impactful MAS targets is challenging. Here, we provide proof of concept for a new approach to honey bee breeding through MAS using the multifunctional protein Vitellogenin (Vg), a protein known to interact with and mitigate the primary drivers of colony loss. Our pipeline leverages cutting-edge, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven protein structure modeling algorithms to predict the effects of genetic variants of Vg on relevant molecular functions including lipid, zinc, and DNA binding. Following the AI-powered Vg variant selection step, we use a combination of standard apicultural techniques and DNA sequencing validation to breed honey bee queens homozygous for the desirable Vg allele.

Phenotypic nonspecificity in Drosophila melanogaster is not dependent on the DNA binding specificity of the TFs and generally due to genetic complementation. Two TF phenotypes (doublesex [dsx] and apterous [ap]) are rescued by multiple TFs. The rescue by resident TFs, and the rescue and non-rescue by non-resident TFs, of these two phenotypes were used to distinguish between three possible outcomes of the comparison of the TF-dependent mRNA accumulation in these two systems. First, the sets of TF-dependent mRNAs are independent and non-overlapping; second, the sets of TF-dependent mRNAs are independent and overlapping; and third, the sets of TF-dependent mRNAs are constrained and have extensive overlap. The transcriptomes associated with rescue by resident TFs, and rescue and non-rescue by non-resident TFs, of the two TF phenotypes (dsx and ap) provided many examples of extensive overlap indicating regulation of constrained sets of genes. However, the strength of correlation of transcript accumulation observed between the resident and non-resident TFs was not a strong predictor for rescue of the phenotype by the non-resident TFs. The regulation of a constrained set of genes supports the hypothetical assembly of TFs into wolfpacks, and not the hypothetical limited specificity of TF function, as a potential explanation of phenotypic nonspecificity.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

CaM, which binds and allosterically activates eEF-2K in the presence of calcium, contains two structural lobes, each with a pair of calcium-binding EF-hands. Using kinetic analysis, we demonstrate that the isolated C-terminal lobe of CaM (CaMC) is sufficient to engage and fully activate eEF-2K in a calcium-dependent fashion. Genetically fusing CaMC to the N-terminus of eEF-2K, upstream of its critical CaM-targeting motif (CTM) via a flexible 2-glycine linker, results in a chimeric species (C-LiNK) that is constitutively active independent of external CaM and calcium. A structure of the C-LiNK functional core reveals no significant deviation in the overall conformations of the interacting modules and orientations of key catalytic-site residues relative to the heterodimeric complex between full-length CaM and eEF-2K. These observations demonstrate that, in contrast to other CaM-regulated kinases, CaMC alone is sufficient to activate eEF-2K fully. The proximity effect of CaMC in the context of C-LiNK removes the requirement for external calcium, whose apparent role is to enhance the CaM-affinity of eEF-2K and drive kinase activation. The responsiveness of eEF-2K to regulatory stimuli in cells appears to be lost in C-LiNK, presumably due to its permanently 'on' state.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Diminished contractile reserve is a hallmark of a diseased heart; assessing contractile reserve is pivotal in prognosticating and monitoring CVD progression. The Frank-Starling mechanism and sympathetic stimulation are key to enhance contractile reserve but have not been explored in vivo in old and obese mouse models of CVD. This project aims to use speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) to characterize the function of the heart at baseline, with increased preload, and with sympathetic stimulation. We hypothesize that along with blunted systolic function, diastolic function, and contractility, old and obese mice will have a blunted contractile reserve. Methods: STE was obtained for control (4-month-old), aged (24-month-old), and obese mice (high fat diet-induced). Mice received an intravenous injection of 150L saline to increase preload to assess the Frank-Starling response, followed by injection of {beta}1adrenergic receptor agonist dobutamine to assess sympathetic response. Results: At baseline, aging and obese mice demonstrated blunted systolic, diastolic function, and contractility. Endocardial and epicardial wall displacement differed between aging and obese mice with contractile reserve, indicating that they have functionally distinct cardiac phenotypes. Conclusions: This study is the first to demonstrate blunted systolic function, diastolic function, and contractility through STE in aging and obese mice.

We found no differences in anti-Veillonella parvula serum IgG by HIV status, but IgG titers did correlate with microbial translocation markers sCD14 and LBP in HIV. In vitro studies demonstrated that Veillonella parvula increased oral epithelial barrier permeability and induced monocyte activation. Conclusions: The oral microbiome, particularly Veillonella parvula, may contributes to systemic inflammation in HIV through mechanisms involving epithelial barrier disruption, oral translocation, and monocyte activation.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

J.; Saunders, B. T.", "abstract": "Adaptive decision making relies on proper discrimination and prediction of positive and negative events. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is central to this valence encoding, assigning emotional value to stimuli to drive appropriate behavioral responses. The ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is classically known to regulate associative learning and incentive motivation via dopamine projections to the striatum, also contains strong dopamine projections to the BLA, but this system has received much less attention. Here, we used fiber photometry to investigate how in vivo BLA dopamine signaling tracks learning. We show that reward cues evoke BLA dopamine signals that diminish, rather than grow, with training. As the complexity of the learning context was increased, where rats actively differentiated between various cue types signaling threat, reward, safety, and neutral associations, the magnitude of cue-evoked BLA dopamine responses was largest early in training and reported the level of perceived emotional saliency. Fear and safety cues prompted larger, sustained dopamine signals compared to reward and neutral cues, an effect that was more apparent in female rats, compared to males. Together, our findings broaden the theoretical landscape of dopamine heterogeneity, showing that BLA dopamine supports dynamic disambiguation of relative stimulus importance by non-associatively encoding sensory state transitions, independent of value. These signals reflect a scalar readout of emotional salience to prime, rather than track, learning.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we provide evidence at the single subject level that humans indeed acquired such incidental associations and reveal their neural signatures by combining Electroencephalography (EEG), multivariate decoding and computational modeling. We found robust encoding of incidental predictions and prediction errors underlying associative learning, consistent with predictive coding theories. Prediction errors were modulated by epistemic uncertainty, incidental associations persisted in memory over days and generalized beyond stimulus-stimulus pairings to encompass broader sensory events, including the absence of stimulation. Together, our results challenge traditional assumptions that associative learning requires behavioral relevance or physical co-occurrence and point to uncertainty minimization about environmental state transitions as a general objective of brain function. This intrinsic drive may reflect a fundamental computational principle supporting the formation of internal predictive models that guide perception, learning, and adaptive behavior.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Despite the identification of several genes associated with PM subtypes, the etiology remains unclear in a significant proportion of patients. Here, we reported two de novo nonsense mutations in the NUSAP1 gene identified in two independent PM families: c.1209 C>G (p.Tyr403*) and c.1213C>T (p.Gln405*). Nusap1-edited mouse models, designed to mimic Human NUSAP1 mutations, replicated the microcephaly phenotype, characterized by a small brain and thinner cerebral cortex. We demonstrated that Nusap1 was specifically expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), and the number of NSPCs was significantly reduced in Nusap1-edited mice. In vitro experiments revealed that NUSAP1 mutations disrupted mitotic metaphase chromosome alignment, increased polyploidy, induced cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis. Co-IP confirmed direct interactions between NUSAP1 and KIF2C, and showed that truncating mutations impaired their binding. Furthermore, NUSAP1 rescued the cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis caused by KIF2C overexpression in NUSAP1 KO HEK293T cells, whereas the mutant truncated protein failed to exert such a rescue effect. We also uncovered an interaction between NUSAP1 and Aurora kinase A (AURKA). Intriguingly, subsequent experiments revealed that AURKA-mediated phosphorylation of NUSAP1 modulates its binding affinity to KIF2C. In conclusion, our findings established NUSAP1 as a novel pathogenic gene for PM. We proposed a model in which AURKA-mediated phosphorylation of NUSAP1 regulates its interaction with KIF2C, balancing spindle microtubule stability and depolymerization to ensure proper sister chromatid segregation. Disruptions in this pathway impair NSPCs mitosis, thereby affecting neocortical development.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Functional study of those GWAS-identified loci might represent an important step toward understanding AUD pathophysiology. We found that genetic loci which are splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) for the fibronectin III domain containing 4 (FNDC4) gene in the brain were identified by GWAS for both AUD drug treatment outcomes and AUD risk. However, FNDC4 function in the brain and how it might contribute to AUD pathophysiology remain unknown. In the present study, we characterized GWAS locus-associated FNDC4 splice isoforms, studies which suggested that FNDC4 alternative splicing results in loss-of-function for FNDC4. We also investigated FNDC4 function using CRISPR/cas9 gene editing, and the creation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural organoids joined with single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We observed that knock-out (KO) of FNDC4 resulted in a striking shift in the relative proportions of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in iPSC-derived neural organoids, suggesting a possible important role for FNDC4 in neurogenesis. We also explored potential mechanism(s) of FNDC4-dependent neurogenesis with results that suggested a role for FNDC4 in mediating neural cell-cell interaction. In summary, this series of experiments indicates that FNDC4 plays a role in regulating cerebral cortical neurogenesis in the brain. This regulation may contribute to the response to AUD pharmacotherapy as well as the effects of alcohol on the brain.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Leveraging the open-access CamCAN dataset, comprising structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alongside magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 599 adults spanning ages 18 to 88 years, we systematically investigated age-associated changes in multimodal connectomes within the DMN. Our analyses revealed a progressive decline in both structural and functional connectivity among DMN subregions with advancing age. Additionally, MEG-based connectivity assessment demonstrated age-related decreases in high-frequency oscillatory activity (alpha, beta, gamma bands) accompanied by increases in low-frequency oscillations (theta band). Integrating structural data with neurophysiological measures further revealed age-dependent shifts in neurophysiological-structural coupling within the prefrontal cortex, characterized by strengthened coupling at theta frequencies but weakened coupling at higher frequencies. Conversely, coupling within the posterior cingulate cortex consistently declined across all examined frequency bands. Notably, theta-band coupling within the prefrontal cortex significantly correlated with age-related memory performance variations. Collectively, our findings delineate nuanced changes in DMN information transmission dynamics across adulthood, underscoring its promise as a neurobiological biomarker reflective of cognitive aging heterogeneity.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Single cell RNA sequencing along with histological and anatomical assessments were performed in NDUFS4 KO mice and compared with controls to determine the impact of Complex I deficiency on neural stem cells, their neuronal and oligodendroglial progeny, lineage progression, and overt differences in specific brain regions. Our findings show disruptions in all categories, specifically within the subventricular zone and corpus callosum.

Traditionally, GABAergic input was considered as the gatekeeper, thus, receptors closest to the soma were ideally placed to veto excitation. However, recently modeling has advanced several counter-intuitive hypotheses. Since laser uncaging can be directed at will to any position, we used photostimulation to show that inhibition near the sealed end of dendrites distal to excitation is more effective than inhibition near the soma in modulating excitation. Further, dendritic inhibition was found to be branch specific. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibitory input from multiple thin basal dendrites can centripetally elevate to effectively tune distant excitation at the soma. These findings provide direct experimental evidence supporting theoretical predictions based on dendritic cable properties, revealing the critical role of dendritic geometry in shaping the interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Despite the progress in generating neural tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), an organoid model that recapitulates the key features of cerebellar development has not been widely established. Here, we report the generation of a 60-day method for human cerebellar organoids (hCBOs) that is characterized by induction of rhombomere 1 (R1) cellular identity followed by derivation of neuronal and glial cell types of the cerebellum. In contrast to forebrain organoids with multiple neural rosettes and inside-out neuronal migration, hCBOs develop a SOX2+ cerebellar plate on the outermost surface of organoids with outside-in neuronal migration, which is a characteristic hallmark of cerebellar histogenesis. These hCBOs produced various other cell types including granule neurons, Purkinje cells, Golgi neurons, and deep cerebellar nuclei. By using a glial induction strategy, we generate Bergmann glial cells (BGCs) within the hCBOs that not only serve as scaffolds for granule cells migration but also enhance electrophysiological response of the hCBOs. Furthermore, by generating hCBOs from patients with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), we revealed abnormal disease-specific phenotypes that could be reversed by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and gene editing by CRISPR-Cas9. Taken together, our advanced hCBO model provides new opportunities to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cerebellar ontogenesis and utilize patient-derived iPSCs for translational research.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

Previous studies in Drosophila wing epithelia have shown that imbalances in the amount of core PCP proteins (core proteins) between adjacent cells disrupt PCP. In contrast, various tissues maintain PCP despite containing multiple cell types with different levels of core proteins. The mechanisms by which these tissues resist imbalances in core protein levels and preserve PCP remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that cell-type distribution plays a crucial role in resisting such imbalances. In the mouse oviduct, Secretory cells (SCCs) have low levels of core proteins, whereas multiciliated cells (MCCs) exhibit high levels. We found that SCCs are aligned along the ovary-uterus axis that is consistent with the orientation of the oviduct PCP. Furthermore, through a combination of mathematical modeling, deep learning, and statistical modeling, we showed that orientation of cell-type alignment is a key aspect of cell-type distribution that affects PCP. As predicted by these theoretical analyses, core proteins were locally misoriented where SCCs were not aligned along the ovary-uterus axis. Finally, we found that in oviducts lacking the core protein CELSR1, the alignment of SCCs was disrupted, suggesting that positive feedback regulation between core proteins and cell alignment contributes to PCP maintenance. Our findings highlight the overlooked role of spatial arrangement of cell-types in PCP maintenance that is essential for the proper function of epithelial tissues.", "date": "2025-05-16", "journal": ""}

We genotyped 23.8 M small variants and 79.3 k SVs to perform association testing with molecular phenotypes derived from a subset of 117 bulls with total RNA sequencing data from testis tissue. We identified 27.3 k molecular QTL including 316 for which SVs were the top variants. This corresponds to a 2.1- and 5.6-fold enrichment of SVs among expression and splicing QTL, respectively. When considering SVs in perfect LD with the lead small variant, the enrichment increased to 6.1- and 12-fold for expression and splicing QTL, respectively. Imperfect genotyping for large SVs and other variants limited our ability to detect all SV top variants, suggesting that the true enrichment of SVs among molecular QTL may be even higher.
