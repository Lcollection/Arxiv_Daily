O.; Wang, Z.; Zhang, H.; Liu, Y.", "abstract": "The rapid global expansion of artificial light at night (ALAN) has spurred growing interest in its ecological impact on plant life. However, the effects of low-intensity ALAN on plants in their natural habitats remain largely unexplored, particularly concerning the influence of morphological and phenological responses on the overall fitness of these plants. We conducted a field experiment using the annual herbaceous plant Elsholtzia densa as a model species to assess the effects of ALAN on plant morphology, reproductive phenology, and reproductive capacity. The results indicate that ALAN increased the specific leaf area and elongated the top inflorescences, but it resulted in a reduction of secondary branches and a decrease in the proportion of individuals with undeveloped top inflorescences. Additionally, ALAN induced a shift in biomass allocation toward the aboveground parts of plants. It also accelerated the onset of budding, blooming, fruiting, and seed maturity by 3.4 to 6.2 days and caused a decrease in the number of fruity inflorescences. This study suggests that ALAN can significantly affect plant morphology, reproductive timing, and potentially the fitness of plants. While ALAN induces potentially adaptive changes in leaf area and biomass allocation, it may also disrupt plant-pollinator interactions and negatively impact plant reproductive capacity.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

This study focused on identifying \"hub genes\" that might drive DA neuron degeneration in familial and idiopathic PD. The gene expression data from three publicly available datasets were reanalyzed. These datasets included samples from DA neurons derived from postmortem brains and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Twelve hub genes were identified to be dysregulated across all three datasets. The hub genes were found to play vital roles in membrane trafficking and vesicle-mediated transport. NetworkAnalyst-based reconstruction linked these hub genes to various other diseases. Experimental validation in neurotoxin-induced SH-SY5Y cell models of PD confirmed significant changes in the mRNA levels of some of the hub genes. Crucially, silencing one of the hub genes in Caenorhabditis elegans promoted DA neuron degeneration.

While mRNA methylation such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) that was widely studied in memory, the role of mRNA acetylation remains largely unknown. N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), the only known form of RNA acetylation in eukaryotes, promotes mRNA stability and translation. In this study, we identified the ac4C epitranscriptome in mouse hippocampal homogenates and synaptosomes through ac4C-RNA immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (acRIP-seq). The task of Morris water maze (MWM) was employed to induce and evaluate memory acquisition and forgetting processes. We show that synaptic ac4C levels are dynamically regulated, increasing after memory formation and returning to baseline after natural forgetting. The dynamic changes of ac4C-mRNAs regulated by memory were validated by ac4C dot-blot, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and acRIP-qPCR analysis. We further demonstrate that NAT10, the ac4C writer, in mouse hippocampus is important for spatial memory via regulating memory-related mRNAs, proteins, and ultimately synaptic plasticity. Lastly, we generated a freely-accessible website (http://ac4catlas.com) that included the dataset of ac4C epitranscriptome in mouse hippocampus.

Previous studies have mainly examined relative brain size, but a comprehensive understanding of brain diversity requires the investigation of other aspects of their neuroanatomy. Here, we obtained primarily post-mortem brain scans from twenty-six species of the order Carnivora, spanning across eight families with diverse representatives and including additional individuals for selected species, to create the largest Carnivoran brain collection to date. We then reconstructed their cortical surfaces, and examined neocortical sulcal anatomy to establish a framework for systematic inter-species comparisons. We observed distinct regional variations in sulcal anatomy, potentially related to the species' behaviour and ecology. Arctoidea species with pronounced forepaw dexterity exhibited complex sulcal configurations in the presumed somatosensory cortex but low sulcal complexity in the presumed visual and auditory occipitotemporal cortex. Canidae had the largest number of unique major sulci with a unique sulcus in the occipital cortex and highly social canids featuring an additional frontal cortex sulcus. We also observed differentially complex occipito-temporal sulcal patterns in Felidae and Canidae, indicative of changes in auditory and visual areas that may be related to foraging strategies and social behaviour. In conclusion, this study presents an inventory of the sulcal anatomy of a number of rarely studied carnivoran brains including detailed digital atlases and establishes a framework and novel avenues for further investigations employing a variety of neuroimaging modalities to reveal more about carnivoran brain diversity.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

However, bioinformatic tools to pre- and post-process data from Bayesian divergence time estimation analyses are often not easily interoperable, and documenting methodological choices is not a generalized practice. The R package tbea is a tool-set to integrate biological, geological and palaeontological information to optimize the specification of models, their parameters and prior distributions in divergence times estimation analyses. tbea implements statistical models to (i) better translate time information in dating sources into the specified calibration densities, (ii) improve comparisons between prior and posterior distributions for parameters of interest, (iii) carry out inference on origination times for a set of distributions, (iv) summarise different distributions into a single one, and (v) improve the reproducibility of divergence time estimation analyses allowing users to document methodological choices. We illustrate the package functionalities by carrying out two worked examples. One on the phylogenetic relationships and divergence time estimation of South American Cynodontidae, and another one on the separation time of drainages East and West of the Andes in South America. It is expected that the tools herein available will be key when estimating events in time from sets of point estimates, as well as the combination of different posterior densities from the same parameter are useful to justifying the selection of secondary calibration points, or discussing the timing of biogeographic events when multiple sources are available.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

While it is known that these different interactions alter animal behaviour, their relative impacts are not well understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the past 30 years of research, focusing on changes in foraging, vigilance, and movement behaviours in wild animals. Our results show that lethal human activities cause significant behavioural changes, with targeted species increasing vigilance and reducing foraging in affected areas. Active non-lethal activities elicited similar but generally weaker patterns, with many species showing little to no change in the magnitude of behavioural response. In contrast, passive non-lethal interactions, like those involving roads and development, produced highly variable responses depending on the species. These findings illustrate the importance of differentiating between types of human activity when considering their effects on wildlife. Notably, the most pronounced behavioural changes occurred where humans posed a direct lethal threat.

E.", "abstract": "Automated invertebrate classification using computer vision has shown significant potential to improve specimen processing efficiency. However, challenges such as invertebrate diversity and morphological similarity among taxa can make it difficult to infer fine-scale taxonomic classifications using computer vision. As a result, many invertebrate computer vision models are forced to make classifications at coarser levels, such as at family or order. Here we propose a novel modular method to combine computer vision and bulk DNA metabarcoding specimen processing pipelines to improve the accuracy and taxonomic granularity of individual specimen classifications. To improve specimen classification accuracy, our methods use multimodal fusion models that combine image data with DNA-based assemblage data. To refine the taxonomic granularity of the models classifications, our methods cross-references the classifications with DNA metabarcoding detections from bulk samples. We demonstrated these methods using a continental-scale, invertebrate bycatch dataset collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network. We also introduce the CV.eDNA R package, which aims to assist practitioners looking to implement our methods. Using our methods, we reached a classification accuracy of 79.6% across the 17 taxa using real DNA assemblage data, and 83.6% when the assemblage data was error-free, resulting in a 2.2% and 6.2% increase in accuracy when compared to a model trained using only images. After cross-referencing with the DNA metabarcoding detections, we improved taxonomic granularity in up to 72.2% of classifications, with up to 5.7% reaching species-level. By providing computer vision models with coincident DNA assemblage data, and refining individual classifications using DNA metabarcoding detections, our methods the potential to greatly expand the capabilities of biological computer vision classifiers. Our methods allow computer vision classifiers to infer taxonomically fine-grained classifications when it would otherwise be difficult or impossible due to challenges of morphologic similarity or data scarcity. These methods are not limited to terrestrial invertebrates and could be applied in any instance where image and DNA metabarcoding data are concurrently collected.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we present an individual-based model of mutation accumulation, where random mutations in cancer cells trigger specialised immune responses. Unlike previous research, we explicitly model interactions between cancer and effector cells and incorporate stochastic effects, which are important for the expansion and extinction of small populations. We find that the parameters governing interactions between the cancer and effector cells induce different outcomes of tumour progress, such as suppression and evasion. While it is hard to measure the cancer-immune dynamics directly, genetic information of the cancer may indicate the presence of such interactions. Our model demonstrates signatures of selection in sequencing-derived summary statistics, such as the single-cell mutational burden distribution.

At thermal equilibrium, ligand specificity is limited by the relative affinities of ligands for their receptors. Here, we present a non-equilibrium model in which receptors overcome thermodynamic constraints to preferentially signal from specific ligands while suppressing others. In our model, multi-site phosphorylation and active receptor degradation act in concert to regulate ligand specificity, with receptor degradation providing a previously under-appreciated layer of control. Here, ligand-bound receptors undergo sequential phosphorylation, with progression restarted by ligand unbinding or receptor turnover. High-affinity complexes are kinetically sorted toward degradation-prone states, while low-affinity complexes are sorted towards inactivated states, both limiting signaling. As a result, network activity is maximized for ligands with intermediate affinities. This mechanism explains paradoxical experimental observations in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, including non-monotonic dependence of signaling output on ligand affinity and kinase activity. Given the ubiquity of multi-site phosphorylation and ligand-induced degradation across signaling receptors, we propose that kinetic sorting may be a general non-equilibrium ligand-discrimination strategy used by multiple signaling receptors.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

We generated an IVT modification-free reference transcriptome from K562 cells and used Nanocompore to compare it to the native RNA. We detected 26,619 modification sites across 2,520 isoforms from 1,766 genes. We used motif and annotation-based inference to identify at least eight distinct RNA modifications, with m6A and m5C being the most prevalent. Importantly, we uncovered non-random co-occurrence of m6A and m5C on both the same transcripts and a subset of the same molecules, suggesting potential combinatorial regulation. Furthermore, RNA modification patterns were often isoform-specific, pointing to a link between the epitranscriptome and alternative splicing. This approach also revealed previously underexplored modification patterns in mitochondrial mRNAs, suggesting broader regulatory complexity than previously appreciated.

To address this, we mimicked the striatal neuroinflammation that is frequently exhibited in individuals with compulsive disorders in rats, by injecting the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide into the posterior dorsomedial striatum, and assessed the consequences for behavioural control. Surprisingly, this manipulation caused rats to acquire and maintain goal-directed actions under conditions that would otherwise produce habits. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that these behaviours were a result of astrocytic proliferation. To probe this further, we chemogenetically activated the Gi-pathway in striatal astrocytes, which altered the firing properties of nearby medium spiny neurons and modulated goal-directed action control. Together, results show that striatal neuroinflammation is sufficient to bias action selection toward excessive goal-directed control via dysregulated astrocyte function. If translatable, our findings suggest that, contrary to conventional views, individuals with striatal neuroinflammation might be more prone to maladaptive goal-directed actions than habits, and future interventions should aim to restore appropriate action control.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Transcriptomic analysis revealed 361 differentially expressed genes between the proband and the euploid revertant, highlighting genes both within and outside the 8p region that may contribute to 8p syndrome pathology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proband exhibits a significant defect in neural differentiation that could be partially rescued by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of cell death.

However, until recently, biological based candidates for quantum sensors have been limited to in vitro systems, were prone to light induced degradation, and the experimental setups involved are typically not amenable to high-throughput study as would enable further engineering e.g. via directed evolution. We recently created a new class of magneto-sensitive fluorescent proteins (MFPs), which we show overcome these challenges and represent a new form of engineered biological quantum sensors that function both at physiological conditions and in living cells. Through directed evolution, we demonstrate the possibility of engineering these proteins to alter properties of their response to magnetic fields and radio frequencies. These effects are explained in terms of the radical pair mechanism (RPM), involving the protein backbone and a bound flavin cofactor. Using this engineered system we demonstrate the first observation of a fluorescent protein exhibiting Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) in living bacterial cells at room temperature, at sufficiently high signal-to-noise to be detected in a single cell. These magnetic resonance and magnetic field effects measured via fluorescence enable novel technologies; examples we demonstrate include spatial localisation of fluorescence signals using gradient fields (i.e. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using a genetically encoded probe), sensing of the molecular microenvironment, multiplexing of bio-imaging, and lock-in detection, overcoming typical fluorescence imaging challenges of light scattering and autofluorescence.

L.; Gohil, C.; Marquand, A.; Vidaurre, D.", "abstract": "Many brain diseases and disorders lack objective measures of brain function as indicators of pathology. The search for brain function biomarkers is complicated by the fact that these conditions are often heterogenous and described as a spectrum from normal to abnormal rather than a sick-healthy dichotomy. Normative modelling addresses these challenges by characterizing the normal variation of brain function given sex and age and identifying abnormalities as deviations from this norm. Focusing on functional connectivity (FC) as a way to capture the network properties of the brain's activity, we here argue that the pathological effects of neurological or psychiatric disease lie at the systemic level, and that whole-brain normative models are more suitable to capture individual variations associated to these complex conditions than existing localized approaches that analyze one connection at a time. To be able to capture the whole-brain effects of disease, we thus propose Functional Connectivity Integrative Normative Modelling (FUNCOIN) as a novel whole-brain approach to normative modelling of FC. Using FUNCOIN and UK Biobank resting-state fMRI data from 46,000 healthy subjects across training and testing sets, we found that subjects with bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease were significantly, and substantially, more likely than healthy subjects to exhibit abnormal FC patterns, which was not seen in localized models.

In this method, regressors are derived with PCA from a noise ROI, an area defined outside of the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid. A parallel analysis is used to systematically determine how many components to retain as regressors for modeling; this designated a median of 9 regressors across four fMRI datasets: motor task (n=26), breathing task (n=27), and resting state (n=15 and n=10). First-level fMRI modeling demonstrated that principal component regressors did fit noise (e.g., physiological noise from blood vessels), though the effectiveness may be dependent upon the acquisition parameters.

Our results reveal that, while a minority of neurons initially conveyed significant information about the behavior of the animal, the bulk of task-related activity only emerged after the animals reached proficient performance. Although goal arm information is robustly represented at both the single-cell and network levels both during learning and in task proficient mice, it undergoes significant remapping throughout the learning process. Additionally, we identified the establishment of recurring sequences during learning and their replay at reward locations, with no evidence of them existing during odor sampling phase, during sleep or before training.

The iTBS-tACS Peak shows the most significant and stable increase in gamma oscillatory activities (up to 2 hours), followed by 40-Hz tACS and 40-Hz iTBS. 40-Hz tACS and 40-Hz iTBS had the strongest acute effects (up to 30 min) on induced gamma oscillations, while 40-Hz tACS most consistently induced gamma oscillations for up to 2 hours in overall resting EEG data. Phase-synchronizing iTBS with tACS at 40 Hz and the 40 Hz tACS alone targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, may be a viable approach for inducing and stabilizing gamma oscillatory activity, particularly in conditions where endogenous gamma oscillatory is attenuated, such as Alzheimers Disease.\n\nRegistration IDs:101017716 (CORDIS - European Union-funded project)", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

P.; Yan, X.; Grissom, N.; Herman, A.; Ebitz, B.", "abstract": "1People differ widely in how they make decisions in uncertain environments. While many studies leverage this variability to measure differences in specific cognitive processes and parameters, the key dimension(s) of individual variability in uncertain decision-making tasks has not been identified. Here, we analyzed behavioral data from 1001 participants performing a restless three-armed bandit task, where reward probabilities fluctuated unpredictably over time. Using a novel analytical approach that controlled for the stochasticity in this tasks, we identified a dominant nonlinear axis of individual variability. We found that this primary axis of variability was strongly and selectively correlated with the probability of exploration, as inferred by latent state modeling. This suggests that the major factor shaping individual differences in bandit task performance is the tendency to explore (versus exploit), rather than personality characteristics, reinforcement learning model parameters, or low-level strategies. Certain demographic characteristics also predicted variance along this principle axis: participants at the exploratory end tended to be younger than participants at the exploitative end, and self-identified men were overrepresented at both extremes. Together, these findings offer a principled framework for understanding individual differences in task behavior while highlighting the cognitive and demographic factors that shape individual differences in decision-making under uncertainty.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular basis of hippocampal lateralization in response to environmental stimuli remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the transcriptomic profiles of the left and right hippocampal CA1 regions in rats reared under isolated or enriched housing conditions to elucidate hemisphere-specific responses and shared molecular adaptations. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed lateralized differences in the number and identity of differentially expressed genes, accompanied by distinct biological themes, as indicated by overrepresentation and gene set enrichment analysis. The left CA1 region was prominently engaged in pathways related to synaptic organization and mitochondrial function, whereas the right CA1 region exhibited enrichment in transcriptional regulation and RNA metabolic processes. Despite these asymmetries, co-expression and protein-protein interaction network analyses revealed shared molecular architectures. Immediate early genes formed consistent central hubs across both hemispheres, and a common Mecp2-Grin2b-Cdkl5-Tet3 protein interaction cluster was identified as a potential integrative regulatory module. Additional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes shared between hemispheres further highlighted conserved responses, particularly in synaptic plasticity and cell-cell communication. Together, these findings demonstrate that the left and right CA1 regions employ distinct yet partially convergent transcriptional programs to adapt to environmental stimuli. This coordinated molecular asymmetry provides novel insights into hippocampal lateralization and its role in experience-dependent brain plasticity.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer patients have the highest rates and most severe forms of cancer cachexia, yet cachexia etiologies remain largely elusive, leading to a lack of effective intervening therapies. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) has been clinically implicated as a putative regulator of cachexia, with serum PTHrP levels correlating with increased weight loss in PDAC patients. Here we show that cachectic PDAC patients have high expression of tumor PTHrP and use a genetically engineered mouse model to functionally demonstrate that loss of PTHrP blocks cachectic wasting, dramatically extending overall survival. The re-expression of PTHrP in lowly cachectic models is sufficient to induce wasting and reduce survival in mice, which is reversed by the conditional deletion of the PTHrP receptor, Pth1r, in adipocytes. Mechanistically, tumor-derived PTHrP suppresses de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes, leading to a molecular rewiring of adipose depots to promote wasting in the cachectic state. Finally, the pharmacological disruption of the PTHrP-PTH1R signaling axis abrogates wasting, highlighting that a targeted disruption of tumor-adipose crosstalk is an effective means to limit cachexia. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the prototypical cancer type associated with cancer cachexia, a debilitating wasting syndrome marked by adipose tissue loss and muscle atrophy. Herein, we establish that PTHrP is a tumor-derived factor that facilitates cachexia by downregulating de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes and that blocking PTHrP is an effective means to limit wasting in preclinical mouse models.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

How this dimension is progressively structured during infancy and articulated at the neural level is a critical question for cognitive and affective neurosciences. This systematic review aims to define the neural signatures of temporal prediction in newborns and infants and to discuss them in the context of the development of proximal cognitive and affective neural functions. Eight peer-reviewed studies were included, with 228 infants from birth to 9 months of age. Studies have shown that the neural signatures of temporal prediction in infants exhibit a broad cerebral localization, including the anterior and medial parts of the brain, particularly in the frontal and central areas. Temporal prediction mechanisms emerge before birth and range from early sensory-driven responses to more complex top-down processes within the first year of life. While current data do not support a clear longitudinal interpretation, these abilities appear to be shaped by both biological predispositions and experiential factors, with interactive rhythmic and musical activities potentially contributing to their development.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

K.; Pasqualini, R.; Arap, W.", "abstract": "In humans, protein-protein interactions mediate numerous biological processes and are central to both normal physiology and disease. Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2 based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database. We assessed the predicted interaction structures through different confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we examined annotated protein domains and found that 679 of the predicted structural complexes contained a variety of domains with putative interaction involvement on the basis of interaction interface proximity. Furthermore, our analyses revealed intricate interaction networks within the context of biological function and cancer. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, highlighting both strengths and limitations, while also providing a novel view of broad functional contextualization. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

This investigation was undertaken to determine the effect o shifting sowing date on a cohort of six high yielding spring wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.), by delaying sowing date 15 and 30 days in a two-year field trial, aiming to highlight agronomic traits contributing to sustained yield potential under heat stress induced by late sowing, with a focus on identifying tolerant cultivars. Our findings showed that heat stress was detrimental when occurred during anthesis stage. Late sowing shifted the timing of heat stress, resulting in floral abortion and significantly reduced number of grains/spike. More importantly, some cultivars showed significant reduction following delaying sowing date, together with the strong correlation with yield especially at late sowing (r=0.74), imposing up to 42% yield penalty in the heat stressed late sowing conditions. On the contrary, harvest index of sowing delayed by 30 days was significantly higher compared to both 15 days late sowing and the optimum sowing date, suggesting that decline in biological yield exceeded that of grain yield. Upon shifting sowing date, the strength of traits association is altered, grain yield associations showed the strongest positive correlation in the 30 days late sowing with plant height (r=0.86), in the 15 days late sowing with number of total tillers/m2 (r=0.63) and in optimum sowing date with biological yield (r= 0.62), suggesting that grain yield enhancement through selected traits with direct or indirect contributions should be evaluated independently across different growing conditions.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Reactivation can be biased during sleep using odors or sounds through a technique termed targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Here, we attempted to selectively weaken memories by reactivating them together with forgetting instructions. We delivered sounds to reactivate spatial memories and concurrent odors to reactivate instructions. Participants learned about the instructions in a Directed-Forgetting task performed with a list of to-be-remembered and to-be-forgotten words. One odor was linked with instructions to forget, one with instructions to remember, and a third was not assigned any meaning. During a nap, sounds previously linked with object-location learning were presented with these odors. Spatial recall was tested after sleep. Sounds produced a selective recall benefit for weakly encoded memories. However, results did not support the prediction that forgetting could be instilled by the concurrent forget odor. The encoding-strength-dependent benefit was greatest when sounds were presented together with the odor not assigned meaning, whereas the other two odors both disrupted sound-induced memory reactivation. We infer that remember and forget odors, due to the linked instructions and/or multiple learning episodes in the Directed-Forgetting task, evoked sleep-based retrieval that interfered with reactivation of spatial memories. Odors also induced a prolonged decline in sigma EEG power (12-16 Hz) that continued at least 10 s after odor offset.

S.; Putri, D. S.; Wagner, O. I.", "abstract": "Tubulin post-translational modifications (PTM) are critical regulators of microtubule function and diversity in neurons. In Caenorhabditis elegans, we investigated how tubulin deglutamylases (CCPP-1 and CCPP-6) and polyglutamylases (TTLL-5 and TTLL-9) affect kinesin-3 KIF1A/UNC-104-mediated axonal transport. Loss of CCPP-1 not only facilitates tubulin polyglutamylation as expected, but it also leads to increased tyrosination in Western blots. Vice versa, loss of TTLL-5 reduces tubulin polyglutamylation as expected, but also leads to reduced tyrosination signals. This crosstalk in tubulin PTM appears to be a critical feature as no tyrosination or detyrosination enzymes are known in C. elegans. Notably, acetylation and detyrosination remain unaffected in the deglutamylation and polyglutamylation mutants. Functionally, reduced glutamylation and tyrosination improved UNC-104 motility. Conversely, increased glutamylation and tyrosination negatively affected the movement of both the UNC-104 motor and its cargo RAB-3. UNC-104 motors visibly accumulate in neuronal cell bodies of ccpp-1 mutants while being significantly reduced in ttll-5 mutants. In ttll-5 mutants, motors tend to cluster along distal axonal regions and these clusters are reduced in ccpp-1 mutants revealing a role of tubulin PTM in axonal motor scaffolding. Employing promoter fusions, we confirmed that all investigated PTM enzymes express in neurons and colocalize with UNC-104. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that hyperglutamylated tubulin appears in a physical complex with UNC-104, while hypoglutamylated tubulin binds less effectively to the motor. In our model, highly negatively charged polyglutamylated tubulin traps UNC-104 onto microtubules via increased charge-interactions. Tubulin \"stickiness\" is reduced in polyglutamylase mutants leading to increased motor speeds. Reduced synaptic vesicle transport in ccpp-1 mutants has a negative impact on the nematode's touch sensing, highlighting C. elegans as a valuable model for investigating tubulin PTM-related neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

We analyze our new EEG data from a controlled experiment with m-sequence inputs and model the EEG using statistical time series models that mimic biophysical mechanics: an autoregressive (AR) model, adding exogenous input to AR (ARX), adding moving average terms (ARMAX), and finally adding a seasonality term (SARMAX). We implement computational methods to robustly handle model instabilities induced by this data, fitting these models with the Box-Jenkins methodology and assessing forecast performance for long periods of several seconds out-of-sample. We find in-sample fits are good in all models despite the complexities of the visual pathway, and that all models can forecast aspects of EEG: including the distribution of point-wise values in time, the point-wise Pearson's correlation of EEG and model, and the frequency content. Surprisingly, we find little variation in the performance among these models, with the most sophisticated model (SARMAX) performing comparatively poorly in some instances.

The spliceosome defines target splice sites based on sequences located around intron ends and in almost all cases, spliced segments begin with a GT and end with an AG. The key molecules for this function are the spliceosomal RNA (snRNA) and the U2AF heterodimer, which interact with splice signals found at the ends of introns. In chordates, tunicate genomes in the family Fritillariidae (Lohmann, 1915) form a remarkable exception by hosting numerous introns that escape the GT/AG rule, and they represent a material of choice to address the evolution of intron recognition.\n\nA comparison of chordate genomes revealed that the emergence of the unusual splicing code in Fritillaria borealis was accompanied by the duplication of its subunits U2AF1 and U2AF2. We found that the conserved duplicates bind to canonical splice signals on RNA, but different binding was seen with the divergent versions U2AF1{beta} and U2AF2{beta}, suggesting they could recognize other splice sites. When expressed in mammalian cells, U2AF2{beta} promotes the removal of introns that have a weak polypyrimidine tract, and we also show that it interacts specifically with AHCYL1, a protein that can regulate the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of snRNA U2 and U6. In striking contrast with other species, F. borealis has lost m6A on the U6 snRNA while U1 snRNA has gained a stable, 5-terminal m6A. We used structure prediction to show how these modifications could play decisive roles during the recognition of non-GT/AG introns.

M.", "abstract": "Human-leopard conflict poses a significant challenge in the Pauri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand, India, with 290 reported attacks between 2000 and 2020, averaging 13.81 incidents annually. The most affected age group were adults followed by children with a noticeable increase in incidents in winter. Key factors driving this conflict include habitat degradation, loss of prey, and human encroachment. Interestingly, the Gadoli and Manda Khal Fee Simple Estates, an area undergoing ecological restoration, by forest protection through foot patrols, fire watches and passive forest restoration (natural regeneration) within this conflict hotspot, reported no attacks during the same timeframe, highlighting the positive impact of habitat-focused interventions. In contrast, reactive measures such as lethal control lack precision, targeted protocols and long-term efficacy. This study emphasizes ecological restoration as a sustainable strategy for mitigating conflict and calls for improved monitoring of leopard populations, prey species, and habitat conditions. It also offers recommendations for effective conflict management in the region, stressing the advantages of restoration over reactive approaches.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

A.; Miller, K. E.; Shirangi, T. R.", "abstract": "During Drosophila courtship, males chase and sing to females, while females perform abdominal behaviors to indicate their willingness to mate. The nerve cord circuits in females that produce these behaviors are poorly characterized. We recently identified an anatomically diverse population of abdominal interneurons, the DDAG neurons, which express the Tlx-like nuclear receptor dissatisfaction (dsf) and influence several female mating behaviors. Here, we searched the dsf locus for cis-regulatory enhancer fragments that regulate its spatial expression in the adult and larval central nervous system. We found several enhancers, most located within two introns, that drove reporter expression in subsets of dsf-expressing neurons throughout the brain and nerve cord. Using one of these enhancers, we genetically isolated a single subtype of female-specific DDAG local interneurons. Optogenetic activation of these neurons triggered vaginal plate opening in both unmated and mated females, a behavior used by Drosophila females to signal receptivity to courting males. Our findings offer new reagents to target dsf-expressing cells and new insights into the neural substrates in Drosophila females that express their mating decisions during courtship.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Yet, the diversity of major plant-associated bacteria groups like Hyphomicrobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) remain largely uncharacterized in the phyllosphere, due to limitations of 16S rRNA metabarcoding and biases in reference databases toward model taxa and environments. Using a meta-analysis combining metabarcoding, metagenomics and phylogenomics, we explored the worldwide diversity of leaf-associated Hyphomicrobiales. We confirmed Methylobacterium was ubiquitous in the phyllosphere and revealed the dominance of two under-characterized Hyphomicrobiales taxa: Lichenibacterium, a recently described genus of lichen-associated bacteria previously identified as 1174-901-12 in taxonomic databases, and RH-AL1, an undescribed genus of bacteria related to Beijerinckiaceae, previously isolated from coal slag. Despite their abundance in the phyllosphere, Lichenibacterium and RH_AL1 could not be properly detected by classical 16S rRNA gene barcoding, underlining biases in reference databases and a lack of taxonomic resolution for this marker gene. As for Methylobacterium, a significant proportion of Lichenibacterium and RH-AL1 were also detected in association with lichens and in environments with harsh conditions like exposed surfaces, air and snow, suggesting airborne or waterborne dispersal and high resilience in harsh environments. Overall our study stresses the need to move toward metagenomics and culturomics to increase the representativeness of leaf-associated bacterial taxa in reference databases, and to improve our understanding of the evolutionary and functional mechanisms underpinning bacteria adaptations to living on plants.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Yet, while useful, most ChIP-seq protocols include multiple manual steps that can introduce inconsistency and make it burdensome to analyze large sample sets, limiting the inclusion of appropriate replicates and other controls. Although some of these challenges were addressed by incorporation of liquid handling platforms, most of those previous efforts have automated only a subset of the ChIP-seq steps. Further, using automation for efficiently mapping non-histone proteins, such as chromatin regulators, has been challenging. We recently developed a single-pot ChIP-seq protocol1. Here we established a liquid handler operation for this protocol and created an end-to-end fully automated version that is scalable from 8 to 96 ChIP-seq reactions. Our single-pot automated (spa-ChIP-seq) protocol requires about 3 days from cross-linked cells to library, and the costs to produce indexed libraries is approximately $70 per sample. We first benchmarked spa-ChIP-seq against manual ChIP-seq that was performed in parallel, showing a nearly indistinguishable signal-to-noise ratio between the two workflows. Next, we used spa-ChIP-seq to systematically evaluate multiple parameters including shearing and crosslinking conditions, buffer compositions, and antibody to cell-number ratios. Our method allowed us to identify optimal conditions for double crosslinked chromatin as well as easily and robustly conduct titrations and screening of different antibodies and reagents, eliminating many laborious and costly steps. We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the effect of the ratio of antibody to cell-number is most pronounced in detecting weak genomic localization signals. In particular, while strong signal seems to be unimpacted by low antibody to cell-number ratio, weaker signals are sensitive to this ratio. We note the importance of maintaining a consistent antibody to cell-number ratio, especially when conducting comparative studies, e.g., between treatments such as small molecules, or individuals such as for chromatin-QTL mapping. Our automated ChIP-seq protocol is publicly available, including specific deck setups, software files and parameters. Lastly, we envision that our robust, cost-efficient protocol can advance research via multiple fronts, e.g., by (i) allowing the scaling up the number of replicates and conditions tested, (ii) improving quantification precision when using spike-in normalization in ChIP-seq experiments2, (iii) enabling core facilities to provide high-throughput ChIP-seq as a service and (iv) being incorporated into antibody evaluation procedures, compound screening, population genomics and diagnostic frameworks.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

D.; Moscovitch, M.", "abstract": "The human hippocampus is studied via two competing frameworks: one dividing it into discrete anatomical subfields with distinct computational processes, and another describing it as a continuous, functional gradients along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes. How these organizational principles relate to one another, particularly regarding intrinsic neural timescales of the hippocampus, remains unknown. Here, we used high-resolution resting-state fMRI to investigate how single-voxel autocorrelation, a measure of intrinsic neural timescale, maps onto hippocampal subfields. We found evidence for a hybrid organization. First, consistent with our predictions, we observed significantly higher autocorrelation (longer timescales) in the subiculum compared to the other subfields. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that CA1, which is implicated in integration, had low autocorrelation whereas CA2/3 and CA4DG, which are linked to pattern separation, had intermediate autocorrelation. Second, we discovered that the overarching anterior-posterior and medial-lateral gradients of autocorrelation were recapitulated within each individual subfield. Finally, data-driven clusters of autocorrelation values aligned more strongly with the continuous gradients than with the discrete anatomical boundaries, particularly in the right hemisphere. These results suggest that the discrete and continuous views of hippocampal organization are not mutually exclusive but coexist across different spatial scales. We therefore propose a new comprehensive model of hippocampal function that integrates both its modular, subfield-specific properties and its graded, large-scale organization.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

However, in open domains like biology, we do not generally have access to exact rules facilitating formal verification at scale, and oftentimes resolve to testing hypotheses in the lab to assess the validity of a prediction. Verification by performing real experiments is slow, expensive, and inherently does not scale with computation. In this work, we show that one can use world models of biology or other prior knowledge as approximate oracles over biological knowledge to utilize as soft verification to train reasoning systems without the need for additional experimental data. We introduce rbio-1, a reasoning model for biology that is post-trained from a pretrained LLM using reinforcement learning and uses learned models of biology to obtain biological knowledge for verification during training. We show that soft verification successfully distills biology world models into rbio, at the example of achieving leading performance on perturbation prediction against the PerturbQA benchmark compared to state-of-the-art models; we demonstrate the benefits of compositions of verifiers to learn more general rbio models.

K.; Grossnickle, D. M.", "abstract": "In non-mammalian synapsids, feeding and hearing are closely linked because some jaw bones are involved in both functions. The evolutionary decoupling of these two systems in early mammals likely catalyzed greater specialization of feeding and hearing. Although fossil osteological changes during this process are well documented, the corresponding evolutionary changes to soft tissue anatomy are less certain. The medial pterygoid muscle is a jaw adductor that is central to this evolutionary transition because in many fossil lineages it inserted near or possibly on jaw bones involved in both feeding and hearing. In therians (placentals and marsupials), the medial pterygoid muscle develops medial to Meckel's cartilage and inserts on the mandibular angular process. Similarly, non-mammalian cynodonts are often reconstructed with a medial pterygoid muscle passing medial to the ossified Meckel's cartilage, inserting on the dentary 'angular' (i.e., pseudangular) process. Thus, the traditional interpretation is that the medial pterygoid remained medial to Meckel's cartilage through the evolutionary transitions from early cynodonts to therians. Here we highlight issues with that interpretation: the medial pterygoid muscle inserts lateral (not medial) to Meckel's cartilage in monotremes and, presumably, early mammal groups (e.g., spalacotherioids) that lacked an angular process. This suggests at least two possible explanatory hypotheses: 1) the medial pterygoid muscle is evolutionarily labile, shifting in position relative to Meckel's cartilage multiple times or 2) the medial pterygoid muscle did not insert on the pseudangular process of non-mammalian cynodonts and instead inserted on the mandibular medial ridge, dorsal to Meckel's cartilage. We advocate for the latter hypothesis, proposed by Patterson (1956), which suggests that the medial pterygoid did not shift medial to Meckel's cartilage until the complete separation of the ear and jaw in cladotherians (therians and close relatives), with the shift in position possibly triggering the evolution of the therian angular process as an insertion site. Patterson's hypothesis is in line with a growing body of evidence that indicate concomitant evolutionary changes of muscles, ears, and jaws at the cladotherian node were important catalysts for the evolution of hearing and feeding specializations in extant mammals.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Physiology seeks to elucidate the intricate network of interactions that sustain life, which often span multiple organs, cell types, and timescales, but a major challenge lies in the inability to simultaneously record time-varying cellular activity throughout the entire body. We developed WHOLISTIC, a method to image second-timescale, time-varying intracellular dynamics across cell-types of the vertebrate body. By advancing and integrating volumetric fluorescence microscopy, machine learning, and pancellular transgenic expression of calcium sensors in transparent young Danio rerio (zebrafish) and adult Danionella, the method enables real-time recording of cellular dynamics across the organism. Calcium is a universal intracellular messenger, with a large array of cellular processes depending on changes in calcium concentration across varying time-scales, making it an ideal proxy of cellular activity. Using this platform to screen the dynamics of all cells in the body, we discovered unexpected responses of specific cell types to stimuli, such as chondrocyte reactions to cold, meningeal responses to ketamine, and state-dependent activity, such as oscillatory ependymal-cell activity during periods of extended motor quiescence. At the organ scale, the method uncovered pulsating traveling waves along the kidney nephron. At the multi-organ scale, we uncovered muscle synergies and independencies, as well as muscle-organ interactions. Integration with optogenetics allowed us to all-optically determine the causal direction of brain-body interactions. At the whole-organism scale, the method captured the rapid brainstem-controlled redistribution of blood flow across the body. Finally, we advanced Whole-Body Expansion Microscopy to provide ground-truth molecular and ultrastructural anatomical context, explaining the spatiotemporal structure of activity captured by WHOLISTIC. Together, these innovations establish a new paradigm for systems biology, bridging cellular and organismal physiology, with broad implications for both fundamental research and drug discovery.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Background: Variation within the prokaryotic pangenome is not random, and natural selection that favours particular combinations of genes appears to dominate over random drift. What is less clear is whether similar phenotypes tend to arise independently within pangenomes, or whether there is a single route through which they evolve. We have previously shown that the wider genomic context is vital to understanding specific phenotypes, such as antimicrobial resistance. Considering the amount of genomic variation we see in many pathogens, the question of routes to resistance and how they arise is particularly urgent. Methods: We hypothesised that mutually exclusive routes to multidrug antimicrobial resistance evolve through distinct yet predictable pathways dependent upon the species-specific pangenomic background. To test this, we developed an integrated pangenomic and machine learning framework to analyse the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in two clinically significant pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Machine learning models uncovered genes statistically linked to particular MDR phenotypes. We then examined whether these genes were significantly associated or dissociated with one another in gene co-occurrence networks and evaluated the importance of genomic context on pairs of genes. Results: We demonstrate three key findings on the evolution of multidrug resistance in our dataset. First, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were distributed across both the core and accessory genomes, challenging the prevailing view that ARGs are typically confined to the accessory genome. Second, we demonstrate that E. coli possesses mutually exclusive pathways to MDR, with several resistance genes showing distinct dissociation patterns, suggesting alternative evolutionary routes to identical MDR phenotypes. Third, the network of ARG coassociations differed significantly between the P. aeruginosa and E. coli pangenomes with 33 gene pairs showing opposite association patterns between species, revealing species-specific genomic constraints on MDR emergence. These findings emphasise that bacterial evolution is more constrained than previously thought and that designing intervention therapies requires consideration of both historical evolutionary trajectories and the specific genomic context in which the resistance phenotypes arose.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify and characterize DH20931, a novel, first-in-class small-molecule agonist of CerS2. We demonstrate that DH20931 directly activates CerS2 with nanomolar potency, leading to significant VLCC accumulation in breast cancer cells. This lipotoxic event induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and triggers apoptosis via the canonical ATF4/CHOP/PUMA signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we uncover a novel interaction between CerS2 and the ER calcium channel, Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R1). We demonstrate that DH20931 promotes this interaction, enhancing ER-mitochondria proximity and facilitating a CerS2-dependent flux of calcium from the ER into mitochondria. This subsequent mitochondrial calcium; overload serves as a critical trigger for apoptosis. In preclinical evaluations, DH20931 potently inhibited the growth of TNBC cells in 2D and 3D cultures and significantly suppressed tumor progression in orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, all while exhibiting a favorable safety profile.

Alterations in brain insulin signalling and metabolism have been linked with Alzheimer's disease in multiple studies.

Moreover, we demonstrate that the Ins2 protein is found in the hippocampus, a brain region with established roles in learning and memory. To specifically determine how insulin produced locally in the brain influences hippocampal function, specifically learning and memory, we used mice with germline Ins2 knockout (Ins2-/-) and the normal complement of wildtype Ins1 alleles. Compensation from the Ins1 gene ensured normal glucose tolerance, normal insulin sensitivity, normal fasting insulin, and normal body weight under these conditions. We assessed visuo-spatial learning and memory in male and female Ins2-/- and wild-type littermate control mice using the Morris water maze. Learning and memory performance of female Ins2-/- mice was significantly impaired relative to wild-type mice, whereas the performance of male Ins2-/- and wild-type mice did not differ. We profiled isolated hippocampi from female Ins2-/- and littermate control mice using RNA sequencing to provide an unbiased analysis of gene expression differences that underlie these behavioural changes. Cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) was significantly reduced in Ins2-/- mice, prompting us to examine adult neurogenesis using exogenous mitotic marker EdU and the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX).

Using postmortem human brain tissue, we investigated the presence, densities and proportions of excitatory/inhibitory neurons in the uncinate fasciculus (UF) and corpus callosum (CC). We also investigated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) to validate our methods by comparing our results with previously reported densities of neurons in cortical WM.

We found that the density of WMN in the vmPFC corresponded with previous independent estimates. The UF displayed a similar, though slightly lower density of WMN compared to the vmPFC, while the CC had a far lower density of WMN than both of these regions. Due to the higher-than-expected density of WMN in the UF, we validated the findings at a second location along the UF temporal segment and confirmed the presence of substantial numbers of WMN in this tract.

Identifying targets outside the current preclinical paradigm is critically important. This study aimed to characterize the landscape of current epilepsy treatments at the level of gene interaction networks and identify novel genetic modifiers of epilepsy as potential novel therapeutic targets. Methods: We performed a functional network analysis to score genes based on their interactions with known epilepsy genes and integrated these functional scores with population-genetic data and drug tractability information. In parallel, we performed a meta-analysis of genome wide association studies of epilepsy-related phenotypes in genetically diverse mice using a large compendium of historical phenotyping data. Genes within mapped loci were prioritized based on functional rankings and genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) was used to identify highly SNPs at evolutionarily constrained positions. Results: Functional network analyses of known epilepsy genes revealed a strong involvement of neurodevelopmental processes in epilepsy pathogenesis, which are not targeted by existing or emerging treatments. Meta-analysis of seizure traits in mice identified 118 non-overlapping loci harboring potential seizure phenotype modifiers. Using functional rankings, we prioritized 168 candidate genes within these loci and used GERP scores to filter down to 75 single-nucleotide polymorphisms as candidate variants within these genes. Among them, five genes -- Ephb2, En2, Cadps2, Igsf21, and Cep170 -- contain regulatory variants in evolutionarily constrained sites. Four of these genes are validated as modifiers of neurological traits, including epilepsy susceptibility. Significance: This study prioritized epilepsy modifier genes that are strongly predicted to influence neurodevelopmental processes that are underrepresented among current therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the identified genes represent novel candidate modifiers with potential clinical relevance. Our systems-level analysis offers a novel view into the potential target landscape, pointing toward promising new directions for disease-modifying treatments.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

To further address these issues, we developed a conditionally releasable and cis-delivering IL-15 immunocytokine (termed PMIS), which can selectively release a free IL-15 superagonist within tumors rather than immobilizing IL-15 to PD-1+ Tregs, thereby potently stimulating CD25+CD8+ T cells.

Administered either alone or in combination with other therapies, PMIS exhibits great potential for inhibiting orthotopic cold tumor and its metastases. Mechanistically, the significant activation of the pre-existing intratumoral CD25+CD8+ T cells and the improved CD25+CD8/Treg ratio contribute to the enhanced antitumor response of PMIS. These findings underscore the indispensable role of CD25+CD8+ T cells in cis-delivering IL-15 and provide a promising strategy for overcoming resistance to therapies and effectively controlling advanced cold tumors.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Leveraging the plasticity of the zebrafish female brain and genetic models lacking microglia and tumor suppressor factors, we provide insight into the mechanisms that establish sex-specific brain dimorphism in zebrafish.

These transformations have typically been characterised in visual pathways ranging from primary visual cortex to inferotemporal cortex. Less is known about how stimulus representations are formatted in other modalities and downstream regions such as the perirhinal cortex (PER), which receives processed sensory input from all modalities and is involved in object recognition. To address this, we investigated neural activity along the somatosensory hierarchy in awake, head-fixed mice receiving tactile whisker stimulation on either side of the face. PCA and stimulus-baseline decoding analyses revealed that PER activity was similar across stimulated sides, while this was not the case in primary somatosensory cortex (wS1). We also performed decoding analyses for the side of stimulation and the stimulus' movement direction and found that wS1 and secondary somatosensory cortex could reliably decode both features. In contrast, PER was shown to be invariant to both features. We also clustered neurons based on their response dynamics, which indicated that the majority of PER neurons did not encode the basic stimulus features. These findings demonstrate that PER is a critical node in the somatosensory processing hierarchy, encoding tactile information in an invariant and abstract format. Together, these insights contribute to a more refined understanding of how perceptual processing in PER contributes to the various cognitive processes it is utilised for.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Anticipatory Cardiac Deceleration (ACD) is observed consistently in anticipation of a stimulus in perceptual tasks, but its relationship with perceptual performance is debated. Previous quantifications of ACD neglect ongoing heart rate oscillations due to RSA, which may have led to inconsistencies in the ACD-related analyses across studies. Here, we suggest a novel approach to estimate trial-averaged RSA amplitude and respiratory phase-independent cardiac deceleration simultaneously, and apply it to an EEG-ECG dataset from a visual detection task. While the total ACD was not associated with perception, dissociating RSA-based and non-respiratory cardiac modulations revealed that they show opposing effects on perceptual performance.

Macrophages (MP) expressing moderate-to-high CD163 were found co-localized with cholangiocytes, T cells, and collagen-producing hepatic stellate cells (HSC).

In validation analyses, bulk RNA-seq data showed higher driver and effector gene scores in PSC with established fibrosis compared to early-stage PSC and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Plasma proteins encoded by MP driver genes were elevated in autoimmune liver disease (AILD) and in patients with elevated ([&ge;]3.29 kPa) liver stiffness on MR elastography.

To better understand population differentiation and phenotypic plasticity of invasive Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica) in Europe, we compared the performance of 45 European knotweed populations, collected across a 2000 km latitudinal transect, in three common gardens with contrasting climatic conditions, one at the southern edge, one in the center, and one at the northern edge of the species European distribution. The plants exhibited strong phenotypic plasticity across the three gardens, with a more acquisitive growth strategy in the southern garden, and a more conservative strategy and change of architecture in the climatically unfavorable north. Although we observed phenotypic selection on several leaf traits, and on the plasticity of leaf thickness, with some selection differences between the gardens, there was little evidence of population differentiation, and none for local adaptation. Only for plant architecture (shrubbiness), we detected heritable population variation in trait means and plasticity. However, variation in plasticity was unrelated to climatic variability of origin, and to plant fitness. Our results suggest that evolutionary processes - local adaptation and evolution of plasticity - did not play a key role in the success of Japanese knotweed in Europe. Instead, its high baseline plasticity appears to be the key factor that makes it such a strong invader across a broad range of environments.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we combine large-scale phylogenetic trees with herbarium data to confirm that, across the evolutionary history of angiosperms, transitions from complex to simple leaf shapes have occurred at a significantly higher rate than the reverse. To investigate whether this directional trend reflects an underlying developmental bias, we simulate evolutionary transitions by introducing random mutations into a well-established computational model of leaf development. Despite excluding selection, the transition rates produced by the model closely align with those observed in the phylogenetic data. This agreement indicates that a strong developmental bias, reflecting the relative ease with which gene regulatory networks generate simple over complex leaves, has played a major role in shaping the evolution of leaf morphology. Our findings echo recent work showing that similar biases towards simplicity influence the evolution of molecular structures, including RNA secondary structures and protein quaternary assemblies.

This assumption underpins predictions about evolutionary dynamics, epistatic interactions, and the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations. Here, we systematically test this assumption using beneficial mutations from early generations of the Escherichia coli Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE). Using flow cytometry-based competition assays, we find that frequency-dependent fitness effects are the norm rather than the exception, occurring in approximately 80\\% of strain pairs tested. Most competitions exhibit negative frequency-dependence, where fitness advantages decline as mutant frequency increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strength of frequency-dependence is predictable from invasion fitness measurements, with invasion fitness explaining approximately half of the biological variation in frequency-dependent slopes. Additionally, we observe violations of fitness transitivity in several strain combinations, indicating that competitive relationships cannot always be predicted from fitness relative to a single reference strain alone. Through high-resolution measurements of within-growth cycle dynamics, we show that simple resource competition explains a substantial portion of the frequency-dependence: when faster-growing genotypes dominate populations, they deplete shared resources more rapidly, reducing the time available for fitness differences to accumulate. Our results demonstrate that even in a simple model system designed to minimize ecological complexity, subtle ecological interactions between closely related genotypes create frequency-dependent selection that can fundamentally alter evolutionary dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Tumor-immune interactions are central to cancer progression and treatment response, driving cell death through immune-mediated killing and resource-limited competition. In early-stage disease or following effective treatment, cancer populations are often small and difficult to observe directly. Disease monitoring therefore relies on the detection of biomarkers such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as noisy proxies to cancer size. However, existing approaches lack robust frameworks to infer tumor burden from these signals when populations approach detection thresholds. To address this, we present a coupled deterministic-stochastic framework that links tumor-immune dynamics to biomarker release. A two-prey, one-predator Lotka-Volterra model captures interactions between immune cells and competing tumor subpopulation under shared resource constraints. Biomarker production is modeled using a linear stochastic differential equation, incorporating ctDNA release from both apoptotic death (immune-mediated) and necrotic death (due to intratumor competition). We derive analytical solutions for the resulting biomarker trajectories, including mean detection time under a minimal detection threshold. These results show how volatility in measured biomarker signal, disease heterogeneity, and immune pressure jointly shape signal emergence and persistence. Finally, to model situations in which the observer has access to future information -- such as the terminal biomarker signal or sampling time in retrospective studies -- we adopt an anticipative theoretic perspective. Using anticipative stochastic calculus, we derive path solutions to the resulting anticipating stochastic differential equation, capturing how future observations influence the inferred biomarker dynamics. This approach links the dynamics of underlying tumor-immune interactions to the corresponding detectable biomarker levels, with implications for early detection, immune monitoring, and retrospective reconstruction of disease progression.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

We recently showed that vascular normalization using anti-VEGF therapy can overcome these challenges and improve the outcome of CAR-T therapy in glioblastoma models in mice. Here, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to simulate the dynamics of both adoptively transferred CAR-T cells and endogenous immune cells in solid tumors following vascular normalization. Similar to our data, our model simulations show that vascular normalization reprograms the TME from immunosuppressive to immunosupportive--enhancing infiltration of endogenous CD8+ T cells and CAR-T cells, increasing M1 macrophages, and reducing M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells--thereby improving efficacy. Strikingly, vascular normalization reduces the number of infused CAR-T cells needed for tumor control by an order of magnitude. Moreover, synchronizing a second CAR-T infusion at their peak proliferative phase maximizes antitumor function. Furthermore, the efficacy of CAR-T cells engineered to secrete anti-VEGF antibody depends on the ability of CAR-T cells to induce vascular normalization. Additionally, combining vascular and stromal normalization can improve the efficacy of anti-VEGF antibody-producing FAP-CAR-T cells for the treatment of desmoplastic tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Finally, the model predicts that local CAR-T delivery can sustain high concentrations within the TME and induce recruitment of other antitumor immune cells, improving outcomes.

A new cell type called \"periodic cell\" is integral in sustaining calcium signalling in a glioblastoma network. Periodic cells are rare, can sustain consistent intracellular calcium transients, are likely to have KCa3.1 pumps, and have on average more tumor microtubes than other glioma cells. Here we adapt an ordinary differential equation model for intracellular as well as intercellular calcium signalling and apply it to a large glioma cell network. Using the model, three main hypotheses for the driving mechanism of periodic cells were tested: 1.\\ a fixed and elevated IP$_3$ concentration, 2.\\ added benefit from influx of calcium due to KCa3.1 pumps, or 3.\\ oscillation in calcium influx into the cell through the plasma membrane. All three hypotheses yield similar calcium oscillation patterns resembling the trends seen in the data of Hausmann et al. 2023. In vivo, glioma networks were shown to have small-world and scale free network properties. We apply our model to small-world, scale-free and random networks. For these networks, we test how communication is inhibited through removal of cells, removal of tumor microtubes, and inhibition of KCa3.1 pumps. All three network types were more vulnerable to random cell damage than to random TM damage. We find that inhibition of KCa3.1 pumps can have a significant impact on the inhibition of network communication, however, to fully degrade the calcium signalling network, all periodic cells must be eradicated, confirming experimental observations.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Using annotated proteomes and a birth-death model of gene family evolution, we identified 231 rapidly evolving gene families, enriched in functions related to regulation, information processing, multifunctional domains, and defense and stress responses. Focusing on defense- and stress-related gene families, we assessed CNV within populations of A. thaliana and A. lyrata using long-read assemblies. We identified 29 gene families exhibiting CNV both within and between species. These families showed frequent pseudogenization in roughly two-thirds of cases and functional divergence among paralogs, yet retained signatures of strong purifying selection, highlighting ecological constraint despite structural variation. Population clustering based on CNV patterns revealed distinct geographic structuring. In A. thaliana, populations from Cape Verde, Madeira, and Japan formed divergent clusters, while A. lyrata showed separation between North American, Siberian, and European populations, mirroring patterns observed from SNP data. Ecological modeling further revealed significant associations between CNV and bioclimatic variables, particularly more temperature-derived-variables than precipitation-derived-variables in A. lyrata.

However, such conservation does not necessarily imply that positive selection shaped their evolutionary origins. Here, we test for global signs of positive selection by studying the distribution of secondary structures in naturally occurring noncoding RNA. We find that, to first order, these structures are statistically indistinguishable from those produced by a relatively small set of randomly generated sequences. The distributions are, however, profoundly shaped by a strong bias in the arrival of phenotypic variation, such that only an exponentially small subset of all possible structures is likely to occur in nature. In other words, the secondary structure repertoire of natural noncoding RNAs largely reflects this developmental bias rather than further adaptive fine-tuning. Detecting genuine signatures of selection, beyond randomness, in the distribution of secondary structures, therefore requires careful calibration against appropriate null models that account for the underlying bias. We perform a large-scale and detailed analysis of four extensive datasets covering a wide spectrum of functional RNA classes. We describe one potential signature of adaptation on structure: archaeal ribosomal RNA structures are simpler and more robust than predictions of the sequence null model, and hyperthermophiles are less complex than archaea in other niches, but the effects are relatively small.

These assemblies enabled the creation of a pangenome graph containing comprehensive, nucleotide-resolution maps of SVs, including complex rearrangements such as the interchromosomal inverted duplication Dp(2;4)eyD and large tandem duplications at the Bar locus. We uncovered new candidate causal mutations for 15 phenotypes and new molecular alleles for 2 mutations comprising tandem duplications, transposable element (TE) insertions, and indels.

This study examined whether negative affectivity (such as depressiveness, anxiety, and stress level), conceptualized as both transient states and stable traits, moderates the effects of tDCS on working memory (WM) and associative memory (AM). We pooled data from six sham-controlled experiments involving 144 healthy young adults (351 tDCS sessions) using within-subject crossover designs. Participants completed WM and AM tasks following active anodal tDCS or sham, as well as Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) before each session. We found that trait-level negative affectivity, but not state-level emotional fluctuations, moderated WM. Individuals with higher levels of depression, anxiety, or stress demonstrated greater tDCS-induced WM gains. In contrast, AM benefits were consistent and unaffected by affective traits or states. These findings indicate that psychological traits can shape the variability of tDCS effects. In particular, negative affectivity influences susceptibility to tDCS effects on cognitively demanding tasks that rely heavily on executive control. This effect may stem from negative affectivity's association with downscaled baseline cortical excitability in prefrontal networks, crucial for WM performance, thereby opening the possibility of greater tDCS-induced improvement. These findings provide further support to our growing understanding of the complex interplay between emotional and cognitive processes in shaping individual responses to tDCS and point out that negative affectivity should be taken into consideration when evaluating individual variability of the tDCS (and other non-invasive brain stimulation techniques) effects on memory and cognition.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Hemodynamic parameters (mPAP) and right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) were measured. Pathological changes were assessed via HE staining. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyzed macrophage subsets in lung tissues. Macrophage polarization and NF-{kappa}B pathway activity were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, qPCR, cytokine profiling and Western blot. Results In a severe PAH model induced by left pneumonectomy plus monocrotaline, pulmonary interstitial macrophages initially exhibited a predominant M1-polarized phenotype in the early stage, which transitioned to an M2a-polarized phenotype in the later stage and eventually stabilized. Low-dose PTX alleviated severe PAH by reducing perivascular macrophage infiltration. Cytological studies confirmed that PTX inhibited M2a polarization via suppression of NF-{kappa}B, thereby attenuating its proliferative effects on pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Conclusion M2a macrophages play a crucial role in PAH progression. PTX may alleviate PAH by suppressing M2a polarization via the NF-{kappa}B pathway.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

However, the determinants of disruption of the molecular clock in human cancer are not clear. We hypothesized that derangement in expression of specific circadian clock genes or elevated MYC expression could correlate with circadian disruption in human tumors, and used Clock Correlation Distance (CCD) to compare clock order and strength in tumors based on the expression of these genes. While the expression of individual circadian genes did not consistently correlate with disruption, tumors with the highest expression of MYC or high MYC pathway activation had significantly disrupted rhythms compared to those with lower MYC. Unexpectedly, a subset of tumors with very low levels of MYC, below that found in normal lung, also showed disruption of circadian rhythms, prompting us to explore novel determinants of disruption in these tumors. We found that expression of programs associated with epithelial to mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and TGF-{beta} signaling were enriched in tumors with the lowest MYC expression, and that, surprisingly, those tumors with a mesenchymal expression pattern had more ordered (stronger) rhythms. To directly test this correlation between cell state and rhythms, we exposed lung adenocarcinoma cells to TGF- {beta} to induce EMT. TGF- {beta} induced a quasi-mesenchymal phenotype and caused a significant increase in the amplitude of oscillations in these cells. Together, our data show that MYC expression, pathway activation, and a mesenchymal cell state are both independent determinants of circadian status in lung adenocarcinoma.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Target elucidation is a critical step in antimalarial drug discovery, enabling a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of both existing and novel compounds. This study validates solvent-induced proteome profiling (SPP) as a proteomics-based approach for identifying drug-protein interactions in Plasmodium falciparum. SPP detects shifts in protein stability induced by ligand binding, allowing the identification of drug targets without the need for compound modifications. Here, we successfully generated solvent denaturation curves for the P. falciparum proteome, and demonstrated the utility of SPP with five antimalarial compounds: pyrimethamine, atovaquone, cipargamin, MMV1557817 and OSM-S-106. In addition to measuring each compounds impact across the full denaturation curve, investigating protein levels at individual solvent percentages preserved specific stability changes that would otherwise be masked in pooled analyses performed by integral SPP. This strategy was critical for the identification of the cipargamin target, non-SERCA-type Ca2+-transporting P-ATPase (PfATP4). Notably, we propose live-cell treatment SPP as a novel approach, demonstrating its ability to identify the validated target of pyrimethamine, bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (PfDHFR), with high specificity. We also introduced the novel one-pot mixed-drug SPP, which enables the evaluation of multiple drugs within a single lysate and experimental setup. This alternative method simplifies the experimental workflow and includes positive controls to affirm the performance of the experiment. Overall, this study demonstrates that SPP can be successfully applied in both lysate and live-cell treatment conditions to elucidate drug targets in P. falciparum, as well as providing additional information regarding the mechanisms of drug action, offering insights for the optimisation of existing antimalarials and the development of novel therapies.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Granules are generated during granulopoiesis and impaired granule production or granule protein sorting has been linked to inefficient pathogen clearance resulting in recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. Here, we studied the role of the membrane protein secretory carrier associated membrane protein 3 (SCAMP3) for neutrophil defense functions. We generated Scamp3 knockout (KO) Hoxb8 cells and found that killing of Escherichia coli by Scamp3 KO Hoxb8 cell-derived neutrophils (dHoxb8 cells) was compromised as compared to control dHoxb8 cells in vitro. Mass spectrometric and Western blot analyses revealed a significant reduction of primary, secondary, and tertiary granule proteins in the genetic absence of Scamp3, resulting in a reduced overall granularity of these cells. Accordingly, degranulation was reduced in Scamp3 KO dHoxb8 cells compared to control dHoxb8 cells. Similarly, SCAMP3 deficiency in zebrafish resulted in reduced neutrophil granularity in comparison to wild-type animals. However, neutrophil migration towards sites of E. coli infection was unaffected in scamp3 KO zebrafish larvae. In summary, SCAMP3 represents an important novel player in granule equipment and degranulation, with key functions in neutrophil defense mechanisms during host-pathogen interactions in vitro.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

During neutrophil development, vesicle dynamics need to be fine-tuned and impaired vesicle trafficking has been linked to failure in neutrophil maturation. Here, we characterized the role of VPS18 as a central core component of CORVET & HOPS tethering complexes for neutrophil development. Using CRISPR/Cas9-engineered Hoxb8 cells with heterozygous mutations in Vps18, we found that VPS18 deficiency interfered with neutrophil development due to tethering complex instability. As a result, vesicle dynamics were impaired with a strong increase in LC3-II and p62 levels, indicating autophagosome accumulation and reduced autophagic flux. With transmission electron microscopy, we verified the increase in autophagosomes and also found irregularly shaped vesicular structures in Vps18 mutants. Subsequently, Vps18 mutant neutrophil progenitors underwent premature apoptosis. We described a novel patient with a heterozygous stop-gain mutation in VPS18 suffering from neutropenia and recurrent infections. To verify our findings in the human system, we used human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Upon differentiation into neutrophils, loss of VPS18 resulted in an almost complete absence of iPSC-derived developing neutrophils. Heterozygous VPS18 mutant and patient mutation-harboring iPSCs were characterized by strongly reduced numbers of developing neutrophils. Zebrafish larvae with heterozygous mutations in vps18 were also characterized by significantly reduced neutrophil numbers. This study shows the pivotal impact of VPS18 for adequate vesicle dynamics during neutrophil development which might be relevant in the context of vesicle trafficking during granulopoiesis and congenital neutropenia.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

During brain development, pro-angiogenic genes drive the formation of vascular networks, with their expression tightly regulated in later stages. We found that in adult CNS endothelial cells (ECs), angiogenesis-related genes are epigenetically silenced through histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Conditional deletion of Hdac2 in ECs reactivated pro-angiogenic signaling, including Wnt/{beta}-catenin target genes, leading to functional neovascularization with preserved blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in the adult brain. In contrast, Ezh2 (PRC2 subunit) deletion reduced vessel density and compromised BBB function. Deletion of Hdac2 and Ezh2 immediately after transient ischemic stroke conferred vascular protection by modulating stroke-induced transcriptional programs in CNS ECs. In contrast, delayed deletion, initiated seven days post-stroke, after significant neuronal loss in the infarct region, induced robust revascularization and promoted post-stroke neurogenesis, with differentiation into both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These findings highlight CNS EC HDAC2 as a promising therapeutic target for inducing adult brain angiogenesis, facilitating revascularization, and supporting neuronal regeneration following stroke.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Here, EEG, eye tracking, head kinematics, and driving performance were recorded in a naturalistic driving task while participants solved arithmetic problems presented on a dashboard-mounted display under low and high working-memory (WM) load, mimicking real-world interaction with dashboard media. High WM load resulted in slower reaction times, reduced accuracy, prolonged gaze toward the stimulus, increased corrective head rotations, and compensatory reductions in driving speed. Time-frequency analysis revealed robust alpha power suppression (~8-13 Hz) over occipito-parietal regions scaling with WM load and closely paralleling gaze behavior.

Compared to younger adults, motor performance in older adults engages more brain regions and exhibits elevated neural activity in the motor-related alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) frequency bands of electro-encephalography (EEG) signals. To what extent these functional changes correlate with the quality of motor performance is underexplored. We recorded EEG in 19 young and 19 older adults during unimanual and bimanual visuomotor tasks with different degrees of difficulty. Older participants showed a lower quality of performance than younger adults, especially during asymmetric bimanual tasks. We analyzed source-localized activity in bilateral parietal and (pre-)motor areas to investigate, especially, the hypothesized pivotal role of left premotor cortex (PMCL) activity within the motor network during motor performance. In PMCL, beta activity was indeed significantly affected by age during bimanual performance, while alpha activity was altered in the bilateral (pre-)cuneus. When predicting error of performance via alpha and beta modulations, we found significant associations in bilateral M1 and (pre-)cuneusR during unimanual performance, while in bimanual performance, PMCL and (pre-)cuneusL were also included in the significant association. Our results confirm the importance of PMCL and (pre-)cuneusL for the performance of bimanual tasks, especially when the tasks are challenging. The age-related differences in alpha power in bilateral (pre-)cuneus and their associations with motor performance suggest that altered visuomotor integration has an important contribution to the reduction of the quality of motor performance in older adults.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

DHDDS encodes a subunit of a DHDDS/NUS1 cis-prenyltransferase (cis-PTase), a branch point enzyme of the mevalonate pathway essential for N-linked glycosylation. We describe the first mouse model of this disease, DhddsR37H+/- strain, heterozygous for the human recurrent de novo c.110G>A:p.R37H pathogenic variant. DhddsR37H+/- mice present with seizures, myoclonus and memory deficits associated with reduced density or/and maturity of inhibitory interneurons in the cortex.

Resting-state functional connectivity provides a rich mapping of the brain's network architecture, linking with both underlying structure and task-evoked responses across the whole brain. In this study, we utilized a model based on propagation of task-evoked activations over resting-state functional connectivity networks to identify cortical contributions to localized functional brain activations associated with binocular convergent eye movements. Binocular vision is crucial for daily routine activities, with its impairment leading to significant challenges in daily life. The distributed network-level mechanisms of binocular convergent eye movements remain unknown. Results showed that mapping activity flow over brain connections accurately generated actual brain activations associated with convergent eye movements, which were distinct from those observed during control tasks. The visual and dorsal attention networks dominated the propagation of activations through resting-state connections during convergent eye movements. Submodel analyses further revealed that restricting activity flow to individual networks, such as the visual or dorsal attention systems alone, substantially reduced model accuracy, underscoring the necessity of distributed, whole-brain contributions. In conclusion, highly distributed network pathways are involved in convergent eye movements, with some pathways contributing much more than others, providing important implications for future clinical models of binocular dysfunction.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

A yeast two-hybrid screen for KNL2 interactors identified components of the SUMOylation pathway. However, the role of KNL2 SUMOylation in Arabidopsis has not yet been determined. In this study, we demonstrated that the C-terminal part of KNL2 interacts with SUMO3 and ULP1d, as shown by BiFC and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Bioinformatic and functional analysis identified three SUMOylation and two SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) sites in the C-terminal region of KNL2, which are critical for growth, fertility, and chromosome alignment. Of the three SUMOylation sites, Lys474 and Lys511 were the most critical for the centromeric localization of KNL2, underscoring the importance of KNL2 SUMOylation for its function. Additionally, both in vitro and in vivo assays showed that KNL2-C undergoes SUMOylation by SUMO1 or SUMO3. The SUMO protease mutant, ulp1d-2, led to the slight accumulation of SUMOylated KNL2 in Arabidopsis.

We show these vesicles subsequently fuse to form tubular C-shaped and an unprecedented toroidal membrane intermediates, which ultimately organize into the ciliary vesicle covering the MC distal end. The formation of these previously uncharacterized tubular membrane ciliogenesis intermediates is orchestrated by the membrane trafficking regulators EHD1 and RAB8, and requires the IFT-B complex protein IFT88.

Unlike nuclear lamins, Cilin lacks a nuclear localization signal and instead localizes predominantly to motile ciliary structures, including comb plates, the aboral organ, and sperm flagella, indicating a central role in ciliary architecture and function. Remarkably, Cilin is also present in non-ciliated cells, suggesting early functional diversification of cIFs in animal evolution. Phylogenetic and structural analyses position Cilin within an ancestral class of intermediate filament proteins, homologous to cnidarian and bilaterian nematocilins and lamin-tail-domain-containing (LMNTD) proteins. In humans, LMNTD proteins are enriched in ciliated epithelia and spermatids, pointing to a deeply conserved role in cilia-associated functions.

We show that failure to collect chromosomes into a single mass and establish a bipolar spindle during zygotic metaphase leads to severe multi-nucleation. We find that KIF10/CENP-E kinesin activity is essential to prevent the formation of multiple spindle poles and to congress chromosomes onto a metaphase plate. Furthermore, although the spindle assembly checkpoint mediates a delay in response to a highly disorganised spindle, KIF10/CENP-E-inhibited embryos ultimately undergo the first mitosis with a chaotic anaphase. Therefore, defective chromosome congression in the zygote combined with a failure to sense this error cause multi-nucleation. Remarkably, multi-nucleation can be corrected during the second mitotic division in a KIF10/CENP-E-dependent manner.

Retinoic acid (RA) is a key regulator that exerts concentration-dependent effects on both embryonic and adult hematopoiesis. However, the mechanisms that modulate RA signaling in hematopoietic processes remain poorly understood. Using zebrafish as a model, we identified angiopoietin-like protein 5 (Angptl5) as a critical regulator of hematopoietic homeostasis. Loss of Angptl5 function resulted in myeloid hyperplasia in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) and anterior expansion of erythroid progenitors in the posterior lateral plate mesoderm (PLPM)-phenotypes consistent with attenuated RA signaling. Molecular analyses confirmed impaired RA signaling in angptl5{Delta}10/{Delta}10 mutants, and exogenous RA supplementation fully rescued the hematopoietic defects. Mechanistically, we found that Angptl5 transcriptionally activates retinol dehydrogenase dhrs9 through its interaction with Integrin 6l{beta}5. Our findings establish Angptl5 as a novel and essential regulator of embryonic hematopoiesis and reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism controlling hematopoietic homeostasis. These insights position Angptl5 as a potential therapeutic target for hematological disorders.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "A key explanation for phenotypic plasticity is that changing behaviour to match conditions increases fitness. Affiliative social associations with conspecifics can be important for coping with challenging conditions, and therefore plasticity in social behaviour in response to environment variation may bring fitness benefits. Here we test the adaptive benefit of social plasticity by quantifying female bottlenose dolphins' (Tursiops truncatus) plastic responses to salmon (Salmo salar) abundance and determine if either this plasticity or mean social behaviour is associated with calving success. We found that more gregarious females and those better connected to all parts of the entire social network had higher calving success, but plasticity in social behaviour in response to salmon abundance was not associated with this component of fitness. This lack of relationship may have arisen as salmon abundance in either current or previous years was not associated with the probability of producing a calf. We therefore demonstrate that being more social is positively associated with females' calving success in our study population, but social plasticity itself is not associated with fitness benefits, questioning whether this is likely to be a mechanism for this population of dolphins to cope with challenging environmental conditions.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Ants have more odorant receptor (OR) genes than any other group of insects, generated through tandem duplications that produce large genomic arrays of related genes. However, how olfactory sensory neurons produce a single functional OR from these arrays remains unclear. In ants, only mRNA from one OR in an array is exported into the cytoplasm, while upstream genes are silent and transcripts from downstream genes remain nuclear. Here, we show that non-canonical readthrough transcription in the downstream direction generates non-translated transcripts. We also find that OR promoters are bidirectional, producing antisense long non-coding RNAs that appear to suppress the expression of upstream genes.

To properly develop those cellular boundaries, a tightly controlled interaction of many molecules and pathways is needed. Mutant alleles of paqr-2 and iglr-2(lipid homeostasis), dpy-21 (membrane trafficking), and sma-1 (actin-binding spectrin) result in hermaphrodite tail tip defects suggesting that this simple four-cell structure can serve as a sensitive model for the identification of pathways responsible for the establishment of cellular boundaries. With this in mind, we performed a small forward genetics screen of ~800 ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized haploid genomes and identified 21 mutants with a tail end defective (Ted) phenotype. Whole genome sequencing of these mutants identified mutations in genes encoding either structural constituents of the cuticle itself (mostly collagen genes) or protein with regulatory functions.

Although much is known about how cells migrate through interstitial spaces consisting of predominantly of collagen-rich ECM and mesenchyme, how cells migrate through confined epithelial spaces without impairing barrier function is far less understood. Here, using live imaging of the mouse epidermis, we captured the migration of embryonic melanocytes (melanoblasts) while simultaneously visualizing the basement membrane or epithelial surfaces. We show that melanoblasts migrate through both basal and suprabasal layers of the epidermis and hair follicles where they use keratinocyte surfaces, as well as the basement membrane, as substrates for migration. We show that melanoblasts form atypical and dynamic E-cadherin based attachments to surrounding keratinocytes that largely lack the cytoplasmic catenins known to anchor E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton. We show E-cadherin is needed in both melanoblasts and keratinocytes to stabilize migratory protrusions, and that depleting E-cadherin in melanoblasts results in reduced motility and ventral depigmentation in adult mice.

Myeloablative stress disrupts not only hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells but also essential BM niche components, including endothelial cells (ECs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs); disruption of the latter impairs efficient hematopoietic recovery. However, therapeutic strategies targeting niche restoration remain largely underdeveloped. Here, we demonstrate that the Hippo pathway effectors YAP/TAZ are critical for enabling ECs and MSCs to respond to BM injury, and that YAP/TAZ activation accelerates BM niche recovery, thereby promoting hematopoietic regeneration. We found that YAP/TAZ are rapidly activated in both MSCs and ECs following myeloablative stress, maintaining MSC multipotency and orchestrating vascular remodeling. Mechanistically, YAP/TAZ function as transcriptional hubs in MSCs, regulating key transcriptional factors such as Ebf1 and Ebf3. This regulation preserves MSC identity by preventing osteogenic and fibrogenic differentiation while promoting the expression of hematopoietic factors such as Cxcl12 and angiogenic factors. In parallel, YAP/TAZ signaling in ECs facilitates pro-angiogenic responses and drives sinusoidal vessel remodeling after injury. These YAP/TAZ-mediated niche responses are essential for HSC retention and hematopoietic regeneration following diverse myelosuppressive therapies. Notably, pharmacological activation of YAP/TAZ enhances BM niche reorganization and augments hematopoietic regeneration following myeloablative therapies. These findings establish YAP/TAZ as central regulators of BM niche resilience, providing a rationale for niche-targeted therapeutic strategies to enhance hematopoietic regeneration.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

To investigate this, we here study the onset of optic cup invagination during vertebrate eye development, combining 3D shape analysis, perturbation experiments, and physical modelling inspired by shape-programmable materials. We find that basal invagination is initiated at the apical surfaces through active, patterned cell behaviours. These behaviours generate in-plane strain patterns reshaping the apical surface and thereby bending the tissue basally. Surprisingly, this means that basal shape initiation is driven by apical dynamics. While retinal pigmented epithelium and neuroepithelium exhibit distinct shape transitions, these are temporally coordinated to jointly shape the optic cup. These findings highlight that 3D shape can emerge from local apical activity of two coordinated patterns.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

L.; Laporte, D.; DAIGNAN-FORNIER, B.", "abstract": "Multicellularity is present throughout the entire tree of life. While the formation of simple multicellular entities can result from aggregation of cells or clonal development, it is not yet fully understood how, once formed, these simple multicellular entities could be maintained or even selected for. Here, using the yeast mutant ace2 snowflake as a model of simple multicellularity, we aimed at identifying genetic conditions favoring its maintenance. Growth-competition experiments revealed that, while the ace2 mutation by itself does not provide any advantage or disadvantage, the ace2 snowflakes were strongly selected when combined to conditions affecting regulators of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, such as Cln3 or Whi5. We show that this selection results from a faster exit from stationary phase of the ace2 snowflake. Importantly, this advantage is not dependent on the multicellular phenotype, but rather on the ace2 genotype itself. We found that the ace2 selective advantage in the cln3 background fully depends on the KSS1 gene, another target of the Ace2 transcription factor. Finally, we show that results similar to those obtained with ace2 mutants are phenocopied by the AMN1368D allelic form found in all feral yeast strains, hence bringing a strong physiological relevance to these observations. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that simple multicellularity could persist, not because it provides a direct selective advantage due to multicellularity itself, but rather as a passenger phenotype that is maintained alongside other selected traits. SIGNIFICANCE: While appearance of simple multicellularity does not seem so rare during evolution, what drove its maintenance and kept these simple multicellular entities away from counter-selection long enough for them to evolve sophisticated modes of cooperation such as division of labor, is questioning. A simple type of explanations is that multicellularity by itself could be advantageous, for example by allowing to escape predation or favoring resistance to stresses. Here we show that, alternatively, multicellularity can be selected as a phenotypic passenger of a mutation that is selected for another reason i.e. regulation of cell cycle progression. This initial absence of selective pressure on multicellularity itself may offer favorable conditions for further evolution.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

This phenomenon could be caused by direct antagonistic responses and/or reduced synchronization by not forming a chimeric hyphal network. In other fungi, highly divergent alleles for a set of genes affect successful network formation between individuals either by preventing fusion or, more commonly, triggering cell death post-fusion. To understand this process in A. bisporus, it is important to identify the allelic variants allowing these fungi to discriminate self from nonself. We leverage a recently described cell death staining method utilizing Evans Blue to visualize mycelial compatibility. Here, we provide results of a first genetic mapping of incompatibility alleles in A. bisporus. Crossing strains between A. bisporus var. bisporus and A. bisporus var. burnetti we find segregation ratios of compatible progeny generally consistent with three nuclear loci. To identify these regions, we first use a set of single Chromosome Substitution Lines (CSLs), produced by genotyping progeny with recombination skewed to the very chromosome ends. We localize the main effect to be between two and three chromosomes, depending on the common nucleus of interacting heterokaryons. Using genome-wide markers for 167 sexual progeny, we identify loci controlling mycelial compatibility on chromosomes 4, 6 and 7, the same chromosomes as indicated by chromosome substitution lines. Notably, while the choice of a common nucleus seemed to affect the compatibility of CSLs, it did not seem to affect the loci identified in the sexual progeny. The ability to mix different strains of this mushroom-forming fungus could allow additional cultivation approaches, combining strains with complementary characteristics.

While anti-TNF- monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are effective in maintaining remission in IBD, systemic delivery is associated with immunosuppression, poor targeting efficiency, and high cost. To address these limitations, we developed a synthetic mucin-based hydrogel for localized delivery of TNF--targeting mAbs. Mucins are heavily glycosylated biopolymers that naturally bind antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory proteins, making them well-suited for local biologic drug delivery at mucosal sites. Synthetic mucin-based hydrogels were formed by crosslinking mucin harvested from porcine small intestine with a 4-arm PEG-thiol and loaded with mAbs to evaluate biocompatibility, antibody release kinetics, and therapeutic efficacy. In vitro studies confirmed cytocompatibility of mucin-based hydrogels and demonstrated sustained release of full-length IgG antibodies, with enhanced release under proteolytic conditions simulating the gastrointestinal environment. Moreover, mucin-based hydrogels alone were found to modulate macrophage activation and dampen inflammation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Treatment of LPS-stimulated macrophages with mAb-loaded hydrogels reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and macrophage activation, confirming retention of mAb bioactivity. Compared to antibodies administered in solution, in vivo biodistribution studies revealed greater absorption of antibodies when loaded in mucin-based hydrogels and administered via enema in TNBS-induced colitis mice likely due to enhanced adhesion to mucosal epithelium and slowed intestinal clearance. This study demonstrates the potential of mucin-based hydrogels as a platform for local mAb delivery in IBD, enabling targeted immunosuppression while minimizing systemic exposure.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Here we report that residual cancer persister cells that survive oncogene targeted therapy are growth arrested by drug stress-induced intrinsic Type I interferon (IFN) signaling. To escape growth arrest, persister cells leverage apoptotic machinery to transcriptionally suppress interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mechanistically, persister cells sublethally engage apoptotic caspases to activate DNA endonuclease DNA Fragmentation Factor B (DFFB, also known as Caspase-Activated DNase (CAD)) which induces DNA damage, mutagenesis, and stress response factor Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3). ATF3 limits Activator Protein-1 (AP1)-mediated ISG expression sufficiently to allow persister cell regrowth.

RasGRP3 is uniquely overexpressed and essential for survival in uveal melanoma cells, but dispensable in healthy cells. RasGRP3 remains undruggable due to its intracellular localization and lack of targetable binding pockets. To overcome this, we developed a CRISPR-Cas13d RNA-targeting therapeutic that specifically knocks down RasGRP3 mRNA. This Cas13d-based therapeutic mediates selective uveal melanoma killing through two synergistic mechanisms: (i) direct silencing of the essential RasGRP3 transcript, and (ii) collateral RNA degradation triggered by the cleavage of overexpressed RasGRP3.

Global metrics like minimum free energy and average unpaired probability have improved mRNA stability but fail to capture local structural variation relevant to degradation. We show that base-pairing probability, in terms of log odds, provide fine-scale, orthogonal insight that complements global metrics and improves stability modeling.

While Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) enables precise transcription start site mapping, its high cost and limited coverage hinder scalability. In contrast, RNA-seq is abundant across biological contexts; several algorithms (ProActiv, Salmon, DEXSeq) infer promoter activity from these data, yet no unified, reproducible framework exists to execute, benchmark, and compare them or to scale alternative promoter analyses across large compendia. Results: We developed snakeAltPromoter, an end-to-end Snakemake workflow that ingests raw FASTQ files, performs quality control and alignment, quantifies promoter activity using three complementary strategies (junction-based, transcript-based, and first-exon-based), classifies promoters into major, minor/alternative, and inactive categories, and conducts both differential promoter activity and usage analysis. Crucially, snakeAltPromoter integrates a systematic benchmarking module against matched CAGE profiles to reveal method-specific strengths and limitations. ProActiv showed the highest concordance with CAGE in promoter classification, activity and differential analysis, Salmon was robust at low coverage and intronless cases. Overall, the complete workflow recovered a majority of CAGE-validated active promoters and processed a 50 M-read RNA-seq sample in around 2h on a 32-core node, demonstrating both accuracy and scalability. Conclusions: snakeAltPromoter is, to our knowledge, the first reproducible framework that pairs comparative method evaluation with scalable differential alternative promoter analysis.

This symptom is highly prevalent in patients with chronic and critical illness, and its presence is associated with poor clinical outcomes and long-term psychological trauma. The multidimensional nature of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying dyspnea, paired with individual variation in its presentation, makes identifying and monitoring this symptom difficult, particularly in non-communicative patients. Objective: Undetected and untreated dyspnea in critically ill patients is a significant problem contributing to patient suffering. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of machine learning methods for assessing and continuously monitoring dyspnea using easily obtained noninvasive biomarkers. Methods: We recruited healthy participants (N = 60, 35 women) and stimulated dyspnea using a forced end-tidal semi-rebreathing circuit to modulate arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide levels while collecting non-invasive biomarker data and continuous self-reported dyspnea severity scores. This data was used to train machine-learning models to predict the presence or absence of significant dyspnea (Numeric Rating Scale [&ge;] 3). We then compared the performance of our final model to observational estimates by trained healthcare providers. Measurements and Main Results: The final model (Random Forest) performed well (PR-AUC=0.832) and exceeded the accuracy of observation estimates made on the same participants using the Respiratory Distress Observational Scale (RDOS) (accuracy=54%).

J.; Daou, A.", "abstract": "Temperature fluctuations can have detrimental effects on the firing pattern and electrical activity of biological neurons, eliciting diverse responses depending on the neuronal cell types and the underlying ion channels exhibited. Using the classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, we performed a comprehensive dynamical systems analysis to determine how temperature fluctuations alter neuronal excitability, spike morphology, and bifurcation structure. We first relied on experimentally-derived temperature coefficients, or Q10 values, associated with gating kinetics and conductances, and examined codimension-1 and codimension-2 bifurcations across a range of temperatures and standard HH parameters governing the intrinsic properties (firing frequency, spike amplitude, spike width, afterhyperpolarization (AHP), time-to-peak AHP, etc) of the model HH neuron. Our analysis revealed that increasing temperature accelerates gating dynamics, leading to narrower and higher-frequency spikes but reduced amplitudes, and ultimately to a loss of sustained firing via temperature-induced depolarization block. We identified generalized Hopf (Bautin) bifurcations as critical boundaries beyond which the system becomes strictly monostable. Extending the model to independently scale sodium activation, sodium inactivation, and potassium activation kinetics showed that excitability is particularly sensitive to potassium gating dynamics. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding temperature modulations of neuronal activity, highlighting how temperature reshapes the excitability landscape, unveiling the intricate interplays between the activation/inactivation kinetics of ion channels, and identifying key parameters governing temperature robustness in neuronal models.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

There have been only sporadic reports of resistance in the clinic but testing is rare so the true resistance landscape is unclear. We have previously shown that resistance can emerge rapidly in vitro via distinct but complementary pathways. Strain Bc2, characterised here, is an experimentally evolved derivative of C. difficile strain R20291 that displays a 16-fold increase in vancomycin MIC over its parent. Bc2 has point mutations in dacS, bclA3, CDR20291_0794, CDR20291_1871 and CDR20291_3124 (vnrS). By genetically engineering a wild-type vancomycin susceptible strain, we demonstrated that a combination of just two mutations, dacSc.798A>T and vnrSc.692G>T, both of which encode two-component system histidine kinases, was sufficient to recapitulate Bc2 resistance. We have previously shown that mutations in dacS can confer low level resistance via increases in the expression of a D,D-carboxypeptidase DacJ. dacSc.798A>T also led to increased transcription of dacJ and led to a modest increase in vancomycin MIC. Surprisingly vnrSc.692G>T led to overexpression of the vanG cluster, which encodes all of the enzymes needed for resistance via substitution of the terminal D-Ala on peptidoglycan lipid II precursors with D-Ser. Genomic analysis of a large collection of European C. difficile strains showed that a three gene cluster, which includes vnrS, vnrR (encoding the cognate response regulator) and an adjacent gene CDR20291_3123, is unique to the phylogenetic branch that contains strains belonging to epidemic ribotypes 027 and 176. Transcriptomic analysis of the wider VnrS regulon also revealed an additional previously unknown role in regulating the expression of the flagellum, an important virulence factor in C. difficile. Analysis of the response to vancomycin exposure also revealed that dacJ is one of a small set of genes that are upregulated shortly after antibiotic stress, even in the absence of mutations that typically lead to its overexpression. Together these data reveal a new synergistic route, needing only two point mutations, by which epidemic lineages of C. difficile can attain vancomycin resistance.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Engineering non-nitrogen-fixing organisms, like plants, to use nitrogenase could reduce dependency on synthetic fertilizer and mitigate the environmental impacts of industrial fertilizer production. However, nitrogenase activity requires delivery of reducing power by small electron carrying proteins known as ferredoxins and flavodoxins, and successfully engineering nitrogenase into new systems will require a mechanistic understanding of electron delivery by these proteins. Most organisms often have multiple ferredoxins, raising the question of which ferredoxin can support nitrogenase activity. The purpose of this study is to gain insight into how we can predict which ferredoxin is compatible with the Fe protein, the component of nitrogenase that interacts with ferredoxin or flavodoxin. Our in silico protein-protein docking simulations reveal that ferredoxins and flavodoxins involved in nitrogen fixation have a distance [&le;] 10 [A] between their redox cofactor and the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the Fe protein. We found shorter cofactor distance contributes to faster intermolecular electron tunneling rates (> 10 6 sec -1).

Heterologous expression of a set of ferredoxins from both nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the diazotroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris support our model-derived prediction that cofactor distances of [&le;]10 [A] favor nitrogenase compatibility.

Additionally, a 1:1 diluted soil was prepared (12,600 mg/kg TPH), and with the field contaminated soil, used to investigate the effects on rhizobacterial community composition. In two-year greenhouse experiments (2023 - 2025), the soils were planted with native or naturalized plant species and inoculated with i) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), ii) the biosurfactant-producing and plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) - Bacillus subtilis ATCC 21332, or iii) both AMF and B. subtilis 21332. PHC contamination was determined to exert a dominant influence on rhizobacterial community composition. Alpha- and beta-diversity analyses revealed that neither plant species nor microbial inoculants significantly altered bacterial diversity or community structure beyond the overriding effect of PHC concentration. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, Acidobacteriota, and Chloroflexi dominated across all soils, with hydrocarbon-degrading genera such as KCM-B 112 and Sphingomonas significantly enriched in the 25,700 mg/kg TPH soil.

K.", "abstract": "Adverse anthropogenic impacts on the Biosphere have produced environmental change at a rate unprecedented in the Cenozoic, shifting the environmental conditions outside of the physiological tolerance range of many species. Predicting the patterns of species response to climate change requires tracking the variation in fitness-related traits (i.e. life histories) during exposure to thermally changing environments, because these traits may strongly correlate with the probability of survival. A growing body of experimental studies demonstrated that an increase of mean temperatures significantly influences the response of several life history traits, namely reduction of development time and body size at maturation. However, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how species respond to temperature change, as most research has focused only on abrupt changes to thermal conditions. To better reflect ecological reality, we need experimental designs that examine the effects of gradually and continuously changing thermal environments over longer time scales, because the population genetics of adaptation to stressful environments is strongly influenced by the rate of environmental change. Moreover, the extent to which these trait changes result from phenotypic plasticity versus genetic adaptation remains poorly understood. To address these gaps, we conducted a controlled multigenerational evolutionary experiment with a plankton crustacean, Daphnia magna. We subjected the clonal populations to gradually increasing temperatures, a scenario more representative of ongoing climate change than abrupt thermal shifts. We monitored their lifespan, fecundity, somatic growth rate, age at maturation, body size, and extinction risk across generations, and used a reciprocal transplant experiment to disentangle genetic adaptation from phenotypic plasticity. Our results revealed the two distinctive patterns of the response in life history traits under elevated temperatures. The adaptive response was manifested through an increase in fecundity of high-temperature populations relative to control populations. We interpret reduction in both their development time and mean adult body size as the maladaptive responses, given the positive correlations found between adult body size and fecundity, and between development time and adult body size. However, we detected significant level of adaptive plasticity in our populations, as some clonal lines exhibited a markedly different response to elevated temperatures, opposite the population-level trend (increased development time under high temperature, leading to larger adult size and ultimately higher fecundity). This suggests a strong genotype-by-environment interaction (G X E), where genetic variation shapes the plastic response to environmental stress. The presence of such adaptive variants amidst a generally maladaptive mean response underscores the importance of intra-population variation in plasticity. This highlights the need to consider not only average plastic responses but also the distribution and evolutionary potential of genotype-specific trajectories in the face of climate change.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

When flying alone and during aerial displays with conspecifics, Chimney Swifts (Chaetura pelagic) often utter a twitter call consisting of a series of high-frequency chip notes. However, little is known about the possible function(s) of swift flight displays and their twitter call. Our objectives were to record, analyze, and document the aerial behaviors and associated vocalizations of adult Chimney Swifts. We studied in Madison County, Kentucky, where they used abandoned, concrete shelters for roosting and nesting. Camcorders were used to record swift behavior and vocalizations during the 2008 and 2009 breeding seasons (April through September). We examined possible variation in the characteristics of swift vocalizations and the frequency of different aerial behaviors among breeding stages and behavioral contexts. Chimney Swifts engaged in more interactive pair flights during the nest-building/egg-laying stage, when females are likely fertile, and significantly more than during the pre-building and nestling stages, suggesting the possible importance of pair flights in courtship, pair bonding, and mate-guarding. Our results also suggest that V_ing (a raised wing display) may be important in establishing or maintaining pair bonds because swifts engaged in this behavior more frequently during close chases involving two birds. We separated the typical swift twitter into two bouts: steady bouts and quick bouts. Mean chip rates were higher for the quick portion of the call, but we found no differences in the use of steady and quick bouts among nesting stages or in different behavioral contexts. Mean chip rates for quick bouts were highest for single birds and lowest for two and three birds, suggesting that twitter calls provide information about a birds location; to help coordinate movements while flying near others (e.g. when foraging and during chases), We were unable to identify individual swifts; such identification would facilitate the investigation of individual variation in call characteristics (e.g. chip rate and steady/quick bout rate) and relationships between and among swifts engaging in different activities and flight displays.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated two such LarAHs and solved their cryo-electron microscopic structures with and without loaded NPN cofactor, respectively. The structures revealed a consistent octameric assembly that is unprecedented in the LarA family and unveiled a new set of active site residues that likely recognize and process substrates differently from those of the well-studied LarAHs.

The purpose of this study was to compare knee and hip joint kinematics and kinetics, and hamstrings muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length and velocity during the flight phase of sprinting and the NHE. Methods: We collected motion capture and force data from fourteen young athletic participants (8 males and 6 females) as they ran at a range of speeds (4-8 m/s) and performed the NHE. We used this experimental data and a musculoskeletal model to compute joint angles, moments, work, and power and to estimate the hamstrings MTU length and velocity for all running speeds and the NHE. Results: The peak knee flexion moment at running speeds of 6 m/s and above was greater than for the NHE (p < 0.001). Peak negative knee flexion power at all running speeds was higher than during the NHE (p < 0.001). Negative knee flexion work at running speeds of 6 m/s and slower was less than during the NHE (p < 0.001). Peak hamstrings length and lengthening velocity were greater (p < 0.001) for all running speeds compared to the NHE. Conclusion: Sprinting puts the hamstrings at longer hamstrings lengths and higher hamstrings lengthening velocities than the NHE. The NHE requires participants to generate peak knee flexion moments that are smaller than the peak knee flexion moments generated during top speed sprinting and peak negative knee flexion powers that are less than 5% of sprinting. However, the duration of each NHE repetition is approximately 60 times longer than the hamstrings lengthening portion of the flight phase of running, resulting in comparable negative knee work. The results of this study provide necessary quantitative information to compare the biomechanical demands of sprinting and the NHE.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

L.; Zheng, W.; Kerstein, P. C.", "abstract": "Chronic exposure to lead (Pb) is known to cause deficits in neuronal function across the nervous system, including the visual nervous system. Visual deficits have been observed in both humans and rodent models following Pb exposure. However, how Pb exposure causes visual deficits is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Pb toxicity on the retina and optic nerve of the mouse visual nervous system. We used C57BL/6 adult mice of both sexes and divided them into one of three different exposure groups. Adult mice received daily oral gavage of 108mg/kg Na-acetate (control), 54mg/kg Pb-acetate (low dose), or 108mg/kg Pb-acetate (high dose) for 4 weeks. At the end of Pb exposure, whole blood, retina, and optic nerve samples were collected for Pb quantification by atomic absorption spectroscopy and tissue immunohistochemical analyses. Cell type specific markers were used to quantify changes in cell density of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), oligodendrocytes (OLs), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and myelin structure. Following Pb exposure, we observed a small, but significant reduction in the cell density of RGCs in the retina. However, we found no significant changes in branch thickness or coverage of retinal vasculature following Pb exposure. In the optic nerve after Pb exposure, we found a significant reduction in the cell density of OLs and OPCs. Finally, using immunolabeling for Caspr and Nav1.6, we observed significant structural changes in nodes of Ranvier, suggesting a disruption in myelin structure. Our findings suggested that Pb toxicity may impair survival and maturation process of oligodendrocytes, changes in myelin structures, and potential demyelination of the optic nerve.

Here, we show that C. elegans grown on two Escherichia coli strains exhibit different survival dynamics. Wild-type C. elegans on the B type OP50 exhibit more early deaths compared to C. elegans on K-12 type CS180. These early deaths on OP50 are characterized by swollen pharynges (P-deaths) due to bacterial accumulation within the tissue. In contrast, animals on CS180 are more resistant to P-deaths. These bacteria-dependent differences in P-deaths depend on bacterial lipopolysaccharide structures and the activities of the C. elegans neuropeptide neuromedin U receptor nmur-1, which reduces P-deaths on OP50, but not on CS180. Surprisingly, however, nmur-1 promotes the opposite response when the insulin receptor DAF-2 has decreased activity -- where nmur-1 now stimulates P-deaths on OP50, but again with no effect on CS180. We also find that nmur-1 acts in sensory neurons to promote its bi-directional effects on longevity, which depend on the FOXO transcription factor daf-16. nmur-1 regulates the expression of the insulin-like peptide daf-28, which further suggests a regulatory mechanism that maintains insulin receptor DAF-2 signaling at a suitable level. Thus, our studies reveal that nmur-1 serves to buffer the dynamic range of DAF-2 signaling, thereby optimizing pharyngeal health and survival in response to specific bacteria.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Despite advancements in AI-driven neuroimaging analysis for AD detection, clinical deployment remains limited due to challenges in model interpretability and usability. Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks such as XRAI offer potential to bridge this gap by providing clinically meaningful visualizations of model decision-making. Methods: This study developed a comprehensive, clinically deployable AI system for AD severity classification using 2D brain MRI data. Three deep learning architectures MobileNet-V3 Large, EfficientNet-B4, and ResNet-50 were trained on an augmented Kaggle dataset (33,984 images across four AD severity classes). The models were evaluated on both augmented and original datasets, with integrated XRAI explainability providing region-based attribution maps. A web-based clinical interface was built using Gradio to deliver real-time predictions and visual explanations. Results: MobileNet-V3 achieved the highest accuracy (99.18% on the augmented test set; 99.47% on the original dataset), while using the fewest parameters (4.2M), confirming its efficiency and suitability for clinical use. XRAI visualizations aligned with known neuroanatomical patterns of AD progression, enhancing clinical interpretability. The web interface delivered sub-20 second inference with high classification confidence across all AD severity levels, successfully supporting real-world diagnostic workflows. Conclusion: This research presents the first systematic integration of XRAI into AD severity classification using MRI and deep learning. The MobileNet-V3-based system offers high accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability through a user-friendly clinical interface.

T.", "abstract": "Coordinated movement along the body axis is critical to locomotion. In segmented, limbless animals, anterior (head) and posterior (tail) segments play different roles in locomotion, leading to a need for flexible coordination across body regions. Larval Drosophila melanogaster present a tractable experimental model for limbless, segmented crawling given the extensive genetic tools available and the optical clarity of the body. Prior work has suggested that, during crawling, all larval body segments contract similarly, despite the fact that each crawl cycle comprises two overlapping phases: an piston involving the most posterior segments, and a peristaltic wave involving all body segments. To test whether coordination varies regionally during locomotion, we expressed GCaMP in all body wall muscles, and recorded segmental contraction kinematics and muscle recruitment during many cycles of locomotion in linear channels. Facilitated by machine vision techniques, we discovered new features of larval crawling at multiple scales. First, the propagation of both contraction and recruitment waves slowed approaching mid-body segments, then sped up towards the head. Second, the timing relationship between contraction and recruitment waves could be highly variable in anterior segments. Third, contraction durations showed particularly strong intersegmental correlations among posterior segments. These data suggest posterior segments coordinately power the piston phase while anterior segments tolerate greater flexibility to enable reorienting behaviors. Our results depict an unanticipated degree of axial heterogeneity in the coordination of limbless crawling, opening new avenues to study the origins of whole body coordination and the consequences of segmental diversity for locomotion.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Only Hex-C and Pyk knock-down (KD) altered period, lengthening and shortening rhythms, respectively. Notably, Pyk KD induced period shortening persisted in adult-specific KD (AKD), indicating a role independent of developmental effects. Pyk AKD reduced both PERIOD and Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) protein levels, with PDF loss driving the short-period phenotype. Mechanistically, the transcriptional co-regulator TARANIS (TARA) was required: Pyk AKD lowered tara expression, while tara overexpression rescued PDF and circadian period.

This is primarily due to the difficulty in measuring perceptual responses in animal models, where neural recordings are more accessible. In this study, we use mouse olfaction as a model system to develop a framework for measuring perceived odor intensity. We begin by employing a two-odor concentration classification task to demonstrate that both mice and humans assess stimulus amplitude using a common perceptual scale. We then show that this scale corresponds to intensity. Finally, we apply this method to determine iso-intense concentrations of different odorants in mice. Our approach offers a powerful tool for testing hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying perceived odor intensity, potentially enhancing our understanding of olfactory processing and its neural substrates.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Conditional depletion of Wag31 results in viable but coccoid-shaped cells, showing that Wag31 is essential for rod shape maintenance. Our structural phylogenetic analyses of DivIVA homologues revealed that in Actinobacteria, unlike Firmicutes, an intrinsically disordered region spatially separates the N-terminal lipid-binding domain (LBD) from the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (CCD). We show that the LBD is necessary and sufficient for septum localization, independent of its membrane-binding properties, while the CCD domain mediates self-interaction and polar accumulation. Our findings suggest that Wag31 is recruited specifically to the septum through protein-protein interactions, priming the future pole and allowing for a timely divisome-elongasome transition at cytokinesis.

Through the use of MHC II knockout mice, we demonstrate that CD4 T cell help is essential for PZA efficacy.

However, previous research indicates that only about 5% of therapeutic interventions tested in animal models eventually receive regulatory approval for human use, highlighting limitations. The discovery of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Yamanaka's team in 2007 has revolutionized the field with remarkable possibilities for modeling human diseases, drug testing, and regenerative medicine. Differentiated cells derived from iPSCs in two-dimensional (2D) monolayers offer a relatively straightforward system to study disease pathogenesis and underlying molecular mechanisms. Objective: The present study aimed to generate and characterize an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line from peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) of a healthy individual intending to serve as an age and gender-matched control for future disease modeling and regenerative medicine research. Materials and Methods: PBMCs were isolated from a healthy 31-year-old male volunteer. Somatic reprogramming was performed using episomal vectors expressing OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and L-MYC. The resulting colonies were cultured and characterized for pluripotency markers by immunocytochemistry demonstrating the ability to differentiate into three germ layers. Karyotype analysis was performed to check the chromosomal abnormalities. Inferences: The resulting iPSC line exhibited pluripotency markers with the differentiation ability into three germ layers. Karyotyping analysis confirmed a normal chromosomal profile in both the donor and the reprogrammed iPSC line.

Understanding these mechanisms could help explain individual variability in reward processing relevant to substance use vulnerability. Methods: We assessed reward sensitivity in dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) knockout (KO) rats using both home cage (two-bottle choice for sucrose and ethanol) and operant paradigms (Pavlovian and instrumental learning). Results: DAT KO rats showed lower sucrose preference (-27% for 2%, -13% for 4%) and intake (-42% for 4%), diminished Pavlovian responding for sucrose (-68%), and slower acquisition of sucrose-taking behavior (~+30 days) compared to WT rats. DAT KO rats also showed reduced ethanol preference in the home cage (-16%) despite an unchanged intake. Furthermore, operant performed was markedly reduced operant performance after the sucrose-to-ethanol transition (-83%), with no increase in ethanol-taking following sucrose exposure (0% change), unlike WT controls (+41%). SERT KO rats presented reduced sucrose preference (-5%) and intake (-46%) for the 4% solution only. In addition, SERT KO rats also showed reduced Pavlovian sucrose responding (-28%) and slower acquisition of sucrose-taking (~+30 days) but intact responding and learning for ethanol. In the home cage, they displayed lower ethanol preference (-35%) without significant change in operant ethanol performance. A modest overall increase in ethanol-taking was seen post-sucrose in both SERT KO and WT, but without genotype-specific effects. Conclusion and Implications: DAT deletion broadly impaired sensitivity for both natural sucrose and ethanol rewards, particularly under effortful or devalued conditions. In contrast, SERT deletion produced more selective impairments by disrupting sucrose operant responding and moderately reducing ethanol reward preference.

J.; Gharaei, S.", "abstract": "The capacity of animals to rapidly and appropriately respond to potential threats is critical for survival. In many species, this involves innate defensive behaviours, such as escape or freezing. But not all threats are dangerous. Habituation - a form of non-associative learning - allows animals to filter out irrelevant stimuli and thereby avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. While it is well known that context can influence behavioural responses to associative learning, whether non-associative forms of learning, such as habituation, are also context-dependent is unclear. Here, we address this issue in mice by examining the role of environmental context on habituation of defensive behaviours to threatening visual stimuli. We first developed a protocol leading to rapid (within minutes) and stable (at least one week) habituation of freezing responses to slowly sweeping visual stimuli, resembling an aerial predator moving across the sky. Using this protocol, we tested the impact of environmental context on habituation of freezing responses, finding that changing the environmental context led to a significant and reversible reduction in habituation. In summary, we find that environmental context plays a critical role in determining the impact of habituation on visually evoked innate defensive behaviours. These findings reveal a previously unrecognised flexibility in defensive responses to visual threats, extending the influence of environmental context to non-associative learning.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

For years, CFE systems were completed with commercially available tRNA isolated from E. coli MRE600. All commercial sources of tRNA have since been discontinued, jeopardizing future work in all applications of cell-free translation. Here, we address this need by repurposing previously described tRNA isolation methods to produce tRNAs suitable for CFE applications. We isolated the tRNA pools of E. coli strains A19, BL21(DE3), and Rosetta2 BL21(DE3), finding A19 tRNAs but not BL21(DE3) or Rosetta2 BL21(DE3) capable of robust in vitro translation. We determined the abundances of individual tRNAs using tRNA-seq, finding BL21(DE3) and Rosetta2 BL21(DE3) contained outsized abundances of several tRNAs, compromising translation activity. Using codon optimization strategies which align codon usage to tRNA abundance, we were able to mitigate the impact of misaligned tRNA abundances. We extended these studies to V. natriegens, a promising platform for synthetic biology and CFE.

Here, we implement a hybrid optimization framework integrating a Taguchi orthogonal array (OA) design with statistical modeling and machine learning (ML)-based interpretability, using doxorubicin-loaded chitosan microspheres (DOX-CS MSs). Microspheres were synthesized via a water-in-oil emulsion crosslinking method and characterized by FTIR, XRD, and FESEM to confirm chemical structure, crystallinity, and spherical morphology. The optimization targeted a particle size of 5-7 m and encapsulation efficiency (EE) >90%. An initial L9 Taguchi OA design efficiently narrowed the formulation space by varying chitosan concentration (1-3% w/v), glutaraldehyde concentration (1.5-5% v/v), and crosslinking time (3-5 h), yielding nine core formulations. Pearson/Spearman correlation, second-order polynomial regression (Poly^2), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) models quantified parameter influences and predicted performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identified chitosan concentration as the primary determinant of both size and EE, with glutaraldehyde content exerting secondary, synergistic effects. Poly^2 response-surface modeling achieved high predictive accuracy (R^2 = 0.983 for size; R^2 = 0.986 for EE) and yielded explicit regression equations for real-time formulation targeting. This hybrid Taguchi-ML approach enables rapid factor prioritization, reveals nonlinear interactions overlooked by conventional Taguchi analysis, and offers transparent ML interpretability. Beyond chitosan-based carriers, it provides a generalizable, scalable route to rational formulation design in complex particulate systems for targeted biomedical applications.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Our ability to cure widespread infectious diseases is being threatened by the emergence of new resistance mechanisms. Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most prevalent nosocomial Gram-negative bacteria in the world. NDM-1 is a brand-new class of metallo -{beta}- lactamase (MBL) that makes the bacteria almost total resistant to all {beta}-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. Dangerous infections could develop if NDM-1 switches to a bacterium that is already resistant to antibiotics. It could be untreatable and spread quickly among humans. Using the available insilico tools, in the present research work, an attempt has been made to develop inhibitors for NDM-1 {beta} Lactamase of K. pneumoniae. In the present study, 8 standard ligands were identified and docked against the NDM-1 protein using PyRx. Among these standards, Sulfonamide was selected as the best compound and virtual screening of a large number of sulfonamide moieties was conducted with the identified active site in NDM-1 protein using PyRx. On analyzing the obtained results, about 60 molecules were selected as best hits for Docking studies and ADMET studies. On analyzing the ADMET properties and binding energies of the top hits, (3Z)-N-hydroxypenta-1,3-diene-2-sulfonamide (Pubchem CID 118156306) and N-hydroxyfuran-2-sulfonamide (Pubchem CID 46175386).

Despite the identification of numerous neural substrates regulating feeding behavior, the central neural substrate that linked energy-sensing and taste sensation remained elusive. Here, we identified a novel neural circuitry that could directly sense internal energy state and modulate sweet sensation in the Drosophila brain. Specifically, a subset of neuropeptidergic neurons expressing hugin directly detected elevated levels of circulating glucose via glucose transporter Glut1 and ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Upon activation, these neurons released hugin peptide and activated downstream Allatostatin A (AstA)+ neurons via its cognate receptor PK2-R1. Subsequently, the activation of AstA+ neurons then directly inhibited sweet sensation via AstA peptide and its cognate receptor AstA-R1 expressed in sweet-sensing Gr5a+ neurons. We also showed that neuromedin U (NMU), the mammalian homolog of fly hugin, served as an energy sensor to suppress sweet sensation. Therefore, these data identify hugin+ neuron as a central energy sensor responsible for regulating sweet sensation across species.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Background: Over fifty million people worldwide currently live with neurodegenerative diseases, many of which are the result of pathogenic gene variants. Genetically malleable model organisms provide an avenue for research into the genetic bases of these diseases, and the large motor neurons of fruit fly larvae provide a test bed for investigating neuronal mechanisms impacted by pathogenic gene variants. However, it is challenging to collect information from these neurons under physiological conditions as they terminate on muscle fibers that are perpetually contracting - driven by motor neuron burst-firing. New Method: As a test of in vivo neuronal performance, we expressed light-activated opsins in motor-neurons of unrestrained intact Drosophila larva and used light pulses to drive cyclical body-wall contractions that were captured on camera and analyzed offline. Results: We describe the assembly of an apparatus to systematically activate motor-neurons in Drosophila larvae and an image acquisition system to capture the resulting body-wall contractions. To test the utility of the assay we performed a motor-neuron specific knock-down of dMiro, an adaptor for mitochondrial transport into motor-neuron terminals. As predicted, contractions were poorly sustained in larvae with impaired axonal transport of mitochondria. Comparison with Existing Methods: This in vivo assay allows for a test of sustained neuronal performance while sidestepping the shortcomings of electrophysiological assays of neurotransmission in situ where hemolymph-like solutions may not recapitulate hemolymph properties, axons are severed and where recordings are mechanically disrupted at endogenous firing rates. Secondly, unlike adult climbing assays and larval locomotion assays, performance is assayed independently of the organism's motivation to perform or ability to detect stimuli. Conclusions: We demonstrated that Drosophila 3rd instar larvae cannot sustain body-wall contractions if mitochondria are not delivered to motor nerve terminals - validating a motor neuron performance assay in a model organism suited for molecular genetic analysis.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we use a combination of opto- and electro-physiology to explore how the tdc2+ adrenergic-like system modulates competition amongst central pattern generating (CPG) networks controlling locomotion in Drosophila larvae. Bath application of octopamine (OA) promoted fictive forwards locomotion, suppressed backwards locomotion, and induced bouts of fictive head sweeps during wash period that were proportional to the promotion of forward waves. In contrast, tyramine (TA), the conceptualised inhibitory antagonist to OA, promoted collisions and overlap of motor programmes, activity-dependent inhibition, and bouts of silence during wash periods. Dual-colour calcium imaging of the tdc2+ system with motor neurons revealed that the tdc2+ neurons are recruited phasically prior to a majority of fictive locomotor behaviours. Optogenetic manipulation of the tdc2+ system recapitulated a subset of effects and further revealed that activity in tdc2+ system neurons necessary and sufficient for locomotor CPG activity in the system.

However, like with humans, the mouse bladder urine above the urinary sphincter has generally been assumed to be sterile. Yet, given the presence of urobiomes in other mammals and the emerging role of the human urobiome in the defense of the urinary bladder and upper urinary tract, the existence of a mouse urobiome should be critically examined as indigenous microbiota may influence experimental results.

Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based therapies aim to restore the open reading frame and produce a truncated but functional dystrophin protein. Although several ASOs are FDA-approved, dystrophin restoration in patient biopsies remains low, underlining the need to improve ASO efficacy. One major limitation is poor ASO biodistribution to skeletal muscle, influenced by both ASO chemistry and pathological features of dystrophic tissue. In DMD patients and mdx mice, microvascular abnormalities and impaired angiogenesis likely restrict ASO delivery. Here, we hypothesized that enhancing muscle vascularization could improve ASO biodistribution and therapeutic outcomes. Mdx mice were treated with a pro-angiogenic treatment prior to ASO administration targeting exon 23 of dystrophin pre-mRNA. Angiogenic stimulation increased capillary density and improved ASO delivery, exon skipping, and dystrophin expression compared to ASO alone. These molecular improvements were associated with increased myofiber size, larger mean cross-sectional area, and decreased serum myomesin levels, without signs of toxicity.

Tom70 is a mitochondrial surface receptor which recognizes precursors and serves as an interface between mitochondrial protein import and the cytosolic proteostasis network. Mitochondrial import defects trigger a complex stress response, in which compromised protein synthesis rates are a characteristic element. The molecular interplay that connects mitochondrial (dys)function to cytosolic translation rates in yeast cells is however poorly understood. Here, we show that the deletion of the two Tom70 paralogs of yeast (TOM70 and TOM71) leads to defects in mitochondrial biogenesis and slow cell growth. Surprisingly, upon heat stress, the deletion of ZUO1, a chaperone of the ribosome-associated complex (RAC), largely prevented the slow growth and the reduced translation rates in the tom70{Delta}/tom71{Delta} double deletion mutant. In contrast, the mitochondrial defects were not cured but even enhanced by ZUO1 deletion. Our study shows that Zuo1 is a critical component in the signaling pathway that mutes protein synthesis upon mitochondrial dysfunction.

A.; Figueirido, B.; Jones, K. E.", "abstract": "Understanding the ecological adaptations of extinct species is a central goal in vertebrate palaeontology, but is often limited by the incomplete nature of the fossil record. While skulls and limb bones have traditionally been emphasized in functional and ecological reconstructions, vertebrae are frequently overlooked. While isolated vertebrae are among the most commonly preserved postcranial elements, they are rarely found as complete vertebral columns, raising the question of whether isolated elements alone can yield meaningful ecological information. In this study, we assess the potential of vertebral morphology to predict two key ecological traits, running speed and hunting mode, using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics across ten presacral vertebrae from a broad sample of extant carnivorans. We evaluate the predictive power of individual vertebrae, regional groupings (cervical, thoracic, lumbar), and multi-element combinations. Our results show that certain vertebrae retain strong ecological signals on their own, especially the first thoracic and lumbar elements. However, combining multiple vertebrae often dilutes ecological signal, likely due to their differing functional roles along the axial column. This highlights the importance of treating vertebral regions independently and suggests that single, strategically informative vertebrae may outperform multi-element approaches in some contexts. We apply this framework to the extinct dire wolf (Canis dirus) and find contrasting signals along the spine, the first thoracic and lumbar vertebrae suggest adaptations for faster locomotion, while some cervical vertebrae indicate an intermediate running speed. This mosaic supports the idea that C. dirus occupied a complex ecological niche involving both active predation and scavenging. These findings underscore the power of vertebral morphology for ecological inference in fossil taxa, particularly when remains are fragmentary, and argue for a more nuanced use of isolated axial elements in reconstructing extinct carnivoran behaviour.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

We presented participants with continuous auditory verbal and non-verbal narratives to memorise. Participants rated the perceived coherence of each narrative to provide a subjective measure of semantic elaboration. We assessed memory of the narratives depending on semantic elaboration and modality of encoding with a subsequent retrieval test. We recorded their electroencephalogram (EEG) to establish how semantic elaboration modulated the representation of narrative information proxied by neocortical alpha-beta oscillations during the encoding and retrieval. First, we found that semantic elaboration facilitated narrative information processing by speeding perceived coherence responses during encoding. Second, the magnitude of alpha-beta desynchronisation across the semantic network progressively increased with the chronological position of the events indexing information accumulation as the narratives unfolded. Third, the coherence scores of the narratives negatively correlated with the magnitude of alpha-beta oscillation desynchronisation later during successful retrieval.

Thirty patients with implanted hybrid depth electrodes performed a WM task with images as memoranda. Electrical stimulation (2 s, 50 Hz, 1 mA) was delivered to the hippocampus during the maintenance period on a subset of trials. Behaviorally, stimulation impaired WM performance, reducing accuracy and increasing response times. Neuronally, stimulation reduced memoranda-selective persistent activity in hippocampus and ventral temporal cortex (VTC), thereby disrupting content-specific neural representations. The extent of neural disruption was correlated trial-by-trial with impaired WM-related behavior, establishing a causal link between disrupted neural activity and impaired WM. At the population level, stimulation shifted neural trajectories farther from attractor states, consistent with degraded mnemonic fidelity. Together, these data provide causal evidence that persistent activity of individual neurons in hippocampus and VTC supports WM maintenance in humans. Our results demonstrate that perturbing hippocampal dynamics disrupts both single-neuron coding and population-level attractor stability, linking cellular mechanisms to behavior and highlighting hippocampal contributions to WM maintenance.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Individual differences in the ability to make such rhythmic and melodic predictions shape music perception. Previous studies show that during rhythmic auditory-motor synchronization tasks, better performance is related to stronger motor system engagement. However, whether individual differences in auditory-motor interactions influence higher-level rhythmic predictions is unknown. Here, we used electroencephalography during a naturalistic music listening task to assess the neural tracking of rhythmic and melodic predictions generated from (short-term) local contextual information and (long-term) experience using the Information Dynamics of Music model. We combined a multivariate temporal response function approach with two behavioral measures of auditory-motor synchronization (whispering and finger tapping). We found that stronger auditory-motor synchronization predicted stronger neural tracking of lower-level temporal aspects of the music signal, i.e. acoustic envelope and note onset. Across participants, higher-level (short- and long-term) predictions were also neurally tracked, with neural tracking stronger for rhythmic than melodic predictions. Importantly, our evidence suggests individual differences in the weighting of musical predictions. Individuals with stronger auditory-motor synchronization showed stronger neural tracking of rhythmic compared to melodic predictions, and this effect was especially pronounced for short-term predictions. Our findings demonstrate that the motor system is critically involved at several processing levels even in purely perceptual music tasks, and pave the way for understanding individual differences in the weighting of rhythmic and melodic predictions during music listening.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

Using RNAseq we have characterized the distinctive molecular fingerprint of 4 SVZ neural progenitors and compared their gene expression profiles to those of the NSCs. Overall, we identified 1581 genes that were upregulated in at least one NP compared to the NSCs. Of these genes, 796 genes were upregulated in BNAP/GRP1 compared to NSCs; 653 in GRP2/MP3; 440 in GRP3; 527 in PFMPs. One gene in particular that emerged from our analysis that can be used to distinguish the NPs from the NSCs is Etv1, also known as Er81. Interestingly, PFMPs expressed high levels of the transcription factor GSX1, which has been shown to play important roles in regulating interneuron development in the forebrain. PFMPs are also highly express PDGFR, CSPG4 (NG2+) Olig2 and transcripts for olfactory receptors. PFMPs also express Sox10, Gjb1, Zfp488 and Myt1 which have been shown to be important for oligodendrocyte development. The top transcription factors with unique upregulation in BNAP/GRP1s were Zfp57, Hoxac6, and Zfp955a. Unlike the other NPs, the GRP1 and GRP2 NPs expressed many proteins involved in immune cell function. In contrast, the top downregulated genes in the NPs are those involved in cilia formation, consistent with the loss of cilia as neural stem cells become multipotential progenitors.

Parameter estimates extracted from regions of interest were entered into multilevel Bayesian models to examine regional and whole-brain effects of diagnosis, and, within OCD, the influence of medication status, symptom severity, and age of onset on task activation. Results We observed a robust task activation pattern across individuals with OCD and control participants in executive control regions across tasks. Relative to controls, individuals with OCD showed moderate to very strong evidence of weaker activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, frontal eye fields, and inferior parietal lobule during executive control (all positive posterior probabilities [P+]<0.1). Individuals with OCD also showed stronger activation in regions of the default mode network during executive function relative to controls. We found little evidence for differential activation during executive control in task-positive regions related to disease onset, severity and medication status. Conclusion In the first mega-analysis of fMRI studies of executive function in OCD, we found strong evidence of weaker frontoparietal activation during executive control tasks. Our findings also suggest a failure of default mode network regions to appropriately disengage during task performance in OCD.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

For example, successfully detecting a highway exit sign is useless when your announced exit is still ten minutes away, but becomes relevant with only thirty seconds to go. Using EEG, we investigated how predictable changes in stimulus relevance influence top-down (i.e., memory-guided) visual selection. Participants memorized an oriented grating, followed by a cue indicating which of two sequentially presented probes was relevant for a memory-match/-mismatch judgment. Consistent with earlier work, relevant probes evoked stronger univariate responses than irrelevant probes. Furthermore, multivariate responses to (memory-matching and memory-mismatching) probes were more distinct when they were relevant compared to irrelevant. Crucially, using rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT), we found that early visual responses to the (empty) probe location were enhanced even before the presentation of relevant (compared to irrelevant) probes. These results demonstrate that predictable changes in stimulus relevance induce both pro-active and re-active changes in visual processing. We conclude that anticipating the (ir)relevance of upcoming visual events enables the visual system to prepare ahead of time, enabling efficient memory-guided visual selection.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

The present study explored how these oscillations mediate the extraction and updating of statistical regularities. We delivered 6 Hz in-phase transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) or sham tACS, synchronizing the bilateral prefrontal cortex during an eye-tracking probabilistic sequence learning task designed to test cognitive flexibility and assess pre-stimulus gaze direction changes. A novel probabilistic sequence with a partially overlapping structure was introduced that allowed us to distinguish between the retention of old sequences and the acquisition of new ones. Following comparable statistical learning in both groups during the practice session, our results showed that tACS reduced the incorrect anticipations of previously learned triplets that remained high-probability in the new sequence and allowed participants to more flexibly anticipate triplets newly becoming high-probability. These results suggest a role of frontal midline theta in the flexible rewiring of the mental representations of prior probabilistic structures.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Zinc finger proteins are a large family of DNA-binding factors that play key roles in diverse cellular processes including gene regulation, RNA metabolism and cell cycle control. The zinc finger protein ZNF512B has recently been implicated in chromatin organization and transcriptional repression through its direct interaction with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, its DNA-binding ability, and its association with the histone variant H2A.Z. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for ZNF512B that is independent of both its zinc finger domains and NuRD association. We identify ZNF512B as a spindle-associated factor that regulates progression through mitosis, specifically controlling metaphase exit. ZNF512B's N-terminal internal region, which contains 25 repeats of a six-residue motif predicted to form a beta-helix structure, is required and sufficient for its spindle interaction. Elevated ZNF512B levels result in a profound metaphase arrest that is ultimately lethal, a phenotype arising from the combined activity of its spindle-binding and chromatin-tethering functions. Conversely, ZNF512B depletion accelerates stem cell proliferation, impairs differentiation, and upregulates genes linked to cell cycle progression. Our findings position ZNF512B as a multifunctional protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor, a chromatin aggregator and a novel metaphase exit regulator through spindle fiber binding.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}

W.; Rosvall, K. A.", "abstract": "Sex differences have captivated scientists for a long time, yet the evolutionary rate of change in sex-biased gene expression has not been directly quantified. To address this issue, we leverage brain gene expression data from male and female songbirds. To do this, we introduce new options for unbounded Brownian motion and variable evolutionary rates among genes in the software package CAGEE (Computational Analysis of Gene Expression Evolution). We applied these new features to 10 focal songbird species, half of which have convergently evolved obligate cavity-nesting, an element of reproductive ecology linked to sex-specific changes in competition. We find that the degree of sex bias - measured as the male:female ratio in expression for each gene - evolves twice as fast on the Z chromosome vs. autosomes, but otherwise, Z gene expression does not evolve at different rates in males vs. females. Most Z-linked genes are male-biased in their expression, though some exhibit roughly equal patterns of expression. These sex-balanced genes are not skewed in their rate of evolution, contrary to the hypothesis that some genes experience selection for balance and therefore may evolve more slowly. Finally, the degree of sex bias in gene expression evolves more quickly along obligate-cavity nesting lineages, suggesting that changes in sex-specific ecological selection shape the evolution of brain sex differences, or lack thereof. Together, these tools and results provide new insights on the interplay between sex and gene expression evolution.", "date": "2025-08-21", "journal": ""}
