A.; Towbin, B. D.; Jost, D.; Meister, P.", "abstract": "Transcriptional enhancers must locate their target genes with both precision and efficiency. In mammals, this specificity is facilitated by topologically associated domains (TADs), which restrict the enhancer search space through three-dimensional genome organization. In contrast, the nematode genome lacks such TAD-based segmentation despite harboring over 30000 sequences with chromatin signature characteristic of enhancers, thereby raising the question of how enhancer-promoter specificity is achieved. Using high-resolution Hi-C in C. elegans, we identify distinct 3D chromatin structures surrounding active enhancers, which we term fountains. These structures span 38 kb in average, are unique to active enhancers, and are enriched for the major somatic cohesin complex. Fountains collapse upon in vivo cohesin cleavage, indicating their cohesin dependency. Notably, fountains accumulate topological stress, as evidenced by the enrichment of topoisomerases and the psoralen-binding signature of negatively-supercoiled DNA. Functionally, fountain disassembly correlates with transcriptional upregulation of active enhancer-proximal genes, suggesting that fountains act as spatial repressors of enhancer activity. This repression is particularly pronounced for neuronal genes, including the skn-1/Nrf gene, which becomes upregulated, switches isoform and transcription start site upon cohesin loss in a pair of head neurons. Behaviorally, cohesin cleavage alters nematode movement and foraging behavior, linking enhancer-driven transcriptional changes to neural circuit function and organismal phenotypes, reminiscent of pathologies caused by cohesin mutations in humans. Together, our findings uncover fountains as a novel 3D chromatin feature that modulates enhancer activity in a TAD-less genome, establishing a mechanistic link between genome architecture, gene regulation and behavior.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

L.; Milam, O. E.; Pedraja, F.; Cornett, J. D.; Marsat, G.", "abstract": "The detection and localization of signals rely on arrays of receptors, and their spatial organization plays a key role in determining the accuracy of the system. Weakly electric ghost knifefish rely on a distributed array of electroreceptors to detect spatially diffuse electric signals from conspecifics. While we know that spatial resolution for small objects, such as prey, is enhanced near the head due to a high receptor density, it is not clear how receptor organization influences the processing of global and diffuse signals from conspecifics. Using spatially realistic modeling, we quantified how receptor density influences detection and localization accuracy for conspecific signals across varying distances. Our main result demonstrates that receptor density markedly enhances detection accuracy in frontal regions at intermediate distances (35-50 cm) yet surprisingly contributes minimally to improving localization accuracy. This highlights a fundamental principle: receptor convergence primarily benefits signal detection when dealing with spatially diffuse stimuli, even though higher receptor density can enhance localization accuracy for spatially delineated signals. Our findings extend beyond the electrosensory modality, drawing parallels with other sensory systems, and offer broader insights into spatial processing principles.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

In natural habitats, they form complex consortia with other microorganisms, where interspecies interactions shape their ecological roles. Although in vitro studies of these consortia have significantly advanced our understanding, they often lack the biological replication needed for robust statistical analysis of shared microbiome features and functions. Moreover, the microbiomes of many model cyanobacterial strains, which are central to our understanding of cyanobacterial biology, remain poorly characterized. Here, we expanded on existing in vitro approaches by co-culturing five well-characterized model cyanobacterial strains with microorganisms filtered from three distinct freshwater sources, generating 108 stable consortia. Metagenomic analyses revealed that, despite host and inoculum diversity, these consortia converged on a similar set of non-cyanobacterial taxa, forming a 25-species core microbiome. The large number of stable consortia in this study enabled statistical validation of both previously observed and newly identified core microbiome functionalities in micronutrient biosynthesis, metabolite transport, and anoxygenic photosynthesis. Furthermore, core species showed significant enrichment of plasmids, and functions encoded on plasmids suggested plasmid-mediated roles in symbiotic interactions. Overall, our findings uncover the potential microbiomes recruited by key model cyanobacteria, demonstrate that laboratory-enriched consortia retain many taxonomic and functional traits observed more broadly in phototroph-heterotroph assemblages, and show that model cyanobacteria can serve as robust hosts for uncovering functional roles underlying cyanobacterial community dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

To evaluate existing models of neurocognitive ageing such as compensation, maintenance, or reserve, we explore how various known brain-based and cardiorespiratory fitness factors intersect to better understand cognitive decline. In a pre-registered study (https://osf.io/6fqg7), we tested 73 healthy older adults aged 60 to 81 (M = 65.51, SD = 4.94) and collected neuroimaging (functional, structural, and perfusion MRI), cardiorespiratory fitness, and cognitive data to investigate a prominent challenge for older adults: word-finding failures. fMRI signal was recorded while participants responded to a definition-based tip-of-the-tongue task, T1-weighted imaging estimated grey matter volume, and cerebral blood flow was indexed using multi-delay pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling. Commonality analyses were used to analyse these multi-domain data (neuroimaging, cardiorespiratory fitness, language skills, demographic characteristics) and uncover associations between predictors in explaining age-related tip-of-the-tongue rates. Commonality analyses revealed that functional activation of language networks associated with tip-of-the-tongue states is in part linked with age and, interestingly, cardiorespiratory fitness: the combination of higher cardiorespiratory fitness and functional recruitment in some older adults offsets part of the age-related variance in tip-of-the-tongues. Moreover, age-associated atrophy and perfusion in regions other than those showing functional differences accounted for variance in tip-of-the-tongues. Our findings can be interpreted in the context of the classic models of neurocognitive ageing, suggesting compensation. Brain health indices in concordance with cardiorespiratory fitness can provide a more holistic explanation of individual differences in age-related cognitive decline.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular interplay between oncogenic KrasG12D/+(Kras*) and transcription factor CREB in promoting pancreatic cancer progression under chronic inflammation remains poorly understood. METHODS: Experimental alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP) induction was established in multiple mouse models, with euthanasia during the recovery stage to evaluate tumor latency. CREB was selectively deleted (Crebfl/fl) in Ptf1aCreERTM/+;LSL-KrasG12D+/-(KC) genetic mouse (KCC-/-). Pancreata from Ptf1aCreERTM+/-, KC and KCC-/-  mice were analyzed using histological profiling, western blotting, phosphokinase array, and quantitative PCR. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in ACP-induced KC mice. Lineage tracing analysis using YFP reporter mice and acinar cell explant cultures analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: ACP induction in KC mice significantly impaired the pancreas repair mechanism. Acinar cell-derived ductal lesions demonstrated sustained CREB hyperactivation in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM)/pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions associated with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Persistent CREB activity reprogrammed acinar cells and increased profibrotic inflammation. Notably, acinar-specific Creb deletion in ACP induced models suppressed high-grade PanIN development, restrained tumor progression, and improved acinar cell function. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that CREB cooperates with Kras* to promote irreversible ADM, accelerating pancreatic cancer progression with ACP. Targeting CREB may present a promising strategy to mitigate inflammation-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

We found synchronous ensembles comprising approximately 40% of CA1 pyramidal neurons, firing simultaneously in brief windows ([~]25ms) during immobility and locomotion in novel exploration. Notably, these synchronous ensembles were not associated with contralateral ripple oscillations but were instead phase-locked to theta waves recorded in the contralateral CA1 region. Moreover, the subthreshold membrane potentials of neurons exhibited coherent intracellular theta oscillations with a depolarizing peak at the moment of synchrony. Among newly formed place cells, pairs with more robust synchronization during locomotion displayed more distinct place-specific activities.

Here, we show that embryo polarization is unexpectedly asynchronous. Cells polarizing at the early and late 8-cell stage have distinct molecular and morphological properties that direct their following lineage specification, with early polarizing cells being biased towards producing the TE lineage. More recent studies have also implicated heterogeneities between cells prior to the 8-cell stage in the first lineage allocation: cells exhibiting reduced methyltransferase CARM1 activity at the 4-cell stage are predisposed towards the TE fate. Here, we demonstrate that reduced CARM1 activity and upregulation of its substrate BAF155 promote early polarization and TE specification.

However, training an HMM on cortical data requires a careful handling of model selection, since models with more numerous hidden states generally have a higher likelihood on new (unseen) data. A potentially related problem is the occurrence of very rapid state switching after decoding the data with an HMM. The first problem can lead to overfitting and over-segmentation of the data. The second problem is due to intermediate- to-low self-transition probabilities and is at odds with many reports that hidden states in cortex tend to last from hundred of milliseconds to seconds. Here, we show that we can alleviate both problems by regularizing a Poisson-HMM during training so as to enforce large self-transition probabilities. We call this algorithm the  sticky Poisson-HMM (sPHMM). The sPHMM successfully eliminates rapid state switching, outperforming an alternative strategy based on an HMM with a large prior on the self-transition probabilities. When used together with the Bayesian Information Criterion for model selection, the sPHMM also captures the ground truth in surrogate datasets built to resemble the statistical properties of the experimental data.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Motivated by the genomic and phenotypic differences across Akkermansia muciniphila strains and Akkermansia (Akk) phylogroups (AmIa, AmIb, AmII, AmIII and AmIV), we analyzed fecal metagenomic sequencing data from four publicly available NSCLC cohorts (n = 575). Encouragingly, we found that patients responses to PD-1 blockade are significantly different across different Akk phylogroups, highlighting the relatively stronger association between AmIa and positive responses than the other phylogroups. We built a machine learning model based on Akk gene profiles, which improved the predictive power and shed light on a group of Akk genes that may be associated with the response to PD-1 blockade.

We characterized metagenomes of six prairie soils spanning a steep precipitation gradient in Kansas, USA. By statistically controlling for variation in soil porosity and elemental profiles, we identified bacterial taxa and functional gene categories associated with precipitation. This microbial precipitation legacy persisted through a 5-month-long experimental drought and mitigated the negative physiological effects of acute drought for a wild grass species that is native to the precipitation gradient, but not for the domesticated crop species maize. In particular, microbiota with a low-precipitation legacy altered transcription of a subset of host genes that mediate transpiration and intrinsic water use efficiency during drought.

L.", "abstract": "While we often assume that memory encoding occurs from an in-body (first-person) perspective, out-of-body experiences demonstrate that we can form memories from a third-person perspective. This phenomenon provides a distinctive opportunity to examine the interaction between embodiment and visual perspective during encoding, and how this interplay shapes the recall of past events. Participants formed memories for naturalistic events following a manipulation of their sense of embodiment from in-body and out-of-body perspectives and recalled them during functional scanning. Region of interest multivariate analyses examined how the angular gyrus, precuneus, and hippocampus reflected visual perspective, embodiment, and their interaction during remembering. Patterns of activity during retrieval in the left angular gyrus and bilateral precuneus predicted embodiment on its own separated from visual perspective. In contrast, we observed only inconclusive evidence that these posterior parietal regions predicted visual perspective independent of embodiment. While the left angular gyrus distinguished between in-body and out-of-body perspectives during the retrieval of events associated with both strong and weak embodiment, decoding accuracy predicting visual perspective was only above chance for events encoded with strong embodiment in the precuneus bilaterally. Our results suggest that the contribution of posterior parietal regions in establishing visual perspectives within memories is tightly interconnected with embodiment. Encoding events from an embodied in-body perspective compared to embodied out-of-body perspective led to higher memory accuracy following repeated retrieval.

Many host genes that affect symbiosis have been identified; however, the extent to which these genes affect selection acting on rhizobia is unknown. In this study, we inoculated 18 Medicago truncatula symbiotic mutants (including mutants that alter NCR peptide production, plant defence, and nodule number regulation) with a mixture of 86 Sinorhizobium meliloti strains. Most mutations led to reduced host benefits, but effects on rhizobial benefit (i.e., relative strain fitness) varied widely, revealing widespread host gene by strain fitness interactions. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants on rhizobial replicons pSymA and pSymB as important in mediating strain fitness responses to host mutations. While most top variants only affected rhizobial fitness with one host mutant (limited effect variants), nine affected fitness across six or more host mutations. These pervasive variants occurred primarily on pSymA, the symbiotic replicon, and include fixL and a few metabolic genes. In contrast to the limited effect variants, variants with pervasive positive effects on strain fitness when host genes were mutated tended to adversely affect fitness in wild-type hosts. Our results reveal how host symbiosis genes affect rhizobial fitness and set the stage for improving rhizobial inoculants and breeding legume hosts better adapted for multi-strain environments.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

The S. cerevisiae Silent Information Regulator complex (SIRc) carries out all of the core functions of heterochromatin. SIR complexes first drive the initiation and spreading of histone deacetylation in an iterative manner. Subsequently, the same complexes are incorporated stably with nucleosomes, driving compaction and repression of the underlying chromatin domain. These two distinct functions of SIRc have each been characterized in much detail, but the mechanism by which the dynamic spreading state switches to stable compaction is not well-understood. This incomplete knowledge of potential intra-complex communication is partly due to a lack of structural information of the complex as a whole; only structures of fragments have been determined to date. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry in solution, we identified a novel inter-subunit interaction that physically connects the two states of SIRc. The Sir2 deacetylase makes direct interactions with the scaffolding subunit Sir4 through its coiled-coil domain, which also interacts with the Sir3 compaction/repression subunit. Within the hub of interactions are conserved residues in Sir2 that can sense deacetylation state, as well as amino acids that likely diverged and co-evolved to interact with Sir4, promoting species-specific functions. Mutation of this interaction hub disrupts heterochromatic repression, potentially by disrupting a conserved mechanism that communicates completion of deacetylation to switch to compaction. Our work highlights how a single multi-functional chromatin regulatory complex can stage a step-wise mechanism that requires a major transition in activities to achieve epigenetic gene repression.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated how such explicit reliability markers are integrated and the extent to which individuals have metacognitive insight into this process. We developed a novel paradigm where participants viewed opinions from sources of varying reliability to make a choice between two options. After each decision, they rated how much they felt a given source influenced their choice. Using computational modelling, we estimated the effective reliability participants assigned to each source and how leaky their decision process was. Overall, we found that participants acted as if sources were more informative than they actually were, inflating the reliability they were communicated. Interestingly, we show that even though sources were explicitly labelled as unreliable, these sources biased choices, as if these were treated as moderately reliable. Additionally, the presence of sources known to be lying, reliably voting for the incorrect answer, impaired performance by increasing decision leakiness. Despite these biases, participants showed some metacognitive awareness of what influenced their choices: they were generally accurate in reporting the degree to which a source influenced them and were aware of the impact unreliable sources had on their decisions.

There exists a dire need for new treatments, especially those that synergize with our existing arsenal of antibiotic drugs, to help overcome the gap in antibiotic efficacy and attenuate the development of new antibiotic resistance in the most dangerous pathogens. Quorum-sensing systems in bacteria drive the formation of biofilms, increase surface motility, and enhance other virulence factors, making these systems attractive targets for the discovery of novel antibacterials. Quorum-sensing inhibitors (QSIs) are hypothesized to synergize with existing antibiotics, making bacteria more sensitive to the effects of these drugs. In this study, we aimed to find the synergistic combinations between the QSIs and known antibiotics to combat the two deadliest hospital infections - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. We mined biochemical activity databases and literature to identify known, high-efficacy QSIs against these bacteria. We used these data to develop and validate a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model for predicting QSI activity and then employed this model to identify new potential QSIs from the Inxight database of approved and investigational drugs. We then tested binary mixtures of the identified QSIs with 11 existing antibiotics using a combinatorial matrix screening approach with ten (five of each) clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.

G.; Schumer, M.", "abstract": "How barriers to gene flow arise between closely related species is one of the oldest questions in evolutionary biology. Classic models in evolutionary biology predict that negative epistatic interactions between variants in the genomes of diverged lineages, known as hybrid incompatibilities, will reduce viability or fertility in hybrids. The genetic architecture of these interactions and the evolutionary paths through which they arise have profound implications for the efficacy of hybrid incompatibilities as barriers to gene flow between species. While these questions have been studied using theoretical approaches for several decades, only recently has it become possible to genetically map larger numbers of hybrid incompatibilities. Here, we use admixture mapping in natural hybrid populations of swordtail fish (Xiphophorus) to identify hybrid incompatibilities involving genetic interactions between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. We find that at least nine regions of the genome are involved in mitonuclear incompatibilities. These incompatibilities involve interactions between the nuclear genome and the X. malinche mitochondria, the X. birchmanni mitochondria, or both. Moreover, they vary in the strength of selection they experience, and the degree to which they limit gene flow in natural hybrid populations. Our results build a deeper understanding of the complex architecture of selection against incompatibilities in naturally hybridizing species and highlight an important role of mitonuclear interactions in the evolution of reproductive barriers between closely related species.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Axolotls can regenerate lost limbs throughout their lives, while they continue to grow. This poses the question of how the size and pattern of a regenerating limb is matched to a widely varying animal size. Two interacting signaling molecules, SHH and FGF8, are produced at opposite sides of the regenerating limb and sustain tissue growth through a pair of oppositely-oriented signaling gradients. As the size of the regrowing tissue can vary more than three-fold depending on the size of the animal, it is unclear how the activities of these mutually dependent morphogens are maintained and subsequently terminated to determine appropriate growth. Scaling of limb regeneration suggests a size-dependent adaptation of morphogen gradient parameters. Inspired by this biological example, we theoretically investigate general mechanisms of morphogen-controlled growth arrest and proportional growth. In the proposed mechanism, tissue growth increases the spatial distance between the two morphogen gradients, thus providing negative feedback that eventually arrests morphogen activity and growth. We put forward two distinct scaling scenarios of morphogen gradients: either dynamic scaling with blastema size, where morphogen gradient parameters change dynamically with the growing tissue, or static scaling with animal size, where morphogen gradient parameters stay constant during blastema growth and only depend on animal size. We show that static scaling ensures proportional growth, but dynamic scaling does not. We compare theory predictions to experimental quantification of SHH and FGF8 morphogen gradient parameters at different time-points of regeneration in different-sized animals, indicating static scaling for some morphogen parameters, which is sufficient to ensure proportional growth in our model.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

In mouse embryonic liver cells, inactivation of all three HP1 isoforms led to accumulation of retrotransposon-derived RNAs and stabilization of enhancer RNAs. These changes coincided with increased activity at a subset of liver enhancers particularly sensitive to reduced exosome activity, many of which regulate genes encoding extracellular matrix components such as Col6a1 and Col6a2. Stratifying hepatocellular carcinoma samples by HP1 expression further revealed that tumors with low HP1 were marked by reduced RNA degradation, and increased expression of a similar subset of genes encoding extracellular matrix components and possibly contributing to tumor stiffness.

R.; Lee, S.-K.; Moss, F. J.; Boron, W. F.", "abstract": "The traditional view had been that dissolved gases cross membranes simply by dissolving in and diffusing through membrane lipid. However, some membranes are impermeable to CO2 and NH3, whereas some aquaporin (AQP) water channels--tetramers with hydrophobic central pores--are permeable to CO2, NH3, or both. Nevertheless, we understand neither the routes that CO2 and NH3 take through AQP tetramers, nor the basis of CO2/NH3 selectivity. Here, we show--for human AQP1 (hAQP1)--that virtually all NH3 and H2O pass through the hydrophilic, monomeric pores. However CO2 passes both through the monomeric pores and another pathway. We expressed hAQP1 in Xenopus oocytes and used microelectrodes to monitor the maximal surface-pH transient ({Delta}pHS) caused by CO2 or NH3 influxes. We found that p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate (pCMBS)--which reacts with C189 in the monomeric pore--eliminates the entire hAQP1-dependent (*) NH3 signal ({Delta}pHS*)NH, but only half of the signals for CO2 ({Delta}pHS*)CO2 or osmotic water permeability Pf*. 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS), eliminates the remaining ({Delta}pHS*)CO2 but has no effect on ({Delta}pHS*)NH or Pf*. Together, the two drugs completely eliminate the CO2 permeability of hAQP1. When we express hAQP1 in Pichia pastoris, treat spheroplasts with DIDS, and examine hAQP1 by SDS-PAGE, reactivity with an anti-DIDS antibody shows that DIDS crosslinks hAQP1 monomers. Our results provide the first evidence that a molecule can move through an AQP via a route other than the monomeric pore, and raise the possibility that selectivity depends on the extent to which CO2/NH3 move through monomeric pores vs. an alternate pathway (e.g., the central pore).", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Historically, their conformational states have been defined by the DFG motif: DFGin and DFGout. However, this binary paradigm overlooks the broader conformational heterogeneity of apo kinases, which encompasses multiple metastable states within an expanded DFG--Phe ensemble. We introduced a novel nomenclature that integrates the dynamics of the DFG-Phe, activation loop, and C-helix, highlighting how these regions respond to various ensemble perturbations (e.g., mutations, ligand binding, and protein-protein interactions). A major bottleneck in studying kinases lies in sampling their wide-ranging conformations because static snapshots often remain trapped in specific free energy minima, limiting traditional molecular dynamics simulations from exploring multiple functionally relevant states starting from a single structure. To accelerate conformational sampling, we introduce a computational framework that integrates AlphaFold, machine learning, physics--based simulations, and Markov state modeling. Rather than focusing on single--structure snapshots or structural hypotheses generated by protein structure prediction models, our framework captures shifts in conformational populations under varying perturbations, shedding light on both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the transitions. We show generalizability of our ensemble definitions and protocol across members of serine-threonine kinases and tyrosine kinases. A key innovation lies in our machine learning algorithms, which capture slowly varying structural features to uncover hidden states and generate latent representations of conformational motions across different kinase domains. The physics--refined structural ensemble sampled from the latent layers is then used to launch new simulations that more comprehensively explore the full conformational landscape than traditional molecular simulation approaches. By capturing how these conformational shifts influence downstream protein--protein interactions, conformational allostery, and cryptic pocket formation, our accelerated simulation framework provides deeper insights into generalized molecular recognition mechanism in kinases and how conformational heterogeneity is influenced by ensemble perturbations.

Yet, microbiome-mediated impacts of global change on metabolic health have received little attention. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disease with rapidly increasing global prevalence, uncertain pathogenesis and influences from gut microbiome-host interactions and environmental factors. Soil microbiomes shift in composition and functional capacity with ecosystem condition and are an important source for priming and resupplying the human gut microbiome, which is critical in metabolism. Here, we sought to examine overlapping functional capacities in model case study microbiome datasets from (1) soils from a gradient of ecosystem quality (from highly disturbed to mature/natural sites under forest ecosystem restoration) and (2) gut microbiomes in T2D versus normal health to investigate plausible links between ecosystem degradation and metabolic anomalies encoded in T2D gut microbiomes. We developed a novel method to translate microbiome functional capacities (i.e., functional gene-associated biochemical pathway relative abundances) to  compound processing potential (CPP, %), reflecting the potential metabolism of individual compounds. Examining selected compounds relevant to soil and gut health, and via exhaustive compound-wide trend analyses, we identified compounds that shared potential metabolism trends. We found increased potential metabolism for sugars and decreased potential metabolism for lignin and monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids, in both T2D and degraded ecosystems. These trends were confirmed in two separate T2D case study cohorts from Sweden and China, suggesting a generalizable pattern. Our findings support a consequential new hypothesis that excessive exposures to degraded ecosystem soil microbiomes may distort gut microbiome functional capacities and metabolism and thereby contribute to type 2 diabetes.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

We found that AP activity (APA) and eukaryotic transcripts for DOP utilization were present throughout the CCE. In bottle incubations, APA was upregulated in response to iron (Fe) and nitrogen (N) additions. Major contributors to these trends included atypical alkaline phosphatases (APaty) of diatoms in the coastal upwelling area, and unclassified non-cytoplasmic P-diesterases (PDEnc) of multiple eukaryotic taxa in the offshore regime. APA and gene expression dynamics were not coupled to phytoplankton growth, suggesting that these organisms experience underlying P stress, a state of cellular metabolism caused by Pi scarcity, even in regions primarily growth-limited by other elements. While APaty and PDEnc were highly abundant among the microbial community phosphatase pool, these genes were missing from a widely used annotation database, highlighting the importance of manual curation for the detection of these atypical and unclassified proteins.

Xkr8, is activated by caspase-mediated proteolytic cleavage, and in synergy with inactivation of P4-ATPase flippases, results in the irreversible externalization of PS on apoptotic cells and an \"eat-me\" signal for efferocytosis. In contrast, TMEM16F is a calcium activated scramblase that reversibly externalizes PS on viable cells via the transient increase in intracellular calcium in live cells. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is abundant with exposed PS, resulting from prolonged oncogenic and metabolic stresses and high apoptotic indexes of tumors. Such chronic PS externalization in the TME has been linked to host immune evasion from interactions of PS with inhibitory PS receptors such as TAM and TIM receptors. Here, in an effort to better understand the contributions of apoptotic vs live cell PS-externalization to tumorigenesis and immune evasion, we employed an E0771 orthotopic breast cancer model and genetically ablated Xkr8 and TMEM16F using CRISPR/Cas9. While neither the knockout of Xkr8 nor TMEM16F showed defects in cell intrinsic properties related to proliferation, tumor-sphere formation, and growth factor signaling, both knockouts suppressed tumorigenicity in immune-competent mice, but not in NOD/SCID or RAG-KO immune-deficient strains. Mechanistically, Xkr8-KO tumors suppressed macrophage-mediated efferocytosis, and TMEM16F-KO suppressed ER stress/calcium-induced PS externalization. Our data support an emerging idea in immune-oncology that constitutive PS externalization, mediated by scramblase dysregulation on tumor cells, supports immune evasion in the tumor microenvironment. This links apoptosis/efferocytosis and oncogenic stress involving calcium dysregulation, contributing to PS-mediated immune escape and cancer progression.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate the factors that can shift competitive incentives against higher- or lower-ranking groupmates, that is, more or less powerful individuals. We use a long-term behavioural dataset on five wild groups of the two gorilla species starting in 1998, and we show that most aggression is directed from higher- to lower-ranking adult females close in rank, highlighting rank-reinforcement incentives. Yet, females directed 42% of aggression to higher-ranking females than themselves. Females targeted groupmates of higher rank with increasing number of males in the group, suggesting that males might buffer female-female aggression risk. Contrarily, they targeted females of lower rank with increasing number of females in the group, potentially because this is a low risk option that females prefer when they have access to a larger pool of competitors to choose from. Lactating and pregnant females, especially those in the latest stage of pregnancy, targeted groupmates of higher rank than the groupmates that cycling females targeted, suggesting that energetic needs may motivate females to risk confrontation with more powerful rivals.

The absence of specific antivirals for arbovirus infections underscores the urgent need for novel research to develop effective treatments. Natural products have emerged as promising candidates. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a natural lignan predominantly found in Larrea spp., has shown antiviral activity against several viruses, including Dengue. This study aimed to investigate the antiviral potential of NDGA against West Nile virus (WNV), assessing its mechanism of action and cellular interactions. Using plaque-forming unit reduction and immunofluorescence assays in LLC-MK2 cells, we determine the reduction in viability of WNV viral particles at different times post-infection. The potential involvement of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) and 5-lipoxygenase pathways in WNV infection was evaluated. Additionally, we analyzed the cytoskeleton integrity in treated cells. NDGA, had the greatest inhibitory effect on WNV replication when added 1 and 2 h post-viral internalization (PI), losing activity when added after 3 h PI, thus suggesting it targets early viral infection events. The SREBP pathway seems to be involved in the inhibition of WNV by NDGA, likely due to its lipogenic activity. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of NDGA could be related to its ability to modify the cytoskeleton of LLC-MK2 cells.

MeCP2 functions as both transcription activator and repressor but its full range of activity remains largely unknown. Recent study suggests that beyond DNA binding, MBD domain of MeCP2 also interacts with methylated lysine residues on histone H3 tail. In this study we aimed to characterize the methyllysine binding pocket of MeCP2-MBD. Structural analysis reveals the presence of an aromatic cage formed by five residues, namely, W104, F132, Y141, F142, and F155, where the trimethyllysine of H3K27me3 binds, as confirmed in docking studies. Alanine substitution of these residues abolished binding of MeCP2-MBD with its reported ligand H3K27me3 in ITC and pull-down experiments. Genomic analysis of publicly available ChIP-seq data reveals that MeCP2 localizes with canonical histone methylation marks like H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 and regulate critical biological and cancer related pathways. Promoters of MeCP2 regulated genes, show signature of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3.

Despite intensive study, the mechanisms of signal sensing by sensor kinases are incompletely defined and the mechanisms by which SKs can sense multiple ligands are unclear.

However, little information is available about how polyamines improve salt tolerance.\n\nMethodsThis study was conducted to investigate whether exogenous polyamine application has the potential to maintain poplar growth and yield under a short duration of salt stress. We analyzed the trends in growth and physiological and biochemical responses of hybrid poplar (Populus nigra x maximowiczii, clone NM6) plants to salt stress by foliar application of putrescine (a diamine). Leaves of young greenhouse-grown plants were sprayed with 1 mM putrescine on several days following one-time application of 100 mM and 200 mM NaCl via roots. For measurement of growth, plant height, stem diameter, and leaf number for each plant were recorded throughout the experiment. Studies on the physiological and biochemical trends included gas exchange, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, soluble sugars and proteins, amino acids, polyamines, and relative water content in leaves.\n\nResultsPutrescine spray on the salt-treated plants caused a significant increase in chlorophyll a & b, carotenoids, and soluble proteins on a fresh weight basis. Putrescine application caused a significant increase in fructose, glucose, and galactose in all plants, but putrescine spray had a variable impact on the sucrose content of 100 mM NaCl-treated plants. Based on metabolic responses, plants treated with 100 mM NaCl fared better when sprayed with putrescine than those treated with 200 mM NaCl.\n\nDiscussionIn conclusion, the results indicate that putrescine did reverse the effects of salt in many ways, and there were trends indicating that sprayed putrescine promotes salt tolerance in young poplar plants.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Collective neuronal activities, such as neural avalanches and synchronized oscillations, are also found under rest conditions, and these features have been suggested to support sensory processing, brain readiness for rapid responses, and computational efficiency. The rat barrel cortex and thalamus circuit, with its somatotopic organization for processing whisker movements, provides a powerful system to explore such interplay. To characterize these resting state circuits, we perform simultaneous multi-electrode recordings in rats' barrel cortex and thalamus. During spontaneous activity, oscillations with frequencies centered around 11.5 Hz are detected concomitantly with slow oscillations below 4 Hz, as well as power-law distributed avalanches. The phase of the lower-frequency oscillation appears to modulate the higher-frequency amplitude, and it has a role in gating avalanche occurrences. We then record neural activity during controlled whisker movements to confirm that the 11.5 Hz barrel circuit active at rest is indeed the one involved in response to whisker stimulation. We finally show how a thalamic-driven firing-rate model can describe the entire phenomenology observed at resting state and predict the response of the barrel cortex to controlled whisker movement.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Co-chaperones, such as Aha1, play a key role in regulating the ATP-dependent Hsp90 client activation cycle by modulating Hsp90's ATPase activity and controlling progression through the cycle. Two highly conserved motifs in Aha1-the NxNNWHW and RKxK motifs-are known to regulate specific aspects of the Hsp90 ATPase cycle. In this study, we demonstrate that the K60 residue within the RKxK motif facilitates the structural organization of the NxNNWHW motif prior to ATP hydrolysis. Mutation of the K60 residue partially impairs the in vivo functionality of yeast Aha1. Additionally, we reveal that each individual residue within the NxNNWHW motif modulates the ATPase rate and apparent affinity for ATP of Hsp90.

Here, we investigated whether mice exhibit fear of predators across four experimental contexts: one in a novel head-fixed condition and three in established, freely moving scenarios. In head-fixed mice, we measured the behavioral outcome and response to a live rat. Mice were water-deprived and habituated to walk on a treadmill that controlled a virtual environment and reward delivery. After meeting performance criteria, baseline data were collected in one session, followed by a test session in which the mice were exposed to a live rat. Despite the presence of the predator, most (5 out of 7) mice continued to forage at baseline levels; however, individual mice showed significant alterations in one or more of the following measures: running speed, pupil size, eye movement, and posture. To assess how behavioral context and physical restraint influence predator responses, we exposed 36 naive, freely moving mice to fear-inducing stimuli -- including looming visual cues, rat odor, and a live rat. Even in these conditions, a substantial proportion of mice failed to exhibit classical defensive responses such as avoidance or escape. Notably, when presented with a freely moving rat, only about half of the mice displayed avoidance behavior. Together, these findings suggest that mice do not universally express innate fear behaviors such as avoidance or fleeing, even in ethologically relevant predator encounters. Instead, their responses appear to be context-dependent and variable, challenging common assumptions about automatic defensive reactions in rodents.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Monitoring the evolution of insecticide resistance alleles and their spatial heterogeneity is important for malaria control programmes, and genomic surveillance has emerged as a pivotal tool for this purpose. Earlier genomics research has typically employed convenience-based sampling, and research has yet to be performed to optimise sampling regimens for malaria vector genomics. In an earlier study, we developed a spatially explicit sampling framework that considers the underlying ecology to enable sampling mosquitoes with reduced bias. We applied this framework to sample and perform whole-genome sequencing on 485 individual specimens of An. gambiae s.l mosquitoes from Obuasi, central Ghana, an area with extensive gold mining activities. In this region, An. gambiae s.l have been documented as highly resistant to multiple insecticides, including pyrethroids used for the treatment of bed-nets. High resolution of fine-scale population structure enabled the detection of isolation-by-distance in An. coluzzii in Obuasi, whilst finding that at this scale, geographic distance, rather than the underlying habitat, drives population structure. We examine methods to estimate mosquito kinship, demonstrating that polymorphic chromosomal inversions significantly confound established analytical tools, while revealing how the mosquitos chromosome architecture generates high variance in genetic relatedness among kin. Using genome-wide selection scans and clustering, we discover the novel mutations Gste2-F120L and Cyp9K1-N224I in detoxification enzymes that are driving selective sweeps, likely in response to insecticidal pressure. We find that the frequencies of some resistance variants are associated with artisanal-gold mines, and elucidate the continued evolution of the Voltage-gated sodium channel, the target of pyrethroid insecticides.

While successful in capturing fundamental learning phenomena across human and animal studies, these models are not capable of representing variability in human experiences that are common in many real-world contexts. Indeed, where variation in outcome magnitude exists (e.g., severity of illness in a medical scenario), this class of models are, at best, approximate the outcome mean with no ability to represent the underlying distribution of values. In this paper, we introduce one approach to incorporating a distributed architecture into a prediction error learning model that tracks the contingency between cues and dimensional outcomes. Our Distributed Model allows associative links to form between the cue and outcome nodes that provide distributed representation depending on the magnitude of the outcome, thus enabling learning that extends beyond approximating the mean. Comparing the Distributed Model against a Simple Delta Model across four contingency learning experiments, we found that the Distributed Model provides significantly better fit to empirical data in virtually all participants.

Our design dissociates preparatory (cue phase) and reconstructive (probe phase) mechanisms to isolate the neural signatures of retrieval orientation, the strategic use of cues to optimize retrieval. Whole-brain and ROI analyses revealed that the angular gyrus (AG) and precuneus support perspective-guided retrieval in distinct ways. During the cue phase, PGp showed greater activity for instructed perspectives than natural retrieval, consistent with preparatory perspective selection. During the probe phase, observer-perspective retrieval elicited greater activity in PGp and precuneus (7P), supporting sustained perspective maintenance.

AF9, identified as a reader of histone H3 lysine 9 lactylation (H3K9la), promotes KLF2 expression, while KLF2, functioning as a transcription factor for AF9, forms a positive feedback loop that amplifies lactylation-dependent effects. This circuit activates tumor-associated pathways, including TGF{beta}1, glucose and lactate transporters, and metabolic enzymes essential for glycolysis and serine biosynthesis, driving tumorigenesis and metastasis.

Cell viability, melanin quantification and tyrosinase activity assay demonstrated that Fc-diOH treatment reduced the amount of intracellular melanin and tyrosinase activity by 32 and by 25%, respectively, in B16F10 melanoma cells at 25 nM without significant cellular toxicity. Furthermore, the biological activity of Fc-diOH against melanogenesis was confirmed in in vivo experiments using zebrafish Danio rerio embryos. We found that Fc-diOH inhibited melanin production and tyrosinase activity of zebrafish embryos treated with 0.5 and 2 {micro}M respectively, without affecting embryonic development or viability. In addition and interestingly, molecular docking analysis demonstrates that the p-hydroxyphenyl groups of Fc-diOH make close contacts with the active site of tyrosinase, compared to arbutin and phenylthiourea, which could be due to its structural homology with the tyrosinase substrate. Therefore, these results strongly suggest that Fc-diOH decreases tyrosinase activity, thereby negatively regulating melanogenesis in B16F10 cells and zebrafish embryos.

SS treatment upregulates the tumor-suppressive microRNA let-7b, which directly targets K-Ras and suppresses downstream ERK signaling. Notably, K-Ras negatively regulates let-7b via activation of ERK and LIN28B, forming a reciprocal feedback loop that drives transformation. SS disrupts this loop by downregulating p-ERK and LIN28B, thereby restoring let-7b expression. Functional analyses confirmed that let-7b, but not let-7g, is required for SS-mediated inhibition of transformation. In human colon cancer tissues and cell lines, let-7b is downregulated, but restored upon SS treatment. These findings identify a novel let-7b/K-Ras/LIN28B/ERK regulatory axis targeted by SS and provide mechanistic insight into its role in early-stage cancer chemoprevention.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

LMNA encodes the proteins LAMINs A and C, which assemble with LAMIN B1 and B2 to form the nuclear lamina: a meshwork providing structural stability to the nucleus that also regulates chromatin organisation and gene expression. Research into L-CMD mechanisms and therapies i hindered by lack of humanised, tissue-specific models that accurately recapitulate disease phenotypes. We previously reported that LMNA-mutant induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived skeletal muscle cells have nuclear shape abnormalities and LAMIN A/C protein mislocalisation. Here, we expand the selection of L-CMD patient-derived iPSCs and validate disease-associated readouts using a transgene-free based protocol which more accurately mimics skeletal myogenesis. Results showed no defects in developmental myogenesis, but recapitulation of pathological nuclear shape abnormalities in 2D and 3D cultures, nuclear envelope protein mislocalisation and transcriptomic alterations across multiple pathogenic LMNA variants. We then utilised this platform to assess LMNA gene editing strategies. CRISPR-based exon removal generated stable RNA and protein LAMIN A/C species, without significant normalisation of nuclear morphological phenotypes. Conversely, precise editing of the same mutation showed complete reversal of disease-associated nuclear morphometrics.

These dynamic and reversible modifications are specifically recognized by reader RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which mediate the regulation of gene expression, RNA processing, localization, stability, and translation. Given their crucial functions, any disruptions in the normal activity of these readers can have significant implications for cellular health. Consequently, the dysregulation of these RBPs has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, cancers, and viral infections. Therefore, there has been growing interest in targeting reader RBPs as a potential therapeutic strategy since developing molecules that restore proper RNA processing and function may offer a promising avenue for treating diseases. In this work, we coupled our previously established live-cell RNA-protein interaction (RPI) assay, RNA interaction with Protein-mediated Complementation Assay (RiPCA), with CRISPR technology to build a new platform, CRISPR RiPCA.

Nevertheless, in humans, both iron deficiency and disorders of iron overload are widespread. How cellular iron content varies depending upon iron availability, and how this influences cell function is poorly characterised. We developed a method to quantify metals in hundreds of cells per minute via single-cell inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sc-ICP-MS), and used this to explore iron usage by immune cells. Activated murine T-cells exposed to a 625-fold titration of extracellular iron maintained close homeostatic control, with iron content varying by [~]20%. However, these variations strongly correlated with activation characteristics and proliferation. Running sc-ICP-MS downstream of flow cytometric sorting showed that murine T-cells and B-cells ex vivo exhibit similar mean and heterogeneity of cellular iron while splenic macrophages contain twice as much iron and more heterogeneous iron content. Finally, activated human B-cells contain [~]10-fold more iron per cell than murine B-cells. We suggest that mechanisms of iron homeostasis impart particular ranges or set-points of iron content to different cell types and activation states, and that small changes in iron content have large effects on cell behaviour.

Muscle cells constantly respond to various endogenous stressors while actively maintaining critical metabolic functions for the tissue and whole animal. The molecular mechanisms of how muscle stress responses transcriptionally reprogram metabolic networks are complex and inadequately understood. Using a multi-omics approach of metabolomics, lipidomics, and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing in Drosophila, we reconstructed the physiological landscape of muscle during chronic activation of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress response that ensures the secretion of vital proteins from muscle, known as myokines. By ectopically expressing a constitutively active form of X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1), a highly conserved transcription factor (TF) and UPR effector, we found that UPR downregulates key metabolic pathways in muscle, including carbohydrate and purine metabolism, while upregulating a robust lipogenic program enriched for phospholipids and several antioxidant metabolic pathways. Using gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis, we linked these metabolic changes to distinct TF regulon activities. The activation of a single TF, Xbp1, increased the activity of other stress response TFs in muscle, including cap-n-collar (cnc/Nrf2), cryptocephal (crc/Atf4), and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP). Simultaneously, we observed decreased activity of TFs, namely Forkhead box O (FoxO), that resulted in downregulated metabolic pathways critical to muscle function, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. We propose that these GRNs antagonize each other downstream of UPR to reprogram muscle metabolism away from carbohydrates and towards lipogenesis, offering novel insight into how metabolic rewiring can be transcriptionally controlled in response to chronic tissue damage, even to the detriment of organ function.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Skeletal myogenesis requires precise spatio-temporal regulation of molecular signals during prenatal and postnatal development. Prenatal myogenesis in mouse commences at embryonic day (E) 9.5, characterized by the expression of PAX3 -a key myogenic regulator, and its target MET, in the embryonic muscle progenitor cells (EMPCs). These EMPCs delaminate from dermomyotome in the somites and migrate to designated areas such as the developing embryonic limbs and diaphragm. The trajectory of their migration is directed and limited by spatio-temporal availability of the MET ligand (HGF). Given its periodic expression during embryonic myogenesis and its recent association with familial arthrogryposis, it is important to identify additional non-migratory functions of MET signaling. We find conditional loss of Met in the Pax3/somitic lineage affects survival in early neonatal stages because amuscular diaphragms cause respiratory distress. Impaired progenitor migration in conditional Met knockouts (cMetKO) results in highly dysplastic muscles in neonates compared to muscleless limbs observed in previous mutants. Additionally, using cMetKO embryos (E11.5) we identify Slit1 as a novel target of MET that is downregulated in the mutant limb buds. Pharmacological modulation with SU11274, in vitro, confirms Slit1 as a MET responsive gene, which if knocked down in myoblasts leads to precocious myogenic differentiation. Similarly, cMetKO embryos, having reduced Slit1 expression, show greater myotomal differentiation and compact organization, compared to wildtype embryos. While Slit1 emerges as a MET target that represses precocious switch to myogenic differentiation, molecular intricacies of MET-mediated regulation of Slit1 and their spatio-temporal dynamic in fine-tuning myogenesis in the nascent limbs needs further examination.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

T.; Mlodzik, M.", "abstract": "Wingless (Wg)/Wnt signaling is critical throughout development and tissue homeostasis and associated with many disease states. Canonical Wg/Wnt-signaling is mediated by {beta}-catenin (Arm in Drosophila) with IFT-A/Kinesin-2 complex promoting nuclear translocation of {beta}-catenin/Arm upon pathway activation. Although IFT-A is essential for nuclear translocation of {beta}-catenin/Arm, existing data suggests additional proteins are involved in this process. Here, we have identified a novel, evolutionarily conserved protein, Pasovec (Psv), as a critical component required for nuclear {beta}-catenin/Arm localization. We demonstrate that Psv functionally interacts with the IFT-A/Kinesin2 complex and physically associates with IFT140, a core component of IFT-A. The Psv-IFT140 interaction is independent of Wg/Wnt-signaling activation. Importantly, Psv contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), which is critical for its own nuclear localization and that of {beta}-catenin/Arm upon Wg/Wnt-signaling activation. Psv with a mutated NLS can act as an inhibitor of Wg/Wnt-signaling.

Despite both diseases being rare, there are already 930 distinct missense variants in ABCC6 reported, 87% of which are of uncertain clinical significance (VUS). New approaches are needed to interpret and classify these VUS mechanistically. Methods We developed 3D protein models of ABCC6 in three functionally relevant conformations to calculate the structural effects of variants and identify 3D mutational hotspots. With this and additional functional information, we categorized variants in a mechanistic ontology based on which critical functions of ABCC6 they impact. We then compared PXE and GACI -associated variants. Results We identified two three-dimensional hotspots of pathogenic variants and six specific functions of ABCC6 which variants impact. From this, we propose a mechanism for pathogenicity for 41% of VUS according to their impacted function, 30 of which could be reclassified as Likely Pathogenic from our non-clinical data. Finally, we found slight differences between PXE and GACI-associated variants. Conclusion The mechanistic information we present will guide future research to better address calcification disorders and understand genetic variants.

Binding of GLP-1 to its cognate receptor on the beta cell surface results in induction of the cAMP signaling pathway, leading to the protein kinase A (PKA) mediated phosphorylation of CREB and induction of CREB target genes. By contrast with the acute effects of this pathway on immediate early CREB target genes, which attenuate the cAMP-CREB response, sustained exposure of beta cells to the stable GLP-1 receptor agonist Exendin-4 stimulates the expression of beta cell specific CREB target genes with delayed kinetics. In a proteomic screen for transcriptional co-regulators that mediate the long-term effects of GLP-1 analogs, we identified Med14, a backbone subunit of the Mediator complex. Exposure to Exendin-4 stimulates Med14 phosphorylation at Ser983, corresponding to a conserved PKA recognition site (RRXS) that is located within an intrinsically disordered region of Med14. Phosphorylation of Med14 by PKA is essential for maintenance of enhancers that drive induction of beta cell-specific and diabetes-linked genes. Mutation of Med14 at Ser983 to alanine decreased beta cell numbers and repressed Exendin-4 induced gene regulation in primary mouse beta cells.

Multi-omics dissection revealed complementary mechanisms: NR2F1 re-engaged chromatin-remodeling and cytoskeletal networks, whereas NR2F6, via a conserved corepressor domain, imposed a broad translational down-shift, bound predominantly to distal enhancers and re-packaged chromatin into new topologically associating domains that cluster growth genes with freshly activated regulatory hubs.

The Cagarras Island Archipelago Natural Monument, located near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, serves as nesting site for two species, the magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens) and the brown booby (Sula leucogaster). Despite its ecological importance, no prior studies have investigated viral infections in these species, which share habitat interfaces with densely populated human areas. To address this gap, we sampled and tested seabirds for CoVs and IAVs from January 2022 to April 2024. Birds were captured and identified by species, age, and sex. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, as well as blood samples, were collected. Viral RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and the presence of IAVs was screened via real-time RT-PCR, while CoVs were screened using semi-nested RT-PCR. Sanger and metatranscriptomic sequencing were performed to identify viral strains and assess phylogenetic relationships. Of the 153 seabirds sampled, CoVs were detected in 6 individuals (9.1%) of F. magnificens and 16 individuals (18.4%) of S. leucogaster. No IAVs were found in either oropharyngeal or cloacal swabs, and all serum samples were negative for the presence of antibodies against the virus. We recovered two full deltacoronavirus genomes and eight additional draft genomes from S. leucogaster samples obtained from distinct sampling expeditions and additional enteroviruses, passeriviruses, and picornaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the detected CoVs are closely related to avian deltacoronaviruses from environmental samples of S. leucogaster in the Sao Pedro and Sao Paulo Archipelago, indicating potential viral exchange between these seabird populations living at these distant islands. Moreover, multiple detections in different individuals at different time points are associated with specific Spike NTD deletions that have been shown to accumulate in immune escape lineages, supporting the long-term maintenance through new infections and reinfection of this virus in these bird populations.

Here, we characterize tomato AFP3, which produces two isoforms: a full-length protein and a shorter microProtein (sAFP3) containing only the C-terminal domain. Functional analyses reveal contrasting roles of these isoforms in development; while AFP3 overexpression accelerates shoot growth but impairs seed germination, both afp3 loss-of-function and sAFP3-expressing mutants (afp3-D) exhibit stunted growth and developmental defects. Transcriptome profiling highlights that AFP3 and sAFP3 differentially regulate hormone-related pathways, including salicylic acid, gibberellic acid, and jasmonic acid metabolism. Proteomic interaction studies demonstrate that AFP3 and sAFP3 physically interact, sharing partners involved in hormone signaling. Hormone quantification confirms that AFP3 modulates multiple phytohormones, with elevated ABA in afp3-D mutants and increased gibberellic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid in both afp3 and afp3-D mutant backgrounds. Moreover, AFP3 controls flower and fruit development, influencing yield and ripening. Together, these findings identify AFP3 as a key integrator of hormonal crosstalk that coordinates growth, development, and stress responses in tomato. The production of dual AFP3 isoforms through alternative transcription, combined with microProtein-mediated dominant-negative regulation, reveals a sophisticated mechanism for dynamically fine-tuning transcriptional networks.

Genetic circuits are being designed, built, and tested in plants to demonstrate proof of concept. However, developing these components in monocots, which the world relies on for grain, lags behind dicot models, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Here, we show the successful adaptation of a ligand-inducible sensor to activate an endogenous anthocyanin pathway in the C4 monocot model Setaria viridis. We identify two transcription factors sufficient to induce endogenous anthocyanin production in S. viridis protoplasts and whole plants in a constitutive or ligand-inducible manner. We also test multiple ligands to overcome physical barriers to ligand uptake, identifying triamcinolone acetonide (TA) as a highly potent inducer of this system. Using hyperspectral imaging and a discriminative target characterization method in a near-remote configuration, we can non-destructively detect anthocyanin production in leaves in response to ligands. This work demonstrates the use of inducible expression systems in monocots to manipulate endogenous pathways, stimulating plants to overproduce secondary metabolites with value to human health.

To adapt, plants have evolved diverse mechanisms to withstand heat stress (HS), minimizing potential damage and ensuring survival. One such adaptation is acquired thermotolerance (AT), where prior exposure to HS primes plants to withstand subsequent severe HS. AT can persist for several days and involves a recovery period during which plants establish heat stress memory (HSM), reorganize cellular processes, and strengthen stress resilience. The molecular mechanisms underlying HSM remain the subject of active investigation. In this study, we employ a high-throughput comparative multi-omics approach to unravel the transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings during distinct intervals of the HSM phase. Our findings provide insights into the intricacies of HS recovery and the memory process. Notably, distinct temporal responses emerge at both the transcriptional and protein levels during the early and late recovery phases. Transcripts associated with HSM are upregulated during the early HS recovery phase, indicating a rapid response crucial for initial memory formation, while corresponding protein levels remain elevated throughout the recovery period, supporting memory consolidation. Additionally, metabolite profiles reveal distinctive patterns across the HS memory phase. This marks the first detailed multi-omic analysis of the HSM phase in Arabidopsis seedlings, providing insights into the multifaceted nature of this complex process. These comprehensive datasets hold promise in elucidating regulators of HS resilience, thereby enhancing efforts in breeding HS-tolerant crops", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

In addition to specific expression of transcription factors and polar distribution of auxin, vesicular trafficking-mediated endomembrane dynamics are critical for zygotic division and embryonic patterning. As key regulators of vesicular trafficking, whether Rab GTPases play a role in these processes is unclear. We report that Arabidopsis guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors for Rab (RabGDIs) are essential for the asymmetric division of zygotes and embryonic patterning likely through regulating the dynamic targeting of canonical Rab GTPases, especially Rab5. Arabidopsis RabGDIs specifically interact with canonical Rab GTPases. Functional loss of Arabidopsis RabGDI1 and RabGDI2 compromises the asymmetry of zygotic division, cell fate determination, and embryonic patterning. Polar distribution of vacuolar dynamics was disrupted in zygotes and 1-cell embryo of gdi1 gdi2, suggesting a key role of RabGDIs in vacuolar dynamics. Furthermore, genetic interference of canonical Rab5, a key regulator of vacuolar trafficking and biogenesis, in zygotes leads to similar defects, consistent with the disturbed localization of Rab5 in gdi1 gdi2 embryos.

We isolated early-heading mutant line GB-10 (flowers around two to three weeks early in the field). Under long-day (LD) conditions, GB-10 flowered approximately two weeks earlier than GB. Under short-day conditions, the heading date between GB-10 and GB plants shows no apparent difference. In agreement with the heading date, Hd3a and RFT1 expressions show around a 10-time relative transcript quantity difference under LD conditions in GB-10 compared to GB. Interestingly, Ghd7 expression was significantly reduced in GB-10, which may trigger the Hd3a and RFT1 activation.

We performed transcriptomic analysis of five pollen developmental stages isolated from plants under normal and heat stress (H) conditions; uni-nuclear (UN), early bi-cellular (EB), bi-cellular (BC), tri-cellular (TC), and mature pollen (MPG). We show that the majority of genes that are up- or down-regulated under HS are specific for each stage, except BC stage that also exhibited the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (>4000). This emphasize a complex, stage-dependent heat stress response, possibly dependent on HSP levels. Additionally, promoter motif analysis revealed that heat shock elements (HSEs) exhibit a stage-specific pattern of enrichment, which peaked in MP. To explore stage-specific influences of HSP90s in pollen development, we characterized a knockdown RNAi line, under normal and stress conditions in early- and late-stage RNAi lines using stage-specific promoters pJASON (JA90R) and pLAT52 (L90R). The hsp90 background leads to lower germination rate in both RNAi lines that is more pronounced under heat stress caused by significant alterations in heat stress control via impaired ABA signalling or ER stress response. Heat stress conditions also lead to a high percentage of nuclei shape and orientation defects in the L90R line pollen, pointing to the higher sensitivity of late stage development. We show this defect is linked to the down-regulation of DNA metabolism genes.

R.; Page, J.; Gomez Lencero, R.", "abstract": "The primary cilium, a solitary and non-motile extension of the plasma membrane, has recently been identified in adult male mouse spermatocytes. However, very little is known about when these cilia emerge during testicular maturation and what their function is. In the context of fertility establishment during puberty, this study investigates the dynamics of ciliogenesis in prepubertal mouse spermatocytes. Our findings reveal that primary cilia are not an intrinsic feature of spermatocytes during the first wave of meiosis, which initiates at 8 days post-partum (dpp). Instead, cilia begin polymerizing at 20 dpp, after first meiotic wave has been completed, and are present in spermatocytes across all stages of prophase I. Thus, no direct correlation between cilia polymerization and the initiation of synapsis or desynapsis was found, although chemical ablation of cilia may delay DNA repair during prophase I. Typical adult cilia features, which are shorter and restricted to zygotene spermatocytes, are settled upon acquisition of sexual maturity. This study also highlights that the emergence of ciliated spermatocytes in prepuberal mice coincides with the onset of flagellogenesis, hinting at a potential link between the regulation of the formation of both types of axonemes within the tissue developing environment. Proteomic analyses further identify temporal regulators of axoneme assembly, providing valuable targets for future research to unravel the molecular pathways underlying ciliogenesis, flagellogenesis, and their roles in spermatogenesis. We explored distinct regulatory mechanisms of ciliogenesis during the first meiotic wave and found that Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is a critical regulator of cilia disassembly during late diplotene, with evidence suggesting that centrosome migration and cilia depolymerization are mutually exclusive events during meiosis. In summary, this study provides the first detailed characterization of primary cilia dynamics during early testicular maturation in mice, revealing their spatiotemporal regulation, candidate molecular mediators, and potential roles during meiosis. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding the physiological relevance of meiotic cilia in spermatogenesis and testicular development.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

With the advent of long-read sequencing, Nanopore-based metabarcoding represents a promising alternative to short-read approaches. Due to the limited number of available studies, the effectiveness of Nanopore sequencing - alone or in combination with short-read data - for assessing the biodiversity and ecological patterns of protists in different ecosystems is not yet sufficiently explored. Here we present BaNaNA (Barcoding Nanopore Neat Annotator), a pipeline designed to generate high-quality OTUs and abundance estimates from Nanopore sequencing data. The performance of the pipeline was evaluated using a mock community as well as on marine and freshwater environmental samples to demonstrate its relevance for protist biodiversity and ecological studies. Our results show that BaNaNA generates high-quality full-length 18S rDNA OTUs from Nanopore long reads that are directly comparable to short-read V4-18S rDNA ASVs, supporting their synergistic use in long-term biodiversity studies. While both approaches reveal similar overall community diversity, long-read OTUs provide greater taxonomic resolution, richer phylogenetic information enabling the discovery of new clades, and yield fewer false positives. These advantages make long-read Nanopore metabarcoding not only a powerful complement but also a reliable replacement to short-read methods.

We investigated whether preference for intermediate complexity is unique to humans or shared with other species. We compared the acoustic preferences of humans and budgerigars, known for their vocal learning and pattern recognition abilities, using a three-option place preference paradigm. Participants were presented with choices between computationally well-defined stimuli varying in complexity: pitch sequences with tones arranged either randomly (high complexity), into repeating patterns with changes (medium), or into a fully repetitive pattern (low). Our results demonstrate that both humans and budgerigars prefer stimuli with intermediate complexity, spontaneously exhibiting an inverted U-shape relationship between complexity and preference without any specific goal or external reward. Because a U-shape relationship has been argued to maximize learning, this preference may be of potential utility for vocal learning, however, further testing could determine whether it is also present for acoustic patterns in vocal non-learning species. Because vertebrates show inverted U-shape responses in a variety of non-auditory contexts, our findings may be rooted in general processes, but may depend on vocal learning to translate to acoustic contexts. This provides exciting opportunities to further investigate the fundamentals of vocal learning within and beyond the auditory and/or musical domain.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate convergence in the contact calls of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) that we introduced and experimentally housed together. To estimate and disentangle the roles of kinship, co-housing (familiarity), allogrooming, and food sharing in predicting call similarity, we first measured call similarity using 35 features of 565,557 contact calls from 94 bats, then fit a series of Bayesian generalized multi-membership models. We also measured changes in call similarity for a subset of individuals that were recorded before and after co-housing. We found that co-housing caused vocal convergence. Furthermore, food-sharing rates among familiar nonkin within the same co-housed group predicted contact call similarity. This finding suggests that the development of cooperative relationships causes further vocal convergence beyond the initial convergence caused by co-housing.

To search for host factors or processes essential for PM pathogenesis, a tailored genetic screen was conducted with the immuno-compromised eds1-2/pad4-1/sid2-2 (eps) triple Arabidopsis mutant. This led to the identification of five allelic disruptive mutations in Mildew Locus O 2 (MLO2) to be responsible for the compromised-immunity-yet-poor infection (cipi) mutant phenotype upon challenge from an adapted PM isolate. Moreover, the eds1/pad4/sid2/mlo2/mlo6/mlo12 (eps3m) sextuple mutant display near complete immunity to the adapted PM fungus without sign of defense activation, demonstrating that these three clade V MLOs in Arabidopsis are bona fide host susceptibility factors of PM fungi. Confocal imaging revealed focal accumulation of MLO2- GFP in the peri-penetration peg membranous space, implicating MLO2 in repairing and stabilizing the damaged host plasma membrane, which may be co-opted by PM fungi for haustorium differentiation. Results from domain-swapping analysis between MLO1 and MLO2 suggest a bipartite functional configuration for MLO2: its C-terminus determines where and when MLO2 functions, while its N-terminal seven transmembrane domain region executes the cellular function that is critical for PM pathogenesis. Genetic studies further demonstrate that, unlike MLO7 in synergids, focal accumulation of MLO2 does not depend on FERONIA (FER) and its five other family members, nor does it require phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate produced from phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase 1 (PIP5K1) and PIP5K2.

Soybean typically has compound leaves with three leaflets each, but a spontaneous mutation, designated lf2, possesses seven leaflets, offering a means to dissect the molecular mechanisms specifying leaflet number and assess its potential for soybean improvement. However, the developmental and genetic bases of the lf2 mutation remain unknown. Here, we characterize the seven-leaflet phenotype and identify the mutation responsible for the phenotypic changes. Microscopic examination of leaf emergence sites revealed that the seven-leaflet phenotype arises in a two-step process: five leaflets form initially followed by secondary leaflet initiation at the margins of the central leaflet. Genetic mapping delineated lf2 to a ~2.5 Mb region at the start of chromosome 11. Fortuitously, integration of pedigree analysis with comparative analysis of genomic sequences from the region pinpointed a 2-bp deletion in the coding sequence of a gene, which is homologous to the Arabidopsis KNAT7 encoding a KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX 2 transcription factor, as the sole candidate for Lf2. The deletion is predicted to result in disruption of the putative DNA-binding homeodomain. Expression of the wild-type allele of the candidate gene in the seven-leaflet lf2 mutant restored the three-leaflet phenotype, while disruption of the wild-type allele through CRISPR-Cas9 editing induced extra leaflet formation.

In this study, we identified homologs of XLG3 in Lotus japonicus responsive to rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiosis. However, these proteins were approximately one-third the size of conventional XLGs and only aligned to the N-terminal domain, containing a putative nuclear localization signal and a cysteine-rich domain of unknown function. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis determined these small XLGs (SXLGs) did not share domains with other mono- or heterotrimeric G-protein classes and exhibited a pattern of duplication and neofunctionalization typical of genes involved in symbiotic signaling pathways. Transient expression of LjSXLGs in tobacco demonstrated their potential for localization to the plasma membrane, nucleus, and nucleolus. Analysis of L. japonicus sxlg2 mutants revealed transient impairment of immature nodule formation in a destructive experimental setup and inhibition of infection events in a nutrient-limited non-destructive experimental setup, with a delayed onset of established infection events and a potential impact on nodule maturation rate.

The ER-independent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in axonal mitochondria is mediated by enriched MCU-regulating proteins, MICU1 and MICU2, while higher NCLX expression facilitates rapid Ca2+ clearance.

Paradoxically, CFs also excite molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), a cell-type that inhibits PCs and can restrict plasticity and learning. However, two types of MLIs with opposing influences have recently been identified: MLI1s inhibit PCs, reduce dendritic calcium signals, and suppress plasticity of granule cell to PC synapses, whereas MLI2s inhibit MLI1s and disinhibit PCs. To determine how CFs can activate MLIs without also suppressing the PC calcium signals necessary for plasticity and learning, we investigated the specificity of CF inputs onto MLIs. Serial EM reconstructions indicate that CFs contact both MLI subtypes without making conventional synapses, but more CFs contact each MLI2 via more sites with larger contact areas. Slice experiments indicate that CFs preferentially excite MLI2s via glutamate spillover. In agreement with these anatomical and slice experiments, in vivo Neuropixels recordings show that spontaneous CF activity excites MLI2s, inhibits MLI1s, and disinhibits PCs. In contrast, learning-related sensory stimulation produced more complex responses, driving convergent CF and granule cell inputs that could either activate or suppress MLI1s.

T.", "abstract": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), results from silencing of the FMR1 gene and consequent loss of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP deficiency disrupts neural development, leading to behavioral and motor deficits associated with striatal dysfunction. While structural and functional abnormalities in striatal projection neurons (SPNs) have been observed in adult Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, their developmental onset and contribution to early FXS pathophysiology remain unknown. In this study, we examined the postnatal maturation of SPN in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of Fmr1 KO mice, assessing glutamatergic synaptic inputs and intrinsic excitability. During postnatal development, Fmr1 deficient SPNs in DMS display normal synaptic and intrinsic properties, consistent with typical maturation. In contrast, by P60, SPNs of mice exhibit pronounced hyperexcitability, characterized by increased membrane resistance, reduced rheobase, and slower action potential kinetics. These perturbations affect both Dopamine 1 receptor-expressing (D1-SPN) and D2 receptor-expressing (D2-SPN) SPNs, though some action potential dynamics are selectively impaired in D1-SPNs. Chronic aripiprazole treatment, a widely prescribed therapy for FXS-related symptoms, fails to normalize SPN excitability, highlighting its limited efficacy in addressing core SPN dysfunction. Our findings reveal a late-onset hyperexcitability in DMS SPNs of Fmr1 KO mice, suggesting a progressive emergence of striatal neuron abnormalities over development. These results underscore the importance of developmental timing in FXS pathophysiology and emphasize the need for targeted interventions to address striatal circuit dysfunction.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Its interaction with tissue-enriched and sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) leads to distinct functional outputs in the given tissue by targeting a specific set of genes. However, how NuRD dynamically and specifically regulates gene expression in a tissue-specific manner is poorly understood. Here, we refine an N-terminal specific NuRD-interaction motif which enables direct engagement with many transcriptional regulatory proteins. Using a series of structural modelling and biochemical techniques, we show that ZNF512B, a poorly characterised neuronal-expressed zinc finger protein, directly binds to the RBBP4 subunit of the NuRD complex. Subsequent knockdown of ZNF512B results in the downregulation of several neural-related molecular pathways suggesting that ZNF512B may play a regulatory role during neurogenesis. We also show that in NTERA-2 neural cells, the expression of ZNF512B is necessary for cell growth and survival, and is markedly enhanced during neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation. In summary, our data suggest that ZNF512B might regulate neural-specific transcriptional programs via engagement with the NuRD complex.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

We propose that the principles of lexical connectivity, which words derive meaning from their contextual interactions, can be adapted to genetic data, enabling transformer models to reveal that individuals with higher genetic similarity form stronger latent connections. We explored this by transposing KING kinship-related matrices into the (query, key, value) QKV latent space within transformer models and determined that attention mechanisms can capture genetic relatedness in an unsupervised fashion. We found that individuals had an attention weight connectivity of 85.34% (p<0.05) if they were from within the same continent, compared to if they were from other continents. Surprisingly, we found that some encoder layers required inversion of their latent representations for this connectivity to become obvious. Lastly, we used BERTViz to create human-readable hyper-dense connectivity patterns among individuals. Our approach is purely based on attention, which yields a non-discrete spectrum of relatedness, and thus uncovers patterns on first principles. Seq2KING addresses the significant challenge of discovering population structures to construct a global human relatedness map, without relying on predefined labels.

We investigated their ecophysiological and molecular mechanisms through germination assays under salt and drought stress, combined with proteomic analysis. YP consistently showed the highest germination percentage (GP) and germination rate index (GRI) under stress, while PP displayed well germination success under low salinity and well-watered conditions (GP=32.7%, 36.7%; GRI=0.018, 0.020), but significantly impaired viability under stress (GP=12.7%, 12.0%; GRI=0.006, 0.006).

Using a conceptual modelling framework based on forest succession, we show that offsetting success hinges on two critical factors: the scale of habitat compensation and the duration of conservation commitments. We show that effective offsetting requires not only restoring areas larger than those impacted, but also sustaining conservation over timeframes that align with the ecological timescales of habitat development. Rapid habitat conversion consistently undermines offset success, particularly since the persistence and recovery of habitat-dependent, colonising species are highly sensitive to how quickly habitats are lost, how long restoration sites are protected, and how much time they need to reach sufficient habitat quality. Moreover, we show that short-term improvements do not necessarily meet long-term biodiversity targets. Given that habitat succession unfolds over decades or more, offset policies must move beyond short-term metrics. We emphasise that offsetting schemes must be scrutinized to ensure sufficient spatial compensation and time for habitat succession. Offsetting schemes should also account for different ecological indicators to avoid the ecological fallacy of short-term restoration success resulting in long-term biodiversity and ecosystem integrity loss.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

These persistence acidic vacuoles harbor bacterial subpopulations that resist to stress in a metabolically dormant state. Although LisCVs have been proposed as a hallmark of Lm persistence in epithelial cells, their prevalence across strains and the bacterial factors underlying their formation remain uncharacterized. Given the significant genetic diversity within the species, it is important to consider this variability when studying persistence phenotype. Therefore, we screened over one hundred Lm isolates spanning two major evolutionary lineages and belonging to 23 clonal complexes from diverse ecological origins. Strikingly, the vast majority of strains, including both clinical and environmental isolates, were capable of forming LisCVs, suggesting that vacuolar persistence is a widespread and conserved feature of Lm pathogenesis. Nevertheless, among the group of hypo-virulent strains mostly associated with food and carrying a truncated InlA, we identified four isolates with an altered persistence phenotype. Two of them showed defects in the early stages of infection and carried mutations in key virulence genes (hly and gshF). The other two, instead, were specifically affected in the persistence by showing a reduced ability to form LisCVs. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that a mutation in the folP gene, required for folate biosynthesis, was responsible for impaired persistence. Live-imaging and microscopy analysis highlighted a reduced bacterial motility and intercellular spreading of the folP mutant, although the level of ActA at the bacterial surface was increased. Together, our work identifies folate biosynthesis as a critical metabolic pathway governing Lm persistence by regulating ActA levels and activity. Downregulation of ActA at the bacterial surface is therefore a crucial event for the establishment of the intracellular persistent niche during long-term infection of epithelial cells.\n\nAuthor SummaryLong regarded as a strictly cytosolic pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes is now revealing a dual lifestyle that includes intracellular vacuoles. Recent evidence shows that in epithelial cells this bacterium can enter a dormant state within acidic vacuoles, termed LisCVs, potentially contributing to silent carriage and antibiotic treatment failure. Here, we reveal that vacuolar persistence is a widespread and conserved feature among diverse Listeria strains.

B.; Macedo Silva, T.; Kalia, I.; Lack, J. B.; Desai, S. A.", "abstract": "To grow and replicate in erythrocytes, malaria parasites must increase the host cells permeability to a broad range of nutrients. The plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC) mediates this increased permeability and has been linked to CLAG3, a protein encoded by a multigene family conserved in Plasmodium spp. Surprisingly, an CLAG3 knockout parasite produced in P. falciparum exhibits incomplete reductions in PSAC activity, propagates normally in standard nutrient-rich media, but is unable to expand in modified media with more physiological levels of key nutrients. To explore these unexpected findings, we used in vitro selections on a CLAG3-null parasite and obtained a mutant capable of expansion under nutrient-limiting conditions. This growth was associated with restored solute uptake despite absence of CLAG3 protein. The mutant parasite expressed channels with characteristics of PSAC though with altered solute selectivity and lack of protease susceptibility, suggesting a modified channel and genome-level changes in the pathogen. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a dramatically increased clag2 copy number without other relevant changes. Quantitative PCR and DNA transfection confirmed increased production of the clag2 gene product. These findings implicate CLAG2 in direct formation of nutrient channels, suggest a new model that accounts for variable expansion of clag genes in Plasmodium spp., and uncover a dramatic genome plasticity available to malaria parasites.\n\nAuthor SummaryMalaria parasites grow within circulating red blood cells and acquire nutrients from human and animal plasma via a pore they insert in the host membrane. This pore is linked to CLAG3, a protein conserved in all examined malaria parasites. Surprisingly, deletion of CLAG3 only partially reduces formation of the nutrient pores, allowing parasites to grow normally under standard culture conditions that provide high levels of nutrients. This CLAG3-null parasite could not grow in modified media with two nutrients reduced to levels resembling those in human plasma. Here, we used prolonged culture of the CLAG3-null parasite in nutrient-limited medium to produce a mutant that can grow at near-normal rates. Despite its inability to express CLAG3, this mutant increased its nutrient uptake using pores with altered properties. Molecular studies revealed DNA-level amplification of the gene encoding CLAG2, a closely related protein from another parasite chromosome. Our findings suggest that the human malaria parasite can change its DNA to increase nutrient uptake and grow in malnourished hosts.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Upon infecting dendritic cells (DCs), Toxoplasma induces a hypermigratory phenotype characterized by podosome dissolution and formation of F-actin stress fibers. We previously showed that these cytoskeletal changes depend on the effector protein Toxoplasma WAVE complex-interacting protein (TgWIP) secreted from parasites to infected leukocytes. Here, we identify the host adaptor proteins Non-catalytic region of tyrosine kinase adaptor protein 1 and 2 (Nck1/2) and Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) as direct TgWIP interactors. TgWIP mainly uses two distinct proline-rich regions (PRRs) to interact with Nck1 and Grb2. Mutating these PRRs abrogates TgWIP binding to Nck1 and Grb2 and diminishes podosome dissolution and DC hypermotility. Furthermore, we show that TgWIP directly interacts with the actin nucleation promoting factor WAVE Regulatory Complex (WRC) via a WRC-interacting receptor sequence (WIRS). Disrupting this interaction also influences actin cytoskeletal remodeling and DC hypermotility. Collectively, our data reveal that TgWIP directly interacts with multiple actin regulators, including Nck1, Grb2, and the WRC, to remodel the actin cytoskeleton of the host cells, elucidating a key mechanism that Toxoplasma exploits to enhance host cell migration and dissemination.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Precipitation changes will increase fluctuations in surface soil salinity, and the same happens for thawed permafrost soil where stable salt concentrations are replaced with fluctuating salinity during annual freeze-thaw cycles. Both have unknown effects on the microbial communities and their emissions of microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs). These compounds are produced from various pathways mainly as secondary metabolites and have ecological and climatic implications when released into the environment and the atmosphere. Thus, it is important to explore the effects of environmental changes, such as changes in salinity, on soil microbial communities and their MVOC emissions. Here, we characterize the MVOC production of three novel bacterial isolates from northern Greenland throughout their growth period under low, moderate, and high salt concentrations. We demonstrate that salinity significantly alters both the quantity and composition of MVOCs emitted by all three strains, including changes in the emissions of sulphur- and nitrogen-containing compounds, potentially leading to ecosystem nutrient loss. The observed changes in MVOC profiles suggest that changes in soil salinity due to climate change could alter microbial metabolism and MVOC emissions, with potential implications for Arctic nutrient cycling and atmospheric chemistry.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

The global surge in obesity, driven by industrialization and the widespread consumption of low-fiber, ultra-processed food, highlights an urgent need for deeper biological insights. While the gut microbiome has been studied in the context of obesity, the contribution of the oral microbiome-the second largest microbial ecosystem in the human body-remains largely underexplored. Here, we report findings from a deeply-phenotyped prospective-cohort of 628 Emirati adults, leveraging amplicon sequencing of mouthwash samples and multi-omics profiling and functional and metabolic activity analysis of 97 obese individuals and 95 matched controls, making this the most comprehensive multi-omics analysis of the oral microbiome. We identified significant differences in oral microbial diversity, composition, functional pathways, and metabolic profiles between obese and non-obese groups. Integrated multi-omics analysis of the 192 matched metagenomes and metabolome samples uncovered significant metabolic reprogramming and altered energy regulation in obesity. Specifically, the oral microbiome of obese participants were enriched for the proinflammatory Streptococcus parasanguinis and Actinomyces oris, and the lactate-producing Oribacterium sinus. Many microbial pathways involved in dietary carbohydrate metabolism, histidine degradation, as well as the production of obesogenic biomolecules were also enriched in obese participants; however, B-vitamin and heme production pathways were depleted. Consequently, metabolites resulting from these pathways such as lactate, histidine derivatives, choline, uridine, and uracil were elevated in obesity. These consistent microbiome-metabolite shifts were strongly associated with prominent obesity-associated cardiometabolic markers, including serum triglycerides and alkaline phosphatases, establishing a robust link between oral microbiome and obesity. These findings provide the most comprehensive insights into how disrupted microbial-metabolic cross-talk in the oral cavity may contribute to obesity and related cardiometabolic disease risk, underscoring the potential of targeting of oral microbiome-host interactions as a novel avenue for obesity prevention and intervention.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

In this study, we identified and characterised food derived Pseudomonas isolates capable of inhibiting Salmonella growth in vitro and in planta. The identified isolates were active against a range of Salmonella serovars, and additionally E. coli isolates derived from food. We demonstrated that dynamics of the interaction between Pseudomonas and Salmonella are environment and application dependant. To uncover the mechanisms Pseudomonas employs to suppress Salmonella, we used transcriptomics coupled with pathway analysis in the two different settings. We showed that Pseudomonas metabolism undergoes significant environment-specific changes in the presence of Salmonella, implicating different pathways responsible for the control of the pathogen in the two different settings.

Using barcode sequencing to track strain frequencies over time, we compete strains with perturbed expression dynamics to assess the strength of selection on gene expression levels. We reveal that expression levels can be shaped to enhance phenotypic memory of past environmental states, reducing the impact of lag phases on long-term population growth. By independently perturbing the ability to sense the environment and the control of expression levels, we discover sign epistasis between sensing and control in a gene regulatory network, and identify its molecular underpinnings.

Aberrant activation of this pathway is associated with tumorigenesis, and several PI3K inhibitors have been developed as anti-cancer agents. Emerging evidence suggests that viruses, including {beta}-coronaviruses, have evolved mechanisms to exploit host PI3K signaling for their replication and immune evasion. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of a panel of PI3K inhibitors against {beta}-coronaviruses, including mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), human OC43 (HuCoV-OC43) and four major SARS-CoV-2 variants using both cell line and organoid models. Our findings reveal that these compounds exhibit low micromolar potency in inhibiting viral replication. Notably, the inhibitor C20 (PWT33597) demonstrated broad-spectrum activity against multiple {beta}-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, MHV, and HuCoV-OC43, in conventional cell lines as well as in air--liquid interface (ALI)-cultured, differentiated primary human nasal and bronchial epithelial cells. Given that cytokine storm is a major contributor to SARS-CoV-2--related multi-organ failure and mortality, we further explored the impact of PI3K inhibition on host inflammatory responses. We found that MHV infection markedly increased cytokine expression in 17CL-1 fibroblasts and RAW264.7 macrophages. Interestingly, treatment with C20 further amplified cytokine production in this context, suggesting complex immunomodulatory effects that warrant further investigation. Together, our findings support the therapeutic potential of repurposing PI3K inhibitors as broad-spectrum antivirals.

Yet, light also acts as a sensory cue, directly and indirectly affecting insect pests and their natural enemies. Despite growing interest, the impacts of LEDs on multitrophic interactions remain poorly understood. This study assessed how spectral photoperiod extension modulates top-down effects (predator effects on pest densities, pest-related damage to plants, and plant defense-related gene expression) and bottom-up effects (plant morphology, light assimilation, and defense as well as growth hormone-related gene expression) in a tri-trophic system involving a plant, Cucumis sativus (greenhouse cucumber), a pest insect, Frankliniella occidentalis (western flower thrips), and a predator used for biological control, Orius insidiosus. Plants were exposed for two weeks to a 12-hour artificial sunlight simulating a cloudy winter day, with or without an 8-hour extension of blue, blue-red, or blue-green-red LEDs. Orius insidiosus reduced thrips populations by 96% {+/-} 9%, regardless of light treatment, and decreased foliar damage due to thrips by 46% on average. Predators produced offspring under all lighting conditions, although total numbers of O. insidiosus were lower under blue-green-red lighting. Pest densities remained similar across all light treatments, suggesting that light supplementation did not benefit F. occidentalis. Blue and blue-red spectra improved plant light assimilation, and photoperiod extension generally increased dry biomass (8% {+/-} 11%). Defense-related phytohormones were only marginally affected; surprisingly, some jasmonic acid pathway-related genes were upregulated in the presence of predators, suggesting additional plant-mediated effects.

The lack of harvest data is of particular concern in the case of birds occurring on islands. Resident species on islands often exhibit limited geographic ranges and inherently small population sizes, rendering them particularly susceptible to environmental and anthropogenic threats. Islands also support seasonally fluctuating populations of migratory species, providing essential habitats for stopovers and non-breeding periods. Within this context, the sustainability of gamebird harvest practiced on islands within a regulatory framework needs to be evaluated to inform management and prevent negative impacts on populations. Here, we present a case study of an island-wide assessment of bird hunting estimates, based on data available from a legal hunting program, in Martinique, a tropical oceanic island part of the Caribbean biodiversity hotspot. Our objectives were to determine the magnitude of gamebird harvest, track changes in harvest levels over time, and assess harvest sustainability. Our assessment, which is based on hunting logbooks and hunter surveys between the 2012-2013 and 2021-2022 hunting seasons, provides harvest estimates for two groups of migratory species, shorebirds (Charadriidae, Scolopacidae) and teals (Anatidae), and two groups of resident species (Columbidae and Mimidae). In Martinique, harvest management measures, combined with increased hunter's engagement and enforcement of regulations, has led more stringent harvest regulations, improved compliance from hunters, and a reduction of Martinique's national shorebird harvest. However, considering continued and rapid shorebirds population declines across the Western Atlantic flyway, shorebird harvest assessment at the flyway level remains a priority", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Viruses accounted for 0.089% (357,161 reads) of mapped reads across 2,084 taxa. Virus communities differ between lakes and marine sites, with lakes dominated by Caudoviricetes and marine environments featuring Caudoviricetes and Algavirales. Each time series shows compositional changes in virus communities from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, supporting the inference that sedaDNA can reconstruct time-resolved ancient viral assemblages. Among the most abundant viruses, we identified 83 virus-host pairs known from published literature to infect bacterial, archaeal, or eukaryotic hosts, and assessed their associations using co-variation patterns. Over millennia, virus-host co-variations are particularly stable in marine systems, especially for phytoplankton-infecting viruses. However, in the Bering Sea, we find a lack of virus-host correlation, likely because an Arctic Pelagibacter strain expanded rapidly after the Bering Strait opened, potentially due to absent viral infection. Antagonistic patterns also appear between bacteriophages and hosts, possibly linked to shifts between lytic and lysogenic cycles in response to environmental changes.

Spatial transcriptomics identified interleukin-34 production by breast cancer cells inducing ARG1+ macrophages at the invading edge of the metastasis. Treatment with a blocking antibody to the receptor for interleukin-34, CSF1R, produced tumor shrinkage. These findings have immediate translation potential as a CSF1R-blocking antibody is FDA-approved. Further, it demonstrates that cancer-associated inflammation bordering the brain metastasis promotes metastatic growth and offers a molecularly targeted strategy to treat inflammation in brain metastasis.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

While recent pharmacological interventions primarily aim to reduce food intake, enhancing energy expenditure in adipose tissue offers a promising complementary approach. In this study, we identify that SP16, a synthetic -1-antitrypsin derived peptide, is a novel GIP (gastric inhibitory peptide) receptor agonist. SP16 promotes lipolysis via the cAMP pathway, resulting in increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption in adipocytes. Furthermore, SP16 binds to the insulin receptor, and at high concentrations, it attenuates insulin receptor signaling. In diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, acute SP16 treatment improved glucose clearance, elevated circulating free fatty acids, and decreased leptin levels. Ex vivo analyses of epididymal white adipose tissue corroborated these findings, demonstrating enhanced lipolysis in SP16-treated mice. In conclusion, SP16 emerges as a novel lipolytic peptide with beneficial metabolic effects.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

In this basic physiology study, we used a uniquely designed collection protocol of urine collection to characterize with great detail the variation of uEVs excretion and cargo throughout a 24-hour period in healthy subjects. Thirteen healthy adults (9 F, 4 M) collected every individual void over 24 hours (average of 7.2 +/- 1.6 voids per individual). An artificial 24 hr sample was generated for each collection to compare individual void variation to. uEVs were enriched by low-speed centrifugation with three low-ionic-strength washes to minimize Tamm-Horsfall protein. Size and concentration were quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA); morphology by cryo-TEM; cargo by immunoblotting (NCC, AQP2, TSG101) and single-particle flow cytometry (CD9, CD10, DPP4, Neprilysin). Dietary intake was recorded in nine participants. uEV concentrations varied up to 100-fold across the day, but differences between five predefined time blocks were not significant (p = 0.622). Median uEV diameter ranged from 94 nm to 220 nm without significant diurnal change (p = 0.150). uEV counts correlated strongly with urine creatinine (r = 0.70, p < 0.001), specific gravity (r = 0.65, p < 0.001), and TSG101 signal (r = 0.61, p < 0.001). NCC abundance showed a near-significant mid-day dip (p = 0.06), while AQP2 trended higher in the afternoon (p = 0.27); no temporal pattern was detected for CD9, CD10, DPP4, or Neprilysin. Higher urine flow rates trended toward lower uEV excretion. Food-log data suggested larger uEVs with greater fluid intake, but statistical power was limited. In healthy adults, uEV concentration, size, and most cargo markers exhibit substantial intra-day variability without consistent circadian peaks, whereas NCC and AQP2 show reproducible diurnal trends. Creatinine and TSG101 were used as normalization factors under stable renal function. These findings offer foundational insights into uEV excretion patterns over the course of a day and emphasize key methodological considerations essential for advancing uEV biomarker research.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Many studies have addressed the roles of the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala in the storage of the fear engram, but the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), especially during and immediately after fear acquisition, remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we longitudinally recorded ACC neuronal activity using single-photon calcium imaging in freely behaving adult male mice subjected to fear conditioning. Subjects acquired a conditioned freezing response to a tone cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) paired with light foot shocks (unconditioned stimulus, US), and ACC activity was monitored during cue pre-exposure, fear acquisition, fear recall, and fear extinction. Consistent with known functions of the ACC, neuronal responses were modulated by the US and by the novelty of the CS and US. Critically, both the number of CS-responsive neurons and the CS-associated population activity rose during acquisition, peaked during recall, and decreased throughout extinction. Neuronal populations responsive to the CS overlapped at a rate consistent with chance, suggesting that the ACC operates as a flexible integrative hub rather than containing stable engrams. Together, these findings indicate that ACC neuronal populations, but not engrams, represent novelty, pain, and the dynamic valence of a CS. Our findings are consistent with a model in which the ACC plays a role in threat appraisal and provides a learning signal that dynamically updates fear representations in other regions.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we depict a complexity of interactions in a cross-kingdom consortia of Bacillus velezensis and Trichoderma guizhouense. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that in the presence of fungi, the key stress sigma factor of B. velezensis activates expression of biosynthetic genes for antimicrobial secondary metabolite production. Among these, surfactin induces T22azaphilone production in T. guizhouense that hinders oxidative stress. Both surfactin and T22azaphilone contribute to Bacillus and Trichoderma maintenance in soil in the presence of FOC. Finally, FOC-secreted fusaric acid temporarily inhibits B. velezensis growth while it is efficiently degraded by T. guizhouense.

L.; Susilo, C. T.; Rodolf, A. A.; Ivanov, T.; Corrales, E. M.; Kumar, S. S.; Kamariza, M.", "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the most lethal cause of death from a single infectious agent. In 2024, an estimated 10 million people developed TB, nearly half a million of which were infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB). Early detection of infection and drug resistance is critical to controlling DR-TB as this enables rapid engagement into effective care. Currently, bacterial culture and nucleic acid testing remain the primary methods for diagnosing infection, with smear microscopy being phased out. However, these methods present significant limitations for diagnosing drug resistance such as lengthy time-to-result for phenotypic tests, as well as the need for prior knowledge of resistance mutations and prohibitive cost for molecular tests. To address this, we developed a rapid phenotypic TB drug susceptibility test, termed Tre-DST, based on novel trehalose probes, which upon metabolic conversion emit enhanced fluorescence signal, giving them their unique ability to specifically detect live mycobacteria. We used the nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis and the virulence-attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Ra or auxotrophic Mtb to demonstrate a strong correlation between cost-effective plate reader results and flow cytometry data, suggesting the fluorescence plate reader is a suitable fluorescence detector for Tre-DST. We determined that adding a one-week incubation step for Mtb allowed samples originally seeded at 10 CFU/mL to become detectable, over two weeks earlier than colony forming unit analysis. Importantly, we found that Tre-DST reports on drug susceptibility in a drug-agnostic manner, demonstrating loss of fluorescence with frontline TB drugs rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), and ethambutol, as well as the newer drug bedaquiline. Finally, Tre-DST distinguished RIF- and INH-resistant auxotrophs from susceptible controls and accurately reported resistance activity. Ultimately, because Tre-DST is agnostic to mechanisms of drug resistance, this assay is likely compatible with all WHO-recommended DR-TB drugs as well as any future TB drugs as a diagnostic in reference laboratories.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that the bacteria use filamentation as a novel cell-to-cell spreading mechanism once inside the intestinal cell. However, how the bacteria invade the host cells and what factors contribute to B. atropi infection process remain unknown. In this study, we investigate the roles of type III (T3SS) and type VI secretion systems (T6SS) in B. atropi pathogenesis, which are employed by many bacterial pathogens, both extracellular and intracellular, to deliver effectors that manipulate host physiology to their advantage. We found that the two T6SSs encoded in B. atropi genome played no obvious roles in the invasion or intracellular spreading. In contrast, a T3SS was required for intestinal cell invasion. T3SS mutants showed loss of host cell protrusions from the apical surface that normally engulf invading wild type bacteria, as seen by both electron microscopy and confocal fluorescent microscopy. These protrusions bear morphological similarities to membrane ruffles triggered by the T3SS-mediated invasion seen in other pathogens such as Salmonella and Shigella spp. Additionally, we conducted dual transcriptomics and saw upregulation of T3SS in vivo, along with several putative effectors and the virulence regulator BvgS of the genus Bordetellae. We knocked out these effector candidates and found that deletion of one of these genes, deiA (deficient/decreased invasion gene A), leads to a reduction in the number of invasion events and overall percentage of infected animals in the population. In addition, deletion of the virulence regulator bvgS resulted in a complete loss of B. atropi invasion, suggesting it may regulate T3SS for host cell invasion.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the pathogenicity and transmission efficiency of three recent clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses isolated from a bovine, mountain lion, and a human case using Syrian hamsters. Intranasal inoculation with 104 TCID50 resulted in productive virus replication in the respiratory tract and shedding for all three isolates. Transmission studies showed limited efficiency via direct contact and airborne routes for all three isolates. Although overall transmission was inefficient, the human H5N1 isolate demonstrated relatively greater contact transmissibility than the bovine and mountain lion isolates.

We have established distinct mechanistic roles for the essential elongation factors PAF1, NELF, SPT5, SPT6, and the Super Elongaiton Complex (SEC) via acute depletion of each individually in auxin-inducible degron lines. Here, we leverage these degron lines to explore the regulatory intersection of transcription elongation control and pre-mRNA processing. Integrating long- and short-read RNA-seq data to quantify transcript isoform usage at single-molecule resolution, we identify elongation factor-specific RNA processing regulons including a cellular senescence-enriched regulon shared by NELF and SPT6. We then show that long-term depletion of NELF or SPT6 results in reversible growth arrest following early upregulation of a small group of genes, which include the senescence-associated genes CDKN1A (p21) and CCN2. We perform genetic suppressor screens that implicate the elongation factor Elongin A (ELOA) in NELF or SPT6 depletion-induced growth arrest. ELOA loss suppresses NELF depletion-induced pre-mRNA processing defects and the 3 extension of RNAPII occupancy past transcription end sites (TES) at genes induced by NELF depletion. ELOA also occupies TES-proximal regions under normal conditions, and acute ELOA depletion results in a loss of RNAPII processivity at the 3 end of genes, opposing the effects of NELF or SPT6 depletion. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic loss of ELOA confers a growth advantage to aging human primary dermal fibroblasts. These findings establish the existence of novel ELOA-dependent mechanisms regulating transcription maturation, and links these mechanisms to the complex phenomena of cellular senescence and aging.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

A variety of instruments have been developed to measure cyanoHAB indicators (i.e., chlorophyll a or phycocyanin) that do not require advanced laboratory processes (e.g., pigment extraction). We compared measurements from five in vivo fluorometers (Turner Trilogy in-vivo module, Turner Fluorosense, Turner Cyanofluor, bbe AlgaeTorch, and bbe Phycoprobe) to results from solvent-based extractions for chlorophyll a and phycocyanin at six different waterbodies in Rhode Island. We found a strong relationship between extracted phycocyanin and in vivo fluorometers (R2 ranging from 0.78-0.96). We found less consistency between in vivo measurements of chlorophyll a and the extracted results (R2 between 0.34 and 0.82). Some variability in the chlorophyll a results can be explained by differences in the phytoplankton community across the different sampling sites. Phycocyanin results from in vivo fluorometry were also strongly related with cell counts, which implies that phycocyanin measurements from these instruments can be a good proxy for cell counts. Many federal, state, and local entities use cell counts of cyanobacteria to determine when to issue health or contact advisories for waterbodies. Producing accurate cell counts requires highly specialized training/equipment, processing time, and counts can vary greatly between technicians.

Curiously, toads on the eastern side of the mountains have a vocal sac and produce a distinct advertisement call whereas toads on the western side of the mountains lack these traits.

We used reduced representation sequencing (ddRAD-seq) to genotype individuals from across the Canadian portion of the species range. Combining population genomic analysis with the original phenotypic data used to delineate the Calling and Non-Calling populations and with predictions from ecological niche models, we show that Calling and Non-Calling populations of western toads represent distinct genetic groups separated by both differences in a major reproductive trait and by climate barriers.

Talidox, a smaller doxorubicin PEGylated liposome is undergoing clinical trials and has been proposed as an improvement on previous liposomal formulations for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. We aimed to validate an easily translatable radiolabeling method using zirconium-89 (89Zr) that enables quantitative whole-body PET imaging of these formulations to study their biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. METHODS: [89Zr][Zr(oxinate)4] was produced using a kit-based approach followed by use as a direct radiolabeling agent of the liposomal formulations. DFT studies were performed to elucidate the mechanism behind the radiolabeling stability observed within the liposomes. Purified 89Zr-labelled Doxil/Talidox liposomes (5 mg/kg doxorubicin dose) were administered in female BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 tumors. PET/CT imaging was acquired at 20 min, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, followed by post-mortem biodistribution at 72 h. RESULTS and DISCUSSION: Both formulations were radiolabeled efficiently with high stability in serum in vitro for 72 h. In vivo, both formulations showed high tumor uptake at 72 h (18.5 +/- 2.4 % IA/g for Doxil and 20.2 +/- 2.3 % IA/g for Talidox). In general, ex vivo biodistribution showed similar uptake values for both formulations with high spleen/liver uptake and low bone uptake, confirming stability. Talidox showed significantly lower spleen uptake and higher uptake in bone than Doxil. DFT studies confirmed that doxorubicin can form complexes with 89Zr that are more stable than [89Zr][Zr(oxinate)4], explaining the radiolabeling mechanism and stability results in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically available PEGylated liposomes containing doxorubicin can be efficiently radiolabelled with 89Zr for PET imaging studies, using a clinically translatable radiolabelling method.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

Within this genus, Bifidobacterium longum (BL.) is a widespread species found in both infant and adult guts, known for its complexity and functional diversity among its known subspecies: BL. longum, BL. infantis and BL. suis. Here, using genomic and phylogenetic tools we propose a novel subspecies within the BL. species, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. nexus subspecies novel. We analyzed 435 BL. genomes using a polyphasic taxonomic approach comprising average nucleotide identity (ANI), digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), and pangenome analysis. We identified nine BL. strains, isolated from human infants and adults stool samples, as members of a distinct lineage within the BL. species. The type strain, LL6991, was isolated from the stool of a two-week-old Dutch infant in the Lifelines NEXT birth cohort. Phenotypically, BL. nexus exhibits a distinct morphological pattern, predominantly forming rod-shaped cells, often in chains with visible septa, contrasting with the Y-shaped morphology commonly observed for other BL. subspecies. Furthermore, BL. nexus demonstrates unique metabolic capabilities, including efficient utilization of fructose, and starch, carbohydrates not metabolized well by other tested BL. subspecies. This ability may be attributed to specific genes, such as a gene predicted to encode an extracellular amylopullulanase. This characterization expands the known diversity within the BL. species and provides insights into BL. nexus's unique adaptations and potential ecological roles within the human gut, especially in infants. Based on the consistent results from genotypic, phylogenetic, and phenotypic analyses, a novel subspecies with the name Bifidobacterium longum subsp. nexus, with type strain LL6991, is proposed.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Brain size measures are well-studied and often treated as a confound in volumetric neuroimaging analyses. Yet their relationship with body anthropometric measures and demographics remains underexplored. In this study, we examined those relationships alongside age- and sex related differences in global brain volumes. Using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of healthy participants in the UK Biobank, we derived global measures of brain morphometry, including total intracranial volume (TIV), total brain volume (TBV), gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We extracted these measures using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) and FreeSurfer. Our analyses were structured in three approaches: across-sex analysis, sexspecific analysis, and impact of age analysis. Employing machine learning (ML), we found that TIV was strongly predicted by sex (across-sex  = 0.68), reflecting sexual dimorphism. On the other hand, TBV, GMV, WMV, and CSF were more sensitive to age, with higher prediction accuracy when age was included as a feature, highlighting age-related changes in the brain structure, such as fluid expansion. Sex-specific models showed reduced TIV prediction ( {approx} 0.25) but improved TBV accuracy ( {approx} 0.44), underscoring sex-specific body-brain relationships. Anthropometrics enhanced prediction but only subsidiary to age and sex. These findings advance our understanding of brain-body scaling relationships and underscore the necessity of accounting for age and sex in neuroimaging studies of brain morphology.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Primary mixed glial cultures are key tools to isolate and study astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes. Cell-substrate adhesion is critical for neural cell survival and differentiation. Cationic polymers like poly-D-lysine (PDL) are widely used to promote cell adhesion to cell culture substrates, however, PDL is not stable long-term, with cultured cells often detaching (peeling) after 2-3 weeks. Dendritic polyglycerol amine (dPGA) is a synthetic polycationic non-protein polymer biomimetic of poly-lysine that is highly resistant to degradation by cellular proteases. Substrates coated with dPGA promote cell adhesion and improve survival in long-term neuronal cultures. Here we assessed dPGA as a substrate coating to provide long-term support for mixed glial cultures. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) were isolated weekly by differential adhesion from cultures grown in T75 flasks with PDL or dPGA-coated substrates. Following two shake-off isolations, the cell layer in most PDL-coated flasks fully detached, rendering these flasks unusable for further culture. In contrast, dPGA-coated flasks consistently yielded cells for six or more sequential isolations over seven weeks in culture. dPGA-coated flasks produced more cells, a greater percentage of O4+ cells, and maintained similar proportions of OPCs and MBP-positive cells as when isolated from a PDL-coated substrate. dPGA is cyto-compatible, functionally superior, easy to use, low cost and a stable alternative to conventional cell substrate coatings. The enhanced long-term stability of mixed glial cultures grown on a dPGA substrate has the capacity to increase cellular yield, reduce animal use, and facilitate studies of oligodendrocyte cell biology.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

E.; Vance, S.; Snider, S. A.; Befano, K.; LeGates, T. A.", "abstract": "Establishing learned associations between rewarding stimuli and the context under which those rewards are encountered is critical for survival. Hippocampal input to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key connection involved in integrating environmental information and reward processing to facilitate goal-directed behaviors. This connection consists of two independent pathways originating from the dorsal (dHipp) or ventral (vHipp) hippocampus, which have previously been considered functionally and anatomically distinct. Here, we show overlap in dHipp and vHipp terminal fields in the NAc, which led us to reconsider this view and raise new questions regarding the potential interactions between dHipp and vHipp pathways in the NAc. Using optogenetics, electrophysiology, and transsynaptic labeling in adult male and female mice, we investigated anatomical and functional convergence of dHipp and vHipp in the NAc. We identified a subpopulation of dually innervated cells in the NAc medial shell where dHipp and vHipp inputs are located near one another along dendritic branches. We independently manipulated dHipp and vHipp inputs via two-color optogenetic manipulation during whole-cell electrophysiology recordings to confirm functional dual innervation of individual neurons and revealed heterosynaptic interactions between the two pathways. Altogether, these results demonstrate that dHipp and vHipp dually innervate a subset of neurons in the NAc, suggesting integration of these inputs at the level of individual neurons. Exploring the physiological and behavioral implications of this convergence will offer new insights into how individual neurons incorporate information from distinct inputs and how this integration may shape learning.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTForming associations between rewards and the circumstances under which they are experienced is vital for survival. Hipp input to the NAc is essential for associating rewards with their environmental context to effectively guide motivated behaviors. This connection consists of two separate pathways originating from dHipp and vHipp that have long been considered distinct. Here, we reveal a subpopulation of neurons in the NAc shell innervated by both Hipp subregions as well as heterosynaptic interactions that occur between dHipp and vHipp synapses. These findings suggest that integration of distinct hippocampal information occurs at the single-neuron level, providing a critical mechanism underlying learning and motivated behavior while also opening new avenues for understanding how diverse contextual and reward signals shape decision-making.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}

D.; McMullan, H. M.; Phan, C.-M. H.; Jagtap, P. P.; Mermelstein, P. G.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that cocaine-induced changes in nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) differ based on dopamine receptor subtype expression, the sex of the animal, and for females, phase of the estrous cycle. These findings highlight the need to account for both sex and estrous cycle when studying drug-mediated alterations in neurophysiology. Whether MSNs of the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), which serve different aspects of addiction, will exhibit similar sex and estrous cycle effects with cocaine administration was investigated. METHODS: Mice underwent a 5-day locomotor sensitization paradigm via daily cocaine administration (15 mg/kg, s.c.) followed by a 1- to 4-day drug-free abstinence period. We examined NAcC MSN excitability by obtaining ex vivo whole-cell recordings from differentially labeled dopamine D1-receptor expressing MSNs (D1R-MSNs) and dopamine D2-receptor expressing MSNs (D2R-MSNs) obtained from male mice or female mice that were either in estrus or diestrus. RESULTS: In this genetic background of mice, both male and female mice sensitized to cocaine in a similar manner. In males, there were no cocaine-induced changes in D1R-MSN or D2R-MSN excitability, with D2R-MSNs exhibiting greater excitability. In saline-treated females, D1R-MSN excitability fluctuated across the estrous cycle with increased excitability during estrus. Following cocaine, estrous cycle-dependent D1R-MSN excitability was arrested, fixed at an intermediate value between estrus and diestrus when compared to saline controls. D2R-MSNs did not change either across the estrous cycle or following cocaine. When comparing MSN subtypes, in diestrus, D2R-MSNs were more excitable under saline conditions, but indistinguishable from D1R-MSNs following cocaine. In contrast, during estrus, D1R- and D2R-MSN excitability was similar in saline treated animals, but with cocaine, D2R-MSNs displayed heightened excitability. CONCLUSIONS: There are fundamental sex differences in cocaine-induced changes to the excitability of D1R-MSNs in the NAcC. After cocaine exposure, female mice in diestrus exhibited a significant main effect change in MSN excitability, an inversion of what had previously been demonstrated in the NAcSh where no cocaine-induced changes were observed. These data suggest that there are distinct differences in the neuropharmacological effect of cocaine in males versus females that are shell and core specific.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Evolution of quantitative traits: exploring the ecological, social and genetic bases of adaptive polymorphism", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.23.661088", "authors": "Lehmann, L.; Mullon, C.", "abstract": "Adaptive polymorphism in quantitative traits, characterised by the coexistence of genetically distinct phenotypes maintained by selection, is a significant contributor to biological diversity. Building on established theoretical results from invasion analysis, we analyse here conditions under which intraspecific adaptive polymorphism emerges and persists through long-term gradual evolution. We highlight that identifying adaptive polymorphisms of a quantitative trait is, in general, a computationally hard problem, but that invasion analyses can straightforwardly provide necessary conditions for both the evolutionary instability of monomorphic populations and the long-term stability of oligomorphic equilibria. We refine two core principles that underpin adaptive polymorphism across biological contexts: (i) the necessity of negative trait-dependent selection, whereby population trait expression reduces directional selection on the trait, for polymorphism to emerge; (ii) the necessity of qualitative dissimilarity among morphs in their fitness responses to the frequency of segregating morphs to ensure long-term coexistence. To clarify these conditions, we present a structured framework that distinguishes production factors (inputs to survival and reproduction that are endogenous to individuals) from regulating factors (genetic, social or ecological inputs to fitness that are influenced in part by conspecifics). We apply this decomposition to elucidate negative trait-dependent selection across both established and new scenarios of adaptive polymorphism across the three broad categories of ecologically, socially, and genetically mediated interactions. By integrating theoretical insights from population genetics, evolutionary ecology, adaptive dynamics, game theory, and inclusive fitness theory, we aim to provide a coherent synthesis of the multiple pathways leading to adaptive polymorphisms in quantitative traits.", "date": "2025-06-23", "journal": ""}
