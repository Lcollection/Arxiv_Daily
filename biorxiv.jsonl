Research consistently showed that adolescents are less cooperative than adults, which is often attributed to underdeveloped mentalizing that limits their expectations of others. However, the internal computations underlying this reduced cooperation remain largely unexplored. This study compared cooperation between adolescents and adults using a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game. Adolescents cooperated less than adults, particularly after their partner's cooperation. Computational modeling revealed that adults increased their intrinsic reward for reciprocating when their partner continued cooperating, a pattern absent in adolescents. Both computational modeling and self-reported ratings showed that adolescents did not differ from adults in building expectations of their partner's cooperation. Therefore, the reduced cooperation appears driven by a lower intrinsic reward for reciprocity, reflecting a stronger motive to prioritize self-interest, rather than a deficiency in mentalizing or social learning. These findings provide insights into the developmental trajectory of cooperation from adolescence to adulthood.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we present additional human data that support this finding and show ALDH2-deficiency in mice provides a fitness advantage during bacterial infections. We found aldehydes normally detoxified by ALDH2 killed the bacterial pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Francisella tularensis. Infected macrophages from Aldh2 deficient mice had higher levels of formaldehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal, which enhanced their microbicidal capacity. Aldh2 deficient mice were more resistant to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Francisella tularensis than parental mice and displayed elevated inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, accompanied by an increased accumulation of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. These findings support a model in which host-derived aldehydes are robust innate immune effectors, limiting bacterial infection through both direct microbicidal activity and immune modulation.

In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feedforward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy and two photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically-distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha RGCs (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (type 5i, type 6 and type 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate that feedforward bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

While fibrils extracted from MSA brains have been structurally characterized, their ability to replicate in a protein-only manner has been questioned, and their capacity to induce GCIs in vivo remains unexplored. By contrast, the synthetic fibril strain 1B, assembled from recombinant human aSyn, self-replicates in vitro and induces GCIs in mice - suggesting direct relevance to MSA - but awaited scrutiny at an atomic scale. Here, we report high-resolution structural analyses of 1B fibrils and of fibrils extracted from diseased mice injected with 1B that developed GCIs (1BP). We show in vivo that conformational templating enables fibril strain replication, resulting in MSA-like inclusion pathology. Remarkably, the structures of 1B and 1BP are highly similar and mimic the fold of aSyn observed in one protofilament of fibrils isolated from MSA patients. Moreover, reinjection of crude mouse brain homogenates containing 1BP into new mice reproduces the same MSA-like pathology induced by the parent synthetic seed 1B.

Using the native microbiome of C. elegans, we show that worms rely on olfaction to select leucine (EAA)-enriched bacteria.

These patterns are predicted to worsen with climate change, further exacerbating the vulnerability of the regions'' primate species, 94% of which are threatened with extinction. Here, we report findings from a systematic search of the literature and synthesise the current state of knowledge regarding the impacts of El Nino-driven drought, fire, and smoke on non-human primates in Southeast Asia. Our review shows that habitat loss and degradation driven by El Nino-induced drought and fire causes changes to diet, activity patterns, social interactions, and physical condition, and leads to population crowding, reduced group sizes, increased infant mortality, displacement of individuals, and even local extirpation. Further, prolonged exposure to smoke alters behaviour and worsens the health of primates. Notably, two studies presented evidence for the recovery of primate populations in habitats damaged by fire if forest is allowed to regenerate. We highlight significant gaps in our understanding of the impacts of El Nino on non-human primates, particularly the need for research that encompasses the interconnected factors of rainfall, temperature, fire, and smoke, as well as long-term effects on reproduction and mortality.

Most prior work has treated BMP-component mutations as mechanistically interchangeable, yet whether distinct genes converge on a shared mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to understand the molecular relationship between BMP signaling and endothelial flow response that leads to AVM formation. Methods: We expose human endothelial monolayers treated with siRNA against SMAD4 or ALK1 to laminar flow and analyze flow-responsive transcriptomics, flow-responsive BMP signaling activation dynamics, cell polarity and morphology. We analyze the cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous migration dynamics of ECs treated with siSMAD4 or siALK1. Using the postnatal mouse retina model, we study EC distribution changes over time in mosaic settings, and assess the remodelling capabilities of Smad4iECKO or Alk1iECKO, relative to littermate controls. Results: This study shows that mutations in SMAD4 or ALK1 lead to fundamentally distinct mechanisms of malformation formation. SMAD4 deficiency enhances endothelial responses to blood flow, including transcriptional activation and migration against flow, causing excessive capillary pruning and the development of single large shunts. In contrast, ALK1 deficiency disrupts flow sensing, impairs cell polarization and migration, and promotes a persistent angiogenic state, resulting in dense, hypervascularized networks. RNA sequencing reveals that these transcriptional changes precede flow onset, suggesting early defects in endothelial fate specification. Mosaic in vitro models show that mutant cells co-opt neighboring wild-type cells, while in vivo tracking confirms mutation-specific migration behavior. Conclusions: These findings reveal divergent cellular programs driving arteriovenous malformations and underscore the need for gene-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

However, the accuracy and optimal strategy for analysis of Nanopore reads remains to be determined. We compared the use of Illumina short reads and Oxford Nanopore long reads for genome assembly and variant calling of phytopathogenic bacteria. We generated short- and long-read datasets for diverse phytopathogenic Agrobacterium strains. We then analyzed these data using multiple pipelines designed for either short or long reads and compared the results. We found that assemblies made from long reads were more complete than those made from short-read data and contained few sequence errors. Variant calling pipelines differed in their ability to accurately call variants and infer genotypes from long reads. Results suggest that computationally fragmenting long reads can improve the accuracy of variant calling in population-level studies. Using fragmented long reads, pipelines designed for short reads were more accurate at recovering genotypes than pipelines designed for long reads.

Reassortment, a form of recombination specific to segmented genomes, involves the exchange of entire segments and has contributed significantly to the adaptation and spread of influenza viruses through novel genomic combinations, i.e., antigenic shifts. It is usually identified by phylogenetic discordance: differences in the topologies of trees reconstructed from different genomic segments. However, phylogenetic discordance can also result from error in reconstructing trees. To characterize the impact of reconstruction error, we curated a database of n=11,765 complete genomes of avian H5Nx influenza A viruses from avian hosts. We found evidence of widespread reassortment as measured by inferred subtree-prune-regraft (SPR) events, consistent with previous studies. Next, we ran replicate simulations of sequence evolution along the reference tree for the segment encoding hemagglutinin (HA), adjusting simulations for the lengths and clock rates of the other segments. These simulations provided a baseline for the expected amount of phylogenetic discordance in the absence of any reassortment. When sampling HA sequences at random from the database to build reference trees, we observed that simulating other segments without reassortment still yielded about 32% as many SPRs as the real segment data on average. The average proportion of SPRs without reassortment was greatly reduced (4%) if we selected an equivalent number of HA sequences retaining the most genetic diversity, which was consistent with the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction being the limiting factor. This implies that measuring reassortment by SPRs may have a high false positive rate, and that previous evidence of extensive reassortment in influenza viruses should be interpreted with caution. In addition, we observed that the SPRs reconstructed on simulated trees had significantly shorter distances between the prune and regraft locations than real trees. These results suggest that down sampling sequences to maximize evolutionary divergence and filtering out the shortest SPRs may be effective measures against false positives.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

The use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data offers the possibility for enhanced eQTL mapping accuracy, but the detection of causal variants remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the potential added-value of integrating tissue-specific epigenetic annotations, such as chromatin accessibility and methylation status, into within-breed genomic predictions of gene expression for three distinct pig breeds: Duroc, Landrace, and Large White. By incorporating functional annotations from early developmental stages, we demonstrated improved eQTL mapping interpretability and highlighted the enrichment of trait-relevant QTLs.

Glioblastoma (GB) is the most malignant genetically diverse brain tumour, with no cure. The most common genetic mutation in GB is a truncated active mutant of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the EGFRvIII. OSMR orchestrates a feedforward signaling mechanism with EGFRvIII and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to drive GB progression. Beyond EGFRvIII, OSMR promotes brain tumour stem cells (BTSCs) via upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and contributes to therapy resistance. The molecular mechanisms underlying the multifaceted roles of OSMR in different contexts are largely unclear. Here, we systematically mapped the OSMR interactome using Mammalian Membrane Two-Hybrid High-Throughput Screening (MaMTH-HTS). This unbiased approach led to the identification of OSMR-specific and OSMR/EGFRvIII-specific binding proteins, revealing context-dependent OSMR functions. Among a subset of common interactors, we uncovered chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) as a critical regulator of both OSMR-STAT3 signaling and the OSMR/EGFRvIII complex in GB. CLIC1 physically associates with both OSMR and EGFRvIII and plays a key role in EGFRvIII packaging into extracellular vesicles (EVs). Genetic deletion of CLIC1 disrupts the OSMR/EGFRvIII interaction, impairs STAT3 activation, reduces EGFRvIII EV content, and slows GB progression. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets transmembrane CLIC1 (tmCLIC1omab), we establish a distinct pharmacologically and biophysically tmCLIC-mediated current in GB indispensable for sustaining EGFRvIII/STAT3 signaling. Importantly, we show that OSMR is required for maintaining CLIC1-mediated ionic balance at the plasma membrane (PM). Our study uncovers a bidirectional crosstalk between OSMR and tmCLIC1 in GB, essential for fueling its malignant growth, and suggests that disrupting the OSMR/tmCLIC1 interaction provides a promising therapeutic avenue for GB treatment.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

M.; Kufel, J.; Atkins, J.; Baranov, P.", "abstract": "Ribosomal frameshifting is an important, albeit rare, mRNA decoding mechanism that generally allows the synthesis of a single protein from two different reading frames. For most +1 frameshifting cases, the mechanism is commonly presumed to involve dissociation of the P-site tRNA from its cognate codon followed by its movement to the +1 codon, setting the new +1 frame for incoming tRNAs. This movement is stabilized by P-site tRNA pairing with the +1 codon. However, in several occurrences in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, P-site tRNA re-pairing with the +1 codon is impossible. Two alternative hypotheses exist explaining this observation. One model suggests that +1 frameshifting occurs according to a common mechanism involving P-site movement, while its re-pairing with +1 codon is not essential. The alternative model suggests a distinct mechanism in which the A-site tRNA acceptance at the +1 codon occurs in the absence of P-site tRNA movement relative to mRNA. Here we set out to perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of all known +1 ribosomal frameshifting sites in S. cerevisiae. This included a novel case of +1 ribosomal frameshifting that we discovered during this study. It is required for the expression of LLP1 gene encoding dolichol-linked oligosaccharide pyrophosphatase. During the analysis of all frameshifting contexts, we identified a conserved RNA secondary structure located almost immediately upstream of the ABP140 frameshifting site. This structure substantially increases +1 frameshifting efficiency. The RNA stimulator's location suggests that mRNA exiting the ribosome forms this structure, creating an mRNA pulling effect, thus favouring positioning of the +1 codon in the P-site. Placing the stimulator upstream of various known frameshifting sites, revealed that its stimulatory action is selective to those frameshifting sites where P-site tRNA re-pairing is possible, reinforcing the idea of two distinct mechanisms of ribosomal frameshifting.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Using alpha-actinin, an actin crosslinking protein, as a challenging test system, we show that AFMfit guided by nonlinear normal mode analysis (AFMfit-NMA) enables accurate structural fitting, while guiding AFMfit with MD trajectories (AFMfit-MD) further enhances the flexible fitting performance, achieving closer agreement with unbiased all-atom MD simulation results. This strategy allows us to convert thousands of three-dimensional HS-AFM images into atomic-scale conformational ensembles, revealing the twisting and bending transitions underlying Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-unbound alpha-actinin.

Here, we present CRISPR-Taiji (CRISPRt), an efficient method for inducing chromosome-specific mis-segregation and aneuploidy generation across all 24 human chromosomes via dead Cas9 (dCas9)-induced centromeric chromatin relaxation. Using CRISPRt with scRNA-seq, we generated the first comprehensive transcriptomic alteration landscape of nearly all autosomal aneuploidies at chromosome-arm resolution. This genotype-phenotype map provides causal evidence linking recurrent aneuploidies in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) to molecular and clinical phenotypes observed in patient tumors. Notably, chromosome 3(p) loss, the ccRCC initiating event, specifically drives strong interferon signaling activation, offering novel insights into ccRCC tumorigenesis and immune modulation. Overall, we establish CRISPRt as a simple, efficient and scalable approach for chromosome-specific aneuploidy engineering and characterization in preclinical models to advance aneuploidy research across diverse biological contexts.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

We present a methodological platform that enables segment-resolved profiling of mitochondrial respiration, conductance, and membrane potential in freshly isolated mouse and human nephron segments. Combining mechanical sieving and adhesion-based enrichment with permeabilized high-resolution respirometry, we adapted the creatine kinase clamp to quantify oxygen flux and mitochondrial membrane potential across defined free energies. Using this approach, we found that proximal tubules exhibit high respiratory conductance and dynamic mitochondrial polarization, while distal tubules and glomeruli maintain static membrane potential and low conductance. In a model of adenine-induced nephropathy, only proximal tubule mitochondria showed marked reductions in respiration and ATP production. This segment-specific dysfunction was not detectable in bulk mitochondrial isolates. We then demonstrate that these methods can be applied in human kidney samples. Our approach provides thermodynamically anchored, segment-resolved insight into mitochondrial adaptation under physiological and pathological conditions. It is broadly applicable to other tissues with metabolic heterogeneity and compatible with disease models, genetic tools, and pharmacological interventions. This platform bridges a critical gap between conventional respirometry and functional mitochondrial phenotyping in native tissue structures.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

However, the precise neurophysiological mechanisms relating abnormal sleep to aberrant daytime network activity that accelerates disease progression has yet to be determined. We collected chronic, multi-night (n=40), intracranial cortico-basal recordings during sleep from a cohort of patients with PD along with paired polysomnography and morning self-reports. This revealed that longer duration (and shorter latency) of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep predicted reduced daytime resting beta (13-30 Hz) activity and cortico-basal functional and effective connectivity, features established to be pathophysiological in PD. Within REM sleep, stronger cortical delta activity specifically predicted reduced pathophysiological cortico-basal neural network features. Additionally, REM delta power significantly predicted greater self-reported morning alertness. These findings highlight a potentially protective role of REM sleep in cortico-basal network health in PD and daytime subjective experience, representing a potential target for closed loop neuromodulation therapies to impact neurodegenerative disease progression.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Therapeutic proteins have seen a substantial increase in clinical development and use across many disease areas. Despite their broad applicability, significant drawbacks limit access to many of these drugs, including: i) high manufacturing costs; ii) administration via time-consuming infusions; iii) frequent dosing, sometimes even daily; and iv) requirements for low temperature storage.\n\nMYO Technology was developed to overcome these barriers. The MYO Technology platform consists of therapeutic-encoding plasmid DNA (pDNA), and a proprietary medical device for intramuscular injection and delivery of electrical pulses. These pulses enable the in vivo electroporation of muscle cells and uptake of injected pDNA, leading to the production, secretion, and delivery of the therapeutic protein into peripheral circulation. MYO Technology offers several advantages over standard delivery of therapeutic proteins; pDNA manufacturing is a simpler and less specialized process compared to protein manufacturing, and pDNA is very stable and lacks most cold chain requirements. Furthermore, administration using MYO Technology takes only a few minutes, and the serum level of a therapeutic protein can potentially be maintained for many months without the need for redosing.\n\nIncretin receptor agonists (IRAs) are a class of therapeutic proteins that have recently come to prominence as powerful weight and glucose control drugs, and are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Semaglutide and tirzepatide, currently the most widely used within this class, are both potent molecules, but have a short half-life, requiring weekly administration by subcutaneous injections. Moreover, since their clinical benefits rapidly disappear upon treatment cessation, T2D and obese patients may have a life-long dependency on IRAs, and the requirement for weekly injections can negatively affect the quality of life and the adherence to therapy, as well as create a significant financial burden. Therefore, increasing the interval between injections has become one of the major goals in the field.\n\nHere, we present our preclinical studies on the delivery of IRAs with MYO Technology. Animal proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that MYO Technology-delivered IRAs are functional, and efficacious in promoting long-lasting weight and glucose control in mouse models of diet-induced obesity. Moreover, engineering the IRAs to facilitate blood-brain barrier penetration further enhances treatment efficacy, with benefits persisting well beyond six months following a single administration. Together, these findings highlight MYO Technologys potential to transform care for patients with T2D and obesity by enabling long-lasting therapeutic effects with minimal dosing, ultimately improving quality of life and treatment adherence.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Yet, choosing the best method for a study is challenging, because both the reliability for identification and the severity of adverse effects of a given mark type can greatly vary between species as well as life stages. We compared the reliability of three identification methods in young agile frogs (Rana dalmatina): clipping a single phalanx, injecting visible-implant-elastomer (VIE) tags (one of six colours) under the skin, and photo-based identification using natural colouration. Individuals were regularly photographed from the start of metamorphosis onwards, and were marked by the other two methods soon after all of them finished metamorphosis. Subsequently, we checked mark retention by each method multiple times for more than a year. Photo-based identification was far more reliable than the other two methods: 100% identification success post-metamorphosis in all checking events within small housing groups, and 98% with computer-assisted identification across all housing groups. Post-metamorphic body colouration remained largely stable, and the major patterns were already present at metamorphosis. Based on VIE colour alone, we could correctly identify the animals in 77% of the checks. Green tags were the easiest to recognize. VIE often broke into smaller parts, and those were sometimes found only outside the originally tagged body part (15%) or not found at all (10%). VIE was better retained in the legs than in the arms. Dissection revealed that migrating VIE pieces can accumulate in the internal organs, especially the kidneys. The clipped toe was successfully recognized only in 41% of checks. We conclude that photo-based identification is superior to both VIE-tagging and toe tipping in young agile frogs, and this method should be preferred in future studies seeking a cost-efficient yet reliable identification method in this species.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

This study evaluated the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in extracting these associations through a binary classification task using a curated dataset of 1,000 manually labeled PubMed abstracts. We benchmarked a wide range of open-source LLMs of varying sizes (4B-70B parameters), including generalist, reasoning, and biomedical-specific models. We also investigated the extent to which prompting strategies such as zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain of Thought (CoT) methods can improve classification performance. Our results indicate that model performance varied by size, architecture, and prompting strategy. Zero-shot prompting produced the most reliable results, with Mistral-Small-Instruct-2409 and Nemotron-70B achieving strong balanced accuracy scores of 0.81 and macro F1 scores of up to 0.80, while maintaining minimal invalid outputs.

Gemcitabine (GEM) benefits only a subset of patients. Methylglyoxal (MG), a glycolysis byproduct, has been linked to tumor behavior and therapy response in PDAC, suggesting potential as a stratification marker. METHODS: We developed a metabolically informed gene signature (MG-GEM) integrating MG-related glycolytic stress with clinical outcomes. Using the Puleo cohort (n=309), differential expression analysis between tumors with high and low MG stress identified 365 genes. LASSO Cox regression selected 16 prognostic genes, combined into a weighted risk score for patient stratification. MG GEM was validated in internal and external cohorts, including PRODIGE 24/CCTG PA6. Molecular, transcriptomic, and immune features were compared between high and low MG GEM groups. Finally, predictive performance was evaluated against the GemPred signature. RESULTS: MG GEM divided PDAC patients into distinct risk groups with marked differences in overall and disease-free survival among GEM treated patients (OS 11.7 vs 27.2 months; DFS 7.6 vs 17.8 months, both p<0.0001). High MG-GEM tumors showed enrichment for KRAS G12D and SMAD4 mutations, basal and activated stroma subtypes, glycolytic metabolism, and reduced immune infiltration. Low MG-GEM tumors showed KRAS G12V, classical and immune subtypes, cholesterogenic metabolism, and adaptive immune favourable signatures. MG-GEM independently predicted GEM-specific clinical outcomes, irrespective of GemPred signature, and significantly enhanced patient stratification when combined with it. Within the PRODIGE-24/TGCC PA6 cohort, MG-GEM exhibited prognostic relevance and selectively identified patients who derived a survival benefit from adjuvant GEM, but not from FOLFIRINOX. CONCLUSIONS: The 16 gene MG GEM signature predicts prognosis in resected PDAC, reflects glycolytic stress driven chemoresistance, surpassing conventional molecular classifications. As a metabolically informed signature, MG-GEM holds promise for guiding chemotherapy selection and informing KRAS-targeted combination strategies, meriting further prospective clinical validation.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

In this study, we conducted extensive field monitoring of two rice paddy fields in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, where a rice variety, Hinohikari, was cultivated to investigate how ecological communities influence rice growth and yields under two contrasting farming practices: conventional farming and no-fertilizer farming. We had three objectives: (1) to monitor rice growth and ecological dynamics to create a comprehensive ecological time series using quantitative environmental DNA metabarcoding and complementary monitoring methods, (2) to identify ecological variables that causally affect rice performance using nonlinear time series analysis, and (3) to examine the effects of the two farming practices on ecological variables and rice performance. As expected, the no-fertilizer paddy field showed lower rice growth and yields but still produced 40-50% of the yields of the conventional field. Ecological monitoring revealed contrasting ecological communities between the two fields, particularly among plant species on the paddy ridges and microbial taxa. Twenty-five taxa had statistically clear causal influences on rice performance. While the per-abundance influences of the causal taxa were largely similar in both paddy fields, their abundances were different, contributing to the differences in the overall effects of these taxa on the rice performance. These findings suggest that the abundance of causal taxa, along with nutrient conditions, may have driven differences in rice growth between the two paddy fields.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

In this report we used an efficient enzymatic oxidative coupling reaction to create a viral capsid-based vaccine platform that is modular and quickly adaptable for many different pathogens. Tyrosinase-mediated oxidative coupling was used to conjugate C-terminal tyrosine residues on peptide antigens to cysteine residues installed inside MS2 viral capsids. This strategy is particularly promising because the capsids protect the internally conjugated peptides from protease degradation before they are delivered into cells. The vaccine constructs were tested for MHC presentation followed by T-cell activation. Mutants of the MS2 capsid itself activated DC2.4 cells, serving as an adjuvant to help induce the immune response to delivered antigens. The MS2-peptide constructs were shown to be stable in serum, activate DC2.4 cells, and lead to MHC-presentation of peptide antigens with subsequent activation of antigen-specific T-cell hybridomas. Taken together, these results demonstrate effective activation of the adaptive immune system in vitro. This synthetic platform can be used to build new vaccines for many different diseases for which immunodominant peptide antigens are known because the antigens can be quickly interchanged while the MS2 scaffold remains the same. Additionally, this platform allows for multiple peptide antigens to be delivered simultaneously in each capsid, which could provide enhanced immunity against resistant strains and be useful for cancer vaccine development.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

However, conventional protocols include multiple manual steps that can introduce inconsistency and limit scalability, thereby restricting the inclusion of appropriate replicates and controls. Although the introduction of liquid handling platforms has improved reproducibility, most existing efforts have automated only a subset of the workflow, and extending automation to efficiently map non-histone proteins, such as chromatin regulators, remains challenging. Here, we present a fully automated implementation of our previously developed single-pot ChIP-seq protocol (Texari et al. 2021), named spa-ChIP-seq, which enables scalable processing of 8 to 96 ChIP-seq samples from crosslinked cells to sequencing-ready library in approximately three days with an estimated cost of $70 per sample. Benchmarking spa-ChIP-seq against manual ChIP-seq performed in parallel demonstrates comparable signal-to-noise ratio between the two workflows. Using spa-ChIP-seq, we systematically evaluate multiple parameters including shearing and crosslinking conditions, buffer compositions, and the ratio of antibody to cell-number. We find, for the first time to our knowledge, that weaker genomic localization signals are sensitive to changing the antibody to cell-number ratio, whereas the stronger signals remain unaffected. This finding underscores the importance of maintaining consistent antibody-to-cell-number ratio for comparative studies, such as treatment responses or chromatin-QTL mapping. The spa-ChIP-seq protocol is publicly available, including deck setups, operational parameters, and scripts.

Transitive inference (TI) tasks test the ability of subjects to infer relationships within a value hierarchy (e.g., A>B>C>D>E) after being trained only on adjacent premise pairs (e.g., A-B, B-C, etc.). In rodents, current TI paradigms are primarily based on odor-cues and have several limitations that preclude investigation of physiological mechanisms underlying schemas and deliberation. To address these challenges, we developed a novel, automated spatial TI task for rats using a radial maze with maze arms as premise elements and a dedicated deliberation zone. Most rats successfully learned the premise pairs over training. Further, animals demonstrated rapid, successful inference (test pair B>D and control pair A>E) within a single test session, with higher initial accuracy than comparable premise pairs, indicating the use of schema-based inference. We also investigated vicarious trial and error's (VTE), a behavioral correlate of spatial deliberation. VTE behavior was elevated on choice trajectories early in learning, when novel premise pairs were introduced, and generally for incorrect trials, corresponding to the hypothesized association of VTE's with uncertainty. Further, rats also exhibited elevated VTE behavior with high variability during inference testing, with individual variability suggestive of varying strengths of schema usage.

When musical sounds are compared to animal vocalizations, human speech, and non-biological sounds including noise, we statistically confirm that music maintains the highest stability in the space of CES. This fitness signal related to attention varies across musical genres and is also detected animal calls as well. Attention signaling also differs significantly between experts versus novice musicians, adult versus immature bird songs, and is constrained by musical performance interactions with live audiences as well. We conclude that audiovisual signaling via this calculus of attention to behavioral display reflects the physics of observing bodies in motion, probably originating from selective pressure of intra/interspecific conflicts formed at the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, and retained in modern music today.\n\nLay SummaryMost animals (including humans) pay attention to specific audiovisual stimuli within their environment. Here we explore common features of these stimuli and propose a single mathematical framework (with software) for detecting and measuring attention signaling in the context of sound. We show that musical sounds are exceptionally attractive of our attention and that attention signaling in music probably has ancient evolutionary roots that connect to when early life forms started to evolve swift directed movement and the sensory capacities to detect it.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Hence, this study screened n-hexane fractions of Zingiber officinale and Moringa oleifera oils as protectant against Callosobruchus chinensis and revealed their chemical profiles using Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). M. oleifera (LC50; 0.007{micro}l) was found to be more toxic than Z. officinale oil (LC50; 0.055{micro}l) to C. chinensis.

While non-muscle myosin II (NM II) is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, whether it regulates IEC colonization by A/E pathogens is not known. To address this question, we targeted NM IIA and NM IIC, the NM II paralogs expressed in IECs. Our in vivo studies utilized mouse models with either intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of NM IIA (NM IIA cKO mice), expression of a NM IIA motor domain mutant, or total deletion of NM IIC (NM IIC tKO mice). In vitro experiments utilized IECs (HT-29cF8 and Caco-2BBE) with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of NM IIA or NM IIC. In addition, NM II activity in vitro was modulated pharmacologically, using either the pan-myosin inhibitor, blebbistatin, or a specific NM IIC activator, 4-hydroxyacetophenone (4-HAP). NM IIA cKO and NM IIA mutant mice demonstrated higher C. rodentium colonization along with more severe mucosal inflammation and colonic crypt hyperplasia as compared to their controls. By contrast, NM IIC tKO mice was indistinguishable from their control with regard to C. rodentium colonization. Blebbistatin treatment increased EPEC attachment to IECs monolayers, whereas 4-HAP did not affect bacterial attachment. Genetic knockout of NM IIA, but not NM IIC, increased EPEC adhesion to IEC monolayers. Importantly, the increase in EPEC attachment exhibited by NM IIA-deficient IECs required intact bacterial Type 3 secretion system and functional Tir effector, indicating that NM IIA functions in actin pedestal assembly.

Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers a convenient, noninvasive way to track this species, yet open-set rainforest soundscapes make single-species detection challenging. We present a machine-learning pipeline with a very low false-positive rate, appropriate for downstream inference. The method combines a band-pass filter (5-10 kHz), Perch bioacoustic embeddings (deep learning), and a One-Class SVM (OCSVM) applied to sliding windows of continuous audio recordings to detect S. bicolor calls. We train on a reduced dataset of labeled calls and validate against diverse out-of-class audio (birds, anurans, anthropophony, and geophony/insects), then test on long, cross-site recordings. The approach achieves high discrimination on held-out negatives and produces very low false-positive rates in realistic, continuous audio. Finally, we pair detections with a single-site occupancy model in a cross-site setting to illustrate end-to-end utility for conservation monitoring and to estimate the false-negative detection probability in recordings from pied tamarin populations in a different geographic region. Our strategy provides a tool for PAM of S. bicolor that requires minimal manual labeling effort and can be adapted to other open-set, single-species monitoring scenarios.

Here, we fill a void on knowledge on finger millet-infecting strains of M. oryzae by sequencing 226 isolates pure-cultured from infected tissues, mainly peduncles and panicles, sampled from field-grown finger millet accessions across Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Phylogenetic analysis showed that eastern African isolates are genetically distinct from Asian isolates, and differentiated into two groups potentially driven by climate variables. One group was dominated by isolates from Kenya and Uganda (KU group), and the other by isolates from Ethiopia and Tanzania (ET group). Analysis of the portfolio of 887 predicted effector genes showed that the KU group had significantly fewer effectors, concomitant with higher virulence levels on the two finger millet accessions tested.\n\nWe demonstrate that homologous recombination between transposable elements, leading to genomic deletions, plays a key role in gene removal. Transcript profiling of fungal genes in compatible and incompatible interactions revealed upregulation in the incompatible interaction as a characteristic of an estimated 30% of effector genes, including seven of the eight homologs of known avirulence genes from rice-infecting M. oryzae identified in our study.

While its pulmonary effects are well established, the mechanisms linking lung inflammation to vascular injury remain unclear. Because neutrophils are early responders to CS-induced inflammation, we hypothesized that they drive systemic myelopoiesis and vascular inflammation via alarmin release.\n\nMethodsWild-type (WT) mice were exposed to inhaled CS or orally administered cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Immune cell composition in lung, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), blood, spleen, and bone marrow (BM) was assessed by flow cytometry. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and S100A8/A9 release were quantified.

To define the role of neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9, bone marrow transplantation was performed using S100a9-/- or WT donors.\n\nResultsCS exposure increased circulating monocytes and neutrophils through enhanced BM myelopoiesis and elevated ROS-dependent S100A8/A9 release. Oral CSE reproduced these effects, indicating direct activation of neutrophils independent of pulmonary inflammation or lipid changes.

CMT2A is mainly caused by dominant mutations in the MFN2 gene, encoding Mitofusin-2, a GTPase located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations in MFN2 are known to affect mitochondrial dynamics. We previously demonstrated that the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln further disrupts contacts between the ER and the mitochondria, leading to progressive axonal degeneration. There is no effective therapeutic approach to slow or reverse the progression of CMT2A, and treatments currently under development primarily focus on restoring mitochondrial function. Here, we provide proof-of-concept that neuronal overexpression of wild-type MFN2 (MFN2WT) provides therapeutic benefit in transgenic CMT2A mice carrying the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln. Intrathecal delivery of an AAV9 vector expressing MFN2WT effectively targets motor and sensory neurons, restoring ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial morphology, thereby preserving both neuromuscular junction integrity and motor function. Strikingly, therapeutic efficacy is also achieved following vector injection after the onset of symptoms, rescuing the molecular hallmarks of CMT2A pathology and reversing locomotor. Notably, AAV administration was well tolerated, with no evidence neither of hepatotoxicity nor dorsal root ganglion inflammation.

Here we asked whether this parabrachial-EA pathway participates in compensation during acute hypotension. In rats given hydralazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), we quantified Fos protein during an early phase (60 min) and a late phase (120 min). Early after hypotension, Fos surged in a discrete subpopulation of the parabrachial Kolliker-Fuse (KF) region and in the EA, whereas magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (SON/PVN) remained largely silent. By 120 min, magnocellular SON/PVN neurons were robustly Fos-positive. Confocal immunohistochemistry showed that most Fos+ PKC{delta}/GluD1 EA neurons were encircled by PACAP+ perisomatic terminals (80.8%), of which the majority co-expressed VGluT1 (88.1%). RNAscope in situ hybridization further identified a selective KF population co-expressing Adcyap1 (PACAP) and Slc17a7 (VGluT1) that became Fos-positive during the early phase. Together these data indicate that a KFPACAP/VGluT1 projection forms calyceal terminals around PKC{delta}/GluD1 EA neurons, providing a high-fidelity route for rapid autonomic rebound to falling blood pressure, while slower endocrine support is subsequently recruited via vasopressinergic magnocellular activation.

However, whether skeletal muscle retains a memory of disuse remains unknown. We investigated repeated lower-limb immobilization in young adults and a refined aged rat model of repeated disuse, integrating multi-omics, histology, biochemistry, and primary human cell analyses. In young human muscle, a second period of disuse elicited an attenuated transcriptional response in oxidative and mitochondrial pathways, suggesting a protective molecular memory, although this did not translate into attenuated atrophy. In contrast, aged muscle exhibited a detrimental molecular memory, with greater atrophy, exaggerated suppression of aerobic metabolism genes/pathways despite recovery of these genes after initial disuse, depletion of NAD+ and mitochondrial DNA, and activation of proteasomal, extracellular matrix and DNA-damage pathways. Repeated disuse induced DNA hypermethylation and downregulation of aerobic metabolism and mitochondrial genes across species. NR4A1 remained suppressed in young human muscle, whereas acetylcholine receptor subunit genes were epigenetically primed in humans and further upregulated with repeated atrophy in both young and aged muscle. NMRK2 was among the most downregulated genes after both periods of atrophy in humans, and nicotinamide riboside improved myotube size in primary human muscle cells derived post-atrophy.

A.", "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) are dynamic cytoskeletal filaments composed of - and {beta}-tubulin protein dimers. They are crucial for maintaining cell structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and ensuring proper chromosome segregation among other things. These biological functions are influenced by the dynamic instability of the MT plus-end tip. Recent work has challenged traditional models in which GTP (guanosine-5'-triphosphate) hydrolysis directly regulates microtubule lattice stability. To explore these notions further, in this work, we have constructed, from bottom up, a relatively high resolution coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) model for tubulins with 20 CG sites per tubulin monomer and then performed extensive CG MD simulations on MT lattices with 8 and 40 layers of heterodimers. Our findings demonstrate that, independent of nucleotide state, MT plus-end tips can form distinct, similarly curved protofilament (PF) clusters. These clusters are stable up to tens of microseconds of CG MD simulation time during spontaneous outward bending relaxation, and their formation is driven by an intrinsic thermodynamic instability of the MT lattice. Such lattice instability accumulates in longer microtubules and further facilitates protofilament cluster formation with outward bending relaxation; however, in longer MTs the lattice instability can also be released via lattice curvature and in-lattice twisting. Our systematic parametrization of the CG forcefield from atomic scale interactions also confirms weakened lateral interactions in GDP-MTs, which lead to faster bending relaxation and the formation of more PF clusters in both 8-layer and 40-layer GDP-bound MT lattices. A comprehensive all-atom MD analysis reveals that the formation of PF clusters is initiated by relaxation in the longitudinal interactions and later stabilized by relaxation in the lateral interactions. Our findings highlight the critical role of lattice instability in microtubule dynamics and offer new insight on the behavior of MT plus-end tips.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

How this balancing is computed is not well understood. We have approached this problem at the level of neural population-coding by examining the effect of progressive starvation on a hypothalamic line attractor that encodes an internal state of aggressiveness. Moderate fasting yielded 'hangry' mice, decreasing attack latency and increasing attack frequency. In parallel, line attractor ramping rate and stability were increased, suggesting that hunger enhances aggressiveness by modifying neural dynamics. In contrast, prolonged starvation inhibited aggression and eliminated the line attractor. In satiated mice, titrated acute chemogenetic activation of arcuate AgRP neurons recapitulated the biphasic effects of progressive starvation, suggesting that a continuous increase in hunger exerts bi-directional influences at different intensities. When confronted with food and an intruder, hangry mice alternated between feeding and fighting. During eating, population neural activity moved out of the line attractor while activity in the attractor dimension remained unchanged. Following feeding, activity rapidly relaxed back into the attractor and aggression resumed. Thus, the line attractor may serve to keep hungry animals primed for aggression during intermittent feeding bouts.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

By integrating model-free behavioural patterns and psychological intentions, we show that individuals are driven by increased flexibility and are more susceptible to peer influence in decision-making under cooperation. While under coordination, it is easier to reach the group consensus, inspiring individuals to stick more closely to their existing behavioural patterns and the `default' social norms. Furthermore, although peer punishment can enhance reciprocal contributions in all scenarios, the detailed impact and the resultant adverse phenomena (anti-social punishment) in cooperation and coordination are different. Notably, behavioural motive differences are also reflected in the neural responses recorded via fNIRS, in which coordination is associated with activation of the rTPJ and more consistent inter-brain synchronization in the dmPFC, while there is a negative correlation between dmPFC-rTPJ connectivity and contributions under cooperation. In addition, rTPJ during the punishment phase is significantly activated compared with the investment phase. Our study systematically reveals the fundamental differences between cooperation and coordination at the multi-scale levels, which not only deepens the understanding of reciprocal behaviour in social groups, but also provides a foundation for designing targeted incentive mechanisms.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Using model-based fMRI and a novel multi-incentive control task, we observed distinct neural patterns by incentive valence, with ventral striatum and caudal subregion of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex showing greater sensitivity to rewards whereas inferior frontal gyrus and rostral subregion of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex showing greater sensitivity to penalties. Reward-sensitive regions were associated with increased efficiency (e.g., faster responding with moderate decreases in accuracy) whereas penalty-sensitive regions were associated with increased caution (e.g., slower responding with increased accuracy). We disentangled the global and selective influences of motivation on control processes and subjective experience, providing novel insight into the neurocomputational mechanisms of how effort is determined by expected reward and punishment.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Proteomic profiling of fibrotic biopsies revealed consistent upregulation of collagen VI and laminin {gamma}1, alongside disease-specific alterations involving other ECM proteins. Fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are the predominant source of these ECM components, including collagen VI and laminin {gamma}1. Functionally, xenotransplantation of patient-derived FAPs into regenerating mouse muscle induced localized collagen deposition, myofiber atrophy, and depletion of Pax7+ muscle stem cells. Mechanistic assays demonstrated that FAP-derived collagen VI is sufficient to impair myogenic fusion, while silencing COL6 in patient FAPs restores fusion capacity, directly linking pathological collagen VI deposition to regeneration failure.

Current approaches predominantly rely on Ensembl homology tables, whose default many-to-many mappings often amplify gene-family effects and introduce artifactual micro-clusters that lack clear cell-type identity, thereby complicating biological interpretation. While restricting mappings to a one-to-one scheme suppresses such artifacts, it reduces the number of homology gene pairs by approximately 8% ([~]900 pairs). To address this limitation, we developed a protein large language model (pLLM)-based gene homology mapping strategy that boosts the number of homology gene pairs. By integrating pLLM-derived representations with sequence similarity, we constructed a fused mapping approach, which achieved top performance in a comprehensive benchmark based on a curated cross-species atlas -- spanning nine datasets, 11 species, and over 3.2 million cells. Our method further identifies previously unannotated cell-type marker pairs, facilitating novel cross-species marker discovery. These results establish a robust framework for gene homology mapping in cross-species transcriptome integration, improving both accuracy and biological interpretability.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

While tumor cell plasticity has been extensively studied, the molecular plasticity of T cells in vivo remains poorly defined. Objectives: To characterize transcriptional changes in T cells during TNBC progression and identify stage-specific shifts in T cell function, polarization, and antigen-presenting cell (APC)-T cell interactions. Results: Transcriptional analysis of T cells from BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 tumors at 1, 3, and 6 weeks revealed a decline in T cell-associated genes from 194 at 1 week to 156 at 6 weeks, with a significant late-stage loss of TCR diversity and contraction of natural killer T (NKT)- and {gamma}{delta} T cell-related transcripts. Cytokine and transcription factor dynamics reflected temporal T cell polarization: early (1 week) IL-12/{beta}-STAT4 signalling supports CD4+ type 1 T helper cell (Th1) and type 1 CD8+ cytotoxic T cell (Tc1) responses; intermediate (3 weeks) IL-21 and BCL6 expression suggest transient CD8+ cytotoxic follicular T cell (Tfc) skewing; and late (6 weeks) AhR and IL-1{beta} induction reflect interleukin 17/22 producing CD8+ T cell (Tc17/Tc22) transition. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines increased over time, while immunosuppressive mediators (e.g., IL-10) declined significantly. Antigen-presenting cell (APC)-T cell crosstalk deteriorated at 6 weeks, characterized by a reduction in the expression of co-stimulatory and APC genes. Despite an early dominance of M1-like macrophage signals (e.g., IL-12/{beta}), persistent expression of arginase 1 (ARG1) and other M2-associated genes indicated a stable tolerogenic niche. Conclusions: TNBC progression is characterized by progressive T cell functional decline, narrowing of TCR diversity, impaired APC-T cell interactions, and sustained macrophage-driven immunosuppression. These temporally coordinated immune shifts suggest tumor-driven adaptation toward immune evasion and identify potential windows for stage-specific immunotherapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Yet, the combined effects of polyploidy and diverse genetic makeup on plant responses to climate-induced stresses remain generally underexplored, particularly in annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), a major cool-season forage species. In a two-year controlled environment study, we assessed phenotypic responses of a wildtype and the cultivar 'Marshall' at diploid (2x = 14) and tetraploid (4x = 28) levels. Plants were grown under 540 and 800 ppm [CO2] and at full and 50% evapotranspiration regimes. Anatomical and physiological differences between populations and ploidy levels were limited. Despite genetic background, total biomass production increased by 44% from 540 to 800 ppm [CO2], driven by enhanced aboveground growth. While the 2x-wildtype showed a lower leaf-to-stem ratio (a proxy for forage quality) than 2x-Marshall, this gap diminished at the tetraploid condition. These differences, and the lack thereof, highlight the importance of considering both chromosome manipulation and the genetic sourcing of crop wild relatives to expand diversity in cultivated species. Our findings reveal that wild populations can achieve comparable productivity and efficiency to improved populations under climate-change induced environments, while contributing adaptive traits valuable for resilient cropping systems.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Growth assays and HPLC quantification revealed that free glutamine in LB decreased from 58 M to 12 M upon autoclaving, while heat-stable glutamine sources remained at 117 M. Similar growth defects were observed for {Delta}glnA in autoclaved BHI, TSB, and M17 media compared with their non-autoclaved counterparts.

While recent outbreaks have revealed much about the epidemiological dynamics that sustain human-to-human transmission, the mechanisms by which the virus persists between outbreaks are unknown. Previously, phylogenetic approaches have been used to characterise the EBOV reservoir from the evolutionary relationships among observed human outbreaks. We here employ a novel phylogenetic latency model -- inspired by recent observations of extreme EBOV evolutionary rate heterogeneity in humans -- to characterise the natural history of EBOV and by extension its reservoir. We find the prevailing model of EBOV reservoir dynamics is deficient, and the long-term EBOV evolutionary rate is slower than previously believed. The hypothesis that EBOV diversity dates back to a bottleneck event just prior to the first human outbreak is not supported by the data. Further, our results suggest that EBOV undergoes extended periods of quiescence in the reservoir, similar to that observed in a small fraction of human infections. These findings have significant implications for understanding the source of EBOV outbreaks, characterising the EBOV reservoir, and uncovering the factors that contribute to EBOV outbreaks in humans.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Detecting ancient hybridization is particularly challenging, as genomic signals may erode over time. The Malvatheca clade (Malvaceae), marked by multiple paleopolyploidy events since it's estimated origin 66 my, offers a useful model for examining RE. Its three subfamilies Bombacoideae (with high chromosome numbers, mostly trees), Malvoideae (lower chromosome numbers, mostly herbs), and the recently described Matisioideae show unresolved relationships, with several taxa of uncertain placement. We conducted a phylogenomic analysis of 62 Malvatheca species via complete plastomes, 35S rDNA cistrons, and comparative repeatome data. All datasets consistently resolved three main clades: (i) Bombacoideae, (ii) Malvoideae, and (iii) a heterogeneous assemblage including most of the recently assigned Matisioideae and several incertae sedis taxa, suggesting a more complex evolutionary history and circumscription than previously recognized. Chromosome numbers were negatively correlated with repeatome diversity: Bombacoideae presented higher counts but lower repeat diversity, possibly reflecting slower repeat evolution associated with woody growth forms. In contrast, clade III showed marked heterogeneity in both chromosome number and repeat composition, which is consistent with a reticulate origin. Overall, our results show evidence of ancient hybridization and polyploidy, predominantly allopolyploidy, in shaping Malvatheca evolution. These results highlight that reticulation and genome dynamics, rather than taxonomic boundaries alone, are central to understanding the diversification of Malvatheca.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

E.; Logares, R.", "abstract": "Background: The Gorgonian coral, Eunicella singularis, is one of the main components of Mediterranean marine animal forests, whose canopies play a key role in Mediterranean sublittoral ecosystems due to their capacity to provide shelter, food, and nursery ground to several species. Like other gorgonian species, E. singularis faces environmental threats with potential repercussions on the associated biodiversity. This photophilic octocoral, spanning the Western Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Aegean Seas at depths of 10-70m, engages in symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae dinoflagellates, thereby influencing their resilience in nutrient-poor habitats. However, mesophotic populations (~60m depth) are characterized by very low Symbiodiniaceae density, prompting questions regarding metabolic adaptations. The associations of corals with specific bacteria that differ from those in the surrounding seawater suggest a role in host health and physiology. In particular, in mesophotic colonies, bacteria may perform activities that Symbiodinium typically carries out in shallow colonies. Here, we applied metagenomics techniques to analyze the changes in the microbiome of Eunicella singularis with depth, analyzing DNA samples from shallow (12m) and mesophotic (57m) colonies in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Results: High-coverage metagenomes (ca. 80 Gb per sample) were generated from E. singularis colony samples. We observed significant changes in the relative abundance of prokaryotic and microbial eukaryotic symbionts with depth. Mesophotic samples exhibited higher levels of symbiotic prokaryotes, dominated by Endozoicomonas and Bermanella, whereas shallow samples were enriched with the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodiniaceae. The metabolic potential of the microbiome also varied with depth. The shallow microbiome showed a prevalence of photosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways. In turn, the mesophotic microbiome exhibited a higher abundance of metabolic functions related to vitamin biosynthesis, energy metabolism, especially carbon metabolism, as well as pathways associated with carbohydrates, amino acids, and cofactors. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the structure and metabolic function of the microbiome of Eunicella singularis change with depth. In the absence of symbiotic dinoflagellates, associated bacteria seem to use different sources of carbon, in addition to cycling nutrients and vitamins, which could influence coral health. These findings gain significance in the context of global change, as shifts in oceanic conditions may affect the coral microbiome.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Here we report an artificial multiphase system in which catalytically active droplets containing three distinct coexisting coacervate phases undergo reorganization in response to pH, enabling control over chemical reactions. Catalysis is performed by an inner, polyhistidine-dense coacervate phase with inherent nonenzymatic activity. We show how phase composition, in addition to pH, affects catalytic activity, and how the addition of enzymes that alter local pH provides a means to regulate composition and catalysis.

In addition, isotope tracing experiments provided new insights into the origin of the L-proline moiety.

J.; Kortemme, T.", "abstract": "The advent of generative models of protein structure has greatly accelerated our ability to perform de novo protein design, especially concerning design at coarser physical scales such as backbone generation and protein binder design. However, the design of precise placements at atomic scales remains a challenge for existing design methods. One avenue towards higher fidelity atomic-scale design is via generative models with full atomic resolution, but is complicated by the intricacies of simultaneously designing both discrete protein sequence and continuous atomic positionings. In this work we propose a framework to capture this interplay by decomposing residues into collections of oriented rigid bodies, allowing us to apply SE(3) flow matching for all-atom protein structure generation. Our method, ProteinZen, generates designs with high sequence-structure consistency while retaining competitive diversity and novelty on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks. We demonstrate competitive performance for unconditional monomer design and state-of-the-art performance on various forms of motif scaffolding, including full-atom motif scaffolding and motif scaffolding without specifying motif segment spacing or relative sequence order.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Medicago sp., an important forage crop, thrives under adverse conditions, such as drought, extreme temperatures (heat and cold), and salinity. Several studies have shed light on the regulatory pathways of cold/chilling stress tolerance in Medicago sp. in recent years. In the present study, we found that a cold-repressed transcription factor, MtCBF4, negatively regulates anthocyanin synthesis by directly repressing the expression of MtLAP1, a critical regulatory gene for anthocyanin synthesis in Medicago truncatula. It leads to the downregulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, and reduced anthocyanin accumulation. Apart from the transcriptional cascade, MtCBF4 exerts its effect through histone H3K27 trimethylation. It directly binds to the promoter of MtJMJ13, an H3K27me3 demethylase, to activate its expression, resulting in decreased H3K27 trimethylation. Furthermore, MtJMJ13 demethylates the gene body of MtCBF4 to positively regulate its expression, forming a positive feedback loop that functions in a cold-responsive manner. MtJMJ13 also demethylates the gene body of MtMYB2, MtKFB1, and MtKFB2 genes, which are negative regulators of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Altogether, we have unveiled a new regulatory loop involving a transcriptional regulator and a histone demethylase, operating together to limit anthocyanin production. This regulatory module is repressed under cold stress, leading to increased anthocyanin production and enhanced cold stress tolerance in M. truncatula.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

We show EGFR kinase inhibitors are not generally Mtb-restrictive in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Few EGFR inhibitors restrict intracellular Mtb and do so via heterogeneous mechanisms, including direct antibiotic effects and host-dependent, likely EGFR-independent mechanisms. During host-dependent therapy, intracellular Mtb induce defined, stress-responsive gene modules, with each drug inducing a unique combination of restriction-associated stresses. We decompose intracellular Mtb responses into host-dependent contributions and host-independent contributions suggestive of direct drug-Mtb interaction.

V.; Cepko, C.", "abstract": "The retina, our sensory organ for vision, displays distinct photoreceptor distributions and can have a specialized region for high visual acuity. The establishment of these spatial patterns during development depends on regionally restricted transcription factors and signaling molecules. Members of the T-box family of transcription factors, Tbx2, Tbx3, and Tbx5, show such restricted patterns of expression, with a dorsal high to ventral low pattern in the early retina. Their potential regulatory interactions and roles in patterning have not been fully explored. Here, we investigated their regulatory interactions by overexpression (OE) and knockdown (KD) approaches. We found that Tbx2, Tbx3, and Tbx5, directly or indirectly regulate each other as well as other early, patterned genes, including Fgf8, Cyp26a1, Cyp26c1, Cyp1b1, Raldh1, Ventroptin, and Bmp2. KD of any one of these Tbx genes increased rod photoreceptor density in a specific region of the retina, whereas Tbx2 loss additionally reduced the number of UV cones throughout the retina. Notably, KD of Tbx2, Tbx3, or Tbx5 consistently resulted in a smaller rod-free zone (RFZ), a domain within the high acuity area. These findings demonstrate that T-box transcription factors form a coordinated regulatory network that governs regional gene expression and photoreceptor patterning.

Using this method, we determined energy efficiency, dynamic membrane composition, oxidative stress response, and proper protein folding to be extremely important for survival in drinking water systems. Additionally, multiple antibiotic resistance genes are expressed and upregulated in the intracellular RNA fraction, indicating selection pressure.

These structures regulate gene expression but also serve as mutation hotspots and are linked to cancer. Because non-B DNA is difficult to sequence, its annotations have been incomplete in most genome assemblies. Telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies now overcome this limitation. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of eight types of non-B DNA motifs (e.g., G-quadruplexes and Z-DNA) in the zebra finch T2T genome. Motif content varied strongly by chromosome categories; gene-rich dot chromosomes showed the highest motif levels (22.8-40.5%), microchromosomes intermediate levels (9.8-24.8%), and macrochromosomes the lowest (9.1-10.1%). Within chromosomes, Z-DNA was enriched at centromeres, and G-quadruplexes were enriched at promoters and 5'UTRs. Low methylation at G-quadruplexes suggests they can form and contribute to gene regulation in these regions. Comparable patterns of non-B DNA distribution were observed in the near T2T chicken genome, except that A-phased repeats and not Z-DNA were enriched at chicken centromeres. Overall, our findings indicate that the non-B DNA distribution reflects the distinctive architecture of avian genomes, implicating non-canonical DNA in gene expression and centromere organization. The unusually high density on dot chromosomes is negatively correlated with PacBio sequencing depth, and thus helps explain why these chromosomes have posed exceptional challenges for sequencing.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

Although recognized as a prime therapeutic target in colorectal cancer (CRC) for three decades, its dynamic architecture and biochemical complexity have hindered mechanistic understanding. Here, we systematically mapped the sequence-function landscape of the BDC using tiled base editor screens across four endogenous components--CTNNB1, AXIN1, APC, and GSK3B. Validation studies identified ~150 previously unreported mutations across these genes that affected WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling. In addition to known cancer-associated mutations, we discovered rare gain-of-function and separation-of-function alleles of AXIN1 and CTNNB1 that provide mechanistic insights into complex assembly and regulation. We describe a region in {beta}-catenin that regulates its binding to TCF/LEF transcription factors and demonstrate that the AXIN1-{beta}-catenin interface is critical for controlling signaling flux through the oncogenic BDC. Mechanistic studies revealed that assembly of the oncogenic BDC is scaffolded by its own substrate {beta}-catenin, establishing an autoregulatory mechanism that represents an unexploited vulnerability in cancers harboring common APC truncations.

Traditional single-point Tg measurements fail to account for metabolic fluctuations occurring throughout HDL particle lifespan. Objective: To derive and validate a mathematical equation estimating time-weighted average Tg exposure based on HDL particle kinetics. Methods: We developed HDLTg through kinetic modeling incorporating HDL residence time (time +/- 5 days) and lipid exchange dynamics. The equation HDLTg = 42.5 . (Total Tg/HDL-cholesterol) was calibrated using regression analysis and validated across laboratory tests of 1,247 subjects stratified by metabolic phenotype. Comparative analyses employed receiver operating characteristic curves and correlation coefficients against established biomarkers. Results: HDLTg demonstrated superior predictive performance versus fasting Tg for metabolic syndrome development (AUC 0.824 vs. 0.742;AUC = 0.082, p = 0.003) with 12.4% net reclassification improvement (p = 0.008). Strong correlations emerged with Tg-glucose index (r = 0.856) and seven-day Tg averaging (r = 0.867). Population stratification revealed progressive elevation: healthy controls 78.4 +/- 18.6 mg/dL, prediabetes 118.7 +/-31.4 mg/dL, metabolic syndrome 167.9 +/- 45.2 mg/dL, diabetes 203.6 +/- 58.7 mg/dL (p < 0.001).

It serves as an adhesive, lubricant, signaling molecule, and spatial filler without which embryogenesis would not complete. HA is synthesized by a membrane-integrated glycosyltransferase (HAS) that polymerizes UDP-activated N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid (GlcA) in an alternating fashion. The nascent HA chain is secreted across the plasma membrane during this process. How HAS couples these tasks remains poorly understood. Here, we employ a combination of structural biology, biochemistry and glycobiology to delineate how HAS recognizes and utilizes UDP-GlcA. Using single-particle cryo-EM, we reveal a two-step process by which HAS binds its substrate UDP-GlcA. Prior to proper insertion into the catalytic pocket, the substrate is bound in a proofreading pose that may increase substrate selectivity. This state is accompanied by conformational changes of active site residues surrounding the UDP-binding pocket and involves a pair of basic residues that sense the substrates carboxyl group. Further, we establish that HAS is unable to catalyze UDP-GlcA turnover in the absence of an acceptor sugar, emphasizing the role of a priming GlcNAc in glycosyl transfer. Lastly, cryo-EM snapshots of a dodecylmaltoside molecule trapped in the active site provide novel insights into substrate promiscuity.

This coordination is thought to depend on microtubules responding to mechanical stress orientations. Here we test this stress-sensing hypothesis by quantifying microtubule behaviours on different faces and edges of growing leaf cells. We show that microtubules orientations exhibit both cell-geometric and tissue biases. Stress sensing can account for tissue biases but not microtubule trajectories and densities. An alternative hypothesis is suggested by two edge behaviours: generation of microtubules within cell edges and a filter that prevents microtubules entering side faces at shallow angles. Incorporating these features into a combinatorial model in which cell face identities modulate microtubule behaviours, accounts for tissue coordination and observed dynamics. Thus, instead of orientations being sensed at the microtubule level, they are sensed at the cellular level through changes in statistical behaviours at cell faces and edges, coordinated across a tissue through cell polarity.", "date": "2025-10-18", "journal": ""}

By decomposing the Objective Function Value (OFV), we identify scenarios where parameter fixing leads to non-continuous likelihood behavior, potentially invalidating the LRT application. A proof and numerical examples illustrate that while fixing population parameters maintains continuity through compensatory behavior of terms within the OFV, fixing individual parameters introduces discontinuities. Overall, this work underscores the need for careful consideration of parameter fixation in population models: It shows that population parameters can be fixed without violating the continuity condition for LRTs and suggests that introducing covariates may provide a viable alternative for fixing individual parameters.

The unusually large MH domain bears hallmarks of metzincins but is distinguished by several unique features including an atypical active site zinc-coordination environment and a second Zn2+ -coordination site.
