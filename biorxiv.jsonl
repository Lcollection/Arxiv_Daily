Here, we demonstrated that NVC actively modulates stress-induced negative emotions. We established bidirectional manipulations of NVC in freely moving mice by employing integrated pharmacological, genetic, and arteriolar optogenetic approaches. Our results showed that both systemic and basolateral amygdala (BLA) regional specific NVC deficiencies heightened emotional responses when mice transitioned from a home cage to anxiogenic environments, and local restoration of NVC in the BLA normalized these responses. Furthermore, by combining BLA neuronal activity mapping with behavioral measures of responses to various stressors, we revealed that the spatial patterns of BLA neuronal activation predicted emotional response magnitudes, with hyper- and hypoactive BLA predicting heightened and blunted behavioral responses, respectively, in the NVC-deficient mice. Finally, enhancing NVC, achieved through either pharmacological or genetic manipulations, promoted resilience to chronic-stress-induced NVC impairments and alleviated emotional distress. These findings established NVC as an allostatic program for fine-tuning emotional responses, with implications for understanding and treating emotional disorders.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Our computational analysis, complemented by experimental validations, including genetic screening, multi-omics, site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical assays, and physiological readouts, identified endogenous hydrophobic metabolites, notably sterols, as direct intracellular allosteric modulators of Ste2p. Molecular simulations coupled with biochemical signaling assessment in site-directed Ste2p mutants further confirmed that metabolites binding to GPCR-G obstruct downstream signaling, possibly via a cohesive effect. Finally, by utilizing isoproterenol-induced, GPCR-mediated human and neonatal rat cardiac hypertrophy models, we observed that elevated metabolite levels attenuate hypertrophic response, reinforcing the evolutionary relevance of this mechanism.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

AdaptiveFlow provides free access to a screening-ready version of the Enamine REAL Space, the largest library of ready-to-dock, drug-like molecules, containing 69 billion compounds that we prepared using the ligand preparation module of the platform. A key innovation of the platform is its use of a multi-dimensional grid of molecular properties, which helps researchers explore and prioritize chemical space more effectively and reduce the computational costs by a factor of approximately 1000. This grid forms the basis of a new method for identifying promising regions of chemical space, enabling systematic exploration and prioritization of compound libraries. An optional active learning component can further accelerate this process by adaptively steering the search toward molecules most likely to bind a given target. To support a broad range of applications, AdaptiveFlow is compatible with over 1,500 docking methods. The platform achieves near-linear scaling on up to 5.6 million CPUs in the AWS Cloud, setting a new benchmark for large-scale cloud computing in drug discovery. Using this approach, we identified nanomolar inhibitors of two disease-relevant targets: ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1). By leveraging newly solved crystal structures of FSP1 in complex with NAD+, FAD, and coenzyme Q1, we validated these hits experimentally and determined the first co-crystal structures of FSP1 bound to small-molecule inhibitors, enabling insights into inhibitor binding mechanisms previously unknown.

Existing computational tools, however, primarily focus on predicting transcript 3' ends generated by Rho-independent terminators (RITs) in model species, leaving significant gaps in understanding those generated by Rho-dependent terminators (RDTs), especially in non-model species. To address these limitations, we developed BATTER (BActeria Transcript Three Prime End Recognizer), a comprehensive computational tool for bacterial transcript 3' termini prediction. BATTER builds on the observation that conserved stem-loop structures are frequently associated with 3' ends of primary transcripts generated by both RIT and RDT mechanisms across distantly related bacterial species. BATTER demonstrated its advantage compared to existing tools. It enabled a comprehensive analysis of 42,905 representative bacterial genomes, uncovering that stem-loop structures exhibit clade-specific properties with greater variations between species than between gene families. Notably, BATTER uncovered that certain Cyanobacteria lineages, despite lacking Rho homologs, harbor Rho utilization (RUT) site-like sequences near 3' ends, with preliminary experimental validation in E. coli suggesting their partial functionality in transcription termination. Additionally, BATTER systematically identified pervasive premature termination events in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, highlighting their regulatory roles in translation protection and drug efflux.

As proximity to humans is an important risk factor for pathogen transmission, anthropogenic roosting may have important consequences for predicting virus spillover and spillback of viruses. For bats, the influence of roosting in anthropogenic structures on predicting virus hosting ability and diversity is poorly understood. Using machine learning, we analyze novel roosting ecology data to assess the importance of anthropogenic roosting in predicting viral outcomes and evaluate how this trait affects the prediction of undetected but likely host species. The importance of anthropogenic roosting varies across viral outcomes, being most important for virus hosting ability and less so for zoonotic virus hosting ability, viral richness, and the proportion of zoonotic viruses harbored by bats. Across viral outcomes, anthropogenic roosting is less important than human population density but more important than most family, diet, and foraging traits. Models with anthropogenic roosting extended the list of undetected zoonotic host species compared to models excluding this trait. Predicted virus host distributions show distinct spatial patterns between anthropogenic and natural roosting bats.

Both genomics and transcriptomics variation have been attributed to such a process, in which gene families with functions associated with host localization, acceptance, and usage have been proposed to evolve. In this context, cactophilic Drosophila species are an excellent model to study host shift evolution, since they use a wide range of cacti as hosts, and many species have different preferences. Transposable elements are engines of genetic novelty between populations and species, driving rapid adaptive evolution. However, the extent of TEs' contribution to host shift remains unexplored. We performed genomic and transcriptomic analyses in six genomes of cactophilic species/subspecies to investigate how TEs interact with genes associated with host shift. Our results revealed enrichment of TEs at promoter regions of host shift-related genes, with ~39% of the odorant receptors containing their transcription factor binding sites within TEs. We observed that ~50% of these TEs are Helitrons, demonstrating an unprecedented putative cis-regulatory role of Helitrons in Drosophila. Differential expression analysis between species with different preferred hosts revealed divergence in gene expression in head and larval tissues. Although TEs' presence does not affect overall gene expression, we observed 6.27% of the expressed genes generating gene-TE chimeric transcripts, including those with function affecting host preference.

Diagnosis involves assessing optic cupping (increased cup-to-disc ratios) and structural changes (like retinal nerve fiber layer thinning) through clinical imaging. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is commonly associated with glaucoma, but not always. However, understanding disease progression is hindered by limited access to donor ocular tissue and consistent clinical data. Our study focuses on live patient samples, analyzing their proteome for potential biomarkers to enhance precise diagnosis and monitor glaucoma progression. Methods: Aqueous humor (AH) samples were collected from 36 glaucoma patients (17 male, 19 female), and 35 non-glaucomatous control patients (16 male, 19 female) undergoing cataract surgery. The protein profile was compared using the SOMAscan assay system for proteome profiling. From glaucomatous donors, significant correlations between IOP and cup-to-disc ratios to proteome differences were identified. Results: Correlations in proteins between plasma and AH were identified. These proteins were enriched in pathways related to vascular integrity, inflammatory response, humoral & adaptive immune response, cell-cell & cell-matrix adhesion, and complement activation. Glaucomatous AH exhibited increased protein levels in general. Neurofilament light chain (NEFL) protein correlated with elevated IOP and inflammatory markers, but not with cup-to-disc ratios. Conclusions: Together, our data demonstrate that the proteins identified in this study from glaucomatous donors correspond to both markers of neurodegeneration and those that may inhibit cell proliferation or disrupt vascular integrity.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

However, whether memory retrieval facilitates update mechanisms other than memory reconsolidation remains unclear. We tested this hypothesis in three experiments with healthy human participants. First, we demonstrate that memory retrieval-extinction protocol prevents the return of fear expression shortly after extinction training and this short-term effect is memory reactivation dependent (Study 1, N = 57 adults). Furthermore, across different timescales, the memory retrieval-extinction paradigm triggers distinct types of fear amnesia in terms of cue-specificity and cognitive control dependence, suggesting that the short-term fear amnesia might be caused by different mechanisms from the cue-specific amnesia at a longer and separable timescale (Study 2, N = 79 adults). Finally, using continuous theta-burst stimulation (Study 3, N = 75 adults), we directly manipulated brain activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and found that both memory reactivation and intact prefrontal cortex function were necessary for the short-term fear amnesia after the retrieval-extinction protocol. The differences in temporal scale, cue-specificity, and cognitive control ability dependence between the short- and long-term amnesia suggest that memory retrieval and extinction training trigger distinct underlying memory update mechanisms. These findings suggest the potential involvement of coordinated memory modulation processes upon memory retrieval and may inform clinical approaches for addressing persistent maladaptive memories.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Given the integral role of RNA, its repair is essential for maintaining proper cell function. A highly conserved RNA repair system, the Rtc system, maintains core RNA components of the translational apparatus. In E. coli, Rtc expression is induced upon various stresses, including exposure to ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Its expression enables cells to rescue growth and survive treatment by conferring transient resistance to these antibiotics. The mechanisms by which Rtc-induced resistance arises are largely unknown. Here, we develop and analyse a computational model of Rtc-regulated maintenance of long-lived RNAs that form part of the translational apparatus. Our model analysis and experimental validation provide evidence of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in rtc expression and effects on the translational capacity of cells, indicating that individual cell fates determine antibiotic efficacy and thus rtc may induce a form of heteroresistance. Through further analysis and quantification of single-cell ribosome levels, we then identify targets within the Rtc system that can reduce translational capacity of cells, rendering cells more susceptible and so potentiating antibiotic effects. Our results provide novel tools for the systems analysis of Rtc-regulated RNA repair, they reveal a complex response underpinning resistance conferred by the innate repair system, and they suggest novel avenues to address resistance in E. coli and related clinical pathogens.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

For this task we introduce bioIB, a method based on the Information Bottleneck algorithm, designed to extract an optimal compressed representation of scRNA-seq data with respect to a desired biological signal, such as cell type or disease state. BioIB generates a hierarchy of weighted gene clusters, termed metagenes, that maximize the information regarding the signal of interest. Applying bioIB to a scRNA-seq atlas of differentiating macrophages and setting either the organ-of-origin or the developmental stage as the signal of interest provided two distinct signal-specific sets of metagenes that captured the attributes of the respective signal. BioIB's representation can also be used to expose specific cellular subpopulations, for example, when applied to a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing dataset of an Alzheimer's Disease mouse model, it identified a subpopulation of disease-associated astrocytes.

This poses a critical challenge: How does the olfactory system maintain stable representations of odors and therefore allow for stable sensory perceptions amidst this ongoing circuit instability? Utilizing a detailed spiking network model of early olfactory circuits, we uncovered dual roles for adult-neurogenesis: one that both supports representational stability to faithfully encode odor information and also one that facilitates plasticity to allow for learning and adaptation. In the main olfactory bulb, adult-neurogenesis affects neural codes in individual mitral and tufted cells but preserves odor representations at the neuronal population level. By contrast, in the olfactory piriform cortex, both individual cell responses and overall population dynamics undergo progressive changes due to adult-neurogenesis. This leads to representational drift, a gradual alteration in sensory perception. Both processes are dynamic and depend on experience such that repeated exposure to specific odors reduces the drift due to adult-neurogenesis; thus, when the odor environment is stable over the course of adult-neurogenesis, it is neurogenesis that actually allows the representations to remain stable in piriform cortex; when those olfactory environments change, adult-neurogenesis allows the cortical representations to track environmental change. Whereas perceptual stability and plasticity due to learning are often thought of as two distinct, often contradictory processing in neuronal coding, we find that adult-neurogenesis serves as a shared mechanism for both. In this regard, adult-neurogenesis in the mammalian olfactory bulb that has been the focus of considerable study in chemosensory neuroscience may be the mechanistic underpinning behind an array of complex computations.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Phenological shifts are one strategy, as species move their activity or life history events in time to avoid extreme conditions. Species may also shift in space, moving their ranges poleward to escape extremes. However, whether species are more likely to exhibit one or both strategies, and whether this can be predicted based on a species' functional traits, is unknown. Using a powerful macroecological dataset of European and North American odonate observations, we assessed range and phenology shifts between two time periods (1980-2002 and 2008-2018) to measure the strength and direction of the association between responses. Species with the greatest poleward range shifts also showed the largest phenological shifts toward earlier annual activity periods, with half of all species shifting in both space and time. This response was consistent across continents, despite highly divergent land use and biogeographical histories in these regions. Surprisingly, species' range and phenology shifts were not related to functional traits; rather, southern species shifted their range limits more strongly, while increasing temperature variability hindered range shifts. By reducing risk through phenological shifts, the resulting larger populations may be more likely to disperse and expand species' ranges. Species shifting in both space and time may be more resilient to extreme conditions, although further work integrating abundance data is needed. We also identified a small number of species (approximately 10%) that failed to shift at all; these species are likely to be particularly vulnerable to climate change, and should be prioritized for conservation intervention.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Based on intensive plant samplings performed in Spain, Italy and Morocco at different periods between the 1990s and 2014, several begomoviruses (family Geminiviridae) were identified as the cause of TYLCD. They comprise the native Begomovirus solanumflavusardiniaense (Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus, TYLCSAV), two strains of Begomovirus coheni (Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, TYLCV) introduced from the Middle East, and several types of TYLCV/TYLCSaV recombinants including the invasive recombinant TYLCV-IS76 in which the genome fragment inherited from TYLCSaV was unusually short. Although parental and recombinant TYLCD-associated begomoviruses were present in each country, country specificities were detected with respect to their relative prevalence, the infection profiles of individual tomato plants, and the recombination patterns of TYLCV/TYLCSaV recombinants. Considering geographic proximities and trade activities between these countries, and the efficient transmission of begomoviruses which are persistently transmitted by the polyphagous and tiny whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci, it was not known if these specificities would be maintained over time. To address this question, 105 tomato samples collected in the three countries between 2015 and 2019 were analysed with PCR tests previously designed to distinguish species, strains and recombinants of TYLCD associated begomoviruses, and with an original PCR test distinguishing emerging resistance-breaking recombinants bearing short TYLCSaV-inherited fragments like TYLCV-IS76 (Srec) from formerly reported recombinants with longer TYLCSaV fragments (Lrec). The results show that country specificities are still present, the most striking being the contrasted geographic distribution of Srec recombinants, with TYLCV-IS76 detected in Morocco but not in Italy, and TYLCV-IS141 and a new Srec recombinant (TYLCV-IMS60-2400) both detected in Italy and not in Morocco. Nevertheless, besides country specificities, a general population shift was revealed regarding TYLCV/TYLCSaV recombinants. Indeed, all the recombinant positive samples, irrespective of their geographic origin, were Srec-positive but Lrec-negative, which suggest that the emergence of Srec recombinants occurred at the expenses of the Lrec recombinants.

This photoacoustic stimulation robustly and locally modulated retinal ganglion cell activity in both wild-type and degenerated ex vivo rat retinae. In animals subretinally implanted with a millimeter-sized photoacoustic film, pulsed laser stimulation generated neural modulation along the visual pathway to the superior colliculus, as measured by functional ultrasound imaging.

X.", "abstract": "Species' distributions and abundances are shifting in response to climate change. Most species harbor microbial symbionts that have the potential to influence these responses. Mutualistic microbial symbionts may provide resilience to environmental change by protecting their hosts from increasing stress. However, environmental change that disrupts these interactions may lead to declines in hosts or symbionts. Microbes preserved within herbarium specimens offer a unique opportunity to quantify changes in microbial symbiosis across broad temporal and spatial scales. We asked how the prevalence of seed-transmitted fungal symbionts of grasses (Epichloe endophytes), which can protect hosts from abiotic stress, have changed over time in response to climate change, and how these changes vary across host species' ranges. Specifically, we analyzed 2,346 herbarium specimens of three grass host species collected over the last two centuries (1824 -- 2019) for the presence or absence of endophyte symbiosis, and evaluated spatial and temporal trends in endophyte prevalence. We found that endophytes increased in prevalence over the last two centuries from ca. 25% prevalence to ca. 75% prevalence, on average, across three host species. We also found that changes in prevalence were associated with observed changes in seasonal climate drivers; notably increasing precipitation corresponding to each host species' peak growing season and changes in off-peak season variability in precipitation. Our analysis performed favorably in an out-of-sample predictive test with contemporary data, however we identified greater local-scale variability in endophyte prevalence in contemporary data compared to historic data, suggesting that model fusion may be an important step moving forward. Our results provide novel evidence for a cryptic biological response to climate change that may contribute to the resilience of host-microbe symbiosis through context-dependent benefits that confer a fitness advantage to symbiotic hosts under environmental change.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Background: A useful concept in microbial ecology is the 'core microbiome.' Typically, core microbiomes are defined as the microbial taxa, genes, or functions shared by a threshold number of microbiome samples from a particular type of habitat (e.g., a particular type of host or a particular type of environment/ecosystem). In defining the core microbiome, the goal is to capture the portion of the microbial community that is conserved across samples from the focal habitat. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing methods to better characterize core microbiomes. As a result, numerous occurrence- and abundance-based measures have been defined. However, few have included phylogeny-aware metrics for analyzing core microbiomes. Results: In this paper, we develop the concept of the 'core community phylogeny' - a phylogeny where branches are selected based on their presence in multiple samples from a single type of habitat. We then use the core community phylogeny to define phylogenetic metrics describing the diversity of core microbiomes from a single type of habitat, the turnover between core microbiomes from two different types of habitats, and the shared diversity across core microbiomes from two or more different types of habitats. As compared to non-phylogenetic metrics, our phylogenetic metrics show greater consistency across taxonomic rank and/or phylogenetic level, as well as less sensitivity to strain variation across microbiome samples. Thus, our metrics address key challenges in the interpretation of core microbiomes. Conclusions: We provide a phylogenetic framework for characterizing and comparing core microbiomes. Importantly, the methods that we propose allow seamless integration of microbiome properties across taxonomic rank and/or phylogenetic level. Ultimately, this will provide both a more consistent picture of the core microbiome, as well as novel biological insight into the conserved components of microbial communities.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

We present a multimodal, single-cell resolution analysis of mouse limbal cells (includes TM). In total, we sequenced 9,394 wild-type TM cell transcriptomes. We discovered three TM cell subtypes with characteristic signature genes validated by immunofluorescence on tissue sections and whole-mounts. The subtypes are robust, being detected in datasets for two diverse mouse strains and in independent data from two institutions. Results show compartmentalized enrichment of critical pathways in specific TM cell subtypes. Distinctive signatures include increased expression of genes responsible for 1) extracellular matrix structure and metabolism (TM1 subtype), 2) secreted ligand signaling to support Schlemm's canal cells (TM2), and 3) contractile and mitochondrial/metabolic activity (TM3). ATAC-sequencing data identified active transcription factors in TM cells, including LMX1B. Mutations in LMX1B cause high IOP and glaucoma. LMX1B is emerging as a key transcription factor for normal mitochondrial function and its expression is much higher in TM3 cells than other limbal cells. To understand the role of LMX1B in TM function and glaucoma, we single-cell sequenced limbal cells from Lmx1bV265D/+ mutant mice (2,491 TM cells). In V265D/+ mice, TM3 cells were uniquely affected by pronounced mitochondrial pathway changes. Mitochondria in TM cells of V265D/+ mice are swollen with a reduced cristae area, further supporting a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the initiation of IOP elevation in these mice. Importantly, treatment with vitamin B3 (nicotinamide), to enhance mitochondrial function and metabolic resilience, significantly protected Lmx1b mutant mice from IOP elevation.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Sec insertion occurs in response to UGA, normally interpreted as stop codon, but recoded in selenoprotein mRNAs. Owing to the dual function of UGA, the identification of selenoprotein genes poses a challenge. We show that the vertebrate selenoprotein genes are widely misannotated in major public databases. Only 12% and 6% of selenoprotein genes are well annotated in Ensembl and NCBI GenBank, respectively, due to the lack of dedicated selenoprotein annotation pipelines. In most cases (81% and 84%), overlapping flawed annotations are present which lack the Sec-encoding UGA. In contrast, NCBI RefSeq employs a dedicated selenoprotein pipeline, yet with some shortcomings: its selenoprotein annotations are correct in 76% of cases, and most errors affect families with a C-terminal Sec residue. We argue that selenoproteins must be correctly annotated in public databases and that must occur via automated pipelines, to keep the pace with genome sequencing. To facilitate this task, we present a new version of Selenoprofiles, an homology based tool for selenoprotein prediction that produces predictions with accuracy comparable to manual curation, and can be easily deployed and integrated in existing annotation pipelines.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

In this study, we compared 13 previously isolated Escherichia coli phages based on physiological characteristics, whole-genome sequences, and tail fiber protein phylogenetics. We improved our previously proposed physiological clustering method by optimizing the bacterial panel for host range assessment, implementing appropriate distance metrics for mixed data types, and applying silhouette coefficient analysis for objective determination of optimal cluster numbers. We combined genomic analysis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structural analysis of phage-resistant E. coli strains to identify target receptors of the phages. Complementation experiments further confirmed the direct involvement of identified genes in phage reception. The results revealed that phylogenetically distinct E. coli phages target different sites in the LPS R-core region (modified by WaaV, WaaW, WaaT, and WaaY), membrane proteins (NfrB, TolA, YhaH), or flagella. Our analysis revealed that, subtle chemical modifications of LPS (such as Heptose phosphorylation) were shown to be important for E. coli phage recognition. Furthermore, physiological characteristics, tail fiber phylogenetics, and whole genome analysis independently classified the phages with high correlation to target receptor specificity. The addition of three phages with known receptors further validated our approach. Our results suggest that grouping based on physiological characteristics (such as lysis dynamics and host range) phage phenotypes and genotypes (tail fiber phylogenetics or whole genome analysis) are closely related independently classified phages with high correlation to target receptor specificity.

BR signaling is primarily influenced by the plasma membrane abundance of the BR receptor BR INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), a process regulated by ubiquitination, endocytosis, and protein degradation.

In this study, we show that the conserved eukaryotic regulatory proteins 14-3-3 directly interact with BRI1 at Threonine 872 (T872) within its juxtamembrane domain. Furthermore, phosphorylation at Serine 858 (S858) in BRI1's juxtamembrane domain enhances T872 phosphorylation, facilitating 14-3-3 protein binding. Consequently, by inhibiting BRI1 ubiquitination without affecting its kinase activity or BAK1 interaction, 14-3-3 binding increased BRI1 plasma membrane abundance and enhanced BR signaling. Both non-epsilon and epsilon isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins contribute to the regulation of BRI1 and, consequently, to plant responsiveness to BRs.

As of mid-2025 the epidemic is ongoing, resulting in spillbacks into poultry, wild birds and other mammals including humans2. Here, we present molecular and virological evidence that the cattle B3.13 genotype H5N1 viruses rapidly accumulated adaptations in polymerase genes that enabled better replication in bovine cells and tissues, as well as cells of other mammalian species including humans and pigs. We find evidence of several mammalian adaptations gained early in the evolution of these viruses in cattle including PB2 M631L, which is found in all cattle sequences, and PA K497R, which is found in the majority. Structurally, PB2 M631L maps to the polymerase-ANP32 interface, an essential host factor for viral genome replication. We show that this mutation adapts the polymerase to better interact with bovine ANP32 proteins, particularly ANP32A, and thereby enhances virus replication in bovine mammary systems and primary human airway cultures. Importantly, we show that ongoing evolution during 2024 and 2025 in the PB2 gene, including E627K and a convergently arising D740N substitution, further increase polymerase activity and virus replication in a range of mammalian cells. Thus, the continued circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle not only allows virus adaption improving replicative ability in cattle but also increases the risk of zoonotic spillover.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Cool-acclimated embryos showed a homeostatic response characterized by increased accessibility at binding motifs for the transcriptional activator Zelda, along with enhanced activity of gene regulatory networks in a subset of primordial cell types including the gut, muscle, and nervous system.

But for unknown reasons, different species of flies (Diptera) establish the AP axis through unrelated, structurally distinct anterior determinants (ADs). The AD of Drosophila, Bicoid (Bcd), initiates symmetry-breaking during nuclear cleavage cycles (NCs) when ubiquitous pioneer factors, such as Zelda (Zld), drive zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the level chromatin accessibility by nucleosome depletion. While Bcd engages in a concentration-dependent competition with nucleosomes at the loci of a small set of transcription factor (TF) genes that are expressed in the anterior embryo, it remains unknown whether unrelated ADs of other fly species function in the same way and target homologous genes. We have examined the symmetry-breaking mechanism of a moth fly, Clogmia albipunctata, in which a maternally expressed transcript isoform of the pair-rule segmentation gene odd-paired serves as AD. We provide a de novo assembly and annotation of the Clogmia genome and describe how Clogmia's orthologs of zelda (Cal-zld) and odd-paired (Cal-opa) affect chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Our results suggest direct roles of Cal-zld in opening and closing chromatin during nuclear cleavage cycles (NCs) and show that during the early phase of ZGA maternal Cal-opa activity promotes chromatin accessibility and anterior expression at Clogmia's homeobrain and sloppy-paired loci. These genes are not known as key targets of Bcd but may serve a more widely conserved role in the initiation of anterior pattern formation given their early anterior expression and function in head development in insects.

Particularly, some tadpoles in the genus Dryophytes in the Americas develop deep tail fins and bright orange tail coloration in response to predators such as dragonfly nymphs. These conspicuous tails are hypothesized to attract predator attacks, protecting vital body parts from fatal injuries. However, it remains unclear whether the extent of the induced phenotypic changes differs between various predators with distinct feeding patterns and habitats. To explore this, we reared tadpoles of the East Japan tree frog, Dryophytes leopardus, with four dragonfly species, water bug, water scorpion, or newt, and measured phenotypic changes, especially focusing on tail coloration. We found that the aeshnid Anax nigrofasciatus, a sit-and-wait predator that climbs on aquatic vegetation, induced bright orange and broad tails of tadpoles. Other odonate species that forage in and on the substrate also elicited tail coloration or deeper larval tails, but it took more time to induce the tadpoles' response compared to A. nigrofasciatus. In contrast, non-odonate predators did not induce color and morphological changes. This study provides the first evidence of predator-induced tail coloration in an Asian species of Dryophytes, which appears to be a defensive response specifically to dragonfly nymphs, as visually adept predators. Moreover, the differences in the extent and timing of the phenotypic changes among odonate species suggest that anti-predator phenotypes are modulated based on relative predation risks, considering the predators' foraging patterns and visual capabilities, thereby allowing tadpoles to minimize physiological costs and unintended risks associated with the induced traits.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Methods: 5-6m thick fixed and paraffin-embedded transverse midbrain tissue sections were supplied from 47 cases from three brain banks following ethics approvals. Sections were prepared and automated digital images acquired. Standardisation and automation of the quantification of neuromelanin granules was performed using the TruAI feature of the Olympus VS200 desktop platform. Comparisons between stained and unstained sections as well as correlations with age were performed. Results: The automated platform reliably identified both stained and unstained intracellular and extracellular neuromelanin granules, showing high reproducibility in measurements across laboratories using different tissue processing methods. Extracellular neuromelanin granules were significantly smaller than intracellular neuromelanin granules. Sections processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining impacted on size and colour of both neuromelanin and the neurons containing neuromelanin. Hematoxylin made neuromelanin bluer and the increased tissue processing made the intracellular area occupied by neuromelanin smaller in younger people. There was an increase in neuromelanin optical density and colour change (more brown) with age. Conclusions: The TruAI automated platform reliably quantifies individual neuromelanin granules in catecholamine neurons. Extracellular neuromelanin is considerably smaller in size than intracellular neuromelanin, and intracellular neuromelanin changes its properties with age. The darkening and colour change of intracellular neuromelanin suggests an increase in eumelanin over time in healthy individuals.

In the lymph nodes, naive B and T lymphocytes encounter cognate antigens, sparking their activation and response to foreign substances. Lymph nodes grow in response to an immune challenge, at least in part to accommodate increased numbers of infiltrating and proliferating B and T lymphocytes. This behavior is supported by a robust three-dimensional network of extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers and fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). ECM fibers and FRCs work synergistically to alternate stretching and contractile forces between them allowing the lymph node to maintain structural integrity during rapid tissue reconstruction. These changes ultimately alter the material properties of the lymph node, which can impact cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Recent work has investigated the physiological implications of the changing lymph node microenvironment; however, the biophysical properties of the lymph nodes during these changes remain largely unexplored. Here, we use multiple particle tracking microrheology (MPT), a minimally invasive nanoparticle-based technique to investigate the biophysical properties (elastic/loss moduli, microviscosity, pore size) of lymph nodes post inflammatory stimulus. Our results highlight mechanical changes both during the initial phases of the acute inflammatory response and upon resolution of inflammation, a topic that is relatively understudied. We show that B and T cell rich areas exhibit comparable changes in biomechanical properties over time, suggesting that they restructure in a similar fashion during acute inflammation. Additionally, for the first time, we show that biological sex modulates lymph node biomechanics in acute inflammation: Lymph nodes from female mice showed a ~20-fold increase in elastic and loss moduli at peak inflammation, while lymph nodes from male mice had a ~5-fold decrease in both moduli. Additionally, lymph nodes from female mice appeared to permanently remodel during the resolution of acute inflammation resulting in the maintenance of an overall higher elastic and loss modulus, while lymph nodes from male mice returned to the biomechanics of untreated lymph nodes. We also found that at least some of the changes in biomechanical properties were correlated with changes in ECM materials in the lymph nodes, suggesting a structure-function relationship. Overall, our studies provide key insights into how biomechanical properties in lymph nodes are altered during inflammation, a previously unstudied area, and lay the foundation for structure-function relationships involved in immune response. Additionally, we demonstrate a robust technique for the analysis of the lymph node interstitial tissue properties and how they vary with inflammatory stimuli.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

We predict age and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score as examples of a demographic and a clinical variable. We propose a machine-learning model inspired by graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which takes a brain connectivity graph as input and processes the data separately through a parallel GCN mechanism with multiple branches. The novelty of our work lies in the model architecture, especially the connectivity attention module, which learns an embedding representation of brain graphs while providing graph- level attention. We show experiments on publicly available datasets of PREVENT-AD and OASIS3. We validate our model by comparing it to existing methods and via ablations. This quantifies the degree to which the connectome varies depending on the task, which is important for improving our understanding of health and disease across the population.

To define the regulatory molecules governing chondrocyte aging, we performed transcriptomic analysis of young and old human chondrocytes from healthy donors. The data predicted that GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) may play a key role in mediating the difference between young and old chondrocytes. Results from immunostaining and western blot showed significantly higher GATA4 levels in old human or mouse chondrocytes when compared to young cells. Moreover, overexpressing GATA4 in young chondrocytes remarkably reduced their cartilage-forming capacity in vitro and induced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Conversely, suppressing GATA4 expression in old chondrocytes, through either siRNA or a small-molecule inhibitor NSC140905, increased the production of aggrecan and collagen type II, and also decreased levels of matrix-degrading enzymes. In OA mice induced by surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus, intraarticular injection of lentiviral vectors carrying mouse Gata4 resulted in a higher OA severity, synovial inflammation, and pain level when compared to control vectors. Mechanistically, we found that overexpressing GATA4 significantly increased the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5. Our work demonstrates that the aging-associated increase of GATA4 in chondrocytes plays a vital role in OA progression, which may also serve as a target to reduce osteoarthritis in the older population.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells, and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV infected and bystander activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses.

Phenology, the temporal orchestration of biological activities, is governed by gene expression, yet the evolutionary dynamics underlying seasonal gene expression remain unclear. To investigate these dynamics, we compared genome-wide expression dynamics (molecular phenology) in four dominant evergreen Fagaceae species in Asia (Quercus glauca, Q. acuta, Lithocarpus edulis, and L. glaber), using leaf and bud tissues over two seasonal cycles. We assembled high-quality reference genomes, identifying 11749 single-copy orthologous genes. Seasonal transcriptomic profiling of these orthologous genes revealed highly conserved gene expression across species in winter when temperatures fall below ~10{degrees}C. Rhythmic gene expression with significant periodic oscillations was more prevalent in buds (51.9%) than in leaves (40.6%), with most rhythmic genes (78.4 - 92.0%) exhibiting annual periodicity, while a smaller fraction (1.2 - 11.9%) followed half-annual cycles. The seasonal peaks of rhythmic genes were highly synchronized across species in winter but diverged during the growing season, reflecting species-specific timing of leaf flushing and flowering. These findings suggest that the four species share a common molecular calendar in winter, which constrains the evolution of gene expression under seasonal environments.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Lastly, we found a significant correlation between rs-FC patterns and ODC maps, supporting the hypothesis that ODC maps can be predicted from rs-FC patterns within V1.

In this study, we used two-photon microscopy to image dendritic calcium transients in deep layer pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. Scn2a+/- mice had diminished coupling between apical and proximal dendritic compartments. Pyramidal tract neurons had abnormal event rates, while intratelencephalic neurons had compartment-specific alterations indicative of diminished dendritic integration.

Apical dendritic tuft in IT neurons typically encoded reward and strategy, but these task-specific representations were altered in Scn2a+/- mice.

However, their patterns of integration, and therefore their likely epigenetic regulation, differ between genera. Beta- and gammaretroviruses are two types of simple retroviruses that have a strong tendency to infect germ cells and endogenize. While ancient endogenous retroviruses are often easy to spot due to mutations rendering them non-functional, more recent integrants can maintain the capacity for full viral production, making it sometimes difficult to discern which integrants are exogenous and likely more clinically relevant. Because endogenous retroviruses generally spend a longer time integrated and subject to host epigenetic regulation as proviral DNA, we hypothesized we could show these integrants exhibit sequence differences from their exogenous counterparts, likely resulting from DNA methylation and histone modifications, and that endogenous retroviruses would generally show habituation to host promoters. Therefore, we have used statistical analyses of publicly available sequence data to demonstrate that endogenous retroviral variants exhibit decreased CpG dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies over time, and that they will show evidence for loss of motifs associated with 'active' histone modifications. Close examination of these patterns provides further clues for distinguishing endogenous and exogenous retroviral variants, potentially aiding in the study of retroviruses in less well-characterized wildlife species.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

In Escherichia coli, replication initiation is thought to be regulated by oscillations in DnaA activity, driven by DnaA-chromosome interactions that differ among leading models. However, direct evidence linking these oscillations to replication initiation has been lacking, and existing models fail to explain the observed decoupling of replication initiation from dnaA expression. Here, we establish a direct link between DnaA activity and replication initiation by demonstrating robust oscillations in DnaA activity, which peak precisely at replication initiation across diverse growth conditions and genetic perturbations. Notably, these oscillations persist even when dnaA transcription remains constant, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that modulates DnaA activity independently of its expression. Additionally, we propose an extrusion model in which DNA-binding proteins sense biomass-DNA imbalance and extrude DnaA from the chromosome to trigger replication, overcoming limitations of existing models. Consistent with this model, perturbation of the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS modulates DnaA activity and replication timing, supporting its mechanistic validity.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

V.; Maier, W.; Rubin, A. F.", "abstract": "Background: Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) assays can systematically assess the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein function. While DMS datasets have been generated for many targets, they often suffer from incomplete variant coverage due to technical constraints, limiting their utility in variant interpretation and downstream analyses. Results: We developed VEFill, a gradient boosting model for imputing missing DMS scores across protein domains. VEFill is trained on the Human Domainome 1 dataset, a large, standardized set of DMS experiments using a uniform stability-based assay, and integrates a broad set of additional biologically informative features including ESM-1v sequence embeddings, evolutionary conservation (EVE scores), amino acid substitution matrices, and physicochemical descriptors. The model achieved robust predictive performance (R squared = 0.64, Pearson r = 0.80). It also demonstrated reliable generalization to unseen proteins in other stability-based datasets, while showing weaker performance on activity-based assays. Per-protein models further confirmed VEFill's effectiveness under limited-data conditions. A reduced two-feature version using only ESM-1v embeddings and mean DMS scores performed comparably to the full model, suggesting a computationally efficient alternative. However, true zero-shot prediction without positional context remains a challenge, particularly for functionally complex proteins. Conclusions: VEFill offers an interpretable, scalable framework for DMS score imputation, especially effective in stability-focused and sparse-data settings. It enables systematic mutation prioritization and may support the design of efficient experimental libraries for variant effect studies.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

The ecological importance of these mutualistic interactions has sparked interest in their long evolutionary history. By examining interaction networks and phylogenetic trees, several studies have suggested that plants codiversify or cospeciate with their associated mycorrhizal fungi. However, recent research has demonstrated that phylogenetic congruence (often interpreted as codiversification) has often been conflated with another pattern called cophylogenetic signal (i.e., closely related plants interacting with closely related fungi), which arises from different biological processes. We performed cophylogenetic analyses on 29 diverse mycorrhizal networks to reevaluate the evidence for codiversification in mycorrhizal symbioses. We found significant cophylogenetic signal but no phylogenetic congruence: closely related plants interact with closely related fungi, but their phylogenies do not match. Instead of codiversification, this finding suggests that plants and fungi undergo diffuse coevolution, likely driven by trait-matching, where compatible, evolutionarily conserved plant and fungal traits govern their interactions. Our work highlights the importance of appropriately interpreting the cophylogenetic methods used to study the macroevolution of plants and their mycorrhizal fungi. It suggests that previous studies proposing codiversification in mycorrhizal symbioses actually detected cophylogenetic signal, indicating that there is no evidence of codiversification or cospeciation occurring during the evolution of mycorrhizal symbioses.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Among these, multi-member gene families of cell surface proteins are of interest because they can act as neuron-specific identification/recognition tags in combinations and contribute to circuit assembly in complex brains through their heterophilic or homophilic interactions. Recently, a multi-protein interactome has been described between the Beat and Side families of IgSF proteins. Here, we use the publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets and newly generated gene trap transgenic driver lines to probe the in vivo spatial expression pattern of the beat/side gene families in odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) and their synaptic target projection neurons (PNs). Our results revealed that each ORN and its synaptic target PN class expresses a class-specific combination of beat/side genes, hierarchically regulated by lineage-specific genetic programs. Though ORNs or PNs from closer lineages tend to possess more similar beat/side profiles, we also found many examples of divergence from this pattern among closely related ORNs and closely related PNs. To explore whether the class-specific combination of beats/sides defines ORN-PN matching specificity, we perturbed presynaptic beat-IIa and postsynaptic side-IV in two ORN-PN partners. However, disruption of Beat-IIa-Side-IV interaction did not produce any significant mistargeting in these two examined glomeruli. Though without affecting general glomerular targeting, knockdown of side in ORNs leads to the reduction of synaptic development. Interestingly, we found conserved expression patterns of beat/side orthologs across ORNs in ants and mosquitoes, indicating the shared regulatory strategies specifying the expression of these duplicated paralogs in insect evolution. Overall, this comprehensive analysis of expression patterns lays a foundation for in-depth functional investigations into how Beat/Side combinatorial expression contributes to the olfactory circuit assembly.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

In this study, we introduce GENERanno, a compact yet powerful genomic foundation model (GFM) specifically optimized for metagenomic annotation. Trained on an extensive dataset comprising 715 billion base pairs (bp) of prokaryotic DNA, GENERanno employs a transformer encoder architecture with 500 million parameters, enabling bidirectional attention over sequences up to 8192 bp at single-nucleotide resolution. This design addresses key limitations of existing methods, including the inability of traditional Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to handle fragmented DNA sequences from multi-species microbial communities, as well as the suboptimal tokenization schemes of existing GFMs that compromise fine-grained analysis. At its core, GENERanno excels in identifying coding regions from fragmented and mixed DNA sequences, a hallmark of metagenomic analysis. It achieves superior accuracy compared to traditional HMM-based methods (e.g., GLIMMER3, GeneMarkS2, Prodigal) and recent LLM-based approaches (e.g., GeneLM), while demonstrating robust generalization ability on archaeal genomes. Leveraging its advanced contextual understanding capability, GENERanno further enables two essential functions: pseudogene prediction and taxonomic classification, both performed based solely on raw sequence data, without reliance on reference databases or comparative genomics. These functionalities collectively streamline the metagenomic analysis pipeline, significantly reducing preprocessing requirements and enabling end-to-end interpretation of sequencing data. Beyond its primary role in metagenomic annotation, GENERanno also serves as a powerful GFM. To evaluate its broader utility, we curated the Prokaryotic Gener Tasks, a comprehensive benchmark suite specifically tailored for prokaryotic genomic analysis. It includes gene fitness prediction, antibiotic resistance identification, gene classification, and taxonomic classification, reflecting diverse aspects of functional genomics. On this benchmark, GENERanno consistently outperforms existing GFMs such as DNABERT-2, NT-v2, and GenomeOcean, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across a wide range of genomic tasks. Overall, GENERanno provides a unified framework that integrates multiple critical functions for metagenomic annotation and beyond. By eliminating dependencies on external resources and offering rich contextual understanding of genomic sequences, this work delivers a foundational tool for advancing functional genomics in complex microbial communities.

These mutations primarily arise from the error-prone activity of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts. This phenomenon aligns with the quasi-species model, in which a cloud of related viral genomes evolves under selective pressures (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and informing future vaccine design. However, conventional RNA sequencing technologies often fail to reliably detect low-frequency variants due to technical errors introduced during sample preparation and sequencing steps. In this study, we implemented a single unique molecular identifier (sUMI) approach to minimize sequencing artifacts and achieve an error rate of approximately 10-. This high-resolution method enabled precise quantification of quasi-species diversity from influenza virus populations isolated at the single-particle level. Comparative analyses revealed mutation frequencies well above background error levels, confirming that the observed variation was of biological origin. Furthermore, application of information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen-Shannon divergence demonstrated that the mutation distribution was non-random, suggesting the presence of selective constraints. Our findings establish a robust framework for studying intra-host viral evolution and provide critical insights that may enhance AI-driven prediction of mutational trajectories and support more effective influenza vaccine strategies.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

A.; Anwar, S.; Mondal, R. K.; Samanta, S. K.", "abstract": "The global surge in antimicrobial resistance is a major public health concern, largely driven by the dissemination of beta-lactamases. Among them, VIM-2 metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) poses a significant therapeutic challenge. In this study, we explore the role of phenylalanine and lysine residues, especially their repeat patterns, in modulating peptide binding affinity and structural interactions with VIM-2. Docking, molecular dynamics simulations, free energy decomposition analysis and residue analysis were conducted on gut metagenome-derived AMPs, PolyF and a control peptide (PolyR). Binding affinity with VIM-2 decreased with declining F content, yet PolyF alone showed unexpectedly low binding. However, PolyF exhibited most negative polar solvation energy in free energy decomposition analysis. This indicates that F repeats play a role in stabilizing a VIM-2-peptide complex in presence of a solvent. PolyF peptide lacks favorable electrostatic or dynamic interactions, likely due to the absence of K residues. Interestingly, loop1 and loop2 analysis of VIM-2 revealed that F repeats interfere with the loops that play a role in functioning of substrate binding at the active site. Additionally, F repeats were found to bind to residues lying adjacent to or nearby active site residues, which points towards the fact that F helps other residues like K to bind more stably with active site residues of VIM-2. Finally, analog designing and analysis reveals that a balance of aromatic (F) and positively charged (K) residues could enhance peptide binding with MBLs like VIM-2 when having hydrophobic on N-terminal and positively charged on C-terminal.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

C.; Grubmueller, H.; Stein, A.", "abstract": "Protein-lipid crosstalk is fundamental to homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, a branch of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, maintains ER membrane properties by degrading lipid metabolic enzymes. However, the ERAD components that sense membrane properties and their mechanisms remain poorly defined. Using reconstituted systems with purified ERAD factors, we show that membrane composition modulates the ubiquitination cascade at multiple levels. The membrane-anchored E2 UBE2J2 acts as a sensor for lipid packing: in loosely packed membranes, UBE2J2 becomes inactive due to membrane association that impedes ubiquitin loading, while tighter packing promotes its active conformation and interaction with E1. UBE2J2 activity directs ubiquitin transfer by the E3 ligases RNF145, MARCHF6, and RNF139, targeting both themselves and the substrate squalene monooxygenase. Additionally, RNF145 senses cholesterol, altering its oligomerization and activity. These findings reveal that ERAD integrates multiple lipid signals, with UBE2J2 relaying and extending the effect of lipid signals through its cooperation with multiple E3 ligases.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

The catalytic efficiency of PLP-dependent enzymes is significantly higher than that of free PLP. The recruitment of PLP from the environment by the enzymes, particularly through interactions outside the active site, is the key step determining the occurrence of PLP-mediated catalysis. However, the precise mechanism by which enzymes recruit PLP remains elusive. Methionine {gamma}-lyase (MGL), a PLP-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the degradation of L-methionine, thereby suppressing cancer cell proliferation through serum or dietary methionine depletion. Here, we report the crystal structure of yMGL, which belongs to a newly identified subgroup of cystathionine {gamma}-lyases, in complex with L-methionine and PLP. Through truncating the C-terminal domain of yMGL both in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrated that this domain, outside the canonical PLP-binding domain, is essential for the specific interaction between yMGL and PLP, as well as for efficient L-methionine catabolism. A conserved Ser in the C-terminal domain, positioned at the active-site entrance of MGLs, confers specificity for PLP. These findings elucidate a previously uncharacterized mechanism of PLP recruitment by MGLs and promote rational design of MGLs with tailored cofactor selectivity and catalytic performance.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

A significant barrier in this field is that existing techniques for monitoring feeding are either prohibitively expensive, limiting their use, or lack the high temporal resolution necessary to align feeding events with neuronal activity. To overcome this, we developed the Crunchometer, a low-cost, open-source acoustic system that uses computational algorithms to create high-resolution feeding ethograms. We validated the system by monitoring feeding across different energy states (hunger/satiety) and by demonstrating that the anti-obesity drug semaglutide suppresses food intake and reduces preference for a high-fat diet. Crucially, the Crunchometer integrates seamlessly with in vivo neural recordings in freely behaving mice. By pairing our system with electrophysiology in the Lateral Hypothalamus (LH), we identified novel \"meal-related\" neurons that track entire meals rather than individual feeding bouts. Using calcium imaging, we further revealed that solid food consumption strongly modulates LH GABAergic neurons, but not glutamatergic neurons. We also found that distinct LH neuronal ensembles encode the consumption of solid food versus liquid sucrose. The Crunchometer is thus a powerful and accessible tool for precisely dissecting the neural correlates of naturalistic feeding behavior. Significance statement: The Crunchometer is a low-cost, open-source technology that democratizes feeding analysis, enabling the precise dissection of appetite neuronal circuits to advance therapies for obesity and eating disorders.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Fluctuations in single-neuron activity in sensory cortex often correlate with perceptual decisions. This kind of correlation has been hypothesized to reflect a causal influence of sensory signals on decisions, a feedback influence of decisions on sensory signals, and various other factors as well. To disentangle these different possibilities, we have examined local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the middle temporal (MT) area of non-human primates performing a motion discrimination task. Compared to single-neuron spiking, LFPs have the advantage of being decomposable into different frequencies that are associated with different anatomical sources of input. More importantly, they persist when spiking activity is inactivated, which precludes a causal influence of the corresponding neural activity on behavior. We found that high frequency (70-150 Hz) LFP power was correlated with perceptual decisions and that this correlation disappeared when spikes were inactivated, consistent with a causal role for this frequency band in decision making. These signals overlapped in time with decision signals in lower gamma-band power (30-50 Hz), which persisted after spiking inactivation, suggesting a non-causal, feedback input. Interestingly, lower-frequency LFP signals (5-30 Hz) reflected both impending perceptual decisions and the outcome of previous trials. Our results therefore reveal that neural activity multiplexes different sources of information about perceptual decisions and that these types of information can be estimated reliably from different LFP frequencies.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

PE11 promotes FLCN-dependent depletion of intracellular lactate to destabilize TFEB and thereby downregulate genes essential for autophagic flux and lysosomal acidification. Using a PE11-deficient Mtb strain, we demonstrate that PE11 targets the FLCN-lactate axis to regulate TFEB stability. Exogenous lactate supplementation restored TFEB stability, enhanced lysosomal acidification, and significantly reduced intracellular bacterial burden. Lactate also synergized with frontline anti-tubercular drugs to improve Mtb clearance.

Plasma samples were processed using nanoparticle technology (Proteograph(R) XT Assay; Seer, Inc), and peptides were analyzed using the Orbitrap Astral (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data-independent acquisition mode. For tissue proteomics, ten aortas were pooled for n = 4 pools per time point and diet, and n = 6 livers per time point and diet. Peptides were analyzed on the Orbitrap Exploris 480 in data-dependent mode. Proteomes were queried against the Tabula Muris mouse single-cell, STRING, and Gene Ontology databases, and queried against a genome-wide association list of 419 risk loci for coronary artery disease.\n\nResultsWe sequenced 5,080 plasma proteins, surpassing previous reports by 10-fold. The prototypical apolipoproteins and complement factors were the most abundant proteins, whereas proteins associated with cytokine/chemokine signaling represented the previously uncharted mouse plasma proteome. We divided the proteome into quartiles (Q1-Q4) to monitor sweeping changes over time. Proteins with a sustained enrichment in HFD (n = 705) were indicative of liver cell subtypes (Tabula Muris). Whereas proteins that moved up from the lower quartiles - Q2 (n = 228), Q3 (115) and Q4 (63) - associated with leukocyte, fibroblasts, and endothelial cell markers, indicating that signatures of inflammation and endothelial activation increase with disease progression. Notably, 86 and 146 proteins were increased at 3 and 6 months, including MMP-12 and COL6A3. Classical apolipoproteins exhibited heterogeneous responses - SAA3 and APOC2 increased, while APOA1, APOE, and LCAT decreased with high-fat feeding, suggesting impaired high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality. Proteins shared between plasma and aorta were enriched for extracellular matrix components, while those overlapping with liver reflected metabolic processes. Finally, 120 coronary artery disease (CAD)-associated proteins from human GWAS were detected in Ldlr-/- plasma, of which 4, including lipoprotein lipase, exhibited an increase in abundance with HFD.\n\nConclusionsNanoparticle-dependent proteome enrichment coupled to mass spectrometry may allow to identify novel plasma biomarkers in Ldlr-/- mice and facilitate monitoring of candidate proteins associated with human disease mechanisms in preclinical interventional studies, thereby opening new avenues for understanding disease pathology and uncovering novel molecular contributors.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

However, this framework has failed to catalyze a step-change in the generation of new chemical matter. Drug discovery continues to depend on costly and largely serendipitous screening campaigns. Our understanding of, and reasoning from, non-bonded interaction chemistry is still too limited. Compounding this is the scarcity of novel chemistry and infinitesimal coverage of the chemical combinatorial space by current experimental data. To alleviate these problems, we show that a machine learning model can successfully learn and infer the principles of non-bonded interactions in the drug-receptor space.

Here, we present a high-throughput, sequence-based model that leverages contextual embeddings from protein language models to predict ice binding potential, as well as the expression and activity potential of candidate proteins. Using a curated data corpus of over 18,000 ice binding proteins -- far larger than previous datasets -- we fine-tuned a ProtBERT-based model, achieving 99% accuracy for prediction of ice binding potential.

The significance of microglia enwrapping motoneurons remains unclear. Within the same motor pools some motoneurons degenerate while others regenerate, and each associate with different microglia phenotypes. Microglia surrounding degenerating motoneurons form tight cell clusters (death clusters) that fully envelop the cell body and express high TREM2 and large CD68 granules, suggesting a macrophagocyte phenotype for motoneuron removal. Microglia surrounding motoneurons undergoing regeneration remain individualized and also upregulate TREM2 and CD68, although to a lower extent, and CD68 granules are smaller. Microglia on regenerating motoneurons extend processes that scan the cell body surface through sweeping motions, likely sampling contents and endocytosing motoneuron-derived material through microphagocytosis. Removal of TREM2, either globally throughout development or specifically in microglia prior to nerve injuries, reduces p-SYK signaling and CD68 expression in all activated microglia, but particularly inside death clusters. There are also pronounce sex differences: CD68 upregulation and downregulation was more significant in females. TREM2 depletion on microglia over regenerating motoneurons prevented the cell body swelling (in both sexes) characteristic of the chromatolytic reaction at the start of regeneration. This correlated with muscle reinnervation delays. We conclude that within the same motor pools, TREM2 facilitates microglia removal of degenerating motoneurons while it facilitates regeneration on other motoneurons. The signals that direct these different microglia phenotypes over degenerating and regenerating motoneurons, as well as the mechanisms that induce degeneration in some motoneurons while most others regenerate, remain to be investigated.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Here we present SABER, a novel approach which utilizes SpRYCas9, a near-PAMless engineered SpCas9 variant, as a molecular biological tool for building deletion libraries with unprecedented speed and ease. We applied this technique to the small and structurally divergent Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) and mapped the set of deletions tolerated for DNA binding activity. We proceeded to use this information to design a set of minimal SaCas9-based effectors capable of CRISPRi transcriptional repression in bacterial cells. Our findings provide new insights into the function of certain structural elements in SaCas9, and we anticipate that our dSaCas9 deletion map may prove useful in further efforts to develop minimal Cas9-based effectors and gene editors.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Herein, we implicate PPE2, a secretory PE/PPE family protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), as a key modulator of adipose tissue physiology that contributes to the development of insulin resistance. In mice, PPE2 caused fat loss, adipocyte hypertrophy, immune cell infiltration, impaired glucose tolerance, reduced expression of PPAR-gamma, C/EBP-alpha, adiponectin and higher insulin resistance. Transcriptomic analysis revealed PPE2 altered expression of genes associated with chemokine/cytokine, ribosomal biogenesis and lipase signaling. PPE2 induced lipolysis by activating cAMP-PKA-HSL axis, increased circulating free fatty acids, a feature also observed in TB patient sera. Interestingly, PPE2-immunization mitigated these effects, suggesting its potential as a subunit vaccine. Overall, this study identifies PPE2 as a key link between Mtb-infection, adipose tissue dysfunction and insulin resistance.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

We have previously found that CT-induced disease leads to increased concentrations of L-lactate in the lumen of the small intestine during experimental cholera. Here, we show that CT-induced disease leads to the upregulation of mammalian lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to L-lactate, in small intestinal epithelial cells. In a suckling mouse model, the bacterial L-lactate dehydrogenase (LldD) conferred a fitness advantage to V. cholerae but not to the {triangleup}ctxAB mutant incapable of producing CT. Finally, the fitness advantage conferred by LldD was significantly reduced in mice lacking epithelial-cell specific LDHA, demonstrating that epithelial-derived L-lactate is a major contributor to CT-dependent pathogen expansion. These findings identify L-lactate as a host-derived metabolite generated by intestinal epithelial cells produced during cholera disease that directly fuels V. cholerae growth during infection, uncovering a mechanism by which CT confers a fitness advantage to the pathogen during disease.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Despite its epidemiological importance, the molecular and microbial determinants of A. darlingi susceptibility to P. vivax remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated vector-parasite-microbiota interactions using experimental infections with field-derived P. vivax gametocytaemic blood, which produced two distinct infection phenotypes: low and high oocyst burdens. Transcriptomic profiling of mosquito midguts across key parasite developmental timepoints revealed that low-infection mosquitoes mounted an early and sustained response characterised by activation of detoxification pathways, redox regulation, aromatic amino acid catabolism, and purine depletion, likely coordinated through neurophysiological cues, which collectively create a metabolically restrictive environment for parasite development. These physiological changes were accompanied by reduced bacterial diversity and enrichment of Enterobacteriales and Pseudomonadales, taxa previously linked to anti-Plasmodium activity. Conversely, high-infection mosquitoes exhibited limited metabolic reprogramming, expansion of Flavobacteriales, and transcriptional signatures consistent with permissive physiological states, potentially associated with reproductive trade-offs. Importantly, low infection outcomes consistently arose from bloodmeals with the lowest gametocyte densities, suggesting that host- and parasite-derived components of the bloodmeal act as early conditioning factors that prime the mosquito midgut for either resistance or susceptibility. These findings reframe A. darlingi vector competence to P. vivax not as a fixed immune trait but as a dynamic outcome of early redox, metabolic, and microbial interactions. They also highlight ecological and physiological targets for transmission-blocking strategies and reinforce the importance of studying vector-parasite interactions in regionally relevant systems.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

In this work, we explore whether physics-based representations of protein variants benefit the performance of VEP models. More specifically, we explore electrostatic representations obtained from solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation as novel features to fit VEP models to deep mutational scanning (DMS) data. We contrast and combine these representations with ones derived from evolutionary models. To this end, we perform a range of experiments; benchmarking, ensembling with evolutionary models, accounting for assay conditions and extrapolating to new screening data.

Building on prior evidence of ICs in the external granule layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum, we investigated their nature in postnatal day 7 (P7) mice. Using immunofluorescence and genetically sparse labeling, we distinguished cytokinetic bridges (CBs), transient connections formed between daughter cells during the final stage of cell division, and intercellular bridges (IBs), more stable connections that persist after division, from TNT-like structures, which form independently of cell division. We observed CBs but not IBs in the EGL. We also observed TNT-like connections throughout the EGL, which appeared to connect both clonally and non-clonally related cells. The presence of these TNT-like structures in the developing EGL suggests that TNT-like connections may contribute to intercellular communication, paving the way for further study of a previously unrecognized mechanism that could influence neuronal fate, migration, and network formation during cerebellar development.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

This is particularly true in settings where SNVs are at low frequency such as cancer detection through liquid biopsy, or human somatic mosaicism. State-of-the-art molecular denoising approaches for DNA sequencing rely on duplex sequencing, where both strands of a single DNA molecule are sequenced to discern true variants from errors arising from single stranded DNA damage. However, such duplex approaches typically require massive over-sequencing to overcome low capture rates of duplex molecules. To address these challenges, we introduce paired plus-minus sequencing (ppmSeq) technology, in which both DNA strands are partitioned and clonally amplified on sequencing beads through emulsion PCR. In this reaction, both strands of a double-stranded DNA molecule contribute to a single sequencing read, allowing for a duplex yield that scales linearly with sequencing coverage across a wide range of inputs (1.8-98 ng). We benchmarked ppmSeq against current duplex sequencing technologies, demonstrating superior duplex recovery with ppmSeq, with a rate of 44%{+/-}5.5% (compared to ~5-11% for leading duplex technologies). Using both genomic as well as cell-free DNA, we established error rates for ppmSeq, which had residual SNV detection error rates as low as 7.98x10-8 for gDNA (using an end-repair protocol with dideoxy nucleotides) and 3.5x10-7{+/-}7.5x10-8 for cell-free DNA. To test the capabilities of ppmSeq for error-corrected whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for clinical application, we assessed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection for disease monitoring in cancer patients. We demonstrated that ppmSeq enables powerful tumor-informed ctDNA detection at concentrations of 10-5 across most cancers, and up to 10-7 in cancers with high mutation burden. We then leveraged genome-wide trinucleotide mutation patterns characteristic of urothelial (APOBEC3-related and platinum exposure-related signatures) and lung (tobacco-exposure-related signatures) cancers to perform tumor-naive ctDNA detection, showing that ppmSeq can identify a disease-specific signal in plasma cell-free DNA without a matched tumor, and that this signal correlates with imaging-based disease metrics.

The model incorporates biologically-inspired rules governing cell behaviors (proliferation, differentiation, death) and key signaling pathways, including Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), translating cell-level behaviors to tissue-level outcomes (in vitro to in vivo extrapolation, IVIVE). Results V-Cornea successfully reproduces corneal epithelial architecture and maintains tissue homeostasis over extended simulated periods. Following simulated trauma or toxicant exposure, the model recapitulates reported healing times of 3-5 days for slight and mild injuries. For moderate injuries with basement membrane disruption, the model demonstrates longer recovery times and emergent dynamic structural disorganization that mimics recurrent corneal erosions, providing mechanistic insights into these pathological conditions. Conclusions V-Cornea's modular CompuCell3D implementation is easily extensible to incorporate additional recovery and injury mechanisms. Future versions will include more realistic basement membrane dynamics and explicit representation of stromal tissue and immune response to improve predictivity for moderate injuries.

Spermatozoa, due to their structural simplicity and well documented quality assessments are often considered the preferred cell type for cryopreservation and ARTs, especially in rare or exotic species. However, inconsistent retrieval of sperm samples with sufficient volume and concentration, especially for critically endangered species, can pose major limitations to assessing overall sperm quality. To address this information gap, we have developed the Wildlife Sperm Index (WSI), a standardized scoring system that integrates key sperm quality metrics, such as motility, viability, and DNA integrity, into a weighted composite score. While this study applies the WSI to sperm, the framework is adaptable to other cell types used in biobanking and reproductive technologies, broadening its potential utility. Unlike traditional sperm assessments that rely solely on microscopy, the WSI provides a scalable and quantitative framework for evaluating samples across species, including those that yield low-volume or concentration sperm samples. We validated the WSI against traditional means of sperm quality assessments, demonstrating its reliability as both a quality assessment and decision-making tool, enabling users to evaluate sample suitability for cryopreservation, ARTs, or downstream applications.

The gradual elongation of the endocardium, driven by convergent extension, organized this adhesion by pulling venous ECs along the anterior-posterior axis. Time-specific manipulation of the heart rate revealed that this endocardial elongation proceeds against heartbeat-driven force. From time-lapse imaging of adherens junctions, which would counterbalance mechanical forces, we found a specific contribution of Cadherin-6 instead of Cadherin-5 in sensing endocardium-specific mechanical force.

Bipolarity occurs as a consequence of cell growth, where the two cell ends have sufficient growth-promoting factors.

To identify how the cell cycle impacts monopolar to bipolar transition, we performed high-throughput mRNA sequencing to detect differentially expressed genes in G1/S-arrested and G2-phase cells of the cell cycle mutant cdc10-129.

Enrichment analysis shows that G1/S phase cells upregulated the MAPK pheromone-response pathway, protein folding, rRNA processing, and heat-shock protein binding. G2 phase cells showed upregulation of plasma membrane maintenance and cell wall organization. Protein-protein interaction networks identified the cdc15-hob3-rho1-bgs1 hub in G2 phase cells. These genes are known to promote bipolar growth and regulate cell wall biogenesis. In G1/S phase cells, spk1-byr2-ste11 hub was identified, which is required for pheromone-response and nutritional stress-dependent G1-arrest. We find that Spk1 also prevents precocious bipolar growth. Thus, we hypothesize that the pheromone response pathway, in addition to promoting G1-G0 transition, also prevents bipolar growth. In nutrient-rich conditions, this pathway is downregulated, G1-arrest is alleviated, the cell cycle progresses, and bipolarity occurs. Our findings suggest that in nutrition-rich conditions, stress response pathways are downregulated, enabling transition from monopolar to bipolar growth, along with cell cycle progression.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

It binds to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and determines the abundance, packaging and stability of the mitochondrial genome. Because its function is tightly associated with mtDNA, TFAM has a protective role in mitochondrial diseases and supportive studies demonstrate reversal of disease phenotypes by TFAM overexpression. In addition, TFAM deficiency has been shown to cause release of mtDNA into the cytosol and activation of the cGAS/STING innate immune response pathway. As such, TFAM presents as a unique target for therapeutic intervention, but limited efforts for activators have been reported. Herein we disclose novel TFAM small molecule modulators with sub-micromolar activity. Our results demonstrate that these compounds result in increase of TFAM protein levels and mtDNA copy number. This results in inhibition of a mtDNA stress-mediated inflammatory response by preventing mtDNA escape into the cytosol. Furthermore, we see beneficial effects in cellular disease models in which boosting TFAM activity has been advanced as a disease modifying strategy including improved energetics in MELAS cybrid cells and a decrease of fibrotic markers in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) fibroblasts. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of using small molecule TFAM activators in indications characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Neurogenic bladder can arise from a variety of diseases including diabetes, spinal cord injuries, and spina bifida. To study the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of the microbiome in neurogenic bladder, we developed a longitudinal cohort of 77 children with spina bifida from two medical centers. We used enhanced urine culture, 16S rRNA sequencing, and whole genome sequencing to characterize the microbial composition of urine and fecal samples. In addition to prospective sample collection, we retrieved prior bacterial isolates from the enrolled patients from the Vanderbilt clinical microbial biobank, MicroVU. This allowed us to compare bacterial isolates from the same patients over a period of five years. Urine samples were characterized by high abundance of urinary pathogens, such as E. coli and Klebsiella. From longitudinal isolates from individual patients, we identified two common patterns of urinary tract colonization. We observed either the rapid cycling of strains and/or species, often following antibiotic treatment, or we observed the persistence of a single strain across timepoints. Neither persistence of a strain nor colonization with a new strain or species was associated with increased antibiotic resistance. Rather, in paired longitudinally collected strains from the same patients, mutations were identified in genes that code for cell envelope components associated with immune or phage evasion. Experimental testing revealed that O-antigen/LPS biosynthesis mutations confer protection from the immune system while altering susceptibility to phage predation, reflecting a fitness trade-off. We argue that this unparalleled cohort offers the opportunity to identify mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to the urinary tract that can be exploited in future therapeutic approaches.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

M.; Steiner, S.; Kelly, J.; Uldry, A.-C.; Dave, P.; Braga-Lagache, S.; Chao, J.; Heller, M.; Thiel, V.", "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells evolved a cellular stress response to cope with extrinsic and intrinsic stress stimuli including virus infections. The major result of this response is the shutdown of bulk translation to prevent damage and allow the reprogramming of translation towards stress-resolving pathways. The resulting translationally stalled mRNA and associated proteins are accumulated in membrane-less cytosolic condensates called stress granules (SG). While the inhibitory effect of translation arrest on virus growth is well established, the role of SGs in the cellular defense against viruses is still unclear. The observation of specific interference with SG formation during various virus infections led to the hypothesis that SGs could serve as antiviral signaling platforms. In this study, we used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) to characterize SGs formed during coronavirus infection. By applying APEX2-mediated proximity labelling in combination with quantitative proteomics, we dissected the proteome of MHV-induced granules and compared it to canonical SGs formed during oxidative stress. Our data revealed substantial differences in protein abundance and composition indicating stressor-specific SG characteristics. To assess if the observed differences are a general feature of virus-induced SGs or rather virus-specific, we extended our investigations to the Semliki Forest virus (SFV), a member of the alphavirus family known to induce SGs. An initial comparison of SG formation kinetics by live-cell imaging showed distinct time points of SG induction between both viruses. A comprehensive comparison of the SG protein compositions revealed profound differences in the SG proteome between SFV and MHV. A further subcellular localization of SG components by microscopy not only confirmed a reduced abundance of several translation initiation factors in MHV-induced granules, but surprisingly, revealed the presence of SFV RNA and the absence of MHV RNA in virus-induce SGs. The reduced connection to canonical SG themes observed for MHV-induced granules compared to SFV- and oxidative stress-induced ones indicates a different impact of these condensates on MHV replication and further raises the question whether they should be considered SGs. The surprising plasticity of SGs concerning induction kinetics, protein composition and abundance, and inclusion or exclusion of viral RNA provide a base for future investigations of the role(s) of SGs in the context of viral infection and how they may impact virus replication.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Because microbial virulence depends on interaction with the host immune system, we investigated how changes in host immune function alter vaccine efficacy. Using a vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin (Hla), which targets host metalloprotease ADAM10 on myeloid cells, we show that Hla virulence is reduced in aged mice due to diminished ADAM10 activity and impaired myeloid cell function. Depletion of myeloid cells with cyclophosphamide in young mice similarly reduced toxin virulence. Immunization against Hla conferred strong protection against Staphylococcus aureus infection in young but not aged mice. These findings indicate that pathogenic functions of microbial factors characterized in immunocompetent young animals may not predict virulence or vaccine efficacy in immunocompromised hosts.

Our study reveals that BCL2 proteins also target Bim for degradation by serving to recruit Bim to the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cul5Wsb2. Wsb2 recognizes Bcl-xl through a motif conserved between Bcl-xl, Bcl-w and Bcl2, but not Mcl1. Disruption of this interaction through mutation of either Bcl-xl or Wsb2 blocks the binding of Wsb2 to the Bcl-xl/Bim dimer. Wsb2 also associates with the Mcl1/Bim dimer through a separate Wsb2 interface, suggesting that Wsb2 has evolved independent means to target Bim. While Wsb2 is not essential in most cells, it is essential in cells derived from tumors of the nervous system, and knockdown of Wsb2 in these lines causes death by apoptosis.

In plants the months-to-years long timeline associated with prototyping putative tissue-specific promoters in transgenic lines deepens this challenge. We have developed a novel strategy called Ribozyme Enabled Tissue Specificity (RETS) that leverages the knowledge of where and when genes are expressed derived from transcriptomic studies to enable tissue specific expression without needing characterized promoters. It uses a split self-splicing ribozyme based on a group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila to enable conditional reconstitution of a transgene mRNA in the presence of a secondary tissue-specific mRNA of choice. We elucidate the design features that enable flexible swapping of transgenes and targets, enhancing transgene expression, and circumventing host RNA interference responses. We then show that these innovations enable tissue-specific and dose-dependent expression of transgenes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of RETS both for creating genetically encoded biosensors to study the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in planta as well as for engineering tissue-specific changes in organ size. RETS provides a novel avenue to study expression patterns of native loci with non-destructive imaging, complementing the weakness of existing approaches.

Gonococci (GC) initiate female infections by colonizing the cervix, which can remain asymptomatic, cause cervicitis, or ascend to the upper female reproductive tract (FRT), leading to severe tissue damage. The FRT undergoes sex hormone-mediated changes during the menstrual cycle, which have long been implicated in the vulnerability to GC infection. One of the major changes is the increase and decrease in the production of the gel-forming mucin MUC5B by the endocervix in response to the level of estradiol (E2). This study examined the impact of sex hormones on GC infection of the human cervix, utilizing a human cervical tissue explant model. Tissue explants were treated without and with E2 alone or in combination with progesterone (E2+P4) to mimic various menstrual cycle phases. Treatment of E2 or E2+P4 enhanced GC colonization at the endocervix exclusively, but did not affect epithelial transmigration. While both treatments increased the number of GC microcolonies, E2+P4 increased GC colony size on the endocervical epithelium. These increases were independent of GC host receptors, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules. GC effectively diffused through cervical mucus to interact with the cervical epithelium under all hormone conditions and through mucin hydrogels with different MUC5B and MUC5AC compositions. Mucus gels collected from cervical explants and animal mucin mixtures enhanced GC aggregation in vitro. GC diffusion through mucin-hydrogels and aggregation in the presence of cervical mucus or animal mucins decreased as the MUC5B concentration increased. Our results suggest that female sex hormones promote GC colonization at the human endocervix by modulating the cervical mucus production, regulating womens susceptibility to GC infection, and further reveal the ability of GC to evade the mucus defense barrier for infection.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

We show that NSs functions as a viral suppressor of RNAi by selectively sequestering single-stranded RNAs derived from 22-nucleotide siRNAs, preventing their incorporation into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC). Complementation with a heterologous RNAi suppressor (p19 protein) partially rescues replication of NSs-deficient virus, validating NSs' RNAi suppressive function. These findings reveal that successful tick-borne viral replication requires host-specific immune evasion strategies and establish NSs-mediated RNAi suppression as essential for SFTSV persistence in arthropod vectors.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Method: high-resolution holographic images of individual colonies on translucent brain-heart agar plates were taken every 30 minutes throughout an 18-hour incubation period (530 MPx for the full plate) using a large field 1x magnification system, a partially coherent LED light source and a high-resolution CMOS sensor. A database containing 49 490 digital holograms of individual colonies from 276 clinical strains belonging to ten of the most prevalent pathogenic bacterial species was used to train the convolutional neural network (CNN). Improvement in the accuracy of the prediction from the CNN algorithms was achieved using the information at different phylogenetic levels. Results: the performance of the BAIO-DX solution was assessed on 232 strains belonging to the 10 species used to train the algorithms but also on 64 strains from 8 species not included in the training database. For the species included in the training dataset, this new method identified 86.6% of the strains at the species level with a positive-percent agreement of 96.5%. An additional 48% of the strains not identified at the species level could be identified at the genus level thanks to the phylogenetic interpretation of the results. Conclusions: these first results validate this approach as a candidate to obtain a fully automated non-destructive and label-free solution for bacterial identification in clinical microbiology laboratories.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

The Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) represents a sophisticated nanomachine used by Gram-negative bacteria for contact-dependent elimination of competitors through the delivery of toxic effectors. While the T6SS has been well-documented in mammalian gut microbiota development, its role in shaping plant rhizosphere communities remains poorly understood despite the ecological importance of rhizosphere microbiota. This study investigates how the three Pseudomonas putida KT2440 T6SS clusters influence the tomato rhizosphere microbiota in agricultural soil. Through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo analyses, we demonstrate that while the K2/K3-T6SSs remain inactive under standard laboratory conditions, they become specifically activated in the presence of plant pathogens, suggesting an adaptive response to competitive pressure. Our experiments with T6SS-deficient mutants reveal that the P. putida T6SSs are essential for effective rhizosphere colonisation, with mutant strains showing significantly reduced colonisation capabilities compared to wildtype strain in competitive soil environments. Most importantly, our data establish that the P. putida T6SSs directly shape the taxonomic diversity and community structure of the rhizosphere microbiota of tomato plants. These results place the T6SS as a critical factor driving the evolution of complex polymicrobial communities within the plant rhizosphere, paralleling its established role in the gut microbiota. This research advances our understanding of the ecological functions of the different T6SSs in P. putida and the molecular mechanisms underlying microbial community assembly in the rhizosphere. Thus, it offers valuable insights for agricultural applications involving beneficial microbes and plant health management strategies.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Current treatments of LN are non-specific, increase risk of infection, and have high rates of relapse. To better understand LN, we obtained 538K single-cell and 143K single-nuclear profiles from kidney biopsies of 156 LN patients and 30 pre-implantation transplant biopsy controls, along with 327K single-cell blood profiles from many of these patients. We built an atlas of kidney tissue cell types in LN encompassing 55 immune and 36 tissue states. Integrating renal immune single cell data with blood data enabled the identification of tissue-specific immune cell states. For example, within the myeloid compartment, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC20) were shared across tissue and blood, while macrophage cell states were tissue-specific (M5-14). We identified LN pathological features associated with cell states. Specifically, we examined the chronicity index, which quantifies irreversible tissue damage, and the activity index, which measures active reversible inflammation. Increasing chronicity index tracked with the most dramatic changes in both tissue and immune cell states. The proportion of injured or degenerating proximal tubule cells expanded with chronicity, reflecting ongoing tissue damage. Increasing chronicity index was also associated with an expansion of tissue-specific CD56bright NK cells (NK1), GPNMBhighNUPR1high Macrophages (M5), and CLEC10Alow cDC2 (DC17). Importantly, most expanded immune populations associated with chronicity index were tissue-specific states. After adjusting for chronicity effects, we identified specific cell states in the myeloid compartment that associated with activity. Highly tissue-specific macrophage populations expressing known Scar Associated Macrophage (SAM) gene signatures were particularly expanded, including M5, GPNMBhigh LYVE1low (M11), C1Qlow SPP1high, SPP1highFABP5high (M7), and MERTKhighFABP5high (M9). We hypothesize that M5 may be a profibrotic pathogenic population that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit. We further demonstrate that blood only partially reflects renal tissue. Our results define key renal cell states in the tissue and immune compartments and argue that profound changes in both compartments are associated with increasing chronicity, while specific changes in the myeloid compartment track with activity. In aggregate, these observations strongly support that therapeutic targeting of myeloid populations, in addition to B cells, may offer an unproved strategy to prevent progression of renal inflammation and ongoing kidney damage in LN.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

However, conventional isothermal amplification methods, especially rapid assays at ambient temperature such as recombinase-aided amplification (RAA), suffer from spontaneous initiation and lack of synchronization across parallel reactions. Here, we report light-activatable RAA systems employing two distinct photocaging strategies to achieve spatiotemporal control. In the first, a photocaged DNA polymerase was engineered via site-specific incorporation of p-azido-L-phenylalanine and conjugation with a 2-nitrobenzyl-modified ssDNA blocker through click chemistry. This approach offers high stability, making it advantageous for long-term storage and lyophilized formats. In the second, 5'-nitrobenzyl-modified primers were synthesized to block hybridization or extension until UV activation, offering operational simplicity and rapid integration into existing workflows. Both strategies independently suppressed background activity in the dark and restored full amplification efficiency upon 365 nm UV exposure. The systems exhibited high sensitivity, low background, and compatibility with portable diagnostics. A custom-built device integrating UV activation and real-time fluorescence detection enabled seamless, on-demand operation. This modular platform provides flexible light-gated amplification solutions, allowing the selection of polymerase- or primer-based caging according to storage stability or workflow requirements, thereby advancing precise and field-ready molecular diagnostics.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

While the elevational niche-breadth hypothesis predicts broader ecological niches at higher elevations due to increased environmental stress and heterogeneity, empirical tests have mostly focused on food specialisation, with habitat specialisation remaining largely overlooked. Here, we provide the first direct test of this hypothesis using habitat characteristics, analysing fruit-feeding butterflies and moths along a complete tropical forest gradient on Mount Cameroon. We quantified habitat-related niche breadth using the Outlying Mean Index across 96 forest plots spanning 350-2200 m a.s.l., employing two complementary metrics: absolute niche breadth (ANB) based on the total range of habitat conditions occupied across the gradient, and within-elevation niche breadth (WENB) reflecting the proportion of local habitat heterogeneity utilized at each elevation. Forest structural heterogeneity increased steeply with elevation. In response, butterfly communities showed a substantial upslope broadening of ANB, particularly in Charaxinae and Satyrinae. Moth families exhibited similar but weaker patterns. In contrast, WENB showed no consistent elevational patterns and was more variable among lepidopteran groups. These results support the elevational niche-breadth hypothesis for habitat specialisation in tropical butterflies, likely reflecting increased habitat opportunity space and reduced competition at higher elevations. However, the decoupling of ANB and WENB highlights that broader availability of environmental conditions does not necessarily translate into more generalised local habitat use, suggesting constraints from behavioural preferences, resource distributions, or biotic interactions. By disentangling overall and local habitat niche breadths, our study reveals unrecognised complexity in elevational specialisation patterns and provides new insights into how tropical insect respond to environmental gradients.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

In hummingbirds, the humerus is critical for power generation and wing control, yet its evolutionary diversification remains poorly understood. We integrate geometric morphometrics, phylogenetic comparative methods, and ecological data to study humeral shape evolution across a diverse sample of 80 hummingbird species. Humeral shape variation was associated with ecological and geographical variables, including body mass, foraging strategy, range size and latitude. Larger body mass or smaller humeri corresponded to more robust, curved shapes, consistent with biomechanical demands of supporting greater forces. In contrast, broader geographic ranges are associated with more slender shapes, possibly reflecting aerodynamic efficiency across variable environments. Humerus shape also changed with foraging strategy: traplining species, which visit flowers along dispersed routes, exhibit elongated humeri favoring efficient, sustained flight, whereas territorial species showed shorter, robust shapes suited to rapid maneuvers. Morphological evolution rates differed among strategies, with trapliners showing highest rates, and increased significantly with range size. Strong phenotypic integration within the humerus indicated that evolutionary changes are tightly coordinated across the bone regions. These findings demonstrate how ecological pressures, scaling effects, and developmental constraints together shape flight-related morphology, underscoring the adaptive flexibility of the avian skeleton.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

This is further complicated since over 60% of 1,548 known genetic variants in G6PD are variants of uncertain significance and thus cannot guide drug prescribing and dosing. To resolve which variants are clinically meaningful and avoid harm from adverse drug reactions, we conducted two high-throughput functional assays: one for G6PD activity, and one for abundance. We measured the function of 10,674 missense, nonsense, and synonymous G6PD variants. The patterns of variant effect on activity and abundance confirmed the importance of structural NADP+ for G6PD activity and abundance, and G6PD dimerization for G6PD activity. Based on the ability of our functional assay scores to accurately classify G6PD variants of known clinical effect, we generated evidence that 4,883 missense variants contribute to G6PD deficiency and 2,768 are unlikely to contribute to G6PD deficiency.

Here, we implement CRISPR-StAR (Stochastic Activation by Recombination), a next-generation inducible CRISPR screening platform for large-scale in vivo applications. The system uses a dual lox-based recombination system to enable guide-level normalization and clonal knockout phenotyping. To analyze the rich (barcode-embedded) sequencing output, we developed UMIBB, a superior Bayesian statistical framework for quantifying gene-level dropout and enrichment compared to conventional software packages. Screening a 30,000-sgRNA library in A549 xenografts, followed by clone representation and dropout correlation analyses, showed high fidelity and reproducibility with dropout phenotypes resolvable using as few as 30 tumors for this size library. Validation across multiple tumor models demonstrated that a single tumor can provide reliable, functional annotation for ~1,000 genes leveraging intra-tumor library controls for normalization. Comparing in vivo and in vitro screens revealed that a substantial subset of tumor suppressor genes exerts strong phenotypic effects only observable in vivo. For example, single-gene knockout and transcriptomic profiling confirmed that KMT2C and KMT2D have contrasting impacts on tumor growth - an insight that would have been overlooked in standard cell culture. Looking ahead, CRISPR-StAR screening, combined with our user-friendly analysis pipeline available on GitHub (R-package), offer an integrated framework for creating in vivo dependency maps that can complement existing vitro datasets like DepMap and Achilles.

Although pauses are largely diffuse over the genome, they are significantly enriched over transcribed features and correlate with transcription and R-loop levels. Transcription-replication conflicts are more numerous when head-on than co-directional.

Objective: To apply CRISPR-Cas9 and homology-directed repair (HDR) as a surrogate strategy to model correction of the pathogenic ADA2 c.506G>A variant in healthy cord blood HSPCs. Methods: HSPCs were electroporated with optimised CRISPR-Cas9 editing reagents, and editing outcomes, including HDR and on-target deletions, were quantified by ddPCR. Cell functionality was assessed through colony-forming unit (CFU) assays and by xenotransplantation into NOD SCID Gamma (NSG) mice. Two HDR enhancement strategies were tested: (1) genetic inhibitors of p53 and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways, and (2) pharmacological NHEJ inhibition. Results: Small-molecule NHEJ inhibitors increased HDR efficiency approximately two-fold (from ~40 % to ~80 %). Edited HSPCs retained normal CFU capacity and successfully engrafted in NSG mice. However, up to 8 % of edited cells exhibited on-target chromosome loss, though this declined over time. Up to 40 % of T cells and fibroblasts demonstrated similar losses under NHEJ inhibitors treatment. In contrast, genetically encoded inhibitors did not improve HDR. Conclusion: The ADA2 p. c.506G>A variant can be effectively edited employing surrogate strategy in HSPCs without impairing functionality. Although pharmacological inhibition of NHEJ enhances HDR efficiency, it also increases the risk of on-target chromosome aberrations, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the associated risks and benefits in therapeutic gene editing.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

The nucDetective pipeline provides specific, high-resolution nucleosome profiles for the different asexual stages of Pf, monitoring the dynamics of individual nucleosomes.

The global mean nucleosome repeat length varies from 176 bp to 185 bp depending on the developmental stage. Stage specific changes in nucleosome positioning occur locally in intergenic regulatory regions, which are characterized by specific histone modifications and variants. Dynamic nucleosomes correlate with DNA accessibility, gene expression and determine the access to transcription factor binding sites in Pf. The highly regular chromatin structure, with stage-specific structural alterations, emphasises the important role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating the complex life cycles of Pf.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

L.; Gervasio, J.; Souders, C.; Deane, C. M.", "abstract": "Developability optimisation is an important step for successful biotherapeutic design. For monoclonal antibodies, developability is relatively well characterised. However, progress for novel biotherapeutics such as nanobodies is more limited. Differences in structural features between antibodies and nanobodies render current antibody computational methods unsuitable for direct application to nanobodies. Following the principles of the Therapeutic Antibody Profiler (TAP), we have built the Therapeutic Nanobody Profiler (TNP), an open-source computational tool for predicting nanobody developability. Tailored specifically for nanobodies, it accounts for their unique properties compared to conventional antibodies for more efficient development of this novel therapeutic format. We calibrate TNP metrics using the 36 currently available clinical-stage nanobody sequences. We also collected experimental developability data for 108 nanobodies and examine how these results are related to the TNP guidelines.

{"title": "Identification of Prospective PETases Across Prokaryotes Using an in silico Approach", "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.14.670228", "authors": "Rathod, Y.; Biswas, S.", "abstract": "Background: Plastics count as one of the most potent threats to the habitats and survival of global flora and fauna. Reports keep accumulating globally about the ever-exploding load of plastic wastes, but the need and economics of multiple industrial and household processes compels the production of more plastic materials. It has always been imperative to look for natural sources of degradation of plastic. The identification of plastic-degrading microbes, therefore remains a major focus of the microbial fraternity. While the discoveries of Ideonella sakaiensis or later, Rhizobacter gummiphilus were more out of providence, the structure determination of the enzyme responsible for PET degradation does provide a fillip to efforts towards identification of more such prokaryotic entities. Results: In this work, a comprehensive profiling of prokaryotic sequences has been undertaken to look for the presence of similar plastic-degradation abilities across the kingdom. The identification of twenty-seven such hits across different bacterial species led us to believe in the natural diversity of plastic-degradation enzymes. Moreover, there seems to be conservation of the structural motif that renders such ability as has been observed from the constructed models and analysis of their interfaces. Docking of BHET, one of the key products of PET, against these 27 entities showed considerable interactions with the above and pointed towards the possible roles of these bacteria as natural plastic degradation models. Eight of these proteins have very close similarity in binding interactions and surface properties to the PETase from I. sakaiensis and were shortlisted as prospective candidates. Conclusions: Of these eight, three PETases from Halopseudomonas pertucinogena Halopseudomonas bauzanensis and Ketobacter sp. revealed significant similarity in structure and conformational stability to the PETase from I. sakaiensis as was evident from the analysis of their molecular dynamics parameters. Principal Component Analysis and the free energy landscape during binding to BHET also validated the hypothesis and these three PETases could be immediately explored for possible plastic degradation activity.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

M.; Lovell, J. T.", "abstract": "While graph-based pangenomes have become a standard and interoperable foundation for comparisons across multiple reference genomes, integrating protein-coding gene annotations across pangenomes in a single 'pangene set' remains challenging, both because of methodological inconsistency and biological presence-absence variation (PAV). Here, we review and experimentally evaluate the root of genome annotation and pangene set inconsistency using two polyploid plant pangenomes: cotton and soybean, which were chosen because of their existing diverse high-quality genomic resources and the known importance of gene presence-absence variation in their respective breeding programs. We first demonstrate that building pangene sets across different genome resources is highly error prone: PAV calculated directly from the genome annotations hosted on public repositories recapitulates structure in annotation methods and not biological sequence differences. Re-annotation of all genomes with a single identical pipeline largely resolves the broadest stroke issues; however, substantial challenges remain, including a surprisingly common case where exactly identical sequences have different gene model structural annotations. Combined, these results clearly show that pangenome gene model annotations must be carefully integrated before any biological inference can be made regarding sequence evolution, gene copy-number, or presence-absence variation.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a large-scale meta-analysis of 3,766 experimentally tested binders across 15 structurally diverse targets. Using a unified, high-throughput pipeline that re-predicts each binder-target complex with AF2 (initial guess and ColabFold), AF3 and Boltz-1, we extract over 200 structural, energetic and confidence features per design. We show that interface-focused metrics, most notably the AF3-derived interaction prediction Score from Aligned Errors (ipSAE) outperform commonly used scores such as ipAE and ipTM, with a significant 1.4-fold increase in average precision compared to ipAE. We further show that combining these metrics with orthogonal physicochemical interface descriptors, including Rosetta {Delta}G/{Delta}SASA and interface shape complementarity, improves predictive performance. While overall performance varies by target, simple linear models trained on a small number of AF3-derived features generalize well across datasets. We propose interpretable, target-agnostic filtering strategies, such as combining AF3 ipSAE_min rankings with structural filters, to improve precision in selecting binders for testing. Finally, we release the complete dataset establishing a community resource to benchmark and accelerate de novo binder discovery.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "Sequence variation across members of an enzyme family contributes to diverse ensemble behaviors, which subtly influence substrate affinity, selectivity and regulation. A classic example is the family of eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs), which regulate numerous cellular processes and serve as important drug targets. Here, we dissect the consequences of sequence variation on the folding-conformational landscapes by performing a meta-analysis of 274 EPKs through a structure-based statistical mechanical framework. We find that EPKs populate several partially structured states in their native ensemble with a hierarchy of structural order in the N-terminal lobe that is critical for catalysis and activation. Despite this, the unfolding mechanism is uniquely conserved across the majority of kinases, with the N-terminal lobe unfolding first. Kinase activation modulates the local stability and thermodynamic connectivity in a non-conserved manner and across the entire structure, due to the strong coupling between the active site residues to distant sites, including the established allosteric pockets. We further show how activation drives the Abl kinase ensemble towards a more folded and thermodynamically coupled system in a graded manner. Our work uncovers the thermodynamic design principles of kinases with insights into allostery, while shedding light on the extents to which ensemble behaviors are impacted by sequence variations in paralogs.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

The Abismo Ponta de Flecha Cave, a vertical cave rich in osteological material, is subdivided into lateral galleries known as Jazidas. Previous paleontological studies have described several extinct and extant species, but chiropterans were only briefly mentioned in the initial study of this cave, with only a single fragmented skull reported. This study presents that skull and briefly discusses the locality where it was found. The specimen belonged to an adult individual of Tonatia bidens, discovered in Jazida 6, an intermediate level located some distance from the cave entrance. Bat osteological remains are fragile and easily destroyed in high-energy environments; therefore, the preservation observed in this Jazida may indicate that the specimen died in situ, without being transported. Although this area experienced intense sediment remobilization in the past, Jazida 6 shows evidence of stability and minimal reworking activity, as indicated by the preservation of fragile specimens, sometimes still in their anatomical position at death.", "date": "2025-08-14", "journal": ""}

We tested the genetic legacy of the Quaternary (GLQ) paradigm in terrestrial protists using Arcellinida testate amoebae diversity distribution across the Iberian Peninsula, a well-established glacial refugium. To do so, we compiled the most extensive Arcellinida metabarcoding dataset to date (ArKOI), including 615 samples from multiple continents and ecosystems. Our results showed that hotspots of intra-OTU genetic diversity align with known Iberian refugia, supporting the concept of refugia within refugia, and displaying clear ecoregion-specific climatic niches. Patterns of spatial clustering, niche breadth, and historical demographic reconstruction revealed repeated range contractions and expansions during the Pleistocene, mirroring those observed in macro-organisms.

Here we provide a detailed spatio-temporal description of photoactivation in the prototypical tetrameric B12 photoreceptor CarH from nanoseconds to seconds by using an integrative approach, combining time- and temperature-resolved structural and spectroscopic methods with quantum chemical calculations. High resolution structural snapshots of key intermediates illustrate how photocleavage of a Co-C bond triggers a pathway of structural changes that propagate throughout CarH from the B12 chromophore, via a previously unknown adduct, to finally cause tetramer dissociation. These unique intermediates, which differentiate CarH from thermally-activated B12 enzymes, steer the photoactivation pathway and act as the molecular bridge between photochemical and photobiological timescales.
