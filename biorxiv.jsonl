Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important regulatory molecules in a number of cell types, but neither the identity nor the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in crMPs are known. Here, we have employed deep RNA-seq and single cell RNA sequencing to resolve the crMP lncRNA landscape from healthy and diseased murine myocardium. CrMPs express previously unknown and highly cell type-specific lncRNAs, among which one lncRNA, termed Schlafenlnc, was particularly abundant and enriched in crMPs. We found Schlafenlnc to be necessary for migration-associated gene expression in macrophages in vitro and in vivo and essential for their adhesion and migration. Collectively, our data provide a basis to the systematic characterization of lncRNAs in crMPs and establish Schlafenlnc as a critical regulator of macrophage migratory functions.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated bHLH-PAS transcription factor, as a key regulator of this stress-growth switch. We show that ligand mediated AhR signaling restrains axon growth, whereas neuronal deletion or pharmacological inhibition of AhR promotes axonal regeneration and functional recovery in both peripheral nerve and spinal cord injury models. Mechanistic studies revealed that axotomy-induced AhR activation in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons enforces proteostasis and stress-response programs to preserve tissue integrity. In contrast, AhR ablation redirects the neuronal response toward elevated de novo translation and pro-growth signaling, enabling axon regeneration. This growth-promoting effect required HIF-1, with shared transcriptional targets enriched for metabolic and regenerative pathways. Single-cell and epigenomic analyses further revealed that the AhR regulon engages the integrated stress response (ISR) and DNA hydroxymethylation to rewire neuronal injury programs. Together, our findings establish AhR as a neuronal brake on axon regeneration, integrating environmental sensing, protein homeostasis, and metabolic signaling to control the balance between stress adaptation and axonal repair.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

J.; Yang, J.-W.; Cai, L.; van der Bourg, A.; Kastli, R.; Karayannis, T.", "abstract": "Just as separated digits and repeated sampling enhance somatosensation in humans, mice sense objects through multiple segregated whiskers through successive contacts. Individual whisker identity is maintained through the somatotopic organization of the Whisker[-&gt;]Brainstem[-&gt;]Thalamus[-&gt;]Cortex axis, culminating in distinct cortical domains: barrels and the surrounding septa. By performing simultaneous recordings using in-vivo electrophysiology in wild-type (WT) mice, we identify a progressive divergence in spiking activity between these domains upon repeated behaviorally relevant (10Hz) single- and multi-whisker stimulation. While the spiking activity ratio of multi- to single-whisker stimulation remains stable in barrels, it increases progressively in septa, suggesting inhibitory cell recruitment. Using genetic fate-mapping and tissue clearing, we indeed reveal that SST+ and VIP+ interneurons exhibit distinct laminar and regional distributions in barrel and septa domains. Further, calcium imaging of SST+ and VIP+ interneurons shows that while both neuron types respond to single-whisker stimulus, SST+ interneurons preferentially engage more in 10Hz multi-whisker stimulation, indicating their critical role in progressive stimulus preference. Genetic removal of Elfn1, which regulates the incoming excitatory synaptic dynamics onto SST+ interneurons, leads to the loss of the progressive increase in septal spiking ratio (MWS/SWS) upon stimulation. The importance of the loss of functional segregation of barrels, versus septa is revealed by cumulative temporal decoding analysis, supporting the notion that SST+ interneuron-mediated inhibition contributes to temporal encoding and stimulus integration. Finally, viral tracing combined with whole brain clearing and imaging reveals that barrel and septa domains project differentially to secondary somatosensory (S2) and motor (M1) cortices. These distinct projection patterns suggest that differential inhibitory processing in barrels and septa may contribute to functionally specialized downstream signaling. Together, our findings indicate that the progressive engagement of SST+ interneurons, mediated by Elfn1-dependent synaptic facilitation, underlies the preferential integration of multi-whisker stimuli in septa. This local inhibitory mechanism likely contributes to the functional segregation of barrel and septa domains and their distinct cortical projections, shaping how sensory information is processed and relayed to higher-order brain regions.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

For studies with a genome sequencing component, current ancestry prediction approaches are hindered by high computational demands and complex input requirements. We present ntRoot, a computationally-lightweight method for inferring human super-population-level ancestry from whole genome assemblies or raw short or long sequencing data. Utilizing an alignment-free variant detection framework, ntRoot employs a succinct Bloom filter data structure to efficiently query diverse genomic data inputs. Demonstrated on over 600 human genome sequencing datasets, including complete genomes, draft assemblies, and over 280 independently-generated datasets, ntRoot accurately predicts geographic labels, a descriptor of human populations, and shows high concordance with traditional methods such as ADMIXTURE (R2 = 0.9567) when predicting ancestry fractions. It achieves these predictions within 30 minutes for complete and draft genomes and within 1 hour and 15 minutes for 30X sequencing data, using a maximum of 13GB and 68GB of RAM, respectively. ntRoot offers both global and local ancestry inference, delivering high-resolution predictions across genomic loci. This paradigm fills a critical gap in cohort studies by enabling rapid, resource-efficient, and accurate ancestry inference at scale, advancing the characterization of continental-level ancestry in the genomic era.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Using stomach content and biomass data, we evaluate food competition between Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and flounder (Platichthys spp.) in the Baltic Sea. We quantify diet overlap and fit geostatistical mixed models to evaluate effects of local-scale covariates on stomach contents. The dietary overlap is low and does not decline with predator density. We find that cod feed less on the isopod Saduria entomon at high flounder densities. However, the total prey weight in cod is not affected by flounder densities. This suggests interspecific food competition is not limiting the overall feeding of cod, but affects its diet composition. In addition, we find support for intraspecific food competition in large cod and flounder.

Although diverse methods have leveraged spectral features to classify patient outcomes, few approaches focus on identifying individual electrodes within the SOZ or integrate a broad spectrum of frequency ranges within a single model. We developed an interpretable machine learning model that integrates power across delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high-gamma frequencies over time to identify the SOZ. For 1,511 electrodes implanted across 21 patients, we computed the mean spectral power in each frequency band for the first 20 seconds after seizure onset and analyzed the differences in power between SOZ and non-SOZ electrodes. In patients who were seizure-free after surgery (n = 14), electrodes within the SOZ showed significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) for mean power over time in the first 20 seconds after seizure onset compared to electrodes outside the SOZ in the alpha (p = 0.0272), beta (p = 0.0263), gamma (p = 0.0013), and high gamma (p = 0.0086) ranges. Additionally, electrodes within the SOZ in patients that became seizure-free after surgery had significantly higher AUC compared to equivalent electrodes in patients who did not become seizure-free after surgery (n = 7) in the gamma (p = 0.0145) and high gamma (p = 0.0024) power ranges. We trained a stacked random forest ensemble model using these features over time to label electrodes within the SOZ. Leave-one-out patient cross validation of the machine learning model yielded a 96.6% positive predictive value and 99.9% specificity for identifying electrodes within the SOZ. Our dataset included a diverse array of seizure onset patterns, which were all classified accurately by the model. A second model was trained to predict post-operative seizure freedom, yielding 95.2% accuracy for predicting seizure outcome based on a planned resection. This two-model design mirrors clinical workflow, first localizing SOZ electrodes to support surgical planning, then predicting outcome based on a surgical plan. An advantage of our interpretable machine learning approach is the ability to interrogate our models to understand how predictions are made. For electrode classification, the model weighed beta (Mean: 0.66, SD: 0.07), high gamma (Mean: 0.54, SD 0.06), and delta (Mean: 0.51, SD 0.06) power bands most heavily.

The temporal and spatial regulation of calcium is crucial for the precise activation of key biological processes. In the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which infects approximately one-third of the global population, calcium signaling governs essential aspects of the parasite infection cycle. T. gondii relies on calcium signals to regulate pathogenic traits, with several calcium-signaling components playing critical roles. Calcium entry from the extracellular environment has been demonstrated in T. gondii for both, extracellular parasites, exposed to high calcium, and intracellular parasites, which acquire calcium from host cells during host calcium signaling events. Active egress, an essential step of the parasite infection cycle, is preceded by a large increase in cytosolic calcium, most likely initiated by release from intracellular stores. However, extracellular calcium is also necessary to reach a cytosolic calcium threshold required for timely egress. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of calcium intracellular store replenishment and identified a central role for the SERCA-Ca-ATPase in maintaining calcium homeostasis not only within the ER but also in other organelles. We demonstrate mitochondrial calcium uptake, which occurs by transfer of calcium from the ER, likely through membrane contact sites. Our findings suggest that the T. gondii ER plays a key role in sequestering and redistributing calcium to intracellular organelles following calcium influx at the PM.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Previous explanations of this stasis rely on evolutionary dynamics peculiar to sex chromosomes, such as the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the sex-specific chromosome or sexually antagonistic mutations on either sex chromosome. Here, I show that stabilizing selection on quantitative traits promotes stability of sex chromosome systems. The reason is that stabilizing selection, while keeping the value of the trait near its optimum, allows individual chromosomes' contributions to the trait to drift, and this chromosome-specific drift reduces the fitness of the novel sexual genotypes necessarily produced during sex chromosome turnover. Given the ubiquity of stabilizing selection on quantitative traits, chromosome-specific drift could play a pivotal role in preventing the turnover of sex chromosome systems across multiple stages of their evolution and can explain key patterns in the phylogenetic distribution of sex-determining systems.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

The duck sector was the most concerned by this crisis but other sectors such as broiler, layer and turkey were also affected by outbreaks. The objective of this work was to assess the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 virus transmission from one farm to another within the French broiler and layer production network. This study used the WOAH risk assessment framework. After drawing up a scenario tree of virus transmission from one farm to another, data were collected through a literature review or through experts elicitation. Three questionnaires were developed according to the experts field of expertise: avian influenza, broiler and layer sectors. The experts estimates were combined using a beta distribution weighted by their confidence level. A Monte Carlo iteration process was used to combine the different probabilities of the scenario tree and to assess the transmission risk. In the broiler sector, the highest transmission probabilities were observed if the exposed farm was an indoor broiler farm and the source a broiler farm (indoor or free-range). The high transmission probability between broiler farms integrated within the same association suggests that integration is an important risk factor. Person movement, transport of feed and manure management were the pathways with the highest transmission probabilities between two integrated indoor broiler farms with good biosecurity levels. In the layer sector, the highest transmission probabilities were observed if the source farm was a free-range farm and the exposed farm a production farm (indoor or free-range). The pathways with the highest transmission probabilities were egg transport and person movement. The sensitivity analysis showed that the exposed farm's biosecurity had a significant impact on the transmission probability. Our results provide an insight on the role of each type of farms in the virus spread within the French broiler and layer production sectors and will be useful for the implementation of control measures such as movement restriction or vaccination.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

The most common mutation found in P. aeruginosa lineages evolved during chronic infections in the human lung, a loss of function of repressor MexZ, increases basal levels of multidrug efflux MexXY, but does not increase resistance by traditional minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. Here, we use single cell microfluidics to show that P. aeruginosa response to aminoglycosides is highly heterogeneous, with only a subpopulation of cells surviving exposure. In contrast, strains carrying mexZ mutations bypass the lengthy process of MexXY activation, increasing survival to sudden drug exposures and conferring a fitness advantage in fluctuating environments. Building on the data we present here, we propose a simple \"Response Dynamics\" assay to quantify the rate of population-level recovery to drug exposures across strains. We used this assay to profile a representative panel of 49 P. aeruginosa strains from diverse environments, showing that the presence of mexZ mutations correlates with faster population recovery from exposures to aminoglycosides, and thus confers an advantage to cells exposed to a sudden, large dose of antibiotic. We propose that the Response Dynamics assay can be used alongside MIC assays for profiling of antibiotic sensitivity to better predict clinical outcomes from in vitro sensitivity/resistance profiles.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Therefore, structural changes, energy transformations, and protein function are intimately related. Despite its central importance, this relationship remains elusive. For example, while many hexameric ATPase motors are known to function using a hand-over-hand alternation of subunits, how energy transduction throughout the assembly structure drives the hand-over-hand mechanism is not known. In this work, we unravel the energetic basis of hand-over-hand in a model AAA+ motor, RuvB. To do so, we develop a general method to compute the residue-scale elastic pseudoenergy due to structure changes and apply it to RuvB structures, recently resolved through cryo-EM. This allows us to quantify how progression through RuvB's mechanochemical cycle translates into residue-scale energy transduction. In particular, we find that DNA binding is associated with overcoming a high energy barrier. This is possible through inter-subunit transmission of energy, and ultimately driven by nucleotide exchange. Furthermore, we show how this structure-inferred energetic quantification can be integrated into a non-equilibrium model of AAA+ assembly dynamics, consistent with single-molecule biophysics measurements. Overall, our work elucidates the energetic basis for the hand-over-hand mechanism in RuvB's cycle.

Compared with traditional bulk RNA-seq data, scRNA-seq data lead to different but comparable co-expression networks among MPGs within metabolic classes, and significantly higher prediction accuracy of MPGs into classes. Prediction accuracy for individual metabolic classes is not associated with the co-expression network tightness, but correlated with the number of MPGs within each class, indicating that including more benchmark genes in the future will improve the MPG prediction. Splitting the RNA-seq data into genetic background/condition or tissue-specific subsets can improve the gene co-expression network tightness and MPG prediction accuracy for some classes; scRNA-seq-based models still outperform bulk RNA-seq-based models for most classes when corresponding subsets are used. In addition, deep learning approaches outperform classical machine learning approaches; approaches implemented in an ensembled workflow AutoGluon tend to have severe overfitting issues potentially due to the relative scarcity of benchmark MPGs within classes.

Despite progress in understanding FMRP functions, the identification of effective therapeutic targets has lagged and at present there are no viable treatment options. Here we identify the 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) as candidate target for intervention in FXS. In the early postnatal hippocampus of Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1KO) mice, an established pre-clinical model of FXS, the 7 nAChR accessory protein Ly6H is abnormally distributed, showing enrichment at the neuronal surface and mislocalization in dendrites. Ly6H, a GPI-anchored protein, binds 7 nAChRs with high affinity and can limit 7 nAChR surface expression and signaling. We find that 7 nAChR-evoked Ca2+ responses are dampened in immature glutamatergic and GABAergic Fmr1KO neurons compared to wild type. Knockdown of endogenous Ly6H in Fmr1KO neurons is sufficient to rescue dampened 7 nAChR Ca2+ responses in vitro, providing evidence of a cell-autonomous role for Ly6H aberrant expression in 7 nAChR hypofunction. In line with intrinsic deficits in 7 nAChR activity in Fmr1KO neurons, in vivo administration of the 7 nAChR-selective positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 improved spatial memory and reduced hyperactivity and seizure severity in adolescent Fmr1KO mice.

Afferents expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) can be selectively activated by transcutaneous photostimuli applied to behaving mice. Despite care taken to precisely target expression of ChR2 to specific cell types, imprecise photostimulation has hindered quantitative optogenetic-based behavioral testing. Here, we used a robot to reproducibly apply transcutaneous optogenetic stimuli to the hind paw of mice while measuring nocifensive withdrawal. Different photostimulus waveforms (pulses and ramps) and response metrics (threshold and latency) were compared in mice expressing ChR2 in all afferents (Advillin-ChR2) or preferentially in nociceptors (NaV1.8-ChR2). CFA-induced inflammation caused withdrawal from ramped photostimuli to become faster relative to baseline and to vehicle-injected controls whereas pulsed photostimuli revealed a modest increase in threshold. Analgesia caused by NaV1.7 and 1.8 channel blockade was evident in both testing protocols. Overall, ramp-based testing was more effective and more efficient (i.e. required less time and total stimulation) than pulse-based testing. Electrophysiology measurements confirmed that inflammation increases nociceptor excitability without affecting phototransduction, and suggests that withdrawal latency depends on the number of nociceptors activated rather than how strongly each nociceptor is activated. Consistent with changes described in nociceptor somata, the behavioral consequences of peripherally blocking different voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels showed that nociceptor axons normally rely on NaV1.8 but upregulate NaV1.7 after inflammation, with important clinical implications for drug efficacy. Collectively, these results demonstrate the utility of optogenetic pain testing when reproducibly delivered and strategically designed photostimuli are used.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

GlyRs are clustered in the post-synaptic membrane by strong interactions of the beta-subunit with the scaffold protein gephyrin. Even though GlyRbeta mRNA is highly expressed throughout the brain, the existence of synaptic GlyRs remains controversial as there is little conclusive evidence using conventional fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiological recordings. Here we exploit the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) to investigate the presence of GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the brain, focusing on several areas of the telencephalon. Making use of a knock-in mouse model expressing endogenous mEos4b-tagged GlyRbeta we identified few GlyRs in sub-regions of the hippocampus. Dual-colour SMLM revealed that these sparse receptors are integrated within the post-synaptic gephyrin domain, pointing to a possible role in maintaining the structural integrity of inhibitory synapses. In contrast, we found functionally relevant numbers of synaptic GlyRs at inhibitory synapses in the ventral striatum. Our results highlight the strength of SMLM to detect few and sparsely distributed synaptic molecules in complex samples and to analyse their organisation with high spatial precision.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Many tools for deconvolution are developed on well-structured tissue architectures such as the 10x Genomics mouse hippocampus dataset. Spatial transcriptomics analysis could offer valuable insights into treatment response, but faces limitations in cellular resolution. Methods: To address this problem, we developed CITEgeist, a computational tool for spatial transcriptomic deconvolution using integrated proteomics data from the same slide. Visium Antibody Capture technology was applied alongside our novel algorithm to analyze the tumor microenvironment. We demonstrate the reliability of our method using pre- and post-treatment samples from six breast cancer cases. Results: Our approach revealed previously undetectable cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment. By taking an interoperable approach to software development and grounding our algorithm in interpretable variables, we demonstrate how CITEgeist deconvolution is not only accurate but robust enough to be directly used as input in external analytical tools developed by other research teams. We then applied this approach to a set of specimens from a prospective trial our group ran and further validated the findings in a series of in vitro experiments as a demonstrated use case of the utility, necessity, and flexibility of CITEgeist; and the potential of our method to rapidly translate novel clinical samples to new biological insights. Conclusions: CITEgeist addresses a critical technical gap in spatial multi-omics analysis through an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach. This work demonstrates the value of combining clinical, translational, and computational expertise to identify novel mechanisms of treatment resistance, potentially transforming therapeutic strategies for resistant disease.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

C.; Glass, M.; Grimsey, N. L.", "abstract": "Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2) is a promising therapeutic target for modulating inflammation. Canonical signalling responses to receptor ligands are critically dependent on cell surface receptor expression. However, it is also now appreciated that intracellular G protein-coupled receptors can contribute to signalling responses and influence functional outcomes. Therefore, understanding how the subcellular distribution of receptors is controlled is also highly pertinent. CB2 is observed to be expressed at the cell surface as well as having a considerable proportion expressed intracellularly. Despite this distribution being well established, little is known about the regulation of CB2 anterograde trafficking and subcellular distribution. We report that sustained treatment with a range of CB2 agonists and inverse agonists stimulates a distinct population of CB2 to be delivered to the cell surface, at various expression levels and despite agonists concurrently internalising cell surface CB2. We present evidence that this ligand-stimulated anterograde trafficking is a result of CB2 agonists, as well as inverse agonists, acting as pharmacological chaperones. We also report that a di-lysine (KK) motif in the CB2 C-terminal tail is required for basal delivery to the cell surface. Corroborating the hypothesis that CB2 ligands can act as pharmacological chaperones, sustained CB2 ligand stimulation induces cell surface expression of the mutated receptor and alters maturation states as measured by western blotting. Our finding that prolonged exposure to CB2 ligands can induce CB2 cell surface delivery via pharmacological chaperoning may well have important implications for optimal design of CB2-targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Genotypes with higher fitness at novel elevations showed lower variance in fitness, lower plasticity across elevations, but higher plasticity within elevations compared to those with higher fitness in the native range.

The PTPN22 alternative allele, 1858C>T, is expressed in 5-15% of the North American population and is strongly associated with the development of autoimmune disease while simultaneously capable of providing protection during virus infection and cancer. In murine models, significant progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that PEP and its pro-autoimmune variant (PEP-R619W) modulate T cell function, yet their influence on non-T cell pathways, such as antigen presenting cell cytokine production, remains less defined. Previously, it was reported that PEP promotes type I interferon (IFN-I) production in dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages following TLR4 stimulus. Here, we show that contrary to previous results, both PEP-WT and the PEP-R619W variant do not promote IFN-I production in DCs and macrophages following exposure to LPS, 3p-hpRNA, or coronavirus MHV A59. We attribute the prior findings to mouse strain-specific differences and conclude that factors independent of PEP may be regulating IFN-I production in these studies. We further show that PEP and its R619W variant distinctly modulate the production of TNF, IL-12 and IL-2 in DCs following LPS stimulus. Taken together, our results challenge the current understanding of the role of PEP during inflammation while providing new insight into how the PEP-R619W variant may alter myeloid cell function during disease.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

A.; Xu, K.", "abstract": "We introduce spatially-encoded dynamics tracking (SpeedyTrack), a strategy to enable direct microsecond wide-field single-molecule tracking/imaging on common microscopy setups. Capitalizing on the native sub-microsecond vertical charge shifting capability of popular electron-multiplying charge-coupled devices (EM-CCDs), SpeedyTrack staggers wide-field single-molecule images along the CCD chip at ~10-row spacings between consecutive timepoints, effectively projecting the time domain to the spatial domain. Wide-field tracking is thus achieved for freely diffusing molecules at down to 50 microsecond temporal resolutions for >30 timepoints, permitting trajectory analysis to quantify diffusion coefficients up to 1,000 um2/s. Concurrent acquisition of single-molecule diffusion trajectories and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) time traces further elucidates conformational dynamics and binding states for diffusing molecules. Moreover, with a temporally patterned vertical shifting scheme, we deconvolve the spatial and temporal information to map long, fast single-molecule trajectories at the super-resolution level, thus resolving the diffusion mode of a fluorescent protein in live cells with nanoscale resolution. While these demonstrated capabilities substantially outperform existing approaches, SpeedyTrack further stands out for its simplicity by directly working off the built-in functionalities of EM-CCDs without the need to modify existing optics or electronics. We thus provide a facile solution to the microsecond tracking/imaging of single molecules and their super-resolution mapping in the wide field.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

J.; McCann, J.; Solovei, K. S.; Palmieri, R. J.; White, M.

The gene anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) has convergently evolved as a sex determination gene in numerous vertebrate species, but how this gene has repeatedly evolved this novel function is not well understood. In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), amh was duplicated onto the Y chromosome (amhy) ~22 million years ago. To determine whether amhy is the primary sex determination gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 and transgenesis to show that amhy is necessary and sufficient for male sex determination, consistent with the function of a primary sex determination gene. We find that amhy contributes to a higher total dosage of amh early in development and likely contributes to differential germ cell proliferation key to sex determination. The creation of sex reversed lines also allowed us to investigate the genetic basis of secondary sex characteristics. Threespine stickleback have striking differences in behavior and morphology between sexes. Here we show one of the classic traits important for reproductive success, blue male nuptial coloration, is controlled by both sex-linked genetic factors as well as hormonal factors independent of sex chromosome genotype. This research establishes stickleback as a model to investigate how amh regulates gonadal development and how this gene repeatedly evolves novel function in sex determination. Analogous to the four core genotypes model in house mice, sex-reversed threespine stickleback offer a new vertebrate model for investigating the separate contributions of gonadal sex and sex chromosomes to sexual dimorphism.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we used multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets acquired at different sites to examine whether a fingerprint can be revealed from FCs of the cervical region of the human spinal cord. Our results demonstrate that the functional organisation of this region also exhibits individual-specific properties, suggesting the potential existence of a spine-print within the same acquisition session. Although the spine-print scores are not directly comparable to those observed in the brain, this discrepancy may in part reflect the intrinsic limitations of imaging this region with fMRI, where where the signals are more susceptible to noise and effective resolution relative to structure size, and tSNR are markedly lower than in the brain.This study provides the first evidence of a spinal cord connectivity fingerprint, underscoring the importance of considering a more comprehensive view of the entire central nervous system.

Emerging evidence suggests the UBR-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (UBR1-7) are involved in the positive regulation of skeletal muscle mass. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of UBR-box E3 ubiquitin ligases under enhanced protein synthesis and skeletal muscle growth conditions. Cohorts of adult male mice were electroporated with constitutively active Akt (Akt-CA) or UBR5 RNAi constructs with a rapamycin diet intervention for 7 and 30 days, respectively. In addition, the UBR-box family was studied during the regrowth phase post nerve crush induced inactivity. Skeletal muscle growth with Akt-CA or regrowth following inactivity increased protein abundance of UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, UBR5 and UBR7. This occurred with corresponding increases in Akt-mTORC1/S6K and MAPK/p90RSK signaling and protein synthesis. The increases in UBR-box E3s, ubiquitination, and proteasomal activity occurred independently of mTORC1 activity and were associated with increases in markers related to autophagy, ER-stress, and protein quality control pathways. Finally, while UBR5 knockdown (KD) evokes atrophy, it occurs together with hyperactivation of mTORC1 and protein synthesis. In UBR5 KD muscles, we identified an increase in protein abundance for UBR2, UBR4 and UBR7, which may highlight a compensatory response to maintain proteome integrity.

Using these tools, we show that CS assemble via a hierarchical pathway initiated by PCM1 scaffold formation followed by regulated client recruitment. PCM1 intrinsically assembles into granules through multimerization, a process modulated by cytoskeleton. High-resolution imaging revealed that PCM1 and its clients occupy distinct subdomains with different compositions and dynamics, adding an additional layer of regulation. Perturbing PCM1 multimerization impaired ciliary signaling, underscoring its functional importance.

We used a repetitive diffuse TBI (rdTBI) model in mice with continuous video-EEG monitoring up to 4.5 months post-injury to investigate electrographic biomarkers before and during post-traumatic seizure development. 25% of mice developed post-traumatic seizures with highly variable latency (5-126 days post-injury). Most significantly, we identified fast ripple-delta DOWN state coupling as an early biomarker that was detectable at 4 days post-TBI and appeared before seizure onset in all seizure-experiencing mice. This EEG signature distinguished seizure-experiencing from seizure-free TBI mice with high specificity. Power spectrum analysis revealed elevated delta and theta power, reduced physiological fast oscillations (alpha, beta, gamma) and increased pathological high-frequency oscillations (fast ripples) in seizure-experiencing animals, indicating network hyperexcitability. Spike analysis showed that while TBI itself increased cortical excitability, seizure onset triggered a dramatic further escalation in interictal activity. These electrographic signatures were remarkably consistent across all seizure-experiencing animals regardless of single or recurrent seizure pattern. Our results demonstrate that fast ripple-delta coupling represents a promising early biomarker detectable at 4 days post-TBI, before seizure onset, offering potential for early identification of post-traumatic seizure susceptibility. Importantly, this biomarker identified all seizure-prone animals regardless of whether they developed single or recurrent seizures, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms and clinical relevance for any post-traumatic seizure occurrence. These findings emphasize the utility of temporal EEG analysis for detecting early electrographic changes in post-traumatic epileptogenesis and may inform future intervention strategies.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

We investigated whether and how system-level computations that transform visual input into perception underlie these heterogeneities. Using the equivalent noise method and perceptual template model, we estimated gain, internal noise, and nonlinearity for orientation discrimination across eccentricity (fovea, parafovea and perifovea) and around polar angle. Participants discriminated the orientation of Gabors embedded in dynamic white noise and showed the expected variations across eccentricity and around polar angle. Importantly, visual performance declined with eccentricity due to decreased gain and nonlinearity and increased internal noise. Observers with stronger eccentricity effects showed greater gain decrease. Only gain varied with polar angle, higher along the horizontal than vertical meridian, and lower than upper vertical meridian, paralleling performance asymmetries. This dissociation aligns with known variations in neuronal count and tuning, suggesting that neural correlations and neural noise contribute to these system-level computations.

High throughput image-acquisition devices now provide biologists with a wealth of data, but mainstream, automated image-classification workflows are still lagging behind, while high-performance classification models remain hardly manageable by most biologists. To fill this gap, we developed PlanktonFlow, an end-to-end, fully automated deep-learning pipeline for plankton imagery intended for biologists having minimal technical expertise with machine learning. PlanktonFlow automates image pre-processing, model training and calculation of performance metrics for four different convolution neural network architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and YOLOv11), as well as inference on novel datasets. We highlight the potentialities of PlanktonFlow by comparing the relative performances of the four models and of the web-service EcoTaxa on classifying images from freshwater samples including 76 classes of both living and non-living objects. EfficientNet-B5 achieved the highest macro-averaged F1 score, outperforming EcoTaxa as well as other models. Despite class imbalance and morphological complexity, all models generalized well across frequent and rare taxa, highlighting the relevancy of the pre-processing routine. Error analyses stressed that classification challenges arose from high intra-class variability and high inter-class similarity. To ease an appropriation and further developments by the community, PlanktonFlow is open source and has a modular structure.

We found that the E3 enhancer is pleiotropic, activating at least four functionally unrelated genes. Despite receiving the same enhancer input each target gene displays distinct and non-overlapping expression patterns. These differences cannot be attributed to context-dependent chromatin looping. Instead, we demonstrate that they arise from the action of each genes promoter-proximal sequence. These sequences act as \"gatekeepers\" that restrict enhancer input into precise tissue- and stage-specific transcription, thus functioning as active interpreters rather than passive recipients of enhancer signals.

Our analyses reveal that agricultural practices are significantly associated with fungal community structure, with effects intensifying from May to July. While conventional practices are associated with increased absolute abundance of commensal and potentially beneficial taxa, higher abundance of several genera which include known pathogens is also observed at organic sites. Alpha diversity declined over time at conventional orchards but remained stable at organic sites.

More extreme environmental conditions near poleward range boundaries often impose reproductive constraints, which may limit fitness and future range expansion. However, few studies evaluate the extent to which adaptive evolution and/or phenotypic plasticity might mitigate the effects of reproductive constraints and contribute to successful range shifts. We examined reproductive trait variation across the geographic range of Acanthinucella spirata, an intertidal snail that has recently expanded poleward along the coast of California, USA. We found that, compared to the range core, A. spirata from cooler range-edge populations allocated approximately 16x more nurse eggs to each developing embryo and had larger offspring at hatching, which may lead to greater juvenile growth rates and survival. Furthermore, range-edge A. spirata populations had lower fecundity, highlighting a potential tradeoff between offspring size and number. Some trait differences between range-core and range-edge populations persisted in an 18-month common-garden experiment, consistent with the hypothesis that such traits may be under selection.

In this study, we developed an in silico protocol that integrates multi-structure covalent docking and machine learning (ML) consensus scoring to improve the prediction of AChE inhibitors. We analyzed 65 ligand-bound (holo) human AChE crystal structures using hierarchical clustering to identify four representative conformations, along with one high-resolution apo structure, for multi-structure docking. A curated library of 412 organophosphate and carbamate inhibitors was then docked covalently and non-covalently into each receptor conformation. The resulting docking scores were evaluated against inhibitors' experimental logIC50 values using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (). Covalent docking outperformed non-covalent docking ( values up to 0.54 vs 0.18), and our ML consensus model trained on the five structures' covalent docking scores achieved the highest predictive accuracy ( = 0.70), surpassing all single-structure and conventional consensus baselines. Chemical cluster analysis revealed structure-activity trends based on ligand flexibility, polarity, and aromaticity. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis highlighted the ML consensus model's ability to flexibly distribute the influence each structure's scores played on its predictions.

Unlike pro-IL-1 {beta}, pro-IL-1 is mainly localised to the nucleus upon expression. This is mediated by a nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) responsible for its importin-dependent transport into the nucleus. This nuclear localisation and the presence of histone acetyl transferase (HAT)-binding domains within the pro-domain suggest a role of this cytokine in gene transcription regulation. In addition, nuclear trafficking of pro-IL-1 is proposed to regulate its secretion. To-date, studies on the nuclear role of pro-IL-1 have used overexpression systems. Here, we generated a mouse where the endogenous Il1a gene was edited with CRISPR to disrupt the NLS (mNLS). Using an in vitro approach with murine macrophages we found that this NLS mutation did not affect pro-IL-1 RNA expression levels in response to LPS but increased its protein expression levels. Moreover, we found that the transcriptional signature induced by LPS was not altered between WT and mNLS macrophages. Release of IL-1 in response to different stimuli such as ionomycin was not negatively impacted by disrupted nuclear localisation, although higher levels of IL-1 release were detected, potentially due to increased levels of pro-IL-1. Inflammatory responses in an in vivo model of peritonitis and an influenza infection model were comparable between WT and mNLS mice. Thus, we have established a mouse model in which pro-IL-1 nuclear localisation is disrupted, although future research is required to reveal the importance of this nuclear localisation for IL-1 function.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

While the physics and functions of LLPS are well studied, its interplay with protein synthesis - translation - remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce a theoretical framework for Co-Translational Condensation (CTC), in which nascent protein chains of polysomes -- multiple ribosomes on one mRNA -- interact with condensates, localizing translation to condensate surfaces. Using coarse-grained simulations, we show that protein domain architecture dictates the thermodynamics of CTC, consistent with a Langmuir adsorption model. Bioinformatic analysis of more than 7,500 proteins reveals that most condensate-associated proteins have architectures favoring CTC, with strong interaction regions of nascent chains exposed on polysomes. At the dynamical level, simulation and reaction-diffusion modeling reveal that CTC is kinetically feasible within typical polysome lifetimes, either through large polysomes nucleating new condensates or via diffusion to pre-existing condensates. As a case study, we demonstrate that CTC enhances post-translational modifications by minimizing unmodified intermediates. More broadly, we anticipate CTC may also influence protein folding, misfolding, and signal-integration latency.

By integrating our data with public primary and matched tumor cohorts, we found that upregulated protein-coding genes in progressed tumors overlapped with those in primary grade 4 tumors and were linked to cell proliferation. In contrast, downregulated genes differed between primary and post-treatment grade 4 tumors. A large fraction of genes that were downregulated only in the post-treatment setting were associated with decreased cell differentiation.

Clinical evaluation with 13 patient urine samples (ten culture-positive, three culture-negative) demonstrated that IL-DEx reliably enabled pathogen detection by qPCR and full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Oxford Nanopore). Performance was comparable to three other extraction methods tested head-to-head, including the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN), the MagaZorb DNA Mini-Prep Kit (Promega), and a phenol-chloroform extraction method. These findings establish IL-DEx as the first ionic liquid-based approach evaluated for DNA recovery from clinical urine samples, providing a fast, simple, and low-cost method suitable for integration into molecular workflows for UTI diagnostics across diverse laboratory and clinical settings.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

However, their application and widespread adoption has been hampered by the labor-intensive and tedious nature of manual analysis of large numbers of images. Quantification of labeled DNA fibers typically depends on subjective examination, selection, and annotation of individual fibers from fluorescence microscopy images reducing inter-user consistency, reproducibility, and experimental throughput. To address these issues, we developed DNAi, a computer vision tool based on deep learning allowing automated detection and quantification of labeled DNA fiber length. DNAi was trained on a large and diverse dataset of manually annotated images of DNA fibers and matches human performance and accuracy in segmentation and length measurement across a wide range of experimental conditions. The open-source tool includes a user-friendly interface, which permits visual validation and manual selection of segmented fibers. Overall, DNAi enables robust, rapid, and reproducible DNA fiber analysis, and is freely available.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Among plant hosts screened, the level of coumarin is correlated with NPV-mediated mortality, with high coumarin levels associated with high mortality and low coumarin levels with low mortality. Flow cytometry and morphological experiments showed that coumarins increased the apoptosis rate in NPV-infected larvae. miRNA transcriptomic analysis of coumarin-exposed larvae identified downregulation of miR-8 and miR-6497-3p, which negatively correlate with expression of pro-apoptotic kinases MAPK and ASK1. In addition, miR-9c-5p is upregulated, suppressing the apoptosis inhibitor 14-3-3 protein zeta. Our study suggests plant coumarins increase the susceptibility of larvae to NPV through miRNA-mediated regulation of apoptotic pathways. These findings suggest viral biocontrol efforts may be more successful on certain host plants, and provide molecular insight into how plant defense chemicals synergize with entomoviruses to control agricultural pests.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Central to lysosomal homeostasis are phosphoinositide lipids, key signaling molecules which establish organelle identity, regulate membrane dynamics and are tightly linked to the pathophysiology and therapy of lysosomal storage disorders, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) interacts with multiple lysosomal membrane proteins and plays a critical role in regulating lysosomal pH by directly inhibiting the chloride/proton antiporter ClC-7, though the molecular mechanism of this inhibition remains unclear. Here, using a combination of functional, structural, and computational analysis, we demonstrate that PI(3,5)P2 binding dramatically remodels the structure of ClC-7 by inducing close association between cytosolic and transmembrane domains. Disease-causing mutations show increased transport activity through loss of PI(3,5)P2 binding and subsequent inhibition. Conversely, ClC-7 activation is correlated with dissociation and increased disorder of the cytoplasmic domain along with novel transmembrane domain conformations, revealing a mechanistic link between specific lysosomal lipids, transporter regulation, and the enigmatic basis of the ClC-7 slow gate.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Mechanisms that govern intrinsic resistance remain poorly understood and likely arise during the premalignant or dysplastic state. Here, we generated a dataset of murine and human oral squamous epithelia spanning the earliest premalignant stages through invasive carcinoma. Integrative analysis of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data across the dysplasia to carcinoma continuum reveals early and sustained shifts in epithelial transcriptomes. Spatially informed cell-cell interaction analysis reveals dysplasia-specific upregulation of wound healing and immune remodeling programs in severe dysplasia and invasive carcinoma in a human sample of oral dysplasia.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective antiviral drugs against NNV, which is crucial for targeted treatment strategies, pathogen control, and loss reduction. Screening of effective antiviral active compounds, namely drug precursors, is key to developing highly efficient drugs against NNV. Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely applied to screen and evaluate various substances to prevent and control virus infection. However, RT-qPCR is a cumbersome procedure and not suitable for high-throughput rapid screening. The aptamer TNA1c, which specifically binds to NNV-infected cells, was used to construct a target-driven activatable aptamer probe (TAA). Then, the TAA probe was applied to establish a high-throughput screening (TAA-HTS) method for efficient evaluation of substances against NNV infection. TAA-HTS technology achieved rapid, sensitive, and specific screening of bioactive substances with significant anti-NNV effects. As compared to commonly used analytical methods, such as RT-qPCR, TAA-HTS has the advantages of easy operation and high sensitivity and specificity.

Tight control of stomatal opening and closing is essential for the uptake of CO2 while mitigating water vapor loss. The opening of stomata is regulated in part by homotypic vacuole fusion, which is mediated by conserved homotypic vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) and vacuolar SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) complexes. HOPS tethers apposing vacuole membranes and promotes the formation of trans-SNARE complexes to mediate fusion. In yeast, HOPS dissociates from the assembled SNARE complex to complete vacuole fusion, but little is known about this process in plants. HOPS-specific subunits VACUOLE PROTEIN SORTING39 (VPS39) and VPS41 are required for homotypic plant vacuole fusion, and a computational model predicted that post-translational modifications of HOPS may be needed for plant stomatal vacuole fusion. Here, we characterized a viable T-DNA insertion allele of VPS39 which demonstrated a critical role of VPS39 in stomatal vacuole fusion. We found that VPS39 has increased levels of phosphorylation when stomata are closed versus open, and that VPS39 function in stomata and embryonic development requires dynamic changes in phosphorylation. Our data are consistent with VPS39 phosphorylation altering vacuole dynamics in response to environmental cues, similar to well-established phosphorylation cascades that regulate ion transport during stomatal opening.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Processes that govern species-specific aspects of human postnatal brain development are difficult to study in animal models. While human brain organoids offer a promising in vitro model, they have thus far been shown to largely mimic early stages of brain development. Here, we developed human brain organoids for an unprecedented 5 years in culture, optimizing growth conditions able to extend excitatory neuron viability beyond previously-known limits. Using module scores of maturation-associated genes derived from a time course of endogenous human brain maturation, we show that brain organoids transcriptionally age with cell type-specificity through these many years in culture. Whole-genome methylation profiling reveals that the predicted epigenomic age of organoids sampled between 3 months and 5 years correlates precisely with time spent in vitro, and parallels epigenomic aging in vivo. Notably, we show that in chimeric organoids generated by mixing neural progenitors derived from 'old' organoids with progenitors from 'young' organoids, old progenitors rapidly produce late neuronal fates, skipping the production of earlier neuronal progeny that are instead produced by their young counterparts in the same co-cultures. The data indicate that human brain organoids can mature and record the passage of time over many years in culture. Progenitors that age in organoids retain a memory of the time spent in culture reflected in their ability to execute age-appropriate, late developmental programs.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Critically, simple vividness ratings can replace the protracted questionnaires commonly used for this purpose and reduce methodological issues with these instruments. We further find that vividness is closely linked with the experience of \"seeing\" mental images or projecting them into the external world. People who report seeing mental images with their eyes shut are also more likely to experience externally projected imagery.

This research could ultimately guide medication selection, yet links between network dynamics and medication effects on cognitive function require further validation. Here, we examined whether dynamic activity of an attentional network at rest relates to task-evoked brain activation on the Multi Source Interference Task (MSIT) following administration of methylphenidate (20mg) and haloperidol (2mg), which have opposing effects on attention and catecholaminergic function. Fifty-nine healthy adults completed resting-state and task-based fMRI on three separate days on which they received methylphenidate, haloperidol, or placebo in a double-blind placebo-controlled design. Coactivation pattern analysis determined time spent in the dorsal attention network (DAN) under placebo at rest. Linear mixed-effects modelling assessing the relationship between MSIT task activation under drug and time spent in DAN at rest under placebo and MSIT task activation under drug identified a significant interaction in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; p<0.001). Post-hoc analyses indicated that more time in the DAN at rest under placebo was associated with decreased MSIT dlPFC activation under methylphenidate and increased dlPFC activation under haloperidol. Findings demonstrate that resting dynamics of an attentional network are linked to task-related brain responses under different drug conditions within a region implicated in attentional control and sensitive to catecholaminergic variance. Resting-state dynamics may predict pharmacological modulation of goal-directed cognition, highlighting the potential clinical utility of resting-state dynamics in predicting medication response and supporting individualized treatment.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Characterization of STAU2 knockout iPSC derived cells using scRNA-seq shows that loss of STAU2 disrupts neuroepithelial cell identity and accelerates neural differentiation by altering the activity of key transcription factors and driving early metabolic transitions. Additionally, STAU2 regulates the expression of miRNA host genes and alters miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional control in progenitor cells, which exerts additional effects on STAU2 regulated gene regulatory networks. These changes result in neural progenitor exhaustion, unstructured neural rosettes, and reduced organoid size.

The defect in trafficking localized to the sorting endosome where the complex sphingolipids failed to enter recycling tubules serving the PM. Sphingolipid trafficking was rescued by over-expression of Cav1, but not by a Cav1 mutant that lacked the S-palmitoylation sites.

We find that a wave of ecological invasion is unaffected by the bottleneck, whereas a cultural wave can be blocked by sufficiently narrow corridors. The maximum bottleneck width that prevents propagation depends on the domain shape, and it converges to the threshold value when the habitat to be invaded gets larger. Our results align with mathematical results on a bistable reaction diffusion equation, particularly mean curvature flow, based on which we provide an approximate formula of the threshold bottleneck width.

Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach to generate mutant lines of transient protein expression host Nicotiana benthamiana presenting a compact, space-efficient phenotype compared to the so-called LAB strain commonly used for protein production. Our strategy consisted of altering apical dominance by suppressing the biosynthesis of strigolactone, a negative regulator of axillary bud outgrowth-promoting cytokinins. Strigolactone-depleted lines were generated by knocking-down the expression of either Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 (CCD7) or Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 (CCD8), two key enzymes of the metabolic pathway leading to strigolactone synthesis. Knocking-down the genes of either enzyme had no impact on the overall growth rate of the plant but drastically influenced its leaf proteome, auxin/cytokinin ratio and overall architecture. More specifically, the {Delta}CCD mutants exhibited altered glycolytic and malate-processing enzyme fluxes driving the production of pyruvate and cytokinins in leaf tissue, an axillary growth-oriented development pattern and, most importantly, a spatial footprint reduced by 45% to 50% compared to the LAB strain. Most importantly, recombinant protein yields per plant were maintained in the mutant lines, as here illustrated for the model protein GFP and for rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody of confirmed clinical value in humans.

We discovered that the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like SYMRK phosphorylates EPP1 on a conserved serine residue and that this phosphorylation is essential for symbiosis.

These microbiota contribute to plant performance and health, in part by providing a microbial barrier against invading plant pathogens. To colonize plant hosts, pathogens not only have to overcome host immune responses, but also breach the microbial barrier, for which they secrete so-called effector proteins. Accordingly, the soil-borne fungal plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae secretes the antimicrobial effector Ave1 to suppress antagonistic microbes and facilitate host colonization. Notably, many pathogens, including V. dahliae, have life stages outside their host plants, for instance in soil, where they encounter diverse microbial communities. Yet, how antimicrobial effectors support establishment across these environments remains poorly understood. To address this, we established a collection of natural soil samples with diverse physicochemical properties and microbiota compositions. Using this collection, we show for three plant species, barley, tomato and cotton, that root-associated bacterial and fungal communities are primarily shaped by the type of soil, whereas the phyllosphere microbiota is mainly determined by plant species. On tomato, we furthermore show that Ave1 differentially contributes to virulence on diverse soils, as Ave1 altered the tomato microbiota on all soils tested, but the taxa affected by these shifts varied depending on the specific soils. Our findings suggest that while Ave1-mediated microbiota manipulation occurs across soils, its impact on fungal virulence is influenced by the specific composition of the soil-derived microbiota assembled by the host.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we compared physiological and molecular responses of poplars colonized by Paxillus involutus (Pi) or Cenococcum geophilum (Cg) under control conditions, drought stress, and recovery. Both fungal species primed distinct local (root) and systemic (leaf) defenses compared to non-inoculated (Ni) plants. Cg-colonized poplars exhibited constitutively elevated transcripts of heat shock proteins (HSPs), galactinol synthase, and aquaporins in roots and leaves, irrespective of drought. Pi colonization enhanced growth and nitrogen-use-efficiency along with transcriptional increases of TOR/RAPTOR complex. Under severe soil moisture decline, Pi and Ni poplars showed reduced water potential, photosynthesis, growth, and leaf shedding, whereas Cg-colonized plants maintained water status, sustained photosynthesis, and retained foliage. These results reveal two contrasting mycorrhiza-mediated drought strategies in poplar: Pi fosters stress acclimation via drought-induced leaf abscission, enabling rapid recovery; Cg suppresses growth even without stress, conferring constitutive tolerance. Ectomycorrhizal species thus occupy different positions on the growth-defense trade-off spectrum. Such species-specific effects have important ecological and applied implications, enabling targeted use of EM fungi in forestry and agriculture depending on whether maximizing productivity or enhancing stress resilience is the primary goal.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Hence the use of genetically derived resistance to supplement other pest control strategies is warranted. In soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), a major determinant for resistance is the quantitative trait locus, QTL-M. Glyma07g14530, the gene underlying QTL-M, encodes a feeding-inducible flavonol 3-O-glycosyltransferase (F3GlcT or UGT78D2) that glucosylates kaempferol, as well as quercetin, myricetin, and isorhamnetin. The resistant allele has a premature stop codon in it, thus preventing the glucosylation and sequestration of flavonols in the vacuole, leading to a concomitant accumulation of proanthocyanidins and manifestation of resistance. Expressing the dominant (susceptible) allele in resistant plants restores susceptibility and silencing the susceptible allele results in resistance. The discovery and characterization of GmF3GlcT helps clarify the role of flavonoids in resistance to leaf-chewing insects and facilitates the development of insect-resistant cultivars that ultimately can lower production costs and reduce insecticide applications.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

To find additional sources of resistance, Genome-Wide Association (GWA) was used to analyze 337 soft winter wheat genotypes from Indiana, USA, by inoculating seedlings with two isolates of Z. tritici in a complete randomized design. Necrosis and pycnidia development were assessed at 14, 18 and 22 days post inoculation, enabling the calculation of area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) for each parameter. Adjusted necrosis and pycnidia AUDPC scores were compared with 14,341 high-quality SNPs in a GWA analysis using the FarmCPU and GAPIT CMLM models to identify markers associated with the resistance. Significant (p < 0.05) isolate times genotype interactions were identified, confirming that the phenotypic variation was caused by isolate-specific resistance genes. Overall, 9 marker-trait associations (MTAs) were identified with Z. tritici necrosis and pycnidia resistance. All mapped MTAs were isolate and necrosis/pycnidia specific. Distinct MTAs were mapped for necrosis and pycnidia on chromosome 6A, and for pycnidia on chromosomes 1A, 1D, 4A, 7A, 3B and 5B. The MTAs on chromosomes 4A, 6A, 5B and 1D likely corresponded with the known genes Stb7, Stb15, Stb1 and Stb19, respectively. Those on chromosomes 1A, 7A and 3B were not associated with previously known genes and may be novel. Candidate genes near the marker locations have been identified for further investigations.

However, it is not clear what role this circuit or dopaminergic modulation play during rhythm production and synchronization tasks. Here, we propose that the basal ganglia may specify, maintain, and adapt the tempo with which rhythmic action (e.g. finger tapping or walking) is performed. We build a model based on previous \"action selection\" models of the cortico-basal-ganglia loop, altered such that cortico-basal-ganglia loops correspond not to distinct actions but to a continuum of possible action tempi. During rhythm production, an initial tempo is selected by cortical input, and rhythmic action can be automatized to continue in the absence of cortical input if tonic dopamine levels in striatum are sufficiently high. When striatal dopamine is reduced, our model reproduces two key features of dopamine deprivation in Parkinsons disease: freezing of gait, and increased variation in produced intertap intervals during rhythmic tapping. By reanalyzing data from a recent experiment with Parkinsonian patients, we confirm the models prediction that increased interval variability should be largely attributable to increased tempo drift (rather than, e.g., increased timekeeper noise). This model of rhythm production is the first to invoke specific features of basal ganglia circuitry. It augments existing models of action selection in basal ganglia with the addition of continuous action parameters, and in doing so provides a starting point for further modeling of action timing and rhythm in the motor system. It offers a new model of the mechanism by which rhythmic auditory stimulation supports gait in Parkinsons patients, and makes a new, testable prediction about sensorimotor synchronization under conditions of low tonic dopamine.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

While network science has developed various metrics to assess the degree of connectivity between these regions, it has not yet considered the level of activity within each region. Consequently, a highly connected region might be classified as a hub in the brain's connectome, even if it is weakly active or linked primarily to less active areas. Conversely, a region that is highly active but has only a few connections may be undervalued. To address this issue, we present a fully-weighted brain graph in which both edges (representing connectivity) and nodes (indicating metabolic activity) contribute to the importance, or centrality, of each region. In this model, the metabolism-weighted centrality (MwC) of each brain region integrates both connectivity and metabolic activity, using three datasets from simultaneously acquired functional MRI and metabolic FDG-PET data. We found that our fully-weighted brain graph demonstrates a greater ability to explain quantitative imaging data of signaling metabolism and its association with cognitive domains than a classical, edge-weighted graph. Additionally, regions with relatively high MwC exhibited increased synaptic and metabolic activity, as indicated by transcriptomic data. Furthermore, these regions showed higher susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders. This framework of a fully-weighted brain graph represents a paradigm shift from connectivity-based metrics to an activity-aware brain graph. It offers a more biologically informed representation of brain network dynamics, connecting metabolic activity levels to higher cognitive functions as well as neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

In mammalian viruses, splicing is a well-established mechanism for proteome expansion, yet in plant viruses it is considered extremely rare and remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigated splicing in the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV; Begomovirus coheni), a member of the largest genus of the Geminiviridae family in which splicing events have not previously been described. Analysis of RNA sequencing data from TYLCV-infected plants revealed eight splicing events in viral transcripts arising from both genome strands, most of which harbour canonical splice sites and are predicted to generate novel protein isoforms. Two events, affecting the Rep and CP transcripts, were experimentally validated, confirmed to occur specifically at the RNA level, and shown to depend on the plant spliceosome. Spliced transcripts associate with high-order polysomes, indicating that they are actively translated. Silencing of the spliceosome component SF3B1 reduced viral splicing and limited TYLCV accumulation, indicating a requirement for splicing in full infectivity. Supporting this notion, plants infected with a TYLCV mutant impaired in one of the identified splicing events displayed diminished viral accumulation and attenuated symptoms, demonstrating that viral splicing contributes directly to pathogenicity. Collectively, our results reveal that splicing of viral transcripts is pervasive in TYLCV and promotes infection, suggesting that transcriptome complexity in plant viruses has been substantially underestimated.

We previously identified a presynaptic self-amplifying mechanism of glutamate overflow, where NMDA overstimulation activates JNK2-mediated phosphorylation of STX1A. To block this mechanism, a cell-permeable peptide, called JGRi1, was previously developed to disrupt the JNK2-STX1A interaction. Here, we investigated whether inhibition of this pathway by JGRi1 could provide neuroprotection in retinal degeneration. Here we showed that JGRi1 efficiently reached the mouse retina upon topical administration as eye drops and granted retinal protection. Using an ex vivo optic nerve cut (evONC) model, we demonstrated that JGRi1 preserved RGC viability, reduced phosphorylation of JNK and STX1A, and lowered glutamate release. In retinal wholemounts, JGRi1 similarly preserved RGC survival. Furthermore, in an NMDA-induced degeneration model, JGRi1 protected RGCs, reduced glutamate levels, disrupted the JNK2-STX1A interaction, and limited microglial infiltration.

The precise activation and repression of defense-related genes are crucial to balancing the trade-off between growth and immunity. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) play a well-established role in the local regulation of plant-microbe interactions. While some miRNAs are also essential for systemic defense responses, their mechanisms of action, biogenesis, and long-distance mobility remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that HASTY (HST), a key factor in miRNA biogenesis and intercellular movement, is required for systemic defense activation. The impaired mobility of miRNAs in hst mutants correlates with a lack of systemic responses. In infected tissues, HST may enhance the co-transcriptional processing of specific pri-miRNAs, which promotes the cell-to-cell movement of their mature miRNAs and contributes to the activation of systemic defenses. Furthermore, two miRNAs that exhibit increased mobility during systemic defense induction are required for a proper systemic response. Interestingly, complementing hst mutants with a version of HST expressed exclusively in companion cells is sufficient to restore systemic defense induction, highlighting the role of miRNA cell-to-cell movement. These findings shed light on the role of HST in plant immunity, linking miRNA biogenesis and mobility to the fine-tuned regulation of systemic defenses.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Objectives: This study aimed to identify and compare rhythmic genes and pathways in photoprotected and chronically photoexposed human skin in vivo. Methods: Twenty healthy White women, aged 51-63, with moderate-severe photoageing of the dorsal forearm were recruited. Skin biopsies (3mm) were taken from photoprotected (upper buttock) and photoexposed (dorsal forearm) skin of each individual at noon, 6PM, midnight, and 6AM, across a 24-hour cycle. Skin biopsies were analysed by RNA sequencing. Cosinor analysis identified cycling genes along with their amplitudes and peak expression phases. Nested models were used to identify genes that were differentially rhythmic between the photoprotected and photoexposed sites. Phase set and gene set analyses identified pathways enriched among rhythmic transcripts or altered between the two sites. Results: In the photoprotected buttock skin, 1546 genes (12%) met the criteria for cycling. In photoexposed forearm skin, the number was reduced to 959 (8%). As a group, transcripts that cycled in both sites had overall higher amplitude in photoprotected skin (p < 2.2e-16). Peak expression times for these transcripts showed a pronounced bimodal distribution and were clustered in the early morning and mid-afternoon. Distributions of peak times were significantly different between photoexposed and photoprotected skin (p < 0.00025), with peak times advanced in photoexposed skin. We identified 480 genes with significantly different rhythmic properties between the skin sites. Genes involved in DNA repair, MYC targets, E2F and G2M checkpoint pathways were enriched among those that showed higher amplitude oscillations in photoprotected skin. Genes involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition and apical junction pathways showed higher amplitude oscillations in photoexposed skin. Conclusions: Temporal rhythms have a marked influence on skin molecular physiology and are altered in photoaged skin. Temporally advanced cycling patterns and a reduced number of rhythmic genes in photoexposed as compared to photoprotected skin suggest that chronic UV exposure may disrupt and/or reprogram circadian output rhythms to further alter skin physiology.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Nutrient deprivation, one of the most frequently encountered stresses in nature, causes haploid budding yeast to enter a reversible state of non-proliferation known as quiescence, which entails extensive remodeling of gene expression, metabolism and the cellular biophysical properties. Yeast cells can adapt to and survive long periods of time in glucose starvation-induced quiescence, provided they are able to respire in the early stages of glucose withdrawal. When respiration is blocked during glucose withdrawal, cells prematurely age and exhibit markedly reduced survival and cytoplasmic diffusion. We find here that respiration is required to induce a quiescence-related gene expression program. Induction of this program prior to withdrawing glucose in respiration-inhibited cells bypasses the need for respiration and rescues survival and biophysical properties to levels seen in glucose-starved but respiration-competent cells. This rescue effect relies on proteomic adaptation, which partially occurs through inactivation of Ras/PKA signaling and activation of the environmental stress response via the transcription factors Msn2/4. This signaling cascade triggers the expression of stress response genes and modulates the cytoplasmic diffusion state of cells, ensuring long-term survival in quiescence even in the absence of respiration. Our results highlight the importance of stress adaptation in quiescence and aging, integrating gene expression control and modulation of cytoplasmic properties to maintain cell fitness.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Lipotransferase 1 (LIPT1) catalyzes the covalent attachment of lipoic acid to mitochondrial 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases, sustaining flux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Loss of LIPT1 causes accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which is known to inhibit -ketoglutarate (-KG)-dependent histone demethylases and promotes heterochromatin formation. Here, we show that 2-HG-driven heterochromatin impedes replication fork progression, causing fork stalling and RS in LIPT1-deficient cancer cells. To bypass stalled forks, PrimPol-mediated repriming resumes DNA synthesis but leaves behind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which requires poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) for repair. Furthermore, nascent DNA at reprimed forks undergoes MRE11-dependent degradation, further destabilizing replication fork integrity.

This is surprising, since salt concentration increases dramatically as the water in the drop evaporates, making the drop a harsh environment for virions. A plausible hypothesis to explain the slow decay of viral infectivity is that the main solution components (mainly virions, salt and protein) segregate during the evaporation, with virions being transported away from salt deposits, protecting them from the salt's damaging effects. Understanding where virions reside in a drop residue is essential to disentangle the physico-chemical mechanisms that drive their inactivation. However, determining the virion location in an environment as heterogeneous and complex as a sessile drop is experimentally challenging. Here we use electron microscopy in the drop dry remains to show that virions are found mainly forming aggregates in protein-rich regions of the residue, away from salt crystals. Previous works have also attempted to detect the presence of virions in drop residues, with inconclusive results due to experimental limitations. Additionally, neither the physical mechanism behind the observed viral distributions were properly described in previous works. In this work, we complement our experimental observations with a theoretical description of the flow inside the drop, which allows to elucidate the transport mechanisms yielding the observed viral spatial distribution. The theoretical transport model, supported by experiments, allows us to rationalize the spatial distribution of salt, protein, and virions inside evaporating respiratory drops. We anticipate our results to be an essential ingredient to explain the discrepancies between the infectivity decay rates measured in respiratory drops, which nowadays exhibit important discrepancies.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Here we present an accurate and efficient approach to phylogenetic inference. Our approach, called NeuralNJ, employs an end-to-end framework that directly constructs phylogenetic trees from the input taxa, thus effectively avoiding the inaccuracy incurred by the split inference stages. The key innovation of NeuralNJ lies in its learnable neighbor joining mechanism, which iteratively joins neighbors guided by learned priority scores and thereby achieves accurate tree reconstruction. The inference accuracy is further enhanced through incorporating reinforcement learning-based tree search. Using both simulated and empirical data as representatives, we demonstrate that NeuralNJ can effectively infer phylogenetic tree with improved computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy.

Manual labeling and proofreading remain a major bottleneck for accurate extraction of microstructures. While computational models have advanced automated segmentation, they typically require training from scratch on each dataset, demanding substantial annotated data. Domain adaptation methods address this by transferring knowledge from a labeled source to a less-annotated tar get. However, existing approaches are limited to adaptation from a single source domain. This overlooks the potential benefits of integrating information from multiple diverse domains, motivating the development of multi domain adaptation. To address this, we propose MACS, the first known multi domain adaptation framework that combines knowledge from multiple heterogeneous source domains to learn segmentation in the target domain, and employs active learning to efficiently select the most informative target samples for annotation. MACS uses information-theoretic weighting to com bine source domains, and introduces a novel and efficient Bayesian Laplace approximation for uncertainty estimation. Our extensive experiments across nine connectomics datasets demonstrate that MACS consistently and sub stantially outperforms state-of-the art models, even under limited annotation budgets, with a mean improvement of 5.89% at the lowest annotation bud get and 27.72% at the highest annotation budget.

Two different frameworks have been proposed to quantify the resource costs of traits, focusing on either energy allocation or ribosome allocation. These frameworks implicitly assume energy provisioning or protein production limits growth, respectively, but the connection between the two limitations has been underexplored. To better connect these frameworks, we reformulate previous models and incorporate the degradation, recycling, and energetic demands for cell maintenance to quantify the cost of traits, depending on the nature of the resources diverted, genetic background, and the environmental conditions experienced. Notably, our model predicts that increasing food quality increases the cost of traits that require the production of new structures, while decreasing the cost of traits requiring energy expenditure. Understanding how environmental change affects the cost of traits has important implications for the evolution of various traits, including antimicrobial resistance.

In goats, multiple miRNAs are involved in coordinating the expression of networks of genes with key roles on the phenotypic variation of milk and meat traits. Although a comprehensive set of goat miRNAs has been annotated, their levels of polymorphism have not been characterized yet. Such information would be relevant in order to explore the effects of miRNA variants on phenotypes of economic interest in goats. Results By using whole-genome sequencing data from 770 domestic goats with African, Asian, and European origins, we have identified polymorphic sites located within miRNA genes as well as in their flanking regions. In doing so, we have found that miRNA polymorphisms are rare (median alternative allele frequency of 0.46%) and that the distribution of polymorphic sites within and around miRNA loci is uneven. Remarkably, the stem, loop and neighbouring regulatory regions of precursor miRNA hairpins show a significantly higher polymorphism density compared to the miRNA seed, which determines the binding affinity to target mRNAs. Moreover, we have detected a differential segregation of miRNA variants across and within continental regions, with an enriched segregation of putatively high impact polymorphisms, i.e. those located in the seed and other biologically relevant regions of miRNA genes, in isolated goat populations with a low census and elevated content of runs of homozygosity. Conclusion Goat miRNA genes display low levels of variation particularly in the seed region, likely due to the action of strong purifying selection removing mutations with potential effects on gene regulatory networks linked to miRNA function. Moreover, miRNA polymorphisms tend to be more abundant in goat breeds with high levels of homozygosity, likely because purifying selection is less efficient in populations of limited size. The information provided in the current work could be useful to identify miRNA polymorphisms contributing to phenotypic variation through the disruption of gene regulatory networks in domestic goats, as well as to assess their potential impact on adaptation and fitness.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Here, by applying pair-wise bottom-up proteomics in pAT of humans and mice, we found pAT presents a browning signature, as demonstrated by enrichment of mitochondria, presence of UCP1, and greater metabolic capacity compared to subcutaneous AT. In mice fed a high-fat diet or obese patients, the pAT undergoes whitening, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, reduced mitochondrial content, respiratory capacity, and UCP1 levels. Lipectomy of pAT from obese mice decreased pathological ventricular hypertrophy. Conversely, selective beta3-adrenergic agonist treatment rescued pAT browning status and is associated with improved heart structure and function, including ventricular thickness, and fibrosis in obese mice.

Herein, we examined the effects of overexpressing or knocking out NAMPT in adipocytes on metabolic dysfunction and interorgan communication in mice. We generated new adipocyte-specific NAMPT overexpressing(ANOV) mice model. Male ANOV mice are protected from diet-induced metabolic dysfunction including adipose tissue inflammation, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. In contrast female ANOV mice were less protected from metabolic dysfunction, possibly due to higher endogenous expression of NAMPT in WT female mice. Livers of ANOV mice showed improved insulin signaling, increased NAD content, and reduced steatosis, suggesting that NAMPT regulates interorgan communication between adipocytes and hepatocytes. Extracellular vesicles (EV) isolated from ANOV mice enhanced insulin signaling in HepG2 cells and improved glucose tolerance in WT obese mice.

Using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq in Aldh1l1-EGFP/Rpl10a mice, expressing an EGFP tag on astrocyte ribosomes, we identified hundreds of differentially translated astrocytic genes following chronic continuous two-bottle choice ethanol drinking.

Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) was previously shown to regulate MDSC differentiation. In this study, we aimed to generate immunosuppressive MDSCs from mouse bone marrow (BM) through genetic modification combined with cytokine treatments, and to investigate the ability of these ex vivo induced BM-MDSCs to suppress inflammatory responses in the CIA mouse model of RA. We found that myeloid specific ablation of SHIP1 increased the ratio of MDSCs and enhanced their regulatory functions in cytokine induced BM culture.

Adoptive transfer of either BM-MDSCs significantly reduced disease incidence and severity, but SHIP1 deficient BM-MDSCs exhibited even higher efficacy compared to wild-type BM-MDSCs. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of SHIP1 enhanced the expression of immune regulatory genes in BM-derived MDSCs, and adoptive transfer of these cells protected against CIA development.

Human mothers worldwide frequently experience sleep restriction and fragmentation, a pattern also observed in other mammalian mothers, such as rats. These alterations may add to sleep disturbances unrelated to motherhood. Considering this, we wondered about the impact of sleep restriction in postpartum mother rats on their immunological status. Furthermore, given that early-life experiences can shape the immune system and that even subtle parental changes can influence offspring development, we hypothesized that maternal sleep loss might also exert detrimental effects on the pups. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute and chronic maternal sleep restriction during the postpartum period on immune parameters in both mother rats and their offspring by analyzing antibody titers and systemic inflammation. Methods: mother rats were surgically implanted with electrodes for polysomnographic recordings and for sleep deprivation (deep electrodes targeting the mesopontine wake-promoting area). From postpartum day 5 to day 9, lactating dams were randomly assigned to one of three groups: chronic sleep restriction (CSR; 6 h of sleep deprivation per day for five consecutive days), acute sleep restriction (ASR; 6 h of sleep deprivation only on postpartum day 9), or control (undisturbed). On postpartum day 9, mothers were milked, and blood samples from both mothers and pups were subsequently collected. ELISA assays quantified IL-17A, IL-6, IgG, and IgG2a in maternal serum; IgG and IgG2a in milk; and IgG in pup serum. Hematological parameters, including leukocyte profiles, were also assessed in peripheral blood of dams and pups. Results: maternal immune parameters analyzed remained unaffected by sleep restriction. IgG levels were lower in male pups from mothers subjected to ASR (5560 {+/-} 734 {micro} g/mL) compared with the control group (8666 {+/-} 463 {micro} g/mL; p = 0.025), whereas female pups showed no significant changes.

Conclusions: Chronic and acute maternal sleep restriction had distinct impacts on offspring immunity, altering serum antibody and leukocyte profiles, while leaving maternal parameters unaffected.

Yet, their consumption, especially in aquatic systems, is difficult to detect and rarely characterized. Here, we combine molecular techniques with acoustic telemetry, literature review, and extensive natural history observations to investigate the food web consequences of synchronized reproduction in freshwater fishes. First, we demonstrate that a common but underappreciated fish species, white sucker, creates a resource pulse used ubiquitously by consumers, from local invertebrates and fishes to mobile predatory fishes, birds, and terrestrial mammals. Spawning white sucker create trophic hotspots that attract consumers across trophic levels and ecosystems to feed on eggs, spawning adults, and aggregated egg predators. Then we show that egg provisioning and predation is widespread among north-temperate freshwater fish species, highlighting that resource pulses instigated by mass reproduction may play a critical but underappreciated role in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

We compared endogenous chemokine ligands (CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL7, CXCL8) at the highly homologous CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors using biosensor assays to measure Gi activation, {beta}-arrestin1/2 recruitment, GRK2/3/5/6 translocation, and receptor internalization. Our data reveal qualitatively different signaling patterns, most notably where CXCL1 acts as a G protein-biased partial agonist at CXCR1 but as a balanced full agonist at CXCR2. These signaling differences correlate with receptor internalization but not subcellular ERK activation patterns measured using compartment-specific biosensors. Collectively, our findings demonstrate receptor bias in CKR signaling, transducer activation, and compartmentalized kinase activation in translating chemokine identity into discrete functional outcomes.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

To simulate the growth and metabolism of S. scrofa muscle stem cells under different lactate and ammonium concentrations, this study constructed the first proteome constrained metabolic model for the core metabolism of S. scrofa muscle stem cells, pcPigGEM2025. The relationship of lactate and ammonium levels with cellular metabolism was derived from growth and metabolomics data of two culture conditions with low and high initial ammonium concentrations, and then incorporated into metabolic flux simulation. Metabolic flux simulations for experimental conditions, along with perturbation simulations considering stressed non-growth associated maintenance and oxygen supply, demonstrated that pcPigGEM2025 could effectively characterize the response of the S. scrofa muscle stem cell's growth and metabolism to varying environmental conditions, shedding light on model-aided control and optimization of the cultured meat production process.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Such Spatially Varying Correlations (SVCs) are critical for understanding biological processes such as gene regulatory mechanisms shaped by local tissue environments, yet existing tools remain limited for this task. To address this gap, we present spCorr, a flexible and scalable regression framework for studying SVCs. spCorr provides interpretable, spot-level estimates of gene correlation and detects gene pairs whose correlations vary across locations or between tissue domains.

Despite recent therapeutic advances, rising incidence rates emphasize the urgent need for identification of new targets and therapies. Roles of interleukin receptor-associated kinases IRAK1/4 are emerging in hematologic and solid malignancies. In AML, IRAK4 mRNA is overexpressed at diagnosis, relapse, in residual disease, and in FLT3-ITD-mutant cells, MDS, MPN, and MDS/MPN-negative subtypes. Compared with hematopoietic stem cells, IRAK4 is elevated in t(15;17), inv(16)/t(16;16), and t(11q23)/MLL subtypes, correlating with poor survival. Here, we disclose anti-AML activity of PSP-0119, a novel IRAK4 PROTAC degrader. PSP-0119, inhibited IRAK4 kinase activity, NFkB; activity, and IL1B induced IRAK4 phosphorylation. In-silico docking revealed interactions in CRBN/IRAK4/PSP-0119 ternary complex.

However, neural activity accounts for only a portion of the observed BOLD signal fluctuations, as the vasculature integrates multiple physiological inputs that contribute to the response. Research focusing on isolating the vascular components of the BOLD signal revealed that markers of cerebrovascular health, such as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), serve as valuable biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. This study examines the relationship between vascular metrics and noise in a cohort comprising individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HC). Vascular responses were assessed using three functional contrasts during a hypercapnic challenge: arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) reactivity, vascular space occupancy (VASO) to quantify cerebral blood volume (CBV) reactivity, and BOLD imaging. Noise metrics were derived from multi-echo BOLD resting-state data by isolating the TE-independent components of the signal. Mean correlation coefficients for noise vs ASL-CVR are: (-0.12 {+/-} 0.06) for HC, (-0.14 {+/-} 0.08) for MCI, (-0.11 {+/-} 0.05) for AD. Mean correlation coefficients for noise vs BOLD-CVR are: (0.25 {+/-} 0.11) for HC, (0.24 {+/-} 0.07) for MCI, (0.23 {+/-} 0.11) for AD.

These results suggest that TE-independent noise relates to the three vascular contrasts to varying extents and directions, with no significant differences across groups. Further analysis within specific functional networks revealed group differences in certain networks. The observed cortical correlations between noise and vascular features provide important insights into brain function and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, offering a potential avenue to disentangle vascular and neural contributions in brain network and connectivity studies.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

We recruited 359 low-trusting individuals who participated in a trust game under strict anonymity conditions. Results show that OT administration significantly increased trusting behavior by roughly 15%, with consistent effects across regression models with and without controls for personality traits. A pooled data analysis incorporating a previous sample (n=219) of low-trusting individuals further strengthens this conclusion, yielding a statistically significant 16.9% increase in trust. Crucially, no interaction effect was found between OT and the degree of dispositional trust, suggesting OTs effect is uniform across the low-trusting spectrum. These findings present a strong case for OTs selective trust-enhancing role.

We then use this metric to rapidly explore sequence space as large as >3x10^47 variants using principles of the germinal center, deriving new high-affinity CIS43 variants from the method. We further extend this framework to generate high-affinity variants of an unrelated PfCSP-targeting antibody, L9, by maturing both homotypic and antigen-binding interactions, which demonstrates substantial flexibility of the approach.

N.", "abstract": "The light-responsive outer segment of rod photoreceptors is composed of two distinct membrane subdomains: discs and the plasma membrane that surrounds them. To understand how proteins are delivered to these subdomains, we focused on the plasma membrane-specific cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel. It was previously reported that the {beta}1 subunit of the CNG channel is absent from rods in peripherin-2 knockout (Rds-/-) mice. It is unclear how the disc-resident protein peripherin-2 would impact the localization of CNG{beta}1 in the plasma membrane. In this study, we investigate how peripherin-2 is engaged in CNG channel delivery to the outer segment. We overexpressed a MYC-tagged CNG{beta}1 in Rds-/- rods and found that it is trapped in intracellular membranes. CNG{beta}1 localization was restored to the outer segment when full-length, FLAG-tagged peripherin-2 was expressed. This led us to investigate the region of peripherin-2 that is required for CNG{beta}1 delivery by expressing peripherin-2 chimeras containing either the N-terminus, tetraspanin core, or C-terminus. We show that the peripherin-2 tetraspanin domain is sufficient to localize CNG{beta}1 to the outer segment. Recent studies have shown that peripherin-2 and ROM1 act redundantly in outer segment disc formation and enclosure. Consistent with this, we found that expression of ROM1 chimeras containing its tetraspanin region could also restore CNG{beta}1 localization. We postulated that the structural properties of these tetraspanin proteins could facilitate CNG channel delivery to the outer segment. Interestingly, this notion is supported by endogenous staining of CNG{beta}1, which reappears in aged Rds-/- rods that have produced ciliary membrane protrusions.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

We identify IL-10R signaling, an established negative feedback regulator in mature myeloid cells, as critical for returning HSCs to quiescence. IL-10R blockade prolongs HSC cycling and sustains activated transcriptional programs after acute inflammation. With chronic exposure, blockade increases cumulative divisions and accelerates aging hallmarks, including myeloid bias, loss of polarity, and functional defects, under conditions that do not otherwise exhaust HSCs when IL-10R signaling is intact. Jak2V617F mutant HSCs resist the aging acceleration induced by blockade. Consistent with this resistance, IL-10R blocking antibody promotes Jak2V617F clonal expansion and augments the myeloproliferative neoplasm phenotype.

To clarify the ancestral function of Notch, we turned to an early branching Metazoan--the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi--and conducted structural analyses of putative Notch components to evaluate predicted signaling potential. We characterized gene expression of these components with in situ hybridization and show they are expressed during late embryogenesis. Using hybridization chain reaction (HCRTM), we examine MlNotch expression relative to canonical transcriptional targets and putative stem cell markers and identify differential expression patterns at a cellular resolution.

However, environmental perturbations can be subtle, and the associated biological effects could be masked by experimental noise and bioinformatic processing, especially when the samples are generated separately. Multiplexing strategies have been developed to label each sample and process them together to reduce experimental noise, but existing multiplexing methods often fall short for non-human and non-mouse models in established single-cell RNA sequencing protocols like the BD Rhapsody technology. To address this gap, we combined Lipid Modified Oligonucleotide (LMO) cell tagging with the BD Rhapsody platform to achieve efficient and scalable multiplexing of early embryonic chick cells under different environmental conditions. This species-agnostic LMO approach overcomes limitations of antibody-based multiplexing methods that are often restricted to human and mouse systems, and the only multiplexing option available with the BD Rhapsody system. In our study, we successfully compartmentalized and multiplexed chick embryonic cells under different treatment conditions, analyzing up to 40,000 viable cells per experiment. This strategy minimized experimental noise, eliminating the need for bioinformatics-based batch correction. As a result, we were able to achieve high-quality transcriptomic profiling with minimal loss of critical biological information and identified subtle biological differences that were masked when using data integration pipelines.

Extra-pair males rarely contribute resources outside of sperm, therefore, many hypotheses surrounding the fitness benefits of extra-pair (EP) paternity involve genetic mechanisms.

We tested this hypothesis by quantifying extra-pair paternity in nonmigratory, food-caching mountain chickadees (Poecile gambeli). Chickadees rely on spatial cognition to recover scattered food caches and variation in spatial cognition is associated with increased survival, longer lifespan, and is heritable, however, less is known about the relationship between reproductive success and spatial cognition. In the current study, we had two main objectives; to assess the relationship between spatial cognition and reproductive output via extra-pair young and to compare the spatial cognition of EP males to the within pair males they cuckolded. We found that 1. males with better spatial cognitive abilities have more extra-pair young and produce heavier offspring in their own nests compared to their poorer performing counterparts, and 2. EP males have significantly better spatial cognition than the social males they cuckolded.

While many enzymes catalyze reactions with a single substrate, others, like DNA polymerase, can act on multiple related substrates. Substrate-selective inhibitors (SSIs) target these multi-substrate enzymes to modulate their specificity. Although SSIs hold promise as therapeutics, our theoretical understanding of how different inhibitors influence enzyme specificity remains limited. In this study, we examine enzyme selectivity within kinetic networks corresponding to known inhibition mechanisms. We demonstrate that competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors do not affect substrate specificity, regardless of rate constants. In contrast, noncompetitive and mixed inhibition can alter specificity and can lead to non-monotonic responses to the inhibitor. We show that mixed and non-competitive inhibitors achieve substrate-selective inhibition by altering the effective free-energy barriers of product formation pathways that are enabled by the inhibitor's presence. We then apply this framework to the Sirtuin-family deacylase SIRT2, showing that the suicide inhibitor thiomyristoyl lysine (TM) cannot influence substrate specificity unless there is a direct substrate exchange reaction or biochemical constraints are relaxed.

Multiple evidence supports that the membrane recruitment of Httex1 is critical for its self-assembly and related toxicity in HD. In this work, we quantitatively examined the early steps of monomeric Httex1(23Q) association with lipid membranes and its impact on the conformational dynamics of the adjacent polyQ regions - the N-terminal N17 segment and C-terminal proline-rich region (PRR). A broad range of membrane physical properties was explored, including zwitterionic and anionic lipids, and also co-existing liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. Two single cysteine mutants were engineered at the N- and C-termini of Httex1(23Q) and fluorescently-labeled with acrylodan or Atto 488 to probe their local polarity and flexibility, respectively. Our results indicate that Httex1-23Q preferentially binds to negatively-charged lipid vesicles, and to a lower extent to liquid ordered/disordered phases. The N-terminal N17 segment inserts deeply into anionic membranes, adopting a less flexible state than in aqueous solution. At variance, the C-terminal PRR remains highly dynamic and solvent exposed in the Httex1-23Q membrane-bound state, preserving its intrinsic disordered features across all lipid compositions used. Altogether, our work provides unique insight into the distinct roles of each flanking polyQ region in mediating httex1-lipid binding, and how the lipid composition further modulates these early interaction steps.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

One contributing factor to their low immunogenicity is impaired antigen presentation, which allows tumor cells to escape from cytotoxic T cells. Here we use a syngeneic mouse model of medulloblastoma to study the role of CD8+ T cells in medulloblastoma growth. We demonstrate that despite low expression of MHC Class I on tumor cells, depletion of CD8+ T cells accelerates tumor growth, whereas adoptive transfer of tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells prolongs survival. These anti-tumor effects rely on T cells secreting interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}), which induces MHC class I on tumor cells and facilitates tumor cell killing by T cells. Notably, this response is essential for CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor attack, as blocking IFN{gamma} signaling in vivo abrogates MHC class I induction and eliminates the beneficial effect of T cells. Importantly, delivering IFN{gamma} directly into tumors via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) enhances CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of tumor cells and significantly prolongs survival in tumor-bearing mice. These studies highlight the importance of T cells in controlling brain tumor growth and the value of IFN{gamma} as an adjuvant for T cell-based immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

While the latter topic has been explored with respect to several of its simple reflex behaviors, this study represents the first examination of how one of Aplysia's more complex behaviors, escape locomotion, is affected in animals nearing the end of their natural lifespan. Old animals (12-13mo) showed a greatly reduced gallop response compared with middle-aged adults (5-7mo), together with a loss of locomotion onset latency sensitization. Large-scale VSD imaging was used to record motor programs in isolated brain preparations from middle-aged vs. elderly animals. Old brains displayed the same loss of onset latency sensitization seen in the intact old animal behavior, and also a reduced number of cycles per locomotion episode. Brains from middle-aged animals showed an unchanged number of motor program cycles from that observed in intact animals, but a much more transient motor program onset latency sensitization. A further age-related finding was that while in middle-aged brains repeatedly eliciting the motor program led to progressively increasing cumulative activity across trials, in old brains this same procedure led to progressively decreasing activity. Some of our results are consistent with peripheral processes working in concert with the CNS as animals age to support healthy locomotion behavior and its modification by learning, or with early changes in the brain that are not yet expressed in behavior.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

More generally, changes in the neural population representing accumulated evidence may result from a switch in the set of neurons representing the relevant behavioral output or a switch in the set of neurons receiving task-relevant information. Here, we present a model that achieves this flexible transfer of graded information without changing synaptic connectivity. Graded signals are widely broadcast throughout the population, with a dynamic gating mechanism controlling which neurons are receptive to this information. This mechanism supports a continuous decision process across changing frames of reference, offering a potentially general framework for cognitive continuity in dynamic environments.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether the effects of sleep moderate the effects of depression and anxiety on cognitive performance. We were particularly interested in cognitive tasks designed to tax pattern separation, which we hypothesize are most sensitive to the cognitive impairments caused by mental health symptoms and sleep disturbances. Methods: We recruited young adults (N=89; aged 18-30 years) and remotely monitored their sleep for 7 consecutive days using wrist actigraphy and daily sleep diaries. On day 7, participants completed in-person cognitive testing and mental health questionnaires. Cognitive tests included the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), and the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). The CANTAB Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS) and the MST, are designed to tax pattern separation. Mental health questionnaires included Becks Depression Inventory (BDI) and Becks Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Results: Eighty participants (mean age: 20.13, SD: 2.00) were included in the final analyses. Depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with performance on the PVT and CANTAB DMS. Bedtime and wake-up times were significantly correlated with performance on DMS and MST.

This emerges not only from the self-assembly of lipids and proteins but also from active forces originating in the underlying cytoskeletal cortex. These forces drive membrane molecules into non-equilibrium steady state patterns such as nanoclusters. However, the molecular agents connecting membrane organization with cytoskeletal dynamics and stresses have remained unknown. Here we show that two classes of ubiquitous ancestral non-muscle myosins are deployed for the organization of different types of membrane components. Inner-leaflet localized Class I myosins link outer-leaflet GPI-anchored molecules to juxta-membrane actin-filaments, whereas the more cortically-localized Class II myosins operate on transmembrane proteins endowed with actin-binding capacity. Consistent with an active Flory Huggins theory for phase separation, these observations show that the distinct motor-driven membrane molecules generate spatially segregated mesoscale domains, enriched in nanoclusters derived from different myosin classes. Moreover, chemically reversible post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation enable concatenation of these domains by enhancing affinity of the membrane domain constituents for each other. We anticipate that the segregation potential of the ATP-fueled cell membrane is made available for the crucial purpose of modulating information transduction because it can be regulated in space and time during the construction of signaling cascades, underpinning functional plasma membrane organization.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Yet, the mechanisms by which lipid imbalances are sensed and corrected to establish and maintain homeostasis are, in most cases, unknown. Here we present an expanded view of plasma membrane (PM) phosphoinositide metabolism by revealing an unexpected metabolic connection between two key anionic lipids in this membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidic acid (PA). PM pools of PI4P are generated by PI 4-kinase Type III (PI4KIII/PI4KA), an essential enzyme whose partial dysfunction leads to numerous hereditary human diseases. We find that depletion of PI4P by pharmacological inhibition of PI4KA increases the activity of phospholipase Ds (PLDs) and the levels of their lipid product, PA, in the PM. Guided by RNA-seq analysis and proximity labeling proteomics, we elucidate how cells connect this PI4P decrease to a compensatory increase in PA levels. Loss of PM PI4P induces a concomitant decrease of phosphatidylserine (PS) levels, and this metabolic rewiring activates a reciprocal relationship between PS synthesis and PLD-mediated PA generation. These metabolic changes also lead to transcriptional and translational upregulation of the small GTPase RhoB, which enhances PLD-mediated PA synthesis and subsequent actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Our study reveals how disease-relevant perturbation of phosphoinositide synthesis induces an integrated response that ultimately boosts levels of PA, a key anionic lipid and metabolic intermediate in phosphoinositide resynthesis.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Historically, these have been performed manually in a time-intensive process, with reproducible trends, but a high degree of variability between individuals. To improve the reproducibility and throughput of lung morphometry, we developed AlveolEye, an open source, semi-automated, computer vision-assisted tool that rapidly and reproducibly calculates MLI and ASVD from images of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections. AlveolEye-assisted MLI calculation closely aligns with manually-derived measurements for corresponding images, with preservation of trends in measurements between uninjured controls and neonatal mice subjected to two different injury models. Analyzing human tissue of varying ages suggests that the approach developed in AlveolEye is generalizable across species. Notably, AlveolEye markedly reduced the average variation across individual analyzers, with the greatest improvement in precision among individuals with the least experience in performing lung morphometry. The design of AlveolEye is intentionally semi-automated, preserving the investigator's ability to assess and adjust parameters based on sample characteristics.

Here we show that defective Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) function in trophoblast progenitors is a molecular cause for early pregnancy failure. PRMT1 is conserved in trophoblast progenitors and conditional deletion of PRMT1 in mouse trophoblast progenitors arrests placenta and embryonic development leading to lethality ~E7.5. Remarkably, a subset of idiopathic RPL is associated with loss of PRMT1 in cytotrophoblast progenitors (CTBs). Experiments with human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs), derived from these RPL-patients as well as PRMT1-depleted hTSCs revealed that PRMT1 is crucial for trophoblast progenitors self-renewal. Employing RNA-seq and CUT&RUN-sequencing in hTSCs, CTBs and primary mouse trophoblast progenitors we discover that PRMT1 promotes transcription of trophoblast stem-state regulators, like TEAD4 and MYBL2, by directly enriching histone H4 arginine 3 asymmetric di-methylation (H4R3Me2a) at their chromatin loci. PRMT1 is also essential for extravillous trophoblast (EVT) development during human placentation, while loss of PRMT1 in hTSCs spontaneously promotes syncytiotrophoblast (STB) differentiation.

However, the mechanisms underlying auditory pain remain poorly understood. Developing behavioral methods to measure sound-evoked pain in animal models is critical for elucidating these mechanisms. Here, a deep learning-based approach was developed to measure auditory pain in freely moving mice by analyzing facial grimace and body position from video recordings during sound exposure. Facial grimace, a validated marker of spontaneous, ongoing pain in mice, was quantified using a deep neural network trained to extract established facial features. Postural changes, additional indicators of pain, were analyzed from the same camera angle. To validate the model, a known painful state, migraine induced by injection of the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was used. With this approach the ability to quantify a pain response distinct from baseline behavior was demonstrated, resulting in a defined pain threshold. Sound exposure at high intensities elicited significant changes in facial grimace and body posture, in comparison, surpassing the pain threshold established during migraine validation. These behavioral changes were absent in TMIE-knockout mice, which lack functional cochlear transduction.

Deep-learning-based approaches for sequence design have proven highly successful for various protein design applications, but many non-idealized backbones still remain out of reach for current models under typical in silico success criteria. We hypothesize that training objectives prioritizing native sequence recovery unintentionally push models to reproduce non-structural signals (e.g. phylogenetic relatedness, neutral drift, or dataset sampling biases), rather than a broadly generalizable structure-sequence mapping. Inspired by recent work bridging sequence likelihood and fitness prediction in protein language models, we introduce Caliby, a Potts model-based sequence design method capable of conditioning on an ensemble of structures. Conditioning on a synthetic ensemble generated from an input backbone allows sampling of sequences consistent with the structural constraints of the ensemble while averaging out undesired biases towards the native sequence. Ensemble-conditioned sequence design with Caliby reduces native sequence recovery while substantially improving AlphaFold2 self-consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art models ProteinMPNN and ChromaDesign on both native and de novo backbones. Finally, we train a variant of Caliby on only soluble proteins and demonstrate in silico that Protpardelle-1c binder designs that were previously deemed undesignable by SolubleMPNN are actually designable under SolubleCaliby, highlighting limitations of existing filtering pipelines.

However, there remain fundamental questions as to how B lymphocytes induce and regulate antibody glycosylation and thus functional capability. Understanding how transcriptional and cell state regulation shape glycosylation could reveal levers to tune protective humoral profiles in a disease- and antigen-specific manner. Prior studies have explored a limited panel of glycogenes and measured bulk glycosylation changes. Here, employing an in vitro antigen-specific B cell culture system, we systematically characterize transcriptional and humoral responses to cytokine perturbations. After exposure to a broad panel of cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, TNFa, IFNg, APRIL, and BAFF) across multiple concentrations and timepoints, transcriptomic profiling and lectin-based IgG glycome assays are employed to associate cytokine stimuli with both glycogene expression and IgG glycosylation. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning models identify cytokine-specific glycogene \"signatures\" as well as distinct immunoglobulin glycosylation profiles. We find that cytokines induce rapid transcriptional responses, with glycogene signatures outperforming single-gene changes in distinguishing stimulation conditions. We further demonstrate the ability to induce both pro- and anti-inflammatory IgG glycosylation profiles, particularly in terms of IgG galactosylation. This work demonstrates the utility of this system to parse the cytokine-driven regulation of B lymphocyte glycogenes, establishing a framework for dissecting how environmental cues shape antibody glycosylation, with relevance for autoimmune disease, infection, and vaccine responses.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Although there is a literature suggesting premature aging of the brain in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD), studies directly examining brain age are rare. Therefore, the current study was designed to estimate brain age in AUD individuals using brain morphological features, such as cortical thickness and brain volume. Methods: The sample included a group of 30 adult males with a history of AUD but maintaining abstinence and a group of 30 male controls without any history of AUD. Brain age was computed using an XGBoost regression model with 187 brain morphological features of cortical thickness and brain volume as predictors. An exploratory correlational analysis between brain age measures and features of neuropsychological performance, impulsivity, and alcohol consumption was also performed. Results: Findings revealed that AUD individuals showed an increase of 1.70 years in their brain age relative to their chronological age. Further, in the AUD group, higher brain age was significantly associated with poor executive functioning, while a larger gap between brain age and actual age was associated with lower non-planning impulsivity and later age of onset for regular drinking in those with AUD. Conclusions: AUD individuals manifested accelerated brain aging, possibly representing compromised brain health. Brain age measures were found to be associated with some of the measures of neurocognition, impulsivity, and alcohol consumption. These findings may have important implications for the early identification, prevention, and treatment of AUD. However, future studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Visual perception is heterogeneous around the visual field, it is better along the horizontal than the vertical meridian (horizontal-vertical anisotropy, HVA), and better along the lower than the upper vertical meridian (vertical meridian asymmetry, VMA). A recent study showed that visual adaptation is more pronounced at the horizontal than the vertical meridian, but whether and how the differential adaptation modulates the effects of covert spatial attention remains unknown. In this study, we examined how the effects of endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary) covert attention on an orientation discrimination task vary at the cardinal meridians, with and without adaptation. We manipulated endogenous (Experiment 1) or exogenous (Experiment 2) attention via a central or peripheral cue, respectively. Results showed that (1) in the non-adapted condition, the typical HVA and VMA emerged in contrast threshold; (2) the adaptation effect was stronger at the horizontal than the vertical meridian; and (3) regardless of adaptation, both endogenous and exogenous attention enhanced and impaired performance at the attended and unattended locations, respectively, to a similar degree at both cardinal meridians.

F.", "abstract": "Successful animal migration hinges on navigation and decision-making in dynamic environments. Yet, how individuals navigate transient, fine-scale landscape barriers, such as seasonally ice-covered water bodies, remains poorly understood. Understanding these responses is critical for forecasting migration routes and connectivity under global change. In the Arctic, rising temperatures are causing earlier ice melt and later freeze-up, reshaping landscape permeability and potentially disrupting migration routes for overland migrants, such as barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a keystone Arctic species, which relies on frozen lakes and rivers for efficient spring travel to calving grounds. While caribou generally prefer ice to open water, the behavioral response to changing ice conditions has not been quantitatively assessed. We analyzed 20 years (2001-2021) of GPS data for 406 adult caribou and daily MODIS land surface albedo to examine lake-crossing decisions at Contwoyto Lake, a long (> 100 km) glacial lake in northern Canada. We classified transit events as crossing or circumnavigation based on GPS trajectories relative to lake boundaries and linked behavioral decisions to spatially and temporally resolved ice conditions. Our models revealed distinct seasonal drivers. Spring crossing decisions were shaped by intermediate-scale ice conditions, with a behavioral threshold at the 56th percentile of annual albedo values. In fall, when the lake was ice-free, movement-related factors such as relative speeds along alternative routes better explained behavior. Our findings show how ice acts as a seasonal behavior filter, shaping functional connectivity through perceptual and energetic constraints. Although developed for caribou, this framework is transferable across species and systems. By linking high-resolution, spatiotemporal remote sensing to individual behavior, our framework quantitatively detects fine-scale behavioral thresholds in response to dynamic, climate-sensitive landscape features. This enables predictive, long-term monitoring of climate-driven shifts in migratory behavior and emerging constraints on adaptive limits, providing insights essential for conserving migratory corridors under rapidly changing ecosystems.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Fitness landscapes is a mathematical framework for rigorously analyzing evolutionary dynamics including study of epistasis, the main obstacle to predicting phenotype from genotype. In 2011, Poelwijk et al. formulated a theorem asserting that in a multi-peaked fitness landscape, \"at least two mutations exhibit reciprocal sign epistasis\" (Poelwijk et al., J. Theor. Biol., 272:141). However, their proof disregarded neutral mutations - a critical limitation that significantly diminishes both the theoretical value and practical applicability of the theorem. In this study, we reexamine the relationship between reciprocal sign epistasis (RSE) and multi-peaked fitness landscapes under the more general and realistic condition that neutral mutations are present. Our analysis reveals that when neutral mutations are allowed, the original theorem no longer holds. Instead, in cases when strictly neutral mutations could occur, the presence of RSE is guaranteed only if considering composite mutations - that is, groups of one or more mutations considered collectively in all possible combinations. Furthermore, when near-neutral mutations could occur - cases where the effect of a mutation is indistinguishable from zero - we cannot ensure statistically significant detection of RSE in the multi-peaked fitness landscapes even if considering composite mutations. Our findings have profound theoretical and practical implementations. First, - contrary to one of the consequences of Poelwijk et al.'s theorem - for each mutation in the considered multi-peaked landscape, the compensating mutation(s) do not have to be adjacent in the course of evolution: the compensation can occur after some neutral mutations take place. Second, in real-world scenarios where fitness values are measured with some uncertainty, there may be a fundamental impossibility to detect RSE in a statistically significant manner in multi-peaked fitness landscapes (both at the level of single and composite mutations).", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

However, the underlying mechanisms and variations in renal impairment remain largely unknown, and there is a lack of non-invasive imaging methods for detecting early kidney injury. Methods: We evaluated kidney injury through a multimodal approach, using a neonatal rat model of experimental NEC. Plasma and renal tissue were analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-1{beta}) by ELISA. Histological analysis and immunofluorescence staining were used to identify renal abnormalities and expression of KIM-1 and NGAL. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) was used to assess renal oxygenation and total hemoglobin as functional biomarkers of kidney injury. Results: NEC pups showed significant elevations of systemic and renal cytokines, as well as increased expression of KIM-1 and NGAL in proximal tubules of the kidney. Histological examination further confirms the renal injury in the NEC pup kidneys. PAI demonstrated reduction in renal oxygen saturation, offering non-invasive physiological biomarker assessment of kidney damage.

However, the development of advanced BCI applications, such as fluent speech synthesis, is dependent on the underlying information transfer capacity of the physical neural interface employed. A significant barrier to progress has been the lack of standardized, application-agnostic methods for benchmarking BCI system performance prior to clinical trials. Here, we introduce SONIC, a novel preclinical benchmarking paradigm designed to evaluate the information transfer rate (ITR) of a BCI system. This paradigm treats the brain and BCI as a noisy communication channel, where information is sent into the brain via precisely controlled sensory stimuli and read out by the neural interface. We implemented this paradigm in an ovine model by presenting rapid sequences of pure tones while recording neural activity from the primary auditory cortex with the Paradromics Connexus(C) BCI, a fully implanted system utilizing high-density intracortical microelectrode arrays with wireless power and data transmission. A convolutional neural network was used to decode tones based on neural features. Our results demonstrate an achieved ITR of over 200 bits per second (bps), which is the highest reported BCI ITR to date. For reference, this rate exceeds the linguistic information content of human speech. This ITR is achieved with a total neural interface, filtering, and data aggregation delay of 56 milliseconds. Further analysis demonstrated that ITR remains high (> 100 bps) for the lowest total delay tested (11 ms), supporting the needs of latency-sensitive applications (e.g., direct speech synthesis). This work establishes a new benchmark for BCI performance and demonstrates that the Connexus BCI possesses the bandwidth necessary to support highly advanced applications.

One central aspect is the potential role of environmental microorganisms as a source of resistance genes that could emerge among pathogens aided by horizontal transfer. In this context, previous reports showed that the Antarctic soil microbiota hosts a rich resistome, including putative beta-lactamases conferring resistance to beta-lactams, the most widely used antibiotics for treating bacterial infections worldwide. However, the diversity of beta-lactamases across different areas of Antarctica and Subantarctic islands and their associated microbiota remains largely unexplored. In this study, we analyzed an extensive collection of Antarctic soil metagenomes, applying a novel bioinformatic pipeline based on combining sequence identity and structural similarity criteria to search for bona fide distant beta-lactamase orthologs. We found several classes and families, with a notable predominance of class-B metallo-beta-lactamases, including proposed novel families and variants of known families. The beta-lactamase diversity and dominant classes varied across sites following changes in the microbial community, observing three main sample groups: 1) Subantarctic islands, 2) Antarctic Peninsula and surrounding islands; and 3) Cold-desert environments. The most prevalent beta-lactamases corresponded to subclass B3. We reconstructed more than 3500 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and searched for beta-lactamases among them. The main taxa encoding the beta-lactamases were Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota. Moreover, a certain proportion of beta-lactamases was associated with mobile genetic elements, especially integrons and insertion sequences, suggesting their potential dissemination by horizontal transference. This evidence reinforces the role of the environment, and especially (sub)Antarctic soils, as a reservoir of resistance genes, in particular, beta-lactamases.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed PDE3A2-modified RNA (PDE3A2-modRNA) to restore nuclear PDE3A2 levels and tested its efficacy in an angiotensin II-induced PCH model.

In this study, we investigated the effects of weekly shifts in light-dark (LD) conditions: two days per week with 6-h delayed LD cycles (simulating Saturday and Sunday), followed by a 6-h advance on Monday. Core body temperature rhythms rapidly entrained to the delayed LD cycles on weekends, and these delayed rhythms persisted even after the LD cycle was advanced on Monday. In contrast, plasma corticosterone rhythms on Mondays were aligned with the LD cycle but exhibited reduced amplitude. In the livers of SJL mice on Monday, the expression rhythms of Per1, Per2, and Hsp70 were delayed by 3-5 h compared to that in the controls, whereas Rev-erb expression rhythms remained comparable to those of the controls. The expression of lipid and glucose metabolism-related genes in the liver showed either delayed rhythms or no significant changes. To determine whether the dissociation of gene expression rhythms resulted from gene-specific responses to circadian body temperature and hormonal signals, we conducted ex vivo culture experiments using mouse liver slices. High-temperature stimulation induced Per2 and Hsp70 expression, while dexamethasone induced Per1 expression. High temperature and dexamethasone affected distinct sets of metabolic genes, whereas insulin induced only minor changes. Moreover, these responses were strongly influenced by the age and light exposure of the mice. We also examined the effect of weekly housing by providing environmental enrichment (EE), which had minimal impact on circadian parameters but promoted anti-aging effects on bone density and behavior. Overall, our findings indicate that weekly shifts in LD cycles induce internal desynchronization within the hepatic molecular clock and metabolic pathways by uncoupling core body temperature rhythms, hormonal rhythms, and gene-specific responses to stimuli.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Further anatomical and histological analyses showed that Pearl scale goldfish possess a thicker lateral body wall along with increased adipose tissue accumulation and reduced muscle fiber density, unlike Ryukin goldfish.

To address this, here we simultaneously measured electromyographic (EMG) activity of the jaw opener muscle and single-neuron activity from gustatory cortex (GC) so that we could characterize ingestion-related behaviors and their association with neural dynamics. We developed a machine-learning classifier to accurately identify distinct orofacial movements from EMG signals, thereby revealing multiple novel subtypes of ingestion-related behaviors. The frequency of occurrence of each shifts significantly around the time of the consumption decision, a change in behavior that is tightly coupled with the transition in GC's neural firing patterns into the state reflecting the tastant's palatability.

TBI disrupts cerebral metabolism via blood-brain barrier damage, altered glucose transporter expression, calcium buffering abnormalities, and oxidative damage to metabolic enzymes. AD-related hypometabolism is linked to amyloid-beta effects on mitochondria, including impaired respiration, oxidative stress, and altered mitophagy, fusion, and fission. We tested whether TBI-induced mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbates abeta-mediated impairment using a closed-head injury (CHI) model in APP/PS1 knock-in (KI) mice. Injuries were delivered at 4-5 months of age, before plaque formation and mitochondrial deficits in KI mice. Bioenergetics were measured at 1, 4, and 8 months post-injury in hippocampus and cortex using Seahorse assays on isolated mitochondria. At 1 month, genotype-by-injury interactions revealed greater dysfunction in KI mice than either condition alone, with males more vulnerable than females. At 4-8 months, amyloid-mediated effects predominated, while TBI-specific changes were no longer apparent, suggesting recovery or convergence onto shared mechanisms.

While high expression of integrins has been correlated with stemness, there is limited direct evidence that integrins mediate keratinocyte retention within the basal layer. Here, we generate mosaic, epidermal-specific loss of integrin-6{beta}4 (encoded by Itgb4) or its ligand, laminin-3{beta}3{gamma}2 (Lama3), using an in utero lentiviral-mediated approach. Although mutations in these genes cause postnatal skin blistering in mice and humans, we observe no evidence of epidermal-dermal separation embryonically. Despite no obvious alterations to apicobasal polarity, Itgb4-deficient basal cells show mild defects in oriented cell divisions, with increased oblique divisions and altered telophase correction. However, differentiation via cellular delamination, where basal keratinocytes lose adhesion to the underlying basement membrane and transit into the suprabasal layer, is elevated upon Itgb4 and Lama3 loss. Notably, hyperactive Notch signaling both decreases integrin-{beta}4 expression and increases delamination. These findings conclusively demonstrate a causal role for hemidesmosomes in regulating epidermal differentiation through both mitotic and non-mitotic mechanisms and shed additional light on the programs regulating delamination.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Roadkill hotspots concentrate animal movement and mortality, but whether they also concentrate animal-mediated seed flow (a key pathway of plant connectivity) remains unknown. In Mediterranean oak woodlands of southern Portugal, we used seed mimics to test how road type (paved vs. unpaved) and road-forest context (edge vs. non-edge) shape carnivore-mediated seed crossings, and whether crossings coincide with roadkill hotspots detected by kernel density analysis. Bayesian logistic models indicated that seed-crossing probability was about twice as high on unpaved as on paved roads (predicted means 0.28 vs. 0.14), with weaker evidence for a negative edge effect. Crossing probability also tended to increase with carnivore abundance and distance to streams, and decrease with rodent density, albeit with some uncertainty. Crucially, paved sections intersecting roadkill hotspots showed nearly threefold higher predicted crossing probabilities than non-hotspot sections (0.51 vs. 0.18). These findings support hotspot-guided mitigation on paved, non-edge segments (for example targeted speed management, fencing that funnels animals to existing culverts/underpasses, and verge management to reduce prey/scavenging attractants) thereby improving road safety while maintaining functional seed-mediated connectivity.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

In the Paleotropics, which is experiencing rapid expansion of tree crop plantations, few studies have compared floral and nectar-feeding bird communities, their interactions, and network organisation along a tree crop intensification gradient. In a cashew agriculture-forest matrix of the northern Western Ghats of India, we compared forests, cashew agroforests, and cashew monocultures to assess, 1) the abundance, diversity, and composition of flowers and nectar-feeding birds, 2) diversity of bird-flower interactions, and 3) network organisation. Floral abundance declined most sharply in monocultures, followed by agroforests. The abundance and diversity of nectar-feeding birds peaked in agroforests. Forests had the highest floral diversity and bird-flower interactions. Nectivore community composition differed across land-use types, with agroforests harbouring both forest specialists and open-habitat species typically found in monocultures. We found that sunbirds dominated plant-flower interactions across land-use types. After rarefaction (to control for differences in network size), agroforests and monocultures showed higher connectance, specialisation, and modularity than the forest network. Our results suggest that plantations that retain native trees (agroforests) can partially offset the alterations caused in floral resource availability and nectar-feeding bird communities by cashew cultivation. Planting bird-pollinated native tree species along orchard edges can make cashew farming more suitable for nectar-feeding birds, and has the potential to benefit cashew production by attracting avian pollinators.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

However, population-wide movement information is lacking for most migratory species due to the effort and expense needed to collect data across the ranges of species. BirdFlow is a probabilistic modeling framework that infers population-level movements from weekly species distribution maps produced by the participatory science project eBird. Producing accurate species-specific BirdFlow models has required model tuning using high-resolution individual tracking data, which is not available for most migratory species. Here, we introduce a new model tuning framework that eliminates this reliance on tracking data and generalizes BirdFlow to hundreds of migratory species. This framework allows us to tune and validate BirdFlow models using a combination of data sources, including GPS tracks, banding recoveries, and radio telemetry data from the Motus Wildlife Tracking System. We investigate the generalizability of this approach by (1) investigating predictive performance compared to null models; (2) validating the biological plausibility of BirdFlow models by comparing movement properties such as route straightness, number of stopovers, and migration speed between model-generated routes and real movement tracks; and (3) comparing the performance of models tuned on species-specific movement data to models tuned using hyperparameters transferred from other species. Our results show that the BirdFlow modeling framework achieves biologically realistic performance, even for prediction horizons of thousands of kilometers and several months. When species-specific data are unavailable, models can still be tuned using data from other phylogenetically adjacent species to achieve improved performance. Alongside this study, we release 153 tuned BirdFlow models, representing the first collection of large-scale population-level movement forecasting models and offering a foundation for more accurate predictions for applications in conservation, disease surveillance, aviation, and public outreach.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

This autosomal recessive disease is caused by mutations in the ADSS1 gene, encoding the enzyme adenylosuccinate synthetase (AdSS1). AdSS1 plays a critical role in the adenine nucleotide cycle, which is important for energy metabolism in muscle cells. Enzymatic defects, engendered by loss-of-function mutations in ADSS1, lead to a bottleneck in the adenine nucleotide cycle, causing metabolic dysfunction which ultimately results in progressive muscle weakness, mobility impairment, and respiratory and cardiac dysfunction, often requiring the use of a ventilator. Despite its debilitating nature, there are currently no cures or targeted treatments available, and little research into possible therapeutic strategies has been done. With a limited patient profile encompassing fewer than 200 known patients worldwide, establishing a mouse model for ADSS1 myopathy is critical to understanding its pathogenesis and for developing future therapies. Here, we present and characterize the first mouse model of ADSS1 myopathy -- a constitutive Adss1 knockout model -- by (1) defining its natural history, (2) exploring its metabolic pathomechanisms, and (3) characterizing its histopathological features. We find that Adss1KO/KO mice have subtle motor deficits and present with histopathological features consistent with patient phenotypes. Overall, we show that despite a relatively mild phenotype, this novel mouse model has quantifiable pathological features that can be used to develop therapies for, and further probe pathophysiology of, ADSS1 myopathy.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Thus, our knowledge of how real-world wind characteristics influence insects&' success and strategies to locate odor sources remains an open area of investigation. Here, we tested whether certain wind conditions were more favorable for foraging insects by comparing yellowjacket arrival times and corresponding wind conditions across three distinct natural environments. Our results indicate that Vespula pensylvanica are capable of locating odor sources across the full range of observed wind conditions, without any clear preferences. This suggests that insects have adapted strategies to perform odor localization tasks across the full spectrum of natural wind that they may encounter.

Static traits such as shape or color are well-studied, whereas locomotion-related signals remain less understood despite being particularly intriguing as they can be controlled by the animal's perception of danger. In this study, we explore the potential function of a highly conspicuous dynamic behavior - abdomen bobbing - exhibited by the diurnal jumping spider Heliophanus cf. cupreus during locomotion. Due to the high conspicuousness, we hypothesized that abdomen bobbing could function as a visual signal, specifically as an anti-predatory signal. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the behavior and found that bobs occur almost exclusively during gait stops (98.5%) with 83.5% of gait stops entailing abdomen bobbing. We then examined its context-dependency, measuring the prevalence of abdomen bobbing under four conditions: 1) control, 2) in darkness, 3) during prey encounters, 4) during simulated conspecific encounters (i.e. mirror), and 5) during predator encounters. Abdomen bobbing was virtually absent in darkness and during prey encounters, but significantly increased during conspecific and predator encounters, suggesting active control. The increase in abdomen bobbing when confronted with a predator strongly supports an anti-predatory signaling function, potentially a form of locomotion mimicry. We equally found support for an intra-specific signaling function, which might indicate the co-option of a signal from one context (predatory) to another (conspecific). Our study opens new avenues for investigating the role of motion in both inter- and intraspecific signaling.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Despite major advances in long-read sequencing technologies and graph-based assembly algorithms, current assemblies often remain incomplete and require refinement, including correction of haplotype switching and resolution of gaps, particularly within repetitive regions such as ribosomal DNA clusters and recent segmental duplications. These limitations largely stem from challenges in graph curation and are not adequately addressed by conventional polishing methods, which focus primarily on nucleotide-level corrections. To overcome these issues, we developed Verkko-Fillet, a Python-based interactive framework for genome graph inspection, editing, and curation that also provides step-by-step guidelines for downstream polishing. Verkko-Fillet takes as input Verkko output files, including the assembly graph, haplotype paths, Hi-C contacts, and additional ONT reads or alternative assemblies aligned to the graph, and offers tools for visualizing, modifying, and exporting curated assembly graphs. It enables users to track changes, resolve complex structural features, fill gaps, and enhance assembly quality beyond conventional polishing. As a case study, we applied Verkko-Fillet to the giraffe genome (Giraffa tippelskirchi), refining a draft assembly (QV 61.5) to a telomere-to-telomere (T2T) reference genome (QV 73.6) by improving both contiguity and completeness. Along with the T2T diploid giraffe genome, we provide gene annotations on this assembly as a valuable resource.

Their sensitivity to endogenous lipids and macromolecules allows for the early detection of neuropathological changes, making them valuable tools in studying brain health and disease progression. In this study, we systematically evaluate the repeatability and sensitivity of NOEMTR, tNOE, and MWF for quantifying lipid and myelin content in the brains of wild-type (WT) mice, correlating the results with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Methods: Five 6-month-old C57BL6/J mice were imaged using 3D-NOE, and four mice underwent imaging with 2D tNOE and MWF across four repeated sessions using a 9.4T Scanner. For ssNOE imaging, CEST-weighted images at 56 frequency offsets were acquired using B1rms of 1.0 T and 3s saturation duration. For tNOE, 52 offsets were acquired with a hyperbolic secant inversion pulse (bandwidth = 400Hz, duration = 44ms) and a mixing time of 200ms. For MWF, a multi-echo spin-echo (MESE) sequence was acquired with 40 evenly spaced echoes from 5.5ms to 200ms. For both ssNOE and tNOE, B0 correction was performed using WASSR. Repeatability was quantified using intra- and inter-subject coefficients of variation (COV%). Pearson correlation was performed to see the association between imaging matrices and IHC measures, Luxol fast blue (LFB) stained sections, and myelin basic protein (MBP). Results: All techniques demonstrated high repeatability across the whole brain (WB) and selected regions of interest (ROIs). Whole-brain intra-subject COV% for NOEMTR ranged from 1.92% to 3.40%, with corresponding inter-subject COVs of 1.50%. tNOE exhibited improved intra-subject repeatability with COVs ranging from 0.75% to 5.57%, but a reduced inter-subject COV of 2.97%. MWF imaging showed the highest stability overall, with an intra-subject COV ranging from 0.47% to 2.03% and an inter-subject COV of 0.75%. Visually, tNOE offers superior contrast in myelin-rich areas compared to NOEMTR and MWF imaging, showing greater sensitivity to myelinated regions. tNOE strongly correlates with histological markers: r = 0.83 with MBP staining and r = 0.72 with LFB staining (both p < 0.001). MWF and NOEMTR showed correlations with MBP (r = 0.63 and r = 0.57, respectively). Conclusion: NOEMTR, tNOE, and MWF imaging are reliable and repeatable methods for quantifying macromolecules in the brain. Among these, tNOE emerges as the most sensitive for detecting myelin lipids as confirmed by histological validation. These findings highlight the translational potential of tNOE for studying demyelinating disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

Right moderate contusive injury at the cervical 5 level (C5) was confirmed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemical staining. SCI compared to sham-lesioned animals showed significant motor deficits (grip strength, rotarod) alongside decreases in glucose uptake in sensorimotor regions of the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus, which receive monosynaptic afferents (the ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus, VPL) or multi-synaptic afferents from the spinal cord (the primary somatosensory and motor cortices, caudate putamen). In contrast, regions in the limbic system (the amygdala, accumbens nucleus, lateral septum, and hippocampus) and in the cerebellum demonstrated increases in glucose uptake in SCI animals. Most of these effects were noted bilaterally, suggesting functional reorganization involving higher order neural circuits bilaterally.

Behavioral Time-Scale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP), identified in vivo, holds a great potential for explaining instantaneous hippocampal selectivity emergence by long-term potentiation (LTP), yet the cellular and endogenous mechanisms are unknown, impeding broader conceptualization of this novel rule for its algorithmic, systems-level and theoretical implications. Here, we addressed this gap by in-vivo, ex-vivo, in-silico and computational approaches to seek neurophysiologically inspired protocols for synaptically evoking Ca2+ plateau potentials and inducing potentiation in the CA1. We found induction of BTSP-LTP is best explained by a theta-oscillation-paced, gradually developed cellular state being supported with precisely timed weak ramping inputs. Remarkably, the previously presumed one-shot LTP for in-vivo place-field formation is possible under the influence of muscarinic activation. Through modeling, the notion of acetylcholine-gated BTSP gave rise to a computational advantage for low-interference continual learning. We further demonstrated that biophysics of Transient Receptor Potential (TRPM) and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channels powerfully shapes the cross-theta dynamics underlying BTSP. These results which cover pre-, post-synaptic and neuromodulatory factors and their timing suggest fundamental principles for graded plateau potentials and hippocampal LTP induction. Overall, our work dissects cellular mechanisms potentially important for a prominent in-vivo hippocampal plasticity phenomenon, and offers a biological basis for framing BTSP as an input-dynamics-aware, neuromodulation-tuned synaptic algorithm.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

These behavioral phenotypes and changes in plasticity-related gene expression can be detected as early as 1 month after Tg induction, before overt neurodegeneration occurs. To assess early ultrastructural features in this model, we performed Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis in the cortex (Ctx) and hippocampus (Hp) of Tg animals and their non-Tg controls. TEM evaluation of Ctx and Hp revealed that synaptic density was significantly decreased and synapse length was increased in both regions of Tg animals. Synaptic cleft thickness was increased and post-synaptic density thickness was decreased only in the Ctx of Tg mice, revealing differential regional effects in synaptic morphology. We analysed mitochondrial density and we found an increase in the Ctx and a decrease in the Hp of Tg animals, with preserved individual mitochondrial area. Lastly, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis from both transgenic TDP-43-{Delta}NLS mice and human proteinopathy showed widespread decreased expression of synaptic structure and function genes. The alterations in synaptic density and architecture reported here, combined with the mRNA/protein expression data, suggest that TDP-43-{Delta}NLS mice may exhibit abnormal synaptic transmission and that ultrastructural changes play a role in the early behavioral deficits observed in this model.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

While diverse, ontogeny, transcriptional profiles, and phenotypes of meningeal macrophages have been described, little is known about their spatiotemporal Ca2+ signal dynamics in healthy and diseased states. Using two-photon functional Ca2+ imaging in a novel transgenic reporter mouse line, combined with an event-based Ca2+ signaling analysis pipeline, we comprehensively characterized the Ca2+ activity of meningeal macrophages both at steady-state and in response to cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), a pathophysiological brain hyperexcitability event, implicated in migraine, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. In homeostatic meninges of behaving mice, perivascular macrophages exhibit several Ca2+ activity features, including event duration and signal frequency spectrum, distinct from those of interstitial non-perivascular macrophages. The Ca2+ activity of dural perivascular macrophages is uniquely coupled to behaviorally driven diameter fluctuation of their associated vessels. Most perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages displayed propagating intracellular Ca2+ activity. Both macrophage subtypes also exhibit synchronized intercellular Ca2+ elevations, likely driven by an external factor. In response to CSD, the majority of perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages show a persistent decrease in their Ca2+ activity. Smaller subsets of both macrophage subtypes display either acute or persistent increases in Ca2+ activity, with the latter response mediated by CGRP/RAMP1 signaling.

We identified all major brain cell classes, with oligodendrocytes as the most abundant, and resolved seventeen transcriptionally distinct neuronal groups defined by neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neuropeptides, each with unique molecular signatures. Projection-specific analysis further revealed that glutamatergic subpopulations targeting the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and ventral medulla are molecularly distinct, marked by characteristic receptor motifs.

Six weeks post-surgery, mice were perfused, brains dissected, and immunostained for oligodendrocyte precursors cells (OPC) and mature oligodendrocytes (OL) in four brain regions involved in pain chronification: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (CeA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Results: We found OL were reduced in the ACC and CeA of both sexes six weeks after SNI. Conversely, BLA OL were increased in both sexes following SNI. There was a sex-dependent effect of SNI on PAG-OL, where OL were only reduced in females. SNI did not affect OPC in any of the studied brain regions, but female PAG and BLA appeared to have fewer OPC than males independent of SNI. Conclusion: Long-term nerve injury differentially affects OL in a brain region- and sex-dependent manner. This effect is observable six weeks after injury, suggesting a long-lasting impact of chronic pain on oligodendroglial cells. OPC, on the other hand, are remarkably stable.

So how can PER phosphorylation be programmed in a slow and controlled manner? Here, we show that the timing cues are encoded by PER-PER dimerization-mediated trans-phosphorylation, which enables the necessary time delay in phosphorylation and slow phosphorylation. When PER dimerization is disrupted, PER phosphorylation and circadian rhythms are severely compromised.

Answering this question is a central goal of consciousness research. Due to their subjective and ineffable nature, finding a quantitative way to characterise qualia from verbal description has thus far proven elusive. To overcome the challenge of expressing subjective experience, recent structural and relational approaches have been proposed from mathematics. Yet, as far as we know, no attempts have been made to evaluate the relationship between a certain structure of qualia and a structure of its possible underlying physical substrate. Towards this ambitious goal of linking qualia and the physical, we set out to make an empirical first step by focusing on qualia of visual motion in human participants and their possible neural substrate recorded in mouse primary visual cortex. From human participants (N=171), we obtained dissimilarity ratings of visual motion experiences induced by 48 stimuli, spanning across 8 directions and 6 spatial frequencies. Analysis revealed similarity structures of visual motion qualia that were disassociated from similarity structures purely expected from physical parameters or their combinations. From nine individual mice, we recorded single-neuron activity (n=751) with optical imaging in both awake and lightly anaesthetised conditions (isoflurane 0.6-0.8%, which retains neural responses and renders mice unresponsive to sensory stimulation). From neuron population responses to a similar set of motion stimuli, we computed a distance matrix that is comparable to our human dissimilarity matrix. Quantitative analyses show structural commonalities between human qualia structure and mouse neural structure, where a categorical organisation of stimulus direction best explains human qualia structure and mice neural activity.

In neuroscience, causal inference has been widely used in electrophysiological data to shed light on brain communication. Multivariate autoregressive models (MVAR) often form the basis of causal estimation methods. However, given the high-dimensionality of whole-brain data, MVARs can become too large for proper estimation, and reducing the dimensions to a reasonable range affects causal inference. In this study, we provide a clear, practical range for each parameter, motivate the choice of the causal estimation algorithm, and guide the optimization of model parameters for practical analyses. To that end, we simulate electrophysiological data with underlying causalities and estimate the causality with current algorithms based on MVAR models. We then model how the samples, signals, and MVAR order affect the performance and computation time of each algorithm. Our results indicate that, although all algorithms scale at least quadratically with the three parameters together, some are more sensitive to the number of signals and others to the number of samples. We further reveal that the number of samples required for accurate causal inference depends on the number of signals involved. Generally, more recent algorithms designed for robustness scale worse in computation time than older, simpler algorithms. Overall, this work highlights the need to consider scalability in Granger causality inference.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), also known as mitochondrial complex IV, is the terminal enzyme in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Consistent with the pivotal role of CCO in mitochondrial bioenergetics and high demand for energy to sustain neuronal function, CCO dysfunction has been linked to neurological disorders including AD. However, it remains unclear whether mitochondrial CCO dysfunction represents an adaptive response to AD-associated toxic molecules versus a bona fide pathology to promote AD development. In this study, by meta-analysis of publicly available proteomics analysis of post-mortem frontal lobe tissues from four large cohorts of patients with AD we identified loss of key CCO subunits including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded COX1 and COX3 as well as nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded COX5A, COX6B1, COX7C, COX8A, and NDUFA4 in patients with AD. Further biochemical analysis using post-mortem frontal lobe tissues showed lowered CCO activity of neuronal mitochondria from patients with AD, suggesting CCO vulnerability and its potential association with amyloidosis in AD. Lastly, in addition to the inverse relationship between neuronal CCO activity and brain amyloidosis in the tested AD cohort, pharmacological inhibition of CCO promoted amyloid production and elevated beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity in cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from one nonAD and one AD subject. The simplest interpretation of the results is that CCO dysfunction in the frontal lobe is a phenotypic mitochondrial change accompanying AD, which may contribute to the development of brain amyloidosis.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

They tend to occur intermittently in the form of bursts, rather than being produced as sustained and continuous rhythmic activity. Recent studies have shown that large visual sinusoidal gratings elicit two distinct gamma rhythms, namely, slow ({approx} 20-35 Hz) and fast gamma ({approx} 40-65 Hz), in the primary visual cortex (V1) of non-human primates. However, their mechanisms of generation and potential functional role in cortical processing remain unclear. Details of their burst signatures could potentially provide crucial insights about how the two rhythms influence network dynamics. Therefore, we computed burst statistics (durations and latencies) of simultaneously induced slow and fast gamma rhythms in the local field potential (LFP) recorded from area V1 of two adult female bonnet monkeys using several burst estimation methods. We found that slow gamma rhythm exhibited significantly longer burst durations and longer latencies as compared to fast gamma. Slow gamma exhibited higher long-range synchrony compared to fast gamma, as estimated by coherence and weighted phase lag index (WPLI), which could aid in enhanced global coordination in neocortex. Interestingly, longer burst length of slow-gamma could be replicated in a recently-developed noisy Wilson-Cowan network model by simply changing the firing-rate time-constant of the corresponding inhibitory interneuronal population, which leads to both slower and longer bursts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the two oscillations are generated by different inter-neuronal classes that operate over different temporal and spatial scales of integration.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

As a result, researchers have begun to explore individual differences, including potential sex-based variations in developing PVS. Meta-analyses in adults have shown that PVS are larger on average in males than in females, and several studies have shown a similar relationship in children. In contrast, no studies to date have examined the association between gender and PVS at any age. This cross-sectional study examined 6,538 youths from a large, nationwide sample of 9- to 11-year-olds in the U.S. to examine the relationship between sex, felt-gender, and PVS count and volume. Using a model-building approach, we conducted a series of linear mixed-effects models to determine the maximum variance explained in PVS count and volume, including age, pubertal development status, race, parent education, BMI z-score, and regional white matter volume, while also adjusting for MRI scanner and site. BMI z-score, age, and parent education were significant predictors of both PVS volume and count. Adding sex to the model improved model fit in all regions, and the further addition of felt-gender significantly improved model fit for PVS count in 5/6 regions of interest. Moreover, we found increases in PVS volume and count were associated with reduced executive function, learning, and memory.

Here, we combined optogenetics, two-photon holographic stimulation, and multi-electrode array recordings to identify the intermediate retinal cell types involved in this circuit. We found that the pathway formed by rod bipolar cells and AII amacrine cells (one of the primary relays of rod-driven signals under low-light conditions) plays a key role in mediating this surround modulation. Specifically, crossover inhibition exploits the same amacrine cells responsible for surround suppression to disinhibit distant ganglion cells.

Standard measures such as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) during hypercapnia capture only the amplitude of flow responses, providing limited insight into the timing of vascular adaptation. Temporal features, such as delay (onset latency) and time constant (rate of adjustment), together with gain (response amplitude) may serve as more sensitive indicators of vascular health, but cannot be directly obtained from conventional imaging. Here, we investigated cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal dynamics during hypercapnic challenge in healthy aging. Using a physiologically validated computational model, we estimated delay, time constant, and gain by optimizing the mapping of end-tidal gases to their arterial counterparts in a region-of-interest framework. Once parametrized using CBF, the model successfully predicted CBV and BOLD responses in independent experimental sessions. Across subjects, aging was associated with widespread heterogeneous region-specific changes in delay and substantial reductions in gain and time constant, indicating that cerebrovascular responses become weaker and less adaptable with age. These results demonstrate that calibrated simulations have the ability to track vascular aging, allowing the extraction of parameters that may represent novel biomarkers of cerebrovascular dysfunction.

The impact of neuropathy emphasizes the need to study its biology in order to treat patients early. The limitations of preclinical neuropathy models to date demand in vivo models that combine early nerve dysfunction detection with low mortality. Streptozotocin is commonly used to cause diabetes in rodents, but conventional high dose design often results in high mortality rates. In this study, I present a secondary analysis of a neuropathy primary model [8], focusing on the 4-week timepoint and validating proximal motor dysfunction in a short timeframe with high survival using F-wave metrics as early biomarkers. Methods: Male Wistar rats received low-dose STZ (30 mg/kg) on alternate days for one week (three injections) or vehicle. At baseline and 4-week, I analyzed blood glucose and body weight, and electrophysiological recordings (M-/F-waves) were performed at endpoint. Results: Rats treated with STZ had significant body weight loss (p < 0.001) and hyperglycemia greater than (20 mmol/L), which was aligned with a negative correlation (Pearson r = -0.77, p = 0.003). Furthermore, in diabetic animals, electrophysiology displayed that M-waves were unchanged, whereas F-waves were absent (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 91.7% of the animals were still alive at the end of the study, indicating a high level of survival. Conclusions: The new approach of this secondary study resulted in development of neuropathy at 4 weeks, accompanied by high survival, which in turn validates F-waves as an early biomarker of nerve dysfunction within a short timeframe. Thus, this new work provides an early and reliable platform for testing neuroprotective drugs and mechanistic work in the short term.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

In this two-day EEG study, we examined whether emotional salience from social cues (facial expressions) transfers to perceptually uncertain target images, and whether such learned salience is preserved in memory even after the social cues are removed. On Day 1 (learning session), we found no evidence for automatic emotional salience transfer across trials. Instead, ERP results indicated that social cue use was modulated by participants' metacognitive state of subjective uncertainty, as reflected in the P1 amplitudes. On Day 2 (test session), recognition memory revealed evidence of additive emotional salience: EPN amplitudes were enhanced for accurately classified positive target images previously paired with social cues. In contrast, LPC amplitudes were reduced for negative target images in the social condition, regardless of classification accuracy. Together, these findings suggest that the influence of social cues is contingent on subjective uncertainty. Social cues enhanced emotional salience when internal valence judgments were strong (as for positive images), but led to increased reliance on the cue - and therefore dampened memory encoding - when internal valence judgments were weaker (as for negative images).", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Along with mood, acute phases are associated with altered emotions. The biological underpinnings of these changes are unresolved, mostly because modeling the cycling nature of BD is still a major challenge in preclinical studies. One model is based on GBR 12909 administration, a dopamine transporter inhibitor aiming at mimicking some dimensions of mania. It has recently been shown that this model generates a mixed phenotype with negative hedonic biases and anxiety along with the hyperlocomotion. These studies have been only assessed in male animals, and other behavioral dimensions relevant for BD remain to be explored, in particular recognition of conspecifics emotions and reactivity to danger. The objective of this study is to further characterize the GBR model in both sexes by introducing two novel behavioral assays, the sweeping/looming disk and the negative emotion recognition tasks to evaluate response to threat and emotion discrimination. First, we replicated the previous results in the GBR model: higher anxiety, hyperlocomotion, anhedonia in males. These phenotypes were less pronounced in females. GBR also induced a hypersensibility to threat in both sexes in the sweeping/looming disk. GBR abolished preference for the emotional target only in males, suggesting altered emotion recognition.

This research gap is particularly concerning given that women are disproportionately affected by stress- and anxiety-related disorders, characterized by maladaptive avoidance. Yet, preclinical research has historically focused on male subjects, limiting our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying sex differences in threat responses. To address this, we investigated sex-specific strategies in adult Long Evans rats (10 female, 9 male) using a modified platform-mediated avoidance (PMA) task that created a high-conflict choice between reward-seeking and safety. Behavior was tracked over 25 days, with analyses focusing on a stable performance phase (days 20-25) objectively defined using change point analysis. The study design included an initial cohort and a replication cohort to ensure the findings' robustness. Females consistently prioritized safety, spending significantly more time foregoing reward to avoid foot shock, while males engaged in more persistent reward-seeking despite the risk of shock. This difference was not driven by differential reward motivation. Furthermore, female strategies were not significantly modulated by the estrous cycle. Thus, male and female rats employ fundamentally different strategies to resolve approach-avoidance conflict: females adopt a robust, safety-first strategy, while males demonstrate a risk-prone, reward-oriented approach. These findings highlight the importance of considering biological factors underlying threat responses, suggesting that characterizing these neural mechanisms may guide more targeted interventions for anxiety and trauma-related disorders.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

In spatial paradigms, some subiculum neurons manifest as so-called boundary vector cells (BVCs), firing in response to boundaries at specific allocentric directions and distances. More recently it has been shown that some subiculum BVCs can be classified as vector trace cells (VTCs), which exhibit traces of activity after a boundary/object has been removed. Here we propose a model of processing within subiculum that accounts for VTCs, taking into account proximodistal differences in subiculum (pSub vs dSub) and CA1. dSub neurons receive feedforward input, either in the form of perceptual information (from BVCs in pSub) or mnemonic information (from place cells in CA1). Mismatch between these two inputs updates associative memory encoded in the synapses between CA1 and dSub. With a range of learning rates, the model captures the majority of experimental findings, including the distribution of VTCs along the proximodistal axis, the percentage of VTCs across different cue types, and the hours-long persistence of the vector trace. Incorporating experimentally reported effects of inserted objects/rewards on place cells (place field shift), we also explain why VTCs have longer tuning distances after cue removal. This adds predictive character to subiculum traces and suggests the online use of mnemonic content during navigation. Our model suggests that mismatch detection for updating spatial memory content provides a mechanistic explanation for findings in the CA1-subiculum pathway. This work constitutes the first dedicated circuit-level model of computation within the subiculum, consistent with known effects in CA1, and provides a potential framework to extend the canonical model of hippocampal function with a subiculum component.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Several models attempted to explain these phenomena, often by adjusting the network to empirical manifestations, but struggled to achieve biological plausibility.

In particular, we associate stimulus space with the boundary of a hyperbolic embedding, and study the resulting neural dynamics in both rate-based and spiking implementations. The resulting localized attractors faithfully reflect the structure of the stimulus space and capture key properties of the receptive fields without fine-tuning of local connectivity, exhibiting a direct relation between a neuron's connectivity degree and the corresponding receptive field size. The model generalizes to stimulus spaces of arbitrary dimensionality and scale, encompassing various modalities, such as orientation and place selectivity.

The current gold standard catalogues released by the WHO represent substantial progress in using standardised data and methods to associate phenotypes to genotypes, but they remain opaque. The underlying data are not fully released and the catalogues are difficult to interpret. Open and reproducible methods would help address these problems, extending the important work already done. Methods We have developed an automated method, catomatic, that uses a binomial test to associate informative isolates with resistance or susceptibility, and built a catalogue (catomatic-1) from the same 39,358 samples used to construct the first WHO catalogue (WHOv1). We performed sensitivity analysis to optimise statistical and bioinformatic parameters for each drug, and benchmarked catomatic-1 against WHOv1 using an independent set of 14,380 isolates. Findings By using simpler statistics, catomatic-1 algorithmically classified 1,329 variants, ranging from 5 for linezolid to 440 for pyrazinamide. WHOv1 included generalisable rules added by a panel of experts, which increase the predictive coverage of WHOv1, but at the cost of reproducibility. Despite excluding rules, catomatic-1 achieves comparable performance for all drugs, with sensitivities for first-line agents above 88% on the independent test set. The automated process allowed us to efficiently explore the parameter space; for instance, detecting resistant variants with low read support improved the sensitivity for all drugs. Interpretation Accurate resistance catalogues can be built automatically using transparent and reproducible statistical methods.

In this study, the virus infected cell culture data suggest that the polyprotein undergoes a time-dependent processing to yield multiple capsid forms, ie, capsid, capsid-anchor, capsid-anchor-pr, capsid-anchor-prM. Among them, the c-anc and c-anc-pr were found to localize to the mitochondria upon transfection into the HEK cells. The transmission electron microscopy studies suggest that c-anc induces mitochondrial fragmentation. Further studies showed that c-anc affects the mitochondrial fusion-related proteins and the genes involved in their functions. The pulldown experiments indicate that c-anc also interacts with 1-syntrophin (SNTA1), a cytoplasmic protein that plays a role in redox potential, oxidative stress and mitochondrial biogenesis.

G.", "abstract": "The HIV capsid core encapsulates the viral genome for subsequent integration into host cellular DNA. Prior to nuclear entry, the core must translocate through the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC). This transit involves interactions between the capsid core and phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats found in nucleoporins within the NPC. Despite this critical role in the viral replication cycle, the molecular mechanism of capsid core translocation remains unclear. FG repeats consist of three classes of canonical motifs: FG, GLFG, and FxFG motifs. These are segregated within the NPC to define distinct zones of the gating machinery. FG- and FxFG-type motifs are enriched in the cytoplasmic and nuclear (nuclear basket) peripheries of the NPC while GLFG motifs are enriched in regions adjacent to the core of the NPC. To investigate the capsid core translocation, we use biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches to study FG-capsid interactions in a quantitative manner. We show that the capsid (CA) interacts with a range of diverse FG repeats with varying affinities. GLFG motifs of core NUP98 exhibit increased affinity to CA proteins compared to other conventional FG/FxFG. However, the non-canonical FxFG motif of NUP153 at the nuclear basket significantly increases binding affinity to CA compared to canonical FxFG, therefore called FG super-motif. In addition, C-terminal motif of NUP153 consists of a stretch of basic residues, which enhances the affinity of this non-canonical FG super-motif to capsid core at the NPC nuclear periphery. We identified other binding enhancers of the NPC core FG-NUPs, NUP58 and POM121. The relationship between the binding strength of FG/FxFG binding enhancers of NUP58, POM121, NUP153 and their position within the NPC also shows capsid core binding affinity increases with increasing proximity to the nuclear basket. Based on our data, the difference in binding affinities between the canonical FxFG motif and the enhancer-coupled FG super-motif of NUP153 to capsid cores at the nuclear basket is approximately 1,000-fold. Therefore, the diverse FG motifs and binding enhancers, which are naturally distributed within the NPC into distinct zones, create an avidity gradient - with changes in both concentration and binding affinity - along the cytoplasmic-nuclear axis. We suggest that HIV capsid translocation into the nucleus is potentiated by this gradient in a unidirectional manner (outside-to-inside) within the NPC.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Serological analysis indicated that a large proportion of the human population does not have any cross-neutralizing antibodies against this H3N8 strain. LPAI H3N8 displayed a dual affinity for a2-3 and a2-6 sialic acids and replicated efficiently in human bronchial epithelial cells.

We previously demonstrated that Chryseobacterium massiliae, a zebrafish commensal, protects larvae against infection by Flavobacterium covae (formely named F. columnare). Here, we investigated whether interference interactions contribute to this protective effect. We found that C. massiliae culture supernatant inhibits F. covae growth and a transposon mutagenesis screen identified mutants lacking this activity. All identified mutants carried insertions in a gene encoding a protein homologous to Bacteroidales BSAP pore-forming toxins, characterized by a Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) domain. We showed that this protein, which we named CSAP-1 (for Chryseobacterium Secreted Antimicrobial Protein) displays bactericidal, pore-forming activity that lyses F. covae cells. Unlike BSAP proteins from Bacteroides spp., CSAP-1 displays broader antagonistic activity, targeting multiple species across the Flavobacterium and Chryseobacterium genera - thus mediating interspecies and intergenus inhibition within Bacteroidetes. Although CSAP-1 is not essential for the in vivo protective effect of C. massiliae, administration of purified CSAP-1 alone confers significant protection to zebrafish larvae against sensitive F. covae infection. This study therefore identifies CSAP-1 as the first MACPF protein from C. massiliae with broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against members of the order Flavobacteriales. These findings highlight CSAP-1 as a promising candidate for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies and warrant further mechanistic investigation.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Background The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified concerns about its long-term neurological impact, with growing evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD). Patients with these conditions not only face higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes but may also undergo accelerated cognitive and motor decline following infection. Proposed mechanisms, ranging from neuroinflammation and blood brain barrier disruption to abnormal protein aggregation, closely mirror core features of neurodegenerative pathology. Yet, current knowledge is fragmented across text, figures, and pathway diagrams, hindering integration into computational models capable of uncovering systemic patterns. Results To address this gap, we applied GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o), a multimodal large language model, to extract mechanistic insights from biomedical figures. Over 10,000 images were retrieved through targeted searches on COVID-19 and neurodegeneration; after automated and manual filtering, a curated subset was analyzed. GPT-4o extracted biological relationships as semantic triples, which were grouped into six mechanistic categories, including microglial activation and barrier disruption, using ontology-guided similarity and assembled into a Neo4j knowledge graph. Accuracy was evaluated against a gold-standard dataset of expert-annotated images using BioBERT-based semantic matching. This evaluation also enabled prompt tuning, threshold optimization, and hyperparameter assessment. Results demonstrate that GPT-4o successfully recovers both established and novel mechanisms, yielding interpretable outputs that illuminate complex biological links between SARS-CoV-2 and neurodegeneration. Conclusions This study showcases the potential of multimodal LLMs to mine biomedical visual data at scale. By complementing text mining and integrating figure-derived knowledge, our framework advances understanding of COVID-19 related neurodegeneration and supports future translational research", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Through the creation of a library of LH2 variants using site-directed mutagenesis, we engineered proteins with different spectral properties to be expressed in a LH2-defficient mutant of the model PNSB Rhodobacter sphaeroides. We validated this approach by reproducing a previously described mutant with a blue-shift in the B850 absorption peak, in addition to identifying a novel mutant exhibiting a red-shift of this peak. We characterised the fluorescence lifetime of the purified LH2 spectral variants in vitro and performed a bacterial growth assay to assess the fitness of the LH2 variants in vivo under oversaturating light conditions. Our results suggest that the LH2s variants expressed by PNSB in nature reflect the intricate tunning of their quantum properties not towards the fastest energy transfer but the optimum light-harvesting efficiency which is defined by diverse environmental factors.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Both aromatic and positively charged residues can play this role, but they differ in their interaction types and relative strengths. An outstanding problem is the quantification of these differences, since they determine the fate of multicomponent mixtures. Here we focus on the two main positively charged stickers, Arg and Lys, whose experimental behaviour in condensates shows a clear hierarchy: Arg is consistently observed to promote phase separation more effectively than Lys. We use alchemical transformations together with quantum chemical calculations to resolve the differences in their cation-{pi} interaction strengths in different media. We find that, unlike the aromatic residues Phe and Tyr, Arg and Lys consistently maintain a hierarchy of interaction strengths across molecular environments, with Arg being favoured over Lys. While cation-{pi} interactions are important, the primary factor underlying this difference is the higher dehydration penalty of Lys. By contrast, the identity of the aromatic partner that forms the strongest interaction with a cation depends on the dielectric environment, in line with expectations from statistical potentials derived from protein structures. These results provide a molecular-level explanation for the distinct contributions of cationic and aromatic residues to condensate stability.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

However, monitoring these rapid chromatin changes in living cells remains challenging. We recently developed QUANDO, an imaging-based method that exploits a simple DNA counterstain to investigate the subnuclear localization of DNA damage in fixed cells. Here, we adapt this approach to track chromatin remodeling at laser-induced DNA damage sites in live cells using Hoechst-based staining. Specifically, PARP1-expressing HeLa cells are exposed to UV laser micro-irradiation in a defined nuclear region, and PARP1 and chromatin dynamics are monitored in real time. We observe that PARP1 rapidly accumulates in the irradiated region but with a heterogeneous pattern: PARP1 initially localizes to high-density chromatin regions (where the concentration of the sensitizer is higher) and gradually redistributes over the whole irradiated region. At the same time, we observe rapid chromatin relaxation, as indicated by decreasing Hoechst intensity and coefficient of variation (CV). In this framework, the PARP inhibitor Talazoparib has the following effects: it slows down PARP1 accumulation, it freezes the PARP1 heterogeneous pattern and blocks chromatin relaxation. Finally, we show that Hoechst-only imaging is sufficient to observe chromatin remodeling: measured chromatin relaxation kinetics are similar in transfected and non-transfected cells, confirming that staining with Hoechst is sufficient for studying chromatin dynamics bypassing the complexities of transfection. These findings underscore the dynamic interplay between DNA damage and chromatin remodeling, demonstrating how conventional nuclear counterstaining can reveal rapid chromatin changes at damage sites, offering new perspectives for investigating genome stability in live cells.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the adaptation of expansion microscopy (ExM) to visualise, and quantify nanoclusters of endosomal proteins of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE-1) cells. A 3D distortion analysis was developed leveraging the Farneback optical flow principle for detecting anisotropies in the hydrogel expansion. Analysis of pre- and post-ExM image volumes for 3D anisotropies revealed under-expansion of cytoplasmic regions within ExM hydrogels, often leading to over-estimation of size and distance measurements of small compartments such as endosomes. A self-assembling protein nanocage that reports the true local and nanoscale expansion factor was genetically introduced into the cells to calibrate ExM images of cytoplasmic regions containing endosomes. To stimulate and visualise the internalisation and sorting of EGFR1 in mammalian cells, a pulse-chase protocol was carried out with fluorescently-tagged EGF. The cells were subsequently fixed at 15- and 30-minute time points and subjected to 10-fold ExM and multiplexed 3D Airyscan microscopy to map cargo and EGFR1 vs other endosomal proteins. A volume tracing pipeline was developed to visualise the changes in the labelled EGF and EGFR1 densities at the limiting membrane of the endosomes. With multiplexed 3D ExM image volumes, we observed the enrichment of both EGF and EGFR1 in the endosomal interior and the accumulation of endosomal protein Rab5a near the limiting membrane during this early maturation of the endosomes.

While recurrent chromosomal abnormalities such as -5/del(5q), -7/del(7q), and del(17p) are well studied in this context, additional co-occurring events remain less well defined. Using the multi-dimensional Leucegene dataset (~700 primary AML specimens), we identified and comprehensively characterized a distinct subset of TP53-altered AML marked by recurrent deletions on the short arm of chromosome 3 (del(3p), > 20% TP53-mutated cases). These deletions frequently co-occur with del(5q) and encompass several ribosomal protein genes (RPGs), leading to a global downregulation of the ribosomal network and reduced protein synthesis. We show that this ribosomopathy-like phenotype is most pronounced in TP53-mutated cases with combined RPG deletions on chromosomes 3p and 5q, suggesting a cooperative oncogenic mechanism. Importantly, chemical screening identified HSP90 inhibition as a selective vulnerability in AML with low RPG expression.

Here, we evaluated the role of Slp in O157 adherence to the bovine RAJ using the RAJ squamous epithelial (RSE) cell- and RAJ-In vitro. Organ Culture (IVOC)- adherence assays.

Adherence was verified by culture and immunofluorescence (IF) staining of O157. Tissue integrity was determined using nuclear/cell staining dyes and histopathological examination. All test strains adhered in a diffuse-moderate pattern on RSE cells. However, differential adherence was observed on the RAJ-IVOC with the strains preferentially adhering to the columnar cells. Additionally, EDL932-WT and EDL932 Delta;slp-p:slp strains adhered in slightly greater numbers than the EDL932 {Delta}slp strain to the RAJ-IVOC, causing disruptions primarily in the columnar region of otherwise intact RAJ-IVOC tissues.

Understanding the complex interactions between KSHV, the host cellular machinery, and the immune response is essential for unraveling the mechanisms underlying viral persistence and pathogenesis. KSHV extensively remodels the host gene expression landscape by inducing widespread RNA decay via the viral endoribonuclease SOX. While the vast majority of cellular mRNAs are degraded by SOX, select transcripts including Interleukin 6 (IL-6) escape degradation. Interestingly, KSHV encodes a viral homolog of IL-6, known as viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6). Given the importance of IL-6 for KSHV biology and its ability to escape SOX-mediated decay, we explored how vIL-6 expression is regulated upon KSHV infection. Our data demonstrate that unlike IL-6, vIL-6 3'UTR does not provide protection from SOX degradation, yet vIL-6 mRNA steady state levels remain high throughout KSHV lytic cycle, suggesting a distinct transcriptional regulation. To assess the contributions of vIL-6 and IL-6 in modulating host gene expression, inflammatory signaling and KSHV-driven pathogenesis, we used a vIL-6 null viral mutant combined with an IL-6 knock down to perform transcriptomic analyses. This analysis revealed that depletion of IL-6, vIL-6 or both results in distinct alterations of the host gene expression environment, with differential effects on chemokine signaling and related pathways as well as a synergistic effect when both IL-6 and vIL-6 are present. Furthermore, functional assays confirmed vIL-6 alone is sufficient to activate key signaling pathways and pro-inflammatory responses, including the JAK/STAT pathway. Collectively, our findings suggest a mechanistic synergy between vIL-6 and IL-6 that may enhance KSHV-mediated immune modulation and contribute to viral persistence and tumorigenesis.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Techniques such as MS2 DIA and HRMS1 DIA exploit wide isolation windows and high-resolution MS1 and MS2 spectra to maximize protein identifications, even from low-abundance signals. In parallel, improved data processing algorithms reduce missing values and enhance the reliability of SCP data. These advancements are complemented by automated cell isolation technologies, which ensure precise single-cell handling with minimal sample loss, and in some implementations enable integrated, automated downstream sample preparation steps. Despite this progress, practical, end-to-end best practices for MS-based SCP remain an active area of optimization. Severe sample limitation, adsorption-related losses, the need for robust quantification across hundreds to thousands of single cells, and the lack of comprehensive protocols that systematically integrate and compare critical workflow variables complicate method selection and SCP implementation. In this context, this study builds on recent LC-MS based SCP advancements by presenting a complete, optimized, minimum user operation SCP workflow that integrates the Tecan UNO cell dispensing platform, a Vanquish Neo LC system, and an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer, applied to human primary cells. The workflow is designed to minimize data/cell loss, ensure high reproducibility, and maximize identifications. We evaluate key parameters, including acquisition schemes and LC gradient and column, and distill practical recommendations.

This mutation results in the production of an Ataxin-3 protein with an extended polyglutamine sequence, contributing to the disease's neuropathology. Currently, no treatment is available that can slow or halt the progression of SCA3. Gene-targeted therapies have gained significant attention for their potential to address the root cause of SCA3. Preliminary studies in transgenic mice using adeno-associated viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) encoding artificial microRNAs targeting the mutant ATXN3 allele (AAV9-miR-ATXN3) have shown promising results. However, to advance this therapeutic approach toward clinical application, further studies in an animal model that more closely resembles human biology are essential. In this exploratory study, we assessed the biodistribution and target engagement of AAV9-miR-ATXN3 delivered via intracisterna magna (ICM) injection in non-human primates (NHPs). Using a lentiviral vector (LV) to introduce a mutant Ataxin-3 cDNA with 72 glutamines (LV-mutATXN3-Q72) into the NHP cerebellum, we successfully overexpressed SCA3 in the NHP brain. SCA3 NHP exhibited Ataxin-3 aggregation in the cerebellum, recruitment of inflammatory cells and reduced cerebellar volume. ICM administration of AAV9-miR-ATXN3 effectively directed transgene expression to key brain regions impacted by SCA3 pathology and enabled specific, dose-dependent silencing of mutant Ataxin-3. Furthermore, the therapeutic dose prevented the cerebellar morphological and biochemical alterations induced by the overexpression of mutant ATXN3. These proof-of-concept experiments are crucial, not only for advancing AAV9-miR-ATXN3 toward clinical use but also for establishing a valuable platform for validating future therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Deadenylases remove poly(A) to initiate mRNA decay, while sequence-specific RNA-binding factors, including Pumilio proteins (PUM1 and PUM2), modulate these processes. We investigated how human PUM1&2 repress target mRNAs by accelerating their degradation. We found that the poly(A) tail plays a central role in PUM repression, dependent on the interplay of deadenylases and PABPCs. PUM-mediated repression requires the CCR4-NOT deadenylase but not the poly(A) nuclease (PAN). PUMs associate with and require PABPC1 and PABPC4 to repress. In the absence of PABPCs, both PUM targets and non-targets become unstable, bypassing PUM control. Increasing PABPC inhibits PUM activity in a concentration-dependent manner by stabilizing poly(A) mRNAs. Our results establish a Goldilocks principle wherein PABPC abundance tunes the response of mRNAs to regulatory factors through protection of poly(A) from deadenylation. Variation of PABPC levels across tissues and development suggests physiological relevance for this mechanism.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

However, drug resistance frequently emerges. Employing a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library screening strategy, we identified 523 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and 2183 protein-coding genes associated with abiraterone resistance. Notably, a pair of sense-antisense genes, BIRC6-AS1/BIRC6, was demonstrated to be a pivotal driver for abiraterone resistance. BIRC6-AS1 depletion led to a reduction in both the mRNA and protein levels of BIRC6. Moreover, depletion of either BIRC6-AS1 or BIRC6 enhanced the chemosensitivity of PCa cells to abiraterone both in vitro and in vivo settings. Further investigation revealed that BIRC6-AS1 stabilized the mRNA of BIRC6 through interaction with ILF2. Diminishing either BIRC6-AS1 or BIRC6 predominantly suppressed non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair activity, resulting in the disassembly of 53BP1 foci at DNA damage sites and an increased accumulation of DNA damage in PCa cells induced by abiraterone. Mechanistically, BIRC6 interacted with A20 and facilitated the K48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of A20 at the K337 residue. Additionally, A20 knockdown effectively reversed the abiraterone sensitivity induced by BIRC6-AS1 depletion. Collectively, we conducted a comprehensive screen to identify lncRNAs and protein-coding genes associated with abiraterone resistance and proposed that targeting BIRC6-AS1/BIRC6 axis represents a promising strategy to overcome abiraterone resistance in prostate cancer.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

This mutation induces a toxic gain-of-function of the ATXN3 protein, leading to neurodegeneration, particularly in the cerebellum and brainstem. Despite extensive research, no disease-modifying treatments are available for SCA3 patients. In this study, we developed and tested a novel therapeutic strategy using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to deliver bicistronic artificial microRNAs designed to selectively silence the mutant ATXN3 allele. Through in vitro screening, we identified a lead construct (miATXN3-10x2) that effectively and specifically silenced the mutant allele by targeting of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with the repeat expansion. This construct was packaged into rAAV9 and delivered via intra-cerebellar administration into two mouse models of SCA3, resulting in robust suppression of mutant ATXN3 in the cerebellum. To assess long-term efficacy, we performed intra-cisterna magna (ICM) injections of rAAV9-miATXN3-10x2 in a severe SCA3 transgenic mouse model. Widespread distribution of viral vectors and miATXN3 copies was observed in disease-relevant brain regions. Treated animals exhibited significant and sustained improvements in motor function at 5, 8, and 11 weeks post-injection. Histological analyses showed a reduction in mutant ATXN3 aggregates and a trend toward preventing shrinkage of cerebellar molecular layer. These findings were supported by dose-dependent reductions in mutant ATXN3 mRNA levels and decreased expression of neuroinflammatory markers in the cerebellum. Additionally, a significant increase of the neuronal marker NeuN was also observed in treated animals. Finally, transcriptomic profiling of the cerebellum demonstrated that treated transgenic animals exhibited an improved transcriptomic signature, shifting toward a wild-type profile. In conclusion, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of a single administration of rAAVs encoding bicistronic artificial microRNAs for allele-specific gene silencing in SCA3.

O.; Aizawa, K.; Sakai, T.; Aigaki, T.; Asano, T.", "abstract": "Resilin is a member of the chitin-binding protein family that was originally found as a component of an elastic matrix present in the wing hinge of insects. The matrix made of resilin (resilin matrix) is found in multiple body parts including leg joints. It has been considered that the resilin matrix may work in the absorption/relief of stresses accumulating at joints, or in the efficient transformation of muscle power to body movement. The knockdown of the gene for this protein in Drosophila melanogaster (Resilin) causes the characteristic downturned wing posture, and the knockdown flies cannot move their wings (and therefore they cannot fly). The jump distance of the knockdown flies is around 50% shorter than that of the controls. Null mutant flies show the same phenotypes, which can be rescued by introducing a genomic fragment harboring the whole region of Resilin. These findings indicate that Resilin plays important roles in normal wing movement and jumping. In vitro experiments have shown that the elasticity of the resilin matrix is due to the dityrosine-mediated polymerization of Resilin molecules. Dual oxidase (Duox) is the most likely candidate for the in vivo polymerization of Resilin molecules. Duox knockdown induces phenotypes similar to those observed in wing posture and jump performance of the Resilin knockdown and knockout flies, which can be rescued by the overexpression of Duox gene from a beetle. These findings suggest that Duox is an essential factor for the proper function of Resilin as the major component of the resilin matrix.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Several methods have recently been developed to capture the transcriptome of cells while retaining spatial information. However, these genome-wide sequencing methods typically lack the spatial resolution of individual cells and are confined to quantifying positional information within predefined lattice locations, thereby failing to capture large sections of a tissue outside these regions. Further, these methods are generally limited to profiling fixed cells with reduced mRNA capture efficiency compared to standard scRNA-seq. In addition, existing methods lack modularity and cross-platform compatibility, thereby limiting most of these techniques from jointly profiling the epigenetic and transcriptomic state of individual cells. To overcome these limitations, we present scSTAMP-seq (single-cell Spatial Transcriptomic And Multiomic Profiling), an approach that employs cholesterol-tagged photolabile oligonucleotides that incorporate into cell membranes, enabling us to stamp the position of cells using spatially imposed light gradients prior to tissue dissociation and single-cell sequencing. Applied to live cells, scSTAMP-seq efficiently captures spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes at high resolution for all cells within a field of view. Further, we demonstrate that light patterning enables dynamic spatial resolution, including the ability to map the position of individual cells. Finally, we show that scSTAMP-seq is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various downstream single-cell sequencing technologies. We demonstrate this by performing scRNA-seq using plate- and droplet-based methods, and by performing joint epigenome and transcriptome sequencing from the same cell while preserving positional information. Collectively, these results demonstrate that scSTAMP-seq is a sensitive and high-throughput technology for mapping single-cell transcriptomes and epigenomes at the spatial resolution of individual cells.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

To address this, we modeled and experimentally tested frameshifting and systematically characterized its evolutionary impact. We developed SLIPPERRS, a mechanistic model that identifies slippery frameshift sites achieving ~70% accuracy. Building on SLIPPERS' predictions and on our mass spectrometry and fluorescence-based assay, we characterized 165 short mRNA sequences. We identified dozens of novel sites with frameshift probabilities that often exceed those of known programmed frameshift cases, and found evidence for both translocation and decoding mechanisms. In Gammaproteobacteria, an average of ~100 genes per species harbor frameshifting sites, which alter proteins by truncating, extending, and fusing canonical proteins. We detect selection for shorter and less disordered frameshifted proteins to mitigate their deleterious impact. We found negative correlation between GC-content and the occurrence of frameshifting sites. In GC-rich bacteria, where frameshift products are expected to be particularly long and disordered, there is selection for cryptic stop codons.

Drug resistance often arises as cells undergo a dynamic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while elevated PD-L1 levels contribute to immune escape. While these phenotypic features can variably co-occur, the impact of co-occurrence on the availability of synergistic treatment strategies remains unknown. To investigate their interplay, we constructed an ER-EMT-PD-L1 gene regulatory network and simulated these networks as coupled ordinary differential equations with biologically informed parameters, to generate steady-state expression profiles. Our study revealed that the relevant overarching network generated antagonistic epithelial and mesenchymal modules, capable of producing monostable, bistable, and tristable dynamics. We further examined the link between phenotypes and immune evasion by quantifying average PD-L1 expression, and found that epithelial-sensitive states consistently exhibited low PD-L1. In contrast, hybrid- and mesenchymal-resistant states were associated with high PD-L1, highlighting a strong coupling between EMT, resistance, and immune evasion. Extending on these network-level insights, we further used a spatially explicit agent-based model seeded with GRN-derived phenotypes to probe tumor behavior under therapeutic pressure. Simulations revealed that tumor escape required co-occurrence of therapy resistance, motility, and immune suppression, with plasticity and multistability further promoting adaptive persistence. Lastly, we identified combination therapies predicted to constrain malignant diversification and enhanced immune accessibility.

With the discovery of ETV2 determinant role in specifying EC lineages during differentiation, researchers have adopted techniques involving ETV2 overexpression to produce h-iECs more efficiently and consistently. However, the capacity of these cells to form functional vasculatures has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Here, we generated multiple h-iPSC lines with inducible ETV2 expression, and subsequently differentiated them into h-iECs, which were validated functionally and by key endothelial markers and RNA-seq analysis. These cells are capable of self-organizing into stable microvascular networks (MVNs) in a microfluidic chip reproducibly, forming lumenized and functional vessels that mimic the in vivo capillary bed in both morphology and function - a result not achieved using h-iECs differentiated with conventional two-step methods using the same h-iPSC lines. Furthermore, complex microphysiological models featuring perfusable vasculature were also successfully developed using ETV2 activated h-iECs, demonstrated with vascularized tumor and blood-brain barrier (BBB) models. Additionally, by pooling genetically engineered h-iPSCs with inducible ETV2, we effectively employed an orthogonally induced differentiation approach to enhance vascularization of an organoid model.

Four propagation protocols were developed and assessed based on the dynamics of rooting and shoot growth, CLas colonization, and the response to oxytetracycline (OTC) treatment. CLas+ stem cuttings were treated with OTC via drenching at different developmental root stages. The roots or new vegetative flushes were sampled for bacterial quantification by qPCR. In Protocol 2, in which treatments were applied and sampled 14 and 35 days after planting (DAP) respectively, OTC-treated roots achieved the highest suppression of CLas and the lower incidence of CLas+ rooted cuttings compared to non-treated roots. Time-course analysis showed that OTC delayed bacterial establishment in root tissues, with maximal suppression observed at 35 DAP. The proposed protocols simulate the natural progression of systemic infection in citrus plants, allow the assessment of phytotoxicity, and offer a scalable technology that does not underestimate the efficacy of future bactericidal candidates.

Most Daphnia reproduce asexually through cyclic parthenogenesis, making the Daphnia system an ideal choice for studying epigenetic phenomena. Advances in gene expression control techniques, including RNA interference (RNAi), have increased the versatility and power of the Daphnia system. RNAi is a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that operates through sequence-specific cleavage of endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. Here, we used an RNAi bacterial feeding regime to target the three DNA methyltransferase genes in two clones of Daphnia pulex. We observed significant genotypic differences in response to the RNAi feeding regime, namely, the mortality of one clone. In the other, DNMT expression significantly increased in five of the six experimental treatments, with the highest level observed in animals treated with the GFP double-stranded RNA bacterial vector control. However, DNMT expression was reduced in all three DNMT RNAi treatments relative to the GFP control. Furthermore, we found strong cross-reactivity, where targeting one DNMT resulted in the reduction of the other two.

We show that this interaction contributes to the regulation of tau assembly in cellular models of tau aggregation and depends on the presence of the negatively charged residues. We determined that DnaJB1 inhibits tau aggregation in vitro through these interactions, and found that this weak, transient binding can be enhanced by the presence of polyanionic factors such as heparin. As prospective client-binding sites, we identified the charged hinge between the two {beta}-sandwich C-terminal domains I and II, as well as the conserved J-domain of this chaperone. This work presents novel biochemical and structural insights into how the molecular chaperone DnaJB1 recognizes full-length forms of tau protein in a pathological context.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

M.; Thomson, M.", "abstract": "Approximations for the existence and extent of physically permissible protein structures beyond those found in nature vary wildly. As predicted structure databases swell thanks to abundant sequence data and generative protein design models concurrently grow in their power to propose new aspects of protein structure, these questions and those of which essential features (e.g. stability, function, robustness) distinguish natural domains from novel ones have been cast in even sharper relief. We demonstrate that protein language models (PLMs) can simultaneously innovate in sequence and structure to suggest new-to-nature protein domains displaying supersecondary and tertiary elements outside of categorized CATH superfamilies. Developing and applying two orthogonal processes for obtaining compact and globular folds from PLMs without bias from other physicochemical or functional constraints, we discover putative novel domains that emerge parallel to known natural ones at rates far exceeding those obtainable by bioinformatic mining of structure databases. Computational characterization of these domain candidates indicates that many exhibit reasonable folding thermodynamics and kinetics, suggesting that natural protein structure-space is far from biophysically complete. These results point away from stability as the definitive selective force behind the observed landscape of real protein folds, and insinuate that many unrealized folds may be equally consistent with the structural rules of protein-based life.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Using a collection of 29 reference genomes of N. gonorrhoeae, we developed a pipeline that integrates Random Forest models and DNABERT embeddings to generate optimized gene panels. The results demonstrate that ML-selected panels substantially outperform traditional schemes, yielding markedly improved phylogenetic accuracy and branch support consistently above 90\\%.

L.", "abstract": "The number of structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has increased exponentially in recent years due to the availability of new methods to visualize increasingly complex macromolecules and their complexes in atomic detail. However, accurately refining atomic models from experimental maps remains a challenge due to limitations of current approaches for efficient model refinement. Standard PHENIX refinement can partially address these limitations with its speed and broad accessibility but often fails to yield the best model compared to those generated by more computationally intensive approaches. We therefore developed KNexPHENIX, a customized semi-automated PHENIX-based workflow to support optimal macromolecular model building. KNexPHENIX can be used to refine macromolecular structures obtained from both cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography and is independent of the nature or size of the molecule. We evaluated KNexPHENIX on deposited structures as well as on de novo models chosen based on their visual fit to the deposited map or generated by molecular replacement. Compared to other approaches-PHENIX with default settings, REFMAC Servalcat, REFMAC, and CERES-KNexPHENIX consistently produced models with lower MolProbity scores, indicating improved model stereochemistry. Importantly, this was accomplished while maintaining model-to-map correlation for cryo-EM datasets and maintaining or reducing the Rfree-Rwork difference below accepted thresholds for X-ray crystallographic structures, limiting overfitting while preserving refinement accuracy. These results establish the KNexPHENIX workflow as a practical, accessible approach for refining both cryo-EM and crystallographic structures, enabling the generation of models with enhanced quality metrics suitable for deposition and to guide further experimental studies.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

They differentiate into distinct functional populations, from pro- to anti-inflammatory phenotype, exhibiting remarkable biological plasticity and responding to both chemical and physical cues to achieve these phenotypes. Controlling macrophage cell phenotypes in vivo, with temporal and spatial control, could have significant impact on a wide range of human diseases and ailments associated with inflammation, which range from rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's to cancer tumorigenesis. Piezoelectrics, materials in which pressure causes a voltage and vice versa, represent a potential platform for non-invasive and remote modulation of cells and tissues and, in particular, control of immune cell activation. Here, it is demonstrated that RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cells that have taken up piezoelectric nanoparticles (pzNPs) specifically adopt an M1 cellular phenotype and requisite calcium ion influx upon ultrasound stimulation. One can further identify which cells have taken up pzNPs and which cells adopt an M1 polarization in mixed populations of pzNP-loaded and -unloaded cells.

However, intensive and often redundant sampling has raised concerns about sustainability and long-term conservation. Here we present the first systematic evaluation of whether micro-Computed Tomography ({micro}CT)--a widely used tool for digital preservation--affects ancient DNA (aDNA) integrity in human petrous bones. We analyzed 93 archaeological samples from Argentina, of which 50 had been scanned using {micro}CT and 43 had not. We compared six molecular parameters, including endogenous content, read length, cytosine deamination patterns and contamination estimates. No statistically significant differences were observed between scanned and unscanned samples across any parameter (Mann-Whitney/Wilcoxon tests, p <0.05). Although mitochondrial contamination was marginally higher in scanned samples (p = 0.051), nearly all values remained below the widely accepted 5% threshold for genomic analysis. These results indicate that, under appropriate scanning conditions, {micro}CT imaging does not compromise DNA preservation. Building on this evidence, we propose a sustainable, multi-step workflow that integrates biological profiling, osteobiography, imaging, and compositional pre-screening prior to molecular sampling.

Despite its extensive use, the mechanisms underlying many of its clinical effects, including attenuated postprandial glucose excursions, elevated intestinal glucose uptake, and increased production of lactate, Lac-Phe and GDF15, remain unclear. Here, we map these and other clinical effects of metformin to intestine-specific mitochondrial complex I inhibition. Using human metabolomic data and an orthogonal genetics approach in male mice, we demonstrate that metformin suppresses citrulline synthesis, a metabolite generated exclusively by small intestine mitochondria, and increases GDF15 by inhibiting the mitochondrial respiratory chain at complex I. This inhibition co-opts the intestines to function as a glucose sink, driving uptake of excess glucose and converting it to lactate and Lac-Phe. Notably, the glucose-lowering effect of another biguanide, phenformin, and berberine, a structurally unrelated nutraceutical, similarly depends on intestine-specific mitochondrial complex I inhibition, underscoring a shared therapeutic mechanism.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Management of the severe diffuse form of KATPHI currently lacks treatment options, as the first-line therapy octreotide is often insufficiently effective, necessitating radical pancreatectomy in many patients. In this study, we applied stem cell derived islets carrying KATPHI-causing mutation KCNJ11-/- to develop new pharmaceutical therapies for KATPHI. We tested seven candidate molecules in vitro, identifying three that reduced insulin secretion in KCNJ11-/- stem cell derived islets. Of these, we tested acyl-ghrelin and its long-acting analogue relamorelin in mice that became hypoglycaemic due to carrying human KCNJ11-/- stem cell derived grafts. Acyl-ghrelin and relamorelin alone increased fasting glycaemia. Combining relamorelin with octreotide increased blood glucose more than the sum of each drug alone, reversing hypoglycaemia to normoglycaemia. In conclusion, we show that ghrelin receptor agonists have acute anti-hypoglycaemic effects in a humanised mouse model of KATPHI, especially when combined with octreotide. Relamorelin has been tested in >650 diabetic adults with little side effects, leading us to propose relamorelin- octreotide combination as a novel therapeutic candidate for severe KATPHI patients.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

Arabis nemorensis, an endangered selfing species of European floodplain grasslands, experiences both flooding and drought and hybridizes with its close relative, A. sagittata. We investigated how these species differ in drought survival and the molecular basis of their responses. Sympatric lineages of A. nemorensis and A. sagittata were compared in a controlled dry-down experiment, complemented by transcriptome and small RNA profiling, and machine-learning analysis of cis-regulatory motifs. Both species wilted at 5% soil moisture, but A. sagittata recovered more effectively (90% vs. 50%). This difference was not explained by a major QTL, suggesting a polygenic basis. Tran-scriptome profiling revealed stronger induction in A. sagittata (6,359 vs. 5,571 differentially expressed genes). Small RNA analysis identified species-specific regulation of miR408, a con-served drought regulator. Machine-learning identified 307 sequence motifs predictive of stress-responsive expression, with motif distributions indicating distinct regulatory networks.

L.; Kurouski, D.", "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe pathology caused by a progressive degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Although etiology of PD remains unclear, accumulating evidence indicates that neurodegenerative effects are triggered by the abrupt aggregation of a-synuclein (a-Syn), a small membrane protein that is responsible for cell vesicle trafficking. a-Syn aggregates are highly toxic to neurons and immune cells present in the brain, including macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells. Transition metal dichalcogenide nanoflowers (TMD NFs) are novel nanomaterials with unique optical and biological properties. However, their effects on the immune system remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate cytoprotective properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) NFs on macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells exposed to a-Syn fibrils. We found that MoSe2 NFs exerted strong cytoprotective properties fully mitigating toxic effects of a-Syn fibrils, while MoS2 NFs were found to be significantly less potent in rescuing immune cells from a-Syn aggregates. At the same time, MoS2 NFs triggered polarization of macrophages into M1 and dendritic cells into M2 phenotypes, while an increase in both M1 and M2 was observed in microglia exposed to MoS2 NFs. MoSe2 NFs did not trigger polarization of DC cells and microglia in M1/M2 phenotypes, while MoSe2 NFs-facilitated polarization of macrophages into M1 was observed. These results indicate that TMD NFs could be used to improve viability of immune cells and attenuate their phenotypes, which, ultimately, can be used to treat PD and other neurodegenerative pathologies.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

E.; Pak, S. C.; Silverman, G. A.; Perlmutter, D. H.; Yoo, A. S.", "abstract": "How aging of human neurons affects dynamics of essential organelle such as mitochondria and autophagosomes remains largely unknown. MicroRNA-induced directly reprogrammed neurons (miNs) derived from adult fibroblasts retain age-associated signatures of the donor, enabling the study of age-dependent features in human neurons, including longitudinal isogenic samples. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that neurons derived from elderly individuals are characterized by gene expression changes associated with the regulation of autophagosomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria, compared to young counterparts. To clarify these changes at the cellular level, we performed live-cell imaging of cellular organelles in miNs from donors of different ages. Older donor miNs exhibit decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, which surprisingly co-occurs with a significant increase in mitochondrial fission and fusion events. We posit that the increased fission and fusion of mitochondria may reflect age-dependent compensation for impaired mitochondrial turnover, perhaps due to changes in autophagy. We subsequently identified a significant decrease in autophagosome acidification in neurons derived from individuals >65 years compared to younger donors, and a corresponding age-dependent reduction in neuritic lysosomes resulting in fewer lysosomes available to acidify autophagosomes. This age-dependent deficit in autolysosome flux was rescued by chemically promoting autophagosome generation, which also reversed the age-dependent increase in mitochondrial fission and fusion and improved mitochondrial health. Together, this work reveals a mechanism by which aging reduces autophagic flux secondary to a loss of neuritic lysosomes, resulting in in mitochondria-intrinsic mechanisms to avoid loss of energy production.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}

MoVUS leverages a balanced random forest model trained on dbNSFP v5.1a with high-confidence ClinVar and HGMD labels, using harmonized functional prediction rankscores. MoVUS produced confident, explainable calls, with ~98% accuracy (AUC ~0.998), prioritizing potentially pathogenic candidates and down-ranked likely benign variants on independent validation sets of ClinVar-only and HGMD-only variants.

We also had access to medical records and family trees for some variants, further validating our findings. Across held-out and external datasets, MoVUS reports high accuracy alongside confidence scores and helps prioritize actionable candidates, and reduces bias by considering multiple scores for each variant.

However, few in vivo roles for RBPs in the regulation of circRNA biogenesis have been characterized. We previously showed that many circRNAs increase with age in C. elegans, and that loss of circ-crh-1, an abundant age-accumulated circRNA, extends mean lifespan. Given the established role of the mammalian RBP NOVA2 in promoting circRNA biogenesis, we investigated whether nova-1, the sole C. elegans homolog of NOVA1/2, similarly regulates circRNA expression and function in vivo. RNA-sequencing of nova-1 mutants compared to wild-type identified 686 circRNAs. Of these, 103 were differentially expressed in nova-1 mutants compared to wild-type, with 76 upregulated and 27 downregulated circRNAs, suggesting NOVA-1 acts as a negative regulator of a subset of circRNAs. nova-1 mutants also exhibited linear alternative splicing changes, primarily in alternative 3' splice site usage and exon skipping, and showed minimal overlap with circRNA loci. Notably, circ-crh-1 represented a shared regulatory target, suggesting NOVA-1 may coordinate splicing regulation with the production of crh-1 circRNAs. Motif analysis further revealed that over half of the NOVA-1-regulated splicing events contained YCAY motif sites, with crh-1 harboring a high density of sites, consistent with its alternative 3' splice site usage and circRNA production. Finally, nova-1 mutants exhibited an extended mean lifespan and enhanced heat stress recovery. Together, these findings identify NOVA-1 as a key regulator of circRNA expression and alternative splicing in C. elegans, with likely downstream consequences for organismal lifespan and stress resilience.", "date": "2025-10-02", "journal": ""}
