H.; Brandt, U.; Fleissner, A.", "abstract": "Somatic cell fusion in Neurospora crassa depends on two MAP kinases, MAK-1 and MAK-2, but their precise contributions to directed growth have remained unclear. Using analog-sensitive alleles and live-cell imaging, we found that MAK-1 activity is required for RAC-1 activation and polarized actin assembly, while MAK-2 controls the positioning of RAC-1 and actin at the fusion tips. Inhibition of MAK-1 disrupted cell communication, prevented actin focus formation, and blocked membrane recruitment of MAK-2 and SO. In contrast, MAK-2 inhibition caused SO and actin to shift to alternative cortical sites, showing that MAK-2 regulates their spatial orientation rather than activation. Actin disruption with latrunculin A eliminated MAK-2 and SO recruitment, confirming its essential role in their localization. Importantly, MAK-1 controlled actin polymerization only during tropic growth, not during general hyphal extension, and acted upstream of RAC-1. These findings establish complementary roles for MAK-1 and MAK-2 in directing RAC-1-dependent actin dynamics during fungal cell fusion.\n\nSummary statementMAK-1 activates the Rho GTPase RAC-1 to drive actin polymerization, while MAK-2 orients this RAC-1/actin complex toward the fusion partner, defining complementary MAPK roles in somatic cell fusion.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Therefore, forecasting changes in species diversity concerning habitat conditions may be crucial for conservation strategies. We explored diurnal lepidopteran diversity in a modified landscape of subtropical montane forests of Jujuy, NW Argentina. We considered that degradation of the natural forest habitat would likely impact resources crucial for butterflies, consequently altering both species richness and composition within these forests. We assessed and compared alpha diversity through Hill numbers diversity profiles and beta diversity through the beta-diversity partitioning. Additionally, we employed a permutational multivariate analysis of variance, and rank-abundance curves of butterfly species across different habitat types. Our results suggest that land-use changes diminish the number of forest-dependent species and increase species more tolerant to modified habitats and open areas. While alpha diversity did not decrease as land use changed, beta diversity showed significant changes in butterfly species composition, with a worrying reduction of forest-related species in altered habitats. Species composition became increasingly dominated by open area butterfly species resulting in biota homogenization, with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning and services in these forests. Further research on the mechanisms underlying the effects of human-induced habitat changes on forest butterfly diversity could help clarify which mitigation strategies are most likely to be successful for the conservation of butterflies of the subtropical montane forests.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

S.; Parkinson, J.; Wang, W.", "abstract": "Protein language models (pLMs) have become essential tools in computational biology, powering diverse applications from variant effect prediction to protein engineering. Central to their success is the use of pretrained embeddings-contextualized representations of amino acid sequences-which enable effective transfer learning, especially in data-scarce settings. However, recent studies have revealed that standard masked language modeling objectives often produce representations that are misaligned with the needs of downstream tasks. While scaling up model size improves performance in some cases, it does not universally yield better representations. In this study, we investigate two complementary strategies for improving pLM representations: (1) integrating text annotations through contrastive learning, and (2) combining multiple embeddings via embedding fusion. We benchmark six text-integrated pLMs (tpLMs) and three large-scale pLMs across six biologically diverse tasks, showing that no single model dominates across settings. Fusion of multiple tpLMs embeddings improves performance on most tasks but presents a computational bottleneck due to the combinatorial number of possible combinations. To overcome this, we introduce greedier forward selection, a linear-time algorithm that efficiently identifies near-optimal embedding subsets. We validate its utility through two case studies, homologous sequence recovery and protein-protein interaction prediction, demonstrating new state-of-the-art results in both.

To date, researchers have used just one non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) in a given experiment; here, we validate a novel approach using two different ncAAs in a single experiment. This advancement facilitates the detection of differentially active subpopulations within the same experimental context, thereby reducing the uncertainty and variability associated with parallel treatments, and providing precise spatial information about organisms that are active under distinct conditions or at different times. We show that both ncAAs can be taken up by E. coli cultures and by constituents of the Little Sippewissett Salt Marsh microbiome, resulting in fluorescence signals that are significantly higher than background and ncAA-free control experiments, as well as differential labeling patterns reflective of distinct subpopulations. As a proof of concept, we implemented this \"dual-BONCAT\" approach in salt marsh sediments, adding one ncAA during daytime hours and the other at night. Subpopulations of cells that were anabolically active during the day and/or night were distinguishable by both fluorescence microscopy, and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Subsequent high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of active subpopulations revealed that Methylobacterium, potentially feeding on plant exudate carbon, was preferentially active during the day, while sulfur-cycling taxa dominated the night-active population. Dual-BONCAT offers an important advancement in multiplexing substrate-analog probing techniques, providing a more realistic understanding of metabolic activity under distinct environmental conditions.\n\nImportanceMicrobial communities are complex and dynamic, with different groups of microbes active under distinct conditions.

After validating the approach with E. coli, we deployed it in a salt marsh sediment community, finding that organisms potentially feeding on plant root sugars were more active during the day, and microbes likely metabolizing sulfur were more active at night.

This increased expression of YTHDF3 was closely associated with the incidence of lymph node metastasis and the progression to more advanced TNM stages. In vitro experiments demonstrated that YTHDF3 was crucial in promoting the aggressive characteristics of GC cells by enhancing their ability to proliferate, migrate, and invade, while simultaneously inhibiting apoptosis.

Importantly, aberrant kinase overactivation is a hallmark of many cancers including colorectal, gastric, liver, and breast tumors where dysregulated kinase signaling promotes malignant transformation, tumor progression, and therapy resistance. This underscores the clinical importance of understanding kinase-substrate relationships and precisely mapping phosphorylation events. In this paper, we introduce two complementary sequence-based architectures that operate directly on full-length substrate and kinase sequences. Stage 1 extends a task-agnostic prediction method, named Prot2Token, to jointly support three tasks: kinase-group classification from substrate sequences alone, kinase-substrate interaction prediction, and kinase-specific phosphorylation-site prediction while incorporating a self-supervised decoder pretraining task that predicts amino-acid positions from encoder embeddings. This pretraining substantially strengthens site prediction. Stage 2 specializes the architecture for phosphorylation-site prediction by replacing causal decoding of Prot2Token with a bidirectional one, yielding further gains. On standard benchmarks, the specialized model consistently outperforms widely used baselines. Beyond in-distribution evaluation, across both in-distribution and zero-shot settings of understudied dark kinases, we show the sign of zero-shot kinase-specific phosphorylation-site prediction capability.

Moreover, the proposed circulating protein biomarkers lack sensitivity and specificity, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches.\n\nIn our previous work, we characterized the transcriptomic profile of extracellular vesicles secreted by PM cells and demonstrated their feasibility as a source of circulating biomarkers. To further investigate the role of circulating RNA in tumor progression and its potential use in non-invasive testing for PM, here we present a detailed characterization of RNA cargo carried by PM exosomes - a distinct subset of extracellular vesicles known to serve as key mediators of intercellular communication. By utilizing primary cell cultures established from tissue samples of 11 PM and 6 non-PM patients, followed by exosome isolation, and total RNA sequencing of RNA from isolated exosomes, matching cells, and tissues, we provide new evidence on exosomal RNA secretion, regulation of PM-exosome cargo genes, and their potential functions in recipient cells.

A widely used approach is network modeling, where electrodes are represented as nodes. A key challenge lies in defining the network edges and weights, as precise connectivity estimation is critical for enhancing neural characterization and extracting discriminative features, such as those needed for task decoding. Traditional EEG-derived brain graphs often fail to capture biologically grounded organizational principles such as small-world structure and heavy-tailed (scale-free) connectivity patterns. To address this gap, we introduce a framework for inferring subject-specific EEG-based brain graphs that explicitly designed to exhibit small-world and scale-free properties. Our approach begins by computing phase-locking values (PLV) between EEG channel pairs to build a backbone graph, which is then refined into an individualized small-world and scale-free network. To reduce computational complexity while preserving subject-specific characteristics, we apply Kron reduction to the resulting graph. Using two public EEG datasets, we evaluate the proposed method on motor imagery (MI) decoding and brain fingerprinting tasks. Our approach improves MI classification accuracy by 4-7% compared to conventional PLV, small-world, and scale-free graph models, and enhances differential identifiability in fingerprinting by 8-20% across six canonical frequency bands. These gains were statistically significant in both applications. Moreover, integrating graph signal processing features derived from our constructed graphs with classical EEG features further boosts performance.

Deletion of pflB disrupts cellular pH homeostasis, impairing efflux pump function, increasing reactive oxygen species, and causing membrane depolarization, collectively heightening sensitivity to antibiotics.

These results indicate that gut microbes contribute to multiple components of ejaculate performance through distinct pathways, potentially including nutrient provisioning for spermatogenesis, acetate-mediated energy metabolism, and microbe-dependent modulation of female sperm use. By integrating microbial ecology with reproductive biology, our findings establish the gut microbiome as an overlooked but fundamental modulator of sexually selected traits.

Here we test the efficacy of the short-chain fatty acid sodium butyrate (NaB) to mitigate POE-induced deficits in a rat model. Both methadone and sodium butyrate treatments altered dam microbiota composition and function: notably methadone disrupted dam gene expression of microbial enzymes critical for butyric acid production and reduced faecal butyric acid levels. In postnatal day 9 pups, methadone increased gut barrier permeability that was reversed with NaB, and enzymatic disruptions were observed in pups at postnatal day 21 that resolved in adulthood. POE induced anxiety-like behavior in adolescence, and adult deficits in working spatial memory and attentional processing that were partially rescued in rats that had received prenatal NaB. POE was associated with decreased myelination in the hippocampus, and this was partially reversed by NaB.

P.; Gorjanc, G.; Obsteter, J.", "abstract": "Human-mediated movement of organisms for agriculture and ecosystem services often results in hybridisation and introgression between native and non-native populations. While introgression may increase genetic diversity, it can erode unique adaptations and reduce fitness, threatening the survival of native lineages. Honey bees offer a good model with extensive records, queen trade and migratory beekeeping facilitating genetic exchange among subspecies.\n\nTo explore these dynamics, we used SIMplyBee to simulated hybridisation between native Apis mellifera mellifera and non-native (C lineage) honey bee populations. We adopted the parameters from the Irish honeybee population that still maintains relatively low levels of import, but is threatened by commercial imports. The model included colony honey yield and fitness as complex polygenic traits. We simulated varying import rates, genetic correlations between fitness in native and non-native environments, and spatial distributions of introgression over 20 years, measuring levels and rate of introgression and genetic means for both traits.\n\nIncreased imports accelerated introgression and induced a trade-off between higher honey yield and lower fitness, and decreasing genetic correlations between environments amplified fitness decline. Spatial simulations showed the spread of introgression across the entire simulated area. Halting imports reversed the trend, but purging of introgressed material was slow and varied among replicates. These findings highlight the trade-off between short-term production gains and long-term losses in fitness and adaptation. Our modelling framework provides a reference for exploring introgression in other systems, emphasising that sustainable management of introgression requires restricting imports and breeding locally adapted populations rather than relying on non-native imports.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

However, such overlap can be misleading when the genomic regions under study are not independent. In these cases, coincident candidates may arise from the structure of the data itself rather than from true methodological robustness. To address this issue, we present a statistical test that compares, for a given set of SNPs, the observed distance profile between candidate sites detected by different methods with the distance profile expected by chance for the same dataset. This test is implemented in the KLinterSel program, which additionally identifies clusters of sites jointly detected by several methods within a user-defined distance threshold. As a proof of concept, we applied KLinterSel to evaluate the overlap among candidates from four selection-detection methods investigating divergent selection associated with resistance to the parasite Marteilia cochillia in the common cockle (Cerastoderma edule). KLinterSel statistically evaluates and visualizes the agreement between observed and expected-by-chance distance profiles. It uses Python's numerical libraries and vectorized operations for computational efficiency and includes multi-process parallelization options for memory-intensive datasets.

In this study, molecular evidence was provided for the occurrence of p53 at the subset of E2F1-driven promoters and their suppression, despite the co-occurrence of p53 with p300. P53 repressed promoters were characterized by relatively high nucleosome density and demethylation of H3K4, followed by low H3K27 acetylation and trimethylation of H3K4. Induction of the ATM/ATR-Chek1/2-p53 pathway by sub-lethal doses of cisplatin caused the release of p53 from gene promoters, chromatin relaxation and the gain of transcription permissive histone marks. Mechanistically, p53 maintained the KDM5B that is associated with gene promoters, thereby conditioning the demethylation of H3K4me3. P53 formed an immunoprecipitable complex with KDM5B, E2F1, p300 and H3K4me2 in intact cells, which decomposed with cisplatin and substantially increased the level of H3K4me3 in the p300 interactome. The extrusion of KDM5B from the chromatin was triggered by cisplatin, transient p53 silencing or KDM5B inhibition, also enabled p300 enrichment and increased gene transcription. In summary, p53 directly suppressed the subset of E2F1-driven genes in proliferating cells by maintaining KDM5B associated with gene promoters and inhibiting p300-mediated transcription.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

One question with important implications for adaptive decision-making is whether we learn about the absolute values of cues we encounter (how good or bad?), or about their relative values (how much better or worse than the alternative?). Humans have been shown to use relative value learning, even when it leads to suboptimal decisions. In this study, we ask whether insects employ absolute or relative value learning. Using the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we designed associative odour-taste learning experiments to distinguish both kinds of learning and find that larvae learn about the relative rather than the absolute values of both rewards and punishments, irrespective of the number and sequence of training trials. This suggests that relative value learning is a facility shared across the animal kingdom from maggots to humans, and can be accomplished even by small insect brains. Given the potential of D. melanogaster as a model organism for in-depth neurobiological analyses, our study opens up an opportunity to reveal the detailed mechanisms underlying relative value learning.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

D.; Estarellas, M.; Dauphin, M.; Pascovich, C.; Canales-Johnson, A.", "abstract": "In contemplative traditions, pure awareness (PA) is described as a wakeful state largely devoid of cognitive content, often considered a case of minimal phenomenal experience (MPE). Transcendental Meditation (TM) provides an excellent empirical model for PA because it is standardized, effortless, and reliably induces reports of awareness with minimal content. We combined electroencephalography (EEG) with phenomenological reports to study PA in 33 experienced TM practitioners and matched controls (performing mental counting). TM practitioners reported greater intensity and variability of PA than controls, regardless of years of meditation practice, consistent with the notion of \"automatic self-transcendence\". Using multivariate classification analyses of theoretically motivated EEG markers, we revealed a double dissociation in neural signatures. When contrasting TM with controls, temporal entropy and aperiodic dynamics were the strongest discriminators, while functional connectivity based on phase coherence contributed the least. In contrast, when TM was compared with its own baseline, low-frequency functional connectivity dominated, while temporal entropy contributed minimally to classification. This dissociation suggests that PA is characterized by a distinct EEG pattern of signal's entropy and aperiodic neural dynamics compared to ordinary cognition, yet stabilized by slow-frequency oscillatory synchronization relative to rest. Finally, TM showed little evidence of carryover effects from meditation into subsequent rest, whereas controls showed residual changes induced by counting. Together, these results provide the most systematic electrophysiological characterization of PA to date and establish neurophenomenology as a robust framework for advancing the neuroscience of minimal phenomenal experience.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

However, neural activity accounts for only a portion of the observed BOLD signal fluctuations, as the vasculature integrates multiple physiological inputs that contribute to the response. Research focusing on isolating the vascular components of the BOLD signal revealed that markers of cerebrovascular health, such as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), serve as valuable biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. This study examines the relationship between vascular metrics and noise in a cohort comprising individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HC). Vascular responses were assessed using three functional contrasts during a hypercapnic challenge: arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) reactivity, vascular space occupancy (VASO) to quantify cerebral blood volume (CBV) reactivity, and BOLD imaging. Noise metrics were derived from multi-echo BOLD resting-state data by isolating the TE-independent components of the signal. Mean correlation coefficients for noise vs ASL-CVR are: (-0.12 {+/-} 0.06) for HC, (-0.14 {+/-} 0.08) for MCI, (-0.11 {+/-} 0.05) for AD. Mean correlation coefficients for noise vs BOLD-CVR are: (0.25 {+/-} 0.11) for HC, (0.24 {+/-} 0.07) for MCI, (0.23 {+/-} 0.11) for AD.

These results suggest that TE-independent noise relates to the three vascular contrasts to varying extents and directions, with no significant differences across groups. Further analysis within specific functional networks revealed group differences in certain networks. The observed cortical correlations between noise and vascular features provide important insights into brain function and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, offering a potential avenue to disentangle vascular and neural contributions in brain network and connectivity studies.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

This study sought to define transcriptional heterogeneity of TAMs and map their interactions with ICC cells that promote malignancy beyond immune suppression. Methods: We employed three mouse ICC models, four clinical ICC patient datasets, and three spatial transcriptomic approaches to chart the macrophage landscape over time and space. Cell-cell communication analysis plus phosphoproteomics guided functional validation via TAM-ICC co-culture, cytokine treatment, gene silencing/knockout, orthotopic and metastatic ICC models, and three conditional knockout mice. A prognostic ICC tissue microarray with multiplex immunofluorescence and combinatorial blockade in mice tested efficacy of dual target inhibition. Single-cell ATAC-seq provided epigenomic profiles of TAM subsets, confirming M2 polarization networks via TCM treatment and gene silencing. Results: In advanced ICC tissues, an M2-like subset M{varphi}_SPP1, defined by high expression of SPP1,VEGFA, ARG1 and GPNMB, emerged as the major macrophage population, correlating with poor prognosis and spatially localizing to the tumor boundary. Further, M{varphi}_SPP1 drove ICC cell proliferation via the OSM-OSMR-STAT3-CCND1 and promoted invasion through THBS1-CD47-mTOR-DNB1 signalling. OSM and THBS1 were co-elevated in ICC patient samples; dual blockade of both targets in mouse models resulted in superior inhibition of ICC progression. Lastly, MAFB directed M2 polarisation and upregulated OSM/THBS1 in M{varphi}_SPP1.

Disruption of these networks is associated with cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to heart failure. Our previous work identified the transcription factor \"Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 1\" (ZEB1) as a downstream effector of Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding Protein 4 (CPEB4), an RNA-binding protein responsive to cardiac stress. While ZEB1 is known for its role in cancer metastasis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), its function in cardiomyocytes is not well understood. Based on previous findings, we hypothesize that ZEB1 is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and contractile function of cardiomyocytes. Hypothesis and objectives: We hypothesized that ZEB1 plays a critical role in maintaining cardiomyocyte structure and function. Deletion of Zeb1 may result in sarcomeric disorganization and mitochondrial dysfunction, whereas its overexpression appears to promote maladaptive hypertrophy. Our objectives are to: 1. Investigate if ZEB1 overexpression induces pathological cardiac remodeling. 2. Examine the effects of ZEB1 deletion on cardiomyocyte structure and function. 3. Identify ZEB1-regulated transcriptional networks. Methods: AAV9-ZEB1 was used for the overexpression of ZEB1. Using a myosin heavy chain alpha ( -MHC) Cre system, we created a ZEB1 conditional knockout mouse. To evaluate the cardiac function, we used methods like echocardiography, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry. We identified differential expressed genes upon deletion of Zeb1 using RNA-seq and integrated the data set with ChIP-seq. Results: ZEB1 deletion leads to sarcomere damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dedifferentiation, with more pronounced effects in females. Overexpression promotes hypertrophic remodeling. Echocardiographic analysis showed progressive systolic dysfunction, and histology revealed sarcomeric disarray, again especially in females. A tamoxifen-inducible ZEB1 knockout mouse model confirmed ZEB1's crucial role in fully differentiated cardiomyocytes. Conclusions: ZEB1 is critical for cardiomyocyte homeostasis, and maintaining its function is necessary for normal cardiac performance and structure.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

R.; Yan, G.; Yewhalaw, D.; Janies, D.; Lo, E.", "abstract": "Historically, Plasmodium vivax (Pv) malaria was rare in Africa due to the lack of Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) expression on host erythrocytes, an essential receptor for Pv Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP1)-mediated invasion. However, increased reports of Pv cases across Africa and among Duffy-negative individuals have led to the hypothesis that the parasites have evolved alternate invasion mechanisms that are DARC-independent. To investigate potential genetic adaptations underlying this phenomenon, we performed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyses of 110 Pv isolates collected from Ethiopia, comprising 38 Duffy-negative and 72 Duffy-positive infections. Pv from Duffy positives exhibited markedly higher genetic variation (477,561 SNPs) than those from Duffy negatives (197,461 SNPs). Chromosomes 1, 2, 9, 10, and 12 harbored the highest SNPs densities, consistent across both host genotypes but elevated in Duffy-positive infections. Among 43 erythrocyte-binding gene candidates, tryptophan rich antigen 3 and 34 (TRAg3 and TRAg34) and members of the merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) family showed the greatest nucleotide diversity per kilobase, highlighting these loci as potential mediators of host-parasite interaction shifts. Signals of positive selection differed by host Duffy genotypes. In Duffy-positive Pv, adaptive signatures were observed in genes related to drug resistance (chloroquine resistance-associated protein CG1 and 26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN2) and erythrocyte binding (MAEBL); whereas in Duffy negative Pv, positive selection was observed in genes linked to organellar maintenance and vesicle trafficking (plastid replication repair enzyme and the AP-5 complex subunit beta 1), implicating alternative metabolic or trafficking adaptations. Amino acid substitutions in invasion ligands (PvDBP1, PvEBP/DBP2, and PvRBP2b) were common in Duffy-positive Pv but largely absent in Duffy-negative ones, with almost half of the mutations located in critical binding domains. Overall, Pv isolates in Duffy-negative hosts displayed reduced genomic diversity yet retained high conservation across the genome, suggesting strong selective constraints and limited diversification. Phylogenetic comparison revealed that Ethiopian Pv clustered closely with other East African isolates, whereas Southeast Asian and South American Pv represented more distant lineages. These findings indicate that Pv circulating in Duffy-negative populations maintains a genetically conserved background, potentially reflecting stringent evolutionary bottlenecks and/or specialized host-parasite interactions required for invasion of Duffy-negative erythrocytes.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

The root-rhizosphere interface is central to nutrient uptake and serves as a key hub for interactions with beneficial microbes. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, positioned at the nexus between plant roots and soil microbiota, play a critical role in enhancing crop performance under nutrient-limited conditions. In this study, we dissected the genetic and molecular basis of AM fungi-induced lateral root development in maize (Zea mays), focusing on the role of ethylene-responsive transcription factors (ERFs). We identified ERF genes as essential regulators of pericycle cell division, acting downstream of ethylene biosynthesis genes (ACS6 and ACS7) and AM fungal signaling. Our findings reveal that AM fungi promote lateral root initiation by activating ERF expression and reprogramming flavonoid metabolism, particularly reducing the accumulation of flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin, which otherwise inhibit root development when over-accumulated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Massilia, a beneficial rhizobacterium, synergizes with AM fungi to enhance lateral root formation by colonizing fungal hyphae, degrading flavonoids, and contributing to auxin production. Together, our results uncover a tripartite signaling network linking ethylene signaling, flavonoid-mediated microbial recruitment, and AM symbiosis.

However, performance on downstream tasks is sensitive to tokenization strategies reflecting the complex encodings in DNA, where both regulatory elements and single-nucleotide changes can be functionally significant. Yet existing models are fixed to their initial tokenization strategy; single-nucleotide encodings result in long sequences that challenge transformer architectures, while fixed multi-nucleotide schemes like byte pair encoding struggle with character level modeling. Drawing inspiration from the Byte Latent Transformers combining of bytes into patches, we propose that  patching provides a competitive and more efficient alternative to tokenization for DNA sequences. Furthermore, patching eliminates the need for a fixed vocabulary, which offers unique advantages to DNA. Leveraging this, we propose a biologically informed strategy, using evolutionary conservation scores as a guide for  patch boundaries. By prioritizing conserved regions, our approach directs computational resources to the most functionally relevant parts of the DNA sequence.

In animals, the most prominent systems include PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and Kruppel-associated box zinc finger proteins (KZFPs). Because both systems recognize TEs in a sequence-specific manner and induce epigenetic silencing, they appear functionally redundant at first glance. However, KZFPs are a relatively recent innovation that emerged and diversified in genomes where the piRNA pathway was already established. This raises an important question: under what conditions can a second, seemingly redundant defense system invade and persist? To address this, we constructed a mathematical model integrating the evolutionary dynamics of TEs, piRNAs, and KZFPs. Our approach focuses on a key mechanistic asymmetry between the two defense systems: whereas piRNA-mediated repression is dependent on TE activity, KZFPs provide constitutive suppression that does not rely on ongoing TE activity. We show that these distinct modes of action generate interactions that extend beyond simple redundancy or additivity. We derive analytical conditions under which KZFPs can invade a pre-existing TE-piRNA equilibrium and characterize the evolutionary logic that enables stable coexistence of these multilayered defense strategies.

Here, we generated a single-cell atlas of 344,790 cells and paired T cell receptor profiles from primary tumor mucosa, adjacent mucosa, non-metastatic lymph nodes, and metastatic lymph nodes from 18 patients with treatment-naive ESCC. We identify compartment-specific immune and stromal architectures that shape distinct antitumor responses and suppressive programs. Primary tumors were characterized by marked enrichment of regulatory T cells (TREG) and activated dendritic cells coordinated through CTLA4-associated circuits, accompanied by accelerated CD8+ T cell differentiation toward intermediate and terminal exhaustion with loss of cytotoxicity. In contrast, metastatic lymph nodes preserved substantial pools of pre-exhausted CD8+ T cells with retained effector potential and strong clonal connectivity to the primary tumor, suggesting sustained antigen-driven trafficking. However, these reinvigoration-competent populations were embedded within a niche dominated by TREM2high macrophages that delivered SPP1-dependent suppressive signals to exhausted and regulatory T cells. Stromal lineages also displayed niche-specific specialization: tumor mucosa contained chemokine-rich inflammatory fibroblasts, whereas metastatic lymph nodes upregulated extracellular matrix remodeling programs. Together, our findings demonstrate that ESCC progression is governed by anatomically distinct exhaustion trajectories, clonal behaviors, stromal states, and suppressive circuits. This framework provides mechanistic insight into why lymph node response is a key determinant of clinical outcome and highlights the need for site-tailored immunomodulation strategies that target TREG-mediated suppression in primary tumors and TREM2high macrophage programs in metastatic nodes.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

M.; Zhu, Y.; Recchio, J.; Gresham, L.; Skinner, S.; Al-Khalil, K.; Krishna, B. S.", "abstract": "Numerous studies report that BOLD fMRI signal variance (SDBOLD) decreases with age. However, these associations may partly reflect cardiovascular contributions to the BOLD signal. For example, heart rate variability (HRV) has been positively associated with Resting State Fluctuation Amplitude (RSFA), which captures low frequency components of BOLD fMRI variability. HRV is also negatively associated with age, which could potentially confound age-SDBOLD associations. Yet, limited research has examined HRV-SDBOLD associations or tested within-person HRV-SDBOLD coupling using sliding window analyses of simultaneous HRV and SDBOLD. We analyzed resting-state fMRI data from two independent Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) samples: Core at M3 (n=115) and Refresher at MR1 (n=101). Partial Least Squares (PLS) analyses revealed significant positive HRV-SDBOLD associations (Core: permutation p=0.018; Refresher: permutation p<0.001). Whole brain age-SDBOLD PLS associations were non-significant via permutation tests across several models (Core: permutation p=0.201; Refresher: permutation p=0.121). We found age-related decreases in SDBOLD across [~]70% of voxels in both samples. Concordance analyses showed 67-69% of brain voxels exhibited negative age-SDBOLD but positive HRV-SDBOLD relationships, suggesting that regions showing age-related decreases in SDBOLD also showed HRV-related increases in SDBOLD. Sliding-window analyses demonstrated robust positive within-person associations between person-centered HRV and SDBOLD via different HRV metrics: SDNN (Core: p < 0.001; Refresher: p < 0.001), RMSSD (Core: p = 0.072; Refresher: p = 0.009), and low frequency (Core: p < 0.001; Refresher: p < 0.001), with non-significant effects of high frequency (Core: p = 0.516; Refresher: p = 0.12) HRV. Thus, regardless of baseline levels, windows with higher HRV corresponded to higher SDBOLD, suggesting that cardiovascular factors partially explain age-SDBOLD associations and HRV may mechanistically influence SDBOLD. These results suggest that controlling for HRV, especially low-frequency HRV or SDNN, may be necessary when analyzing SDBOLD to isolate neural effects.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

While SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated clinical benefits in HFpEF, the mechanisms underlying dual SGLT1/2 inhibition remain incompletely understood.\n\nMethodsWe utilized a murine model of cardiometabolic HFpEF induced by high-fat diet combined with L-NAME administration. Following disease establishment, mice received sotagliflozin (30 mg/kg) or vehicle for 10 weeks. Comprehensive assessments included echocardiography, indirect calorimetry, cardiac metabolomics, bulk RNA sequencing with cell-type deconvolution, and high-dimensional immune profiling by flow cytometry and CyTOF.\n\nResultsSotagliflozin significantly attenuated weight gain and improved glucose tolerance without normalizing blood pressure. Metabolic cage analyses revealed a sustained reduction in respiratory exchange ratio, indicating enhanced fatty acid oxidation, corroborated by elevated cardiac acylcarnitine intermediates including palmitoylcarnitine and dodecanoylcarnitine. Echocardiography demonstrated that sotagliflozin protected against diastolic dysfunction, normalizing isovolumic relaxation time and E/e ratio while reducing left ventricular mass and myocardial fibrosis. Transcriptomic profiling revealed upregulation of mitochondrial fatty acid {beta}-oxidation pathways and suppression of inflammatory signaling cascades including IL-1 processing and TLR pathways. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated reduced cardiac infiltration of neutrophils, CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, and IL-1{beta}-expressing immune cells. Splenic immune cell expansion characteristic of systemic inflammation was similarly attenuated.\n\nConclusionsDual SGLT1/2 inhibition with sotagliflozin exerts coordinated cardiometabolic benefits in experimental HFpEF through metabolic reprogramming toward enhanced lipid utilization and suppression of cardiac and systemic inflammation.

K.; Penfield, L.; Smith, M.; Montell, D.", "abstract": "The small GTPase Rac is an essential regulator of cell shape, migration, macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. We recently reported that expression of constitutively active RacG12V is sufficient to cause a few migratory cells called border cells to cannibalize nurse cells in the Drosophila ovary. Building on that insight, we engineered mammalian Rac-enhanced chimeric-antigen-receptor macrophages (RaceCAR-Ms) to avidly engulf and kill cancer cells. Here we investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which border cells efficiently kill the much larger nurse cells. Surprisingly, wild type border cells normally nibble on nurse cells as they migrate between them, and RacG12V causes border cells to take larger, lethal bites. These larger bites trigger rapid germline shrinkage, nuclear damage, and caspase activation, which spreads through the nurse cell syncytium. Then, many somatic follicle cells join in to engulf the dying germline. Rac and the engulfment receptor Draper are critical for both sublethal nibbling and lethal phagocytosis. Using clonal analysis, we show small groups of follicle cells expressing RacG12V induced caspase activation in neighboring follicle cells while larger RacG12V clones were required to cause germline killing. Increasing Draper expression or JNK activity in border cells also caused germline death, in a Rac-independent manner, suggesting that border cells can be activated to kill through multiple mechanisms. The series of events elucidated here reveals how hyperactivated Rac expressed in a few cells can trigger destruction of a much larger mass of cells.\n\nSignificance StatementRac is a key protein in the cellular eating process called phagocytosis. Rac hyperactivity enhances the consumption of tumor cells by chimeric antigen receptor-macrophages (CAR-M), a promising type of cellular immunotherapy. Elucidating the mechanisms by which hyperactive Rac enhances cell killing may lead to improvements in CAR-M. Key insights into the in vivo effects of Rac have come from studying Drosophila oogenesis. Here we report molecular and cellular mechanisms by which hyperactivated Rac stimulates migratory cells to engulf and kill much larger cells in the fly ovary, ultimately resulting in destruction of the entire tissue. These insights have implications for how hyperactivating Rac might improve antibody and CAR-M therapies for cancer and other diseases.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

S.; Edwards, M.; Fritz-Laylin, L.", "abstract": "The \"brain-eating amoeba\" Naegleria fowleri dwells in ponds where it normally feeds on bacteria, but if it enters the brain it can cause a deadly infection. To establish infection, N. fowleri must migrate through different environments--along olfactory axons, through openings in the cribriform plate, and within brain tissue--yet how it does so remains unknown. As a model for N. fowleri migration within these environments, we examine how its non-pathogenic relative, Naegleria gruberi, navigates environments of distinct geometries. We show that Naegleria uses both actin-rich protrusions and membrane blebs to crawl across or between flat surfaces. We also explore how Naegleria interact with narrow channels and find that, unlike Dictyostelium amoebae that we show frequently disengage from channel interfaces, Naegleria amoebae probe channels until they enter. Once inside, Naegleria crawls quickly (>50 m/min) and unidirectionally over long distances (>1 mm) using only bleb-based motility. We also introduced Naegleria to granular hydrogel matrices that mimic pond sediments and found that cells readily enter and migrate through these three-dimensional matrices using both blebs and lamellar protrusions. Although cells in matrices showed lower persistence at short timescales, longer time scales correlate with increased persistence, suggesting Naegleria cells may retain memory of past orientation. We propose that pond life may select for three behaviors that prime Naegleria for pathogenesis: memory-guided motility that would facilitate exploration of sinus cavities, confinement-seeking (\"claustrophilia\") that would promote entry into narrow passages along olfactory axons, and fast bleb-based migration that would allow rapid transit along axons to the brain.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe \"brain-eating amoeba\" Naegleria fowleri causes a devastating brain infection with a [~]95% fatality rate, yet how these normally harmless pond-dwellers invade the human brain remains mysterious. Using the model species N. gruberi, we show that Naegleria amoebae exhibit three key behaviors: they retain directional memory during exploration, actively enter confined spaces, and crawl rapidly and persistently through narrow channels for millimeter-scale distances. We propose these behaviors are adaptations for hunting bacteria in pond sediments that inadvertently enable pathogenesis--directional memory facilitates sinus exploration, confinement-seeking draws amoebae into spaces between olfactory axons, and persistent channel migration enables rapid transit to the brain.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Intraflagellar transport-20 (IFT20), a unique IFT-B component, localizes to both the Golgi and cilia, suggesting a central role in ciliary trafficking. We analyzed the IFT20-mediated trafficking (CrIFT20) of photoreceptor channelrhodopsin-1 (ChR1) in the cilia of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using an integrative approach that combines computational and experimental methods. The sequence homology and structural modelling reveal a conserved C-terminal coiled-coil domain in IFT20, supporting its canonical function in IFT-B assembly. Furthermore, the heterologous expression and spectroscopic characterization demonstrate that recombinant CrIFT20 is structurally stable and undergoes GTP-dependent structural rearrangements. This is consistent with our docking analyses, which show that human Arf4 homolog in C. reinhardtii, small ARF-related GTPase (CrARFA1A) interacts with the conserved coiled-coil region of CrIFT20 in a GTP-binding interface. Interaction network mapping and structural docking supported a conserved mechanism in which CrIFT20 couples ciliary trafficking with IFT-B and BBSome components, such as BBS1, for precise delivery of ciliary membrane cargo. The IFT81 and BBS1 mutants of C. reinhardtii mislocalizes IFT20-ChR1 complex in cilia and disrupts photoreceptor distribution, as supported by structural models that reveal the corresponding adaptor-cargo interfaces. Our results identify CrIFT20 as an essential adaptor linking IFT-B complex, CrARFA1A-mediated membrane trafficking, and BBSome-dependent sorting to direct ChR1 localization within the cilia of Chlamydomonas. These findings expand the mechanistic understanding of photoreceptor delivery in algae, and reveal a conserved role of IFT20 in photoreceptor trafficking, illuminating how coordinated adaptor, motor, and cargo selection maintain the polarized architecture of the cilia.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

It occurs through the action of specific enzymes that modify the nucleotides within the tRNA molecule. Our previous study demonstrated tRNA modopathies and altered queuine-related metabolites in inflammatory bowel diseases. Queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase catalytic subunit 1 (QTRT1) and QTRT 2 co-localize in mitochondria and form a heterodimeric TGT participating in tRNA Queuosine (tRNA-Q) modification. Human body acquires Queuine/Vitamin Q from intestinal microbiota or from diet. However, the roles of tRNA-Q modifications in the maintenance of intestinal mitochondrial homeostasis and microbiome are still unclear.\n\nMethodsWe used publicly available human IBD datasets, QTRT1 knockout (KO) mice, QTRT1 intestinal epithelial conditional KO (QTRT1{Delta}IEC) mice, cultured cell lines with QTRT1-specific siRNA, and organoids from patients with IBD to investigate the mechanism of tRNA-Q modifications in intestinal mitochondrial homeostasis and therapeutic potential in anti-inflammation.\n\nResultsIn single cell RNA sequencing datasets of human IBD, we identified significant reduced intestinal epithelial QTRT1 expression in the patients with Crohns Disease. Using publicly available datasets, we identified significantly changes of Vitamin Q-associated bacteria in human IBD, compared to the healthy control. Qtrt1-/- mice had significant reduction of Q-associated bacteria, e.g., Bacteroides. Alcian Blue and Mucin-2 staining revealed mucosal barrier damage and disrupted homeostasis, with reduced colonic cell proliferation. Intestinal tight junction integrity was impaired in QTRT1-KO mice, as evidenced by reduced ZO-1 and increased Claudin-10 expression. QTRT1{Delta}IEC mice also showed dysbiosis and disrupted TJs. ATP synthesis was significantly decreased in the colon of QTRT1-KO mice, accompanied by severe mitochondrial dysfunction: reduced mitochondrial quality, Cytochrome-C release, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributed to colonic cell death, as shown by elevated expressions of Cleaved Caspase-3 and Cleaved Caspase-1, increased BAX/Bcl-2 ratio, and positive TUNEL signals. Elevated CDC42, CD14, and CD4 levels in QTRT1-KO colon suggested mucosal immune activation and tissue repair responses. QTRT1-deficient CaCO2-BBE cells showed mitochondrial dysfunction. Cytochrome-C and mito-DNA release leading to cell death characterized by elevated expressions of Cleaved Caspase-3 and Caspase-1, increased BAX/Bcl-2 ratio, and higher apoptosis rate. Organoids isolated from patients with IBD showed reduced levels of QTRT1 and dysfunctional mitochondria. Restoring mitochondrial function leads to enhanced QTRT1.\n\nConclusionsThese findings underscore the critical role of QTRT1/Q-tRNA modification in maintaining intestinal and microbial homeostasis.

While focal adhesions avoid these features, fibrillar adhesions rapidly align along pre-existing fibrous cell-derived matrix or electrospun nanofibers where they can then template fibronectin fibrils. Topography-induced fibrillar adhesions depend primarily on 5{beta}1-integrin clustering and disassemble upon cortical stiffening driven by myosin-II overactivation or increased membrane tension. We propose a generic theoretical model where the adhesion receptor favours the membrane and substrate planes to be tilted relative to each other. This model matches experimental observations of preferential 5{beta}1-integrin clustering along nanofibers and concave edges of large negative curvature along micro-ridges.

While senescent cells are heterogenous and increasingly persistent in vivo with age, the mechanisms underlying their heterogeneity, resistance to apoptosis, and tissue accumulation remain insufficiently understood. Here we report that in response to DNA damage, a subset of senescent cells upregulates the v-type ATPase subunit, ATP6V1B2 (V1B2) on the cell surface. This upregulation is associated with altered lysosomal activity and changes in intracellular pH. Heterogeneity of senescent cells marked by cell surface V1B2 (csV1B2) is present in naturally occurring senescent cells within both ageing and fibrotic lungs. Senescent cells expressing csV1B2 show an age-independent transcriptional signature associated with DNA repair and resistance to apoptosis. Consistent with this, we show that csV1B2 expression correlates with senescent cell resistance to ABT-737-induced apoptosis in culture. Our study identifies a subset of senescent cells, marked by csV1B2, with a distinct signature of apoptosis resistance.

Extensive studies have shown that talin is the essential player in this process by binding to the intracellular tail of {beta} integrins. Here, we show that, while talin binding is essential for inside-out integrin activation in focal adhesions, it is dispensable in curved adhesions - a distinct adhesion architecture that is exclusively mediated by integrin v{beta}5 and selectively formed at curved membranes. Instead, a curvature-sensing protein FCHo2 binds to the HDRRE motif in the cytoplasmic tail of integrin {beta}5 (ITG{beta}5) and inside-out activates integrin v{beta}5 in curved adhesions. Intriguingly, FCHo2 does not bind to a similar motif in the homologous integrin {beta}3 tail. Through truncations and mutations, we identified a pivotal tryptophan (W) in the {beta}3 tail, which is conserved in all homologous integrin {beta} isoforms except {beta}5, where it is replaced by a tyrosine (Y766). This tyrosine substitution is crucial for integrin {beta}5s unique capability in forming curved adhesions. A Y766W mutation abolishes integrin {beta}5s capacity to form curved adhesions, without affecting its ability to form focal adhesions. Furthermore, our studies suggest that the phosphorylation state of Y766 regulates whether integrin v{beta}5 forms curved adhesions or focal adhesions, providing a cellular mechanism governing different adhesion types.

However, current in vitro experimental models inadequately capture the long-term effects of IH on human adipocytes.

Human stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells, isolated from subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsies, were embedded in Matrigel and seeded into Biofloat U-bottom 96-well plates. Using a 1:1 Matrigel-cell mixture and optimized seeding volumes (5-20 {micro}L), we established adipocyte organoids that formed within 10-12 days and remained viable with stable morphology for up to 90 days or more. Matrigel was essential for organoid integrity, while alternative matrices such as gelatin and low-melting agarose failed to support proper organoid formation. Subcutaneous preadipocyte medium with 10% FBS from ZenBio was superior to \"Advanced/F12K\" medium for adipogenic differentiation and long-term maintenance.\n\nTo model OSA-related hypoxic stress, we exposed organoids to intermittent hypoxia using a programmable hypoxia chamber. IH treatment suppressed adipogenesis, as shown by reduced lipid accumulation, downregulation of adipogenic markers (e.g., PPAR{gamma}, adiponectin, FABP4), and smaller intracellular lipid droplets. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed IH-induced structural abnormalities, including ER fragmentation, mitochondrial disruption, nuclear enlargement, and heterochromatin formation, all of which are hallmarks of cellular aging. Furthermore, IH upregulated HIF1, H2AX, and aging-associated histone methylation markers (H3K9me3, H3K79me3, H4K20me3), as well as extracellular matrix remodeling proteins such as fibronectin and LOX. Insulin signaling was also impaired, evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT.\n\nCollectively, these results establish a reliable platform for long-term human adipocyte organoid culture and demonstrate its utility in modeling IH-induced adipocyte dysfunction and aging.

Understanding kinetochore composition and organization in diverse lineages can reveal the trajectories of kinetochore evolution in eukaryotes and aid in dissecting the function of each subcomplex. Tetrahymena thermophila is a unicellular eukaryote of the phylum Ciliophora with a largely elusive kinetochore composition. Here, we leverage proximity proteomics coupled to deep homology detection approaches to identify 16 kinetochore proteins in T. thermophila, dubbed KiTTs (Kinetochore of Tetrahymena thermophila 1-16). We find that nine KiTTs (3-9 + 15-16) are cryptic orthologs of conventional kinetochore proteins that previously remained undetected due to extensive sequence divergence. Four KiTTs (10-13) are not orthologous to known subunits and therefore represent unconventional kinetochore proteins. Super-resolution imaging places three of these novel proteins (KiTT10/11/13) at the inner kinetochore, whereas the fourth (KiTT12) localizes near the MIS12 complex at the outer kinetochore. RNAi-mediated depletion of KiTT12 reduces levels of the outer kinetochore protein KiTT1NDC80 and causes chromosome segregation errors, showcasing a bona fide role at the kinetochore.

Growing evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles are released from primary cilia, and research is increasingly focused on defining the functions of these cilia-derived EVs. EVs are known to modulate the behavior of various cancer cells, and structural and functional abnormalities in primary cilia have been reported in multiple cancer types. We previously demonstrated that PANC-1 cells, a human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line, acquire enhanced primary cilia formation after surviving solitary culture conditions, and that their cilia contribute to tumor-like cell mass formation. Here, we explored part of the underlying mechanism of this phenotype by investigating the contribution of EVs released from the primary cilia of PANC-1 cells. Clonal PANC-1 generated by limiting dilution exhibited enhanced ciliogenesis and distinct ciliary morphologies compared with parental cells. These clones also released higher levels of cilia-derived EVs, including an expanded population of freely floating EVs within the culture environment. Biochemical analyses further showed that this increase was selective for primary cilia-derived EVs rather than reflecting a global rise in total EV production. Functionally, EV fractions enriched in cilia-derived EVs suppressed parental PANC-1 cell migration, altered cell morphology, and promoted cell aggregation, mimicking key behavioral traits of solitary condition-surviving PANC-1 clones.

Both reprogramming methods reduced senescence, mitochondrial ROS, and age-associated gene expression, with chemical reprogramming matching or exceeding OSKM efficacy.

Maintaining an appropriate nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio is essential across cell types for physiological function, and mechanisms of size control have been extensively studied in mononucleate cells. Much less is known about how comparable control is achieved in cells where many nuclei share a common cytoplasm. The filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii forms a branching mycelial network in which individual nuclei divide asynchronously, while the number of nuclei per cell volume (the nuclear density) is tightly controlled. How global regulation of nuclear density coexists with local cell cycle asynchrony remains unclear. We address this by combining a mathematical model of nuclear division in a growing and branching cell with live-cell microscopy. We model nuclei as a dividing population of phase oscillators within a branching cell network and parameterize the model with measurements from Ashbya cells. The model demonstrates that asynchrony is required to prevent large density fluctuations that would result from synchronous division, and that introducing a nuclear-density checkpoint to the cell cycles leads to synchrony if it is the only mechanism of density control. We find that coupling branch formation to nuclear density both stabilizes nuclear density and prevents the emergence of synchronous cycles. Our results indicate that asynchronous nuclear cycles together with density-responsive branching maintain a constant nuclear density, revealing a strategy for regulating the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio in large multinucleate cells.\n\nSignificanceMultinucleate cells appear in diverse biological contexts, from human tissues to filamentous fungi, yet many fundamental aspects of their cell biology are still unclear.

S.; Negi, M.; Manjithaya, R.", "abstract": "Xenophagy is a crucial innate subcellular defense mechanism, functioning as a selective autophagy pathway that captures intracellular pathogens within xenophagosomes for subsequent lysosomal degradation. However, many pathogens have evolved strategies to subvert this process, ensuring their intracellular replication and survival within the host cell. Despite its significance, the precise mechanisms by which intracellularly motile xenophagy cargo like Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) circumvent this selective autophagy pathway are not yet completely understood. In this study, we identify a previously unrecognized function of the secreted virulence factor listeriolysin (LLO) in orchestrating a multi-layered disruption of host autophagy-lysosomal machinery. While LLO is classically known for its role in mediating vacuolar escape, our findings reveal that it also contains a functional LIR motif which enables LLO to directly bind LC3 in the cytosol, rendering it unavailable for xenophagosome formation. Concurrently, LLO impairs lysosomal function by reducing its hydrolytic capacity and suppresses nuclear translocation of TFEB, a key transcription factor that governs autophagy and lysosome biogenesis, further compromising host degradative pathways. Using various Lm mutant strains, we show that actin-based motility is dispensable for xenophagy evasion. Instead, the intracellular persistence of Lm primarily stems from two factors: LLO-mediated LC3 binding, which diverts LC3 from its xenophagic functions, and the inhibition of TFEB nuclear translocation. Importantly, pharmacological activation of TFEB or genetic disruption of the LLO-LC3 interaction restores xenophagy and substantially reduces bacterial load. Collectively, our findings position LLO as a multifaceted virulence determinant that employs previously uncharacterized mechanisms to subvert host cell-autonomous defense. This study deepens mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of Lm and highlights LC3 and TFEB as promising therapeutic targets for host-directed therapies against intracellular infections.\n\nHighlights{blacksquare} Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) evades xenophagy independently of its host-actin polymerization ability\n{blacksquare}Listeriolysin O (LLO) impairs lysosomal degradative potential and suppresses TFEB nuclear translocation\n{blacksquare}LLO binds LC3 through its LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, effectively limiting LC3 availability for xenophagosome formation\n{blacksquare}Restoring LC3 and TFEB function enables intracellular clearance of Lm\n\n\nGraphical abstractThe graphical abstract illustrates how vacuolar ({Delta}hlyA), and cytosolic (WT and {Delta}actA) Listeria monocytogenes differentially engage with host-degradative pathways. Listeriolysin O (LLO), a critical virulence factor, is highlighted as the linchpin determining whether these bacteria get targeted for degradation or successfully evade the host response. In {Delta}hlyA strain infected cells, where LLO is absent, (1) the bacteria remain confined within the phagosome. (2 - 4) The phagosomal compartment then fuse with lysosome, to form phagolysosome that is both acidified and hydrolytically active, enabling effective bacterial degradation while sustaining autophagy flux. (5) This process coincides with nuclear translocation of the master transcription regulator, TFEB, which enhances lysosomal biogenesis and function, boosting bacterial clearance. On the other hand, both WT and {Delta}actA strains produce LLO, (1, 2) which allows them to escape from the phagosome into the host cytosol. (3) WT strain induces polymerization of host cell actin, leading to the formation of actin clouds that mature into actin tails, facilitating bacterial mobility and cell to cell spread. (4) The {Delta}actA strain, despite lacking the ability to interact with host actin, still replicates in the cytosol. LLO plays a multifaceted role in evading host defenses. (5 - 6) It limits LC3 availability for nascent xenophagosome formation by binding to LC3, reducing bacterial capture by the xenophagy machinery. (7 - 8) Furthermore, even when a few bacteria are successfully sequestered within phagosome or xenophagosome, LLO-mediated lysosomal dysfunction impair their maturation into degradative phagolysosome and xenolysosome. (9) Compounding this, LLO suppresses nuclear translocation of TFEB, thereby dampening transcriptional activation of autophagy-lysosomal pathways. Collectively, these mechanisms compromise the host degradative capacity, allowing cytosolic bacteria to replicate and evade clearance. Several unanswered questions remain regarding the structural and mechanistic aspects of the interaction of LLO with LC3. It is still unclear whether LC3 conjugation occurs on single or double membrane vesicles, and whether these vesicular structures are fully sealed. Additionally, it is not yet determined if LLO binds LC3 specifically at sites of omegasome or phagophore formation. The aggregation behavior of LLO also raises intriguing possibilities: could these aggregates play a protective role in shielding LLO from its degradation? Furthermore, it remains to be clarified whether LLO exists freely in the cytosol or is associated with specific membrane-bound compartments. Finally, the precise mechanism by which LLO interferes with TFEB nuclear translocation is another critical open question requiring further investigation.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=165 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/691302v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e6a382org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f8dcfeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@74b794org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c08912_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we establish that the structural integrity of very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA)-containing ceramides is a critical determinant of nutrient-dependent cell size modulation and TORC2 activity. Disruption of VLCFA elongation elevates Ypk1/2 pT662, consistent with increased TORC2 output, in both nutrient conditions. We further discovered that yeast mutants in VLCFA elongation (elo3{Delta}), fail to modulate their cell size in response to nutrient deprivation. To separate VLCFA elongation from ceramide production, we expressed mammalian ceramide synthases with defined acyl-chain preferences. Ceramides with C24-C26 chains (CerS3) supported near-normal nutrient-dependent size modulation, whereas production of C22-C24 ceramides (CerS2) phenocopied elongation mutants, leading to hyperactive TORC2 signaling and defective size regulation. Remarkably, cells producing C18 ceramides retained size control despite elevated TORC2 activity, revealing that basal signaling and size regulation can be uncoupled. Furthermore, we identify a distinct role for hydroxylation. While sur2{Delta} mutants exhibited size regulation defects resembling elongation mutants, they retained normal nutrient-responsive TORC2 signaling. Conversely, scs7{Delta} mutants maintained normal size regulation but displayed reduced basal TORC2 activity.

In these studies, high-resolution respirometry revealed distinct free radical signatures, and findings were compared with NV T1 relaxometry.

Here, using SFV as a model, we report that SFV nsP3 exploits G3BP for its condensation and transforms antiviral stress granules into proviral nsP3-G3BP co-condensates. The gel-like co-condensates of nsP3 and G3BP enrich and protect viral genomic RNAs from host RNase degradation and serve as viral translational hubs to promote viral replication. The mode of nsP3-RBP co-condensation is prevalent across alphaviruses, and disruption of nsP3 condensates is an efficient antiviral approach. Thus, these findings uncover a general anti-alphavirus strategy based on the conserved reliance of nsP3-RBP co-condensation.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Applied to a large multisample mouse Smart-seq2 dataset (n=142,315 cells/nuclei), SpliceVI jointly learns from both AS and GE using a partial variational autoencoder that effectively handles the sparsity and missingness of splicing data.

A.", "abstract": "Heterobifunctional proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as a powerful strategy to degrade disease-relevant proteins, enabling targeting of previously \"undruggable\" proteins. Current degrader molecules primarily target cytosolic substrates, yet nearly one-third of the proteome resides in or transits the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), including receptors, secreted factors, and biosynthetic enzymes with high therapeutic relevance. Whether ER-localized proteins can be broadly targeted for induced degradation remains an open question. To address this gap, we employed a panel of fluorescent reporter cell lines and used the dTAG chemical-genetic system to recruit cytosolic E3 ligases. While lumenal substrates segregated from the cytosol were resistant to degradation, recruitment of cytosolic ligases effectively degraded ER membrane proteins across multiple topologies and with post-translational modifications. CRISPR genetic screens revealed that the induced degradation required the expected cullin RING ligase complexes but surprisingly bypassed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery, with the exception of the AAA ATPase VCP. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that substrate ubiquitination was essential for VCP binding, and cleavage of ubiquitin chains released VCP, suggesting a model in which VCP directly extracts substrates independent of a dislocation apparatus. Extending this strategy to an endogenous substrate, we synthesized an HMGCR ERAD-TAC by linking atorvastatin to a cereblon E3 ligase recruiter and found that HMGCR degradation was likewise VCP-dependent. Together, these findings demonstrate that ER membrane proteins are generally susceptible to induced degradation via cytosolic ligase recruitment, uncovering a VCP-centered mechanism that operates independently of membrane-embedded ERAD machinery. This work establishes foundational principles for extending targeted protein degradation to the early secretory pathway.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

E.; Gilberti, V.; Zacco, E.; Tartaglia, G. G.", "abstract": "Nucleic acids, particularly RNA, exert multiple roles on protein aggregation, yet their mechanistic involvement remains poorly understood. Building on prior work demonstrating RNA-driven acceleration of protein aggregation, we now demonstrate that RNA binding markedly reshapes the structural and functional properties of alpha-synuclein (aS) fibrils, a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although monomeric aS exhibits negligible RNA-binding properties, aggregation markedly increases its RNA-binding capacity. Our kinetic analyses reveal that RNA incorporation during initial stages of aggregation alters fibril elongation dynamics and modulates surface-mediated secondary nucleation in a seed concentration-dependent manner. Spectroscopic and microscopic characterization (FTIR, micro-FTIR) demonstrate that RNA promotes the formation of structurally distinct, more compact aS fibrils with heterogeneous morphology. Exploiting the recently discovered catalytic hydrolase activity of aS fibrils, we show that direct RNA binding inhibits enzymatic function, consistent with RNA-induced conformational remodeling that limits the exposure of critical residues. Additionally, RNA binding to fibril surfaces impairs proteolytic degradation by proteinase K, suggesting RNA stabilizes fibrils against clearance mechanisms. Moreover, RNA sequencing of fibril-bound nucleic acids uncovers a preference towards uridine-rich motifs that computational docking locates within hydrophilic cavities of disease-associated fibril structures. Collectively, we identify RNA as an active co-factor that remodels structure, propagation kinetics, stability, and function of aS fibrils. We offer a mechanistic link between RNA interaction and amyloid polymorphism relevant to synucleinopathies and, in broader contexts, to amyloid-associated diseases.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Built upon the CodonTransformer BigBird architecture, ColiFormer employs self-attention mechanisms and a mathematical optimization method (the augmented Lagrangian approach) to balance multiple biological objectives simultaneously, including CAI, GC content, tRNA adaptation index (tAI), RNA stability, and minimization of negative cis-regulatory elements. Performance was evaluated on 37,053 native E. coli genes and 80 recombinant protein targets commonly used in industrial studies, and the results were compared with six established codon optimization approaches. Across all datasets, ColiFormer demonstrated significant improvements in CAI and tAI, maintained GC content within optimal ranges, and reduced the incidence of negative cis-regulatory elements, all with lower runtime costs than most alternative methods. These results, based on in silico metrics, indicate that ColiFormer consistently enhances recombinant protein expression and achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks compared to other established techniques.

Specifically, how the expression of a bursty gene is quantitatively determined by different molecular factors such as the concentration of transcription factors (TF) and architecture of the enhancers is not well understood. Here, we introduce a model based on the interplay between chromatin state and TF binding in order to describe bursting dynamics. We leverage the widespread Monod-Wyman-Changeux two-state model to predict the dependence of transcriptional bursting dynamics on TF concentration, binding affinity, and number of TF binding sites. We use the model to qualitatively reproduce the behavior of bursting dynamics observed in the C. elegans gonad.

In mouse mesenchymal stem cells, mouse adipocytes, and human fibroblasts undergoing partial reprogramming, we identified genes showing opposite expression dynamics during aging and reprogramming. This approach revealed regulators governing rejuvenation rather than developmental programs. Despite divergent overall network architectures, nine transcription factors converged as master regulators across all three systems, including Ezh2, Parp1, and Brca1. These regulators undergo coordinated reorganization during reprogramming, characterized by broader target engagement and enhanced regulatory coherence. We further demonstrated that direct perturbation of Ezh2 bidirectionally modulates transcriptomic age. Notably, overexpression of a catalytically inactive Ezh2 mutant achieved rejuvenation, suggesting mechanisms distinct from canonical H3K27me3-mediated regulation are involved in RIR.

The two modules assumed complementary roles: the actor encoded action-value differences and spatial contingencies required for selecting between actions, whereas the critic represented object values predictive of reward. Neurons across modules were selective for object, action, total, and difference values, supporting decision- and confidence-related activity.

Studies in other solid cancers report that impairment of the integrin effector pathway involving focal adhesion kinase (FAK) can promote anti-tumour immune responses. Therefore, we set out to address whether, and if so how, suppressing FAK function may influence GBM by using both tumour cell-specific FAK gene deletion and systemic delivery of a clinically relevant FAK kinase inhibitor (FAKi) VS-4718 in an orthotopic murine stem cell model of GBM. We found that treatment with the FAKi, but not tumour cell-specific FAK gene deletion, resulted in GBM clearance and improved survival. This was dependent on adaptive immunity, and tumour-infiltrating T cells in FAKi-treated tumours displayed increased cytotoxic potential and reduced exhaustion. We also found a significant reduction in immuno-suppressive peripherally-derived macrophages and FAKi treatment caused sequestration of inflammatory monocytes within the bone marrow, resulting in impaired monocyte trafficking to tumours as judged by adoptive transfer. This is due to suppression of key adhesion and migration signalling through 4{beta}1 integrin and CX3CR1 in peripheral monocytes. Our work here describes a previously unidentified role for FAK in trafficking of peripheral suppressive macrophages to GBM tumours, reducing T cell exhaustion and promoting anti-tumour immunity. This highlights a new way in which systemic FAK inhibitors can be used to provide a beneficial immune modulatory strategy for the treatment of GBM.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Our study revealed the pivotal role of tumor proliferation rate in driving necrosis and tissue heterogeneity and the dominant impact of oxygen consumption rate on vascularization level.

Here, we investigated the efficacy of first-in-class CB2-specific antibody agonists (AB110 and AB120) and an isotype control (AB100) on mechanical and cold hypersensitivity induced by paclitaxel in both tumor-free and mammary (4T1) tumor-bearing female mice.

Paclitaxel produced behavioral hypersensitivities to mechanical and cold stimulation, which were reduced by AB110 and AB120 for approximately 48 hours post-injection in female mice. Repeated daily dosing did not lead to tolerance to the anti-allodynic effects. Prophylactic treatment with AB110 and AB120 during paclitaxel treatment delayed, but did not prevent, the development of paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivities after termination of dosing with antibody agonists.

Conventional markers, such as serum transaminases and histopathological scoring, suffer from limited temporal resolution, high variability, and observer dependence. We evaluated immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding as a quantitative and spatially resolved marker of hepatocyte death in acute and chronic liver injury models. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 intoxication (1600 mg/kg, single dose), dose escalation (0 to 800 mg/kg), and chronic injury paradigms including Western diet (WD), WD+CCl4, and Mdr2KO mice with or without a single CCl4 challenge. The serum ALT and AST levels were measured. Liver sections were stained with IgG, Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), glutamine synthetase (GS), CD26, and alpha smooth muscle actin (Acta2). Spatial and integrative transcriptomic analyses were performed to characterize the IgG+ hepatocyte dead regions. Results: Hepatocellular IgG labeling emerged as early as 6h post CCl4 peaked at 72 to 96h, and declined during regeneration. IgG positive areas correlated strongly with Ishak necroinflammatory score (r=0.70) and serum transaminase levels (p=0.74-0.85), surpassing both in Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses (AUC=0.92-0.95). IgG bound to both apoptotic (TUNEL+) and necrotic (TUNEL-) hepatocytes. In chronic liver injury models, IgG deposition was localized to the injury zones and correlated with ALT/AST, irrespective of etiology. Multiplex imaging revealed IgG positive necrotic cores surrounded by proliferating hepatocytes and Acta2positive myofibroblasts.

S.; Killiany, S.; Yue, Z.; Sehgal, A.", "abstract": "Sleep is increasingly linked to the regulation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms underlying this interaction are underexplored. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to report a bidirectional relationship between sleep and peroxisomes, cellular organelles that process lipids and alleviate ROS. Of the genes that change expression after sleep deprivation in the dorsal fan-shaped body, knockdown of the peroxisomal biogenesis factor Pex16 results in decreased sleep. Pex16 acts in several brain regions to modulate sleep amount, with ellipsoid body neurons (EB) producing the highest sleep reduction of the sleep-promoting regions. Consistent with a general role for peroxisomes, knockdown of other peroxisomal enzymes relevant for lipid import and synthesis also decreases sleep. Whole-brain peroxisomal numbers increase with wake, which is supported by lipidomic analysis indicating that peroxisomal-derived phospholipids are the major contributors to phospholipid changes after wake or sleep deprivation. Peroxisomal proliferation in the EB is driven by neuronal activity and increased oxidation, suggesting that these mediate the effect of wake/sleep loss. In turn, peroxisomes alleviate the oxidation accumulated during wake, such that loss of Pex16 in the EB works non-cell autonomously to increase lipid peroxidation brain-wide. This likely contributes to sleep loss, as sleep is rescued with an antioxidant. Together, these results position peroxisomes as key players in sleep, regulating ROS and thereby maintaining normal cycles.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

However, RNA-seq data is sensitive to batch effects introduced by technical variation. Harmonizing expression (or batch-correcting) is critical when analyzing measurements from different RNA-seq platforms. In the context of oncology, efficiently and accurately harmonizing expression at scale is important for harnessing massively large datasets (hundreds of thousands of samples) of tumor molecular profiles from different assay platforms. We aimed to develop a method for harmonizing expression in this challenging context.\n\nResultsHere, we extend the widely used ComBat-seq method, as implemented in the pyComBat tool, to enable three key advances: (i) directionally adjusting counts from one batch towards a reference batch, rather than an average expression profile, (ii) separating the training and adjusting steps so that newly profiled samples not available at the time of initial model training can be harmonized, and (iii) flexibly handling outliers to improve the quality of harmonized counts. The resulting model correctly learns gene-specific differences between assay platforms and can near-instantaneously harmonize individual samples. We validated the use of the Caris-ComBat-seq tool to harmonize RNA-seq measurements on a benchmarking dataset of [~]10,000 TCGA tumor samples. Finally, we demonstrated its strength for very large datasets, by harmonizing RNA-seq data from nearly half a million tumor samples profiled by two different next-generation sequencing assays in Caris Life Sciences clinical laboratory.

We present WAD (Wavelet-based Accessible chromatin Deconvolution), a principled framework for robust estimation of cell type composition of bulk accessible chromatin data such as from the ATAC-seq assay.

Accurately forecasting microbial population dynamics under clinical perturbations, such as antibiotic administration, could inform treatment strategies that reduce the risk of infection. However, traditional models like the Generalized Lotka-Volterra (gLV), which consider only pairwise interactions of constant sign and magnitude, are limited in their ability to capture the real-world nonlinear dynamics of multispecies microbiomes following ecosystem disturbances. Here, we introduce a perturbation-augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (pNODE) framework that flexibly models microbial population dynamics in continuous time, integrating both microbial abundances and time-resolved antibiotic perturbations. Using both synthetic and real clinical data from over 1,000 allo-HCT patients, we demonstrate that pNODEs outperform gLV in predictive accuracy, robustness to noise, and the ability to forecast critical events, such as the intestinal expansion of an opportunistic pathogen. Notably, we demonstrate that running a pre-trained pNODE in generative mode to simulate prospective Bacilli abundance trajectories from an initial sample and antibiotic timeline yields scores that accurately predict subsequent Enterococcus infections in held-out cohorts, outperforming baseline and ground-truth-based predictors. Because pNODEs are purely data-driven dynamical systems, they can generate artifacts, such as small negative abundance values, when run in generative mode; nevertheless, our results show that these artifacts do not impair the model's ability to encode clinically relevant ecological structure and may even enhance it.

A.; Li, M.; Zhao, N.", "abstract": "Background: Differential abundance analysis is fundamental to microbiome research and provides valuable insights into host-microbe interactions. However, microbiome data are compositional, highly sparse (with many zero counts), and influenced by differential experimental biases across taxa. Standard statistical methods often overlook these features. Many approaches analyze relative abundances without accounting for compositionality or rely on pseudocounts, potentially leading to spurious associations and inadequate false discovery rate (FDR) control. Methods: We introduce a novel framework for differential abundance analysis of microbiome data: the Compositional Accelerated Failure Time (CAFT) model. CAFT addresses zero read counts by treating them as censored observations that are below a detection limit. This approach is inherently resistant to multiplicative technical bias, eliminates the need for pseudocounts, and addresses compositional bias through the establishment of appropriate score test procedures. Results: Extensive simulations show that CAFT outperforms competing compositional differential abundance methods, including LOCOM, LinDA, ANCOM-BC2, its robust variant, and LDM-clr by offering more robust type I error and FDR control with or without technical bias. Additionally, we applied CAFT to microbiome data on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the upper respiratory tract (URT) to identify differentially abundant gut microbial taxa between IBD patients and healthy controls, as well as URT taxa distinguishing smokers from non-smokers. Conclusion: We present CAFT, a powerful, robust, and efficient approach for compositional differential abundance analysis. CAFT effectively controls Type I error and maintains FDR control, while demonstrating enhanced power in statistical testing.

We develop a semiparametric (double machine learning) one-step estimator that more accurately estimates the MAPA and yields valid confidence intervals across flexible machine learning settings. Analyzing data from the Reproducible Brain Charts dataset, we show that this estimator has smaller bias when estimating brain-phenotype associations of neuroimaging data with age and psychopathology phenotypes.

Several computational methods have been developed for identifying cell-type-specific spatially variable genes (ctSVGs), but their relative performance and practical utility under realistic biological complexity remain largely unknown. To address this gap, we present the first systematic benchmark study of all five existing ctSVG detection methods---CELINA, STANCE, C-SIDE, CTSV and spVC---using an integrated evaluation framework that combines idealized simulations, Xenium-based realistic simulations, and a decomposition-based diagnostic analysis. We compared the methods in terms of detection accuracy, scalability, and usability. Across realistic datasets generated on various tissue types, all methods experienced sharp declines in detection accuracy and substantial inflation of false discoveries compared to idealized simulations. To explain this failure, we developed a new simulation framework that decomposes the ''realness'' of the realistic simulation into interpretable biological and technical components, enabling us to attribute method-specific performance losses to specific components, including realistic diversity of cell types, heterogeneous cell layouts, null gene distributions, capture efficiency and realistic intra-cell-type spatial patterns. Together, our results show that no single method dominates across detection accuracy, scalability and usability, and we further clarify why current ctSVG methods fall short in realistic settings.

Using RNA-sequencing, we find that microglia from global Gpr34 knockout (KO) mouse brains exhibited transcriptional shifts toward disease-associated microglia (DAM) and inflammatory profiles, partially mirroring the microglial phenotype seen in 5xFAD AD model mice.

Intake of caffeine simultaneously with alcohol consumption may increase the risk of alcohol abuse and dependence. Adenosinergic pathways are protective, and caffeine has a non-selective antagonistic role on adenosinergic receptors.

MicroRNAs play a significant role in cellular and physiological functions and can be altered by consuming ethanol and other substances associated with the modulation of the inflammatory response. This study aimed to identify changes in the expression of microRNAs involved in inflammatory processes and adenosinergic pathways in the prostate, resulting from the interaction between ethanol and caffeine.

We found different timescales of activation between VTA-NAc and VTA-PFC during conditioned place preference that support distinct aspects of fentanyl-context association. Together, our data demonstrate that based on projection target alone, VTA neurons can undergo vastly different adaptations in response to fentanyl, providing new insight into VTA encoding of opioid behaviors.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Developing animal models that replicate PD neuropathological phenotypes is critical for understanding its pathophysiology and evaluating potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we show that direct unilateral injection of human Synuclein PFFs into the Substantia Nigra (SN) of mutant A53T alpha-synuclein overexpressing mice induce bilateral phosphorylated alpha-Synuclein (pS129) pathology in the SN. This pathology spreads to the striatum, cerebral cortex, and midbrain within 60 days and is accompanied by neuroinflammation in the midbrain and cerebral cortex. Additionally, we observed synuclein-dependent neurodegeneration, with a 50% reduction in Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) intensity in the SN and a 40% reduction in Striatum, both bilaterally. The model also revealed a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) and T-cell infiltration in the PFF injected animals, correlating with pS129 pathology and neuroinflammation. Taken together, we developed a mouse model that recapitulates multiple PD phenotypes, providing a valuable platform for testing therapeutic strategies targeting human alpha-Synuclein pathology and for exploring CNS-peripheral immune interactions in PD.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Although amygdala atrophy is early evidenced in Alzheimers Disease (AD), the molecular mechanisms disrupted in initial neuropathological stages are still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the proteomic impairment of the amygdaloid region from AD-Braak stage I-II and III-IV subjects to better understand the neuropathological processes occurred early in this area and to identify potential targets that may face AD from the beginning of the disease. Methods: Label-free quantitative proteomics was applied using an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass-spectrometer in 24 postmortem amygdala specimens derived from non-demented (n=3F/5M), AD-Braak stage I-II (n=4F/4M) and AD-Braak stage III-IV (n=4F/4M). Data analysis was performed using MaxQuant and Perseus software (two-way Student T-test; p<0.05). Metascape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis softwares were considered for biological interpretation. Connectivity map platform was used for drug repurposing analyses. Transcriptomic/proteomic data of other brain regions were obtained from AlzData, Neuropro, and Agora repositories. Results: Amygdaloid proteome of AD-Braak stage I-II and III-IV subjects compared to controls revealed a progressive proteomic impairment with a minimal overlap across Braak stages. Some of the amygdaloid DEPs were known interactors of human A{beta} plaques, APP, or Tau proteins or were previously identified at transcriptional or translational level in other brain regions affected by AD. Interestingly, amygdaloid proteome was more severely affected in women than in men with a particular protein expression profile associated to each AD stage. Comparing our sex-dependent differential proteome datasets with transcriptomic data of different brain regions, we identified potential sex-specific proteins related to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Finally, data-driven drug repositioning using amygdaloid omics profiles unveiled that most of the small molecule candidates were neuropathological stage and/or sex-specific. Conclusions: Early and sex-specific amygdaloid proteome dysregulation in AD highlights the consideration of a deliberate stratification by sex in future research and clinical trials to develop effective therapeutic strategies in AD for both sexes.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Aging, the progressive decline in physiological function and cellular resilience over time, is a central process contributing to sex-specific life histories, yet the mechanisms driving sex differences in aging remain largely unresolved. Long-term mark-recapture efforts revealed a striking pattern of female-biased longevity in the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination. As a result, this species provides a compelling system to examine the mechanisms of sex-specific aging in the absence of sex chromosomes. Here, we characterize sex- and age-associated patterns in the blood transcriptomes of wild painted turtles (n = 93). We identified widespread gene expression differences between females and males (2,347 genes; 13.4% of all filtered genes). In contrast, only six genes showed significant linear relationships with continuous age in both sexes. We also employed a machine learning approach which identified distinct sets of genes for which expression was predictive of age in each sex. Age-related gene expression patterns highlight both conserved molecular pathways with known roles in aging as well as novel gene targets. These findings suggest sex-specific molecular processes underlie sex-biased demographic aging and raise questions regarding the environmental and developmental drivers of sex-biased gene expression.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

We combined global-scale molecular phylogenetics with chromosome-level genome assemblies to resolve this taxonomic issue. Using mitochondrial and nuclear markers from 287 specimens across five ocean regions, including type localities in Bora Bora (T. coccinea) and Galapagos (T. tagusensis), we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships and inferred demographic history through approximate Bayesian computation. We also generated high-quality, chromosome-level genome assemblies for three morphologically distinct morphotypes from the Brazilian coastline. Phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses revealed two well-supported clades: a small, geographically restricted T. tagusensis clade confined to the Galapagos Islands, and a large cosmopolitan clade containing all worldwide samples, including T. coccinea from its type locality. Platinum grade Genomic analyses confirmed that the three morphotypes represent a single species, sharing a triploid karyotype of 14 chromosomes with extensive synteny and gene-tree discordance consistent with incomplete lineage sorting. Spread-route analyses identified the Centralwestern Pacific as the ancestral source, with at least three independent, human-mediated colonization events establishing populations in the Southwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Western Pacific. Our results definitively establish Tubastraea coccinea as the cosmopolitan species responsible for global dissemination, while T. tagusensis is endemic to the Galapagos and not involved in the worldwide spread.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

The common marmoset, a small-bodied New World monkey and emerging model of social and visual neuroscience, relies heavily on rapid head movements in addition to eye movements to orient (Pandey et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2025). Previous studies have found a relatively restricted oculomotor range extending out about 10 visual degrees from the central position of rest (Mitchell et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2025). However, previous studies have either used empty arenas for exploration (Singh et al., 2025), or in head-fixed animals used exploration of images potentially biased centrally with posed stimuli (Mitchell et al., 2014). This leaves open questions about whether this restricted oculomotor range is due to physical constraints or a lack of attention-drawing stimuli in the periphery. Understanding marmosets' oculomotor range is important for applying modern methods that use marker-less pose tracking of the head as a proxy for gaze direction, under the assumption eye gaze is relatively restricted and can be ignored (Meisner et al., 2025). Using high-precision eye tracking and free-viewing of a natural image and video with objects of interest placed in the periphery, we quantified the oculomotor range of head-fixed marmosets.

We present Deep learning-based Chromatin Accessibility SNP Targeting for GWAS (DeepCAST-GWAS), a framework that integrates functional annotations derived from deep learning models to improve both the yield and the reliability of GWAS findings. DeepCAST-GWAS uses SNP Activity Difference (SAD) scores from in silico mutagenesis with the Enformer model to estimate the predicted effect of each variant on chromatin accessibility across tissues, allowing statistical testing to focus on variants with stronger regulatory evidence. Using conservative family-wise error rate (FWER) control, DeepCAST-FWER produces fewer associations than existing power-boosting approaches, but the associations it reports replicate in larger cohort GWAS at substantially higher rates. For applications where discovery count is more important, DeepCAST-sFDR increases the number of genome-wide significant findings above baseline GWAS by using the Enformer SAD scores for stratified False Discovery Rate (sFDR) control. DeepCAST-sFDR achieves performance comparable to the strongest competing method, while maintaining reliability on par with a standard GWAS.

Previous studies have mainly focused on exclusion scenarios driven by genetic mechanisms, whereas few have explored the impact of competitive interactions among parent species and their hybrids on generating multiple coexistence regimes. Here, we develop a population dynamics model that explicitly couples hybridization genetics with population dynamics driven by competitive interactions among two parent species and their hybrids. Our analysis reveals that backcrossing can fundamentally reshape coexistence regimes, generating five alternative outcomes: (i) alternative stable states of coexistence of both parent species and hybrids, (ii) frequency-independent coexistence, (iii) frequency-dependent coexistence, (iv) competitive exclusion of a rarer species, and (v) extinction of all populations. These outcomes arise from the balance between two key processes: regeneration of parental genotypes through hybrid x hybrid mating and competitive exclusion mediated by hybrids. Thus, hybridization can generate multiple stable coexistence regimes even when species would otherwise be excluded. This eco-genetic mechanism provides a unifying theoretical basis for predicting the ecological consequences of hybridization, highlighting the crucial role of competitive interactions in determining coexistence outcomes.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Using a panel of 198 soybean accessions grown under well-watered and drought conditions, we first evaluated four direction-specific prediction models (genome[-&gt;]microbiome, genome[-&gt;]metabolome, metabolome[-&gt;]microbiome, and microbiome[-&gt;]metabolome) to estimate the predictability of individual omics features. Then, we evaluated whether subsets of features with high cross-omics predictability improve phenotype prediction. These cross-layer models identify features that play physiologically meaningful roles within multi-omics systems, enabling us to prioritize variables that capture coherent biological signals enriched for phenotype-relevant information. As a result, metabolome features were highly predictable from microbiome data, whereas microbiome predictability from metabolomic data was weaker and more environment-dependent, revealing an asymmetric relationship between these layers. In the subsequent phenotype prediction analysis, the model incorporating predictability-based feature selection substantially outperformed models using randomly selected features and also achieved prediction accuracies comparable to those of the full-feature model. Under drought, phenotype prediction models based on metabolomic or microbiomic kernels (MetBLUP or MicroBLUP) outperformed the genomic baseline (GBLUP) for several biomass-related traits, indicating that environment-responsive omics layers captured phenotypic variation not explained by additive genetic effects.

A central challenge in modern GPCR drug discovery is understanding and exploiting biased agonism: the ability of ligands to favor signaling via therapeutically beneficial pathways while avoiding those that trigger side effects. Therefore, pinpointing the structural determinants of signaling bias is crucial for rational drug design. Biased agonists are particularly compelling for targeting opioid receptors, as in this family, ligands that limit B-arrestin (B-arr) recruitment are believed to preserve analgesia while reducing respiratory depression and addiction liabilities. Here, we use extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to dissect signaling bias in the d-opioid receptor (dOR). Focusing on a receptor mutant with a strong B-arr bias, we employed a reverse-engineering approach to reveal the conformational mechanisms that promote B-arr recruitment. Building on these insights, engineer new mutations that reshape the receptor signaling profile. Importantly, this approach allowed us to pinpoint signaling bias to motions of a single microswitch and identify how structural receptor motions induced by the mutations and ligand contacts cooperate to promote a specific functional response. In this proof-of-concept study, we not only provide structural insights into dOR pharmacology but also demonstrate how computational methods can be leveraged to probe structural mechanisms of signaling specificity across GPCRs, paving the way for the rational design of tailored receptor variants and novel, safer, and more effective therapeutics.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Our approach simplifies complex catalytic mechanisms into interpretable geometric filters comprising critical inter-atomic distances and accessibility of atomic pairs parameters.

The filters demonstrated robust performance across chemically diverse substrates. On testing datasets, the derived filters achieved average accuracy of 77% and sensitivity of 94% for haloalkane dehalogenases and average 57% recall of true substrates for aldehyde reductases, exceeding state-of-the-art machine learning methods for substrate predictions on these datasets.

To investigate how dietary lipids shape the initiation and progression of Kras-driven neoplasia, we examined the effects of low-fat diet (LFD), high-fat diet (HFD), and KD in the Ptf1aCreERT2;KrasG12V (AcinarKrasG12V) mouse model. KD fed mice showed the shortest survival (median 26 days) compared with SD (87 days; p = 0.02) and LFD (57 days; p = 0.02), while HFD fed mice also exhibited reduced survival relative to SD (35 days; p = 0.05). KD feeding induced severe glucose intolerance and elevated circulating B-hydroxybutyrate levels. Histologically, KD fed AcinarKrasG12V mice developed invasive, sarcomatoid-like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), while HFD fed mice showed increased poorly differentiated PDAC; in both groups these aggressive tumors were associated with extensive fibrosis and increased stromal CD39 expression relative to tumor compartments. Proteomic analysis demonstrated activation of PI3K, Akt, mTOR and EGFR signaling in KD and HFD-fed AcinarKrasG12V mice.

Although statin intolerance due to statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) has been a clinically important issue for decades, the molecular mechanisms of statin myopathy remain incompletely understood. To seek to clarify how statins induce myopathy, here we perform transcriptome analysis and identify FAM134B short isoform (FAM134B-S), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy receptor, as a statin-inducible gene. FAM134B-S expression is regulated by the mevalonate pathway and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins. We further show that FAM134B plays a critical role in the regulation of skeletal muscle integrity both in the steady-state and statin-treated conditions in human iPS cell-derived myocytes and mice. Mechanistically, FAM134B-S interacts with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium pump SERCA1 and promotes its autophagic degradation.

To remedy this situation we propose an encoding method based on a Bayesian Multivariate Linear model which is ideally suited to the factorial analysis of such data. We show how it can be used to test for multivariate main effects and interactions using data from EEG studies of Reward Learning and Declarative Memory. This approach additionally allows for null hypotheses to be accepted and allows one to infer whether multivariate effects are driven by collections of univariate effects or voxel dependencies.

In this study, we analysed plasma-derived A{beta}42-containing EVs from participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and calculated the ratio between the percentage of A{beta}42-positive peripheral EVs and CSF A{beta}42 (rA{beta}42).

Longitudinal analyses revealed that higher rA{beta}42 values predicted accelerated hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline, independent of CSF A{beta}42 concentrations.

Recent theoretical work suggest that shared noise along the stimulus encoding direction is the primary factor that limits information encoding (i.e., information-limiting noise). Despite this theoretical insight, it has been difficult to test experimentally due to the challenges in inferring information-limiting noise from neural data. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a method (i.e., split-trial analysis) based on partitioning the neural population response of an individual trial. Results from extensive numerical simulations suggest that split-trial analysis substantially outperforms existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Notably, it does so without estimating the noise covariance matrix, which represents a major barrier for prior studies. Applications of split-trial analysis to a number of neurophysiological datasets reveals insights into the precision of the neural codes for several systems. First, it reveals a substantial amount of information-limiting noise in the head direction system in mice. Second, it suggests a small yet positive information-limiting noise in the orientation code in mouse V1. Third, it reveals that the information-limiting noise in the macaque prefrontal cortex is highly consistent over time during a simple saccade task. Split-trial analysis is a general technique that should be widely applicable in analyzing the properties of population codes in the brain.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

While our previous study showed that AD+P is associated with loss of prefrontal cortex postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins, identifying proteins in the broader cellular environment that influence PSD loss addresses a critical knowledge gap about synaptic dysfunction mechanisms in early disease stages. Study Design: We conducted a proteomic analysis comparing prefrontal grey matter cortex tissue homogenates from elderly normal controls (n=18), individuals with AD+P (n=61), and individuals with AD-P (n=48), all with Braak stages 3-5. Study Results: AD+P showed the most pronounced alterations relative to controls (178 proteins with q<0.05), although alterations in AD-P and AD+P relative to controls were highly similar (R2=0.965, p<0.001). Weighted-gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified four modules significantly associated with disease status, comparing AD subjects to controls, but none differed significantly between AD+P and AD-P. We identified 15 proteins significantly correlated with PSD yield across all samples, including ENPP6, linked to AD+P by GWAS. Additionally, PSD yield-associated proteins showed minimal overlap with altered AD proteins (1 of 137). WGCNA revealed one module significantly correlated with PSD yield across all samples, enriched for inflammatory terms. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a model in which AD+P arises from the combination of quantitative alterations within a shared AD proteome profile and a superimposed set of protein alterations correlated with PSD yield that are largely independent of the shared AD proteome, conferring distinct mechanisms of synaptic vulnerability and psychosis risk.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Although these substates are well characterized in adults, their developmental trajectory remains unclear. Here, we examined the development of tonic and phasic REM in rats from postnatal day (P) 12-24, spanning a period of rapid corticothalamic development. We recorded local field potentials and single units from primary motor cortex (M1), together with high-speed video and electromyographic recordings of the nuchal muscle. Periods of behavioral quiescence along with high delta power indicated NREM sleep, whereas periods of sustained muscle atonia and low delta power indicated REM sleep. At P16, M1 theta oscillations first appeared, and the delay to the first twitch increased, revealing the start of a distinct twitch-free portion of REM sleep. Motivated by this, we divided REM sleep into phasic and tonic periods, with and without twitching, respectively. Spiking activity and gamma power were consistently higher during phasic REM. At P20, phasic REM also showed faster theta oscillations than tonic REM. At P24, tonic REM was accompanied by a distinct alpha oscillation. These results show that the features distinguishing the two REM substates appear sequentially across development, revealing a progressive differentiation of REM sleep into tonic and phasic periods, a developmental refinement that may support increasingly complex forms of sleep-dependent plasticity.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Using single-cell transcriptomics with histological validation, we generated a spatiotemporal atlas of serotonin and serotonin-related genes in the human gut from first trimester to late adulthood. The serotonin synthesis gene, TPH1, was exclusively expressed in enteroendocrine cells at all time points analyzed, with the highest expression in the second trimester. The serotonin reuptake gene, SLC6A4, was largely restricted to mature absorptive enterocytes and increased post-natally. Serotonin receptors also displayed distinct cellular and developmental expression patterns. HTR1E was confined to the first trimester during highly proliferative stage. HTR4 was enriched for in crypt regions, suggesting a role in proliferation for serotonin. Finally, HTR3E was associated with tuft cells throughout development.

This plant, although having demonstrated strong invasive potential, still largely remains unrecognised as a taxon of concern in Mediterranean countries, at least in national official catalogues. In this study, we assess the impact of this hybrid on coastal communities, focusing on the European Union Habitat of Community Interest (HCI) 1240--''vegetated cliffs with endemic statices (Limonium spp.)''--at two sites along the southern coast of Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula). Between 2022 and 2025, we conducted field surveys to document the population size, growth stages, and spatial competition with native species. Additionally, we gathered 1,422 iNaturalist occurrences of K. xhoughtonii to map its distribution across the Mediterranean Basin, assess its presence within Natura 2000 protected sites and within protected areas, including the HCI 1240, and determine its potential spread using ensemble ecological niche modelling with bioclimatic variables. Our results show that K. xhoughtonii forms dense monospecific patches in the surveyed areas that compete for space with two native Limonium species in southern Catalonia. Moreover, we confirmed 713 naturalised occurrences in the Mediterranean area, 107 were located within Natura 2000 protected sites and 58 within the HCI 1240 included in protected sites. Ecological niche modelling indicates high climatic suitability across 93% of western and 59% of eastern Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites containing the HCI 1240.

However, the mutational processes that efficiently modify gene regulatory elements and the target genes upon which they act are poorly understood. We investigated the regulatory function and origins of the fastest evolved regions in the human genome, termed Human Ancestor Quickly Evolved Regions (HAQERs), in their native genomic context during human cerebral cortex development. Results: We identified 50 HAQERs with accessible chromatin in developing human cortex, largely arising from previously unconstrained ancestral sequences. To test the necessity of these HAQERs for gene regulation, we established an all-in-one CRISPRi lentiviral vector and linked 26 HAQERs to nearby target genes across cell types and Wnt pathway activation contexts. Rapid gains of CpGs distinguished HAQERs active during cortical development and displaying human-specific epigenomic marks. As a high density of CpG sites can drive formation of permissive chromatin, we identified 107 HAQERs with at least 17 human-specific CpG gains per kb, termed HAQER CpG Beacons. These HAQERs emerged via contributions from GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) with evidence for selection preferentially fixing CpG sites. Notably, the CHL1 and DPP10 loci, both implicated in human neurological disorders, each harbored two gene-linked HAQER CpG Beacons. Conclusions: Our findings reveal HAQER target genes and support a model where gBGC and natural selection jointly drive regulatory-altering CpG variants to fixation, forging regulatory innovations in the human cortex.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

CXCL5/CXCR2 signaling has recently been shown to promote breast cancer colonization to the bone. Here, we investigate the effects of osteoblasts and osteocytes on breast cancer cell proliferation in engineered two- and three-dimensional models. We observed that osteoblasts and osteocytes induce proliferative effects on cancer cells. Specifically, bone cells increase cancer proliferation in 2D culture and osteoblasts increase cancer growth more than osteocytes in 3D models. Moreover, osteocyte interaction with cancer cells in 3D models are stiffness dependent. We show that these effects depend on the CXCL5/CXCR2 signaling axis.

Results: Here, we present a comprehensive, multi-genome benchmark for simple and complex inversions derived from Strand-seq and phased long-read based assemblies across five reference samples, with breakpoint refinement using haplotype-resolved long-read assemblies. This tiered resource spans a broad spectrum of inversion classes, sizes, and zygosity states, and captures challenging genomic contexts including segmental duplications, inverted repeats, and composite rearrangements. We used this benchmark to systematically assess leading structural variant callers and alignment strategies across short-read, PacBio HiFi, and Oxford Nanopore data. Performance varied substantially by inversion class and genomic context: simple inversions were recovered with high sensitivity at sufficient coverage, whereas complex and heterozygous events remained difficult. Sniffles2 and Severus achieved the strongest recall for complex inversions, despite increased false-positive rates. We additionally benchmarked two commonly used long-read alignment pipelines (Minimap2 and VACmap), demonstrating that the mapper choice has a substantial impact on inversion detection in repetitive regions.

Both barcodes and UMIs may contain errors from production, amplification or sequencing. Correcting and resolving such errors before further processing yields more reliable data and more accurate expression measurements.

However, the mechanistic basis of VRs effects on human motor systems, especially the impact of emotionally charged VR experiences on segmental spinal reflex excitability, remains unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of immersive VR stimulation with different emotional tones, the Jendrassik maneuver, and transcranial magnetic stimulation on spinal motor center excitability in healthy adults. H-reflex and M-response amplitudes in the soleus muscle were measured during tibial nerve stimulation under control conditions, during the Jendrassik maneuver, subthreshold magnetic stimulation, and while participants viewed VR videos evoking fear, excitement, or relaxation.

The principal finding was that emotionally salient VR content, particularly scenes inducing fear, produced clear lateralized effects on the spinal motor system. Specifically, inhibitory effects on reflex excitability were observed in the dominant limb, while facilitatory changes occurred in the non-dominant limb. These patterns suggest that immersive VR may differentially engage descending modulatory systems, influencing both sympathoadrenal and corticospinal pathways. In contrast, traditional neuromodulatory interventions did not alter reflex parameters compared to control. The results highlight the unique multimodal influence of immersive VR on sensorimotor regulation and support its incorporation into advanced neurorehabilitation protocols.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

However, the effect of LBBA pacing on changes in left ventricular (LV) function in paired experiments on healthy hearts, particularly in relation to myocardial strain and time-to-peak systolic strain difference (TPSD), which are critical indicators of LV dysfunction, remains inadequately understood. Objective: To investigate how the LV myocardial strain and TPSD change in a comparative study of LBBA pacing versus conventional RV apex pacing in the same hearts under normal physiological conditions. Methods: Pre-clinical canine models (n=7) were implanted with pacing leads in the LBBA and RV apex. Functional parameters were assessed under acute pacing conditions and during sinus rhythm (SR) with echocardiographic assessment. Results: Results demonstrated that LBBA pacing significantly improved global longitudinal strain (GLS: -13{+/-}2% vs. -9{+/-}2%, p = 0.0003) and global circumferential strain (GCS: -16{+/-}3% vs. -10{+/-}4%, p = 0.0119) compared to RV apical pacing. TPSD was significantly greater with RV pacing (65{+/-}10 ms vs. 24{+/-}7 ms, p = 0.0024). Compared with SR data, LBBA pacing showed no significant changes in GLS, GCS, or TPSD. Conclusion: These findings suggest that LBBA pacing effectively preserves global myocardial strain and TPSD close to their values in SR, thereby contributing to enhanced overall LV function, as evidenced by improvements in ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and end-diastolic volume.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

At the larval stage, it is characterized by posterior-lateral caudal filaments, which vary markedly in length within the same samples in Bolivia, with some individuals displaying unusually long filaments. The coexistence of individuals with relatively long and relatively short filaments raises the question of whether at least two distinct populations could be differentiated based on caudal filament length. This study examined filament-length distributions in two Bolivian dry-valley populations, El Chaco and Mataral, to determine whether variation reflects distinct subpopulations or continuous phenotypic variation within a single population. Distributions deviated from normality, exhibiting moderate skewness and tail heaviness, and the Generalized Error Distribution provided the best statistical fit. Examination of outliers and a targeted analysis of the distribution tail using multiple complementary methods showed that extreme values did not form a discrete secondary cluster but rather represented the upper continuum of the trait range. The two sites showed broadly comparable distributions, consistent with similar environmental conditions. These results emphasize the importance of using appropriate distributional models for continuous traits, highlight the occurrence of rare extreme phenotypes within otherwise homogeneous populations, and provide a baseline for future studies on the ecological and genetic determinants of caudal filament variation in An. pseudopunctipennis.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Community-wide data science competitions such as TADPOLE Challenge provide platforms to benchmark predictive models using ADNI datasets. While top performing models achieve accurate predictions, they leave mechanistic questions unresolved. METHODS: We analyzed XGBoost with TreeSHAP for feature interactions and RNN with Integrated Gradients for temporal trends. This two-branch design allows XGBoost to capture nonlinear cross sectional interactions, while RNN captures evolving, time dependent influences. We conducted parallel attribution analyses across full and reduced feature sets, and then fused the outputs from both branches into a unified importance map. This fusion step prioritizes features consistently supported by both static and temporal models. RESULTS: Our framework showed agreement between TreeSHAP and IG, highlighting FAQ, CDRSB, ADAS13, MMSE, and RAVLT variants as the most consistently important features across both branches. Temporal attribution analysis revealed stage dependent trends: in CN, DX:CN, FAQ, and RAVLT_immediate increased in importance; in MCI, MidTemp and WholeBrain gained importance; and in AD, FAQ remained dominant. Feature interaction analysis identified strong clinical-clinical interactions and secondary clinical-molecular interactions. Notably, FAQ and CDRSB repeatedly formed high-strength interaction pairs, while hippocampal and entorhinal volumes contributed secondary molecular modulation, revealing distinct clusters of jointly influential biomarkers. DISCUSSION: This work highlights feature interactions and temporal trends in AD prediction models, offering insights for personalized treatments and patient specific trial designs. Our framework provides stable, cross validated explanations that unify structural and temporal importance, enhancing trustworthiness and mechanistic interpretability in AD modeling.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Coronary endothelial dysfunction, a sensitive marker of early vascular injury and a potential target for intervention is common in this population, but its biological basis remains unknown. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study combining in vivo coronary MRI and high-throughput serum proteomics to investigate mechanisms of coronary endothelial dysfunction in treated HIV. Forty-five virally suppressed PWH and twenty-nine age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent coronary MRI during isometric handgrip exercise to quantify coronary endothelial function, defined as the percentage change in coronary cross-sectional area (%CSA) from rest to stress. An increase in coronary CSA <2% indicated endothelial dysfunction. Parallel serum proteomic profiling was performed using the SomaScan 7K platform, and differential protein expression between groups was analyzed using linear modeling (LIMMA). Results: Coronary endothelial dysfunction was more prevalent in PWH with suppressed viral load compared to controls (67% vs 10%, p<0.001). Pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins between participants with and without endothelial dysfunction highlighted significant dysregulation of glutathione dependent detoxification, oxidative metabolism and fatty acid {beta}-oxidation pathways in individuals with endothelial dysfunction (adjusted p value <0.05).

This method was applied to detect Gb3 accumulation in heart tissue of murine models of Fabry disease, including mice deficient in alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) activity (GLA knock-out) and transgenic mice with a GLA knock-out and an upregulation of globotriaosylceramides (Gb3) synthase. With AP-MALDI MSI we were able to discern the heterogenous expression of Gb3 lipoforms with down to 5 um pixel size and reveal the significantly increased Gb3 content in mice containing a GLA knock-out combined with human Gb3 synthase overexpression compared to GLA knock-out and wild type samples. By employing Raman microscopy with a pixel size of 2 um, we were able to contextualize the physiological alterations in cardiac tissue by identifying components associated with nuclei, tissue, collagen, and lipids for the same three genotypes. An automated co-localization algorithm aligned Raman and AP-MALDI-MSI data from the same tissue section with (5.1 +- 1.6) um precision, enabling overlay at 5 um and 2 um resolution.

Here, we present an extensive field-based study of small mammals and their multiple pathogens to assess diversity-disease relationships at a local scale, revealing pathogen-specific patterns. While no significant association was detected between the prevalence of some pathogens and host diversity, others such as Orthopoxvirus and a strain of Mycoplasma haemomuris exhibited dilution effect patterns, whereas another Mycoplasma haemomuris strain and Mycoplasma coccoides displayed amplification effects.

Here, we investigated which functional species traits (scale type, schooling behaviour, and position-in-water-column) are selected for by eDNA metabarcoding and beach seines in nearshore eelgrass, mixed eelgrass, and understory kelp habitats. Using data from 35 sites across southeast Alaska, we applied occupancy modeling to estimate detection of species traits by each gear type. Detection probability with eDNA was 27 times greater for species with deciduous scales compared to species with non-deciduous scales, and lower for species with plates (rather than scales).

Given the novelty of eDNA sampling, quantifying interactions between functional traits and gear selectivity will be important to accurately characterize species distributions across marine habitats.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Although biofilm and planktonic communities may share some taxa, the extent of the overlap and the factors driving community differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput metabarcoding of 16S and 18S rRNA genes to investigate bacterial and protist communities associated with Phragmites australis stem biofilms and planktonic fractions across five lakes spanning an eutrophication gradient in the Masurian Lake District, northeastern Poland. The biofilm communities on reed stems were highly distinct from planktonic ones, sharing only a small core microbiome. The biofilm core not only exceeded that of planktonic communities but also contained characteristic taxa, identified via machine learning, that were distinct from planktonic assemblages, including several with potential roles in bioremediation and as bioindicators. Planktonic communities were strongly influenced by environmental factors, whereas Phragmites australis-associated epiphytic biofilm communities appeared more uniform across lakes, consistent with host-associated selection and potentially with lifestyle-related buffering. Moreover, biofilm suspensions exhibited higher apparent physiological activity per inoculum volume and broader substrate use under our assay conditions than the free-living communities. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the ecological significance of biofilms in freshwater systems and underscore the need to integrate both biofilm and planktonic fractions of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to fully capture microbial diversity, function, and ecosystem resilience.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

D.; Czuppon, P.", "abstract": "The number of transposable elements (TEs) per host genome varies within natural populations, with variance much greater than the mean. This pattern, known as overdispersion, conflicts with classical population genetic models based on the Poisson distribution, which predict equal mean and variance. To address this gap, we develop a stochastic model of TE dynamics using a bi-parental Moran process with recombination that explicitly accounts for core evolutionary forces: transposition, excision, and purifying selection. From this model, we derive analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the TE copy number. Our results show that overdispersion arises naturally when the transposition rate exceeds the product of the selection coefficient and the mean copy number, and that overdispersion increases with higher transposition rates. Additionally, we show that maintaining positive TE copy numbers at equilibrium, and thus sustaining overdispersion, requires a net transposition rate below approximately 0.5 insertions per copy per generation, a constraint satisfied by observed TE families to maintain genome stability. The derived overdispersion also accounts for the right-skewed, heavy-tailed distribution of copy numbers, capturing features that classical models fail to account for. A qualitative comparison of these predictions with data from 18 active TE families in 85 Drosophila melanogaster strains confirms these patterns: all active TEs in the data exhibited overdispersion, with variances 2 to 10 times the mean and the distribution showing positive, or right skewness. Collectively, our findings reveal that TE distributions deviate from Poisson expectations and establish overdispersion as an inherent feature of TE population dynamics, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding the full distributional properties of TE copy numbers.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

While the Musashi proteins are expressed in various cell types, their role in regulating splicing appears to be confined to photoreceptor cells, where the two proteins have exceptionally high expression levels. To test if the photoreceptor-specific role of MSI1 and MSI2 in splicing is due to their expression levels in photoreceptor cells, we generated combined Msi1 and Msi2 knockouts that progressively reduced the number of Musashi alleles in photoreceptor cells. We analyzed the splicing of photoreceptor-specific exons in the Cc2d2a, Cep290, Prom1, and Ttc8 genes and the function of photoreceptor cells in the knockouts.

Intrinsic or extrinsic situations that threaten organic homeostasis trigger a series of adaptive responses that constitute the stress systems, which consist of different physical and mental reactions that oppose the stressful stimulus, aiming to restore the lost balance. The UChA and UChB rat varieties constitute rare models for studies related to the genetic, biochemical, physiological, nutritional and pharmacological factors of the effects of alcohol, as well as appetite and tolerance, important factors related to human alcoholism. The present work arose from the interest in investigating the effects of stress on these animals, since several aspects of alcoholism may be the result of stress experienced early in life, being potentiated or not in the adult individual. Thus, the research proposes to investigate and evaluate whether maternal neonatal separation, applied to male offspring of UChA and UChB rats, potentiates the toxic effects of chronic alcohol intake on choroid plexus cells. Maternal separation (MS) change the ethanol consumption and not altered IGF-I expressions.

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we examined how binding of aristolochic acid in the intracellular site and cholesterol at the extracellular site, alone or together, affects receptor dynamics and pocket communication. We observed that CLR binding in the extracellular site expanded the intracellular pocket volume and induced conformational changes in TM6, whereas AA binding in the intracellular site had no such effect on the extracellular site.

The anti-angiogenic and anti-permeability VEGF-A165b has reno-protective properties and has been shown to rescue kidney function in diabetic nephropathy (DN) mouse models (PMID 25542969). We previously identified three new compounds that can increase the expression of the VEGF-A165b isoform. Two of these compounds, named ESSO1 and ESSO3, were discovered through a screen of synthetic compounds that alter VEGF-A splicing (PMID 33941763). A third compound, delphinidin, was found to be the key regulator of VEGF-A splicing in a natural blueberry and sea-buckthorn extract (DIAVIT) (PMID 30865689). This study aimed to investigate the signalling mechanism through which these three compounds regulate VEGF-A splicing and increase the protective VEGF-A165b isoform in renal podocytes. Human podocytes were exposed to a diabetic environment (glucose soup [GS]: 25 mM glucose, 1 ng/ml TNF-alpha, 1 ng/ml IL-6, and 100 nM insulin), in comparison to a normal glucose (5.5 mM glucose) and an osmotic control (5.5 mM glucose + 19.5 mM mannitol) control, for 48 hours. RNA and protein were extracted for RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis of splice isoforms. Immunofluorescence and cell viability assays were also used. Immunofluorescence showed no significant difference in nephrin expression for all treatments compared to control, suggesting that normal podocyte function is not affected by these compounds. Trypan blue exclusion assay, used to assess the percentage cell viability of podocyte cells, showed that they do not affect podocyte cell viability.

Other molecules, like ATM, E2F1, and hnRNPA1, were ruled out. Interestingly, all three compounds significantly increased expression of the splicing kinase CLK1, which has been involved in VEGF-A splicing regulation, suggesting that all three compounds may be increasing the VEGF-A165b/panVEGF-A165 ratio through signalling through this kinase.

The mechanical integrity of epithelial tissues relies on intercellular adhesion proteins which link neighbouring cells and transmit forces across the cellular network. The stability of the intercellular adhesive bonds is critical. Under sustained stress, bond failure leads to cumulative damage that progressively weakens the material and ultimately causes failure at the tissue scale. Although the collective behaviour of adhesion bonds under static loading has been characterised to some extent, their response to dynamic loading remains largely unknown, despite its physiological importance. Here, we combine quantitative experiments and theoretical modelling to elucidate how tissues respond to cyclic mechanical loading. We compare the response of epithelial monolayers to constant tension and cyclic loading regimes. Cyclic loading markedly prolongs tissue lifetime and allows greater total deformation before failure, indicating that intervals of low stress promote bond repair. To interpret these behaviours, we develop an analytical and stochastic framework based on the kinetics of slip-bond intercellular linkers. Our model predicts two intrinsic timescales, rupture and repair, rooted in the molecular dynamics of individual bonds. Under cyclic loading, alternating high- and low-tension phases interact with these timescales to generate three distinct regimes of epithelial behaviour: rupture, slow damage accumulation and stable equilibrium. Normalizing loading parameters by the intrinsic molecular timescales collapses experimental and simulated data into universal stability maps. Our results show that epithelial resilience emerges as an intrinsic property of stochastic bond kinetics. This framework provides a quantitative basis for understanding how the intrinsic dynamic turnover of adhesion bonds enables repair during cyclic loading, allowing tissues to tolerate transient overloads that would cause failure under constant tension. Ultimately, it offers a predictive tool linking molecular adhesion dynamics and macroscopic mechanical behaviour.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

These phenomena have been studied for decades, both experimentally and computationally. In computational models, variants of the classical cable equation for membrane dynamics and an electrostatic equation for the extracellular field are the most common approaches. Such formulations, however, typically decouple the governing equations and therefore neglect the biophysical coupling between the extracellular (E) space, the cell membrane (M), and the intracellular (I) space. Here, we use a finite element-based Extracellular-Membrane-Intracellular (EMI) approach that solves a fully coupled system of equations to study extracellular stimulation and ephaptic coupling of cerebellar Purkinje neurons and neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. These two archetypes differ substantially in morphology, ion-channel distribution, and firing behavior, and together span a range of neuronal properties. Specifically, we assess responses to extracellular stimulation while varying the distance to the stimulation source, the amplitude, and the frequency of the external current. We also investigate ephaptic interactions between neurons, and examine how the firing pattern of one neuron can be affected by the firing pattern of a neighboring neuron, how the rate of synchronization between neighboring neurons depends on cell distance and extracellular conductivity, and finally whether a neuron can directly trigger excitation in a neighboring neuron through ephaptic coupling.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis showed that Phe restriction altered intracellular levels of amino acids that serve as LAT1/4F2HC exchange substrates, suggesting a metabolic basis for enhanced BPA transport. Our results reveal that Phe restriction enhances BPA uptake and BNCT efficacy in a cell line-dependent manner, likely through the modulation of amino-acid metabolism. Therefore, targeted amino-acid manipulation prior to BNCT may represent a promising strategy to improve therapeutic outcomes.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

TLE and FLE are impacted differently however, with TLE affecting primarily episodic, and mildly semantic memory, while FLE presenting with overall lesser declarative impairments and a greater involvement of language processes. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are overall compatible with differential disruptions of medial temporal and fronto-limbic networks in both syndromes, direct comparisons of brain activity and connectivity remain scarce. The current study investigated how alterations in intrinsic functional brain organization, as mapped with resting-state connectivity (rsFC), shapes altered brain network activations in both episodic and semantic memory states. To this end, we acquired task- and rs-fMRI data in 28 TLE patients and 17 FLE patients and 87 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We used activity flow mapping (AFM), a generative machine learning technique that derives plausible task activation patterns via individualized rsFC as well as normative task activation data. Previous studies in HC as well as patient populations have shown that this technique has been effective in identifying mechanisms contributing to atypical functional organization across different context. Overall, AFM reliably predicted task activations across HC, TLE, and FLE, but prediction accuracy was consistently reduced in both patient groups, indicating impaired propagation of task-relevant signals. These reductions co-occurred with abnormal episodic and semantic task activation patterns, atypical rsFC, and behavioral profiles marked by preserved semantic but impaired episodic memory performance in both patient groups. Importantly, although neither task-evoked abnormalities nor rsFC disruptions alone were associated with clinical variables, lower AFM accuracy in patients robustly tracked poorer episodic and semantic memory performance and longer disease duration. Prediction accuracy was driven more by intrinsic functional than structural network features, suggesting that altered network communication, rather than gross anatomy, constrains AFM in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Our work revealed syndrome-specific yet convergent disruptions in paralimbic and heteromodal association systems, linking intrinsic dysconnectivity to a shared episodic vulnerability and semantic resilience across TLE and FLE. By modelling how intrinsic connectivity shapes task-evoked responses, AFM provides a mechanistic account of imbalanced memory-state activations and isolates network-flow pathways as targets for intervention and rehabilitation.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Introduction: Autophagy is a key survival mechanism in cancer, and chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are widely used late-stage autophagy inhibitors. However, their low potency and the need for high doses limit antitumor efficacy and raise concerns about off-target toxicity. We therefore designed hydroxychloroquine silyl derivatives based on the hypothesis that increasing lipophilicity at the terminal 2-hydroxyethyl moiety enhances lysosomal accumulation and autophagy inhibition while preserving the 4-aminoquinoline pharmacophore. Methods: Three HCQ silyl ethers-OTBS (2), OTIPS (3), and ODPS (4) have been synthesized by silylating the terminal hydroxyl of HCQ. Antiproliferative activity and autophagic flux along with apoptosis have been assessed for LC3B-II, p62/SQSTM1, and caspase-3-mediated PARP-1 cleavage. Results and Discussion: The HCQ silyl derivatives retain the core pharmacophore and display improved or comparable antiproliferative activity relative to HCQ, achieving low-micromolar IC50 values. Candidate compounds 2 and 3 strongly induce LC3B-II and p62 accumulation than HCQ, consistent with enhanced blockade of autophagic flux. This autophagy disruption is accompanied by increased PARP-1 cleavage, particularly in aggressive 4T1 and MIAPaCa-2 cells, linking reinforced lysosomal/autophagy inhibition to apoptotic signaling. Conclusion: These findings show that silylation of HCQ enhances autophagy inhibition and pro-apoptotic activity while maintaining pharmacology, identifying HCQ silyl derivatives as promising leads for autophagy-targeting antitumor agents.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Aging is the primary risk factor for most neurodegenerative conditions, making the elucidation of its molecular mechanisms critical for developing effective interventions. Dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the specialized synapse essential for motor function, is an early hallmark of aging and several neurodegenerative disorders, yet its molecular determinants remain incompletely understood. To shed light on potential common underlying mechanisms, we performed a spatiotemporal multiomics analysis of the murine NMJ during aging, uncovering several genes showing decoupling between transcript and protein trajectories that may drive the related progressive motor decline. NMJs of soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles, differing in fiber composition and vulnerability to aging and disease, displayed distinct spatiotemporal dynamics: fast-twitch EDL, more susceptible to degeneration, exhibited stronger mRNA-protein decoupling than aged slowtwitch SOL or younger SOL and EDL muscles. Elevated expression of miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins in aged EDL highlights the key role of post-transcriptional regulation in NMJ aging. This study provides new insights into the physiopathology of neuromuscular aging and offers a resource for investigating mechanisms shared between aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, it opens avenues for AI-driven discovery of drug targets and early biomarkers, potentially accelerating the development of therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

However, how these interactions change over time in response to varying climatic conditions has been poorly explored. This gap limits our ability to identify how temporal changes in coexistence mechanisms sustain diverse communities. Here, we present a modeling approach, coupled with theory, to evaluate how temporal changes in species competitive and mutualistic interactions and intrinsic growth rates promote structural stability. We illustrate our framework using two highly replicated yet independent datasets: (1) annual plant grasslands and (2) wild bee assemblages in shrublands, both subjected to the same variation in rainfall over nine years. We found that both systems respond similarly to year-to-year rainfall changes despite their disparate evolutionary backgrounds. While rainfall variability fosters more diverse communities, prolonged drought leads to substantial biodiversity loss. Although the spatial context dependency modifies some responses, the structural stability of most communities persists through time, with clear winners and losers emerging under environmental variability. The main underlying mechanism determining the observed community stability is a combination of species-specific changes in their growth rates, an increase in the variability of interspecific interactions, and a reduction in the strength of self-limiting effects. Our results underscore the need to consider time-varying species interactions to understand community stability under contrasting climatic conditions and to predict how climate severity influences biodiversity loss.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Why these neurons show particular vulnerability in ALS is still debated, and also why certain MNs remain resilient. We investigated the importance of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and particularly beta2-microglobulin (b2m) in MN susceptibility to ALS as these molecules have been implicated both in prolonging and shortening disease. RNA-sequencing demonstrated that disease-resistant oculomotor neurons (OMNs) and Onuf nucleus MNs had similar b2m and HLA mRNA levels to vulnerable spinal MNs in control tissues. Thus, baseline differences in these transcripts do not explain the differential vulnerabilities of these neurons to disease. Nonetheless, the HLA protein level showed an inverse correlation with spinal MN size, where large MNs, which are lost early in ALS, had low HLA levels. HLA protein levels were also reduced in end-stage ALS patient spinal MNs, while remaining unchanged in OMNs with disease. Spinal MNs uniquely exhibited a significant upregulation of b2m and HLA-C transcripts with disease, likely as a protective compensatory response. Thus, b2m and HLA may relate to vulnerability to ALS. Cross-breeding of b2m knockout mice with SOD1G93A ALS mice resulted in modest transient worsening of functional motor performance, but did not affect life span. There was partial preservation of innervation of particular muscles in SOD1G93A mice lacking b2m, which was insufficient to improve motor behavior. These findings indicate that b2m and HLAs are dynamically regulated in ALS, and may influence MN vulnerability, but they are not major disease modifiers in ALS.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

For gene expression, such conflicts are typically resolved through the evolution of sex-biased regulation. Although sexual antagonism is often assumed to peak in adults, its developmental dynamics remain poorly understood. We investigated the ontogeny of sex-biased gene expression in the sexual stick insect Timema poppense and contrasted it with its parthenogenetic sister species to identify signatures of unresolved antagonism. Using RNA-seq across somatic tissues (brain, gut, legs, antennae) and reproductive tracts throughout post-embryonic development, we found that sex-biased expression in T. poppense is limited in somatic tissues but extensive in reproductive tracts from the earliest stages. Nearly half of the expressed genes are already sex-biased in first-instar gonads, with male- and female-biased genes largely stage-specific. Parthenogenetic females show masculinized expression in somatic tissues throughout development and in adult reproductive tracts, consistent with decay of sexual traits in the absence of mating. By contrast, they show feminized early gonadal expression, likely reflecting unresolved antagonism in the sexual ancestor. Our results reveal the ontogeny of sexual dimorphism in a hemimetabolous insect and suggest that focusing solely on adults underestimates the prevalence of unresolved sexual antagonism.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

D.; Gesquiere, L. R.; Gilbert, J. A.; Alberts, S. C.; Tung, J.; Archie, E. A.", "abstract": "BackgroundIn humans and other mammals, female reproduction is linked to extensive changes in physiology, immunity, hormones, and behavior. These changes likely shape, and may be shaped by, the composition of gut microbial communities. Characterizing the dynamics of gut microbial change across reproductive states, including its relationship to female physiology, is important for understanding how the gut microbiota influences female and offspring health.\n\nResultsHere we characterize longitudinal changes in gut microbiota across reproduction by combining 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from 4,462 stool samples (spanning 14 years of sample collection) with life history data on multiple reproductive events in 169 female baboons. These baboons were members of a well-studied, natural baboon population in Kenya where reproductive state (ovarian cycling, pregnancy, and postpartum amenorrhea) is tracked daily and microbiota data could be paired with measurements of fecal-derived estrogen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid levels. We found extensive changes in baboon gut microbiota as females transitioned between reproductive states. Pregnancy was linked to distinct patterns of ASV richness, community composition, and taxonomic abundances compared to postpartum amenorrhea and ovarian cycling. The most dramatic shifts occurred as females transitioned from the first to second trimester of pregnancy, with altered abundances of taxa that have been linked, in humans and model systems, to host immunity, weight gain, or hormone levels. Host identity was consistently the strongest predictor of gut microbiota composition across states, and this individual signature was strongest during pregnancy. Estrogen and progesterone levels had robust associations with the gut microbiota overall, but the microbial taxa involved in these associations are reproductive state-dependent. Glucocorticoid concentrations were not a major predictor of gut microbiota composition in any state.\n\nConclusionsTogether, our results support the idea that gut microbiota contribute to the complex physiological changes necessary during pregnancy, but that microbial changes during pregnancy are somewhat unique to each female. Variation in steroid hormones drives some, but not all, of these relationships, emphasizing the importance of considering steroid hormone levels in studies of gut microbiota variation. Our results motivate future work on how gut microbiota contribute to reproductive outcomes, including both maternal and offspring health.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

We analyzed the nucleolar pool of Cdc14 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under matched prophase I gating. In a recombination-competent reference (ndt80{Delta}), Cdc14-mCherry formed a predominant single focus with occasional, reversible two-focus episodes that Nop56-GFP placed within the nucleolar compartment (\"nucleolar splitting\"). Splitting rose sharply in dmc1{Delta} ndt80{Delta} and remained high in spo11-y135f dmc1{Delta} ndt80{Delta}, demonstrating that elevated DSB formation is not required and pointing instead to homolog-engagement state as the key variable. Population checkpoint readouts did not map onto the phenotype: Hop1 phosphorylation was strong in dmc1{Delta}, weak/transient in ndt80{Delta}, and undetectable in spo11-y135f, yet splitting was high in dmc1{Delta} and spo11-y135f and low in ndt80{Delta}. Persistence metrics showed that events concentrated early and waned in ndt80{Delta}, whereas dmc1{Delta} and spo11 backgrounds retained activity into later windows, consistently across thresholds. We propose that nucleolar splitting reflects rheological responses of a nucleolar condensate to chromosome-scale forces that vary with homolog engagement. This view is consistent with DSB-independent contributions from telomere clustering into the bouquet configuration, telomere-led rapid prophase movements, and centromere coupling/pairing as routes that shape force transmission to the rDNA territory. In this sense, the nucleolus emerges as a mesoscale, mechanically sensitive readout of meiotic chromosome dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have shown that, like GC B cells, TFH cells also undergo antigen-dependent selection, with competition among TFH clones dictated by their ability to recognize and stimulate B cells. This sensitivity-dependent selection process leads to dynamic remodeling of the TFH repertoire over time. Despite the essential role of TFH cells in B cell selection, the functional consequences of the time evolution of the TFH cell population remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we developed a population dynamics model that explicitly incorporates key TFH cell properties and dynamics. Our analysis predicts that dynamic feedback between B and TFH cell populations provides robust homeostatic regulation of their numbers in the GC, yielding a stable lymphocyte ratio that we verify experimentally. Moreover, our model predicts that TFH clone sensitivity dictates distinct evolutionary strategies during affinity maturation, with low-sensitivity TFH cells accelerating affinity gain at the expense of B cell diversity, while high-sensitivity TFH cells slow affinity maturation but preserve a broader B cell repertoire. These findings highlight the importance of co-regulation between TFH and B cells and suggest that reciprocal stimulation allows the immune system to tune the tradeoff between the speed of affinity gain and the breadth of B cell diversity, a principle that may extend to other adaptive systems.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Analyses of distance-based redundancy test, molecular variance, and population structure consistently revealed that geography is the main determinant of genetic differentiation, with clear east-west clustering in several species. Forest status represented in four levels (commercial not protected, nature reserve, primeval not protected, and primeval protected) exerted a secondary but detectable effect in a subset of taxa, especially among rare and habitat-specialized species. For these species, populations from primeval protected sites showed distinct genetic structure compared to those from commercial stands. Our results highlight that regional connectivity, maintaining gene flow across a large spatial scale, should be prioritized in conservation planning, complemented by the protection of primeval forest refugia and the maintenance of structural complexity in commercial forests.

Various workflows come together in describing those interactions-separation, identification, quantitation, classification-to inform decisions across society. Each workflow has associated equipment, infrastructure and subject matter experts that integrate results for input into those decisions. However, those existing workflows are constrained by their evolution and often require integrated applications of the multiple analytical techniques integrated to form conclusions, thereby increasing cost, complexity and quality. This paper describes an alternative approach to addressing the many limitations of contemporary analytical chemistry. Here machine learning is leveraged to analyze high dimensional data derived from a nano-electrochemical sensor platform, to perform classification, identification and quantitation analyses in an integrative manner from a single-shot measurement. The approach described here for biological samples does not require sample-specific preparation or marker-specific probes and labels to identify and/or quantitate the analyte of interest, thereby liberating the physical measurement of the sample from chemicals and workflows that are tied to the underlying biochemical hypothesis. The nano-electrochemical sensor, as described in a prior publication, transduces the vibrational frequencies of multiple species in the sample into a collection of discrete electronic signatures that represent the sample in a high dimensional space, while using only 2-4 microliter sample volume. The sample analysis relies on training data to identify features in the high dimensional input dataset that are unique to the molecule or phenotype under consideration and distinct from the sample background matrix and/or a set of defined sample controls. The molecule or phenotype associated features can be tracked with clinically identified disease burden in the patient or with biomolecule concentration in the biological sample. The identification of patients with dementia from a plasma test is outlined here to demonstrate the applicability of this approach to classifying phenotypes associated with complex neurological disorders in a marker-agnostic manner. This approach is applied to a specific and quantitative assay of insulin Humalog and insulin Toujeo in a batch that comprises of a mixture of the two peptides, where Toujeo differs from Humalog in three amino acids residues only.

We hypothesized that isolation and then treatment with one or more small synthetic peptide derived from this source could replicate the cellular response to whole solubilized ECM. Decellularized fetal and adult rat hearts were fractionated by molecular weight using SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Analysis of cardiomyocytes cultured on the membranes revealed regions of enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Subsequent isolation and proteomic analysis of the protein bands that that correlated with proliferative regions identified fibrillin-1 as the predominant ECM protein associated with these regions of cardiomyocyte proliferation. One region (residues 55-86) of fibrillin-1 was synthesized as a peptide and tested for a direct effect on cardiomyocyte proliferation. Compared to positive and negative controls, as well as scrambled and alkylated versions, this peptide led to 3-4 fold increase in cardiomyocyte proliferation.

We characterized luminal gains and damage after balloon angioplasty using high-resolution imaging, histology, and mechanical testing. Methods: Fresh diseased human femoropopliteal arteries (FPA) from n=15 subjects (average age 69{+/-}9, range 53-90 years) with different calcium burdens were imaged before, during, and after angioplasty using micro-computed tomography, and luminal gains, calcium fractures, and resulting dissections were quantified.

In less calcified arteries, damage manifested primarily as tears along the internal elastic lamina and within the tunica media. Dissections were present in 53% of all FPAs after angioplasty, with a higher prevalence in more calcified vessels and vessels with stenosis (75% each). Damage initiated at lower biaxial stretches (1.11{+/-}0.02 vs 1.14-1.15) and lower longitudinal stresses (44{+/-}22 kPa vs 57{+/-}31 kPa) in severely calcified specimens compared with lightly calcified arteries, but larger calcium burdens generally required more circumferential stress to initiate damage (66{+/-}27 kPa). Diabetes mellitus was associated with a higher calcium burden. Conclusions: Severe calcification limits luminal gains after angioplasty. Less calcified arteries accumulate damage to the healthier wall while calcium remains mostly intact. These results may inform clinical strategies and the development of better devices to treat PAD.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

J.; Murariu, A. C.; Silverman, J. D.; Gloor, G. B.", "abstract": "Differential expression and differential abundance analyses are commonplace in studies employing high-throughput sequencing approaches; however different tools often fail to return comparable results when applied to the same dataset. Most tools employ various normalisations to attempt to correct for technical variation in the count data. Previously, we demonstrated that these normalisations are often inappropriate due to incorrect assumptions regarding the overall scale (i.e. size) of the biological system in question. In this study, we conducted 100 permutation analyses of 10 RNA-seq datasets to show that scale misspecification results in poor control of the false discovery rate by several commonly-used analysis tools. Moreover, we demonstrate that this can be ameliorated by using a scale model in ALDEx2 or ALDEx3 to account for uncertainty around the size of the system scale. We show that there is an inherent trade-off between satisfactory control of false-discovery rates and sensitivity and that no tool offers both. We also quantify how increasing scale uncertainty affects the difference between groups required for a feature to be reported as differentially expressed. Finally, we provide universal guidance on choosing an appropriate amount of scale uncertainty for any type of analysis. Overall, our work highlights the strengths and pitfalls of commonly used tools for differential expression analyses and highlights the choice between sensitivity and false-discovery rate control that all researchers are making when analysing sequencing data.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify proteostasis stress as a central driver of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) aging and clonal evolution. We show that Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) is activated in aging HSCs to preserve proteostasis and sustain self-renewal. However, this physiological, age-associated adaptive mechanism is co-opted by pre-leukemic Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs to resist proteostasis and inflammatory stress required to fuel clonal expansion during aging. In the context of co-occurring Dnmt3a and Nras mutations, which are frequently observed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (6-13), mutant HSCs and progenitors exhibit heightened dependence on Hsf1 for expansion, malignant transformation and disease progression. Loss of Hsf1, or disruption of proteostasis, impairs expansion of mutant progenitors, delays leukemia onset, and prolongs survival. Together, these findings reveal proteostasis as a key constraint in the aging hematopoietic system that imposes a selective bottleneck. Hsf1 activation enables both physiological adaptation in aging stem cells and pathological clonal outgrowth in pre-leukemic and leukemic states, establishing proteostasis control as a pivotal mechanism linking stem cell aging to clonal hematopoiesis and malignancy.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Strikingly, local primary tumours, including some reaching 7cm, were found to shed little to no circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). Instead, metastatic burden in the liver but not extrahepatic sites, was a main physiologic determinant of ctDNA levels. Whole-genome duplication (WGD), high cell cycle activity, and non-glandular differentiation emerged as tumour-intrinsic features related to increased ctDNA shedding. By contrast, decreased shedding was related to extrinsic features including a reactive microenvironment and unexpectedly, humoral immunity. Analysis of tumour clonal architecture showed that in patients with low ctDNA levels, the signal disproportionately originated from subclones and this signal persisted even when the primary tumour was removed. Disseminated subclones were a significant source of ctDNA in early-stage patients. Longitudinal analysis of patients revealed that subclones seeded metastases and shed ctDNA in the blood years before detection.

Genetic perturbation demonstrated that ALKBH1 overexpression slows proliferation in vitro but worsens survival in vivo by promoting glioma stem-like and neuronal states and suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Ribosome profiling showed that ALKBH1 establishes an A/T-ending codon-biased translational program, enhancing decoding of rare leucine codons (TTA/TTG) and driving synthesis of pro-stemness transcripts.

While cold-responsive neurons in the preoptic area and ventromedial hypothalamus are known to regulate thermogenesis, the specific neurons driving shivering thermogenesis remain unclear. Here, we identify a subset of VGLUT2-positive excitatory neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMHVglut2), enriched with Calbindin D28k (CALB1) expression (DMHCalb1/Vglut2), that selectively initiate cold-evoked shivering thermogenesis. When core body temperature (Tcore) dropped to 33{degrees}C, c-Fos expression peaked in the DMH. RNA sequencing of retrogradely labelled DMH neurons, traced through cervical muscles, revealed CALB1 and VGLUT2 expression in these neurons. Activation or inhibition of DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons specifically affected shivering thermogenesis, while modulation of DMHVglut2 neurons influenced Tcore through both shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis. Activation of CALB1-negative, VGLUT2-positive DMH neurons impacted non-shivering thermogenesis, confirming that DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons drive shivering. DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons exhibited cold temperature-dependent firing, with 23% peaking at 35{degrees}C, 27% at 34{degrees}C, and 50% at 33{degrees}C, explaining the hierarchical increase in shivering intensity during cold exposure. Their activation relies on the cold receptor TRPM8. Knockdown of TRPM8 expression in DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons in vivo reduced cold-evoked shivering. Pharmacological activation or inhibition of TRPM8 in DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons in vitro, respectively, reduced or enhanced cold temperature-dependent firing. These effects were eliminated when TRPM8 was knocked down in DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons.

Damage to vestibular hair cells causes balance impairment, yet it is unclear whether hair cell loss correlates with vestibular dysfunction.

Responses to linear acceleration, measured by the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex (tVOR) and vestibular sensory evoked potential (VsEP), were intact with 25% or more hair cell survival in the macula, and diminished only when hair cell survival decreased further. By contrast, rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (rVOR) responses were significantly reduced with ~31% hair cell survival in the cristae. Further, single-unit recordings of vestibular afferents from cristae and maculae showed more irregular and reduced firing rates, but only those corresponding to cristae displayed reduced sensitivity to head rotation. Limited hair cell regeneration was observed in the extrastriolar/peripheral regions of both maculae and cristae 6 months post ablation, although no significant recovery of the VORs was observed.

Here, we demonstrate that these clusters were already present in the prenatal stage at day 14.5, indicating early developmental effects. Moreover, these clusters were confined to neurons, implying a neuron-specific mechanism of accumulation, and were colocalised with Prpf8, a core spliceosomal protein, suggesting potential impact on nuclear homeostasis.

R.; Nyquist, P.; Nord, A.", "abstract": "Natural selection overwhelmingly favours the largest within animal species. Why average body sizes in the world's temperate birds have declined is therefore both mechanistically confusing and ecologically worrying. We argue that understanding the causes of these declines requires knowledge of how complete, body mass probability distributions are moving across space and time. Using data from 159 North American bird species - spanning 26 families, 53 degrees of latitude, and 25 years of observation since the early 1990s - we show that body mass distributions are not only downgrading, but also becoming narrower, and rapidly losing their upper tails (i.e. the largest individuals), with the most dramatic changes occurring at species' southern range limits. Combining fitness modelling with a novel, distributional variant of the Price equation revealed that these changes are increasingly explained by phenotypic plasticity and not poleward range-shifts, or selection for or against certain body masses within species. Growing contributions of genetic drift are also dismissed. Together, these results show that disproportionate losses of the largest body sizes best explain declining averages within species, and that these losses may well be reversible. Diminishing resource accessibility from rising breeding season temperatures, particularly at lower range limits, are most consistent with these findings.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

In the case of ants, specifically Camponotus (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) present in Chile, their biogeographic affinity with species from the rest of the world has not been studied, with only suggestions of a possible affinity with the Austral/Oceanic entomofauna. On the other hand, the phylogenetic arrangement among the species of the country is not clear, but the history of taxonomic changes suggests a greater kinship between two groups of species according to their similarity in morphological characteristics: 1) C. chilensis, C. ovaticeps and C. spinolae; 2) C. morosus, C. distinguendus and C. hellmichi. To date, no studies have been conducted to directly verify this proposal or to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among Chilean species. In the present study, we evaluated for the first time the biogeographic affinities and phylogenetic relationships of Camponotus species present in Chile through the estimation of a global and local phylogeny using molecular data, which were generated for the first time for Chilean species and complemented with sequences obtained from BOLD for species from the rest of the world. Additionally, specimens that could not be identified with the available taxonomic keys and whose morphological characters did not fit the existing species diagnoses were included in the study to evaluate their phylogenetic position and the possibility that they correspond to new species. The results indicate a greater affinity of the Chilean species with the Neotropical and Ethiopic fauna, in disagreement with the hypothesis of a possible relationship with the Austral/Oceanic fauna. Second, the relationships among Chilean species did not follow the expected pattern suggested by the taxonomic history of the species. It seems that certain morphological characteristics evolved independently more than once in different clades of the phylogeny. Finally, profound genetic divergences were found, both among known species and with specimens that could not be identified a priori, which in some cases also extended to lineages, presumably of the same species, suggesting substantial cryptic diversity and the possibility of several undescribed species.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

STAT5B-Y665F mice developed hepatic lipid accumulation, hypercholesterolemia, and enhanced insulin sensitivity, whereas STAT5B-Y665H mice displayed reduced body weight and impaired insulin responsiveness.

Moreover, the manifestation of these symptoms and other COVID19-related complications varies depending on viral mutations, particularly those occurring in the spike (S) protein of SARS CoV2. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of three different S proteins on nociceptive threshold, as well as the spinal involvement of TLR4 and microglia in this process. Male C57BL/6 mice received intrathecal administration of three synthetic peptides (PSPD2001, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003) derived from the SARS CoV2 S protein or saline. Nociceptive threshold was assessed using the von Frey filament test before and after peptide administration. The spinal involvement of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), microglia, p38 MAPK, and NF kappaB was evaluated using specific antagonists and inhibitors. mRNA expression of TLR4 was assessed by RT PCR, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels by ELISA, and microglial activation in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord was analyzed by immunofluorescence in wild-type, CX3CR1 GFP positive and TLR4 KO mice. In addition, molecular dynamics analysis was performed to assess the temporal stability of the PSPD2003 TLR4 complex. Pharmacological data demonstrated that the peptides induced nociception involving TLR4, microglia, p38 MAPK, and NF kappaB. Notably, PSPD2003 increased TLR4 mRNA expression and elevated TNFalpha; and IL6 levels in the spinal cord. PSPD2003 also enhanced microglial activation in the spinal cord, which was abolished in TLR4 KO; mice. Molecular dynamics analysis results robustly demonstrate that PSPD2003 forms a stable and functionally relevant complex with TLR4. These findings suggest that SARS CoV 2 S protein derived peptides contribute to pain during COVID-19 infection, with spinal TLR4 and microglia playing key roles in this process.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

K.; Mitarai, N.", "abstract": "When bacteriophages infect starved host bacteria, the restrictive host physiology may lead to prolonged latent periods and/or reduced burst sizes, compared to infection of a fast-growing bacterium. Using a mathematical model, we explore a system of two types of virulent phages that have distinct host physiology dependencies and are infecting a shared bacterial host population. We consider different environmental regimes to test whether they can compete and coexist under fluctuating conditions, putting emphasis on phases with limited resources for bacterial growth. We find that phages capable of delaying lysis in response to nutrient limitations can outcompete fast-replicating phages in feast-famine environments. This advantage mainly stems from increased mortality of free phages due to abortive adsorption to already infected hosts during starvation phases. We identify specific system dynamics that either support or suppress the propagation of the delayed lysis phage. This theoretical analysis highlights the competitive benefits and the limitations of delayed lysis as a phage propagation strategy. Our results underscore importance of considering the bacterial physiology dependence of bacteriophage replication in order to correctly predict phage fitness and population dynamics in complex environments.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

B.; Blauwkamp, J.; Absalon, S.; Prigge, S.

This reliance makes the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway a compelling target for antimalarial drugs, with several inhibitors targeting its rate-limiting enzyme, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH), already in clinical development. In this study, we investigated the roles of three other pathway enzymes - aspartate transcarbamoylase (PfATC), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (PfCPSII), and dihydroorotase (PfDHO). PfATC features a unique N-terminal extension predicted to serve as an apicoplast trafficking peptide. However, using antibodies against the native protein and an epitope-tagged version, we found no evidence of apicoplast localization. Knockdown of PfATC expression proved lethal and could not be rescued by an apicoplast metabolic bypass. Complementation assays further revealed that truncation of the N-terminal domain impaired parasite growth, suggesting that this region is important for PfATC function or stability in vivo. PfCPSII, which harbors large Plasmodium-specific insertions between its catalytic domains, was likewise found to be essential for parasite proliferation. To assess the role of PfDHO, we engineered parasites to salvage uracil via heterologous expression of a yeast enzyme. Deletion of PfDHO in this parasite line resulted in uracil auxotrophy, confirming the enzyme's essential function in pyrimidine synthesis. Together, these findings reveal multiple vulnerable nodes within the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Phage are viruses that infect and often kill bacteria, and have served as key models for many molecular biology studies. There are many complex phage-bacterial interactions that dictate the success or failure of the phage life cycle, but many of these are not well understood or characterised. These include the specific interactions to recognize a bacterium during the infection process, bacterial phage defence mechanisms and metabolic pathways that are key to phage replication. In this study a novel Escherichia coli phage, Arnold, is characterised and the genome sequence is reported. We then use transposon-directed insertion sequencing (TraDIS) to screen a library of E. coli mutants to identify over 200 genes involved in Arnold phage infection or in phage resistance. Using this approach, we identified both an outer membrane protein (BtuB, vitamin B12 transporter) and an inner membrane protein (SdaC, serine/proton symporter) involved in phage infection. Deletions in these genes were shown to provide immunity to infection by this phage. Understanding the genetic basis of phage infection and phage resistance should allow us to select or design phage to target specific bacterial pathogens in the future.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

The chromatin organization in these archaea is supposed to rely on nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). Genomes of Sulfolobales species encode multiple members of the Lrs14 protein family, which have been postulated to function as NAPs. Here, we show that one of the Lrs14 family protein, named Sul14a, is a potential key player in dynamic chromatin organization in Saccharolobus islandicus. Sul14a is transcribed in a cell cycle-dependent manner and appears to be essential for cell viability. The protein exhibits DNA-binding activity preferring AT-rich sequences and can bridge DNA in vitro. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that Sul14a is enriched at AT-rich regions of the chromatin. Overexpression of Sul14a leads to cell cycle arrest at G2 phase. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and transcriptomic analyses indicate that Sul14a overexpression results in chromatin contact reduction and global transcriptional changes. In addition, we observed that the chromatin contact pattern changes markedly between 1h and 5h after release from G2 synchronization, corresponding to the lowest and highest levels of sul14a transcription, respectively, during the cell cycle. Our results establish that Sul14a is an NAP intimately associated with chromatin dynamics and global transcriptional changes during the cell cycle in Sulfolobales.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Both live attenuated and inactivated anti-poliovirus vaccines, while highly successful in preventing the disease, have important shortcomings. Live vaccine strains are inherently genetically unstable and can regain virulence, leading to re-emergence of paralytic disease. Inactivated vaccine does not induce the mucosal immunity sufficient to interrupt viral transmission and is made from virulent strains, presenting a biosafety challenge. Recent alternatives, such as new vaccine strains with improved genetic stability and VLP-based vaccines, only partially address these concerns. Here, we investigated another approach to the development of anti-enterovirus vaccines based on efficient trans-encaspidation of replication-competent enterovirus RNAs coding for only the non-structural proteins (replicons) by Newcastle Disease virus vectors expressing enterovirus capsid proteins. Thus, the encapsidated replicon production is driven by effectively replicating enterovirus RNA and the NDV vector. This system is easily scalable and can be adapted to any cell culture provided it can be infected by both the enterovirus and NDV. Unlike the empty VLPs, the encapsidated replicons recapitulate the stability and antigenicity of native enterovirus particles, but cannot propagate beyond the originally infected cell. The protective efficacy of an encapsidated poliovirus replicon immunization was similar to that of the licensed Sabin vaccine strain in a murine model. This approach can easily be adapted to any enterovirus, allowing the rapid development of new, affordable vaccine candidates.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

In Myxococcus xanthus, the PomX/Y/Z assembly associates with and translocates across the nucleoid in a PomZ ATPase-dependent manner to position the cytokinetic FtsZ-ring at midcell. Unlike other systems incorporating a ParA/MinD ATPase, the PomX/Y/Z system incorporates two ATPase Activating Proteins (AAPs), PomX and PomY, that stimulate PomZ activity. While PomX AAP activity, similarly to other characterized AAPs of ParA/MinD ATPases, resides in a short positively charged N-terminal peptide (PomXNPEP), the mechanism of PomY-mediated activation of PomZ remained unknown. We map PomY AAP activity to its C-terminal residues 496-682 (PomY496-682) and show that this activity is important for division site positioning and the initiation of cell division. Structural modeling suggests a bipartite PomY496-682 architecture, comprising a globular domain and an intrinsically disordered region containing the short 5 helix. However, modeling supported an interaction only between 5 and the PomZ dimer. The 5 binding site partially overlaps with that of the prototype AAP ParB on the ParA dimer but 5 lacks a positively charged residue critical for ParB AAP activity. Modeling supported that PomXNPEP binds the PomZ dimer at a site distinct from that of 5 and which overlaps with that of the prototype AAP MinE on the MinD dimer. These findings reveal a non-canonical AAP mechanism of PomY, while PomXNPEP likely functions analogously to MinE, indicating that PomX and PomY act in concert through distinct but complementary mechanisms to stimulate PomZ ATPase activity, thereby efficiently driving the positioning of the cytokinetic FtsZ-ring.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

We tested how environmental context (lake size and ecotype) and host traits (sex, body mass, gravidity, Schistocephalus solidus (S. solidus) infection, and fibrosis) influence stickleback gut microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the lake surface area strongly predicted fish gut microbial alpha diversity. Fish from intermediate-sized lakes harbored significantly more diverse microbiota than those from small and large lakes, independent of ecotype. Body mass was associated with gut microbial diversity. Model-predicted marginal effects from the mass and lake surface area interaction analysis showed that the association between fish mass and microbial alpha diversity was strongly negative in the smallest lakes, weakest in intermediate-sized lakes, and strongly positive in the largest lakes. In addition, sex and S. solidus infection were significantly associated with gut microbiota alpha and beta diversity, whereas fibrosis and gravidity showed minimal effects. Differential abundance analysis revealed lake size-dependent associations between body mass and individual taxa. Together, these results demonstrate that both habitat context and host variation interactively shape stickleback gut microbial communities in the wild.

We show that an uncharacterized Buchnera protein, here designated SyeA, was present in the Buchnera ancestor, is secreted and homologous to secreted effectors of bacterial pathogens and is essential for Buchnera transmission. Buchnera is transmitted via expulsion from specialized maternal cells and uptake by embryos. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that SyeA levels peak upon colonization, accompanied by actin accumulation at the entry site. SyeA localizes outside the host-derived membrane and actin layer surrounding each Buchnera cell and colocalizes in host cytoplasm with Rho1, which regulates actin polymerization. syeA knockdown disrupts colonization and embryonic development and elevates lysosomal activity, leading to Buchnera destruction6. Our findings provide rare insight into how an anciently associated, mutualistic endosymbiont achieves its intracellular existence.

The ability of Aer to detect both oxidizing and reducing intracellular environments redefines its functional range and establishes Aer as a bidirectional redox sensor.

Through comprehensive approaches including in vitro efficacy assays, biofilm inhibition and eradication tests, bacterial membrane integrity analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level detection, and a mouse infection model, Elaiophylin was found to exhibit significant antibacterial activity against multiple clinically MDR S. suis strains. Its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was as low as 0.5 g/mL, and complete bactericidal activity was achieved within 24 hours at 4xMIC. The compound effectively inhibited and eradicated bacterial biofilms, directly killing embedded cells within the biofilm matrix. Mechanistic studies revealed that Elaiophylin functions through multiple synergistic pathways, including disruption of bacterial membrane integrity and induction of massive ROS accumulation, thereby interfering with the proton motive force (PMF), depleting intracellular ATP, and blocking energy metabolism. In the mouse infection model, the Elaiophylin-treated group showed a significantly increased survival rate of 60% and effectively reduced bacterial loads in tissues.

Guided by human imprinting datasets, we screened 65 candidate genes in ferret brain and identified paternal expression of Adam23, maternal expression of Atp10a, and biallelic expression of genes including PXDC1, WRB and UBE3A. Adam23 showed paternal expression in ferret cortex, particularly in the occipital region, whereas it was biallelically expressed in mouse brain. In human SH-SY5Y cells, Adam23 was biallelic in undifferentiated cells but shifted toward monoallelic expression upon neuronal differentiation. CpG analysis of upstream islands indicated that Adam23 imprinting in ferrets is independent of promoter methylation, suggesting a non-canonical mechanism. Functional assays in Neuro-2aTG cells showed that Adam23 knockdown enhances neurite outgrowth, whereas overexpression promotes cell proliferation.

The genomes of a diverse set of Orientia tsutsugamushi strains have recently been analysed in detail, revealing broadly similar gene content with genomes differing primarily in synteny and in the composition of a large arsenal of predicted secreted effector proteins. Given the similarity in gene content, here we asked whether the observed differences in virulence were driven by genome-wide differences in gene expression of bacterial genes, and differences in the ensuing response of infected host cells. To explore this, we carried out a dual RNA sequencing analysis of eight diverse strains of Orientia tsutsugamushi grown in cultured human endothelial cells. An overall analysis found no clear patterns in the bacterial or host gene expression patterns that correlate with the ability to cause disease. We found that all strains induce a strong type 1 interferon response in endothelial cells, but that within that broad response each strain has a unique fingerprint of induced genes likely leading to different disease outcomes when combined with a complex immune system in vivo. We compared expression levels of orthologous genes between different strains and identified some bacterial pathways with constant expression levels whilst others were more variable, leading to the identification of specific pathways under tight transcriptional control during cellular infection.

We show that t-2-hex triggers ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) through the canonical Ire1-Hac1 pathway.

Fmp52 acts synergistically with the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase Hfd1 to promote cellular tolerance to t-2-hex. Mechanistically, t-2-hex directly lipidates Kar2/BiP at a conserved cysteine residue, thereby impairing protein maturation in the ER. Notably, the human protein Tip30 functionally complements yeast Fmp52, highlighting an evolutionarily conserved protective role.

Interestingly, because KO cells contain a normal WT copy of Nexmif on the inactivated X chromosome (Xi), we wondered whether the silenced Xi-Nexmif could be reactivated to restore NEXMIF expression in neurons as a strategy to correct this mosaic deficiency in HET mice.

We observe that 23 of the 39 introns encode stable RNAs, 11 of which represent a novel class of non-coding RNA (ncRNA), which we call stable intronically-encoded RNAs (sieRNAs). These novel ncRNAs are expressed constitutively under normal growth conditions and are conserved in other extremophilic algae. One sieRNA, Q270, is predicted to stabilize a chloroplast polycistronic transcript encoding 17 ribosomal protein genes through direct antisense base pairing. Strikingly, all sieRNAs are polyadenylated under heat stress with long tails ranging from 50-200 nucleotides long, linking them to a potential heat stress response that may be critical for heat adaptation.

However, there is a precondition for such transport: Ultralow energy-consumption rapid ion dehydration; its mechanism is a remaining challenge. Here, we demonstrate that a K+ ion can transfer from the hydration water outside KcsA channel to the water bound in the channel without its hydration water accompanying, i.e., a tunneling-like motion, which provides a basis for the ultralow energy-consumption ion dehydration. In our molecular dynamics simulations, a KcsA channel was divided into three regions: Cavity-1, Cavity-2 and filter. As a hydrated K+ ion moves from Cavity-1 to Cavity-2, there occurs a resonant energy transfer to the ion from the filter-confined coherently oscillating ions, leading to a tunneling-like motion of the ion from the Cavity-1 water to Cavity-2 water with no hydration shell accompanying and no influence on the Cavity-2 water. As the hydrated K+ ion further moves from Cavity-2 to KcsA filter, the ion adjusts its hydration-shell water structure to coherence-resonantly couples with the filter-confined ions, leading to another tunneling-like ion motion to reach complete dehydration. Such two processes cause directionally rapid ion dehydration of KcsA channel, as a basis for the high flux of channel.

We suspected that the heme-domain could move to reach the CPR-domain for electron acquisition and built a model of putative catalytic state to reveal how the electrons are relayed from NADPH to heme. These results are of fundamental importance to understand the catalytic reaction of CPR-containing self-sufficient P450s, which shall provide critical information to the engineering and applications of these enzymes.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

This respiration alignment is consistently reported in laboratory studies relying on sequences of stimulus-driven experimental trials. However, whether such respiration alignment also occurs in the absence of external cues - such as during spontaneous perceptual changes - remains unknown. However, pupil size is known to change around spontaneous changes in perception, and pupil size supposedly covaries with respiration phase, suggesting that indeed respiration may align to spontaneous changes in perception. We investigate the link between respiration, pupil size, and spontaneous perceptual changes while participants (n=21) reported spontaneous perceptual reversals while viewing an ambiguous Necker cube. We confirmed the biphasic modulation of pupil size around reversals (constriction followed by dilation) and the general variation of pupil size with respiration phase. However, this coupling of pupil size and respiration phase broke down around perceptual reversals. Crucially, our data reveal no clear alignment of respiration phase to perceptual reversals although respiration frequency was predictive of the perceptual stability duration. These findings suggest that the temporal predictability of external events is critical for the robust respiration alignment to cognitive events.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

The Salish Sea, located in the Western coastal waters bordering the USA and Canada, is at the current northern boundary (defined by Prochlorococcus versus Synechococcus prevalence ratios) of the range of Prochlorococcus. Predictions suggest that this boundary will shift as warmer waters move northward, providing an excellent system to study host-pathogen dynamics and coevolution in a changing environmental context. In preparation for such studies, we developed and refined methods to sample and sequence cyanobacteria, cyanophages, and their abiotic environment. In addition to basic methodological questions focused on the physical sampling, filtering, viral precipitation, DNA extraction, and technical replicability, we explored how well our filtering and extraction protocols enrich for our main target, picocyanobacteria. The protocol described herein can successfully discriminate large-cell eukaryotic organisms, but size fractionation of picocyanobacteria appears to be affected by the presence of free DNA, multicellular structures, and abundant tycheposons. Our preferred final protocol at the conclusion of these experiments based on yield and processing time is presented. We recovered substantial Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and amoeba-like sequences in most samples, and preliminary exploration of relative taxon sequence read recoveries across locations, over time, and tidal conditions are also discussed.

Here, we investigated the microbial communities and physicochemical parameters in two active and two closed landfill wells from surface to bottom, as well as fill dirt and leachate at a sanitary landfill near Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Amplicon community sequencing fungi, bacteria and archaea revealed distinct microbial community structures across landfill sites. The observed patterns of microbial community succession by depth and age mirror the known phases of the landfill life cycle. Younger surface samples were dominated by aerobic fungi, which transitioned to fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea in older, deeper, layers. Simultaneously, high species richness was preserved across landfill ages, while reduced evenness at specific depths support spatial niche differentiation. In conjunction with the lack of trends found for physicochemical parameters by depth, this supports niche differentiation driven by the highly heterogenous waste inputs. This study provides the first comprehensive vertical profile of bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities across landfill depths and ages, highlighting the influence of these parameters on physicochemical factors and microbial distribution within landfills.

Originally native to Southeast Asia, it is now globally distributed across tropical and subtropical regions and is approaching Europe, with Tenerife as a key hotspot. This study investigates the distribution and prevalence of A. cantonensis in Tenerife across three host groups (rats, gastropods, lizards). Based on prevalence data, we modelled its potential distribution using species distribution models (SDMs) and compared climatic conditions with Hawaii, a region with frequent human cases. Field surveys confirmed A. cantonensis in endemic and introduced gastropods (25.6%; 179/698), rats (21.5%; 14/79), and lizards (24.0%; 31/129), with local prevalence ranging from 2.4% to 41.6%. MaxEnt and Boosted Regression Tree models identified precipitation seasonality as the main driver of distribution, while prevalence was influenced primarily by tree cover density and climatic variability. Northeastern Tenerife, La Gomera, La Palma, and El Hierro showed the highest habitat suitability. However, overlap with densely populated areas was limited, possibly explaining the absence of reported human cases. The MESS analysis, based on climatic data from Hawaii, indicated moderate to high environmental similarity across most of the Canary Islands, except in northeastern Tenerife, where conditions were outside the range observed in Hawaii. A. cantonensis is firmly established in Tenerife, but human cases remain absent, likely due to limited human exposure, cultural practices, and geographic separation of parasite hotspots from urban zones.

Despite the growing interest in the role museums can play in pathobiology research and zoonotic risk assessment, there remains a lack of centralized resources for locating tissue samples that may be leveraged for pathogen discovery. Using the worlds most significant global aggregator of museum specimens, The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), we examined how such tools could be adopted to identify specimens that might be sources of viral genetic material. Focusing on tissue samples from the mammalian orders Rodentia and Chiroptera, speciose taxa that host a high diversity of known zoonotic viruses, we examined temporal, spatial, and taxonomic gaps and patterns in the available tissue samples. Our analyses reveal a heavy bias toward tissue samples collected from the Americas (and consequently, taxonomic groups found in the Americas), with most collected samples housed in North American institutions.

Asgard archaea (phylum Promethearchaeota) which are considered the closest known prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes potentially encode these functions within their large set of eukaryotic signature proteins. The few cultivated members show a complex cell morphology, consisting of a central cell body from which several protrusions extend, filled with an actin-based cytoskeleton. Here, live cell microscopy of two organisms of the Loki- and Hodarchaea lineages showed that they dynamically and drastically change their cell shape on a minute time scale and grow and retract their extensive protrusions with a speed of 1.5 to 5.3 micron/min, respectively. After adhering to a glass surface, cells employ their protrusions to undergo active crawling motion. In the presence of selected actin inhibitors however, the observed dynamics were arrested, suggesting a central role of actin in these processes. The observed cellular plasticity and motility are unique features among prokaryotes and might have been crucial for the emergence of the first eukaryotic cells that are thought to have formed through the association of a member of the Promethearchaeota and an alphaproteobacterium, the ancestor of mitochondria.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

The symptoms caused by Nigrospora species are similar to those of black leaf streak disease (black sigatoka), which has made managing the disease challenging. Furthermore, development of rapid and precise molecular diagnostic methodologies for leaf spot disease has remained elusive. In the present study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection system was developed. The system targets a Nigrospora-specific genomic region, which was identified through comparative analysis of the genus Nigrospora and related genera. The newly designed primer set nigF/nigR specifically detected six pathogenic Nigrospora species associated with banana leaf spot disease (N. chinensis, N. lacticolonia, N. nigrocolonia, N. singularis, N. sphaerica, and N. vesicularifera), while no amplicon was observed for 15 non-Nigrospora species, including Pseudocercospora fijiensis isolated from banana leaves. The results indicate that the primers enable clear differentiation from other genera, including the important pathogen P. fijiensis. The primers also detected diverse Nigrospora isolates (N. banbusae, N. chinensis, N. musae, N. oryzae, N. sphaerica, and N. rubi) obtained from different hosts and regions within Japan, demonstrating broad applicability. Sensitivity testing demonstrated the capacity to detect as minimal as 10 pg of genomic DNA. Additionally, a pathogenic Nigrospora isolate was detected successfully from infected banana tissue.

Mechanistic studies combining molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopic analysis revealed that hydrophobic pockets within the peptide network trap oxygen molecules, while photoexcited AgNCs rapidly deplete invasive O2. Our design ensures stable hydrogen evolution, effectively overcoming the oxygen sensitivity that has long restricted hydrogenase applications in biomedical contexts. In vitro, the in-situ-generated hydrogen effectively scavenges reactive oxygen species, suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

Plant hypoxia responses are known to be regulated through the N-degron pathway, which targets transcriptional regulators for degradation in the presence of oxygen. However, our transcriptomic analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana N-degron pathway mutant seedlings show upregulation of only ~45% of core hypoxia response genes, indicating that additional regulatory mechanisms are involved. In mammals, histone demethylases contribute to hypoxia responses due to their oxygen-dependent activity. Whether histone demethylases regulate plant hypoxia responses has remained unclear. Histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) promotes gene activation and is removed in plants by demethylases such as JUMONJI14 (JMJ14), JMJ16, and JMJ17. Here, we show that global H3K4me3 levels rise in wild-type A. thaliana seedlings exposed to hypoxia. In N-degron mutants, elevated H3K4me3 correlates with activation of hypoxia-responsive genes. We dissected the transcriptomic response to hypoxia and found enrichment of hypoxia response genes and stronger induction of certain core hypoxia response genes in jmj14/16/17 compared to wild-type seedlings.

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics has begun to address this gap by enabling detection of small-molecule metabolites and lipids. However, conventional liquid or gas chromatography-MS approaches require homogenization of whole worms, eliminating spatial information. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) offers an avenue for visualizing metabolite distributions in situ, but its application to C. elegans is hindered by the nematode's small size and thick cuticle which make it challenging for structure preservation during cryo-sectioning and ion image interpretation. We develop an integrated sample preparation workflow to overcome these challenges and enable high-resolution MSI of C. elegans adult hermaphrodites. To facilitate anatomical and ion images' interpretation, we employed a dual-fluorescent reporter strain expressing GFP in intestinal cells and RFP in neuronal nuclei. We optimized embedding media compositions and freezing strategies to preserve tissue architecture and genetically encoded reporter fluorescence during cryo-sectioning. Additionally, we implemented a simple sandwiching method that reproducibly orients worms, allowing consistent longitudinal sectioning. Using this optimized workflow, we achieved matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI of 10-m spatial resolution and demonstrated tissue-specific distributions of lipids and metabolites in adult hermaphrodites.

Here, we investigate this question in the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae, GPA), an asexual generalist herbivore capable of colonizing a wide range of host plants without underlying genetic change. By integrating RNA-seq and DNA-seq from genetically identical clones reared on different hosts, we identified 1,368 high-confidence RNA editing sites (RES), many of which exhibited strong host-dependent differences in editing levels. These RES encompassed all 12 possible nucleotide substitutions, with A-to-I, C-to-U, and U-to-C conversions being particularly prevalent. Editing at several sites shifted dynamically within 48 hours of host transfer and often coincided with changes in transcript abundance. Functional knockdown of the editing genes ADAR1 and ADAR2 reduced editing at specific sites, diminished fecundity, and abolished aphid survival on new hosts. Comparative analyses across aphid species reveal that although the biochemical signatures of A-to-I editing are deeply conserved, the genomic locations and functional roles of edited transcripts are species specific, reflecting lineage-specific adaptive strategies. Together, our findings demonstrate that RNA editing provides a rapid, reversible mechanism for environmental acclimation in GPA, enabling adaptive phenotypic plasticity even in the absence of genetic variation.

Many molecular processes depend not on absolute concentrations but on relative balances: receptor-ligand stoichiometry, enzyme-substrate ratios, and homeostatic feedbacks that govern signaling and metabolism. We propose that these relationships are best captured through pairwise protein ratios, which more faithfully reflect underlying biochemical constraints than raw expression values. We evaluate a machine learning framework that models pairwise log-ratios of proteins (log(A)-log(B)) as features, thereby encoding compositional structure directly into the learning space. Applied to the ROSMAP plasma proteomics cohort (n = 871), this approach substantially improved the classification of Alzheimer's subtypes (NCI, MCI, AD, AD+) with an average AUROC gain of +0.0995 over a strong baseline that incorporated raw proteomics and demographics. The top-ranked ratios (e.g., APOC1:ARID1A, FGF7:LBP) captured converging pathogenic pillars of Alzheimer's disease, including microglial activation, proteostasis dysregulation, and lipid-clearance imbalance, highlighting that ratio-based features recover biologically coherent axes of disease. To assess generality, we scaled the method to the UK Biobank proteomic dataset (n > 53,000; 587 phenotypes). The ratio-based model outperformed raw-level models in 95.% of diseases, with statistically significant (FDR < 0.05) gains in 56.7%.

As such, alleles like the FY*O allele in the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) and the sickle cell allele (HbS) have been naturally selected for in malaria-endemic regions because they confer resistance to malaria, thereby increasing the survival and reproductive success of individuals carrying these protective alleles. As resistance becomes more common in a population, malaria incidence is expected to decline, reducing the evolutionary pressure for additional resistance. In this work, we explore the interaction between these processes. We construct a model with seasonality that tracks the frequency of Duffy genotypes and leverages fast/slow dynamics to analyze the coupled dynamics of malaria transmission and changes in the gene frequency of the DARC genotype. Specifically, we investigate how the burden of malaria changes with the fractions of people with the various DARC genotypes. We derive the basic reproduction number as the threshold condition for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium and interpret the $R_0$ as a weighted sum of the cases generated by infected individuals of each genotype. Additionally, we calibrate our model using data from the Amazonas region in Brazil, which has a polymorphic population with respect to DARC, and still reports a substantial number of \\emph{P. vivax} cases. Analysis of our model determines the proportion of the population that must be Duffy-negative in order for the entire population to be protected against \\emph{P. vivax} without any further interventions. Furthermore, we assess how different proportions of Duffy-negative individuals influence the monthly incidence of \\emph{P. vivax} cases.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

As brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can directly connect the brain and the external world by yielding comparable motor outcomes with artificial apparatus, a central question remains whether the neural dynamics underlying brain-control movement share characteristics or mechanism in natural neural motor control. To enable a systematic comparison, we developed a feedforward BMI framework that enables rapid cursor control to intercept moving targets. This BMI allowed monkeys to voluntarily initiate neural states which controlled the direction and timing of a launched ballistic movement, like skeet shooting. Based on this, we found similar neural representation patterns and computational structure across brain- and arm-control conditions. Notably, in addition to resembling the rotational structure in natural reaching, the neural population dynamics during open loop control also shared preserved manifold with those during arm interception. These findings suggest a fundamental principle and reveal a set of basic computational motifs, for neural control of movement in an abstract hierarchy independent of constraints from actuators. This study thus has potential to reshape the consideration of how BMIs assist paralyzed patients in interacting with dynamic environments and promote next-generation BMI systems.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

However, it remains poorly understood the mechanisms underlying long-lasting vulnerability to relapse. Here, we identify the cortico-subthalamic projection from the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) to the zona incerta (ZI) as a key circuit for controlling relapse to opioid. We uncover that an ensemble of RSG glutamatergic neurons that locate in layer 5 and express B subtype cholecystokinin receptor (RSGGlu-Cckbr ensemble) are critically implicated in the encoding and retrieval of opioid-associated memories, leading to relapse to opioid via innervating ZI GABAergic (ZIGABA) rather than dopaminergic neurons. We further identify that the Cckergic neurons from anterodorsal nucleus of thalamus (AD thalamus) orchestrates RSGGlu-Cckbr-ZIGABA circuit function via release of cholecystokinin (Cck) in RSG.

{"title": "From forest decline to salvage logging: cascading impacts on saproxylic beetle diversity", "doi": "10.1101/2025.11.28.690817", "authors": "Cours, J.; Salle, A.; Larrieu, L.; Lopez-Vaamonde, C.; Mu\u0308ller, J.; Parmain, G.; Thorn, S.; Roques, A.; Bouget, C.", "abstract": "Understanding the cascading effects of forest decline on saproxylic communities is fundamental for optimizing the management of disturbed forests toward biodiversity conservation objectives. We postulated that the nature and intensity of cascading pathways would vary along decline gradients, encompassing stages from stand decline to mortality and subsequent salvage logging, as mediated by shifts in habitat conditions and resource availability. This study was conducted across three representative European forest contexts: fir forests in the French Pyrenees, spruce forests in Bavaria (Germany), and oak forests in the lowlands of the Loire Valley (France). Within these systems, we assessed how the taxonomic and functional -diversity of saproxylic beetles responded to variations in both the diversity and density of deadwood and tree-related microhabitats (TreMs). Our analyses identified key cascading effects of stand decline and mortality that were shaped by the considered beetle guild and by the forest type, reflecting tree species-specific disturbance legacies. Stand decline and mortality produced distinct responses within saproxylic beetle assemblages, as different successional guilds preferentially utilized either dying or dead trees. The overall influence of decline processes was positive in conifer-dominated forests. TreMs played a central role in mediating cascading processes structuring saproxylic beetle communities throughout the forest decline continuum. The increase in TreM heterogeneity associated with stand decline or mortality enhanced saproxylic diversity, with exposed wood and trunk injuries identified as particularly influential microhabitats. Snags and large deadwood elements, especially in spruce forests, and deadwood diversity further contributed to sustaining high levels of beetle diversity. Conversely, salvage logging exerted detrimental effects on numerous guilds, primarily through reductions in TreM diversity, decreased TreM trait dispersion, and the depletion of saproxylic TreMs. Given the pronounced context dependency of the processes driving these cascading community dynamics, and considering the increasing frequency, severity, and spatial extent of forest disturbances and global forest decline, it is imperative to integrate this complexity into management and conservation frameworks. Addressing these mechanisms with greater precision will be critical for maintaining functional biodiversity within rapidly changing forest ecosystems.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Social interactions between individuals within a group often promote behavioral conformity, forming group-level characteristics that correspond to the group's phenotypic and genotypic composition. However, for large-scale groups observed in non-social invertebrates, a theoretical framework establishing how genotypic composition influences group-level characteristics and their intergroup variation has not been verified. Here, we elucidated the mechanism governing activity conformity in multiple Drosophila strains. Furthermore, by combining various strains, we revealed the mechanism by which group-level characteristics are formed as a function of genotype composition. In single-strain groups, image analysis and causal analysis based on information theory revealed that all strains conformed their walking behavior to others' behavior. In contrast, mixed-strain groups exhibited emergent group-level characteristics, with some individuals from certain strains displaying non-conforming behavior. Interestingly, these individuals exhibited high sociality and exerted strong social influence on others, suggesting that specific individuals (genotypes) acting as \"influencers\" within the group plays a crucial role in shaping group-level characteristics. In the wild, each group may develop phenotypic variation influenced by the presence of these individuals.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

However, conventional rigid tFUS arrays suffer from poor skull conformity, compromising patient comfort and targeting precision, while skull-induced aberrations degrade focal accuracy and efficiency. To address these challenges, we present the first flexible, skull-conformal aberration-corrected phased array (F-SCAPA), a transformative solution integrating mechanical adaptability with advanced acoustic correction. The 0.5-MHz array-comprising 8x8 elements-features an optimized fabrication process that enhances material efficiency, ensures flexibility and stretchability, and maintains uniform electrical performance. Coupled with CT-based skull modeling and time-reversal aberration correction, F-SCAPA dynamically conforms to cranial anatomy while compensating for phase distortions. Transcranial validation in a human skull demonstrates precise focusing at 36 mm depth, achieving an axial full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 8.9 mm. This breakthrough overcomes existing limitations by combining mechanical adaptability with high-resolution transcranial focusing, establishing F-SCAPA as a robust, patient-compatible platform for next-generation non-invasive brain therapies.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

However, species-specific metabolic differences between humans and preclinical models hinder the optimisation of next-generation anti-schistosomal therapeutics. Here, to bypass these species-specific limitations, we exploited a humanised mouse model, 8HUM, engineered to express the principal human Phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP1A1/2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/7) as well as the transcription factors constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) in place of 35 murine orthologues. We characterised S. mansoni development, immunopathology, hepatic transcriptomic responses, intestinal microbiome changes and PZQ metabolism as well as PZQ efficacy in 8HUM versus wild-type (WT) mice. 8HUM mice supported normal S. mansoni maturation, infection-associated microbiome dysbiosis, Th2-dominant immune responses and characteristic hepatic pathology. PZQ intrinsic clearance in 8HUM hepatic microsomes mirrored human levels and was >10-fold lower than that found for WT microsomes. Oral dosing revealed human-like PZQ exposures of (R)-PZQ and 4OH-PZQ in 8HUM mice at 25 mg/kg bodyweight and >90% reductions in worm burdens at 100 mg/kg bodyweight (equivalent to that seen in WT mice administered PZQ at 400 mg/kg bodyweight).

However, this method may lead to over- or underestimation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) susceptibility. Computational modeling enables a detailed examination of these limitations and the design of more physiologically accurate stimulation approaches. This study evaluates alternative stimulation methods using a compact, multifunctional rabbit AV node model with autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Methods: The model, based on experimental data, incorporates dual (fast and slow) pathway conduction and simulates the propagation of nodal electrical excitation. Alternative stimulation protocols were implemented and compared with the standard S1S2 approach at both atrial and His bundle stimulation sites. Results: Simulations yielded AV node ladder diagrams, effective refractory periods, and echo response zones across the full range of ANS modulation. The proposed methods enabled accurate characterization of nodal pathway refractory periods during retrograde conduction and identified physiological conditions leading to intranodal reentry. Compared with the S1S2 protocol, the alternative approaches reduced misestimation of AVNRT inducibility and provided clearer separation between echo beats and sustained reentry. Conclusions: The proposed stimulation methods, particularly during His bundle pacing, offer a more accurate and physiologically grounded assessment of AVNRT inducibility than the conventional S1S2 protocol, improving the understanding of nodal conduction dynamics and arrhythmia mechanisms.", "date": "2025-12-01", "journal": ""}

Thirty participants were recruited (12 younger, 26 {+/-} 3 years; 18 older, 75 {+/-} 7 years). Diffusion-prepared arterial spin labeling measured the water exchange rate (Kw) across the BBB; free water (FW) imaging quantified extracellular free water in white matter; and diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces (DTI-ALPS) assessed glymphatic function.
