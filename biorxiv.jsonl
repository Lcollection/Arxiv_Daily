While the tactile sensibility of the hand has been extensively characterized, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of the breast and compared it to that of the hand and back, body regions that span the range of tactile spatial acuity. First, we found that the tactile acuity of the breast was even lower than that of the back, heretofore the paragon of poor acuity. Second, acuity was lower for larger breasts, consistent with the hypothesis that innervation capacity does not scale with body size. Third, touches to different regions of the nipple were largely indistinguishable, suggesting that the nipple is a sensory unit. Fourth, localization errors were systematically biased toward the nipple and more so at greater distances from the breast.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we systematically evaluate linear-nonlinear (LN) models -- applying various regularization techniques -- and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of increasing depth, to predict RGC responses to white noise and natural movies. Our analysis includes publicly available datasets from marmoset and salamander retinas. We demonstrate that LN models, when equipped with appropriate inductive biases, can achieve robust predictive performance on neural responses to both white noise and natural movie stimuli. The optimal inductive biases vary substantially across datasets and stimulus types, indicating that the LN model's performance is susceptible to these choices. This warrants care when using LN models as baselines: their performance is not fixed, and inappropriate design choices can lead to \"unfair\" comparisons. However, even in the optimal inductive bias scenario, CNNs consistently outperform LN models across conditions, confirming the advantage derived from their nonlinear representation capacity. Investigating cross-stimulus generalization, we observe that models trained on white noise generalize better to natural movies than vice versa. Notably, LN models exhibit a smaller performance gap between in-domain and cross-domain predictions compared to CNNs, suggesting that the nonlinear processing captured by CNNs is more stimulus-specific. Overall, this study provides valuable benchmarks and methodological insights for neuroscientists designing predictive models of retinal encoding.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Here we provide such test in the mouse neocortex by analyzing in vivo data from pyramidal neurons, finding that the target learning hypothesis more accurately predicts the neural activity during learning.

In addition to altered fragmentation patterns, cancer patients often have elevated levels of cfDNA, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To address both questions, we analyzed cancer cases with elevated cfDNA levels using Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing. Long-read ONT sequencing captures the full spectrum of cfDNA fragment lengths and enables cell type inference based on DNA methylation markers. One cohort included cases from several cancer types with elevated cfDNA levels, and a second consisted of patients from a single neuroendocrine cancer study. In each cohort, cases with the highest cfDNA levels showed either hypofragmentation (excess fragments of 1-4 kb) or hyperfragmentation (excess fragments <145 bp). Hypofragmentation reflected blood cell DNA released during delayed sample processing, bearing DNASE1L3-associated hallmarks, while in one cohort we also observed ultra-long fragments (>7.5 kb) lacking these hallmarks and consistent with plasma lysis. By contrast, hyperfragmented samples often had elevated levels of both cancer- and blood-derived DNA, indicating an inflammatory or other system process rather than cancer-specific origin. These findings clarify the distinction between biological and artifactual fragmentation, expand our understanding of cfDNA biology, and highlight long-read sequencing as a powerful tool for biomarker discovery.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we developed \"SuccessRatePower\" a free and user-friendly power calculator based on Monte Carlo simulations that takes into account the particular parameters of these experimental designs. Using \"SuccessRatePower\", we demonstrated that statistical power can be increased by modifying the experimental protocol in three ways: 1) reducing the probability of succeeding by chance (chance level), 2) increasing the number of trials used to calculate subject success rates, and in some circumstance, 3) employing statistical analyses suited for discrete values. These adjustments enable even studies with small sample sizes to achieve high statistical power.

The latter result from an abnormal processing of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) leading to its accumulation in plaques. Ex vivo analyses of AD patients brains show an abnormally elevated concentration of metals including Cu, Zn and Fe within these plaques. Altered Cu levels have also been reported in brain regions most affected in AD. These modifications are often accompanied by reduced neuronal Cu levels and by an increased pool of extracellular labile Cu, which in turn promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. To counteract this Cu dyshomeostasis and limit Cu-Abeta-induced extracellular ROS generation, we designed and synthesized two Cu(II)-selective peptide shuttles based on kinetically optimized ATCUN sequences for fast Cu(II) extraction out of Abeta: DapHH-alphaR5W4NBD and HDapH-alphaR5W4NBD. They were also equipped with a fluorophore that showed a very strong response to Cu(II)-binding and release. Interestingly, these two Cu(II) shuttles displayed a dual mode of action. They promptly retrieve Cu from extracellular Abeta;, stop the associated ROS formation, and hence protect both cell culture models and organotypic hippocampal slices (OHSCs) from Cu(Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, these shuttles import and redistribute bioavailable Cu inside cells with a sequence-dependent kinetics.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Loss of Setdb1 blocked differentiation towards the absorptive enterocyte lineage, while the secretory cell types were only marginally affected due to the activation of alternative developmental trajectories. Setdb1 inactivation did not affect global H3K9 methylation at large heterochromatin domains but led to altered distribution of transposase-accessible chromatin regions, aberrant exposure of transcription factor binding sites and premature activation of differentiation-specific genes. The results demonstrate that Setdb1 regulates intestinal stem cell differentiation by fine-tuning chromatin accessibility in open euchromatin regions thereby controlling transcriptional variability between cells.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms in relation to its expression compartment and enzymatic activity have not been completely explored. Moreover, only limited animal models have been studied to delineate its role at the tissue level in influenza infections. Our results showed that Plscr1 expression was highly induced by influenza A virus (IAV) infection in vivo and in airway epithelial cells treated with IFN-{lambda}. We found that infected Plscr1-/- mice exhibited exacerbated body weight loss, decreased survival rates, heightened viral replication, and increased lung damage. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that Plscr1 was required for the expression of type 3 interferon receptor (Ifn-{lambda}r1) and a large subset of ISGs upon IAV infection. The impaired expression of Ifn-{lambda}r1 and downstream ISGs may be responsible for delayed viral clearance and worse lung inflammation in Plscr1-/- mice. PLSCR1 acts as a transcriptional activator of IFN-{lambda}R1 by directly binding to its promotor after IAV infection. In addition, PLSCR1 interacted with IFN-{lambda}R1 on the cell surface of pulmonary epithelial cells following IAV infection, suggesting it also modulated IFN-{lambda} signaling via protein-protein interactions. The lipid scramblase activity of PLSCR1 was found to be dispensable for its anti-flu activity. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data indicated that Plscr1 expression was significantly upregulated in ciliated airway epithelial cells in mice following IAV infection. Consistently, Plscr1floxStopFoxj1-Cre+ mice with ciliated epithelial cell-specific Plscr1 overexpression showed reduced susceptibility to IAV infection, less inflammation and enhanced Ifn-{lambda}r1 expression, suggesting that Plscr1 primarily regulates type 3 IFN signaling as a cell intrinsic defense factor against IAV in ciliated airway epithelial cells.

We segment neurophysiological spectra from 859 participants encompassing a dozen datasets across multiple species, recording techniques, ages 18-88, sexes, brain regions, and cognitive states in health and disease using a novel rhythmicity measure. Combined with simulations and brain stimulation, our results reveal a universal spectral architecture with two categories: high-rhythmicity bands exhibiting sustained oscillations and novel low-rhythmicity bands dominated by brief bursts. This universal architecture reflects stable modes of brain operation: sustained bands suitable for maintaining ongoing activity, and transient bands which can signal responses to change. Rhythmicity thus provides a powerful, replicable, and accessible feature-set for neurotechnology and diagnosis.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Generality is typically discussed in terms of central tendencies, such as an average effect across a compilation of studies, and the role of heterogeneity for assessing generality is not as well developed. Heterogeneity examines the transferability of ecological effects across contexts, though between-study variance is typically assumed as constant (i.e., homoscedastic). Here, I use two case studies to show how relaxing the assumption of homoscedasticity and cross validation can combine to further the goals of evidence syntheses. First, I examine scale-dependent heterogeneity for a meta-analysis of plant native-exotic species richness relationships, quantifying the relationships among unexplained effect size variation, spatial grain and extent. Second, I examine relationships among patch size, study-level covariates and unexplained variation in species richness using a database of fragmentation studies. Heteroscedastic models quantify where effects can be transferred with more or less certainty, and provide new descriptions of transferability for both case studies. Cross validation can be applied to a single or multiple models, adapted to either the goal of intervention or generalization, and showed that assuming homoscedasticity can limit transferability for both case studies.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses.

By using a fluorescent dye loading assay, whole cell patch clamp recordings and real time measurement of ATP release via GRABATP we have demonstrated that Cx43 hemichannels open in a highly CO2 sensitive manner over the range 20 to 70 mmHg. Mutational analysis confirms that the equivalent residues to those in Cx26 that have been shown to be involved in mediating the effects of CO2 on gating of hemichannels and gap junction channels, also mediate Cx43 hemichannel gating. Our data predicts that Cx43 will be partially open and able to release ATP at resting physiological levels of PCO2. We have tested this prediction in acute hippocampal slices, by showing that CO2-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission can be blocked by the Cx43-selective mimetic peptide Gap26. Our data resolves an inconsistency in the literature between in vivo studies suggesting that Cx43 hemichannels are at least partially open at rest, and in vitro studies, performed in the absence of HCO3-/CO2 buffering that show Cx43 hemichannels are shut. Our evidence suggests that the ancestral gene that duplicated to give the alpha and beta connexin clades must have possessed the carbamylation motif. CO2 sensitivity is thus a fundamental ancient characteristic of several connexins that has been lost in more recently derived members of this gene family.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to investigate how ex vivo culture affects muscle fiber contraction and to improve the culture system to preserve muscle fiber morphology and sarcomere function. Additionally, we sought to determine which culture-induced changes can negatively affect muscle fiber contraction. We cultured isolated flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle fibers in several conditions for up to 7 days, and investigated viability, morphology, the unloaded sarcomere shortening in intact fibers, along with force generation in permeabilized muscle fibers. In addition, we examined changes to the microtubule network. We found a time-dependent decrease in contractility and viability in muscle fibers cultured for 7 days on a laminin-coated culture dish (2D). Conversely, we found that culturing FDB muscle fibers in a low-serum, fibrin/Geltrex hydrogel (3D) reduces markers of muscle fiber dedifferentiation (i.e. sprouting), improves viability and retains contractility over time. We discovered that the loss of contractility of cultured muscle fibers was not the direct result of reduced sarcomere function but may be related to changes in the microtubule network.

To test if Slit-Robo signalling is important for cardiac innervation guidance, we analysed Slit and Robo mouse knock-outs. Constitutive Slit2-/- ventricles showed significantly reduced innervation, while Slit3-/- hearts showed temporary increased levels of innervation compared to wild-type littermate controls. Whereas innervation was not affected in Robo2-/-mice, the phenotype seen in Slit2-/- ventricles was recapitulated in Robo1-/- mice. Detailed expression analysis identified expression of Slit2 ligand in the endothelium of the coronary vessels, while Slit3 was highly present in the coronary smooth muscle wall and in the innervation. Both the Robo1 and Robo2 receptors were present in the nerves and at low levels in the vessels. Knocking out Slit2 specifically in the endothelium recapitulated the defects seen in the constitutive Slit2-/- hearts. Ex vivo axon guidance cultures showed that attraction of axons extending from the ganglia was strongly reduced in ventricles with absence of endothelial Slit2 compared to wild-type controls.

Here, we investigated the consequences of FGF23 excess in kidney disease. Methods: This study used three independent disease models: i) anti-glomerular basement membrane (Anti-GBM) disease in male C57BL/6 mice, ii) Adriamycin (doxorubicin)-induced nephropathy in female BALB/c mice, and iii) male DBA/2J mice fed an adenine-containing diet. Anti-GBM and Adriamycin mice and matched control mice received intravenous injections of recombinant FGF23 1g or vehicle for six consecutive days (Anti-GBM) or once (Adriamycin model), with dissection 24h after the last injection. Adenine mice underwent organ harvesting after 15 weeks to establish ex vivo precision-cut kidney slices (PCKS) and 24h treatment with recombinant FGF23 or vehicle. In addition to histological and biochemical profiling, we assessed serum cytokines, biochemistry and renal transcriptomes and histology of mice and patients with IgA nephropathy. RNAseq data and published transcriptomes underwent gene set enrichment, bulk ligand-receptor interaction analysis and cell-type decomposition. Results: Mice with Anti-GBM disease showed decreased glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria and renal tubular casts. FGF23 treatment increased phosphaturia, but also circulating soluble TNF receptor-1. Renal transcriptomes revealed FGF23-driven proinflammatory transcriptional signatures in murine Anti-GBM and also adverse Vcam1, Pdgfrb and chemokine ligand-receptor signaling in Anti-GBM but not in healthy mice. FGF23 increased transcriptome-inferred renal macrophage content in Anti-GBM mice. Findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence. In Adriamycin-induced nephropathy and in PCKS from the adenine nephropathy model, a short-term FGF23 excess caused expression of proinflammatory transcripts. Finally, human data revealed associations between histopathological or transcriptome-inferred renal immune cell infiltration and circulating FGF23 concentrations. Conclusion: FGF23-driven patterns of proinflammatory gene and protein expression or leukocyte overabundance in the kidney were observed in several different models or states of FGF23 excess. The present data provide evidence that excess FGF23 directly drives inflammation in kidney disease and may serve as a therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Strong resistance phenotypes consistently came from combinations of chromosomes or chromosomal regions.

Members of the AsmA-like protein family in E. coli have been implicated in lipid transfer to the OM, with the three largest proteins (TamB, YhdP, and YdbH) proposed as redundant lipid transporters. Of these, TamB associates with the outer membrane protein TamA to form the Translocation and Assembly Module (TAM), a complex also implicated in outer membrane protein assembly. Here, we use a combination of structural modelling, coarse grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the lipid transfer ability of TAM and other members of the AsmA-like family. We show that lipids spontaneously enter from the IM and diffuse upwards through the large periplasmic spanning groove of TamB.

We present a modification of the encoding model framework, adapting it for use with naturalistic vision datasets acquired under fully natural viewing conditions -- without fixation -- by incorporating eye-tracking data. Our gaze-aware encoding models were trained on the StudyForrest dataset, which features task-free naturalistic movie viewing. By combining eye-tracking data with the visual content of movie frames, we generate combined subject-wise gaze-stimulus specific feature time series.

Ligand binding induces PEPR1 heterodimerization with the co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1 (BAK1), followed by PEPR1 internalization, both essential for a subset of Pep1-induced responses. However, the role of BAK1 in Pep1-triggered PEPR1 endocytosis remains unclear. Here, we show that the ligand-induced PEPR1 endocytosis depends on its kinase activity and requires BAK1 C-terminal tail phosphorylation, which is equally indispensable for immune signaling and BAK1 internalization. Using a GFP insertional mutagenesis approach, we generated a partially functional GFP-tagged BAK1 to demonstrate that, following Pep1 elicitation, BAK1 and PEPR1 are endocytosed together with similar dynamics.

Our results revealed significant brain-to-F0 coupling across all speech rates not only in right auditory but also in right parietal, insular, and pre- and postcentral regions, likely including the ventral larynx area. Importantly, the cortico-acoustic coupling peak frequency was higher for natural fast speech to reflect the corresponding F0 increase compared to normal rate and time-compressed speech.

These modifications include SUMOylation, a dynamically regulated PTM involving covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) to lysine (K) residues of target proteins. SUMOylation modulates the activity of thousands of proteins and multiple fundamental host cellular processes, including pathways hijacked by HIV-1 to promote infection and spread. The SUMOylation of several proteins during HIV-1 infection has been characterized. However, the broad effects of HIV-1 infection on the SUMOylation of the host cell proteome is largely unknown. To date, SUMOylation has not been explored by large-scale proteomics in the context of HIV infection, where many SUMO-regulated host dependency factors remain to be identified. In this study, we performed a proteome-wide, mass spectrometry (MS)-based screen to identify proteins that are SUMOylated during HIV-1 infection. Here, and in biochemical assays, infection with HIV-1 led to the widespread increased SUMOylation of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (HNRNP) A/B proteins, a protein family central to the regulation of alternative splicing. Intriguingly, this phenotype was found to be driven by expression of the HIV-1 Viral Infectivity Factor (Vif), suggesting a novel function for this protein aside from APOBEC3G degradation. We selected HNRNPA2B1 (A2/B1) and HNRNPA3 for further study, where depletion of these proteins led to the altered splicing of HIV-1 viral RNAs and dramatically reduced HIV-1 infectivity. Considering the enrichment of SUMOylation sites within the RNA-binding domains of the HNRNPA/B family, our data suggest a novel mechanism involving HIV-1-induced, Vif-mediated SUMOylation of host RNA splicing factors as a means to regulate HIV-1 alternative splicing. Broadly, our findings suggest that infection with HIV-1 alters the SUMOylation of many unexplored host cellular proteins, and provides a significant proteomic resource for their future mechanistic study.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Alanine scanning shows that basic residues R27 and R87 within the eIF5A core, rather than the hypusine side chain, provide the principal P-site tRNA stabilisation. Higher magnesium alone accelerates elongation but raises UAG and UGA read-through to roughly fifteen percent, revealing a trade-off between speed and fidelity when tRNAs are unmodified.

These delineations deliver further benefit when they include assessments of population vulnerability to extinction from pressures such as climate change. However, delineations and vulnerability assessments are particularly difficult within highly diverse species, such as the salmonid fish Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), that show extensive phenotypic and genetic variation within and across locations, variable and complex life histories, and broad geographic distributions. As yet, the nature and scope of Arctic charr diversity has not been characterised at the scale needed to delineate key conservation units in Scotland. To identify evolutionarily significant and vulnerable populations to prioritise for conservation, we conducted a genomic study of Arctic charr populations across Britain and Ireland with a focus on Scottish populations (N=64 populations; 24,878 SNPs; 410 individuals). We found that most lake populations represented distinct genetic clusters, with limited gene flow between them and resulting in substantial genetic differentiation. Higher level groupings of genetic similarity across catchments likely reflect historic anadromy and migration, with populations primarily grouping east or west of the central watershed divide in Scotland. Analysing genetic offset, also known as genomic vulnerability, we identified strong inverse correlations between genetic vulnerability with latitude and distance to the sea suggesting that more southern and more inland populations are more vulnerable to loss due to climate change. Additionally, patterns of vulnerability across several additional metrics identified further populations that may be at high vulnerability to loss. We further used our genetic data, along with phenotypic and geographic information, to identify populations of greatest evolutionary significance. This highlighted the most important ones to protect are those in locations with multiple ecotypes, a key facet of functional Arctic charr biodiversity, and populations that are the only ones in their Hydrometric Area.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Ongoing studies aim to understand their functions in order to evaluate their potential as anti-cancer therapeutic targets. Evidence suggests the existence of subcategories of CG genes, depending on location on autosomal or sex chromosomes, reliance on DNA methylation for transcriptional regulation, and profile of expression during gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. To clarify this issue, we developed CTexploreR, a R/Bioconductor package that integrates an up-to-date reference list of human CG genes (n=146) with multiple bulk and single-cell methylomic and transcriptomic datasets. Based on promoter methylation profiles and responsiveness to a DNA methylation inhibitor, 74% of the CG genes were classified as DNA methylation dependent (Methdep). Intriguingly, most X-linked CG genes (69/70) fell into this category, thereby implicating DNA methylation dependency in the well-documented over-representation of testis-specific genes on the X chromosome. We further observed that, whereas X-linked Methdep CG genes become demethylated and activated in pre-spermatogonia in the fetal testis, most of them resist DNA demethylation in female germ cells and remain therefore silent in fetal and adult oocytes. Importantly, a number of X-linked Methdep CG genes (e.g. FMR1NB, GAGE2A, MAGEB2/C2, PAGE2, VCX3A/B) maintained this maternal-specific imprinting after fertilization, and were expressed exclusively in female preimplantation embryos, which inherit a paternal X chromosome. Together, our study using the CTexploreR package has allowed us to show that X-linked CG genes undergo transient maternal imprinting and contribute therefore to transcriptional sexual dimorphism in early embryos.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

This study provides the first analysis of parameter-dependent tPBM effects on real-time brain activity in 46 participants with diverse skin tones, quantified via individual topography angle (ITA). EEG was recorded before, during, and after right prefrontal cortex tPBM while participants watched naturalistic videos. Protocols were designed with two wavelengths (808/1064 nm), two pulsation frequencies (10/40 Hz), and three irradiances (100/150/200 mW/cm2) to analyze baseline-normalized changes in EEG band power and sample entropy during and post-stimulation. Both wavelengths produced distinct spectral reorganization patterns with fundamentally different profiles. 808 nm achieved net delta reductions while enhancing alpha and gamma power, with 40 Hz producing the largest global alpha increases among all conditions. Conversely, 1064 nm increased delta power but generated larger beta and gamma enhancement at 40 Hz. Across wavelengths, 40-Hz stimulation produced greater low-to-high frequency power shifts compared to 10 Hz. Sample entropy changes remained stimulus-bound, while power effects persisted post-stimulation, particularly gamma with 808 nm and beta-gamma with 1064 nm at 40 Hz. Notably, biological factors profoundly modulated responses: lighter skin tones consistently showed enhanced effects across multiple frequency bands, while sex-dependent patterns emerged with males demonstrating distinct theta responses at 40 Hz. These multi-parameter interactions revealed complex effects that challenge simplified parameter selection approaches. The profound influence of skin tone and sex on treatment responses necessitates personalized protocols for equitable therapeutic outcomes, establishing EEG as a sensitive biomarker for precision neuromodulation across diverse demographics.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Indeed, a link between plasticity and heterozygosity, i.e. the measure of polymorphism, has previously been dismissed. Here, we compare the thermal plasticity of abdominal pigmentation in eight Drosophila species, four belonging to the melanogaster species group and four to the montium group. Despite a conserved developmental pathway for melanin synthesis, the genetic architecture of its variation has significantly evolved, being polygenic in most species (like D. melanogaster) and Mendelian or invariable in others. By investigating the thermal plasticity of this trait in species with distinct architectures, we show the degree of plasticity to strongly associate with heterozygosity. Plasticity was resurrected in hybrids between species with no plastic responses but with contrasting melanism, and was higher in heterozygotes in species with simple Mendelian polymorphism. In plastic cases, pigmentation dominance is reversed depending on the developmental temperature. We propose simple genetic models with empirical molecular support to explain this link between phenotypic plasticity and genetic polymorphism.

Despite its clinical significance, the nasopharyngeal microbiome remains poorly characterized with few resources available. A robust standardized framework for distinguishing healthy from dysbiotic communities is needed to advance nasopharyngeal microbiome research. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis that yielded 28 independent nasopharyngeal microbiome studies encompassing 7,790 uniformly reprocessed samples from public repositories. Further, we developed a newly introduced, three-stage large language model-assisted background decontamination pipeline that mitigates study-specific technical and environmental variation while preserving biological signal integrity. We identified six reproducible nasopharyngeal community state types (NPCSTs), each dominated by distinct genera: Moraxella (I), Corynebacterium-Dolosigranulum (II), Staphylococcus (III), Haemophilus (IV), mixed (V), and Streptococcus (VI). NPCSTs were key drivers of the sample diversity rather than disease status, requiring NPCST-stratified downstream analyses. Co-occurrence network analysis and functional pathway predictions revealed NPCST-specific microbial interactions and metabolic signatures. To bridge the translational gap from research to clinic, we developed the Nasopharyngeal Microbiome Health Index (NMHI), an independent continuous wellness score that achieves an AUC of 0.90 and 0.92 in internal and external validations, respectively. Unlike binary disease classifiers, the NMHI quantifies nasopharyngeal health along a spectrum, enabling risk stratification for respiratory infections, treatment monitoring, and dysbiosis identification in PCR-negative symptomatic patients.

The intimate relationship between spine morphology and function suggests that decoding disease-related abnormalities from spine morphology can aid in developing synapse-targeted interventions. Here, we describe a population analysis of dendritic spine nanostructure applied to the objective grouping of multiple mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders. This method has identified two major groups of spine phenotypes linked to schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An increase in spine subpopulation with small volumes characterized the spines of schizophrenia mouse models, whereas a spine subset with large volumes increased in ASD models. Schizophrenia mouse models showed higher similarity in spine morphology, which was caused by a reduced speed of nascent spine growth. The expression of Ecrg4, a gene encoding small secretory peptides, was increased in schizophrenia mouse models, and functional studies confirmed its critical involvement in impaired spine dynamics and shape in schizophrenia mouse models. These results suggest that the population-level spine analysis provides rich information about the heterogeneous spine pathology, which facilitates identification of new molecular targets related to core synaptic dysfunction.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Under this framework, early life adversity (ELA) - which often limits energetic capital - could shape investment in growth and reproduction, as well as trade-offs between them, ultimately contributing to variation in evolutionary fitness. Using long-term demographic, behavioral, and physiological data for 2,100 females from a non-human primate population, we tested whether naturally-occurring ELA influences investment in the competing physiological demands of growth and reproduction. By analyzing ELA, growth, and reproduction in the same individuals, we also assessed whether adversity intensifies trade-offs between life history domains. We found that ELA influenced life history patterns, and was associated with modified growth, delayed reproductive maturity, and small adult body size. Different types of ELA sometimes had distinct reproductive outcomes - e.g., large group size was linked to faster reproductive rates, while low maternal rank predicted slower ones. Adversity also amplified trade-offs between growth and reproduction: small body size was a stronger predictor of delayed and reduced reproductive output in females exposed to ELA, compared to those not exposed. Finally, we examined how traits modified by ELA related to lifetime reproductive success. Across the population, starting reproduction earlier and maintaining a moderate reproductive rate conferred the greatest number of offspring surviving to reproductive maturity. These findings suggest that ELA impacts key life history traits as well as relationships between them, and can constrain individuals from adopting the most optimal reproductive strategy.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a widely evolved genomic signature, G-tract-AG motifs consisting of guanine tracts closely upstream of AG dinucleotides, which is significantly associated with single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), particularly within non-coding regions (NCRs). Approximately 9,000 such G-tracts within human genes are disrupted by variants of the cis-splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Functionally, G-tracts repress splicing at the adjacent 3'AG, primarily by stalling the second transesterification step. Disruption of the G-tracts by SNVs relieves this repression, enabling splicing and generating novel transcript isoforms. These G-tract-disrupting SNVs are in cis across the majority of protein-coding genes and are among thousands of rare variants causing genetic diseases. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the maintenance of transcriptome integrity while still allowing diversity by a mammalian-evolved genomic signature, particularly for the NCR SNVs in association with diverse traits and a new framework for their functional annotation.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

We advance prior literature by using genome-wide PGIs, assessing cross-ancestry heritability differences, and comparing the performance of PGIs based on standard versus family-based GWAS. Our findings confirm systematic reductions in PGI predictive power for non-European ancestries-lowest in African (24%), followed by East Asian (37%) and South Asian (51%) genetic ancestries-with biologically proximal traits exhibiting greater portability than behavioral and social traits. We show that the relative importance of factors underlying reduced portability varies across traits and ancestries: in African ancestries, linkage disequilibrium and allele frequency differences explain most of the loss (82%), compared with smaller contributions in East (34%) and South Asian (25%) ancestries. Finally, we find that family-based GWAS PGIs can modestly improve portability for select traits, such as BMI in African ancestry, suggesting that part of the portability gap may reflect population-specific confounds in standard PGIs.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Using evolutionary conservation and deep learning-based variant effect predictions, we apply this framework genome-wide in the human lineage and identify positive selection on protein sequences of genes involved in brain and heart development, chromatin accessibility in binding sites of dozens of transcription factors, and non-coding substitutions in compact genomic regions with reinforcing cell type-specific effects on cis-regulatory activity.

Increasing evidence implicates neuroinflammation as a contributor to photoreceptor degeneration extending beyond the initial genetic insult. Although estrogen has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system, its role in RP remains controversial, with some studies suggesting a paradoxical exacerbation of retinal pathology. To address this discrepancy, we identify estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1) as a central immunoregulatory hub in RP. Transcriptomic analyses of rd1 and rd10 revealed upregulation of estrogen-responsive and inflammatory pathways, with Esr1 expression markedly elevated during degeneration. TUNEL assays demonstrated that systemic estradiol (E2) exerted divergent effects, protective in rd1 yet deleterious in rd10, whereas selective pharmacological activation of Esr1 with propyl pyrazole triol (PPT) consistently reduced photoreceptor death, preserved dark-adapted ERG responses, and downregulated inflammatory mediators including Tnf-, Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1, Cd68, and Iba1. Mechanistically, Esr1 activation repressed microglial Tnf transcription and disrupted a self-sustaining Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1-Tnf- signaling loop driving microglial recruitment, activation and neurotoxicity in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Targeted interventions confirmed tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (Tnfr1) as the principal mediator of Tnf-induced photoreceptor death: selective inhibition with R7050 conferred superior protection compared with broad-spectrum Tnf- inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab). Cx3cr1 blockade likewise suppressed microglial activation and improved visual outcomes. Collectively, our findings establish Esr1 activation as not merely an external intervention but the amplification of an intrinsic self-protective program, positioning Esr1, Tnfr1, and Cx3cr1 as actionable therapeutic targets to suppress neuroinflammation and preserve vision in RP and related retinal disorders.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

In our pilot experiment, observers viewed a face-scene blended image (sample) and selectively attended to either the face or scene aspects of the sample. They then judged whether the attended aspects were the same as or different from that of the subsequent test image. In three out of four observers, we found that the coding axis, which distinguishes faces and scenes, was rotated when perceptual content transforms into working memory, not only in the visual cortex but also in some higher association cortical areas. In these regions, exclusive combinations (i.e., perceived face and memorized scene vs. perceived scene and memorized face) were successfully classified by linear decoders, indicating that perception and working memory are represented in partially distinct subspaces. Such specific coding may help prevent confusion between perception and memory. Meanwhile, however, cross-decoding of visual contents across perception and working memory was also robust, indicating common coding components between them. Such common coding may help to explain why even though we generally have no difficulty in distinguishing working memory content from perceptual content, there is yet a sense in which their contents are qualitatively similar.

Given the importance of gut microbiota composition for animal biology and ultimately fitness (e.g., via effects on physiology, immunity and even behaviour), there is considerable interest in understanding which factors shape its variation. Here, we tested whether local environments are an important source of microbial diversity for mammalian guts, by sampling the faecal microbiota of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (Myodes glareolus), as well as environmental microbiotas, across Wytham Woods. We first find that both species share a low proportion of their microbiotas with local environments and that most shared microbes are aerotolerant. We then detect that microgeographic patterns (namely soil chemistry) are associated with variation in the microbiota of local environments but this does not translate to microbiota variation between animals. Nevertheless, between-individual gut microbiota variation is strongly associated with where animals are sampled, suggesting that other local factors (e.g., biotic environment, interactions between individuals) are much stronger predictors of microbiota composition than local abiotic factors. Finally, we find that wood mice (but not bank voles) are more likely to share microbes with local than non-local environments, but that local environments still contribute little to animal microbiotas. Our findings challenge the prevailing view that mammalian microbiotas are strongly affected by local soil chemistry or the abiotic environment, while further supporting the prediction that biotic and/or other intrinsic factors (which can also act on a local scale) contribute more to microbiota composition.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

There are many variables associated with increasing human impacts that might be associated with urbanization, and this makes it challenging to identify both how traits vary across diverse urbanized landscapes and the variables that might drive that variation. To better define the mosaic of urban environmental heterogeneity and identify similar types of environments that are comparable across its complexity, here we develop a multivariate landscape classification framework and apply it to classification of land area in the state of California, USA. We used a hierarchical cluster analysis to group 7,829 government census tracts into Environmental Zones based on a set of 19 independent environmental characteristics, including climate, land cover, pollution, and socio-economic variables. Cluster analysis identified nine major Environmental Zones, which were differentiated based upon complex combinations of variables that did not align with conventional urban vs. natural dichotomies or gradients. Environmental Zones also occurred as mosaics of many zones within cities and differed in their relative abundance between cities, reflecting complex urban landscapes unique to each area. We then asked if these Environmental Zones were better able to explain trait variation than conventional urban vs. non-urban classification using a case study of the invasive, annual plant Centaurea melitensis, commonly found throughout much of California. Seeds from seventeen populations of C. melitensis were collected from six Environmental Zones, including two heavily urbanized, and four more natural/agricultural. Seeds were grown in greenhouse conditions, and eight vegetative traits were measured. No trait differed significantly between urban and non-urban sites, but four traits differed according to Environmental Types (length of longest leaf, SLA, root diameter, and the number of flowerheads). Traits differed between the heavily urbanized zones, as well as among the relatively more natural zones. Our results reveal that more complex multivariate classifications of the urban mosaic can identify similar, comparable environments across complex landscapes and better explain trait variation in organisms navigating urbanized environments.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

In North America, Culex mosquitoes are primary vectors of West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis, as well as pathogens that impact birds and horses. The Culex life cycle consists of four stages, eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults, each with distinct development and mortality rates. Only active (non-diapausing) adults can reproduce, and environmental factors such as temperature, photoperiod, and rainfall influence population dynamics and stage-specific abundances. We develop a stage-structured model that integrates historical climate data and available experimental data to describe how key climate variables regulate life history parameters. Specifically, oviposition rates depend on temperature, maturation and survival are influenced by both temperature and rainfall, mortality is modeled as temperature-dependent, and diapause induction and termination are driven by photoperiod. Unlike many previous models focused on tropical mosquitoes, our framework explicitly incorporates diapause, a critical adaptation for temperate Culex populations. Simulations reveal strong nonlinear responses to warming, moderate temperature shifts amplify the differences in mosquito abundance across rainfall regimes, whereas higher warming leads to convergence at consistently high densities. Rainfall amounts determine whether populations remain suppressed, variable, or strongly amplified, whereas warming extends the active season and elevates population abundance. These results underscore the importance of jointly considering temperature, rainfall, and photoperiod in predicting mosquito dynamics. Our findings suggest that climate change may expand the seasonal window of mosquito activity and raise vector abundance, thereby increasing opportunities for pathogen transmission. The model provides a mechanistic framework for exploring how interacting climate drivers shape vector ecology and highlights priorities for data collection and adaptive control strategies under environmental change.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Key drivers include minimum and maximum temperatures, and importantly, downward shortwave radiation (DSR). Increased DSR, linked to \"global brightening\" from reduced air pollution since the 1990s, provides crucial thermal benefits. This enables the bug's basking behavior to effectively elevate body temperatures, mitigating cold stress and enhancing overwintering survival in newly colonized northern regions. Focusing on Ukraine and Latvia, optimal habitat is predicted in Ukrainian regions like Transcarpathia, aligning with observed occurrences, while Latvia shows minimal invasion chances. This study rigorously integrates statistical modeling (including SHAP analysis) with biological insights, demonstrating how temperature extremes and DSR act as physiological \"bottlenecks\" for the species' successful adaptation and expansion. The findings advance understanding of insect range dynamics under climate change and regional air quality improvements, providing critical insights for biodiversity conservation and targeted pest management.

We grow bacteria in a bioreactor in conditions that closely resemble the assumptions of the model, and compare the model predictions with experimental observables such as the probability and time to resistance evolution, mutant number distribution, and the genetic composition of the evolved populations. We show that the model fails to reproduce some aspects of the experiments (failing differently for different antibiotics) but that simple modifications of the model significantly improve its predictive power.

We used structural equation modelling to test three key hypotheses: trait evolution promotes speciation (H1: trait flexibility hypothesis), and, speciation and trait evolution rates are constrained by allometry (H2: allometric constraint hypothesis) and genome size (H3: large genome constraint hypothesis). We detected seven major speciation rate shifts during the ca. 110-million-year history of palms. Tip-derived speciation rates increased with faster evolution in leaves and plant height, supporting H1, whereas correlated evolution between trait evolution rates indirectly influenced speciation, supporting H2. Large genomes decreased plant height and stem diameter evolutionary rates, but increased leaf size evolution and speciation rates, thus partly supporting H3. Our findings illustrate how the complex interplay between genome size, allometry and trait evolvability affect speciation, emphasizing the importance of holistic approaches in macroevolution.

These collections not only preserve species morphology and aspects of ecology, but increasingly provide access to historical molecular data, including insights into wildlife disease. As several pandemics have originated from animal viruses spilling over into the human population (i.e., SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, 2009 H1N1 influenza, and HIV/AIDS), characterising the diversity of viruses circulating in wildlife populations is essential for proactive pandemic preparedness. Yet, current surveillance remains biased toward contemporary viruses of economic importance. One solution to bridging spatiotemporal gaps in wildlife virus knowledge is retrospective screening of vouchered wildlife specimens. However, such efforts have been hindered by formalin fixation of specimens, which degrades and cross-links nucleic acids. Here we demonstrate that formalin-fixed vouchered wildlife specimens retain both host and viral RNA fragments after being stored for up to sixty years.

At low concentrations and short-term exposure it is not considered acutely harmful, but long-term exposure can result in mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. As air pollutant toxicity is known to be mediated by the respiratory epithelial lining and secretion of cytokines, we demonstrate our system to be sufficiently sensitive to capture increased cytokine secretion corresponding to increasing concentrations of Benzene. Of utmost relevance is our finding that an accumulative effect could be detected, only caused by prolonged exposure at low concentrations of Benzene, previously shown to be non-toxic in classic short-term in-vitro studies.

Injury disrupts this cellular environment and marks the start of regenerative processes. It remains unclear whether bone fracture alters the osmolality of bone marrow, and how associated changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) affect marrow-resident cells in the onset of regeneration. Here we present analyses of human tissue samples indicating that osmolality differences among tissue types lead to a sudden drop in bone marrow osmolality upon fracture, which in turn enhances ECM viscoelasticity. We reveal that a sudden osmolality drop, mimicked in vitro by lowering ion concentrations, triggers bone regenerative processes in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), markedly enhancing their spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation while residing in osmolality-responsive viscoelastic ECM. Conversely, in non-physiologically elastic ECM, similarly increased osmolality augments MSC osteogenic differentiation, suggesting that ECM viscous dissipation redirects cellular responses to osmotic changes. Mechanistically, the regenerative function of the osmolality drop depends on the matrix providing cell-adhesion ligands and physiological viscoelastic properties. Sequencing data show altered gene expression already two hours after differentiation start, with distinct characteristics related to chromatin structural changes specifically associated with hypoosmolality. Our results suggest that the osmolality drop serves as fast-acting regenerative stimulus for MSCs by extracellularly enhancing matrix viscoelasticity, while altering chromatin structure intracellularly. This stimulus upon injury potentially orchestrates the individual responses of multiple cell types within a niche, facilitating a collective action towards regeneration. Learning how to leverage osmotic cues to induce regenerative cascades may eventually advance local and personalized therapeutic strategies for patients with impaired healing capacity. We anticipate that the integration of osmotic and mechanical ECM properties, as demonstrated in our assay, will catalyze advanced 3D cell culture systems and offer new perspectives on material design in tissue engineering, disease modeling, and mechanobiology.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Current lysosome-targeting agents such as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) show limited efficacy due to transient activity and dose-limiting toxicities. To overcome these limitations, we developed Lysostilbenes, a new class of hybrid small molecules combining the CQ pharmacophore with lysosome-disrupting trans-4,4'-dihydroxystilbene. Lysostilbene-4 emerged as the lead candidate, demonstrating ~30-40-fold greater cytotoxicity against PDAC cells than parental compounds, while sparing non-malignant cells. At nanomolar concentrations, Lysostilbene-4 induced rapid, irreversible lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), initiating a lysosome-mitochondria apoptotic cascade via cathepsin-B release, BID cleavage, BAX activation, and caspase-mediated apoptosis. In parallel, it abrogated lysosomal recovery by impairing repair, lysophagy, autophagosome maturation, and uncoupling TFEB-driven transcriptional programs from effective lysosome biogenesis. TFEB knockout further sensitized PDAC cells, underscoring TFEB as a key determinant of lysosomal resilience and a potential predictive biomarker. Importantly, Lysostilbene-4 was well tolerated in preclinical mouse models at supra-therapeutic doses without systemic toxicity. These findings position Lysostilbene-4 as a first-in-class lysosome-targeting therapeutic that enforces sustained lysosomal collapse while disabling adaptive recovery mechanisms, providing a mechanistically precise and safe strategy against PDAC.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a key transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor progression, but its expression profile and clinical significance in IDC-NST remain incompletely understood. Methods: We analyzed FOXM1 expression in a cohort of 100 IDC-NST patients using RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry (IHC). FOXM1 mRNA levels were quantified, and protein expression was scored based on the percentage of positive tumor cells. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high and low FOXM1 expression groups were identified, followed by pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses. The prognostic value of FOXM1 was evaluated by recurrence-free survival (RFS) analysis. Results: FOXM1 protein expression correlated significantly with mRNA abundance in 22 representative cases (p < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis identified a cut-off value of 4.954 CPM for FOXM1 mRNA to predict recurrence (AUC = 0.642). High FOXM1 expression was associated with larger tumor size, higher histological grade, and negative hormone receptor status. Patients with high FOXM1 expression exhibited significantly poorer 5-year RFS (73.6% vs. 92.3%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed FOXM1 as an independent prognostic factor (HR 15.26; p = 0.026). Transcriptomic profiling revealed 190 upregulated and 197 downregulated genes in the FOXM1-high group, enriched in cell cycle and mitotic pathways. PPI network analysis positioned FOXM1 as a central hub coordinating genes involved in chromosomal stability and mitosis. Conclusions: FOXM1 overexpression is a strong independent predictor of poor prognosis in IDC-NST and plays a critical role in tumor proliferation and genome integrity. These findings support FOXM1 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target, warranting further investigation into FOXM1-targeted therapies for breast cancer management.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Despite its cultural and nutritional significance, teff has limited genomic tools, constraining progress in yield improvement and trait optimization. Here, we assembled and resequenced the Teff Association Panel (TAP), a diverse set of 265 landraces and cultivars, to investigate the domestication history, genetic diversity, and agronomic traits of teff. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses confirm Eragrostis pilosa as the direct progenitor of teff, with domestication likely occurring in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. We generated a high-quality reference genome for E. pilosa and found extensive chromosomal collinearity and minimal gene loss compared to teff, with teff-specific genes enriched in functions related to domestication traits. We identified signatures of selection across the teff genome and used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to map loci associated with seed color and panicle architecture. Integrated GWAS, expression, metabolic, and comparative genomic analyses pinpoint a major seed color locus containing orthologs of the TT7 cytochrome P450 gene involved in flavonoid hydroxylation and the TT2 MYB transcription factor regulating proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. For panicle architecture, we identified a strong association near a teff ortholog of Dense and Erect Panicle 1 (DEP1), a key regulator of inflorescence structure in rice and sorghum. This suggests convergent selection on shared genetic pathways controlling panicle morphology across cereals. Our findings confirm the evolutionary origin of teff, identify key domestication loci, and highlight untapped genetic diversity among Ethiopian breeding lines. These genomic resources provide a foundation for accelerating teff improvement through molecular breeding and genome editing to enhance yield, resilience, and nutrition.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Cell proliferation is necessary to maintain tissue homeostasis, but proliferation carries with it a risk of cancer. Nevertheless, nature abounds with examples of organisms that achieve low rates of cancer while also proliferating to maintain tissue homeostasis. To understand how organisms might achieve both of these goals, we developed a dynamical model describing cell birth, death, and mutation in a population. The model identifies two distinct regimes. In one regime, as expected, decreasing proliferation delays accumulation of neoplastic cells. In another regime, unexpectedly, increasing proliferation suppresses accumulation of neoplastic cells. In this regime, when more cells proliferate, more cells correspondingly die as a consequence of homeostatic feedback. As long as neoplastic cells are detected and killed preferentially, the high flux of cells acts as a proofreader, eliminating neoplastic cells. High-flux proofreading may seem costly, but it can be effective even when the system does not have a precise detector of neoplastic cells. As a first experimental test of whether high-flux proofreading is biologically relevant, we examined the moon jelly, a cnidarian. Neoplasms have rarely been observed in cnidarians, and yet simply inhibiting proliferation is sufficient to promote neoplasms in the moon jelly. Together, the model and experiments show that high-flux proofreading is an effective cancer resistance strategy. Because cell birth, death, and mutation are fundamentally conserved processes, high-flux proofreading may be widespread. The quantitative framework presented in this study offers clear experimentally testable predictions to assess high-flux proofreading in other systems, and its potential utility for cancer prevention and treatment.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "The drive to sleep is inescapable but its biological substrate remains largely elusive. Until recently, the search for sleep centres in the mammalian brain focussed on subcortical neurons that promote sleep or wakefulness, or induce state transitions. However, the regulatory elements of mammalian sleep circuitry, which govern the timing, amount and intensity of sleep, have proven difficult to elucidate. Growing evidence suggests an essential role for the cerebral cortex. Here we used a chemogenetic approach to test whether prefrontal cortex (PFC) layer 5 pyramidal neurons partake in the regulation of sleep. We found that inhibiting or exciting Rbp4-Cre neurons in the PFC with hM4Di/hM3Dq Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) increases and decreases sleep, respectively. Targeted PFC DREADD inhibition of Rbp4-Cre neurons induces sleep that electrophysiologically and architecturally resembles spontaneous sleep. In contrast, widespread cortical DREADD inhibition induces sleep that is punctuated by frequent brief awakenings, has suppressed rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and is followed by a rebound in electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA), typically observed after disrupted or lost sleep. Our work demonstrates that local modulation of cortical activity can bidirectionally change the amount of global sleep. This represents an important step in the dissection of sleep circuitry, aids the identification of molecular counterparts of sleep pressure, and accelerates the delineation of top-down sleep-regulatory pathways. Together, these lay the foundation for neurobiologically-informed sleep treatments, such as targeted non-invasive brain stimulation and cell-type specific pharmaceuticals, to better modulate sleep in humans.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

In spatial representation, localized space coding is implemented by place cells in the hippocampus (HPC), while phase coding is implemented by grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Both strategies have their own advantages and disadvantages, and neither of them meets the requirement of representing space robustly and efficiently in the brain. Here, we show that through reciprocal connections between HPC and MEC, place and grid cells can complement each other to overcome their respective shortcomings. Specifically, we build a coupled network model, in which a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) with position coordinate models place cells, while multiple CANNs with phase coordinates model grid cell modules with varying spacings. The reciprocal connections between place and grid cells encode the correlation prior between the sensory cues processed by HPC and MEC, respectively. Using this model, we show that: 1) place and grid cells interact to integrate sensory cues in a Bayesian manner; 2) place cells complement grid cells in coding accuracy by eliminating non-local errors of the latter; 3) grid cells complement place cells in coding efficiency by enlarging the number of environmental maps stored stably by the latter. We demonstrate that the coupled network model explains the seemingly contradictory experimental findings about the remapping phenomena of place cells when grid cells are either inactivated or depolarized.

Using a common cross-species atlas as a scaffold, we introduced a multi-objective path efficiency metric that weighs projection strength against axonal length and applied directed shortest-path algorithms to quantify inter-regional influence. This framework revealed both conserved and divergent organization: the entorhinal-hippocampal projection remained the most efficient in all species, while humans exhibited strengthened temporal-insula-frontal circuits and reduced olfactory influence, rhesus macaques showed peak efficiencies in inferior temporal outflows, and marmosets maintained high olfactory influence.

M.; Christiansen, L.; Heyl, M.; Mastropasqua, A.; Van Hoornweder, S.; Thielscher, A.; Tomasevic, L.; Siebner, H.", "abstract": "Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex can elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in target muscles, reflecting corticospinal excitability. MEP amplitudes increase with TMS intensity and can be facilitated by tonic muscle pre-activation. Since conventional transcranial evoked potentials (TEPs) also grow with increasing TMS intensity, cortical and corticospinal responses are often considered two facets of the same process. If this were true, changes in physiological motor state should modulate TEPs and MEPs in a similar manner. Methods: To compare the state-dependency of cortical and corticospinal responses to single-pulse TMS, we simultaneously recorded TEPs and MEPs in 16 healthy young adults during relaxation and isometric contraction of the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. For each condition, 100 biphasic TMS pulses were delivered to the left primary motor hand area at five different intensities centered around the resting motor threshold. Results: TEP and MEP amplitudes increased with stimulation intensity. As predicted, tonic muscle contraction consistently facilitated MEP. On the contrary, muscle contraction attenuated two key peaks of the TEP (N15 and N100). The state-dependent effects of corticospinal and cortical responses were not correlated. Discussion: Both TEPs and MEPs are reliably modulated by motor state, yet they differ in direction and their magnitudes do not scale with each other. These findings challenge the assumption that cortical and corticospinal responses are two aspects of the same process. MEP facilitation during contraction likely reflects increased spinal excitability, whereas TEP attenuation may reflect reduced responsiveness of cortico-cortical or cortico-subcortical networks.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Energy deficits associated with lack of food availability and sickness-associated anorexia elicit distinctive hypometabolic states, however how such states are integrated with higher-order cognition is largely unknown. Patch-foraging paradigms have proven useful for deciphering evolutionarily conserved and ethologically grounded insights into cost-benefit decision-making as animals continually deliberate between exploiting and exploring their environment. We developed and extensively validated a touchscreen-based patch-foraging task for mice in which food reward dynamically varied across trials, in a dataset comprising over 111,000 sequential decisions from 35 adult male mice. Contrary to predictions that emphasize the impact of inflammation to blunt effortful reward-driven behaviour, our results demonstrate that systemic lipopolysaccharides-induced inflammation promotes hyper-exploitation by attenuating exploratory choice behaviour in animals interacting with complex food environments. Such behaviour can be seen as a bias towards immediate outcomes, with impulsivity as a feature affecting the weighting of temporal factors. Given the ubiquity of systemic inflammation in numerous infectious, metabolic and psychiatric disorders featuring dysfunctional value- and cost-sensitive behaviour, these results provide insight into how immunometabolic states are linked to altered decision-making.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

We address this challenge using neural field theory, a biophysically-grounded framework for modelling large-scale neural dynamics. We first show how the autonomous activity of cortex and hippocampus emerge from corticothalamic and hippocampo-septal feedback loops, respectively, giving rise to cortical alpha and hippocampal theta rhythms. We next integrate these two systems through topologically and topographically informed coupling between cortex and hippocampus. Weak coupling yields spatially precise correlations between cortical and hippocampal activity, consistent with neurophysiological recordings. Stronger coupling pushes both the cortex and the hippocampus toward criticality, triggering state transitions and mode mixing, such that activity propagates across spatial scales and reorganizes both cortical and hippocampal dynamics. These disruptive, unstable processes also provide an explanation for the frequent involvement of the hippocampus in seizures. This prediction is validated using intracranial electroencephalographic data from human patients with focal onset epilepsy. Together, these results establish a geometrically and biophysically grounded framework that gives a unifying account of large-scale cortico-hippocampal dynamics and provides a physically principled foundation for studying other distributed brain systems.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Clinical studies highlight the importance of neural oscillations underlying motor deficits. Yet, how dopaminergic medication impacts brain activity for gait therapy remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we explored the influence of apomorphine on cortical oscillations during self-initiated locomotion on a runway in the unilateral 6-OHDA rat model of PD. In this task, deficits are characterized by slow movements and repeated interruptions of the gait sequence. Our results show that apomorphine reduced akinesia, increased voluntary transitions to gait, and prolonged individual gait bouts leading to an overall increase in the travel distance on the runway. In contrast, kinematic analysis revealed that these prokinetic changes were accompanied by a reduction in leg velocity and step length. At the neural level, behavioral changes correlated with a shift from beta and low-gamma to high-gamma brain rhythms. Beta and low-gamma significantly correlated with reduced transitions to gait, while high-gamma lead to a shift away from akinesia to prokinetic motor states. Together, our results provide new insights into the cortical regulation of locomotion and reveal the potential of apomorphine to differentially regulate gait sequence execution and gait kinematics. We propose that the prokinetic effects of apomorphine are best explained by the concept of a motor state equilibrium that is defined by the observable motor states, their durations and number of state transitions.

In species with pollination-induced wilting, pollination rates should also influence phenotypic expression of genetic variation in longevity, raising questions of how and when variation in floral lifespan is shaped by adaptation. Methods: We experimentally manipulated pollination rates in a wild population of Sabatia angularis (Gentianaceae). We asked how treatments influenced pollen gain curves, the phenotypic distribution of floral longevity, trait correlations, and potential costs. We further asked how abiotic factors influence longevity and how they may interact with pollination conditions. Key results: Mean, variance, and maximum of longevity expressed increased with declining pollination. A flower longevity-number trade-off and positive longevity-flower size relationship persisted regardless of pollination context. Plants with more, not longer-lived, flowers suffered greater seed predation, potentially mitigating the flower number-longevity trade-off. The vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and seasonal changes constrained longevity. VPD had the strongest effect under the poorest pollination conditions, where longer-lived flowers would otherwise be favored.

The existing genome annotation includes mainly protein-coding genes, which are more straightforward to annotate than the lower-expressed lncRNAs. Therefore, this study aimed to annotate lncRNAs in the crucian carp genome, investigate their potential involvement in regulating mRNA abundance in response to anoxia and reoxygenation, and further characterize any differentially regulated lncRNAs and their potential interaction partners (nearby genes). Using next-generation RNA sequencing of brain samples from crucian carp across normoxia, anoxia, and reoxygenation conditions (n=10 per group), 145,264 transcripts were assembled with a reference-guided approach. Using the bioinformatic tools CPC2, CNCI, CPAT, and FEELnc, we identified 6,072 lncRNAs among the assembled transcripts. We observed a substantial transcriptomic response to anoxia, with a total of 56,440 differentially expressed (DE) transcripts (adjusted p-value < 0.05; | log2(fold change)| > 0.38), including 1,321 lncRNAs. The FEELnc classification module identified multiple proximal RNA transcripts that may help to predict lncRNA functions, and due to their proximity to potential interaction partners (IPs), were likely cis-acting. Most (60%) of the interaction sites between DElncRNAs and their targets were located between genes (intergenic), predominantly on the same strand in intergenic subtypes, and primarily nested in the genic context.

We present BBERT, a BERT-based language model trained to distinguish whether a metagenomic read originates from bacteria. Using an out-of-distribution detection framework, BBERT flags reads that diverge from learned bacterial patterns as non-bacterial. By focusing on this fundamental split in the tree of life and training only on bacterial sequences, BBERT achieves high accuracy and enables large-scale analyses of soil metagenomes. Testing across 1,971 soil metagenomes, BBERT reliably identified bacterial reads, predicted coding potential, and determined reading frames directly from short reads, without assembly. Applying BBERT enhances downstream analyses and assembly performance, enabling a more robust analysis of microbial processes and their environmental drivers.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have shown that a well-designed molecular representation is critical for improving the accuracy of deep-learning-based molecular property prediction methods. However, the lack of large-scale data enriched with detailed physicochemical information hinders effective learning of an informative molecular representation. To fill this data gap, we introduce qcMol, a dataset consisting of 1.2 million molecules from 95 datasets with high-quality quantum chemical annotations, to facilitate molecular representation learning as well as downstream molecular property prediction. Chemicals in this dataset include drug-like compounds, metabolites and molecules with matched experimental data, covering 247,448 kinds of scaffolds and a broad spectrum of molecular sizes. Each compound in qcMol is annotated with detailed quantum chemical information, obtained through reliable quantum chemical calculations based on B3LYP-D3/def2-SV(P)//GFN2-xTB as well as the follow-up wave function post-analysis. These features are organized into multiple formats, allowing for flexible integration into diversified molecular representation learning frameworks. The broad data distribution, comprehensive quantum chemical annotations and flexible data formats jointly enable qcMol to serve as the pre-training resource as well as the benchmark test set for deep learning models, benefiting the practical in silico drug discovery. qcMol is freely accessible from https://structpred.life.tsinghua.edu.cn/qcmol/", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

To increase knowledge about this disease, several studies have focused on the transcriptional control mechanism by analyzing the role of transcription factors (TFs) in GA. Methods: This study identified differential expression (DE) of TFs in 74 GA samples using NGS, biostatistical analysis in R, and comparison with 68 normal tissue samples in the genetic databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Results: 1,564 human transcription factors were DE. Of these, 87 were selected using the established cutoff value of AUC [&ge;] 0.95, and 25 were analyzed for their influence on GA carcinogenesis. Based on their role in biological processes, nine TFs were found to be underexpressed due to their growth suppression and cell differentiation properties, notably the TFs IRF3 and CXXC1. Sixteen TFs were overexpressed, associated with drug resistance, disease promotion, metastasis, and poor prognosis in GA, such as AhR, NCoA3, RRB1, and STAT3, respectively. Conclusion: This study integrated systematic bioinformatics and NGS, which revealed novel TFs with important oncogenic and suppressive functions in GA. Therefore, it provides new insights into genes with potential biomarkers for prognostic prediction in GA, which may offer important implications for clinical practice and may effectively target treatment, monitoring, or disease recurrence.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Their de novo differentiation in the placenta is regulated by local intercellular interactions involving primed uterine immune cells, fetal syncytiotrophoblasts, and the cytokine environment. Trophoblast-derived, HLA-G-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs) can bind to T lymphocytes, thereby influencing their differentiation and cytokine production. Thus, these EVs play a role in establishing and maintaining a tolerogenic environment. In our study, we used the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line to model the effects of trophoblast-derived EVs. Large EVs derived from BeWo cells (BeWo-12.5K lEVs) reduce IL-6R expression on CD4+ T cells. This modifies the IL-6 pathway by downregulating the transcription factors STAT3 and NFKB1, and PIAS3, while upregulating STAT1. This may be caused by specific microRNAs (miRNAs), such as hsa-mir-92a-3p, hsa-mir-520f-3p, and hsa-mir-25-3p. These microRNAs are present in BeWo-12.5K lEVs and target the IL-6 pathway. BeWo-12.5K lEVs induce phenotypic and functional changes in T cells, enhancing the ratio of CD4+/CD25+ T cells that produce IL-10. Pregnancy-associated IL-6R downregulation has been demonstrated in clinical samples. Significantly lower levels of IL-6R were detected on circulating CD4+CD25+ T cells in healthy pregnant women than in healthy non-pregnant individuals. This finding reflects the in vivo significance of our in vitro studies. Our studies suggest that communication between maternal and fetal cells significantly influences the development and maintenance of local T cell polarity.

L.; Feng, Y.; Wang, J.; Awuoche, E.; Nguyen, H.; Orfano, A.; Yang, L.; Aksoy, E.; Aksoy, S.", "abstract": "Peptidoglycan Recognition Proteins (PGRPs) are conserved pattern-recognition receptors that detect microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and activate host immune responses. Compared to other dipterans, the tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans morsitans) genome encodes only five PGRPs- PGRP-LA, -LB, -LC, -SA, and -SB - far fewer than most dipterans, likely reflecting its sterile blood diet and streamlined microbiota. Here, we identify PGRP-LA as a critical regulator of peritrophic matrix (PM) integrity in the cardia (proventriculus), the tissue responsible for PM production. The PM is a chitinous sleeve-like barrier that separates the midgut epithelium from the ingested bloodmeal, supporting digestive homeostasis and infection resistance. We show that pgrp-la is prominently expressed in the cardia, transiently induced after a bloodmeal in newly eclosed flies, and reinduced following subsequent feedings, likely in response to blood- constituents or mechanical stretch. This induction is sustained during microbial exposure and prolonged in trypanosome-infected flies. RNAi-mediated reduction of pgrp-la significantly increased the prevalence of midgut trypanosome infections, indicating a protective role during early infection. PGRP-LA did not mediate infection resistance via canonical IMD pathway signaling, as its silencing did not affect antimicrobial peptide expression. Instead, PGRP-LA modulated the expression of PM-associated genes and gut barrier integrity. Silencing pgrp-la reduced PM structure, increased midgut weights and enhanced fly survival following oral challenge with entomopathogen Serratia marcescens, likely due to earlier epithelial immune responses through a compromised PM. Similar phenotypes were observed when flies were fed anti-PGRP-LA antibodies, supporting a structural role for PGRP-LA. In addition, soluble variant surface glycoproteins (sVSGs) from trypanosomes and knockdown of microRNA-275 (miR-275), also decreased pgrp-la expression, suggesting that PGRP-LA is part of a broader regulatory network, including the miR-275/Wingless signaling. Collectively, our results identify PGRP-LA as novel regulator of PM biogenesis and vector competence in tsetse, expanding the functional repertoire of PGRPs in insect gut barrier maintenance beyond canonical immune signaling pathways.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Since current therapeutics are often insufficient, PDs impose a significant morbidity and mortality burden. CD19xCD3 bispecific T cell engagers (TCEs) - originally developed for B cell malignancies - have shown promise in treatment-refractory autoimmune diseases like systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. To explore their potential in PDs, we tested a murine CD19xCD3 TCE in a mouse model of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA), a prototypical PD. The TCE selectively depleted B cells in blood and bone marrow, but not spleen, of healthy mice. Mice with clinically manifest immunization-induced EBA were randomized to receive either the CD19xCD3 TCE or control treatment upon reaching a predefined disease severity. After 13 weeks, 45% of TCE-treated mice achieved remission, versus 23% of controls. This improvement correlated with reduced antigen-specific B cells, though total and antigen-specific IgG levels were unchanged. These findings suggest that CD19xCD3 TCE preferentially target autoreactive B cells and may be effective at lower doses than those used in oncology.

We demonstrate that instead of TTAGGG-like repeats these telomeres are composed of unique tandem arrays which are in most cases specific to a particular chromosomal end. In contrast to other basidiomycetes, the Microstromatales genomes lack orthologs coding for the telomerase catalytic subunit Est2 and a shelterin component Tpp1 indicating that noncanonical telomeric arrays are maintained by a telomerase-independent mechanism.

Using a murine model that mirrors human hematologic and inflammatory responses, we show that DENV impairs megakaryopoiesis, causing necrotic loss of bone marrow megakaryocytes and compensatory thrombopoietin elevation. Megakaryocyte-derived platelets exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and phosphatidylserine exposure, consistent with apoptosis. Systemically, DENV drives P-selectin-dependent platelet activation and platelet-monocyte aggregates, accompanied by increased plasmatic chemokines (CXCL4, CCL5, CXCL1) and vascular leakage in target organs such as liver and lungs, reflecting heightened thromboinflammation. Pharmacologic blockade of P-selectin or inhibition of P2Y12 with clopidogrel restored platelet counts, rescued megakaryocyte numbers, and reduced systemic inflammation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate for the first time in an in vivo model that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia arises from combined megakaryocyte impairment and platelet hyperactivation and highlight platelet-targeted interventions as potential therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

R.; Gao, C.-F.; Wu, S.-F.", "abstract": "Mating in insects commonly induces an alteration in behavior and physiology in the female that ensures optimal offspring. This is referred to as a post-mating response (PMR). The induction of a PMR requires not only male-derived factors transferred with semen during copulation, such as sex peptide (SP) in Drosophila, but also intrinsic female signaling components. The latter signaling remains poorly understood in most insects, including the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, a devastating rice pest. In BPHs the PMR comprises a reduced receptivity to re-mating and increased oviposition. Here, we demonstrate that the neuropeptide corazonin (CRZ) and its receptor (CrzR) are critical for the PMR in female BPHs. Peptide injection and knockdown of CRZ expression by RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis demonstrate that distensible CRZ signaling suppresses mating receptivity in virgin N. lugens females and mediates a reduction in re-mating frequency and increased ovulation. The CrzR is highly expressed in the female reproductive tract, and CrzR-knockdown phenocopies Crz diminishment. Importantly, female CRZ/CrzR signaling is indispensable for male seminal fluid factors (e.g. maccessin) to induce the PMR. With disrupted CrzR signaling, seminal fluid or maccessin injection fails to reduce female receptivity. Notably, CRZ is not produced in male accessory gland (MAG) and thus not transferred during copulation. However, male Crz knockout impairs the PMR in mated females and combining male and female Crz knockouts nearly abolished the PMR. Transcriptomics of the MAG indicates that Crz knockout affects the expression of numerous seminal fluid protein genes. Finally, we found that also in female Drosophila melanogaster, disrupted Crz signaling resulted in increased re-mating and reduced oviposition, while CRZ injection suppressed virgin receptivity and increased oviposition. In summary, our study reveals that endogenous female CRZ signaling and male-derived signals cooperate to regulate post-mating transitions in BPHs and Drosophila.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Cell wall integrity (CWI) is monitored by plasma membrane-localized proteins, of which the receptor kinase THESEUS1 (THE1) has been identified as a key CWI sensor in Arabidopsis. THE1-dependent CWI signaling contributes to pathogen resistance, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. We report that THE1 loss-of-function mutant plants exhibited increased susceptibility to the cell wall-penetrating fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum, which was associated with reduced synthesis of the antimicrobial metabolite camalexin. Cell wall damage (CWD) caused by cellulose biosynthesis inhibition was sufficient to induce camalexin accumulation in a THE1-, WRKY33-, MPK3- and calcium-dependent manner. Based on our previous finding of coordinated CWI and plant elicitor peptide (Pep) signaling, we investigated the interaction of both pathways for camalexin accumulation. Pep3 treatment caused strong suppression of CWD-induced camalexin biosynthesis downstream of THE1 without affecting WRKY33 expression. Using RNA-Sequencing and mutant analyses, we discovered four transcription factors that were induced by CWD in a jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent manner and were under negative regulation by Pep3 signaling. We identify MYB47 as a positive regulator of camalexin biosynthesis, activated by THE1 and JA upon CWD, but suppressed by Pep3 through its inhibition of the CWD-induced JA pathway. These data show that CWI signaling is important to activate antimicrobial defense via camalexin, while the negative regulation of CWD responses by Pep3 signaling may represent a mechanism to deactivate local defense at pathogen infection sites when damage prevails.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

However, they often overlook crucial aspects of adaptation, including the long-term temporal evolutionary dynamics, the predictability of evolutionary outcomes, the influence of past evolution on future evolutionary trajectories (contingency), and the extent and diversity of molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation. Experimental evolution has been a useful tool to answer these questions, but extracting fundamental principles and predictive features of evolutionary outcomes from these datasets remains challenging due to the large number of covariates and confounding effects, such as differences in experimental setups, species lifestyle, gene content, and evolution rate. Here, we sought to circumvent these challenges by comparing distant yeast species with similar evolutionary features but different evolutionary history and genome architecture, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We evolved 10 populations of the fission yeast for 10,000 generations in the same conditions as a pre-existing budding yeast dataset, i.e. high-sugar media and hypoxic conditions, allowing us to observe repeatable evolutionary outcomes within species but diverse molecular mechanisms and targets of adaptation across species. Most of the S. pombe evolved populations exhibited adaptations to hypoxic stress (HS) at the expense of increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (OS). This trade-off has not previously been observed in S. cerevisiae evolved populations or wild Kluyveromyces lactis, but is seen in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus and clinically relevant populations such as some cancer cells, indicating that parallelism is pervasive in the tree of life and that mechanisms of adaptation can be shared among closely related or distant species. Despite similar gene content and identical environments, recurrent adaptations across S. pombe populations involved different genes than in S. cerevisiae and were mostly detectable at the transcriptomic level. This suggests that trans-regulatory effects may play an important role in adaptation on short evolutionary timescales and that differences in evolutionary outcomes between these species may be attributed to contingency.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

B.; Zohren, J.; Dalla Libera, A.; Wunder, J.; Alonso-Blanco, C.; Coupland, G.; Fulgione, A.", "abstract": "Understanding how species adapt to new environments is a central goal in evolutionary biology, and a topical question in climate change research. Here, we sequenced the genomes of 426 individuals of the perennial, Arctic-alpine herb Arabis alpina to study demography and adaptation, with a focus on populations in Northern Spain, that experience warm and dry summers. Our inference supports a scenario in which A. alpina colonized Northern Spain in a range expansion event that started near the Alps around 216 thousand years ago (kya). During the last glacial episode (115 to 12 kya), this expansion proceeded Westward, and effective population sizes were large across Europe, likely due to a larger suitable habitat for A. alpina. These ancient demographic events gave rise to a highly diverged genetic lineage in Northern Spain. In the present interglacial (between 12 kya and present), populations became increasingly fragmented, and lost genetic diversity across Europe. Furthermore, we detected signatures of selection at genes associated with responses to abiotic stress, including drought stress, and regulation of growth, for instance at SC5D and NAC055, which reflects the climatic changes since the last glacial period. Notably, an ancient polymorphism at the gene FRL1 emerged as a candidate for conferring variation in flowering behavior, and for contributing to adaptation to drought. Our study suggests that the combination of ancestral variation in flowering behavior, and positive selection on new mutations involved in drought responses, underlies the evolution of a new trait syndrome, and adaptation to climate change.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

We analyzed the publicly available Comprehensive Autoimmune Disorder Dataset (synthetic; n=176), including 85 SS patients (38 RF-positive, 45 RF-negative) and 91 RA patients. Four autoantibodies: anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), and anti-Smith (anti-Sm).

Among these factors, the role of supercoiling in modulating DNA radiosensitivity remains controversial, with the existing literature being inconclusive on its effective contribution. Here, we characterize the linearization of a supercoiled DNA minicircle by double-strand breaks (i.e., the rupture of the covalent DNA backbone on both complementary strands of the double helix) via classical coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, and verify how the initial supercoiling regime of the molecule influences the kinetics of the rupturing process. We observe that the excess torsional stress overall enhances the rupturing likelihood but in one specific scenario -- associated with a biologically-significant level of (negative) superhelical density: This effect highlights a strong asymmetry between positive and negative supercoiling regimes and provides critical insights on the role of topology on the radiosensitivity of DNA molecules.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Concurrent FLMMs enable testing of how the photometry signal is associated with, for example, a behavioral variable that evolves across within-trial timepoints (e.g. animal speed). cFLMMs can also model the relationship between the photometry signal and covariates in experiments with variable trial lengths (e.g., in studies where trials end when an animal responds).

By integrating these data with annotations for CTCF binding sites, transcription start sites, and promoters, we identified 23,640 unique, high-confidence regulatory loops. These loops are distributed throughout the genome and provide a foundational resource for investigating gene regulation and the genetic architecture of complex traits in rat models.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

The genomic foundation model Evo2 demonstrates remarkable capabilities in decoding DNA functional patterns through cross-species pretraining. However, despite the great potential of Evo2 in basic genomics research, there is currently no clear and systematic guidance on its specific application scenarios, performance, and optimization directions in the field of tumor genomics, and its performance dependency on specialized hardware (such as FP8 precision on H800 GPUs) has not been empirically benchmarked. Here, we present a focused validation of Evo2 using two independent cancer genomic datasets (Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma and Ovarian Cancer), we tested the downstream tasks of Evo2, including the prediction of tumor pathogenic variants and the prediction of mutational effects, and compared its performance on A100 and H800 GPUs. The results show that critical importance of FP8 precision, enabling the H800 to achieve a 4x faster inference speed than the A100 with stable accuracy (AUC 0.88-0.95). The 7B-parameter model emerged as the top performer, whereas the 40B model experienced a severe performance drop (AUC to 0.48) on non-FP8 hardware like the A100. These findings empirically validated Evo2's hardware specifications and provided practical insights for researchers implementing the model with similar computational resources. Futhermore, our findings provide a framework for the application and optimization of downstream tasks of the DNA language model Evo2 in cancer, and can guide researchers in effectively applying it in genomic studies.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we apply a large-scale, low-coverage whole genome sequencing approach to the conservation genomics of the Swedish sand lizard (Lacerta agilis). Sand lizards occur in fragmented populations across Sweden, with varying population sizes and degrees of isolation, and face significant threats from habitat degradation and land use change. In this study, we sequenced 139 individuals to investigate genetic diversity, population structure and genetic load. We reveal strong population structure among Swedish sand lizards and identify populations with low genetic diversity and realised high genetic load. Genetic diversity in populations declined with increasing latitude, likely reflecting the historical northward expansion process and the subsequent population fragmentation and isolation. We observe strong population structure and reveal genetic distinctiveness of populations; findings with significant conservation implications. For example, the Sormon population, a relict population in central Sweden, appears genetically distinct from all other populations. Further, the northern-most populations in Dalarna appear relatively small, with high genetic load, and thus may require intensive management via e.g., restored open successional habitat to aid population recovery. Our study adds to the growing field of conservation genomics and demonstrates the value of high-resolution whole genome approaches to the conservation efforts for threatened populations. Finally, our research contributes crucial insights for the conservation management of this vulnerable species in Sweden.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Depletion of METTL3 or its binding partner METTL14 impairs ovarian cancer proliferation and tumor progression. Mechanistically, m6A deposition enhances the translation of DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, an epigenetic repressor that silences tumor suppressor genes. Pharmacologic inhibition of DNMT1 led to DNA hypomethylation and upregulation of the tumor suppressors TNFAIP3 and FBXO32.

It is critically dependent on ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), a mitochondrial reductase that facilitates cuproptosis by reducing ionophore-bound Cu(II) to Cu(I), which triggers its release, and by promoting mitochondrial protein lipoylation, which is directly targeted by the released Cu to drive cell death. Despite the pivotal role of FDX1 in cuproptosis, the structural determinants underlying its distinct functions remain unclear. To address this, we performed deep mutational scanning (DMS) of FDX1 and identified two conserved residues, D136 and D139, on -helix 3 that are critical for both FDX1-mediated lipoylation and cuproptosis. Charge-reversal mutations at these positions abolished FDX1 ability to support lipoylation and induce cuproptosis in cells, despite retaining full enzymatic activity in vitro. Guided by structural and genomic analyses, we further identified dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD), the E3 subunit of lipoylated complexes as an alternative FDX1 reductase both in cells and in vitro. Together, these findings establish -helix 3 of FDX1 as a critical interface for its upstream regulation and suggest that FDX1 roles in lipoylation and cuproptosis are both structurally and functionally linked.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Despite the coexistence of sexual and asexual species, the evolutionary mechanisms underlying their reproductive diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we present a global genomic survey of 249 Rhodotorula strains using Oxford Nanopore, PacBio, and Illumina sequencing. Phylogenomic analysis resolved a robust species tree, delineating three major clades with substantial cryptic species diversity. Chromosome-level assemblies revealed a constrained tetrapolar mating system characterized by unlinked pheromone/receptor (P/R) and homeodomain (HD) mating-type (MAT) loci but displaying infrequent recombination. This genomic architecture is widely conserved, even in species lacking observed sexual cycles, suggesting widespread sexual potential. The P/R locus functions as a supergene, exhibiting conserved gene content and order within mating types but variable configurations between compatible types. Clade-specific biases in mating-type allele distributions indicates asymmetric evolutionary pressures. Structural rearrangements and trans-specific polymorphism of mating-specific allele at the P/R locus, may drive sequence divergence, potentially generating novel mating compatibility within the same mating type. The intermediate P/R genomic states retaining pheromone genes from the opposite mating type may preserve residual functions or facilitate transitions in mating-type architecture. Together with the presence of homozygous hybrid strains, these genomic signatures suggest a potential shift toward same-sex-like mating. Our findings elucidate how mating-type architecture and allele dynamics underpin the evolution of reproductive strategies in fungi and suggest that innovations in MAT system may be a key evolutionary lever in fungal adaptation across environments.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

The local maize cultivar is characterized by extended maturity, tall stature, and presence of thick aerial roots that secrete an abundance of polysaccharide-rich root exudate, or mucilage, that is implicated in the recruitment of diazotrophic microbes to facilitate biological nitrogen fixation. Here we estimate the broad sense heritability of traits related to nitrogen fixation in a panel of Zea entries spanning pre-domestication, post-domestication and post-improvement, and identify QTL via F2:F3 families for traits including aerial root node counts and various other yield related traits (i.e. germination rate, time to reproductive maturity, total biomass and nitrogen content of shoot and grain). Across two separate field studies, aerial root node count (AR) demonstrates heritability of 64% and 73%, and genetic mapping reveals three distinct QTL distributed on chromosomes 1 and 9. Further, we report novel QTL for germination rate via stand counts after direct sowing (SC), Plant Total Nitrogen (PTN), Plant Dry Mass (PDM), and a joint QTL for Grain Total Nitrogen (GTN) and Grain Dry Mass (GDM). Finally, we identify overlap between QTL for multiple traits (including AR and SC) and regions of elevated introgression from wild Zea mays L. spp. mexicana (hereafter mexicana) into Totontepec maize, with a greater degree of overlap than expected under a uniform genomic distribution suggesting adaptive introgression from mexicana.

FA is caused by mutations in one of the 22 so-called FANC genes, with two thirds of FA patients being FANCA mutants. FANC proteins cooperate within the FANC/BRCA pathway, a DNA repair system essential for resolving DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in S-phase. The canonical understanding of FA pathogenesis involves genome instability and impaired cellular proliferation due to DNA damage accumulation and stress response overactivation. However, recent data shows FANCA has a function in ribosome biogenesis and translation, which prompts a reassessment of FANCA's role(s) in cellular physiology and FA pathogenesis. We reasoned that unveiling the multiple interactions of the FANCA protein would shed light on these potentially new FANCA functions. By combining immunoprecipitation and BioID approaches, in three different cell lines and with different in silico analysis methods, we constructed lists of FANCA interactome proteins of different levels of selectivity and assembled them into a novel multilayered FANCA protein-protein interaction (PPI) landscape. Strikingly, we find that FANCA associates with proteins involved in processes distinct from DNA repair, such as translation, ribosome biogenesis, mRNA splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, chromatin remodeling, and the TCA cycle. We then analyzed the protein content of polysome profiling fractions and found that FANCA loss may affect ribosomal protein stoichiometry within ribosomal subunits. Overall, our data expands FANCA's PPI network far beyond the previously reported interactions. Importantly, we confirm the biological significance of low-selectivity interactions and propose to re-evaluate their importance in proteomic studies. The study of previously unsuspected FANCA functions, such as translation, could provide new therapeutic targets in FA and therefore improve patient care.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Crop and pasture plants can readily take up and accumulate PFAS in their tissues, which eventually ends up in food products or livestock feed and presents health issues. We investigated whether arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the soil affect plant PFAS uptake in three important cereal crop species (barley, bread wheat, durum wheat), using a combination of soils that were artificially-spiked or naturally contaminated with PFAS. Spiking soil with PFAS did not interfere with AM colonisation of roots, nor did it detrimentally affect plant biomass. However, the shoots of all three plant species accumulated high concentrations of multiple short- and long-chain PFAS compounds. Inoculation with AM fungi led to increased concentration of all measured PFAS compounds in durum wheat shoots and several compounds in barley shoots, with no effect on any compounds in bread wheat shoots. The effect of AM fungal colonisation on PFAS concentrations in cereal plants is highly dependent on the nature of the soil PFAS contamination (i.e., the concentration and speciation) and the host plant species. It remains to be investigated whether AM fungi can directly take up PFAS from the soil.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

This stress is counteracted by mitochondrial metabolism, which requires extensive metabolic reprogramming to sustain survival under carbon-limited conditions. Although lysine metabolism has been associated with energy homeostasis, its specific function under prolonged carbon deprivation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the lysine-biosynthesis mutant dapat exhibits premature senescence and accelerated mortality under an 8h/16h light /dark cycle, whereas it survives under a 12h/12h photoperiod. This suggests a critical dependence on carbon reserves accumulated prior to darkness exposure. Under short-day conditions, dapat plants displayed a pronounced decline in photosystem II efficiency (Fv/Fm), chlorophyll degradation, decreased total protein content and increased levels of free amino acids. Transcriptional analysis of genes encoding amino acid catabolic enzymes, alternative respiratory components, and markers of senescence, starvation, and autophagy revealed a constitutive priming response prior to stress induction. This response was further intensified under carbon-limitation, indicating severe metabolic reprogramming. Notably, growth under a 12h light /12h dark cycle prior to darkness exposure enabled dapat plants to recover following extended darkness. They exhibited a distinctive recovery profile and maintenance of the metabolic reprogramming signature intrinsic to the DAPAT mutation. Collectively, our findings indicate that lysine biosynthesis plays an important role in the coordination of cellular energy status and stress response.

Incorporating gene editing into breeding programs is critical to improve yield and stress tolerance, yet wheat remains difficult to transform and regenerate efficiently. These bottlenecks limit the full application of CRISPR/Cas9 for improving yield in wheat. To address this, transformation parameters were optimized for three methods: immature embryo transformation, callus transformation, and injection-based in planta transformation. Systematic optimization of Agrobacterium strain, bacterial density, acetosyringone concentration, and incubation conditions resulted in substantially improved transformation success. Efficiencies of 66.84% for immature embryos, 55.44% for callus, and 33.33% for in planta transformation were achieved, representing more than tenfold increase compared with previously reported rate of ~3%. A key innovation was the shortening of the callus induction stage for immature embryos, reducing the time required for plant regeneration by approximately one month while maintaining high transformation efficiency. The protocols were validated through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of TaARE1-D, a negative regulator of nitrogen uptake and yield. Generated mutants exhibited increased grain number, spike length, grain length, and thousand-grain weight, as well as the characteristic stay-green phenotype associated with loss of TaARE1-D function.

Six wheat genotypes with a range of cool temperature and photoperiod sensitivities were evaluated. Apical development, final leaf number (FLN) and temporal expression of Vrn1, Vrn2 and Vrn3 were compared with model predictions. There was a clear relationship between FLN responses to cool temperature and photoperiod, the timing of phenological events and the patterns of Vrn gene expression for all genotypes. There was general agreement between the temporal patterns of foliar gene expression observed with those assumed by CAMP, but some obvious discrepancies. These may be related to differences between gene expression in foliar (observed) and apical (assumed by the model) parts of the plant, or differences in the way observed and modelled gene expression are scaled. Overall, the model described all the observed development responses to environment and provides a basis for building quantitative predictions of field-based development from genotypic and environmental data.

Whether such intrinsic self-repair is sufficient to preserve microtubule integrity during dynamic molecular-motor induced buckling, which frequently occurs in cells, remains unclear. Here, we show that kinesin- driven microtubule buckling in vitro induces severe lattice damage, leading to extensive tubulin incorporation. In many cases, however, the damage exceeds the microtubules' capacity for self-repair, resulting in breakage. In contrast, microtubules survive continuous buckling substantially longer in the presence of intracellular factors.

The alternative complement pathway (AP) of the innate immune system is overactivated in HSCT-TMA, but the mechanisms of its initiation are poorly described. Complement component C3 of the AP can be cleaved by proteases outside of the AP. Because mRNA expression of tissue kallikrein 1 (KLK1), an inflammatory serine protease that produces kinins, has been found to be markedly elevated in the renal endothelium of inflamed mice, we hypothesized that increased KLK1 activity during inflammation contributes to AP overactivation and endothelial injury in HSCT-TMA. We assessed AP activation, KLK1 activity, endothelial injury, and renal function in HSCT-TMA experimental models and disease settings and investigated C3 cleavage and AP activation by KLK1. We found that patients with HSCT-TMA had significantly increased AP activation and decreased KLK1 inactivation at TMA diagnosis compared to pre-HSCT. Mice challenged with HSCT-TMA triggers cyclosporine A (CsA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exhibited increased AP activation, renal endothelial injury, and impaired renal function in the setting of decreased KLK1 inactivation. We further demonstrated that KLK1 cleaved AP component C3 to C3b that functionally activated the AP. Our data indicate a noncanonical mechanism for AP activation by KLK1 in settings of HSCT-TMA.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Their well-defined active sites make them particularly amenable to inhibition by small molecules, underscoring their druggability. The Leishmania kinome, shaped by diverse evolutionary processes, harbours a unique repertoire of potential drug targets. Here, we used the cysteine-directed protein kinase probe SM1-71 to identify four essential protein kinases MPK4, MPK5, MPK7 and AEK1 as candidates for covalent kinase inhibitor development, as well as CLK1/CLK2 for which covalent inhibitors have already been identified. We leveraged the absence of natural analog-sensitive (AS) kinases in L. mexicana to establish an in vivo chemical-genetic AS kinase platform for investigating essential functions of protein kinases. Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated precision genome editing, we endogenously engineered two kinetochore-associated protein kinases, KKT2 and KKT3, and cyclin-dependent kinase CRK9, to generate AS kinases. We show that KKT2 and CRK9 kinase activities are essential for both promastigote and intracellular amastigote survival; KKT2 kinase activity being required for progression through mitosis at a stage preceding mitotic spindle assembly, while CRK9 kinase activity is required for S phase, consistent with its role in trans-splicing. This study demonstrates the utility of AS chemical genetics in Leishmania and identifies KKT2 and CRK9 as having critical roles in Leishmania cell cycle regulation and therefore being promising drug targets.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Here we present a workflow which effectively bypasses this step, by obtaining initial particle orientations directly from heterogeneous ab initio reconstruction in CryoSPARC solely using data at high spatial frequencies. Applying this approach, we solve the structure of a previously intractable protein in a publicly available dataset, iPKAc (EMPIAR-10252), 39 kDa, resolved at an estimated resolution of 2.7 A as well as a hemoglobin alpha-beta dimer (EMPIAR-10250) at 29kDa, resolved to an estimated resolution of 4 A. We also show that the Aca2-RNA complex (37kDa, EMPIAR-11918) can be resolved by this approach directly from a blob-picked particle stack, in a single round of heterogeneous ab initio reconstruction followed by local refinement. The map of iPKAc is of sufficient quality to autobuild 325 of 356 residues present in the original crystal structure using Modelangelo, and ordered ATP and magnesium ions can clearly be resolved. The Hb-dimer has clear secondary structural features, identifiable hemes, and visible bulky sidechains, consistent with the estimated resolution.

We found that standard deviation and total variation of the phase are inversely related to the cellular Young's modulus, while the total variation of phase has finer mechanical resolution. Integrating the total variation of phase with cell segmentation algorithms, we efficiently analyzed the cellular Young's modulus for cells in a monolayer. Using this system, we found the cells at the wound frontier are much softer than that of the cells in the inner region of monolayer in in vitro wound healing assay. At single cellular level, the Young's modulus of leader cells, boundary cells, and inner cells are significantly distinct from each other.

However, due to the opacity and structural complexity of soil, how physical constraints imposed by pore geometry influence bacterial motility and chemotactic recruitment to plant roots remains poorly understood. We use a transparent soil mimic composed of cryolite grains that replicate the structural characteristics of natural soils while enabling direct visualization of bacterial dynamics. Using Escherichia coli as a model bacterium, we combine macroscopic spreading assays with microscopic tracking of cellular trajectories to characterize how soil texture affects motility across pore scales. We find that bacterial motility shifts from run-and-tumble behavior in large, open pores to frequent trapping in smaller, more confined spaces. This transition is governed by the pore size distribution and leads to reduced effective diffusivity and slower population-scale spreading. Moreover, pore-scale confinement hinders the chemotactic recruitment of bacteria to Arabidopsis thaliana roots: recruitment is robust in sandy and loamy soils but negligible in highly confining textures. Our results establish soil texture as a critical factor regulating microbial dynamics and ecological interactions in the rhizosphere. This mechanistic understanding complements genomic surveys by identifying physical confinement as an ecological filter that shapes root-associated microbiomes. These findings highlight the essential and previously underappreciated role of soil texture, suggesting new strategies for managing microbial communities to promote plant health and sustainable agriculture.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Current methods often inflate the cortical surface into a sphere and apply the spherical heat kernel, introducing distortions to density estimation. In this study, we propose a novel approach using the Riemannian diffusion kernel derived from the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the cortical surface to smooth streamline endpoints into a continuous density. Our method inherently accounts for the complex geometry of the cortical surface and exhibits computational efficiency, even with dense tractography datasets.

{"title": "Optimizing Electrotactile Stimulation Parameters for Responses Under Cognitive Load", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.08.674827", "authors": "Jarto, F.; Corbett, E. A.; Dupan, S.", "abstract": "Background: Prosthetic users mainly rely on their vision for feedback during control of the device in absence of the tactile and proprioceptive modalities. Overreliance on vision increases cognitive load during prosthesis use, resulting in reduced control performance. Provision of additional feedback through other modalities could reduce this overreliance on vision and improve closed-loop prosthetic control. Fast and accurate recognition of feedback is particularly important when we consider that both delays and inaccuracies can destabilize closed-loop control environments. Transcutaneous electrotactile stimulation is a promising technology with advantages including non-invasiveness and simplicity. It is not yet clear, however, which parameters influence the speed and accuracy of response to electrotactile stimuli. In this study, we set out to investigate how we can influence response characteristics to an instantaneous change in stimulation intensity by manipulating both stimulus-related and environmental variables. Methods: 20 participants completed a randomized reaction time test to both visual and electrotactile stimulation. Participants were asked to respond to incoming stimuli with a button press on a controller as fast as possible, without discriminating between modality of stimulation. In a second experiment, 20 participants completed an intensity discrimination task for electrotactile stimulation. Participants had to prioritize either speed or accuracy during specific blocks, while cognitive load, magnitude of intensity shift and direction of shift were manipulated. Results: The results of the reaction time experiment confirmed lower average response times for electrotactile stimuli compared to visual stimuli by a median of ~50ms (p=0.008). In the intensity discrimination experiment, increased shift intensities led to increased response accuracies and decreased response times (p<0.001 in both cases). The presence of cognitive load increased average response times (p=0.005), but did not affect response accuracies (p=0.420). Conclusions: The results of the intensity discrimination experiment imply that the magnitude of intensity shift needs to be provided via steps multiple times larger than the just noticeable difference to ensure fast and accurate responses to electrotactile stimulation. Moreover, results from the reaction time experiment confirmed faster average response times for electrotactile stimuli over visual stimuli. We argue that providing electrotactile stimulation using bigger steps in perceived intensity could result in the supplementary feedback making closed-loop control of prosthetic devices more reliable.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Prominent theories propose that stimuli are encoded in either stable and persistent activity patterns configured through attractor mechanisms or dynamic and time-varying activity patterns brought about through functionally-feedforward network architectures. However, cortical circuits exhibit heterogeneous responses during WM tasks that are challenging to reconcile with either hypothesis. We hypothesised that these complex response dynamics could emerge from an optimally noise-robust and energetically efficient solution to WM tasks. We show that, in contrast to previous theories, networks optimised for efficient WM encoding exhibit high-dimensional rotational dynamics. We find direct evidence for these rotational dynamics in large-scale recordings from monkey prefrontal cortex.

We conducted a sham-controlled multimodal study to examine the effects of low-intensity (0.375 mA) bifrontal tDCS at rest in healthy adult males. The tDCS, with the anode placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the cathode over the right DLPFC, was applied for twelve minutes, and outcomes were measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for cortical hemodynamics and connectivity, heart rate variability (HRV), photoplethysmography (PPG) for autonomic function, and subjective surveys for emotional stress. The results showed that, compared to sham, active tDCS produced a decrease in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentration in the left DLPFC during stimulation, indicating reduced cortical oxygenation in the stimulated region. Functional connectivity analysis of fNIRS signals further revealed altered network connectivity, including modulation of intra- and inter-frontal connections, in the tDCS condition relative to sham. Concurrently, tDCS induced an increase in HRV indices such as RMSSD, SDNN, pNN50, SD1 and SD2, reflecting enhanced parasympathetic activity and autonomic regulation. Participants in the active tDCS group also reported selective reductions in both state and trait anger after stimulation, whereas the sham group showed minimal changes in mood. These findings demonstrate that even at a subthreshold intensity, bifrontal tDCS at rest engaged neurovascular and neurovisceral mechanisms, coupling changes in prefrontal cortical activity with autonomic outflow and mood. This study provides new evidence of cortical-autonomic coupling during neuromodulation and suggests that low-intensity frontal tDCS may promote a calm physiological and emotional state. The results have implications for future research on brain stimulation in emotion regulation and for developing neuromodulation-based interventions to improve autonomic balance and mood in both healthy individuals and clinical populations.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

AlphaFold2-guided mutagenesis supports a direct interaction between these molecules. Functional investigations show that the PHC1 domain is required for efficient recruitment to active Rho, and that it plays a role in the transduction of Rho activity to Myosin II activation.

While mechanistic understanding is limited, the mitotic transcriptome is known to be generally preserved to allow the daughter cells an economical and efficient start. We used highly effective cell cycle synchronization to specifically characterize mitotic hnRNPC, an abundant nuclear RNA-binding protein known for intron binding and splicing regulation during interphase. Two density-distinct hnRNPC-RNP populations (low-and high-density; LD and HD) were identified in mitotic cells. RNA-seq analysis combined with fluorescent Cross Linking and Immuno-Precipitation (fCLIP) revealed hnRNPC binding to 17.1% and 8.7% of expressed genes in LD- and HD-complexes, respectively, with most sites mapping to protein-coding genes (77% and 68%, respectively). Mediated by its known cooperative interaction with U-rich motifs, mitotic hnRNPC acquired prevalent interactions with exons, predominantly within the 3' untranslated region of mature mRNAs. Mitotic hnRNPC also retained intron interactions, predominantly in LD-hnRNPC RNPs, which comigrated with both the spliceosome and mono-ribosomes through a density gradient. Interestingly, LD-hnRNPC also interacted with mature mRNAs characterized by short coding sequences, in agreement with mono-ribosome loading. Conversely, HD-hnRNPC, which co-migrated with poly-ribosomes, predominantly interacted with mature mRNA complexes. Downregulation of hnRNPC elicited a global negative effect on the abundance of its mitotic targets. The data points to the global role of mitotic hnRNPC as a stabilizer of pre-mRNA and mRNA.

In metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes--conditions characterized by adipocyte dysfunction--patients often exhibit worsened outcomes following viral infections.

Here, we demonstrate that healthy adipocytes secrete factors that confer antiviral protection to neighboring cells. We developed a fully human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived system including adipocytes, immune, and vascular cells to evaluate the antiviral capacity and infectivity of various cell types. Our cell system has the advantage of being of human origin, as opposed to animal models. Through our technological development, we have removed cell culture medium as a variable by adapting all cell types to a single base medium. We found that only adipocytes could induce an antiviral state in adjacent mural and immune cells. This unique immunomodulatory capacity is mediated, at least in part, by the STING-dependent secretion of low levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-) from healthy adipocytes. Notably, pharmacological induction of metabolic dysfunction in adipocytes diminished their antiviral activity, revealing a previously unrecognized link between metabolic health and antiviral defense. These findings identify a novel role for adipocytes in orchestrating local antiviral responses and provide new insight into how metabolic dysfunction may compromise host defense during viral infections.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Contractions near the cell edge drive highly dynamic cell shape changes during cell migration and contraction pulses in central cell attachment areas are involved in mechanotransduction. Previously, we identified a signal network in adherent mammalian cells, that generates mechanosensitive contraction pulses, in which the cell contraction regulator Rho is controlled by fast positive feedback amplification via GEF-H1, and by a slow negative feedback that depends on actomyosin activity. However, the precise mechanism of this negative feedback in adherent cells, in particular if it is mediated via actin or Myosin-based components, was still unclear. Here, using numerical simulations of this system, we predicted that the cell contraction signal network dynamics are strongly inhibited both by inhibition and by constitutive activation of the actomyosin component Myosin-II. We confirmed these predictions experimentally by direct inhibition of Myosin-II and by activation via constitutively active ROCK1. Furthermore, constitutive activation of Myosin-II leads to an accumulation of Myosin-II next to the nuclei which spatially correlated with a corresponding shift of Rho activity dynamics from the cell center to the cell edge, showing that constant Myosin activation can spatially restrict cell contraction dynamics. Finally, light-induced rapid recruitment of ROCK1 to the plasma membrane strongly activated and recruited Myosin-II, and at the same time depleted Actin and inhibited Rho activity at the plasma membrane. We conclude that negative feedback in the cell contraction signal network of adherent mammalian cells is mediated by Myosin-II, and that actin does not act as the predominant inhibitor in this system.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Classically, motor proteins have been thought to function as Diligent Workers (DW) that remain attached to cargo during the entire transport event and are degraded at the end of the journey. In contrast, previous work suggests that kinesin-1 transport can be described by a Loose Bucket Brigade (LBB) model in which individual motor proteins participate in multiple rounds of transport. Here, we used live-cell imaging in iNeurons to test whether the kinesin-3 KIF1A functions as a DW during axonal transport. We demonstrate that the fluorescence intensity of KIF1A on particles undergoing axonal transport does not change over time, suggesting that KIF1A remains attached to its cargo for the entire transport event. We determined that KIF1A has a relatively short protein half-life, suggesting that KIF1A is degraded at the end of the journey. Moreover, protein turnover appears to be tightly controlled in iNeurons, as treating cells with proteasome inhibitors results in a cessation of KIF1A-driven transport and degradation of the KIF1A aggregates through autophagy.

Amiloride treatment and mutation of an extracellular tryptophan (W74) in PANX1 abolished ATP-evoked cell area enlargement, suggesting that PANX1 may itself regulate this form of macropinocytosis. Transient expression of the GTP-hydrolysis resistant ADP-ribosylation factor 6 GTPase (ARF6 Q67L) led to increased cell size, PANX1 internalization and localization to endosomal compartments, consistent with macropinocytosis. Inhibiting macropinocytosis-associated GTPases, phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), and disrupting actin polymerization abolished ATP-induced PANX1 internalization supporting a macropinocytic mechanism. Further, these inhibitors disrupted co-distribution of intracellular PANX1 with macropinosomal cargo. Several lipid-PANX1 interactions were identified with relevance to macropinocytic mechanisms.

Here, we investigate the roles of C. elegans DUO-1, an ortholog of mammalian ubiquitin-specific proteases USP26 and USP29, in mediating these dynamic chromosomal events during meiotic prophase. Cytological analyses of duo-1 null mutants indicate that loss of DUO-1 function leads to impaired assembly of synaptonemal complexes (SCs), loss of integrity of meiotic chromosome axes, ineffective homolog pairing, premature separation of sister chromatids, and late-prophase chromosome decompaction. Further, SC instability in duo-1 mutants correlates with depletion of REC-8 cohesin complexes and is accompanied by massive accumulation of early DSB repair intermediates. By using a dual-AID-tagged allele to deplete DUO-1 during meiotic development, we demonstrate that DUO-1 is continually required throughout meiotic prophase progression, to promote proper axis/SC assembly in early prophase, to maintain axis/SC stability during the late pachytene stage, and to promote/maintain chromosome compaction at the end of meiotic prophase.

Limited-proteolysis showed minor cleavage differences between wild-type (WT) and phosphomimetic Np, but no major structure or stability changes in the N- and C-terminal domains were observed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and differential scanning fluorimetry, respectively.

WT Np also compacted and irreversibly bound single-stranded DNA; this activity was significantly reduced by phosphorylation. These mechanistic insights support a model where phosphorylated Np functions in RNA replication and chaperoning, while non-phosphorylated Np facilitates genomic RNA packaging.

P.", "abstract": "Mound-building termites construct massive structures from soil. These structures contain intricate, interconnected passageways linking multiple chambers and atria, which house the brood and fungus gardens that support wood digestion, while also enabling efficient movement of termites. Remarkably, the major and minor workers who build these structures in their dark, subterranean milieu lack image-forming eyes. Coordinated construction on such a scale requires close communication among thousands of individuals. How do termites communicate and coordinate their activity within the mound? Previous studies have shown that communication between termites is mediated by a range of pheromones. A prominent hypothesis, the stigmergy hypothesis, suggests that termites communicate with their nestmates indirectly, by embedding chemical signals in the soil. We developed a choice assay to measure termite attraction to soil containing termite-deposited cues, offering a choice between soil from a repair site and unprocessed control soil. Using physical and chemical extraction methods, we removed volatile and non-volatile components and then measured termite attraction to the treated soils. In these experiments, termites preferred soil from their own mound's repair site over surrounding soil, indicating the presence of embedded pheromones. Of these, the non-volatile components could elicit responses to soil preserved for long periods of time. When extracted and added exogenously, these pheromones made unprocessed soil attractive to termites. Major and minor workers responded to volatile and non-volatile cues differently, indicating caste-specific responses to pheromones. These data show that termites use soil as a medium for communication, consistent with the stigmergy hypothesis.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

M.; Davis, K.; Mosalmanzadeh, N.; Schmitt, B. L.; Pence, B. D.", "abstract": "Background: Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a hyperinflammatory state associated with an exacerbated inflammatory activation of monocytes and macrophages in the respiratory tract. Metformin has been identified as a potent monocyte inflammatory suppressor, and it has been demonstrated to attenuate inflammation in COVID-19. The mechanisms underlying metformin anti-inflammatory effects are, however, unclear. We thus sought to investigate metformin's main interactions and their respective isolated effects in modulating monocyte inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 stimulation. Methods: Classical human monocytes were isolated from healthy 18-40-year-old individuals and stimulated in vitro with recombinant spike protein subunit 1 (rS1) to assess glycolytic and oxidative metabolic responses by Seahorse extracellular flux analysis, and inflammatory gene expression by qPCR. Stimulated monocytes were either pre-treated with metformin, rotenone, S1QEL, or A769662. Results: Monocytes stimulated in vitro with rS1 showed an increased glycolytic response associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Metformin pre-treatment reduced glycolytic activation while partially suppressing inflammation. Rotenone-dependent mitochondrial complex I inhibition was not able to replicate the same effect, and neither complex I specific ROS scavenging. Conversely, A769662 induced AMPK activation led to suppressed glycolytic inflammatory response and cytokine expression pattern similar to metformin, thus suggesting AMPK modulation as a possible central component for metformin's mode of action upon S1 stimulation. Conclusions: In summary, further investigation into the interactions underlying AMPK activity on monocytes in the context of SARS-CoV-2 may provide a better elucidation of metformin's anti-inflammatory effect.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

However, the extent to which these models accurately mimic the biological environments they represent remains poorly understood. A quantitative framework was recently introduced to assess how well laboratory models capture microbial physiology in situ. However, applications of this framework have been limited to characterizing the physiology of a single species in human infections, leaving a gap in our understanding of overall microbial community physiology in polymicrobial contexts. Here, we extended this framework to evaluate the accuracy of laboratory model systems in capturing community-level functions in polymicrobial infections. As a proof of concept, we applied the extended framework to a polymicrobial model of human chronic wounds (CW) infection. CWs harbor metabolically diverse bacterial species that engage in a range of microbe-microbe interactions, ultimately impacting community dynamics and disease progression. However, studies on the mechanistic drivers of chronic wound infection have relied on single species or pairwise approaches. Here, we demonstrate that our adapted framework can be used to develop accurate polymicrobial models. Further, we demonstrate that this extended framework can be used to evaluate the occurrence of known microbe-microbe interactions. Building on our prior work in large-scale metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis, we propose a highly accurate 6-member synthetic bacterial community model that is representative of the taxonomic and functional complexity of human CW infections.

However, due to heterogeneous methodologies, its effects on the gut microbiome, an emerging regulator of ageing and health, remain poorly defined. Here, we systematically assessed these effects in mice using a harmonised meta-analysis workflow, reprocessing raw sequence data end-to-end. We conducted a harmonised meta-analysis of the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon data from three independent mouse studies (n = 54) spanning dietary and intraperitoneal rapamycin interventions with matched controls. All samples were uniformly processed using a standardised 16S rRNA bioinformatics workflow. Genus-level abundances were modelled using two complementary approaches: a per-study zero-inflated beta modelling framework with random-effects meta-analysis, and a batch-corrected linear modelling framework incorporating correction prior to meta-analysis. Dose-response meta-regression assessed whether rapamycin-associated changes scaled with dose (42-990 mg/kg), integrating presence and magnitude of effects across heterogeneous study designs. Rapamycin treatment induced reproducible shifts in specific taxa across studies, with a subset of core responders consistently altered regardless of dose. Among the core responders, Bacteroides increased (OR = 1.59, q = 0.042) and Muribaculum decreased (OR = 0.55, q = 0.042), each significant in both frameworks. Whereas Ruminococcus decreased (OR = 0.60, q = 0.089), it was significant in the batch-corrected framework, but only a trend in zero-inflated modelling. Dose-sensitivity analyses highlighted Lachnospiraceae as the most consistent dose-sensitive taxon, with other associations largely restricted to extreme doses. Functional pathway analysis revealed alterations in energy metabolism and microbial stress response. This harmonised meta-analysis highlights notable shifts in the gut microbiome connected to rapamycin across the examined studies, outlining potential core microbial signatures.

SRRM2 is essential for nuclear speckle formation and a constitutive member of the RNA splicing machinery. To investigate how the mutation in SRRM2 contributed to the ALS pathogenesis, we examined its effect on a model cell line, where the point mutation was introduced in the endogenous gene. Surprisingly, we found that the resulting single amino acid exchange led to the loss of one protein-protein interaction, between SRRM2 and the splicing factor ACIN1. Transcriptome studies further revealed wide-spread differential gene expression, which converged on the dysregulation of synapse-associated pathways.

Recently, several P. falciparum alleles (termed Pfsa+) were found to be enriched in HbS carriers with malaria, suggesting that parasites may be evolving to overcome HbS protection. However, it is unclear whether HbS places selective pressure on parasites since it has little to no effect against asymptomatic parasitemia, which accounts for the majority of infections. Here, we consider the effect of sickle cell status on Pfsa genotype in asymptomatic infections among 2,277 children in a high malaria transmission region of Cameroon. Consistent with previous studies, we found no significant difference in asymptomatic infection rate according to HbS status. However, HbS was strongly associated with parasite genotype at both Pfsa loci tested. Strong linkage disequilibrium and evidence for within-infection competition further support selection for Pfsa+ alleles in HbS carriers. Our findings reveal that distinct parasites underlie the equal infection rates of HbS and non-HbS carriers, such that HbS has a protective effect prior to malaria symptoms against Pfsa- parasites and Pfsa+ alleles may contribute to HbS carriers' lower conversion rate to symptomatic disease. A revised evolutionary model for HbS protection against malarial disease is needed involving both resistance and tolerance and ongoing co-evolution with P. falciparum parasites.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

To enhance our basic understanding of PTX-induced effects we undertook a molecular/genetic dissection of PTX-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity. Larvae fed viable doses of PTX exhibited dose-dependent hypersensitivity to sub-noxious thermal stimuli. Hypersensitivity developed rapidly and did not completely resolve at the larval stage. Live imaging of peripheral thermal nociceptors showed that lower doses of PTX (< 10 M) caused hyper-sprouting of tertiary dendritic branches. At 10 M and above, dendritic beading was observed. PTX-induced hypersensitivity does not depend on signaling pathways previously implicated in acute injury-induced nociceptive sensitization. However, the insulin-like peptide 4 (ILP4), was required for PTX-induced thermal hypersensitivity at 10 M PTX. Surprisingly, RNAi targeting the insulin receptor (InR) in nociceptors increased PTX-induced hypersensitivity, suggesting that ILP4 does not activate InR in this context. The salivary gland is likely the primary tissue source of functional ILP4. ILP4 mutant larvae did not exhibit PTX-induced beading (10 M) but did exhibit hypersprouting at lower PTX concentrations. In summary, our model of PTX-induced hypersensitivity reveals a disconnect between hypersensitivity and neuronal morphology and a genetic separation of ILP4 and InR in PTX-induced hypersensitivity.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

While short-read (SR) sequencing has enabled broad insights at gene-level diversity, the inherently limited read length constrains the reconstruction of complete genomes. Conversely, HiFi-LR sequencing enhances the quality and completeness of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), enabling higher-resolution taxonomic and functional annotation. However, the cost and relatively low throughput of HiFi-LR sequencing can limit genome recovery, particularly at the binning stage, where coverage depth is critical. Results: Here, we present a novel hybrid strategy that differs from classical hybrid assemblies, where SR and LR reads are jointly used at the assembly step. Instead, we use high-depth SR data to improve the binning of HiFi-LR contigs. Using both SR and HiFi-LR metagenomic data generated from a tunnel-cultivated soil sample, we demonstrate that SR-derived coverage information significantly improves the binning of HiFi-LR assemblies. This results in a substantial increase in the number and quality of recovered MAGs compared to using HiFi-LR data alone and an uncomparable improvement compared to SR data alone. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the power of combining SR and LR in highly diverse environments, such as soil, not for hybrid assembly per se, but to enhance the downstream binning process. The combination of SR and LR data substantially improves the downstream binning process and overall genome recovery. Importantly, this approach underscores the potential of leveraging the vast amount of publicly available Illumina metagenomic datasets.

Mechanistically, tumors secrete Unpaired ligands that activate Jak/Stat signaling in corpora cardiaca (cc) cells, inducing the expression and protein levels of glucagon-like hormone Adipokinetic hormone (Akh).

Targeting tumor metabolism, particularly oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), has emerged as a promising approach due its role in melanoma tumor survival, metastasis, and treatment resistance. In this study, we investigate the metabolic and antitumor effects of atovaquone, an FDA-approved and safe OXPHOS inhibitor that has not been previously tested in melanoma. We show that atovaquone rapidly and effectively inhibits OXPHOS and impairs glycolysis in melanoma, leading to metabolic reprogramming observed via metabolic imaging and marked depletion in energy (ATP) stores. Atovaquone also induces oxidative stress, evidenced by increased reactive oxygen species levels, DNA damage, and upregulation of antioxidant proteins. Moreover, atovaquone reduced melanoma cell viability and migration in vitro, and slowed tumor growth in vivo. Notably, these effects were observed in both BRAF-wild-type and mutant melanoma models, suggesting its potential as an effective treatment across different subtypes. Our study identifies atovaquone as a metabolic disruptor with antitumor activity against melanoma, supporting further investigation as a repurposed therapeutic strategy.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

M.; Riminucci, M.", "abstract": "Bone fragility and pain are major clinical issues in fibrous dysplasia (FD) of bone, a genetic disorder characterized by increased bone resorption and lytic lesions. Both bisphosphonates (BPs) and denosumab are currently used to treat FD patients, although important concerns remain unsolved. BPs downregulate bone remodeling but their effects on FD lesions and pain are variable. Contrarily, denosumab converts FD tissue into mineralized bone and prevents disease progression, but disease rebound occurs upon treatment withdrawal. The combination of these two drugs may represent an effective and safe strategy for FD treatment. We used a FD mouse model (EF1-GsR201C) to assess whether zoledronate (ZOL) addition to anti-RANKL antibody (RANKL) treatment could preserve the effects of RANKL inhibition after treatment discontinuation. We show that RANKL treatment rapidly reduced bone turnover markers (BTMs) and increased bone mass in affected skeletal segments, but FD lesions recurred shortly after discontinuation. Importantly, RANKL+ZOL combination delayed disease rebound after RANKL withdrawal, as bone density was preserved, BTMs rise was prevented, and no new lesions were observed. ZOL monotreatment increased bone density and reduced BTMs but did not fully halt disease progression. Finally, both RANKL and RANKL+ZOL treatments reduced fracture incidence and ameliorated pain-like behavior in FD mice. These results demonstrate that combining zoledronate with denosumab may effectively treat FD. This strategy could particularly benefit patients with severe, rapidly progressive disease, in which RANKL inhibition would block lesion expansion and reduce bone turnover, while zoledronate would slow down the resumption of the disease and the rebound effect.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular mechanism of TAS1R3 function in islet {beta}-cells and skeletal muscle to control glucose homeostasis remains unknown. Objective: We questioned whether activation of endogenous TAS1R3 in human islets or clonal human {beta}-cells or human skeletal muscle cells are necessary for glucose stimulated insulin secretion and insulin stimulated glucose uptake respectively via activation of small GTPases. Methods and Results: We found that pharmacological TAS1R3 inhibition (lactisole) in human islets and a human {beta}-cell line diminished glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, attenuated Src family tyrosine kinase signaling, and small GTPase Cdc42 activation. In human skeletal muscle cell lines, lactisole treatment reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and impaired small GTPase Rac1-dependent non-canonical insulin signaling. We excluded the requirement for the G protein Gq/11 in TAS1R3 signaling by using the Gq/11-specific YM-254890 inhibitor in {beta}-cells and skeletal muscle. Notably, the significant reduction of TAS1R3 mRNA and protein levels in human type 2 diabetes pancreatic islets and skeletal muscle, reductions which could be replicated in otherwise healthy cells exposed to diabetogenic stimuli, indicates that the TAS1R3 deficit may be a consequence of diabetogenic stimuli.

Collectively, these peptides ensure that physiology (e.g., fat storage, fluid balance) and behavior (e.g., feeding, sleep) are coordinated with environmental factors such as nutrient quantity and quality. Despite notable sex differences in physiology and behavior, it remains unclear whether the regulation and function of these EE cell-derived factors is shared between males and females. Given that recent data identified sex-biased physiological effects of two EE cell-derived hormones on Drosophila food intake and energy mobilization, we performed a detailed characterization of these hormones in male and female flies. Despite an overall male bias in mRNA levels of AstA, AstC, Tk, NPF, Dh31 in the whole body and head, we observed a strong female bias in mRNA levels of AstC, Tk, and NPF in the gut. To determine whether this sex-biased regulation was physiologically significant, we monitored triglyceride levels in flies with gut-specific loss of EE cell-derived hormones. In 5-day-old flies, loss of either EE cell-derived AstC or Tk reduced fat storage in females with no effect in males. These female-specific effects on fat storage were reproduced in flies with neuron-specific loss of the AstC (AstC-R2) and Tk receptors (TkR99D). Together, these data uncover strongly sex-biased regulation of EE cell-derived hormones, and show that gut-specific loss of two of these hormones had a female-specific effect on body fat.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

In this study, we employed comprehensive transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to dissect the defence responses of barley heads during infection with Fusarium culmorum. Our analyses revealed a set of significantly regulated gene-protein pairs linked to biosynthetic pathways that consistently correspond to upregulated defence-related metabolites.

To facilitate its genetic transformation, a hyperosmotic electroporation protocol was optimized using cell wall weakening agents, achieving efficiencies comparable to other recalcitrant bacilli. A comprehensive and reusable genetic toolkit was developed centred on a temperature-sensitive E. coli - S. clausii shuttle vector (pM4B522), specifically engineered for compatibility with Golden Gate assembly. The plasmid backbone includes a spectinomycin resistance marker and an integrated red fluorescent protein reporter for transformants selection. A removable AmilCP chromoprotein cassette streamlines the assembly process by enabling blue/white screening in E. coli. This platform has demonstrated its versatility in genome editing for both S. clausii and Bacillus subtilis, as evidenced by its use in several applications: (i) sequential, markerless deletions of the non-essential catabolic genes xylA and lacA in S. clausii DSM 8716, with a success rate exceeding 60%; (ii) replacement of the lacA coding sequence with a GFP coding sequence, resulting in fluorescence induction in lactose-supplemented medium; (iii) introduction of a single-base substitution generating a premature stop codon in lacA, showcasing scar-free point mutagenesis; and (iv) transfer of the system to B. subtilis 168, highlighting its broader applicability across Gram-positive bacteria.

FPTT integrates multi-spectral monomeric fluorescent proteins with self-assembling protein fibers, enabling massively parallel analysis of signaling dynamics under varying cellular conditions.

The molecular mechanisms governing this plasticity remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify the conserved microRNA, miR-9a, as a critical regulator of this process. We show that miR-9a mutant females exhibit a premature rejection phenotype, mimicking mated-female behavior, which is correlated with an aberrant overgrowth of adult body wall sensory neurons. We demonstrate that this neuronal phenotype is governed by a dual regulatory system. First, in a non-cell autonomous mechanism, miR-9a expression in the epidermis is required to constrain sensory neuron dendrite growth, indicating that an epithelial-derived signal patterns the underlying neuron. Second, within the neuron itself, miR-9a interacts genetically with the transcription factor senseless (sens) and the novel RNA-binding protein bruno2 (bru2). Reducing the dosage of either sens or bru2 rescues both the neuronal and behavioral defects of miR-9a mutants. Our findings reveal an integrated, inter-tissue signaling axis where epithelial miR-9a orchestrates a non-cell autonomous cue that modulates a cell-intrinsic network to ensure the precise development of sensory neurons, thereby calibrating behavioral responses critical for reproductive success.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

We recently showed that blocking endocytosis in glia increases sleep and report here that this block is associated with an increase in peroxidized lipids and glial lipid droplet accumulation, raising the possibility that accumulation of these lipids increases the need to sleep. Sleep gain induced by blocking glial transport is exaggerated by knockout of the lipid droplet coat protein, Lipid Storage Droplet 2 (Lsd2), suggesting that sleep-promoting lipids are not contained in lipid droplets. To identify lipids regulated by sleep state, we performed global, targeted lipidomics analysis on Drosophila neurons and glia, screening nearly 3,000 lipids across 11 major classes. This revealed that sex influences lipid composition in both cell types and lipid homeostasis following extended wakefulness. Female neurons and glia are enriched in ultra-long chain fatty acids, triacylglycerols, and diacylglycerols, with glial diacylglycerol enrichment correlating with elevated sleep need. Based on manipulations of neutral lipid metabolic pathways, we propose that monoacylglycerols, products of glial diacylglycerol catabolism, promote sleep.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that FTLD-tau inhibits plasticity by blocking activity-dependent protein synthesis in dendrites. In the plasticity-associated translatome, we identified a subset of downregulated translated mRNAs in FTLD-tau neurons that encode postsynaptic plasticity regulators. Protein synthesis was blocked by FTLD-tau binding to eIF4B which caused eIF4B dissociation from the translation initiation complex and reduced dendritic eIF4B levels.

This protein, comprising over 2.000 amino acids, contains an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a capping domain, and a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in methylating the cap structure. The MTase domain features a conserved K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad -typical of 2 'O-methyltransferases- which is essential for methylating viral mRNA caps at both the N7 and 2 ' O positions. However, the role of these residues in other epitranscriptomic modifications of rabies virus (RABV) RNAs remains poorly characterized. To further explore the role of mRNA cap methylation in the immune evasion strategies of RABV, we investigated the functional contribution of the K-D-K-E motif within the MTase domain, using the Thai isolate as a model. Using reverse genetics, we demonstrated that the mutation K1830R in the K-D-K-E tetrad of the Tha MTase domain induces changes in the methylation landscape of viral mRNAs and, intriguingly, of host mRNAs. In addition, viruses harbouring the K1830R mutation are more sensitive to interferon  and exhibit a less pathogenic phenotype in vitro and in vivo compared to the wild-type virus. Overall, these results suggest that the regulation of viral and cellular RNA methylation landscapes plays a crucial role in controlling RABV infection.

Euglena gracilis (Euglena) is an emerging platform for the industrial production of various metabolites, including lipids. However, a comprehensive understanding of Euglena fatty acid biosynthesis pathways remains incomplete, posing a significant barrier to the commercialization of Euglena bioproducts. To address this gap, we employed a bioinformatics approach to identify a Euglena gracilis FAD12 (Eg FAD12). We analyzed the evolutionary relationship of Eg FAD12 with its homologs from other organisms and revealed that the three canonical histidine box motifs are conserved among FAD12s. To characterize EgFAD12, we cloned it into the pEAQ-hyperstrans vector and overexpressed it in Nicotiana benthamiana to take advantage of its endogenous fatty acid pool, which could act as substrates. The heterologous expression of FAD12 in N. benthamiana led to an increased linoleic acid content, demonstrating the suspected desaturase activity. To further confirm the function of Eg FAD12, we performed CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of Eg FAD12 in Euglena, which resulted in a drastic reduction in linoleic acid (C18:2) without compromising biomass yield or lipid content. This work advances our understanding of fatty acid biosynthesis in Euglena and will aid in its adoption as a platform for producing customized lipids.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

In freshwater systems, impacts are often indirect, driven by changes in the surrounding landscape that alter flow, chemistry, and connectivity. Using species-level abundance data from 163 studies across 6 biological groups, we examined how urban, agricultural, and forestry land uses affect freshwater biodiversity at local and regional scales. All three land-use types reduced species richness and altered relative abundance structure compared to natural vegetation, with urban systems showing the strongest and most consistent declines. Only urbanization was associated with biotic homogenization, particularly among abundant species. Biodiversity responses to land-use change also varied with latitude and taxonomic group: tropical assemblages tended to differentiate across sites, while homogenization was more common at higher latitudes. Macroinvertebrates and fish showed the strongest overall declines. These findings challenge assumptions of generality across ecosystems and highlight the need to explicitly incorporate freshwater biodiversity into global change research and policy.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

While parasitoids play essential ecosystem roles, limited knowledge is available about their shifting functional strategies. Here we focus on parasitoid bristle flies (Diptera: Tachinidae) to investigate the relationship between larval vs adult functional strategies. We retrieved trait data for 767 European species and defined functional trait spaces for larvae and adults. We then measured both functional distinctiveness (rarity in functional trait combination) and specialisation (variety of resources consumed). We found little correspondence in the functional distinctiveness of adults and larvae, with highly distinct larvae generating either functionally distinct or functionally common adults. In contrast, only specialised larvae (attacking a limited number of hosts) give origin to specialised adults (feeding on a limited number of flowers). This suggests selective pressure towards specialisation might act synergistically across life stages, if trophic resources are restricted in space for both the larva (e.g. caterpillar host) and adult (e.g. flowers). Global change can generate complex patterns of functional homogenisation in parasitoids, which can occur at different (or both) life stages and lead to ecosystem-wide consequences: from the outbreak of herbivore insects to the loss of pollination capacity.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we report on a genetic variant in the ESD species, Daphnia pulex, in which structural variations and selection on chromosome have suppressed recombination. This suppression has facilitated the accumulation of antagonistic features of the two chromosome- haplotypes, resulting in heterozygosity and differentiation of the sex-determining gene Dfh on two haplotypes. Consequently, this process has driven the emergence of a mixed-mating system, in which sex determination is jointly regulated by genetic and environmental factors. Additionally, we detected ongoing divergence in chromosomal structure between the two haplotypes at the population level.

The persistence of high levels of genetic variation in the presence of genetic drift and directional selection has long puzzled evolutionary biologists. Recent studies suggest that antagonistic pleiotropy may play a greater role than previously appreciated, highlighting the need for more empirical studies that consider both sexual antagonism and life-history trade-offs. Here, we performed a comprehensive assessment of fitness trade-offs within and between sexes in an extensively monitored natural population of Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens). We found significant additive genetic variance for female fitness and identified several loci associated with variation in survival, fecundity, and lifetime reproductive success. Many loci associated with multiple fitness components had antagonistic effects, particularly within males. Considering genome-wide polygenic effects, we found multiple genetic trade-offs both within and between sexes, especially when considering different fitness components between sexes. Comparing allele frequency trajectories for putatively pleiotropic loci demonstrated that antagonistic SNPs had smaller allele frequency changes than concordant SNPs. Our fine-scale dissection of fitness components reveals substantial antagonistic pleiotropy that affects short-term evolution, highlighting the importance of antagonistic selection in maintaining genetic variation over short time scales in nature.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Two missense variants in CDK19, Y32H and T196A, were first proposed to be dominant negative in nature based on experiments in a Drosophila model. Subsequently, another group proposed that Y32H is a gain of function based on elevated kinase activity. We present a detailed evaluation of the activity and functionality of these dominant variants in several contexts in fly models of DEE-87 in which endogenous cdk8, the fly ortholog of human CDK8 and CDK19, is knocked down while we overexpressed the human genes. Depletion of Drosophila cdk8 causes thicker muscle myofibrils, fused mitochondria, and climbing defects. The expression of human CDK19WT in a fly cdk8-RNAi background rescues these defects, highlighting functional conservation. To investigate functional differences between the variants, we compared effects of variants to expression of wildtype CDK19. Ubiquitous expression of Y32H can rescue the cdk8 knockdown phenotype through a gain of function compensatory effect, while T196A is unable to do so through a possible reduction in kinase activity. We found that supplementation of the antioxidant drug, N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA), rescues phenotypes of only the T196A adult flies, illustrating a divergence in variant functionality. Our studies in flies allowed us to assay these variants in numerous contexts to gain further insight into their mechanism and obtain translational knowledge to apply back to human health.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and kinematic assessments to explore how these areas influence reaching performance in neurologically intact adults. Participants performed a reaching task using the KINARM exoskeleton robot. Brief TMS pulse trains were initiated before movement onset to perturb cortical activity at subthreshold and suprathreshold intensities targeting bilateral PMd, PMv, and PPC. Subthreshold stimulation of contralateral PMd and PMv reduced reach efficiency and smoothness, while suprathreshold stimulation of contralateral PPC increased deviation error and reduced smoothness. Among ipsilateral targets, PMd showed consistent TMS-induced effects, and was the only target where resting-state connectivity predicted behavioral response. Stronger interhemispheric connectivity in the primary motor cortex and weaker interhemispheric PPC connectivity were associated with greater reductions in straightness and smoothness during subthreshold ipsilateral PMd stimulation.

It is feasible that data from a given patient, or even all data from a given institution, does not have coverage across all modalities; the available data is contingent on both the assay choice at the institution alongside technical aspects and associated drop-out. Consequently, algorithms for machine learning models must be tolerant to structured data missingness (or occurrence) for entire modalities when training. In this paper, we compare general strategies for training multimodal models in the context of structured modality missingness, employing suitable strategies for the stage of modality integration: early by concatenation of features, intermediate by max pooling of latent features, and late by aggregating model predictions probabilistically. We evaluate our strategies on a real world bioinformatics dataset for the task of breast cancer subtyping, constructing a range of structured missingness scenarios. We highlight that, despite their inability to learn cross-modality interactions, late integration models outperform against early and intermediate integration strategies across a range of scenarios according to the level and nature of missingness. Logistic regression models, although simple, also outperform neural networks within the same settings. Fundamentally, we show that understanding the structure of missingness within a dataset is necessary when selecting a method of integration, and that simple models and approaches should not be dismissed when working with structured missingness.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

The adenylate cyclase (CyaA) toxin is a major virulence factor of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough. CyaA is produced as an inactive precursor, proCyaA, which is activated by acylation of two lysine residues within the bacterium. Once acylated and secreted, CyaA invades innate immune cells and disrupts their phagocytic functions. High-resolution structural characterization of CyaA has remained elusive due to its size, multi-domain organization, flexibility, and aggregation propensity. Here, we overcome these challenges and generate the first structural ensembles of both non-acylated and acylated CyaA in solution by combining experimental data with integrative modeling. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that acylation is critical to stabilize the native fold and to favorably orient CyaA on the target membrane.

Remarkably, transformed keratinocytes within a cSCC retain some ability to execute the terminal differentiation program that typically generates a stratified epidermis. Instead of the polarized stratification towards the body surface seen in normal epidermis, cSCC keratinocytes differentiate concentrically inward to produce keratin pearls. It is well appreciated that cSCC differentiation status is correlated with degree of local invasion and potential for distant metastasis, with well differentiated tumors having a better prognosis. While molecular mechanisms that govern the differentiation process are incompletely understood, identifying candidate molecules associated with cSCC differentiation can provide new histologic markers for prognostic stratification. Here we demonstrate that Flower (FWE), a newly described regulator of lamellar body (LB) trafficking in normal epidermis, is specifically expressed within differentiated layers of cSCC. Genetic knockout of the hFWE gene dysregulates cornification and LB-related gene expression leading to abnormal keratinization patterns, while ectopic hFWE4 expression drives G1-arrest and exit from the proliferative basal keratinocyte population. Additionally, we find that poorly differentiated keratinocyte regions of human cSCC exhibit minimal FWE-positivity, while this population is readily detectable in well-differentiated regions.

Among the diversity of mineral pigments, iron oxide pigments represent a widely-used class, because of their technical qualities, diversity of shades (from yellow to red to brown to black) and low toxicity compared to heavy metals-based pigments. However, a low toxicity does not mean the absence of adverse effects. We thus investigated the effects on macrophages of two different subtypes of Pigment Red 101, i.e. hematite, produced by two different processes, namely a wet precipitation process and a calcination process. Macrophages were chosen as a target cell type because they represent the main scavenger cell type that is in charge of handling particulate materials in the body. During this comparison, we realized that the calcined pigment was contaminated from the start by bacterial endotoxins, which induced intense inflammatory responses and biased the comparison. After depyrogenation, the calcined pigment proved to dissolve to a higher extent in macrophages, but to show less important adverse effects (e.g. alteration of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses) than the precipitated pigment in a recovery exposure mode, allowing to investigate delayed effects of the pigments. Thus, despite their identical pigment number, pigments differing in their structure and in their synthesis induce different responses from living cells, even if administrated in equivalent amount.

One metabolite at the plasma membrane where RGS1 resides is UDP-glucose (UDPG) produced by SUCROSE SYNTHASE (SUS) enzymes, previously shown to interact with RGS1. Our direct measurements indicate that the KD for UDPG binding to RGS1 (2.4 M) is consistent with UDPG activation of RGS1 with an EC50 of 17 M to rapidly trigger G protein activation, Ca2+ signal, and MPK6 activity within minutes. RGS1 associates directly with SUS1 and SUS4, exhibiting affinities (KD = 161 nM and 106 nM, respectively) that are markedly tighter than the corresponding Km values for UDPG formation (40 M and 70 M, respectively). SUS thus may be one source for this RGS1 ligand in a manner analogous to metabolite funneling in enzymology.

Previous research has primarily examined these principles under carbon-limited conditions, demonstrating how microbes optimize their proteomic resources to balance metabolic efficiency and growth rates. This study extends this thermodynamic framework to explore microbial metabolism under various non-carbon nutrient limitations (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur). By integrating literature data from a range of species it is shown that growth under anabolic nutrient limitations consistently results in more negative Gibbs free energy ({triangleup}G) values for the Net Catabolic Reaction (NCR), when normalized per unit of biomass formed, compared to carbon-limited scenarios. The findings suggest three, potentially complementary hypotheses: 1. the Proteome Allocation Hypothesis, microbes favour faster (higher kcat) enzymes to reduce proteome fraction used for catabolism, thus freeing proteome resources for additional nutrient transporters; 2. Coupled Transport Contribution Hypothesis: The more negative {triangleup}G of the NCR may in part stem from the increased reliance on ATP-coupled or energetically driven transport mechanisms for nutrient uptake under limitation; 3. Bioenergetic Efficiency Hypothesis: microbes prefer pathways with more negative {triangleup}G to enhance cellular energy status to support nutrient uptake under anabolic limitations.

While previous studies have shown that features such as calories and naturalness are encoded by the visual brain, it remains unclear how this encoding is shaped by the observer's current state. In this study, we explore the effect of 1) hunger state, 2) current individual preference, and 3) task relevance on the processing of visual food information. Participants underwent two EEG sessions: one after fasting overnight and the another after eating normally. We used multivariate decoding methods to assess the impact of hunger on the decoding of edibility and food identity, and Representational Similarity Analysis to determine the time-course of information related to food flavour, personal appeal, and arousal, both when participants attended to the stimuli and when their attention was distracted away. Results showed that the visual brain quickly encodes information about edibility and food identity, and this was not influenced by whether the participants were in a fasted or sated state. Information about the flavour profile was found to be represented regardless of attentive state. Personal appeal and arousal information emerged later and were only observed when the food was task relevant. Using RSA, we found that food appeal and arousal encoding was more closely aligned with behavioural ratings within rather than between sessions, suggesting the nature of the encoding was driven by current state. In conclusion, the study provides insights into how personal preferences and physiological states influence the representation of food information in the brain.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

The molecular mechanisms regulating capsule expression to rapidly adapt to these distinct niches are unknown. Here, we show that high frequency mutations in a poly-G repeat in the regulator of mucoid phenotype gene, rmpA, mediates reversible ON/OFF phase variation of the mucoid phenotype. We find that these mutations generate subpopulations of bacteria with reduced capsule expression and mucoidy. In vitro and in vivo infection models reveal that phase variation to the OFF state facilitates epithelial cell infection while ON switching enhances resistance to the bactericidal activity of human serum and systemic spread to the liver and spleen in a murine infection model. Genomic analysis reveals that the phase variation mechanism is a conserved feature of all HVKp and that additional novel DNA repeats in rmpD and rmpC drive different combinations of capsule mucoidy and hyperexpression phenotypes. These findings establish a mechanistic basis for how HVKp occupy such a diverse array of niches during infection, with important implications for the design and implementation of Kp-specific vaccines and therapies.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

P.; Ros, C.", "abstract": "Parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a prevalent human pathogen that can cross the placenta by a mechanism that remains unknown, posing a risk of severe fetal complications, particularly during the first trimester of pregnancy. We investigated the expression of B19V-specific receptors in the three trophoblast cell types, cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs), and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), and assessed their susceptibility to infection. VP1uR, the erythroid-specific receptor that mediates viral uptake and infection in erythroid progenitor cells, is expressed in CTBs and STBs, but not in EVTs. Globoside, a glycosphingolipid that is essential for the escape of the virus from endosomes, is also expressed in these cells, except for choriocarcinoma-derived CTBs. In the latter, the absence of globoside can be overcome by promoting endosomal leakage with polyethyleneimine. While erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) signaling is associated with the strict erythroid tropism of B19V, it is not required for infection in trophoblasts. Transfection experiments revealed that highly proliferative first-trimester CTBs are more permissive to B19V infection than the low-proliferative CTBs from term placenta. These findings demonstrate that B19V targets and infects specific trophoblast cells, where viral entry and replication are collectively mediated by VP1uR, globoside, and high cellular proliferative activity, but are independent of EpoR signaling.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Loss of MNL1 elevated cAMP levels and activated the PKA pathway, linking Mnl1 to growth control and stress responses. Additionally, mnl1 cells exhibited altered sphingolipid composition, implicating Mnl1 in regulating membrane permeability, a key determinant of drug efflux and membrane integrity. Increased tolerance in mnl1 cells was also linked to increased mitochondrial function.

Don) is a major plantation species in Japan, but its abundant pollen production is a primary cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis (pollinosis). To mitigate this public health issue, the use of male-sterile cultivars has been promoted. Five types of recessive male-sterile mutations (ms1 to ms5) have been identified, and the causal genes and mutations for MS1 and MS4 have been elucidated. However, the gene responsible for MS2-type male sterility remains unknown. Results: We aimed to identify the candidate gene responsible for MS2-type male sterility using a map-based cloning strategy. High-resolution linkage mapping localized the MS2 locus to a 1.56 cM interval on linkage group 5, corresponding to an 8.64 Mb region of the reference genome. Ninety-one genes in this region were subjected to functional annotation, gene expression analysis, and mutation screening. Among these, a single gene, SUGI_0493010, encoding a GDSL-type esterase/lipase protein (GELP), fulfilled all three criteria: it showed homology to pollen development genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, was specifically expressed in male strobili, and carried a deleterious amino acid substitution (S40F) within the predicted catalytic domain in ms2 mutant. The same mutation was also detected in a heterozygous individual (Ms2/ms2) from a separate breeding population, whose genotype was confirmed through progeny testing. Structural annotation revealed that the affected serine residue lies within the conserved GDSL motif, suggesting a functional disruption of enzymatic activity. Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that SUGI_0493010 (GELP) is the causal gene for MS2-type male sterility in C. japonica. This finding enhances our understanding of male sterility mechanisms in conifers and provides a valuable genetic resource for breeding pollen-free trees.

This platform achieves near-baseline separation of KA and KAL directly from microbial biomass, with parallel reaction monitoring-PASEF (PRM-PASEF) enhancing signal-to-noise for isomeric product ratio analysis. Using this workflow, we screened a 318-variant DsKabC/GfKabC DNA shuffle library in under 30 minutes, identifying seven variants with improved KAL conversion. Two variants showed a near-complete shift toward KAL production with greater substrate consumption, while retaining favorable expression profiles compared to GfKabC. These results establish MALDI-TIMS-MS as a generalizable platform for high-throughput isomeric product screening and provides new kainoid synthase variants to probe structure-function relationships for further development as biocatalysts.

On the one hand, graph-based regulatory network models rely on prior knowledge but are constrained by unknown kinetic parameters. On the other hand, recent advancements in single-cell sequencing technologies, particularly RNA velocity and pseudotime analysis, offer data-driven approaches to infer kinetic parameters. However, accurate modeling of biological dynamics requires the estimation of the Jacobian matrix, which captures signal propagation within a regulatory system. Several computational methods have recently emerged to infer Jacobians from single-cell data, including SpliceJAC, scMomentum, and Dynamo. Here, we evaluate these methods by analyzing Jacobian eigenvalues, assessing their ability to capture stability and oscillatory properties. Using simulated ground truth data, we find that all methods are susceptible to data quality, rendering them unreliable under real-world conditions. In conclusion, beyond improvements in data quality, there is a critical need to develop more robust computational methods for estimating Jacobians from single-cell data.

Using high-throughput measurements and predictive modeling, we show that nucleosomal DNA is distinguished not only by enhanced isotropic bendability but by coherent anisotropic bending aligned with the DNA helical repeat. Within nucleosome footprints, anisotropy vectors are phase-aligned across thousands of sequences, yielding ensemble-level signatures, such as ~15 full rotations of bending direction, that directly mirror histone:DNA wrapping. We show that within nucleosomes, reinforcement of bending direction every helical repeat pre-disposes DNA to wrap smoothly around histones, lowering the energetic cost of nucleosome formation. Extending these principles to coding regions, we demonstrate that synonymous codon usage bias varies systematically around nucleosomes in a manner that optimizes DNA mechanical and structural features around nucleosomes and suggest that degeneracy of the genetic code has been exploited to encode both proteins and chromatin architecture. Together, our findings establish DNA anisotropy as a pervasive, sequence-encoded feature of nucleosomal DNA and identify codon usage as a key contributor to this hidden mechanical code.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

However, analyses of early colorectal cancer lesions suggest that tumors may instead originate from multiple, genetically distinct cell populations. Detecting polyclonal tumor initiation is challenging in patients, as it requires profiling early-stage lesions before clonal sweeps obscure diversity. To investigate this, we analyzed normal colorectal mucosa, benign and dysplastic premalignant polyps, and malignant adenocarcinomas (127 samples) from six individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Individuals with FAP have a germline heterozygous APC mutation, predisposing them to colorectal cancer and numerous premalignant polyps by early adulthood. Whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequencing revealed that many premalignant polyps- 40% with benign histology and 28% with dysplasia-were composed of multiple genetic lineages that diverged early, consistent with polyclonal origins. This conclusion was reinforced by whole-genome sequencing of single crypts from multiple polyps in additional patients which showed limited sharing of mutations among crypts within the same lesion. In some cases, multiple distinct APC mutations co-existed in different lineages of a single polyp, consistent with polyclonality. These findings reshape our understanding of early neoplastic events, demonstrating that tumor initiation can arise from the convergence of diverse mutant clones. They also suggest that cell-intrinsic growth advantages alone may not fully explain tumor initiation, highlighting the importance of microenvironmental and tissue-level factors in early cancer evolution.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

TET2 loss is also associated with augmented inflammation, as well as impaired innate immune responses. However, many individuals harboring mutations do not develop hematologic disorders, indicating that additional factors, such as inflammation, cooperate with TET2 loss to promote disease progression. Innate immune memory is a phenomenon in which pre-treatment with microbial ligands, including monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), improves innate immune function while minimizing inflammation during subsequent infection. Given the previously reported innate immune impairments attributed to TET2 loss, we tested whether MPLA could induce an innate immune response in TET2-deficient mice infected with P. aeruginosa. Moreover, due to the inflammatory role of TET2 loss, we investigated whether MPLA with infection would promote disease-related phenotypes. We found that TET2-deficient mice display impaired infection response to P. aeruginosa which is partially improved with MPLA pretreatment. Assessments of pathogenic clearance functions further showed decreased capacity in TET2-deficient innate immune cells. Moreover, TET2-defcient cells also exhibit impaired differentiation. MPLA pretreatment in infected mice promotes myeloid-biased hematopoiesis at the expense of erythroid- and megakaryocyte-biased hematopoiesis, resembling MDS-like disease progression. Intriguingly, inhibition of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) dampens the effects of TET2 loss on hematopoietic perturbation. Collectively, we find that TET2 loss impairs innate immune memory and infection responses, and MPLA with infection promotes hematopoietic skewing through RIPK1.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

Although life-threatening fasting hypoglycemia can be controlled by a strict diet, patients often suffer from multiple metabolic abnormalities and severe long-term complications. However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, and the lack of effective monitoring biomarkers makes it a challenge to treat patients. Therefore, the aims of this study are to investigate the pathological mechanisms of the disease and disease complications in GSD I and identify potential protein biomarkers. Methods: In this study, we employed comprehensive untargeted proteomics on stored samples: 26 serum or plasma samples from 18 GSD Ia and 8 GSD Ib patients with 21 matched control sera, complemented by 4 liver samples from 2 GSD Ia patients who received liver transplantation (from the one patient with hepatocellular carcinoma we obtained tissue from both the carcinoma tissue and the adjacent non-carcinoma tissue), and 1 from a GSD Ib patient, compared to 10 donor liver samples. Results: We identified a total of 415 proteins in our analyses. Pathway analysis of the differentially regulated proteins revealed distinct changes in serum/plasma of GSD Ia and Ib. The coagulation pathway was the most significantly changed biological process in the GSD Ia patients. Immune response-associated proteins, especially a large number of immunoglobulins, were increased in GSD Ib specifically. Proteins related to liver injury, cholesterol, and amyloidosis were altered in two subtypes, though more pronounced in GSD Ia.

In many animals, social isolation increases aggression, courtship, locomotion, and feeding while disrupting sleep. This occurs when peripheral neurons detect social signals, such as pheromones, which activate decision-making circuits in the brain. However, the molecular and circuit mechanisms of how chronic social isolation or enrichment alter gene expression and affect neuronal function and behavior remain unclear. In this study, we examined how transcription patterns and chromatin marks in male Drosophila brains change in response to social experience, and the impact of pheromone circuits and transcription factors involved in social circuit function. We focused on pheromone receptors Or47b and Or67d, as well as transcription factors FruM and DsxM. Our findings suggest that social experience impacts multiple genes in the central brain. Disrupting Or47b, Or67d, FruM, and DsxM function normalized the transcriptional responses through antagonistic interactions. Specifically, Or47b circuits predominantly mediated transcriptional responses to social isolation through DsxM function, while Or67d and FruM regulated responses to group housing. Notably, mutants of fruM and dsxM exhibited more extensive transcriptional changes in the brain than Or mutants, especially for FruM/DsxM target genes. While social experience did not lead to detectable alterations in the overall chromatin profile in the whole brain, mutants of the four genes resulted in significant changes in the enrichment of H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) compared to wild type. Furthermore, mutants in fruM and dsxM generally eliminated social experience-dependent changes in sleep and locomotion behaviors, whereas Or mutants exhibited more modest disruptions.

This paper finds evidence for preferentially focusing representational resources on the extremes of the distribution of visual inputs in a generative model as an alternative to the central tendency models that are commonly used for prototypes and exemplars. The notion of treating extrema near a decision boundary as features in visual recognition is not new, but a comprehensive statistical framework of recognition based on extrema has yet to emerge for category learning. Here we suggest that the statistical Extreme Value Theory provides such a framework. In Experiment 1, line segment stimuli that vary in a single dimension of length are used to assess how human subjects and statistical models assign category membership to a gap region between two categories shown as reference stimuli. A Weibull fit better predicts an observed human shift when moving from uniform to enriched or long tails as reference stimuli. In Experiment 2, more complex 2D rendered face sequences drawn from morphspaces are used as stimuli. Again, the Weibull fit better predicts an observed human shift when reference stimuli are sampled differently.

Genomic comparison between the variants was used to identify resistance-related mutations. Additionally, we analysed genomic differences among the three host strains, screening for anti-phage systems. Sequence analyses, PCR, and nuclease treatments of resistant host genomes and plasmids were used to assess the possibility of lysogeny and superinfection immunity. No single mutation or anti-phage system consistently explained FLiP resistance, as these varied across hosts. Resistant B114 contained FLiP genome in circular extrachromosomal dsDNA form, suggesting possible lysogeny. Surprisingly, we found that low quantities of FLiP sequences exist in bacterial populations not exposed to FLiP in the laboratory. This suggests that residing as extrachromosomal dsDNA elements in a small percentage of host cells may be a natural strategy for FLiP type phages to endure unfavourable conditions.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Identifying key drivers of pathogen infection prevalence and intensity in wildlife populations is essential to understand dispersal and transmission of disease. Calodium hepatica (syn. Capillaria hepatica) is a generalist nematode that infects liver parenchyma of mammal species worldwide and is capable of human infections. Parasite prevalence ranges from 0-100% in wildlife, often varying across small geographic areas, making it an ideal parasite for understanding ecological drivers of variation in prevalence. In this pilot study, we quantify prevalence of Calodium hepatica and present an initial survey of synanthropic small mammals in four villages representing areas of different land use and land cover. Cross-sectional rodent trapping was conducted within and around households over two consecutive dry seasons in Eastern Uganda. 18s rRNA gene of C. hepatica was amplified and a sub-set of PCR products sequenced to confirm presence of C. hepatica. Landscape structural diversity was classified by crown density (per pixel) and using mean canopy height (metres) derived from 30m resolution LiDAR data within a 0.5km buffer. Multivariable binomial generalised linear models were fit to C. hepatica prevalence. C. hepatica infection was common (overall 34.5%, CI95% 27.9-41.0) and found in many species of rodents and shrews inside and outside residences. We observe village-level differences in prevalence, between 18.2%-75.0%, with higher C. hepatica prevalence associated with higher relative proportion of Rattus rattus to other species (aOR=2.22 CI95% 1.30-3.85). Host diversity appears to be protective against parasite prevalence. Differences in molecular and macroscopy identification highlight challenges in diagnosis and a need for more specialized molecular tools. Further investigation is required to understand individual host and community variation in pathogen infection intensity and implications for zoonotic risk.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

However, how these traits evolve to allow adaptation to different environments remains poorly understood. Here, we explored this question in phage {Phi}X174, combining experimental evolution and mathematical modelling. By investigating how serial transfer conditions shape evolutionary outcomes in liquid culture, we found that the time between transfers imposes divergent selection on adsorption and context-dependent directional selection on persistence. Longer transfer intervals, which allow multiple infection cycles until host depletion, favoured fast-adsorbing, highly persistent mutants that could rapidly initiate infections and remained viable in the absence of the host. In contrast, shorter transfer intervals selected for slower adsorption without substantially altering persistence. Mathematical modelling of phage infection dynamics revealed that slow adsorption reduces the likelihood of irreversible phage attachment to already infected cells, thereby increasing the number of free phages able to initiate new infections upon dilution. These trade-offs resulted in distinct plaque phenotypes on solid media: fast adsorbers formed small plaques, while slow adsorbers formed large ones. A single-point mutation in the major capsid protein was sufficient to drive these changes in adsorption. In the case of fast-adsorbing mutants, this mutation was pleiotropic and also enhanced environmental persistence. Our findings show how simple changes in propagation conditions can steer phage phenotypes, providing insights relevant to evolutionary biology and phage therapy.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

A.; Chen, Y.; Qi, Y.; Guo, X.; Xia, Y.; Yang, W.", "abstract": "Toad-headed agama (genus Phrynocephalus) is a widely distributed group of lizards across Central Eurasia, inhabiting diverse arid and semi-arid environments from the Caspian Basin to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Despite considerable research efforts over the past decades, a robust phylogenetic framework for Phrynocephalus has remained elusive. In this study, we collected 26 samples representing a substantial portion of the distribution of this genus and established a well-supported phylogeny based on whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomic approaches. We found that the Phrynocephalus lizards comprised of three major clades, including the Western Asia, Central Asia and viviparous clades. Furthermore, we provided compelling evidence for an ancient hybridization event that led to the speciation of P. mystaceus, which likely contributed to the observed phylogenetic discordance across the genome. Divergence time estimation and ancestral area reconstruction indicated that Phrynocephalus lizards originated approximately 31.57 million years ago in the Central Asia and Iranian Plateau region, followed by Miocene dispersals into the Arabian Peninsula, the Gobi Desert, and the QTP. Our results illuminate how hybridization and historical range dynamics have jointly driven the origin and diversification of Phrynocephalus, providing new insights into the formation of biodiversity in Eurasia.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

The advent of long-read sequencing technologies opened up the possibility of sequencing full length transcripts. Most of the existing methods aims to predict isoforms at genome scale. However, solving all isoforms at genome scale is not always needed, mostly when one is interested in a single gene or a few genes. It also brings algorithmic constraints, encouraging the use of less accurate alignment algorithms and downgrading sensitivity of methods to determine the repertoire of isoforms. The aim of RNA-tailor is to make available an easy-to-use tool to perform single gene resolution of alternative splicing isoform repertoire with high accuracy. To leverage such precision, RNA-tailor uses a combination of exact alignment algorithm and context aware alignment corrections. By analyzing both real and simulated datasets, we show that RNA-tailor is able to achieve higher sensitivity.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

D.; Pavisic, J.; Wechsler-Reya, R.", "abstract": "Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a devastating pediatric brain tumor with an unmet need for novel therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have failed to prolong survival for DMG patients. In this study, we analyzed the expression of immune checkpoint molecules in human and murine DMG cells, as well as primary brain tumor samples, and identified CD155 as the most highly expressed. When murine DMG cells were co-cultured with CD8+ T cells, silencing of CD155 led to a marked increase in T cell-mediated killing. Strikingly, CD155-deficient DMG cells failed to grow in immunocompetent mice, and depletion of CD8+ T cells allowed these tumors to grow. CD155 also exerted cell-autonomous effects on tumor cells: silencing of CD155 led to induction of apoptosis of DMG cells and to delayed tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. Transcriptomic analyses identified FOXM1 as a key target of CD155. Notably, FOXM1 silencing also led to reduced proliferation of DMG cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally, treatment of DMG-bearing mice with Thiostrepton, a FOXM1-targeting agent, delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival. These studies demonstrate that CD155 regulates immune evasion and tumor growth in DMG, and suggest that targeting CD155 could be a valuable two-pronged therapeutic strategy for this disease.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

However, in Spain, the importance of sustainability in research is only starting to be recognised at a national level. We developed a scalable, visual-oriented communications strategy that was designed with input from scientific staff and included a live seminar and a coherent set of graphic materials. Five pillars were targeted: three key areas of consumption (energy, water, and plastic use), procurement, and colleague engagement. The scheme was piloted in two of the largest biomedical research centres in Spain: the Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Centre (CBM) and the Spanish National Centre for Biotechnology (CNB). The pilot engaged 50 laboratories and services across both centres, of which 34 were followed up for 5 months. The results indicate engagement with sustainability measures and shifts toward best practice across metrics, including equipment switch-off, water use, plastic item reuse, and purchasing decisions. During the follow-up period, 23% of participants adopted new measures related to freezer maintenance, decluttering, or sample organization, 55% removed old data from storage to save energy, 100% reduced their use of lifts, and 94% discussed research sustainability with their laboratory/group. The findings also revealed key areas for improvement, including the management of shared resources and resistance to change protocols.

A.; Diaz, A.", "abstract": "Echinococcus multilocularis, causing agent of alveolar echinococcosis, down-regulates host immunity 1,2. Salzmann et al showed that macrophages close to the parasite produce little IL-6 and the parasite extract mimics this inhibition in cultured macrophages 3. The authors then showed that E. multilocularis contains phytic acid and that commercial phytic acid inhibits cytokine responses in stimulated macrophages. Through comparison with effects of EDTA and intracellular calcium measurements, they concluded that phytic acid inhibits macrophage responses through calcium depletion, extrapolating this conclusion to assays with parasite extract and infection setting. However, the interaction between phytic acid and calcium is complex 4,5. Calcium is indeed depleted in the assays with commercial phytic acid according to our quantitative predictions. However additional changes occur including formation of solid calcium phytate, which probably moderates the inhibition of responses observed under calcium depletion. We calculate that in the experiments with parasite extract, phytic acid present cannot deplete calcium and therefore inhibition must be driven by a different mechanism, possibly independent of phytic acid. Further, we argue that calcium depletion is an unlikely in vivo immune regulatory mechanism. We propose that biological assays using calcium phytate are needed for ascertaining whether phytic acid has biologically relevant anti-inflammatory activity.", "date": "2025-09-12", "journal": ""}

However, their application in livestock farming remains limited, being constrained by several factors not least the availability, diversity and complexity of knowledge sources. This study introduces an intelligent knowledge assistant system designed to support health management in farmed goats. Leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), two structured knowledge processing methods - table textualization and decision-tree textualization were proposed to enhance large language models' (LLMs) understanding of heterogeneous data formats. Based on these methods, a domain-specific goat farming knowledge base was established to improve LLM's capacity for cross-scenario generalization. The knowledge base spans five key domains: Disease Prevention and Treatment, Nutrition Management, Rearing Management, Goat Milk Management, and Basic Farming Knowledge. Additionally, an online search module is integrated to enable real-time retrieval of up-to-date information. To evaluate system performance, six ablation experiments were conducted to examine the contribution of each component. The results demonstrated that heterogeneous knowledge fusion method achieved the best results, with mean accuracies of 87.90% on the validation set and 84.22% on the test set. Across the text-based, table-based, decision-tree based Q&A tasks, accuracy consistently exceeded 85%, validating the effectiveness of structured knowledge fusion within a modular design. Error analysis identified omission as the predominant error category, highlighting opportunities to further improve retrieval coverage and context integration.
