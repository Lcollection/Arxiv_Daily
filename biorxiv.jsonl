TMS delivered during the early stages of motion processing selectively impaired direction discrimination at both sites, while global motion perception remained unaffected. These behavioral effects were accompanied by a common local increase in BOLD activity, but distinct patterns of network reorganization.

Here, we analyzed twenty metatranscriptomes from a North Atlantic-Arctic environmental gradient considering ocean currents transport times. Functions related to the regulation of gene expression and cold acclimation were more abundant in Arctic metatranscriptomes. Using the PHATE dimensionality reduction algorithm, reconstructed transcriptomes of Bacillariophyta, Mamiellales, Pelagophyceae, and Phaeocystales revealed different gene expression patterns, including photosynthesis regulation. All groups showed upregulation of numerous key temperature-associated functions and a subset of shared functions, supporting a convergence in transcriptomic changes under polar conditions.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are essential for vessel repair and, via their secretome, can invade from the vessel media into the intima to mediate ECM remodelling. Accumulation of fibronectin (FN) is a hallmark of early vascular repair and atherosclerosis. Here we show that FN stimulates VSMCs to secrete small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) by activating the {beta}1 integrin/FAK/Src pathway as well as Arp2/3-dependent branching of the actin cytoskeleton. We found that sEVs are trapped by the ECM in vitro and colocalise with FN in symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. Functionally, ECM-trapped sEVs induced the formation of focal adhesions (FA) with enhanced pulling forces at the cellular periphery preventing cellular spreading and adhesion. Proteomic and GO pathway analysis revealed that VSMC-derived sEVs display a cell adhesion signature and are specifically enriched with collagen VI on the sEV surface. In vitro assays identified collagen VI as playing a key role in cell adhesion and invasion directionality. Taken together our data suggests that the accumulation of FN is a key early event in vessel repair acting to promote secretion of collage VI enriched sEVs by VSMCs. These sEVs stimulate directional invasion, most likely by triggering peripheral focal adhesion formation and actomyosin contraction to exert sufficient traction force to enable VSMC movement within the complex vascular ECM network.\n\nFigure AbstractVascular smooth muscle cells sense fibronectin via {beta}1 integrin and secrete small extracellular vesicles loaded with collagen VI. These extracellular vesicles are entrapped in the extracellular matrix and induce formation of peripheral focal adhesions presenting adhesion complex ECM proteins including collagen VI, LGALS3BP, EDIL3 and TGFBI. Focal adhesions anchor the extracellular matrix to actin fibrils in the cell. Contraction of the actin fibrils generates the mechanical force for directional cell invasion through the matrix.

Previous joint S-F studies of perisylvian development were mainly conducted on individual structural and functional metrics. By employing a weighted combination of metrics, joint S-F studies can enhance the understanding of perisylvian development in neonates, thereby providing valuable features for the prediction of neurodevelopmental disorders. To this end, we employed both structural and functional metrics derived from 16 perisylvian sub-regions (PSRs). Structural metrics included morphological and myelination measures, while functional metrics encompassed functional connectivity (FC) values between a designated seed PSR and the remaining PSRs. In addition, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) for all PSRs was computed and used as a distinct group of functional metrics. During statistical procedure, based on sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA), the structural metrics were correlated with each respective group of functional metrics. Then, CCA was employed to delineate regional interdependencies and derive combined structural-functional features. The findings revealed that combined features outperform individual metrics for characterizing the normal development of the PSRs in term neonates. The myelination is prominently related to both fALFF and FCs, while morphological metrics of the PSRs have very limited contribution in combined structural features. Among the designated PSRs, the FCs of both the right insula and Heschls gyrus with other PSRs demonstrated a more robust correlation with the combined structural features.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Although such mirror neurons have been thought to have highly congruent discharge during execution and observation, many if not most, show non-congruent activity. Studies of reaching movements, for which low-dimensional neural trajectories exhibit comparatively simple dynamical motifs, have shown that these prevalent patterns of co-modulation pass through subspaces which are shared in part, but in part are visited exclusively during either execution or observation. The neural dynamics of hand movements are more complex, however. We developed a novel approach to examine prevalent patterns of co-modulation during execution and observation of a task that involved reaching, grasping, and manipulation. Rather than following neural trajectories in subspaces that contain their entire time course, we identified time series of instantaneous subspaces, calculated principal angles among them, sampled trajectory segments at the times of selected behavioral events, and projected those segments into the time series of instantaneous subspaces. These instantaneous neural subspaces most often remained distinct during execution versus observation. Nevertheless, latent dynamics during execution and observation could be partially aligned with canonical correlation, indicating some similarity of the relationships among neural representations of different movements relative to one another during execution and observation. We also found that during action execution, mirror neurons showed consistent patterns of co-modulation both within and between sessions, but other non-mirror neurons that were modulated only during action execution and not during observation showed considerable variability of co-modulation.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "Many psychiatric disorders are associated with specific risk factors, including biological sex, chronic stress, and adversity in childhood, but mechanisms underlying these relationships are unknown. The locus coeruleus (LC) is a brain area that contains adrenergic norepinephrine (NE)-releasing neurons with established sex differences in excitability and stress sensitivity. To understand how adversity in early life affects cognitive/affective behavior and LC physiology, we exposed C57BL/6J mice to a dual-phase (early development and adolescence) early life variable stress (ELVS) paradigm and assessed behavior and LC physiology in early adulthood. ELVS caused females, but not males, to display increased novel environment exploration and reduced preference for sucrose. In addition, ELVS caused elevated activity in a familiar environment, modest deficits in Y-maze performance, and altered attention in an operant task, regardless of sex. A reduction in LC neuron excitability, partly due to an increase in action potential delay time, was also found only in female mice exposed to ELVS, paralleling robust behavioral changes. Pharmacological compensation of these changes in LC activity with reboxetine corrected some ELVS-induced behavioral changes. CRF-induced changes in LC neuron activity were also mediated by different preferential signaling pathways in male and female mice, a potential mechanism for lasting sex-specific changes in LC physiology in response to ELVS. Through this animal model of early life stress, we identified sex differences in behavior and parallel changes in LC neuron excitability and CRF sensitivity, identifying mechanisms involved in determining how stress and sex interact to cause LC activity dysregulation and related behavioral changes.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

In vivo Ca2+ imaging has demonstrated that spatially overlapping ensembles of direct and indirect pathway SPNs (dSPNs, iSPNs) are co-active during spontaneous movement. This co-activity is statistically greater among nearby neurons, correlates with behavioral state, and changes in an SPN-type-specific manner under pathological conditions. How this co-activity arises and whether is important for movement are not well understood. Co-activity likely arises from shared excitatory inputs, the strength of which are scaled by well-characterized mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that the Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which regulates the strength of corticostriatal synapses, is a key mediator of behaviorally relevant SPN co-activity. Pharmacological modulation of mGluR5 signaling bidirectionally altered movement and co-activity, but not the absolute level of activity in dSPNs. Targeted deletion of mGluR5 in dSPNs recapitulated the effects on spatiotemporal neural dynamics and movement, consistent with a striatum-specific effect of mGluR5 modulation. Targeted deletion of mGluR5 also produced changes in the synaptic properties of dSPNs. Separate from any effects on overall activity, our results show that excitatory synaptic modulation influences motor function by coordinating the spatial co-activation of dSPNs in vivo.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Yet, predicting the occurrence of dynamical shifts remains a challenge due to inferential uncertainties from datasets and the limitations of asymptotic-dependent theories. To address this problem, we developed a theoretical framework that builds on the finite nature of observations. This framework assesses the relative importance of processes, defined as the mechanisms that contribute to the rate of change of the system's dynamic variables, and it predicts the critical values that would trigger a shift into a new regime. The number of observable dynamic regimes within the framework increases exponentially with the number of processes. Observers, however, only experience dynamic regimes associated with relevant processes - those exceeding a tipping point - within their reference framework. A case study of the framework was tested for a classic predator-prey system with four processes parameterized for bacteria (prey) and lytic bacteriophages (predator). The analysis recovered the sixteen dynamic regimes predicted by the framework, including two non-trivial quasi-equilibrium dynamics. An adaptive Boolean model, which used only relevant observable processes, validated the accuracy of the framework, recovering the dynamics of the full model. The observational framework introduced here provides a strategy for identifying the processes and conditions that lead to tipping points, representing a conceptual paradigm shift in transient dynamics, placing the focus on the specific, finite context of the observer, rather than the intrinsic, asymptotic states of the system.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

We employed the Neurog1 (Ngn1) CreERT2 Chd4 conditional knockout animals to investigate Chd4 function in SGNs. SGNs are classified as type I and II neurons with different innervation patterns.

Nir1-LNS2 also showed a heightened responsiveness to PA when compared to biosensors using the Spo20 PA binding domain (PABD). Nir1-LNS2's high sensitivity revealed a modest but discernible contribution of PLD to PA production downstream of muscarinic receptors, which has not been visualized with previous Spo20-based probes.

Here, we present evidence cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a key factor in triggering the transition from RB to EB (i.e., secondary differentiation) in the chlamydial developmental cycle. By overexpressing or knocking down expression of c-di-AMP synthase genes, we made strains producing different levels of c-di-AMP, which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status. Increases in c-di-AMP resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of EB-associated genes, and this was further manifested in earlier production of EBs. In contrast, when c-di-AMP levels were decreased, EB production was reduced. Based on these data, we conclude there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP needed to trigger secondary differentiation in Chlamydia.

Employing DECODEM to analyze gene expression of breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy across three bulk cohorts, we find that the expression of specific immune cells (myeloid, plasmablasts, B-cells) and stromal cells (endothelial, normal epithelial, CAFs) are highly predictive of chemotherapy response, achieving the same prediction levels as the expression of malignant cells.

Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a multi-domain protein containing both a kinase and a GTPase, are a leading cause of the familial form of PD. Pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase LRRK2 kinase activity. While the bulk of LRRK2 is found in the cytosol, the protein associates with membranes, where its Rab GTPase substrates are found, and, under certain conditions, with microtubules. Integrative structural studies using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have revealed the architecture of microtubule-associated LRRK2 filaments, and that formation of these filaments required LRRK2's kinase to be in the active-like conformation. Whether LRRK2 can interact with and form filaments on microtubules in its autoinhibited state, where the kinase domain conformation is inactive and the N-terminal LRR domain covers the kinase catalytic site, was not known. Using cryo-ET, we showed that full-length LRRK2 can oligomerize on microtubules in its autoinhibited state. Both WT-LRRK2 and PD-linked LRRK2 mutants formed filaments on microtubules. While these filaments are stabilized by the same interfaces seen in the active-LRRK2 filaments, we observed a new interface involving the N-terminal repeats that were disordered in the active-LRRK2 filaments. The helical parameters of the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are different from those reported for the active-LRRK2 filaments. Finally, the autoinhibited-LRRK2 filaments are shorter, suggesting they are less stable.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Perceptual events and statistical relations can be represented as nodes and edges in a graph, respectively. Recent work in the field of graph learning has shown that human behavior is sensitive to graph topology, but less is known about how that topology might elicit distinct neural responses during learning. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by applying time-resolved network analyses to fMRI data collected during a visuomotor graph learning task to assess neural signatures of learning modular graphs and non-modular lattice graphs. We found that performance on this task was supported by a highly flexible visual system and otherwise relatively stable brain-wide community structure, cohesiveness within the dorsal attention, limbic, default mode, and subcortical systems, and an increasing degree of integration between the visual and ventral attention systems. Additionally, we found that the time-resolved connectivity of the limbic, default mode, temporoparietal, and subcortical systems was associated with enhanced performance for the modular group but not the lattice group. These findings provide evidence for the differential neural processing of statistical structures with distinct topologies and highlight similarities between the neural correlates of graph learning and statistical learning more broadly.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

As spatially limited systems, phagocytes have a maximal phagocytic capacity, at which point further uptake must be blunted. However, the processes responsible for phagocytic appetite exhaustion as phagocytes reach their maximal phagocytic capacity are poorly defined. We found that macrophages at their capacity have lower surface levels of Fc{gamma} receptors but overexpression of these receptors did not increase their capacity, suggesting that receptor levels are not limiting. Instead, surface membrane in-folding, membrane tension, and cortical F-actin were all reduced in exhausted macrophages. While this might contribute to appetite suppression, we also found that \"free\" endosomes and lysosomes were severely depleted in exhausted macrophages. Consequently, focal exocytosis at sites of externally bound particles was blunted. In comparison, macrophages recovered their appetite if phagosome resolution was permitted. We propose that depletion of the endomembrane pools is a major determinant of phagocytic fatigue as macrophages reach their phagocytic capacity.\n\nSummary statementMacrophages that reach their maximal phagocytic capacity lose their appetite for further uptake. This appetite exhaustion is driven partly by depletion of endosomes and lysosomes, preventing growth of additional phagocytic cups.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

In darkness, photoreceptors continuously release glutamate into the synaptic cleft, a process that diminishes in response to increased light intensity, thereby conveying visual signals to ON and OFF bipolar cells. Specifically, in zebrafish, the ON pathway signal transduction is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 6b (mGluR6b) and Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs). Here we demonstrate that knockout of eaat5b and eaat7 disrupts electroretinogram responses to short and long-wavelength stimuli while preserving middle-wavelength responses, suggesting wavelength-specific roles. We found differential expression of EAAT5b and EAAT7 in the outer plexiform layer, particularly in the strike zone, crucial for prey capture, supporting task specific involvement of these signaling pathways. In order to investigate this, we developed a virtual hunting assay using UV light stimuli.

The ability to investigate localized RNAs in bacteria is currently limited to imaging-based approaches or to laborious procedures to isolate ribonucleoprotein complexes by grad-seq, HITS-CLIP, or Rloc-seq. However, a major challenge in studying mRNA localization in bacterial cells is that bacterial mRNAs typically last for only a few minutes in the cell, while experiments to investigate their localization or interaction partners can take much longer. Therefore, rapid methods of studying RNA localization are needed to bridge this technical challenge.\n\nSummaryRapid spatially controlled methods are needed to investigate RNA localization in bacterial cells. APEX2 proximity labeling was shown to be adaptable to rapid RNA labeling in eukaryotic cells, and through the fusion of APEX2 to different proteins targeted to different subcellular locations, has been useful to identify RNA localization in these cells. Therefore, we adapted APEX2 proximity labeling of RNA to bacterial cells by generating an APEX2 fusion to the RNase E gene, which is necessary and sufficient for BR-body formation. APEX2 fusion is minimally perturbative and RNA can be rapidly labeled on the sub-minute timescale with Alkyne-Phenol, outpacing the rapid speed of mRNA decay in bacteria. Alkyne-Phenol provides flexibility in the overall downstream application with copper catalyzed click-chemistry for downstream applications, such as fluorescent dyeazides or biotin-azides for purification.

Despite much work on Relation Extraction (RE), automatically extracting causal relations from large text corpora remains less explored. Few existing studies on CRE (Causal RE) are limited to extracting causality within a sentence or for a particular disease, mainly due to the lack of a diverse benchmark dataset. Here, we carefully curate a new CRE Dataset (CRED) of 3639 (causal and non-causal) gene-disease pairs, spanning 204 diseases and 500 genes, within or across sentences of 267 published abstracts. CRED is assembled in two phases to reduce class imbalance, and its inter-annotator agreement is 89%. To assess CRED's utility in classifying causal vs. non-causal pairs, we compared multiple classifiers and found SVM (Support Vector Machine) trained on embeddings from a deep learning transformer model called BioBERT to perform the best (F1 score 0.70). CRED outperformed a state-of-the-art RE dataset in terms of classifier performance and model interpretability, i.e., whether the model focuses importance/attention on words with causal connotations in abstracts. Moving from benchmark to real-world settings, application of our CRED-trained BioBERT+SVM model on all PubMed abstracts on Parkinson's disease (PD) revealed both well- and less-studied PD-causing genes. For instance, genes predicted to be causal for PD in at least 50 abstracts by our model were already linked to PD in books; and lends confidence to further explore the other genes predicted to be causal in fewer abstracts.

However, we show that extracellular adenosine deamination catalyzed by  adenosine deaminase related growth factor (ADGF), is a major source of ammonia, and demonstrate a direct role of ammonia in tip organizer development. The tip formed during early development in Dictyostelium functions analogously to the embryonic organizer of higher vertebrates. Dictyostelium cell lines carrying mutations in the gene adgf fail to establish an organizer, and this could be reversed by exposing the mutants to volatile ammonia. Interestingly, Klebsiella pneumoniae physically separated from the Dictyostelium adgf mutants in a partitioned dish, also rescues the mound arrest phenotype suggesting a cross-kingdom interaction that drives development. Both the substrate, adenosine and the product, ammonia regulate adgf expression, and ADGF acts downstream of the histidine kinase DhkD in regulating tip formation. Thus, the consecutive transformation of extracellular cAMP to adenosine, and adenosine to ammonia are integral steps during Dictyostelium development. Remarkably, in higher vertebrates, adgf expression is elevated during gastrulation and thus adenosine deamination may be a conserved process driving organizer development in different organisms.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Density dependence suppressed population size and increased extinction risk, whereas density independence enabled rapid growth, especially in evolving genetically diverse populations.

Using vegetation data collected in 2000-2001 and 2019 for more than 3,500 trees inside and outside Madikwe Game Reserve, South Africa, we determined the long-term effects of an increasing elephant population, in conjunction with the community of meso-browsers, on structural relationships in 13 tree species. The number of trees utilised by elephants increased between 2000 and 2019, but individuals were not more intensively utilised. After almost two decades of use by elephants, we observed a reduction in the logged initial growth rate of the structural relationship between tree height and stem diameter, without modification of the asymptotic change in growth rate. Despite species-specific variability, tree height was overall reduced for a given stem diameter. Canopy area, as well as its structural relationship with stem diameter remained mostly stable. We suggest that elephants are responsible for hedging by reducing tree height. Together with impala (Aepyceros melampus), the dominant species in this meso-browser community, they could stimulate regrowth by browsing the canopy of the vegetation maintained in the browsing trap.

To test this theory, we analysed the genomes of 127 specimens collected from mammalian carnivore hosts across four continents. Here we show distinct genetic differences between heartworms from different continents, indicating a more ancient dispersal in canid hosts than previously recognised. Using admixture analyses, we find an Asian origin for Australian heartworms, consistent with the arrival of dingoes thousands of years ago. Finally, the genetic relatedness between European and Central American heartworms suggests that modern dispersal, likely associated with human colonisation of the Americas by Europeans, occurred with domesticated dogs. This work sheds light on the population dynamics and deep evolutionary history of a globally widespread parasite of veterinary significance.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we characterize group-level and individual thresholds for perceiving the presence and nature of a social interaction. We leverage the fact that humans see social interactions - e.g., chasing, playing, fighting - even in very un-lifelike stimuli like animations of geometric shapes. Unlike prior work using these stimuli, we exploit their most advantageous property: their visual features are fully parameterizable. Using this property, we construct psychophysics-inspired \"social tuning curves\" for individual subjects. We find not only that simple visual features influence social perception, but also that the exact relationship (shape of the curve) is unique to and stable within each person, thus supporting the view that social information processing begins early in the perceptual hierarchy. Further, individual differences in social tuning curves are related to socio-affective traits. Our approach lays the foundation for a generative account of social perception in single individuals.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we generate deep learning models to predict RNA Pol-II occupancy from chromatin-associated protein profiles in unperturbed conditions. We evaluate the suitability of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), a widely used explainable AI (XAI) approach, to infer functional relevance and analyse regulatory mechanisms across diverse datasets. We aim to validate these insights using data from degron-based perturbation experiments. Remarkably, genes ranked by SHAP importance predict direct targets of perturbation even from unperturbed data, enabling inference without costly experimental interventions. Our analysis reveals that SHAP not only predicts differential gene expression but also captures the magnitude of transcriptional changes. We validate the cooperative roles of SET1A and ZC3H4 at promoters and uncover novel regulatory contributions of ZC3H4 at gene bodies in influencing transcription. Cross-dataset validation uncovers unexpected connections between ZC3H4, a component of the Restrictor complex, and INTS11, part of the Integrator complex, suggesting crosstalk mediated by H3K4me3 and the SET1/COMPASS complex in transcriptional regulation. These findings highlight the power of integrating predictive modelling and experimental validation to unravel complex context-dependent regulatory networks and generate novel biological hypotheses.\n\nAuthor summaryGenes are turned on or off through complex processes involving many proteins that interact with DNA wrapped histones and modify their structure. These changes, known as epigenetic modifications, help control how genes are expressed without altering the DNA sequence itself. In this study, we wanted to understand how different proteins influence gene activity in mouse stem cells by looking at their positions along the genome, particularly whether they act near the genes start site (promoter) or within the gene body. To do this, we used machine learning models and a method called SHAP, which helps explain the models decisions. By comparing our predictions to data from experiments where specific proteins were removed, we found that some proteins have context-specific effects, acting not only at the promoter but also along the whole gene body. Our approach highlighted both well-known and unexpected regulators of transcription and revealed that gene body signals, which are often overlooked, can play key roles. These findings show how explainable AI can help uncover new insights into how epigenetic features shape gene regulation, and offer a powerful way to generate testable hypotheses from complex genomic data.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

We observe glucose-dependent redistributions of mitochondria, favoring peripheral localization at elevated glucose levels when insulin secretion is also elevated. Our results, formalized into a stochastic model of mitochondrial trafficking, suggest that active mitochondrial transport along microtubules and calcium activity, but not ATP synthesis, are critical regulators of this redistribution.

To investigate this, we developed the Face Memory and Perception (FMP) task, a novel paradigm designed to systematically disentangle whether and how these processes interact under different conditions. Across five independent datasets with over 900 participants in total, we observed consistent evidence that face perception and working memory operate independently when task demands are low, but in more complex conditions, these processes appear to interact. Notably, this interaction emerged only when the interference directly involved face-processing mechanisms, and did not arise from a general increase in cognitive load. Rather than the use of shared resources by overlapping cognitive processes, this interaction was driven by a shift in behavioural strategy from holistic to feature-based face processing as a result of maintenance-disrupting interference. These results underscore the fundamental independence of perception and working memory while also explaining some of the conditions under which interactions might be observed.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Successful DNA transcription demands coordination between proteins that bind DNA while simultaneously binding to one another to form dimers or higher-order complexes. For proteins with numerous DNA targets throughout the genome, measurements that report on their dwell time or occupancy thus represent a convolution over a population interacting with specific DNA, nonspecific DNA, or protein partners on DNA. Dimerization is known to add contacts that can help a single protein to stably bind DNA. However, we show here that dimerization can also impair measured dwell times and occupancy on target sequences because the population redistributes across DNA. We combine mass-action kinetic models of pairwise reversible reactions between proteins and DNA with theory and spatial stochastic simulations to isolate the role of dimerization on observed DNA dwell times, occupancy, and spatial distribution of proteins on DNA. Three key themes emerge: (i) Protein-protein interactions, in addition to protein-DNA interactions, can localize a protein to DNA, and relative binding rates can thus widely tune dwell times. (ii) Dimensional reduction achieved through nonspecific binding and subsequent 1D diffusion controls the order-of-magnitude of enhancements despite nucleosome barriers. (iii) Dimerization enhances selectivity for locally clustered targets and often impairs binding to widely-spaced targets by sequestration. Compared with ChIP-seq data, our model explains how the distribution of the essential GAF protein throughout the genome is highly selective for clustered targets due to protein interactions. This model framework predicts when even weak dimerization can redistribute and stabilize proteins on DNA as a necessary part of transcription.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

BLV is highly prevalent in the Americas and negatively affects dairy herds, primarily due to restrictions on the commercialization of dairy products from infected animals and a decrease in milk production. Mixed infections involving BLV and BFV appear to be common in cattle. Considering the ability of foamy viruses to cross species barriers, preventing their presence within the food chain is essential. We identified the co-expression of seven BLV-derived miRNAs (blv-miR-B1-3p, blv-miR-B2-5p, blv-miR-B2-3p, blv-miR-B3-5p, blv-miR-B3-3p, blv-miR-B4-3p and blv-miR-B5-5p) and three BFV-derived (bfv-miR-BF1-5p, bfv-miR-BF1-3p, and bfv-miR-BF2-5p) in naturally BLV-infected cows. Besides, seven differentially expressed bovine miRNAs (bta-miR-375, bta-miR-133a, bta-miR-677, bta-miR-1, bta-miR-3613a, bta-miR-9-5p and bta-miR-95) were identified between cows with high BLV proviral load and uninfected counterparts (fold change > |1.5| and q-value < 0.05). A comprehensive functional analysis of protein-protein interaction networks for genes targeted by both viral and host-derived miRNAs highlighted key pathways implicated in tumorigenesis and immune response. Although BLV and BFV derived miRNAs target different genes, their functional convergence may reflect coordinated viral modulation of host cellular processes, raising important concerns regarding their potential influence on disease severity and the increased dissemination of BFV.

Rapid and accurate IAV subtypes and host source prediction is crucial for effective surveillance and pandemic preparedness. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing viral genomic sequences, offering new ways to uncover hidden patterns associated with viral characteristics and host adaptation. Findings We introduce WaveSeekerNet, a novel deep learning model for accurate and rapid prediction of IAV subtypes and host source. The model leverages attention-based mechanisms and efficient token mixing schemes, including the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform, to capture intricate patterns within viral RNA and protein sequences. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate WaveSeekerNet's superior performance to existing models that use the traditional self-attention mechanism. Notably, WaveSeekerNet rivals VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) in subtype prediction using the high-quality RNA sequences, achieving the maximum score of 1.0 on metrics including the Balanced Accuracy, F1-score (Macro Average), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Our approach to subtype and host source prediction also exceeds the pre-trained ESM-2 (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) models with respect to generalization performance and computational cost. Furthermore, WaveSeekerNet exhibits remarkable accuracy in distinguishing between human, avian, and other mammalian hosts. The ability of WaveSeekerNet to flag potential cross-species transmission events underscores its significant value for real-time surveillance and proactive pandemic preparedness efforts. Conclusions WaveSeekerNet's superior performance, efficiency, and ability to flag potential cross-species transmission events highlight its potential for real-time surveillance and pandemic preparedness.

J.; Feder, A.

Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy can prevent marrow failure and lower leukemia risk, but mucosal gene therapy to lower HNSCC risk remains untested. Major knowledge gaps include an incomplete understanding of how rapidly gene-corrected cellular lineages could spread through the oral epithelium, and which delivery parameters are critical for ensuring efficient gene correction. To answer these questions, we extended an agent-based model of the oral epithelium to include the delivery of gene correction in situ to FA cells and the competitive dynamics between cellular lineages with and without gene correction. We found that only gene-corrected lineages with substantial proliferative advantages (probability of resisting displacement out of the basal layer [&ge;] 0. 1) could spread on clinically relevant timelines, and that these lineages were initially at high risk of loss in the generations following correction. Delivering gene correction to many cells minimizes the risk of loss, while delivery to many distinct locations within a tissue maximizes the rate of spread. To determine the impact of mucosal gene therapy in preventing the clonal expansion of pre-cancerous mutations, we compared the expected burden of TP53 mutations in simulated tissue sections with and without gene correction. We found that when FA cells have elevated genome instability or a TP53-dependent proliferative advantage, gene correction can substantially reduce the accumulation of pro-tumorigenic mutations. This model illustrates the power of computational frameworks to identify critical determinants of therapeutic success to enable experimental optimization and support novel and effective gene therapy applications.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Visuomotor experience is necessary for the development of normal function of visual cortex (Attinger et al., 2017) and likely establishes a balance between movement-related predictions and sensory signals (Jordan and Keller, 2020). This process depends at least in part on plasticity in visual cortex (Widmer et al., 2022). Key signals involved in driving this plasticity are visuomotor prediction errors (Keller et al., 2012; Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018). Ideally however, the amount of plasticity induced by an error signal should be a function of several variables - including the total prediction error across all of cortex at that moment, the animal's experience in the current environment or task, stability of the current environment, and task engagement - for optimal computational performance. Candidates for regulators of visuomotor prediction error driven plasticity are the three major neuromodulatory systems that innervate visual cortex in the mouse: acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. While visuomotor mismatch acutely triggers activity in noradrenaline (Jordan and Keller, 2023) but not acetylcholine (Yogesh and Keller, 2023) axons in visual cortex, how serotonergic axons in cortex respond to visuomotor mismatch is unknown. Here, we characterized the activity of serotonergic axons in visual cortex (V1) and in area A24b, a motor cortical area in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), of awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Our results reveal cortical region-specific responses to visuomotor stimuli in serotonergic axons, but no evidence of a response to visuomotor mismatch. However, average activity in serotonergic axons was modulated by the recent history of visuomotor coupling. We speculate that serotonin could function to regulate visuomotor plasticity as a function of the predictability of the environment with a slow integration time constant.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

DSD has been identified in models with simpler genotype-phenotype maps (GPMs), however the extent of DSD in more complex GPMs, such as developmental systems, is debated. To investigate the occurrence of DSD in complex developmental GPMs, we constructed a multi-scale computational model of the evolution of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) governing plant meristem (stem cell niche) development. We found that, during adaptation, some regulatory interactions became essential for the correct expression of stem cell niche genes. These regulatory interactions were subsequently conserved for thousands of generations. Nevertheless, we observed that these deeply conserved regulatory interactions could be lost over the extended period of neutral evolution. These losses were compensated by changes elsewhere in the GRN, which then became conserved as well. This gain and loss of regulatory interactions resulted in a continual cis-regulatory rewiring in which accumulated changes caused changes in the expression of several genes. Using two publicly available datasets we confirmed the prevalence of cis-regulatory changes across six evolutionary divergent plant species, and showed that these changes do not necessarily impact gene expression patterns, demonstrating the occurrence of DSD. These findings align with the results from our computational model, showing that DSD is pervasive in the evolution of complex developmental systems.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

For example, courtship behavior involves sensorimotor processing of signals that can result in behavioral dialogue between partners, such as stereotyped movements and singing. The courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster males with their partners, which are usually female but can also be male, involves singing. To investigate how behavioral feedback and sensorimotor processing contribute to flexible social interactions, we compared the courtship behavior and singing of male D. melanogaster towards males and females. Quantitative analysis of their interactions revealed that while underlying courtship and song rules are unaffected by the sex of the partner, the behavioral dynamics and song sequences differ by partner sex. This divergence stems from sex-specific behavioral feedback: females decelerate to song, while males orient towards the singer. Moreover, optogenetic manipulations reveal that the partners responses are driven by sex-specific neural circuits that link song detection with arousal and social decisions. Our findings demonstrate that flexible social behaviors can arise from fixed sensorimotor rules through a context-dependent selection facilitated by the partners behavioral feedback.

These patterns are often attributed to passive loss from factors such as thymic atrophy and cumulative immune exposures but such processes fail to explain the systematic variation observed across populations. Here we challenge this view by analyzing TCR{beta} repertoires from ~30,000 individuals showing that TCR diversity is almost entirely determined by repertoire size and the frequency of the 1,000 most abundant clones. These two intrinsic features of the repertoire explain 96% of the variance in TCR diversity, capturing its dependence on age and sex and defining a robust relationship that holds even under strong immune perturbations such as Cytomegalovirus infection. This relationship arises because the frequency of abundant clones captures a repertoire-wide pattern of coordinated clonal expansion---termed intrinsic clonality---which may be a fundamental, previously unrecognized property of the immune system. We propose that TCR diversity emerges as a system-level property mediated by repertoire size and intrinsic clonality, both of which are likely homeostatically regulated.

We assessed changes in the distribution of centromeres at single cell resolution as surrogate markers for global genome organization. The screens revealed multiple major regulators of spatial distribution of centromeres including components of the nucleolus, kinetochore, cohesins, condensins, and the nuclear pore complex. Alterations in centromere distribution required progression through the cell cycle and acute depletion of mitotic factors with distinct functions altered centromere distribution in the subsequent interphase.

One major limitation of most conventional flow cytometry analyses is the dependency on a mostly manual gating process. This generally involves sequentially selecting biomarkers to isolate phenotype-associated cell populations, an approach that is both labor-intensive and prone to bias. To address this challenge, we introduce the application of a series of multi-instance learning frameworks for automated flow cytometry data analysis. Our models demonstrate strong performance across diverse biomedical applications, including cancer subtyping based on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, HIV survival stratification, AML minimal residual disease prediction, and COVID-19 severity assessment. We further examine how network architecture affects predictive performance and the detection of rare but clinically significant cell populations. Notably, our models utilize attention mechanisms to directly identify phenotype-associated cell subsets, serving as an interpretable, data-driven alternative to fully manual gating. These findings underscore the potential of multi-instance learning as a scalable and interpretable framework for flow cytometry, with broad applications in precision medicine and translational immunology.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

M.; Lehmann, O. J.", "abstract": "Cancer repeatedly exploits attributes fundamental for morphogenesis to advance malignancy and metastasis. This is illustrated by lineage specific transcription factors that regulate neural crest migration representing frequent drivers of malignancy. One such example is the forkhead transcription factor FOXC1 where gain of function is a feature of diverse cancers that is associated with an unfavourable prognosis. Using RNA-, ChIP-sequencing and CRISPR interference, we show that Foxc1 binds a locus in a region of closed chromatin to induce expression of Arhgap36, a tissue-specific inhibitor of Protein Kinase A. Because PKA is a core Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitor, Foxc1s induction of Arhgap36 expression increases Hh activity. The function of Sufu, a PKA substrate and a second essential Hh pathway inhibitor, is likewise impaired. The resulting increased Hh pathway output is resistant to pharmacological inhibition of Smoothened, a phenotype of more aggressive cancers. The Foxc1-Arhgap36 relationship identified in murine cells was further evaluated in neuroblastoma, a neural crest derived pediatric malignancy. This demonstrated in a cohort of 1348 patients that high levels of ARHGAP36 are predictive of improved five-year survival. Accordingly, this study has identified as a novel transcription factor which enhances ARHGAP36 expression, one that induces Hh activity in multiple tissues during development. It also establishes a model by which increased levels of FOXC1 via ARHGAP36 and PKA inhibition dysregulate multiple facets of Hh signaling, and provides evidence demonstrating relevance to a common neural-crest derived malignancy.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Understanding the dynamic interaction between the viral life cycle and immune signaling is crucial to designing effective antiviral strategies. Although significant progress has been made, the development of quantitative models that can fully explain the intricate interactions and the intertwined dynamics of viruses and host cells remains incomplete. In this study, we develop a comprehensive mathematical model that integrates the intracellular viral life cycle with key cellular innate immune pathways, including RIG-I-mediated detection and JAK-STAT signaling. The model provides mechanistic insights into long-standing observations, capturing both virus-specific dynamics and innate immune response. For example, a comparison of viruses shows how the Japanese Encephalitis virus undergoes a dramatic reduction in viral load when subjected to immune pressure, due to its rapid replication and robust immune activation, in contrast to the more modest reduction observed for HCV. In addition, our model establishes how virus-host interactions exhibit a sharp bifurcation behaviour, where minor perturbations in immune strength or viral suppression capacity can determine whether infections resolve or persist. Although previously ascribed to cellular heterogeneity during infection, we propose that ISG mRNA translation along with viral replication predominantly dictates these bimodal infection outcomes. Similarly, the model successfully recapitulates the well-described IFN desensitization phenomenon, and we can leverage this to predict optimal timing and dosing strategies for interferon-based prophylactic therapies. Together, our approach reveals fundamental features that govern the delicate balance between viral persistence and immune control in RNA virus infections and potential avenues for future antiviral strategies.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Trained on over one million active protein-ligand pairs from BindingDB, ProtoBind-Diff generates chemically valid, novel, and target-specific ligands without requiring structural supervision. In extensive benchmarking against structure-based models, ProtoBind-Diff performs competitively in docking and Boltz-1 evaluations and generalizes well to challenging targets, including those with limited training data. Despite never observing 3D information during training, its attention maps align with predicted binding residues, suggesting the model learns spatially meaningful interaction priors from sequence alone.

D.", "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity occurs when a genotype can produce more than one phenotype under different environmental conditions. Genetic accommodation allows plastic phenotypes to be tuned to new environments and eventually to even be lost via canalization/assimilation. The colourful and toxic Heliconiini butterflies have biochemical plasticity - they either sequester their cyanogenic glucosides (CG) from their larval hostplant or biosynthesize them when compounds for sequestration are not available. Here, we traced the evolution of CG biosynthesis in Heliconiini butterflies, a fundamental component of this biochemical plasticity. We first CRISPR-edited the CYP405s, which encode the first enzyme of this pathway in Heliconius erato, and confirmed that CYP405-knockout caterpillars do not biosynthesize CGs. Then, we identified the CYP405s and CYP332s (the second gene in this pathway) in 63 species of the subfamily Heliconiinae, as well as in other lepidopterans. Most lepidopterans have a CYP332, but CYP405 is mostly found in butterflies and has been duplicated in all Heliconius species. Both genes were independently co-opted into CG biosynthesis in the Heliconiinae butterflies and Zygaena moths, in which they were first functionally characterized. Finally, we performed ancestral reconstruction analyses of biochemical plasticity using data from over 700 Heliconiini butterflies. We demonstrated that although plasticity was ancestral in the whole tribe and allowed these butterflies to increase their hostplant range, it might have been lost in few specialized clades, such as the Sapho clade that just sequester CG from their hostplants. This clade has several CYP405 copies, but they lack structurally important P450 domains, which may explain why biosynthesized CGs are virtually lost in species of the Sapho clade. Our findings represent one of the few examples of plasticity-first evolution in which the genetic mechanisms associated with its accommodation/assimilation are known. This study also emphasizes the importance of co-option in the evolution of complex traits, such as toxicity.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

One such species of conservation concern, the eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferus), requires diverse forest structural conditions to meet its breeding season habitat requirements. We used airborne LiDAR data and autonomous recording units (ARUs) to identify elements of forest structure that influence whip-poor-will breeding season abundance in Pennsylvania, USA. Specifically, we applied a machine-learning classifier for whip-poor-will song to audio recordings obtained from 851 ARUs that were deployed in forested landscapes and then created daily detection histories to estimate whip-poor-will relative abundance. Whip-poor-wills were detected at 334 survey locations (41%). Abundance exhibited positive linear relationships with percent forest cover and percent oak forest and a negative linear relationship with percent impervious cover. Whip-poor-will abundance was also influenced by forest structure, with abundance exhibiting a quadratic relationship with two LiDAR-derived covariates; canopy heterogeneity and height within 300 m.

Emerging evidence suggests that pre-existing differences in cell state may modulate signaling responses to new stimuli, but the interplay of specific cell states and signals remains unclear. We investigated whether epithelial-mesenchymal (E/M) state, a major axis of cancer cell heterogeneity, influences signaling responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF), a critical oncogenic stimulus in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We imaged >64,000 A549 NSCLC cells labeled for DNA, F-actin and alternate signaling markers (p-AKT-S473, p-AKT-T308, p-ERK or p-S6) after acute stimulation. Quantitative single-cell morphological and spatial profiling defined a stimulus-invariant  E/M state landscape over which EGF signaling responses were compared. This revealed state-dependent differences in signal-activation magnitudes, dynamics and subcellular routing. AKT responses exhibited phosphosite- and compartment-specific dynamics across states, with epithelial cells showing strong, transient membrane-localized S473 and higher internalized T308, whereas mesenchymal cells displayed weaker but sustained nuclear and ruffle-localized S473. Regression-based computational multiplexing concurrently inferred all signaling responses per cell, mapping state-dependent divergence in multi-molecular signaling trajectories.

In Antarctica, changing sea ice dynamics threaten ice-dependent species. Behavioural adjustments could help mitigate these threats, but how they link to demographic rates, as well as potential thresholds, remains elusive. Long-term studies and circumpolar approaches could address this challenge. Here, we used a 15-year dataset (2010-2024) comprising over 23,000 foraging trips from Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) in East Antarctica, to investigate how the species responds to variable sea ice conditions during reproduction via flexible foraging effort (trip duration). We identified a non-linear relationship between sea ice concentration (SIC) and foraging effort in the absence of landfast ice, a feature predicted to define the species future habitat during chick-rearing. Minimal effort occurred around 10-20% SIC and increased more than two-fold in the presence of landfast ice, or of heavy pack-ice (>76% SIC). This relationship was sex-specific, with females showing greater environmental sensitivity. Through a circumpolar synthesis, we also showed that foraging effort during chick-guard predicted reproductive success across ten populations spread across the Adelie penguins range (marginal R{superscript 2} = 0.74). Threshold analysis revealed that reproductive success remains comparatively high until chick-guard foraging trip duration exceeds [~]29 hours (approximately three times minimum values), beyond which demographic performance declines at a stronger rate. Our findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Adelie penguins responses across a large environmental gradient, revealing that behavioural flexibility can buffer moderate changes but has clear limits.

Furthermore, Chelotococcus sp. strain D3 demonstrated the capability to catalyze the biotransformation of diclofenac into 4-hydroxydiclofenac in treated wastewater. Notably, this transformation was effectively carried out even at lower temperatures (25 {degrees}C and 37{degrees}C). These results show that the use of thermophilic consortia can be applied for efficient bioremediation in wastewater treatment plants, specifically for compounds that mesophilic organisms degrade poorly.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

ODFormer first employed two encoders, pretrained on 30,000 pan cancer bulk transcriptomics and 1 million PC single cell profiles respectively, to distil tissue and organoid specific representations. Then, trained on our curated 14,000 PDO drug-response assay (across 183 PDOs and 98 drugs) us-ing a transformer augmented hybrid contrastive network, ODFormer significantly outperformed SOTA methods, notably achieving a PCC >0.9 in predicting standardized drug response.

This study examined whether this negative relationship also within modules, to evaluate the validity of functional parcellation (FP) as a preprocessing step for neural network construction, and explored age-related effects on these associations. Methods: Using MOSI (modularity analysis and similarity measurements), rsfMRI data from three public datasets spanning different age cohorts were analyzed. Correlations between nodal strength (or voxel concordance within modules) and ALFF were calculated. Geometric mean p-values assessed robustness at the individual level. Results: Confirming prior findings, a significant inverse correlation between nodal strength and ALFF was observed at the between-module level (geometric p-values 10-4 to 10-5). Within-module negative associations were nonsignificant in younger cohorts (mean ages 10 and 21) but became significant in the older cohort (mean age 33). The magnitude of this negative association increased with age, consistent with maturation of local inhibitory network mechanisms.

Sequences were classified into transmitted founder lineages (TFLs), and infections with multiple distinct lineages were determined.

The high levels of multilineage infections could be attributed to minor lineages (<5% abundance) identified in 20% of participants. Infection with VRC01 discordant viruses (IC80s >3-fold different) was observed in 40% of multilineage infections, with a trend toward greater intra-host neutralization differences with increasing VRC01 dose (Jonckheere-Terpstra test, p=0.072). In six VRC01 treated participants who acquired both sensitive (IC80<1mcg/ml) and resistant viruses (IC80>3mcg/ml), the sensitive lineages declined over time.

While CHC profiles are largely genetically determined, several studies have linked diet to cuticular hydrocarbons and limited research indicates a potential influence of dietary fatty acids. Considering this, the current work investigates the effect of nine cereal flours, i.e., wheat, rice, maize, barley, oat, ragi, sorghum, soybean and gram, each with a distinct fatty acid composition, on the cuticular wax profile of Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), a globally significant stored grain insect. Fatty acid compositions of the nine flours and the cuticular waxes from the beetle populations reared on each diet were characterized using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In all the beetle populations, the most abundant compound was 1-pentadecene, followed by cis-9-tetradecen-1-ol and 1-heptadecene, irrespective of the diet. While no qualitative differences in cuticular wax composition were found, significant quantitative variation in cuticular wax profile was observed across dietary groups. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis revealed a cumulative Bray- Curtis dissimilarity of 47.72 among the flour samples based on their fatty acid profiles, and a dissimilarity of 18.51 among T. castaneum populations reared on these flours based on their cuticular wax composition. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) further indicated substantial variation in the cuticular wax profiles of beetle populations raised on different dietary sources. Pearsons correlation analysis between the concentrations of individual cuticular wax components and the fatty acid content of the respective diets demonstrated strong correlations between specific cuticular compounds and dietary fatty acids. Notably, levels of 1-pentadecene in the beetle cuticle were strongly associated with the concentrations of hexadecanoic and octadecanoic acids in the flours. These results support the hypothesis that, alongside endogenous conserved biosynthetic pathways, dietary fatty acid composition contributes to the modulation of insect cuticular chemistry. This dietary influence may have important implications for understanding insect ecological plasticity and diet-mediated changes in surface chemistry.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

While genetics has long been considered the primary determinant of craniofacial morphology, emerging evidence suggests that prenatal and early postnatal dietary exposures also influence facial morphology. However, how maternal diet differentially affects male and female craniofacial structures remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the effects of a maternal high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) diet on craniofacial and dental morphology in first-(F1) and second-(F2) generation adult mice.\n\nMaterials and MethodsFemale mice were fed a HFHS diet for six weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. F1 offspring were weaned to a standard chow diet, and a subset of female F1 offspring were bred to produce F2 offspring, also maintained on chow. Craniofacial skeletal and dental structures of adult F1 and F2 mice at 1-year of age were assessed using micro-computed tomography for linear and geometric morphometrics.\n\nResultsHFHS diet exposure significantly reduced midfacial and mandibular length in F1 females, and these effects persisted in F2 females. Mandibular shape differences were also observed in both generations of females. In males, skull size remained unchanged, though subtle mandibular shape changes were noted in F1 only. Tooth size was reduced in both sexes of F1 offspring but not in F2.\n\nConclusionMaternal HFHS diet induces sex- and jaw-specific alterations in craniofacial morphology, with skeletal changes persisting in females across generations, while dental effects did not persist beyond one generation.

Understanding how Ae. aegypti adapts to environmental pressures--such as insecticides--is critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. However, most traditional methods for detecting recent positive selection search for signatures of classic \"hard\" selective sweeps, and to date no studies have examined soft sweeps in Ae. aegypti. This represents a significant limitation as this is vital information for understanding the pace at which an organism can adapt--populations that are able to immediately respond to new selective pressures are expected to adapt more often via standing variation or recurrent adaptive mutations (both of which may produce soft sweeps) than via de novo mutations (which produces hard sweeps). To this end, we used a machine learning method capable of detecting hard and soft sweeps to investigate positive selection in Ae. aegypti population samples from Africa and the Americas. Our results reveal that soft sweep signatures are significantly more common than hard sweeps in all population samples, including those that have experienced population bottlenecks, which may imply that this species can respond quickly to environmental stressors. This is a particularly concerning finding for vector control methods that aim to eradicate Ae. aegypti through the use of insecticides. We highlight genes under selection that include both well-characterized and putatively novel insecticide resistance genes. These findings underscore the importance of using methods capable of detecting and distinguishing hard and soft sweeps, implicate soft sweeps as a major selective mode in Ae. aegypti, and highlight genes that may aid in the control of Ae. aegypti populations.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Studying GAPDH quantitatively is crucial for understanding how subtle variations at the sequence and structural levels drive such functional diversity across evolutionary lineages. In this study, 165 GAPDH protein sequences from 158 organisms were analyzed to uncover conserved and divergent features underlying multifunctionality. While core catalytic residues were strongly preserved, selective enrichment of small non-polar residues such as valine and alanine suggested a structural basis for flexibility and adaptive potential. The balanced distribution of order- and disorder-promoting residues and the avoidance of long homopolymeric stretches indicated evolutionary selection for both structural coherence and local flexibility. Spatial distribution of amino acids in GAPDH sequences revealed low fractal variance across sequences, with moderate differences in residue clustering patterns pointing to localized adaptations without compromising overall organization. These findings demonstrate that GAPDH multifunctionality is encoded through compositional signatures and conserved spatial architecture, allowing the coexistence of metabolic stability and regulatory plasticity. The results have broad implications for understanding protein evolution, structural adaptability in extreme environments, and functional versatility in pathogenic contexts. This study establishes GAPDH as a model for exploring principles of protein moonlighting and highlights the potential of quantitative compositional analysis in uncovering hidden functional layers.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

We develop a paradigm with odours as conditioned stimuli paired with optogenetically induced backward movement instead of a punishing unconditioned stimulus, and combined these experiments with pharmacology, high-resolution video tracking, functional imaging, connectome analyses, and modelling. Our results show that backward movement engages dopaminergic punishment neurons and supports aversive memories. Such avoidance-to-punishment feedback counterbalances extinction learning and maintains learned avoidance, reducing the risk of further punishment.

Integrative transcriptomic profiling of human calciphylaxis lesions and atherosclerotic coronaries identified FNDC1 as one of the most significantly upregulated genes. In primary human vascular smooth muscle cells, FNDC1 drove osteogenic phenotype switch and vascular calcification through activation of PI3K/AKT signaling and metabolic reprogramming.

Density increased with the number of habitants within a household but was unaffected by bed net usage. A subset of female mosquitoes from the species complex was genotyped for species identification. The composition of An. coluzzii and An. gambiae, the two dominant vectors in the region, varied hugely across villages without a clear seasonal tread. The between-village variance contributed up to 76% of the total random variation, followed by the between-year variance. The between-house variation was estimated to be insignificant. Neither household size nor bed net usage had any impact on their proportion.\n\nIn short, the relative importance of the random components in mosquito density was in the reverse order from species composition. The variance estimates and relative strengths help parameterise potential field trials for novel vector control programmes and monitoring.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Nanoparticulate mineralized collagen glycosaminoglycan (MC-GAG) scaffolds have demonstrated to promote skull regeneration in vivo without addition of growth factors or exogenous progenitor cells, offering a materials-only solution for cranial defect reconstructions. Further enhancement of the safety and regenerative potential of MC-GAG is however necessary for clinical translation. Here, we investigated the regenerative effect of MC-GAG scaffold fixation with a resorbable poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) implant for cerebral protection.\n\nMethodsFourteen-millimeter cranial defects were created in New Zealand white rabbits, divided into four groups: 1) defect only, 2) defect with PDLLA, 3) MC-GAG, and 4) MC-GAG with PDLLA. Initial bone healing assessment was conducted at 3 and 9 months using microcomputed tomography (microCT), histology, reference point indentation, and scanning electron microscopy. Long-term effects were evaluated through in vivo microCT imaging at 3, 6, and 9 months, with biomechanical testing of explanted skulls at 9 months.\n\nResultsAt 3 months, MC-GAG significantly enhanced mineralization compared to empty and PDLLA-treated defects, with even greater mineralization observed for MC-GAG-PDLLA. Histologically, MC-GAG demonstrated trabecular mineralization, while MC-GAG-PDLLA had a structural organization resembling native bone. Biomechanical assessment showed enhanced toughness and stiffness for both MC-GAG and MC-GAG-PDLLA. At 6 months, MC-GAG-PDLLA displayed the highest bone mass, and at 9 months, both MC-GAG-containing scaffolds demonstrated superior bone regeneration compared to controls. By 9 months, PDLLA implants were completely resorbed and MC-GAG-PDLLA exhibited mechanical properties surpassing those of all other groups.\n\nConclusionsFixation of MC-GAG scaffolds with PDLLA implants improved mineralization and bone regeneration compared to either material alone for cranial defect reconstruction.\n\nClinical Relevance StatementCranioplasties are essential for cerebral protection and neurological restoration, but current materials have limitations, necessitating alternative bone biomaterials for improved outcomes.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Despite recent advances in spatial transcriptomics, a unified foundation model capturing cross-species, whole-brain cellular architecture remains lacking. Here, we introduce BrainBeacon, the first cross-species foundation model for whole-brain spatial transcriptomics. Trained on 133 million spatially resolved cells covering a total area of 210194 mm2 from human, macaque, marmoset and mouse brains profiled across five major platforms, BrainBeacon integrates gene expression rankings, spatial cellular organization, and evolutionarily conserved genetic relationships into a unified transformer-based architecture. A two-stage training strategy captures both intra-cellular transcriptional dependencies and inter-cellular spatial interactions, yielding biologically grounded and interpretable representations of brain structure. Subsequently, BrainBeacon enables cross-species alignment of brain cell types and anatomical regions, facilitating integrative analyses of conserved and divergent cellular architectures. Moreover, it uncovers spatial regulatory mechanisms of aging by predicting bidirectional perturbation responses between cells and their local niche. Together, BrainBeacon serves as a foundational cross-species model for whole-brain spatial transcriptomics, enabling virtual brain atlas construction, systematic in silico perturbation studies, and mechanistic insights into brain disease pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

To address these challenges, it is common to first infer gene trees using conventional models, then refine them through species tree-aware correction methods. Recently, it has been argued that such corrections can lead to overfitting and force gene trees to resemble the species tree, thereby obscuring genuine gene-level variation caused by ILS.

Exploring how canonical recurrent neural circuits in the brain realize dynamic inference is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Nearly all existing studies on dynamic inference focus on deterministic algorithms, whereas cortical circuits are intrinsically stochastic, with accumulating evidence suggesting that they employ stochastic Bayesian sampling algorithms. Nevertheless, nearly all circuit sampling studies focused on static inference with fixed posterior over time instead of dynamic inference, leaving a gap between circuit sampling and dynamic inference. To bridge this gap, we study the sampling-based dynamic inference in a canonical recurrent circuit model with excitatory (E) neurons and two types of inhibitory interneurons: parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) neurons. We find that the canonical circuit unifies Langevin and Hamiltonian sampling to infer either static or dynamic latent states with various moving speeds. Remarkably, switching sampling algorithms and adjusting model's internal latent moving speed can be realized by modulating the gain of SOM neurons without changing synaptic weights. Moreover, when the circuit employs Hamiltonian sampling, its sampling trajectories oscillate around the true latent moving state, resembling the decoded spatial trajectories from hippocampal theta sequences. Our work provides overarching connections between the canonical circuit with diverse interneurons and sampling-based dynamic inference, deepening our understanding of the circuit implementation of Bayesian sampling.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

In reproductive immunology by contrast, pregnancy represents a spontaneous model of tolerance where the semi-allogeneic fetus evades rejection even in multiparous or previously sensitized mothers. CD8+ T cell phenotypes of tolerance and rejection have been previously reported in transplant and pregnancy, but the transcriptional states of donor and fetus-specific CD4+ T cells remain poorly defined. To address this, we performed Single-cell RNA-sequencing (ScRNA-seq) on endogenous, donor-specific CD4+ T cells across models of naive or paternally skin sensitized pregnancy as well as in a model of allogeneic heart transplants with or without co-stimulation blockade-induced tolerance. Our systems biology approach allowed us to identify shared and distinct transcriptional clusters of donor-specific CD4+ Foxp3neg T conventional (Tconvs) and Foxp3pos regulatory (Tregs) T cells from peripheral lymphoid tissue. We expectedly found regulatory populations restricted to tolerance and pregnancy but were surprised to find significant overlap in activated follicular and non-follicular effector phenotypes in rejection and successful pregnancy. We also showed these murine populations were relevant and enriched in human datasets of health and disease respectively. These findings highlight context-dependent differentiation programs of antigen-specific CD4+ T conventional and regulatory cells and provide new insights into their responses to allogeneic conflict at the intersection of transplant and reproductive immunology.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we characterized the microbiomes of two tick species Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis collected between 2020 and 2023. We compared microbial alpha and beta diversity across prairie types and tick species and used differential abundance analysis to identify key bacterial taxa, including symbionts and pathogens, associated with each habitat. Our results revealed that tick species identity had a stronger influence on microbiome composition than prairie type. D. variabilis exhibited greater microbial diversity, with higher abundance of Francisella, while A. americanum harbored more Rickettsia, including pathogenic strains. Although alpha diversity did not differ significantly by prairie type, community composition and pathogen profiles did, with ticks from reconstructed prairies carrying a higher proportion of pathogenic Rickettsia. These findings suggest that restoration status can influence the environmental context for tick microbiomes and pathogen dynamics.

Imaging lung tumors in live animals to monitor tumor growth and response to therapy is challenging due to the location of the lungs and their constant movement during breathing. Additionally, methods such as computed tomography (CT) only provide structural information and not functional information about how well the lungs are working. X-ray velocimetry (XV) is a novel functional lung imaging technique that generates 3D maps of regional lung expansion during breathing. In other lung diseases it has been shown to provide spatial information on where ventilation changes occur. The aim of this pilot study was to use XV and flexiVent lung mechanics assessments to determine the effect of tumor growth on lung function in mice at 2- or 3-weeks post tumor induction, and to evaluate the efficacy of these two tools. Histological analysis showed that tumour growth was not uniform between animals. At 3-weeks post tumor induction, some XV ventilation and flexiVent lung mechanics parameters were significantly different from baseline metrics. In addition, the forced expiratory volume, small-scale ventilation heterogeneity, and the average CT gray value correlated with the tumour counts from the histology. In some mice XV revealed localised regions with altered expansion rates.

In this meta-(re-)analysis of open-access M/EEG datasets (n = 6; 4 EEG and 2 MEG), we compared periodic and aperiodic characteristics of resting-state recordings in 368 patients with Parkinsons disease and 570 age-matched healthy controls. Specifically, we compared the power and peak frequency of the aperiodic-adjusted alpha and beta oscillations, and the aperiodic exponent and offset across the two groups. Using spectral parametrisation, individuals with Parkinsons disease had higher alpha-band power and a slower alpha peak frequency compared to controls, however no group differences in beta-band power and peak frequency were identified in this resting state data. Parkinsons patients were furthermore found to have consistently higher aperiodic offset and exponent, possibly indicative of increased cortical inhibition.

Stored information can be binary, such as the presence or absence of an object, or multivalued, such as the graded intensity or location of a feature. Remarkably, there are currently no computational models of working memory that can robustly maintain both the graded intensity and spatial location of a stored item. Here, we show how this limitation can be overcome if neurons contain multiple bistable dendritic compartments. We first illustrate the core mechanism in a simple network architecture for both a spiking model with conductance-based dendrites and a rate-based model that permits analytic understanding. We then implement this mechanism within a ring model architecture for spatial working memory, in which neurons are arranged in a one-dimensional line or ring such that the spatial location of an item is encoded by the set of neurons that are active. In contrast to classic ring models, which encode the binary presence and continuous location of an item, we show that the multi-dendrite-neuron model can robustly (without fine tuning and with minimal drift in response to noise) encode both the amplitude and the location of an item in working memory. This work provides a solution to the problem of encoding graded information in spatial working memory and demonstrates how dendritic computation can increase the capacity and robustness of working memory.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Despite its theoretical significance, the neural circuitry that implements precision-weighted prediction remains unclear. Using 7-Tesla fMRI and dynamic causal modelling (DCM), this study investigated how the brain encodes the precision of predictions during a visual cueing task with high- and low-precision conditions. We focused on the key regions implicated in predictive processing: the insular cortex, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and primary visual cortex (V1). Behaviourally, participants showed significantly greater accuracy in the high-precision condition (p < .001), confirming effective task manipulation. DCM analyses revealed that high-precision predictions elicited excitatory modulation of connectivity from the insula to V1 (Pp = .95), alongside inhibitory influences from the insula to the pulvinar (Pp = .99) and from the pulvinar to V1 (Pp = .89). Furthermore, leave-one-out cross validation revealed that individual differences in behavioural sensitivity to precision were positively predicted by pulvinar-to-insula connectivity (r = .36, p = .026) and negatively predicted by the connectivity between pulvinar and V1 (pulvinar to V1: r = .35, p = .033; V1 to pulvinar: r = .37, p = .026), highlighting the behavioural relevance of these pathways. Together, these findings suggest a dual-route mechanism whereby the insula directly enhances top-down predictions in V1 while indirectly dampening bottom-up sensory input via the pulvinar.

We hypothesized that reduced temporal presence would result in diminished behavioral and electrophysiological empathic responses. However, observer's behavioral empathic responses were not diminished with reduced temporal presence. On a neural level, mid-frontal theta was sensitive to the other's pain intensity, and we observed significant physiological coupling between participants. Mu suppression, on the other hand, was not modulated by pain intensity. Importantly, neural and physiological indices of empathy were independent of temporal presence. However, exploratory analyses indicated a latency effect of temporal presence on pain-related theta activity with an earlier theta increase in interactions with high temporal presence.

However, the specific metabolic adaptations driven by fructose in prostate cancer (PCa) remain unexplored.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the metabolic consequences of chronic fructose exposure in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC-3) PCa cell lines. We evaluated the expression, localization, and function of the fructose transporter Glut-5 and assessed metabolic fluxes, enzyme expression, lipid accumulation, and global metabolite profiles using molecular, imaging, and metabolomic approaches.\n\nResultsGlut-5 was primarily localized to early endosomes under basal and fructose-stimulated conditions, suggesting a non-canonical role potentially consistent with transceptor function. Chronic fructose exposure significantly upregulated Glut-5 expression and enhanced fructose uptake, but did not alter substantially its subcellular localization. Functionally, fructose reduced lactate production and mitochondrial ATP output, indicating a metabolic shift away from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. In LNCaP cells, fructose induced robust activation of de novo lipogenesis (DNL), evidenced by upregulation of FASN and G6PD, increased lipid droplet accumulation, and enhanced levels of key fatty acid metabolites (e.g., TG, EPA, DHA).

J.; Volf, P.; Gluenz, E.; Albuquerque-Wendt, A.", "abstract": "Leishmania amastigotes ingested by female phlebotomine sand flies are exposed to a harsh and dynamic environment, markedly different from that of their mammalian host. Within the sand flys alimentary tract, these parasite forms encounter shifts in temperature, pH and nutrient availability, which trigger significant morphological and physiological adaptations. Membrane transporter proteins, channels and pumps play a crucial role in facilitating the movement of solutes across eukaryotic membranes. Previously, a systematic loss-of-function screen of the L. mexicana \"transportome\" identified forty transporter deletion mutants that caused significant loss of fitness in macrophage and mouse infections. Here, using an independently generated library of over 300 barcoded gene deletion mutants, we monitored their growth fitness for seven days in vitro and tested which transporters are required for Leishmania promastigotes to successfully colonise Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies for nine days. Overall, fitness scores correlated between promastigotes from long-term in vitro culture and in vivo sand fly infections. More importantly, for 34 mutants, a significant loss of fitness was observed exclusively in vivo. Moreover, deletion of the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) proved detrimental for parasite persistence and promastigote differentiation in the sand fly, uncovering a key role for the V-ATPase at different stages throughout the Leishmania life cycle.\n\nAuthor SummaryLeishmania parasites cause leishmaniases - a group of neglected tropical diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. These parasites must survive in two radically different environments: inside a mammalian host and within the gut of a blood-feeding sand fly. To thrive in the sand fly, Leishmania undergo extensive physiological changes and depend on transporter proteins to move nutrients and other molecules across their cell membranes. In this study, we focused on identifying which of these transporters are critical for the parasites survival inside the sand fly. We used a genetically engineered library of Leishmania promastigotes - the parasite form adapted to the insect vector - to assess the importance of more than 300 different transporter genes. We discovered that 34 of these transporters are essential for successful colonization of the sand fly. Among them, one key protein complex - the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) pump - was found to be crucial for parasite survival in the insect vector. Our findings deepen our understanding of how Leishmania adapts to life within the sand fly and highlight potential molecular targets for disrupting its transmission.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we explored the behavioral and neurophysiological basis of spatial appetitive EL, as well as renewal failure and renewal success. We recorded place cell activity from hippocampal area CA1 in male rats that performed a context-dependent spatial appetitive learning task in a T-maze (rewarded context A), followed by EL (unrewarded context B), and subsequent renewal testing (unrewarded context A). Half of the animals exhibited significant renewal (renewers) and the other half failed to renew (non-renewers). Our findings reveal fundamental differences in learning strategies between groups revealed by differences in both spatial behavior and in place cell activity during both initial acquisition and subsequent EL. Specifically, renewers exhibited a context-based EL strategy, whereas non-renewers followed a goal-directed strategy. The spatial distribution of hippocampal place cell activity differed significantly between groups, indicating the hippocampus' role in the learning processes. Furthermore, renewers exhibited a greater extent of global remapping of place cells compared to non-renewers, consistent with predictions by our computational modeling. This suggests that global remapping serves as a key neural mechanism underlying effective renewal, allowing for the segregation of distinct memories and preventing the generalization of extinction. Our results highlight how hippocampal place cell dynamics during acquisition and EL predict later behavioral renewal outcomes, providing critical insights into the neural basis of memory updating and contextual control over learned behaviors.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

While none of the peptides significantly altered endothelial migration by themselves, full-length COL(I) increased cell migra-tion, which was selectively inhibited by COL(I)-derived Peptide 1 (229NGDDGEAGKPGRPGERGPpGp249).

However, questions remain about how copper distribution changes under dynamic conditions like tissue differentiation. We previously reported that the copper exporter ATP7A is required for skeletal myoblast differentiation and that its expression changes in a differentiation dependent manner. Here, we sought to further understand the ATP7A-mediated copper export pathway by examining ATOX1, the copper chaperone that delivers copper to ATP7A. To investigate the role of ATOX1 in a dynamic cellular context, we characterized its binding partners during myoblast differentiation using the proximity labeling protein APEX2 to biotinylate proteins near ATOX1.

Using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), we quantified CC states across various suspension and adherent cell lines and stimulated primary human T cells. Our approach captures the diversity of scCC states, including atypical molecular signatures that do not meet the canonical definitions of CC phases in the literature. Multiplexing with pharmacologically-induced CC arrest reveals that drug-induced CC perturbations can exacerbate reported noncanonical states and induce previously unobserved states. Notably, cells escaping CC inhibitor action in primary cells demonstrated more aberrant CC states compared to their untreated counterparts.

The recently identified Tm-binding site 3 in the highly conserved C-terminal end segment of TnT has a troponin I (TnI)-like inhibitory function. Conformational modulation by proteolytic removal of the N-terminal variable region of cardiac TnT (cTnT-ND) in adaptation to inotropy-afterload mismatch enhances the function of Tm-binding site 3 to adjust ventricular contractile kinetics and sustain stroke volume. Mutations in this segment of cTnT cause overactivation of cardiac muscle and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Methods: The C-terminal end 14 amino acid peptide of cTnT (cTnT-C14) was analyzed for interactions with Tm, F-actin, and F-actin-Tm thin filament using localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Wild-type and HCM mutant cTnT-C14 peptides were used to treat skinned cardiac muscle strips from wild-type and cTnT-ND transgenic mice to assess the effect on Ca2-activation of contraction. Results: cTnT-C14 peptide showed saturable binding to Tm and F-actin in LSPR with physiological affinity, which is significantly impaired by HCM mutation R278C, K280N or R286C. Treatment of wild-type mouse cardiac muscle strips with cTnT-C14 peptide produced a Ca2+-desensitization effect on myofilament activation, which was not seen with cTnT-ND mouse cardiac muscle strips implicating a prior utilization of the same mechanism. The HCM mutant peptides lost this function. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate the function of the cTnT C-terminal end segment underlying the pathophysiology of the HCM mutations. Its preserved functionality in the form of free peptide presents a drug candidate for the treatment of heart failure.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Studies have demonstrated persistent proinsulin secretion in individuals living with T1D, suggesting a processing impairment. Proinsulin is processed into mature active insulin by the prohormone convertases PC1/3, PC2, and carboxypeptidase E. We hypothesized that elevated circulating proinsulin-to-C-peptide (PI:C) ratios precede the onset of diabetes and are associated with reduced expression of PC1/3 in pancreatic beta cells. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were monitored for changes in plasma proinsulin, C-peptide, and beta cell Pc1/3 levels prior to diabetes onset. Female NOD mice that progressed to diabetes exhibited increased plasma proinsulin and PI:C ratios several weeks before the onset of diabetes compared to mice that remained normoglycemic. Plasma proinsulin levels were predictive of diabetes onset, with earlier elevations observed in mice that progressed to disease more rapidly. These increases in plasma proinsulin and PI:C ratios correlated with reduced beta cell Pc1/3 expression.

Human genetic data and functional experimentation have demonstrated that H2AK119ub is required for cortical development, however the molecular mechanism for this remains unknown. Here, we show that mouse embryos expressing catalytically deficient RING1B exhibit intact early neurogenesis but display impaired neuroectodermal fate restriction. Using in vivo, primary, and in vitro models, we demonstrate that reduced H2AK119ub leads to ectopic activation of lineage-inappropriate transcriptional programmes, including mesodermal and endodermal gene expression during neural differentiation. This transcriptional deregulation is not solely attributable to H2AK119ub or H3K27me3 loss but instead reflects sensitisation of PRC1 target genes to inappropriate transcription factor (TF)-mediated activation. Synthetic induction of candidate TFs, including GATA6, SOX7, and SNAI1, phenocopies the fate-skewing effects of PRC1 catalytic dysfunction, confirming their causal role. Our results uncover a buffering role for PRC1-catalysed H2AK119ub in safeguarding neural progenitor identity by preventing inappropriate TF-driven transcription and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variability observed in Polycomb-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Bd surveillance of Yosemite toads (Anaxyrus canorus) during their first year of life showed that: (a) detectable Bd infections were nearly absent in the tadpole stage and immediately after metamorphosis, (b) Bd prevalence and intensity gradually increased during the first two months of post-metamorphic growth, and (c) Bd prevalence and intensity increased four-fold in toads during the first winter dormancy. High prevalence and intensity of Bd infections after winter dormancy was observed in yearling toads across two consecutive years and was much higher than that observed in aquatically breeding adults during the same timeframe. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence from wild amphibians that Bd proliferates during terrestrial winter dormancy. This discovery calls for a reconsideration of the seasons enabling the proliferation and persistence of Bd and identifies recently metamorphosed hosts as overwinter Bd reservoirs.

This prolonged domestication has led to phenotypic adaptations that distinguish A. oryzae from its wild relative, Aspergillus flavus. While genomic and phenotypic differences between these species have been partially characterized, their comparative production of volatile compounds during food fermentation remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluated alpha-amylase activity, aflatoxin production, taste attributes (via electronic tongue), and volatile profiles (via dynamic headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of the food-grade strain A. oryzae RIB40 and two wild A. flavus strains, NPK13tox and AflaGuard. A. oryzae RIB40 exhibited significantly higher alpha-amylase activity during rice fermentation, and only A. flavus NPK13tox produced aflatoxin. Sensory analysis revealed that rice fermented by A. oryzae RIB40 exhibited more favorable taste attributes, including significantly lower astringency, aftertaste, and bitterness, as well as significantly higher richness (defined as umami aftertaste). Additionally, A. oryzae RIB40 produced a greater number and higher concentrations of volatile compounds, with 20 compounds significantly elevated compared to rice fermented by A. flavus. Many of these volatiles, including 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol, 3-octen-2-one, 2-methyl-butanal, and 3-methyl-butanal, are associated with pleasant sensory attributes and have previously been linked to A. oryzae-fermented foods. These findings suggest that the volatilome of A. oryzae RIB40 has been shaped by domestication to produce a more desirable sensory profile, enriched in alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and heterocyclic compounds contributing fruity, umami, and malty notes.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Previously, we reported that natural variation in heat tolerance is life-stage specific in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that thermal selection predominantly targets the early embryonic life stage. Here, we used advanced introgression and pooled whole-genome resequencing to map the genomic basis of enhanced embryonic heat tolerance in a neotropical line of D. melanogaster. We identified two loci on chromosomes 2R and X that were consistently targeted by 16 generations of thermal selection across six replicate introgressions. We compared alleles in these regions to published datasets of natural variation from North America and Europe using the DEST dataset. This analysis revealed that two SNPs associated with embryonic heat tolerance exhibited both clinal and seasonal patterns, with the seasonal variation significantly correlated with environmental variability in average precipitation and temperature variance across space and time. The two SNPs lie in the putative regulatory regions of the genes SP70 and sog, and individuals with different alleles at these loci exhibited disparate gene expression responses to heat stress. Overall, our results suggest that loci that influence embryonic heat tolerance are under selection in nature. Our study extends previous work in developmental genetics of Drosophila by characterizing the genomics of an ecologically relevant developmental trait in natural populations.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

The presence of Tau/TDP-43 co-pathology is associated with increased disease severity, although the causal relationship remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that Tau and TDP-43 mutually promote each other's condensation through direct interaction in vitro, forming irregularly shaped or multiphasic co-condensates with lower TDP-43 mobility, but higher Tau dynamics. While Tau promotes TDP-43 aggregation in vitro, TDP-43 suppresses formation of Tau fibrils and instead causes formation of oligomeric Tau and Tau/TDP-43 species. These co-assemblies hinder Tau seeding in a biosensor assay specific for proteopathic Tau seeds. Consistent with this data, SarkoSpin extracts from AD brains with Tau/TDP-43 co-pathology exhibit reduced Tau seeding compared to Tau-only AD brains. In contrast, patient-derived extracts from AD brains with Tau/TDP-43 co-pathology are highly potent in seeding TDP-43 neoaggregates in a TDP-43 reporter cell line.

We developed a computational pipeline to analyze bulk RNA-seq data from 54 human tissues and constructed tissue-specific co-expression networks for 30 core BAF complex genes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Louvain clustering identified gene modules for each tissue, which we compared to 46 curated BAF subcomplex gene sets using Jaccard similarity. In metabolically active non-endocrine tissues (kidney, skeletal muscle, vasculature, fibroblasts), we observed strong co-expression with canonical BAF (cBAF) and polybromo-associated BAF (pBAF) modules. Central nervous system tissues were dominated by neuron-specific BAF (nBAF) modules. Endocrine tissues (e.g., thyroid, adrenal) and gastrointestinal epithelia displayed co-expression profiles resembling smooth muscle like BAF and pBAF modules, suggesting chromatin programs that integrate hormone secretion with contractile and barrier functions. These patterns show that each tissue exhibits a distinct, non-random combination of BAF subcomplexes, potentially reflecting its functional chromatin state. Our results demonstrate that tissue-specific gene expression profiling can reveal differences in protein complex regulation. The modular deployment of BAF chromatin remodeling complexes appears tailored to the functional demands of each organ.

A phylogenetic analysis is carried out across all known CLC genes to expand the classification to include 569 channel and 1,051 transporter homologs that have been modeled. Using distance matrices, we validate AlphaFold2's ability to detect subtle structural differences among experimentally determined CLCs and use a random forest classifier to predict CLC channel vs. transporter sub-types to learn the structural changes that are the most important in the decision. The structural changes identified overlap with and contextualize the changes observed in experimental structures, expanding structural information across sequence space. The highest ranked change includes a contraction of distances between dimerization interface helices H, I, P & Q relative to the subunit core in the channel sub-types.

Within the framework of cellular mechanobiology, magnetic rotational spectroscopy (MRS), which employs rotating magnetic wires to probe cytoplasmic rheology, has emerged as an effective method for quantifying intracellular viscoelasticity. This study examines microrheology data from three breast epithelial cell lines, MCF-10A, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231, along with new data from HeLa cervical cancer cells. Here, MRS is combined with finite element simulations to characterize the flow field induced by wire rotation in the cytoplasm. COMSOL simulations performed at low Reynolds numbers show that the flow velocity is highly localized around the wire, and display characteristic dumbbell-shaped profiles. For wires most representative of MRS cell experiments, the shear rates are such that their product with the cytoplasmic relaxation time remains below 1, ensuring a linear flow regime. This outcome confirms that MRS can reliably measure the static viscosity of the intracellular medium in living cells. Nonlinear mechanical responses are predicted only in rare cases involving very short wires. This study demonstrates that integrating MRS intracellular measurements with COMSOL simulations significantly improves the reliability of in vitro assessments of cytoplasmic mechanical properties.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Although PRC2 complex expression increases during this transformation, its functional role has remained unclear. Using CRISPR-based autochthonous immunocompetent GEMMs, we demonstrate that inactivation of EED, the core PRC2 scaffolding subunit, impairs SCLC tumorigenesis and drives histological transformation from ASCL1-positive SCLC to LUAD through a transient NEUROD1-positive intermediate state. Mechanistically, EED loss de-represses bivalent genes co-marked by H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, including LUAD oncogenic RAS, PI3K, and MAPK pathway genes, to promote transformation to LUAD. Consistently, these same signaling genes are bivalently repressed in human SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, suggesting a conserved PRC2-dependent mechanism to repress LUAD lineage oncogenic signaling to maintain the SCLC neuroendocrine identity. In a complementary EGFR-mutant LUAD GEMM with RB1/TP53 inactivation, EED was required for LUAD-to-SCLC transformation and distant metastasis upon EGFR withdrawal. These findings identify the PRC2 complex as a key epigenetic enforcer of SCLC neuroendocrine identity and nominate EED inhibition as a potential strategy to block SCLC transformation in high-risk LUAD.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

With the increasing incidence of C. albicans infection and limited treatment strategies, the identification of new drug targets and inhibitor molecules is of global concern. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Fun30 from C. albicans (CaFun30) mediates DNA end-resection during DNA double-strand break repair. It also transcriptionally co-regulates the expression of DNA damage response genes and genes involved in white-opaque switching. The gene is not essential for viability; however, the null mutant shows increased sensitivity to genotoxic agents. We hypothesised that the protein could be a potential therapeutic target against C. albicans. The structural model of CaFun30 was generated using homology modelling. Screening of a small molecule library identified 10 potential molecules, of which F1853-0039 was found as the lead inhibitor candidate. In vitro studies showed that the molecule had an MIC in the micromolar range against C. albicans with minimal effect on human THP-1 cells.

Here, using confocal microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent sensors targeted to mitochondria and cytosol, we visualized beat-to-beat ATP dynamics in ventricular myocytes from adult male and female mice. These probes showed fluctuations in mitochondrial ATP levels with each contraction, revealing two distinct, spatially localized waveforms--ATP ''gain'' and ATP ''dip''--representing transient increases or decreases in matrix ATP levels, respectively. These waveforms were tightly phase-locked to intracellular Ca2+ transients and organized into energetic microdomains. Although female myocytes exhibited larger local mitochondrial ATP transients than their male counterparts, their total mitochondrial volume was lower. Female myocytes also exhibited tighter coupling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and showed a higher concentration of mitofusin 2 and ATP synthase catalytic -subunit per unit volume, suggesting more efficient ATP production. Cytosolic ATP transients mirrored mitochondrial waveforms and domain structure in both male and female myocytes. During faster pacing, diastolic cytosolic ATP rose more rapidly in female myocytes, whereas the accompanying beat-locked ATP transients increased in both sexes but did so proportionally more in males than in females. These findings demonstrate that ATP is synthesized on demand--beat by beat--in a modular, microdomain-specific manner. We propose that male myocytes rely on greater mitochondrial mass for energetic scaling, whereas female cells employ architectural precision to optimize ATP delivery.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

In a wild amphibian (green frogs, Pelophylax sp.), captured in several ponds with different salinity, GFAP was detected in plasma. Males from more saline ponds exhibited higher plasmatic GFAP levels, independent to their blood osmolality, suggesting that plasmatic GFAP-level reflects cerebral response to osmotic challenge. Plasmatic-GFAP correlated with immune markers (hemoglobin binding proteins, lymphocytes, neutrophils and monocytes), size and body condition, reinforcing its role as a physiological biomarker. We also highlighted that captivity had a significant effect on plasmatic-GFAP levels with sex-specific dynamics, masking the response to a short-term experimental salinity exposure.

G.; Yu, Z.-X.; Natanson, C.", "abstract": "Introduction/Purpose During the septic cardiomyopathy, the mechanism and relationship to outcome of changes in left ventricular (LV) end diastolic volume (EDV) and ejection fraction (EF) remains obscure. We compared serial changes in LVEF and LVEDV to successive alterations in LV wall ultrastructure, water content, and total mass to investigate whether these measures can explain their basis. Methods We performed cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 0,6,18,30,42,54, and 92h post-bacterial challenge in a large-animal model (n=57) that mimics human septic cardiomyopathy. LV tissue was obtained for electron microscopy (EM) upon death and 66h in sacrificed survivors. Results Between 0-6h post-challenge, LV compliance and EDV reached its greatest decline. Non-survivors (n=18) exhibited significantly greater reductions in LVEDV, along with more myocyte edema, mitochondrial swelling and myofilament fragmentation on EM. This increased tissue damage may explain why non-survivors developed worse LV compliance and a greater decline in LVEDV, which persisted until death. From 6-30h, LVEDV significantly improved to baseline in non-survivors, while survivors experienced ~20% increases (n=39). Concurrently, there was significant LV mass loss and increases in percent water content that were significantly associated with increases in LVEDV. This is consistent with a passive mechanism for rapidly improving LV compliance and EDV. Full recovery of EF required additional days. We hypothesize the prolonged significant mass loss over 5d reflects an active process for remodeling fragmented myofilaments, eliminating myocyte edema, and mitochondrial swelling, ultimately restoring contractile function. Conclusion The septic cardiomyopathy constitutes a diffuse ultrastructural injury to myocytes with three phases. Initially, there is a decrease in LVEDV, and EF due to myocyte damage within 6h of bacterial challenge; next, the patient sees a passive LVEDV recovery from 6-30h, where LV mass loss increases relative wall percent water content, which facilitates wall compliance and LVEDV; and lastly, the patient sees mass loss beyond 30h consistent with an active repair mechanism of myocytes, returning systolic function to normal. Therefore, EDV changes are a pathophysiological biomarker for sepsis outcomes. A lower LVEDV indicates persistent unrepairable ultrastructure damage with worsening wall compliance and poorer outcomes. LVEDV dilation is a sign of near-full recovery of ultrastructure injury, augmenting wall compliance and improving outcomes.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a promising translational biomarker for FXS pathophysiology, yet prior research has predominantly focused on male cohorts. In the widely used C57Bl/6J (B6) mouse strain, male Fmr1 knockout (KO) models show increased absolute gamma power at both juvenile and adult stages, which may reflect cortical hyperexcitability. In contrast, little is known about female Fmr1 KO mice, except that they exhibit no gamma alterations in adulthood. This gap hinders understanding of sex-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories of EEG profile in FXS. Leveraging the genetic stability and translational relevance of the B6 strain, this study compares EEG profiles between juvenile female Fmr1 KO and wild-type (WT) B6 mice to address this critical gap. Methods: Frontal-parietal differential EEG was recorded in freely behaving mice using the Open-Source Electrophysiology Recording system for Rodents. Neural activity was analyzed across three recording conditions: in the home cage, light-dark arena, and open field arena. Computed metrics included absolute/relative power, peak alpha frequency, theta-beta ratio, phase-amplitude coupling, amplitude-amplitude coupling, and multiscale entropy to assess signal complexity. Results: In all recording conditions, Fmr1 KO mice exhibited reduced absolute power in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands compared to WT controls. Relative power analysis revealed decreased alpha activity alongside increased gamma-band power, including both low and high gamma, in the KO mice. Cross-frequency coupling was disrupted, with diminished alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling. Amplitude-amplitude coupling between theta or alpha and gamma power displayed distinct changes in different recording conditions. Peak alpha frequency and theta-beta ratio were both reduced or unchanged in the KO mice, depending on the recording condition. Finally, EEG signal complexity remained comparable between the two genotypes across the conditions. Behaviorally, KO mice displayed hyper-exploration in the open field test, characterized by increased center time and entries. However, no overall robust correlations between EEG power in different frequency bands and behavioral parameters in the open field test were observed. Discussion and Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that juvenile female Fmr1 KO mice on a B6 background exhibit EEG alterations highly consistent with those reported in FXS patients, particularly increased gamma and reduced alpha power. The robust increase in gamma activity reinforces its status as a reliable biomarker across preclinical and clinical studies, while alpha reductions and slowed peak alpha frequency implicate thalamocortical network involvement.

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), altered sensory processing may contribute to increased vulnerability to such conditions. To better understand this relationship, we evaluated autonomic and behavioral responses to tactile, nociceptive, and social stressors in juvenile Wistar rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA), a widely used animal model of ASD. VPA-treated and saline-treated control (CTL) rats underwent a battery of stress-related behavioral tests. Defecation, freezing and vocalization behaviors were analyzed in response to handling, electro-tactile stimulation, nociceptive foot shock (fear conditioning) and social stress stimuli (emotional contagion). VPA-treated rats maintained increased defecation during handling and a higher prevalence of defecation during electro-tactile stimulation, without corresponding changes in freezing. During fear conditioning, these animals showed delayed onset and heightened freezing responses. Furthermore, unlike CTL rats, VPA-treated rats lacked correlations among freezing, defecation, and vocalization. In the emotional contagion paradigm, observation of shock in the partner increased the prevalence of animals freezing and reduced the prevalence of animals vocalizing in both VPA and CTL groups (oV+ and oC+) compared to their respective controls (oV- and oC-). However, these effects were more sustained in oV+ rats, which also exhibited prolonged freezing behavior and an earlier reduction in vocalization rate. These findings indicate that VPA-treated rats display heightened stress reactivity, habituation deficit and disrupted coordination of fear responses, supporting the VPA model as a relevant tool for investigating the neurobiological basis of stress vulnerability and social dysfunction in ASD.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we applied intersectional ablation and chemogenetic approaches to dissect the distinct roles of calbindin-expressing (CALB1+) and non-expressing (CALB1-) DA neurons in locomotion. Using newly engineered intersectional constructs, we ablated CALB1+ or CALB1- DA neurons in the mouse midbrain. Loss of either subtype led to pronounced deficits in the initiation and vigor of voluntary movements, as demonstrated by a reduction in peak speed, acceleration and deceleration of locomotor bouts. Notably, only CALB1- ablation disrupted locomotor learning. Beyond these functional effects, we observed that selective ablation of CALB1 DA neurons induced local microglial activation and was followed by a non-cell-autonomous loss of CALB1- DA neurons, suggesting that CALB1- neurons are more vulnerable to inflammation triggered by CALB1 neuron loss. We then confirmed these findings by performing acute inhibition of either population using inhibitory DREADD hM4Di. CALB1- DA neurons inhibition impaired the initial acquisition of locomotor learning, whereas inhibition of CALB1+ DA neurons disrupted the retention of acquired motor skills from previous days. Moreover, inhibition of CALB1+ DA neurons further impaired the initiation and amplitude of voluntary movements, as well as the velocity and acceleration/deceleration of locomotor bouts. Together, these findings provide causal evidence for functional specialization among molecularly distinct midbrain DA subtypes and reveal new aspects of mesostriatal circuit organization underlying locomotion and motor memory.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Thus, improved WM performance with meaningful objects could reflect enhanced contributions from episodic long term memory (LTM), a memory system that is highly vulnerable to PI, rather than an increase in WM capacity. To examine this issue, Experiment 1 measured WM capacity for repeated colors, repeated meaningful objects, and trial-unique meaningful objects. We replicated the previously observed advantage for trial-unique objects over colors. Critically, this advantage was eliminated entirely with repeated meaningful objects that equated PI across the meaningful and simple stimuli, suggesting that minimal PI, not meaningfulness, drove this behavioral effect. In line with this hypothesis, hierarchical Bayesian dual-process signal detection modeling suggested that the advantage for trial-unique objects was due to enhanced familiarity-based LTM signals rather than recollection-based WM processes. To directly measure online storage in WM, Experiment 2 measured contralateral delay activity (CDA), an electrophysiological marker of the number of items stored in working memory. Although we saw the typical performance benefits for trial-unique objects over repeated colors, CDA activity across increasing set sizes revealed a common plateau for trial-unique meaningful objects and repeated colors, indicating a WM storage limit that is independent of stimulus meaningfulness. Thus, past demonstrations of superior memory performance with meaningful stimuli can be explained by a task design that minimized PI for meaningful compared to simple stimuli. When PI is equated, WM storage limits for simple and meaningful stimuli are equivalent.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

C.; Lukinova, E.", "abstract": "This preregistered fMRI study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying intertemporal choices involving waiting and postponing. On a behavioral level, choices made regarding rewards available in seconds that require waiting compared to choices about rewards postponed to a number days are surprisingly similar. The explanation to this short/long time scales gap is lacking even after considering time perception and external factors, such as stress. To address that this study is the first to examine the overlapping and distinct neural circuitry involved in the intertemporal choices over seconds and days, and the waiting period within subject. Our results revealed considerable overlap in brain activation during choices that consider seconds and days delays to reward in the executive control (dACC, dlPFC) and prospection (PCC/precuneus, dmPFC) networks, but not in the valuation network. Consistent with existent literature we found the valuation network activation (both vmPFC and ventral striatum) being parametrically modulated by individual subjective values of delayed rewards. Overall, the key network determined through representational similarity and decoding analyses was prospection accounting for similarity in activation during decision making across time scales of delays and discriminating between waiting and postponing the reward. These findings enhance our understanding of the neural underpinnings of intertemporal choices and their implications for real-life decisions occurring across varying time horizons, such as paying to skip advertisements while watching videos or deciding on the next-day delivery service.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Previous work in the field has described phasic inhibition arising primarily from molecular layer interneuron-PC (MLI-PC) synapses extensively, however little work explores other sources of inhibition in PCs. Several types of neurons throughout the brain and within the cerebellum receive significant inhibition through tonic currents, a low amplitude current resulting from ambient GABA acting upon extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Through the use of ex vivo electrophysiology and single cell RNA analysis, we investigated the role of tonic inhibition in PCs. We find that PCs have a significant tonic current mediated by {delta}-subunit containing GABAA receptors, which accounts for roughly half of the total inhibitory current. We also examined PC tonic GABA currents in DMDmdx mice, a mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy with ~50% reduction in phasic inhibitory currents. We find that tonic inhibition is dramatically upregulated in DMDmdx PCs, suggesting a possible compensatory mechanism to account for the loss in phasic inhibition. Furthermore, roughly 80% of the total inhibition is derived from tonic currents in this condition. These data suggest that under physiological conditions, PCs are subject to both tonic and phasic inhibition, and that adjustments in the balance of inhibition may be a physiological mechanism for PC function. These data reveal an expanded range of inhibitory currents in PC which may be critical to regulating PC activity in both normal and pathophysiological states.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Tuberculous pleural effusion (TB-PE), a common extrapulmonary manifestation that frequently coexists with pulmonary TB, offers a unique, clinically relevant immunometabolic window into the TB microenvironment. Here, using patient-derived TB-PE samples, we demonstrate that this microenvironment induces a metabolic state in human macrophages that compromises their antimicrobial function. Lipidomic analysis identified an enrichment of the specialized pro-resolving mediator Resolvin D5 (RvD5), which signals through GPR32 to suppress macrophage microbicidal activity. The acellular fraction of TPE was sufficient to induce RvD5 secretion by monocytes, correlating with increased expression of RvD5 biosynthetic enzymes in pleural monocytes from TB patients. Mechanistically, RvD5-GPR32 signaling inhibited glycolysis without promoting oxidative phosphorylation, reducing HIF-1 activity and impairing intracellular M. tuberculosis control. HIF-1 stabilization restored antimicrobial function.

We used isoform-specific Lyn knockout mice (LynAKO and LynBKO) to interrogate the contribution of each isoform to TLR signaling in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bulk RNA sequencing and cytokine analyses revealed that complete Lyn deficiency (LynKO) dampens TLR4- and TLR7-induced inflammatory gene expression and TNF production, but enhances the expression of genes responsible for synthesizing the extracellular matrix and promoting proliferation. Despite a reduction in total Lyn levels, the expression of either LynA or LynB alone was sufficient to preserve wild-type transcriptional responses and TNF production in response to the TLR7 agonist R848. However, LyAKO and LynBKO macrophages did have partially impaired TNF production in response to the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide. Additionally, LynAKO and LynBKO macrophages were hyperproliferative, like LynKO cells.

Loss of m6A at this site leads to reduced protein synthesis, disrupted expression of translation-related genes, and impaired zygotic genome activation and blastocyst formation.

While there is significant variation in social behaviors within and between species, the genetic mechanisms underlying natural variation in social behaviors are poorly understood. A central challenge to investigating the mechanisms contributing to the evolution of social behaviors is that these behaviors are typically complex, making them a challenge to quantify. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, is a powerful model for investigating the evolution of traits, as it is a single species that exists as populations of eyed, river-dwelling surface fish and blind cave-dwelling fish. The blind cavefish have evolved morphological and behavioral differences compared to surface fish, including reduced aggression. Here, we developed and validated an automated machine learning pipeline that integrates pose-estimation and supervised behavioral classification to track and quantify aggression-associated behaviors - striking, following, and circling. Using this pipeline, we established that these behaviors are quantitatively different between surface and cave fish during juvenile stages in A. mexicanus, similar to what was observed previously in adults. Moreover, assessment of these aggressive behaviors in surface-cave F2 hybrid fish revealed that striking and following are strongly positively correlated, while striking and circling are negatively correlated, suggesting that these behaviors evolved through some shared genetic mechanisms. These findings demonstrate the power of automated tracking and behavioral phenotyping in multiple fish in A. mexicanus and establish a foundation for future studies investigating the genetic basis of evolution of social behaviors.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

To answer this question, we used vector embeddings, which account for local contextual signals, to model the protein domain content of multidomain proteins. We observe that multidomain architectures that are semantically similar share more functional attributes than multidomain architectures selected based on domain content similarity, alone, suggesting that context is important for understanding the relationship between domain content and protein function. Surprisingly, vector semantics also identified multidomain architecture pairs with significantly high functional similarity, despite having no domains in common at all, suggesting that vector semantics may be discovering domain \"synonyms\".

Despite advances in understanding its genetic basis, the cellular heterogeneity, regulatory mechanisms, and microenvironmental interactions driving LAM progression remain poorly defined. In this study, we employed an integrative multi-omics approach combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-nucleus ATAC sequencing (snATAC-seq), and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics (Visium, Visium HD, and Xenium) to decode the LAM niche in its native environment. We identified two spatially and functionally distinct LAM subtypes: LAMCORE1 and LAMCORE2. LAMCORE1 cells exhibited a uterine smooth muscle-like phenotype, expressing associated markers (ACTA2, MYH11) and were enriched in MTORC1 signaling and myogenic pathways, supporting a uterine origin. In contrast, LAMCORE2 cells displayed fibroblast-like features, with upregulated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling genes (COL1A1, MMP11) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways, suggesting a role in niche formation. Pseudotime and regulon analyses revealed dynamic transitions between these subtypes, driven by distinct transcriptional networks (e.g., HOX/PBX in LAMCORE1, TWIST/ZEB in LAMCORE2). The presence of the two distinct LAM subtypes was further validated by RNAscope and immunofluorescence microscopy. We identified LAM-associated fibroblasts (LAFs) as activated stromal cells expressing canonical markers (FAP, S100A4, VIM, IGFBP7, SPARC) and localized within LAM lesions. Subpopulations of LAFs, LAF-seed (proximal to LAMCORE1) and LAF-niche (surrounding LAM niches), exhibited unique functional profiles, including ECM deposition, TGF-{beta} signaling, and myofibroblast activation. Regulatory network analysis pinpointed EGR1 as a central hub governing LAF phenotype. Our comprehensive spatial profiling revealed niche structures dominated by LAMCORE1 cells and surrounded by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), LAFs, scattered LAMCORE2 cells, macrophages, and reprogrammed alveolar epithelial cells (AT2). ECM remodeling and aberrant organization of cable-like structures (-smooth muscle actin+) of the LAM niches were further validated by second harmonic generation microscopy. These findings provide a high-resolution blueprint of LAM pathogenesis, highlighting the interplay between uterine-derived LAMCORE cells, activated fibroblasts, and the remodeled lung microenvironment.

This primary genetic cue is often located on a single locus, referred to as sex chromosomes, and can be limited to females (in a ZZ/ZW system) or males (in an XX/XY system). One trademark of sex chromosomes is a restriction or cessation of recombination surrounding the sex-limited region (to prevent its inheritance in the homogametic sex). This may lead to, through a variety of mechanisms, higher amounts of genetic divergence within this region, i.e. between the X/Z and Y/W chromosomes, especially when compared to their autosomal counterparts. Recent advances in genome sequencing and computation have brought with them the ability to resolve haplotypes within a diploid individual, permitting assembly of previously challenging genomic regions like sex chromosomes. Leveraging these advances, we identified replicable diagnostic characteristics between typical autosomes and sex chromosomes (within a single genome assembly). Under this framework, we can use this information to identify putative sex chromosome linkage groups across divergent vertebrate taxa and simultaneously curate misassembled regions on autosomes.

Traditional manufacturing methods for cell culture accessories involve injection molding and machining, which are too costly and time-consuming to implement for producing custom designs in small batches, and/or while testing the usefulness of a new design before mass producing it. Materials typically used for rapid design iteration, like poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomers, surmount this issue but present new challenges of affinity for hydrophobic small molecules and sub-optimal interactions with sensitive cell types. Here, we propose polycarbonate (PC) thermoforming as a solution for creating customized transparent and autoclavable accessories.

The use of high heat deflection temperature (HDT) resins allows these PC devices to be thermoformed off molds created by Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D prints, enabling rapid prototyping of the PC. Using this approach, we fabricated custom PC well plate inserts. These inserts combine many advantages of tissue culture polystyrene (negligible absorption of hydrophobic molecules, transparency, rigidity) and elastomers (ease of creating bespoke devices, ability to be sterilized by autoclaving) and are compatible with a variety of cell biology applications, including human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) culture.

This highlights the need for new in vitro models to investigate the interplay of mechanical loading and cell-substrate interactions. Therefore, this study introduces a tunable stretching chamber platform to simultaneously study both factors in AF degeneration. Methods: Tunable PDMS substrates were fabricated by adjusting ratios of Sylgard 184 and Sylgard 527, enabling molding into stretching chambers or well plates. Substrates underwent mechanical, optical and chemical characterization. Bovine AF cells were seeded onto the substrates and cultured under static conditions or subjected to cyclic strain (8% strain at 1 Hz). Substrate biocompatibility and cell morphology were assessed over 72 h in static cultures. Dynamic responses were assessed by cell viability and alignment. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was employed to assess surface strain in custom-designed and commercial (STREX) stretching chambers at strains between 8 to 20%. Results: PDMS formulations resulted in a stiffness (E modulus) range of 8.72 to 238.00 kPa, demonstrating distinct viscoelastic profiles. All substrate formulations supported AF cell adhesion and viability. DIC analysis revealed non-uniform axial and transverse strain distributions on membrane surfaces. Cyclic stretching showed that cells maintained viability up to 14 h. Additionally, cells responded to the applied strain by perpendicular alignment to the stretch axis at 6 h. Conclusions: The PDMS based stretching platform offers a biocompatible and tunable mechanical environment that mimics physiological and pathophysiological elastic properties. It enables systematic investigations on how elastic properties and mechanical strain modulate AF cell behavior in IVD disease progression.

Using AmyloGram, we analyzed 204 proteins tagged by humans as amyloidogenic in UniProt. We then applied the same approach to proteins identified in thrombi retrieved using mechanical thrombectomy from patients with cardioembolic and atherothrombotic stroke. In addition we used AmyloGram to analyse the amyloidogenicity of 83,567 canonical human protein sequences. Results: Among the UniProt-annotated \"amyloid\" set, nearly all proteins received AmyloGram scores above 0.7, including 23 of the 24 human proteins. Even the lowest-scoring human protein, lysozyme (scoring 0.675), is known to form amyloid under certain conditions. In thrombi from both stroke subtypes, all detected proteins had AmyloGram scores above 0.7, suggesting a high likelihood of amyloid content. A majority of unannotated proteins also achieve AmyloGram scores exceeding 0.7.

We developed computational models that generate boundaries based on prediction error or prediction uncertainty, and examined how both types of boundaries, and human-identified boundaries, related to fMRI pattern shifts and evoked responses. Multivariate analysis revealed a specific temporal sequence of neural pattern changes around human boundaries: early pattern shifts in anterior temporal regions (-11.9s), followed by shifts in parietal areas (-4.5s), and subsequent whole-brain pattern stabilization (+11.8s). The core of this dynamic response was associated with both error-driven and uncertainty-driven boundaries.

Although these neural systems and cognitive functions are separately distributed across the entire brain, they are functionally integrated together to perform a task. Decision-making and executive functioning may also be involved in performing the task. While studying task-evoked brain networks is important, investigating whole-brain activity could be crucial for understanding the neural underpinnings of individual behavioral and clinical traits. Even when the brain is not actively engaged in a task, the intrinsic neural activity, i.e., the resting-state (rs) activity, maintains the operations of the brain that involve the acquisition and maintenance of information for interpreting, responding to, and predicting environmental demands. This intrinsic activity is also functionally organized into networks like the brain default mode network. Investigating its whole-brain activity could also be crucial for understanding the neural underpinnings of the operations of the brain at rest. We report a novel data-driven method to objectively and automatically identify functional neural networks (FNNs) across the entire brain for both brain states measured with rs- and task-fMRI, respectively. The identified FNNs characterize the whole-brain activity holistically for each brain state and each individual subject.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Available therapies, aimed at increasing SMN protein levels, can only partially halt motor neuron (MN) degeneration in a select number of patients, reinforcing the need for combinatorial treatments to improve clinical outcomes. We previously showed that mTORC1 overactivation and impaired autophagosome clearance in SMA MNs lead to the accumulation of protein aggregates, contributing to MN degeneration. However, the mechanistic link between SMN protein deficiency and autophagy-lysosomal dysfunction remained unknown. Here, using patient iPSC-derived MNs along with isogenic and healthy controls, we show that SMA MNs exhibit reduced lysosome numbers and impaired functionality. Furthermore, the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, TFEB, is downregulated, and its nuclear translocation compromised upon SMN deficiency. We further propose the upregulation of the mTORC1 positive modulator TPT1 as contributor to TFEB dysregulation. Notably, TFEB overexpression ameliorates protein aggregate accumulation in SMA MNs and enhances MN survival both in vitro and in a zebrafish SMA model.

However, their auditory system is exposed to low-frequency noise from external sources, such as convective and thermal noise, and internal sources, such as flight-induced noise, which could impair sensitivity. High-pass filters (HPFs) may mitigate this issue by suppressing low-frequency interference before it is transformed into neuronal signals. We investigated HPF mechanisms in Culex pipiens mosquitoes by analyzing the phase-frequency characteristics of the primary sensory neurons in the Johnston's organ. Electrophysiological recordings from male and female mosquitoes revealed phase shifts consistent with high-pass filtering. Initial modeling suggested a single HPF; however, experimental data required revising the model to include two serially connected HPFs to account for phase shifts exceeding -90{degrees}. The results showed that male mosquitoes exhibit stronger low-frequency suppression (~32 dB at 10 Hz) compared to females (~21 dB), with some female neurons showing negligible filtering. The estimated delay in signal transmission was ~7 ms for both sexes. These findings suggest that HPFs enhance noise immunity, particularly in males, whose auditory sensitivity is critical for mating. The diversity in female neuronal tuning may reflect broader auditory functions in addition to mating, such as host detection. This study provides indirect evidence for HPFs in mosquito hearing and highlights sex-specific adaptations in auditory processing. The proposed dual-HPF model improves our understanding of how mosquitoes maintain high auditory sensitivity in noisy environments.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Spatial learning is typically cumulative, but little is known about how neuronal ensembles are manifested during this process. Here, we used wide-field Ca2+-imaging to monitor CA1 pyramidal cells during cumulative item-place learning in adult male CBA/CaOlaHsd mice. In control mice, initial learning prompted activity in a population of CA1 neurons, some of which re-appeared during re-exposure to the same item-place configuration 60 min after 1st exposure. Item-place reconfiguration (60 min later) caused a change in population dynamics as reflected by alterations in neuronal recruitment and reactivation patterns. Place cell-like properties, population burst activity, and functional connectivity were consistent with the encoding and updating of item-place memory. To examine the role of noradrenergic neuromodulation on these processes, we pharmacologically antagonized {beta}-adrenergic receptors({beta}-AR) prior to the 1st item-place exposure. This led to reduced cellular recruitment, disrupted ensemble reactivation, reduced spatial tuning, dampened population bursts, and altered functional connectivity within neurons. This was accompanied by impaired spatial learning compared to controls.

Deciphering the developmental programs whose dysregulation leads to T-ALL pathogenesis is critical for the development of novel targeted therapies, which remain an urgent unmet need for the treatment of this disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of numerous physiological processes and cancer. However, the specific role of miRNAs in human T-cell development and T-ALL pathogenesis remains largely unexplored. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated miRNA expression profiles across human T-cell development by microarray analysis and identified a dynamic expression pattern of miR-16-2, which is upregulated across early pre-T cell proliferative stages up to the resting stage of immature thymocytes immediately preceding TCR{beta} ; expression, and decreased thereafter. We confirmed the coordinated regulation of miR-15b expression, consistent with the reported clustered genomic location of both miRNAs. Notably, functional studies identified the miR-15b/16-2 cluster as a negative regulator of early thymocyte proliferation, and showed that overexpression of miR-15b/16-2 in T-ALL cells impaired leukemic growth in vitro and tumor progression in patient-derived xenotransplantation assays. Mechanistically, miR-15b/16-2 expression represses the genes encoding BCL-2 and CYCLIN D3, leading to T-ALL apoptosis and cell cycle dysregulation, with an accumulation of G0-phase cells and a defective transition to the G2/M phase.

Although over 190 genetic defects have been identified, effective treatments remain available for only a few. We hypothesized that integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets from individuals with various CDG could uncover common molecular signatures and highlight shared therapeutic targets. Methods: We compiled all publicly available RNA sequencing, proteomics and glycoproteomics datasets from patients with PMM2-CDG, ALG1-CDG, SRD5A3-CDG, NGLY1-CDDG, ALG13-CDG and PGM1-CDG, spanning different tissues, including induced cardiomyocytes, human cortical organoids, fibroblasts, and lymphoblasts. Differential expression and glycosylation analyses were performed, followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify commonly dysregulated pathways. We then applied the EMUDRA drug prediction algorithm to prioritize candidate compounds capable of reversing these shared molecular signatures. Results: We identified four glycoproteins with consistent differential glycosylation across all eight glycoproteomics datasets. Six glycosylation sites and glycan structures were recurrently altered across CDG and showed partial correction with treatment. Pathway analysis revealed shared disruptions in autophagy, vesicle trafficking, and mitochondrial function. EMUDRA predicted several repurposable drug classes, including muscle relaxants, antioxidants, beta-adrenergic agonists, antibiotics, and NSAIDs, that could reverse key pathway abnormalities, particularly those involving autophagy and N-glycosylation.

Cell-cell communication inference has now become routine in downstream scRNAseq analysis but this fails to capture physical cell-cell interactions due to tissue dissociation. Multiplets (mostly doublets) in scRNAseq may represent undissociated physically attached cells that become sequenced together. Hence, identifying multiplets may serve as a good starting point to harness scRNAseq data for physical cell-cell interaction inference. In this study, we develop a computational method which utilizes univariate linear models (ULM) to identify multiplets in scRNAseq datasets, predict their cellular compositions, and infer physical cell-cell interaction networks. Indeed, our method showed good sensitivity (~56%) with excellent precision (~99%) in predicting FACS sorted doublet cell pairs with known constituents (ground truth), recording comparable or superior performance over two other existing methods. Also, applying it to scRNAseq data of partially dissociated tissues containing real multiplets unraveled physical networks which recapitulated the microanatomical structures of the tested tissues. This further underscores the accuracy in our predictions to capture biologically meaningful interactions. Finally, we tested our method on classical scRNAseq datasets and obtained biologically reasonable results.

Despite its broad application over the past two decades, the effects of lipid composition on the production yield and size distribution of liposomes generated by the inverted emulsion method remain largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of phospholipid composition on the production yield and size distribution of liposomes generated using the inverted emulsion method.

We found that a 10% replacement of egg PC with charged phospholipids significantly enhances the production yield of liposomes by approximately tenfold, transformed by both the natural gravitational force and the greater force applied by centrifugation. In addition, lipids with smaller head groups slightly enhance the production yield in both methods.

In this study, we performed 1-microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of AlphaFold-modeled active and inactive MasR conformations, with and without Ang 1-7, to characterize ligand-induced conformational dynamics. Ang 1-7 binding led to increased interaction stability in the active state, reflected by higher occupancy of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic contacts. Structural analyses revealed reduced RMSD/RMSF values and stabilization of key transmembrane (TM) helices and the NPxxY micro-switch. TM distance and dihedral analyses indicated partial TM6 displacement and time-dependent NPxxY reorganization. Network-based metrics including betweenness centrality and shortest path length highlighted the emergence of state-specific communication hubs, while PCA, correlation and communication propensity analyses revealed enhanced conformational diversity and selective inter-residue signaling in the ligand-bound state. Molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) calculations showed favorable binding energetics in the active state ({Delta}GBind = -13.99 kcal/mol).

The pandemic preparedness pipeline emphasizes the importance of diagnostic surveillance of pathogens in at-risk populations to monitor transmission and mitigate the impact on public health. Unfortunately, the current gold standard diagnostic tool for Mpox is limited in its field applicability. Therefore, there is a crucial need for the development of robust novel diagnostic tools to enable continuous surveillance of the disease. As such, this work sought to design and validate novel multiepitope antigens as diagnostic tools for Mpox serosurveillance. Methods Using immunoinformatic approaches, two novel Mpox multiepitope antigens (MP-MEDA-1 and MP-MEDA-2) were designed using linear B-epitopes of viral proteins previously characterized in Mpox serodiagnosis. The 3D structures of the designed antigens were predicted, refined, and validated. Protein-protein docking and interaction analyses were performed between the designed diagnostic antigens and the Fab regions of human IgA, IgG, and IgM. Results The designed antigens were predicted to be antigenic and demonstrated thermostability with desirable physicochemical properties. In addition, both antigens also demonstrated stable interactions with the Fab regions of selected immunoglobulins, with several residues interacting at the interfaces of all the docked complexes.

M.; Langella, F.; Belmonte, R. L.; Mika, P.; Duneau, D.; Regan, J. C.", "abstract": "It is widely accepted that susceptibility to infection increases with age. The reason often invoked is the dysregulation of the immune system, which is both cause and consequence of ageing. However, we do not all age in the same way, and increased susceptibility may not be solely due to immune dysregulation affecting resistance to infection. There are many possible ways to make a host less tolerant to infection by dysregulating key physiological or metabolic processes. We hypothesised that the increase in susceptibility to infection over age can be linked to both immune ageing and decreased tolerance, and importantly, that it will depend on genotype and sex of the host. We assessed susceptibility to Gram-negative bacterial challenge in both sexes in 22 Drosophila isolines at young and old ages, and leveraged variation between genotypes to investigate how frequently an increase in susceptibility to infection was more associated with a decline in resistance or disease tolerance mechanisms. To achieve this, we assessed pathogen load to report on host immune decline. Strikingly, in most cases, greater infection susceptibility at old age was driven by reduced tolerance, although we also frequently identify cases that suffered bona fide immunosenescence, e.g. impaired resistance. We screened across bacterial pathogens during systemic and oral infections and found sex-specific signatures in survival in young and old individuals, but increased susceptibility with age occurred in both sexes. Pairing infection survival with lifespan data, we find that transcending genotype variation, susceptibility at old age predicts lifespan in males only, regardless of the existence or direction of sex bias in longevity. This work highlights that increased infection susceptibility is an early-arising ageing phenotype that occurs in both sexes, but only predicts lifespan in males, paralleling burgeoning evidence in mammals for male-biased effects of age on infection and its connection with mortality. Our data support a model where infection susceptibility increases with age following the same multiplicative pattern as organismal mortality, with existing failures making new failures more consequential. We propose that the term immunosenescence be used specifically to describe proven dysregulation of immune tissue resistance mechanisms. We argue that to fully understand the drivers of age-related susceptibility to infection, it is essential to consider genotype, sex, and their interaction, as well as the dysregulation of non-immune functions that influence the ability to control pathogens.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we perform a detailed molecular characterization of three recently isolated, distinct A. baumannii phages that breach the capsule via different mechanisms. Like many previously described A. baumannii phages, a specific capsule type is necessary and sufficient for StAb1 infection. We found that StAb2 and its relatives adsorb to either a specific capsule type or the conserved outer membrane protein CarO, a porin normally occluded by the capsule. Thus, this phage has a narrow host range amongst capsulated strains, but can broadly infect A. baumannii strains lacking capsule. We also show that an unclassified siphophage, StAb3, requires a conserved and uncharacterized glycan, likely containing ManNAc, that enables StAb3 to infect a broad range of A. baumannii strains without depolymerizing the capsule. We demonstrate how rationally combining phages with distinct capsule interactions reduces the rapid emergence of phage escape mutants, with potential applications for more effective phage therapy.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we use simulations across diverse scenarios, significantly varying niche structures and biotic interactions, to explore the experimental conditions and source microbiome characteristics that favor successful outcomes. Our results indicate that the effectiveness of this approach is constrained by several factors, and that perfect outcomes should not be routinely expected.

It is thus critical to better understand their immune system and mechanisms of antiviral immunity. Despite an increasing number of studies, much is still unknown about the molecular mechanisms that govern bat-virus interactions, especially given the large diversity of bat species. Dicer is a conserved ribonuclease with multiple activities that can modulate antiviral immunity, including the detection of viral RNA as part of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, the maturation of micro RNAs, and the direct inhibition of innate immunity in mouse and human cells. In view of these complex activities of Dicer, we tested its antiviral activity in Myotis myotis nasal epithelial cells. Surprisingly, we did not see strong evidence of RNAi in these cells, but instead saw a proviral effect of Dicer for two alphaviruses, Sindbis and Semliki forest virus. We also observed a striking relocalization of Dicer to cytoplasmic foci upon infection with these viruses, which did not occur in the several human cell lines we tested. These foci contained dsRNA and viral plus strand RNA, suggesting that they are sites of viral replication. Finally, we found that factors specific to M. myotis cells are needed for Dicer relocalization. Overall, we propose that Dicer can play different roles in different bat species and/or cell types, and is being repurposed by alphaviruses to promote viral replication.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Arbovirus genomes exhibit suboptimal codon usage for both human and mosquito hosts, raising questions about how they achieve efficient translation in such distinct cellular environments. Using chikungunya virus (CHIKV) as a model, we conducted a temporal, genome-wide analysis of transcription, translation, and tRNA modifications in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells. Unlike in human cells, CHIKV infection does not alter the tRNA modification landscape in mosquitoes to overcome codon bias, nor does it induce widespread degradation of host transcripts. Instead, viral persistence is marked by a progressive, virus-specific repression of CHIKV RNA translation, occurring alongside a recovery of host mRNA translation. This translational balance, maintained independently of the RNAi system, enables sustained viral production without major disruption to host gene expression. Our findings identify translational control as a central mechanism underlying persistent arbovirus infection in mosquito cells.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Due to its high complexity and energy-intensive firing process, regulation of the T6SS is tightly controlled in many organisms. Y. pseudotuberculosis encodes four complete T6SS clusters but lacks genes implicated in T6SS gene regulation in other microorganisms, indicating a distinct control mechanism. Here, we could show that the T6SS4 of Y. pseudotuberculosis is heterogeneously expressed within a population, which is determined by the transcriptional T6SS4 activator RovC. Moreover, the T6SS4 and RovC are embedded in a complex and global regulatory network, including the global post-transcriptional regulator CsrA, the Yersinia modulator A (YmoA), the global protease Lon, and RNases (PNP and RNase III). Post-transcriptional processing of the T6SS4 polycistron and different transcript stability within the operon also achieve a higher regulatory complexity.

Among these compounds, HP-29 demonstrates potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by inducing rapid iron starvation. As maintenance of trace metals homeostasis is critical for the survival of Streptococcus mutans, this study investigated the antimicrobial efficacy of HP-29 and the impact of metal supplementation on this major oral and occasional systemic pathogen. As anticipated, HP-29 inhibited S. mutans growth in a dose-dependent manner, with iron supplementation alleviating the antimicrobial effect. Cobalt, manganese, or nickel supplementation also mitigated the inhibitory activity of HP-29 but, unexpectedly, the addition of zinc greatly enhanced HP-29 antimicrobial activity. This zinc-driven potentiation of HP-29 extended to other Gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecalis and S. aureus. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis revealed that intracellular iron content decreased significantly following exposure to HP-29. At the same time, exposure to HP-29 led to a slight increase in intracellular zinc, mirroring the increase observed in cells exposed to excess zinc. When combined with zinc, HP-29 triggered a 5-fold increase in intracellular zinc and reduced manganese levels by about 50%. Transcriptome analysis showed that HP-29, with or without zinc, altered expression of genes linked to iron and manganese uptake as well as zinc efflux, suggesting broad disruption of metal ion regulation. These findings highlight HP-29 as a potent antimicrobial that broadly impairs metal homeostasis. The unexpected synergy of HP-29 with zinc points toward a promising dual-agent therapeutic strategy against Gram-positive pathogens.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Despite recent advances in sequencing technologies, obtaining complete Treponema pallidum genome sequences for epidemiological studies remains time-consuming and challenging due to the difficulty related to procuring clinical samples with sufficient treponemal burden to fulfil the sequencing requirements. There is an urgent need for rapid, cost-effective and accessible typing methods suitable for laboratories with Sanger sequencing resources. Based on the analysis of 121 T. pallidum genomes from geographically diverse regions, we selected seven highly variable genes to form the basis of this new typing system. These seven genes show high discrimination capacity, identifying many allelic profiles among T. pallidum isolates. Importantly, the scheme employs a single-step PCR protocol for the amplification and sequencing of all seven targets enabling straightforward implementation in standard laboratory settings. The MLST was validated using a diverse set of T. pallidum clinical samples from across the globe. A significant proportion of the tested samples showed macrolide resistance, emphasizing the need for epidemiological surveillance. Utilizing this new tool, we have analyzed the genetic variation within and between populations of T. pallidum, considering the geographical origin of the samples. Population structure analysis revealed distinct genetic clusters, underlining complex transmission dynamics of T. pallidum, shaped by local epidemiological factors. The MLST scheme is publicly accessible through the PubMLST database, encouraging widespread adoption in standard laboratories due to this database being user-friendly, intuitive, and fast to implement. The novel MLST scheme offers a promising tool to advance the study of the molecular epidemiology of T. pallidum, facilitate tracking transmission, and establish a global surveillance network with the overall goal of strengthening public health interventions for syphilis control.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Antivirulence strategies have emerged as an alternative to antibiotics for treating P. aeruginosa and other pathogens. One proposed antivirulence target is the prepilin peptidase PilD because of its centrality in two virulence mechanisms: the Type IV pili and the Type II Secretion System (T2SS). Substitution of invariant aspartic acids in the putative active site of PilD led to loss of peptidase activity in an in vitro cleavage assay and abrogation of both pilus-dependent twitching motility and T2SS-dependent protease secretion. Subsequently, this study utilized a simple Caenorhabditis elegans animal infection model to investigate the in vivo magnitude of the role of PilD on P. aeruginosa virulence.

An infection triggers a strong neutrophil-driven inflammatory response; however, viable gonococci are frequently recovered from neutrophil-rich patient exudates, indicating that these pathogens can survive neutrophil-mediated killing in vivo. To identify bacterial factors involved in this interaction, we screened a N. gonorrhoeae transposon library for mutants with reduced survival in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Among the identified candidates was NGFG_RS05085 (lutB), encoding an L-lactate oxidation FeS protein within the LutACB operon, which includes lutA (NGFG_RS05075), an FeS-binding protein, and lutC, the lactate utilisation protein C, (NGFG_RS05080). Deletion of lutA, lutB, or lutC did not significantly impair growth in standard culture medium or in minimal medium complemented with glucose, L-Lactate, or pyruvate. lutB and lutC, but not lutA, knockout significantly reduced bacterial survival within neutrophils compared to the wild-type strain. Polar effects of the mutations were ruled out by monitoring gene expression in deletion mutants. Metabolic profiling revealed disruption in nucleotide and glutathione synthesis, connecting the LutACB operon with sulfur metabolism, which could be required for a defence against neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Several human AurB inhibitors exhibited multistage potency (<250 nM) against all proliferative stages of parasite development, including asexual blood stages, liver schizonts and male gametes. Among the most potent compounds, hesperadin and AT83 exhibit >1000x selectivity towards the parasite without mammalian cell toxicity concerns.

Hesperadin's whole-cell and protein activity validates it as a unique PfArk1 tool compound. Inhibition of PfArk1 results in the parasite's inability to complete mitotic processes, presenting with unsegregated, multi-lobed nuclei caused by aberrant microtubule organization.

Recent evidence reveals that it forms a metapopulation consisting of three subpopulations: Northwestern, Southern, and Viking, highlighting the need to understand their distinct dynamics to support spatially targeted fisheries management. We applied a dynamical systems approach to quantify two key properties for each subpopulation from 1983 to 2023: dynamic stability, indicating whether subpopulations tend to return to or move away from their state each year, and the relative sensitivity of age groups, reflecting the magnitude of change in each group's abundance in response to perturbations in the age-structured interaction network. We found distinct dynamic stability patterns among the three subpopulations. The Northwestern subpopulation fluctuated between stable and unstable states before stabilizing at low abundance. The Southern subpopulation shifted from high-abundance, stable states toward low abundance at a transient with an uncertain future. The Viking subpopulation remained stable with relatively constant abundance over time. Throughout the study period, the age-1 group remained highly sensitive to perturbations in both the Southern and Viking subpopulations, whereas no single age group showed dominant sensitivity in the Northwestern subpopulation. Fishing mortality causally influenced the abundance and/or stability of the Northwestern and Southern subpopulations, but not the Viking subpopulation.

Although non-human primates reliably follow head gaze, their capacity to use eye gaze alone for inferring the other's focus of attention remains debated. We investigated this question using a realistic rhesus monkey head avatar that directed its gaze toward one of two LEDs (left or right), employing either eye movements alone or combined eye and head movements. After a randomly chosen interval (ranging 50-400 ms) from gaze presentation, one LED transiently increased its luminance to near-threshold levels. Rhesus monkeys were trained to detect and report this luminance change via a saccade to the corresponding LED, independent of the avatar's gaze direction, to receive rewards. Our results showed that head-gaze cues robustly directed covert attention toward gaze-congruent targets with short delays, indicative of reflex-like, stimulus-driven orienting. In contrast, eye gaze alone, at comparable amplitudes, did not affect attention shifts. However, increasing the avatar's size and eye-gaze amplitude, simulating a close-range interaction, made eye gaze cues effective in guiding attention. These findings demonstrate that rhesus monkeys possess the capacity to use eye-gaze cues to determine conspecifics' attentional targets, and validate and underscore the utility of 3D animal models as powerful tools for generating realistic yet precisely controlled stimuli.

Computational analyses showed that melanoma cells organise into spatially restricted patches, with a preferential organisation of undifferentiated cells associated with poor response to ICI.

Our account of harm-mitigating, neurobehavioural responses furnishes a mechanistic understanding of maladaptive behaviour and impaired belief-updating, which are often underspecified in conceptual analyses. Grounded in neurobiological evidence, we specify PTSD-related impairment in terms of Bayesian belief-updating, and establish an adaptive/maladaptive boundary using active inference and simulation studies.

To test this, we fine-tune monolingual and multilingual language models using brain activity recorded while bilingual participants read stories in English and Chinese.

F.", "abstract": "The hippocampus is a brain region involved in both emotion regulation and higher cognitive functions. Astrocytes have emerged as active modulators of synaptic activity, capable of sensing, integrating, and responding to neuronal signals. At glutamatergic synapses, astrocytes detect glutamate through the activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). However, most existing research has focused on the role of mGluR5 in developing rodents or in pathological contexts, likely because of the reported lower astrocytic mGluR5 expression levels in adulthood compared to postnatal stages. Importantly, prior studies and our preliminary data have demonstrated mGluR5-mediated signaling in astrocytes of adult mice, supporting a role for this receptor. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were (1) to determine whether these lower levels of mGluR5 are sufficient to activate astrocytes in the adult brain and (2) to investigate whether this activation is involved in regulating circuit function and behavior. To address these objectives, we evaluated adult mice employing a combination of calcium-imaging in astrocytes, and loss- and gain-of-function manipulations to assess synaptic plasticity and behavior in adult mice. First, we found that astrocytes of adult mice display fully functional mGluR5-dependent calcium activity. To examine the role of this activity, we induced the deletion of mGluR5 in astrocytes across the entire brain of adult mice. These mice developed anxious- and depression-like behaviors, along with reduced sociability and recognition memory, but showed increased behavioral flexibility. These results highlighted the hippocampus as a key region for mGluR5-mediated astrocytic influence on behavior, leading us to specifically target hippocampal astrocytes. A viral-driven ablation in this area demonstrated that astrocytic mGluR5 plays a role in both basal transmission and the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Behaviorally, the deletion of astrocytic mGluR5 in the hippocampus recapitulated anxious-like behaviors, social deficits, and impaired long-term recognition memory. Surprisingly, it improved place recognition memory but reduced behavioral flexibility. Lastly, overexpressing this receptor to enhance mGluR5 signaling specifically in hippocampal astrocytes impaired place recognition memory but improved behavioral flexibility, revealing a role for astrocytic mGluR5 in regulating these behaviors. Overall, our results confirmed the biological relevance of astrocytic mGluR5 during adulthood, specifically in modulating hippocampal function.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

Env cleavage stabilizes the pretriggered Env conformation (PTC), the major target for broadly neutralizing antibodies. Although the mature Env is relatively enriched in virions and virus-like particles (VLPs), conformationally flexible uncleaved Envs typically contaminate preparations of these particles. In non-permissive cells, the long ~149-residue gp41 cytoplasmic tail (CT) is necessary for Env incorporation into virions. In a minority of HIV-1 strains, the gp41 CT is clipped in virions by the viral protease. Here, we compare Envs with CT truncations and CT alterations that increase or decrease protease clipping in permissive cells. Changes in protease clipping affected amphotericin B sensitivity, but did not alter other viral phenotypes. By contrast, a corresponding CT truncation (L748STOP) increased cell-surface and virion Env levels, cell-cell fusion, and virus infectivity and cytotoxicity. Notably, in diverse HIV-1 strains, the ratio of cleaved/uncleaved Envs in preparations of virions and extracellular vesicles was increased by this CT truncation. ESCRT and ALIX-binding region (EABR) vesicles incorporated significantly more uncleaved CT-truncated Env than HIV-1 VLPs. Env CT deletion/truncation did not qualitatively alter the viral neutralization profile; however, increased antibody concentrations were required to neutralize viruses with the higher levels of cleaved Env that resulted from CT truncation. Specific CT truncations provide a means of enriching the PTC and limiting the incorporation of nonfunctional and conformationally heterogeneous uncleaved Envs into preparations of virions and VLPs.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

T4P are necessary for the bacteria to engage in surface-associated behaviors, including establishing acute infections. Pilus extension is driven by the hexameric ATPase, PilB, at the base of the T4P nanomachine in coordination with various protein regulatory effectors. The cyclic-di-GMP binding protein, FimX, works with PilB to mediate normal extension processes, though how this effector controls pilus assembly remains unclear. To explore the role of FimX in T4P function, we leveraged the significant {Delta}fimX twitching motility deficit to screen for mutants capable of overcoming this phenotype. We identified suppressor mutations that increase twitching in {Delta}fimX background, mapping primarily to cyclic-AMP homeostatic machinery or to PilB, the FimX target. Distinct suppressor mutations in PilB increased ATP hydrolysis in vitro and this activity was subject to modulation by FimX. Using microscopy to monitor the extension dynamics of fluorescently labelled T4P, we showed that {Delta}fimX mutants produce slow-to-extend, short pili, a phenotype that is rescued by mutations enhancing PilB ATP hydrolysis and/or re-introduction of FimX. Together, these data implicate FimX as a regulator of PilB enzymatic function, potentially enabling P. aeruginosa to fine-tune pilus extension dynamics in response to environmental cues.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

In aphids, dual-symbiotic systems involving the ancient obligate symbiont Buchnera aphidicola and a more recently acquired companion symbiont, such as Serratia symbiotica, have been well-documented in Lachninae and Chaitophorinae subfamilies. Recently, a novel Buchnera-Arsenophonus dual-symbiosis was discovered in Ceratovacuna japonica (Hormaphidinae). This study expands the knowledge of bacterial symbionts in the Hormaphidinae subfamily, particularly focusing on Ceratovacuna nekoashi and Pseudoregma panicola, to elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of dual-symbiosis within this lineage. Our 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis revealed that Cerataphidini species consistently harbor companion symbionts alongside Buchnera, whereas Hormaphidini and Nipponaphidini species harbor only Buchnera. Notably, Arsenophonus in C. nekoashi and C. japonica have distinct phylogenetic origins, and P. panicola has acquired Symbiopectobacterium instead of Arsenophonus. Microscopic analyses demonstrated that these companion symbionts are maternally transmitted and occupy distinct cell types from those harboring Buchnera. Genome sequencing revealed extreme reduction in Buchnera genomes to ~0.4 Mbp in both C. nekoashi and P. panicola, comparable to C. japonica but significantly smaller than Buchnera genomes of ~0.6 Mbp in mono-symbioses. The companion symbionts possess complete riboflavin biosynthesis pathways lost in Buchnera. Our findings suggest that Buchnera genome reduction and companion symbiont acquisition occurred in the common ancestor of Cerataphidini, followed by multiple companion symbiont replacements, revealing a dynamic evolutionary pattern of multi-partner symbioses.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

We show that the nCas9ERT2 fusion protein consisting of Cas9 and estrogen receptor flanked by two nuclear localization signals is normally located in the cytoplasm and efficiently translocated into the nucleus upon 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) treatment in cultured cells or embryos. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that target genes in primordial germ cells or germ cells of transgenic zebrafish embryos or adults with stable expression of nCas9ERT2 and gene-specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) can be induced to mutate by application of 4-OHT. This inducible nCas9ERT2 system also works in mouse early embryos. Thus, this inducible gene editing approach will be another choice for studying the temporospatial function of genes at the organismal level.

Many species combine calls into structured sequences, often following specific rules, yet most studies focus on only a few sequences per species. This limits our understanding of their ability to combine calls and convey meaning through sequences. Our study addresses this gap by documenting the vocal sequence repertoire and underlying rules of sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys), a West African monkey species. We collected and analysed 1,672 recordings from two wild groups in the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Sooty mangabeys frequently combine calls but rely on a limited set of sequences. Within these, we identified rules of call ordering, recurrence and hierarchical structuring. Notably, they produced hierarchically structured sequences using only two call types, a previously unreported system in animal communication. Our findings suggest that sooty mangabeys use both structured and unstructured sequences, likely encoding different types of information. While context of production remains essential for determining meaning, our results highlight how a whole-repertoire approach reveals the full range of rule-based sequences and their potential for meaning expansion beyond the number of individual calls available in the repertoire.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}

In this study we assess collagen prevalence within ART and OSA tonsils with the aim of better understanding the underlying disease pathophysiology. By performing label-free second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging of tonsil tissue from patients with ART and OSA it is possible to enable measurement of the relative abundance of immature and mature type I collagen within ex vivo paediatric palatine tonsils. We have demonstrated that there is a significant difference in the mean area fraction of immature type I collagen with a higher relative fraction in patients with ART compared to those with OSA (p = 0.0059). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean area fraction of mature type I collagen in patients with ART and OSA (p = 0.61).

This approach foregoes instantaneous protein identification and precludes real-time experimental control. Here, we introduce a method for the analysis of real-time nanopore data capable of characterizing the size and approximate shape of proteins within a millisecond response time during data acquisition. The implemented real-time Two-Sliding Window (TSW) peak detection algorithm makes it possible, for the first time, to filter data, process baselines, and extract resistive pulse information during nanopore recordings using a stream of single data points. This approach achieves a computational throughput of 40 MB/s on a 1.8 GHz laptop CPU. We compared the accuracy of dwell time determination of the TSW algorithm with an established offline threshold searching (TS) algorithm, using simulated resistive pulses. The TSW algorithm accurately extracted events with dwell times greater than 1.5 times the reciprocal of the system cutoff frequency, 1.5 * (fc)-1. Moreover, the TSW algorithm effectively determined the dwell time of resistive pulses with large intra-event modulation, which is crucial for resolving non-spherical protein-induced fluctuations. Finally, we verify experimentally that integrating the TSW algorithm into the data acquisition process makes it possible to determine the approximate shape and volume of proteins within low-millisecond response times.

Clinical observations demonstrate persistent progression of hyperglycaemia-induced multiorgan damage following blood glucose stabilization, which is predominantly mediated through epigenetic regulation. While prior studies have identified epigenetic contributions to hyperglycaemic myocardial injury, the involvement of RNA methylation-particularly N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification-in this regulatory network remains undefined. Methods: Clinical specimens were collected from diabetic patients, and cardiomyocyte-specific METTL1 and ob/ob knockout murine models were established in parallel. Multiomic profiling (proteomics, glycoproteomics, ubiquitinomics, m7G-MeRIP sequencing, and metabolomics) was systematically conducted. The molecular mechanisms governing METTL1 regulation via O-GlcNAcylation and ubiquitination were elucidated through integrated in vitro and in vivo assays. A DUB siRNA library and computational strategies combining molecular docking with molecular dynamics simulations were employed for screening drugs targeting METTL1 O-GlcNAcylation, followed by in vivo therapeutic validation. Results: Comparative analysis of diabetic murine and human samples revealed strong METTL1 downregulation in cardiomyopathy contexts. Tamoxifen-inducible METTL1 knockout mice presented exacerbated diabetic cardiomyopathy phenotypes, confirming its cardioprotective function. Multiomic integration demonstrated that METTL1-mediated m7G modification critically regulates cardiomyocyte fatty acid metabolism. Mechanistically, hyperglycaemia was found to induce O-GlcNAcylation at the METTL1-T268 residue, suppressing m7G methyltransferase activity by 38% (p < 0.01). Subsequent investigations revealed that USP5 deubiquitinase activity is impaired under hyperglycaemic conditions, leading to accelerated METTL1 degradation. Notably, administration of the first-in-class small drug HIT106265621 significantly attenuated cardiomyopathy-associated pathological alterations in ob/ob mice in vivo. Conclusion: Hyperglycaemia promotes METTL1 O-GlcNAcylation, which impedes USP5-mediated deubiquitination, consequently reducing cardiomyocyte METTL1 protein levels and m7G modification. METTL1 deficiency drives diabetic cardiomyopathy progression through fatty acid metabolic dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and myocardial hypertrophy.

The emergence of IVM resistance, driven by complex and poorly understood mechanisms, increasingly compromises treatment efficacy. Drug efflux transporters, particularly P-glycoproteins (PGPs), are suspected to contribute to resistance. Yet, the study of their individual and functional role is hindered by their diversity in nematodes. This study aimed to dissect the role of specific PGPs in mediating IVM resistance. Thus, Caenorhabditis elegans strain IVR10, selected for IVM resistance and reported to overexpress pgps, was used as a model. We generated different IVR10 strains each lacking one of six key pgps, and assessed changes in IVM tolerance. Remarkably, only the deletion of pgp-9 significantly increased IVM susceptibility. Furthermore, transgenic expression of Haemonchus contortus pgp-9.1 rescued the resistant phenotype, demonstrating a conserved function across species. To explore drug dynamics, we developed a fluorescent IVM analog, which revealed reduced drug accumulation in IVR10, a phenotype reversed by pgp-9 deletion. Altogether, these findings show that nematode PGP-9 modulates IVM tolerance by controlling drug efflux and highlight it as a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Signals in flux: Investigating the seasonal turnover of the diel vertical migration-inducing kairomone 5\u03b1-cyprinol sulfate", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.07.663427", "authors": "Ahlers, J.; von Elert, E.", "abstract": "5-cyprinol sulfate (CPS) is a chemical signal released by cyprinid fish that plays a crucial role in predator-prey interactions by inducing diel vertical migration (DVM) in Daphnia, a key process driving freshwater ecosystem dynamics. While CPS-mediated DVM has long been considered a stable and predictable response to predator abundance, this study challenges previous assumptions by demonstrating that CPS undergoes rapid turnover in aquatic systems. We show that CPS exudation is tightly linked to fish feeding intensity, independent of fish size, while microbial degradation emerges as the dominant removal process, with degradation rates reaching up to 85.7% per day in lake water. Seasonal field data from a mesotrophic lake reveal that CPS concentrations range from 40 to 900 ng/L over a season, peaking in late summer, putatively indicating increased fish feeding and shifts in prey availability. Using an integrated approach combining laboratory feeding trials, field sampling, and predictive modeling, we present a temperature-dependent framework that captures the interplay between CPS exudation and degradation. Our findings highlight a fundamental reconsideration of CPS as an environmental cue: rather than reflecting predator abundance, CPS concentrations primarily track predator feeding activity, dynamically modulating the strength of DVM and its cascading effects on freshwater food webs. This study provides the first in-situ quantification of CPS turnover, offering new insights into the temporal variability of chemical signaling and its ecosystem-wide consequences in fluctuating aquatic environments.", "date": "2025-07-10", "journal": ""}
