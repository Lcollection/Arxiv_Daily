R.", "abstract": "Ribosome profiling is a valuable methodology for measuring changes in a cell's translational program. The approach can report how efficiently mRNA coding sequences are translated and pinpoint positions along mRNAs where ribosomes slow down or arrest. It can also reveal when translation takes place outside coding regions, often with important regulatory consequences. While many useful software tools have emerged to facilitate analysis of these data, packages can become complex and challenging to adapt to specialized needs. We therefore introduce ribofootPrinter, a suite of Python tools designed to offer an accessible and modifiable set of code for analysis of data from ribosome profiling and related types of small RNA sequencing experiments. Alignments are made to a simplified transcriptome to keep the code intuitive and multiple normalization options help facilitate interpretation of meta analysis, particularly outside coding regions. We demonstrate how mapping of short reads to the transcriptome increases the frequency of matches to multiple sites and we provide multimapper identifier files to highlight these regions. Overall, this tool has the capability to carry out sophisticated analysis while maintaining enough simplicity to make it readily understandable and adaptable.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Janzen-Connell effects and habitat-induced aggregation synergistically promote species coexistence", "doi": "10.1101/2022.04.11.487940", "authors": "Smith, D. J. B.", "abstract": "(1) Janzen-Connell (JC) effects and habitat partitioning (HP) are two leading hypotheses for the maintenance of tropical forest diversity. There is strong empirical evidence that both mechanisms operate in forest communities, but the consequences of their joint operation remain poorly understood. (2) I develop a spatially explicit model that incorporates JC-effects, HP, and dispersal limitation. The model tracks propagules subject to habitat filtering and conspecific density dependence, and quantifies equilibrium species richness across a wide range of conditions. (3) JC-effects and HP each stabilize coexistence individually but fail to maintain high richness under biologically feasible parameter values. When both mechanisms operate together, the outcome depends on habitat spatial structure: if habitats are not spatially autocorrelated, their joint operation yields little more diversity than either mechanism alone, and sometimes less. In contrast, when habitats are positively autocorrelated, the two mechanisms interact synergistically and promote high species richness. This occurs because habitat specialization clusters conspecifics in favorable environments, concentrating JC-effects where species perform best. This interaction is quantified by the spatial JC-HP covariance, a simple and empirically measurable metric. (4) The relationship between species aggregation and richness qualitatively differs depending on the mechanism generating aggregation. Aggregation driven by dispersal limitation decreases the ability of JC-effects to maintain coexistence. By contrast, when JC-effects and HP operate together in spatially autocorrelated habitats, richness increased with conspecific aggregation. (5) Synthesis. The interaction between JC-effects and habitat specialization can maintain high species richness -- potentially on par with levels observed in tropical forests -- when neither mechanism alone nor the sum of their parts does so. Habitat autocorrelation concentrates density dependence in species' favorable environments, generating a positive relationship between aggregation and species richness. This overturns the common expectation that strong JC-effects should produce overdispersion and instead shows that JC-mediated coexistence can be positively associated with intraspecific aggregation. By identifying the JC-HP covariance as the key measure of this interaction, results provide a framework for linking trees' spatial patterns to abiotically and biotically driven spatially-dependent processes that sustain forest diversity.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

We have investigated P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm infection over 7 d in an ex vivo pig lung (EVPL) model for CF, previously shown to facilitate formation of a clinically relevant P. aeruginosa biofilm structure with expression of key genes comparable to human infection. We have compared P. aeruginosa gene expression between sequential time points: 24 h, 48 h and 7 d post infection, and investigated tolerance to polymyxins. Our results demonstrate that the EVPL model can maintain a P. aeruginosa biofilm population, which exhibits increased antibiotic tolerance, for at least 7 d. Differential expression of antimicrobial resistance-associated genes was not observed, however there was significant upregulation of sulfur metabolism and maintenance of a structured biofilm.

In contrast, some natural communities hint at the possibility that the presence of toxin genes and externally supplied antibiotics may support higher diversity. We address this gap with a model that shows how toxins in small and medium-sized communities can indeed promote diversity. The central idea of the model emerges from the combination of bacterial growth laws of resource partitioning and recent experiments suggesting a trade-off between toxin sensitivity and nutrient efficiency. The second puzzle in natural data is the presence of both negative and positive regulation of toxin production under similar environmental stress. Our model shows how this diversity in regulation of toxin production can promote toxin-producer fitness. In general, we provide a framework to integrate the role of toxins in microbial communities.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

D.; Berggren, P.; Dulvy, N. K.", "abstract": "The maximum intrinsic population growth rate, rmax, is a key determinant of the limits for sustainable fishing and is increasingly used in risk assessments. Metabolic theory suggests that rmax scales with adult body size, temperature (and hence depth) such that smaller-bodied species and those in warmer, shallower waters have greater rmax and, therefore, will be less sensitive to overexploitation. However, warm shallow-water tropical rays have lower rmax than cold deep-water temperate skates contra to the metabolic expectation. To resolve this paradox, we build from recent advances that suggest that offspring size may be key to understanding rmax. Specifically, we examine how rmax is related to adult size, offspring size, temperature, and depth across 85 ray and skate species. Our results show that offspring size mediates relationships between rmax, adult body size, temperature, and depth. Indeed, tropical rays had, on average, larger offspring and lower rmax compared to the temperate skates, despite living in warmer, shallower waters. Thus, despite the expectation from theory that tropical species should have faster life histories compared to temperate species, our result explains why tropical rays are actually less resilient. It remains unclear as to why tropical rays have such large offspring but we speculate that this is due to greater predation risk in shallow tropical waters driving the additional maternal investment in offspring size via the evolution of viviparity and matrotrophy. Our work highlights the complex relationships among life histories and the environment and may help explain global biogeographic patterns of intrinsic sensitivity to overexploitation.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Surprisingly, bioinformatics analysis demonstrates that cisplatin targets the majority of human protein kinase and phosphatase genes and involved in 300 core signalling pathways (-log p >4). The most associated key signalling pathways are sperm motility and protein kinase A. The highest related disease is cancer, and tissue toxicities related to CDGs are about hepato- and nephro- toxicities. Notably, cisplatin damaged 85% (440) of human protein kinase genes and 81% (110) of human protein phosphatase genes.

In this study, we report a distinct mechanism whereby IFN expression is negatively regulated in fish by CDK2. After infection with the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), fish CDK2 expression significantly increased in tissues and cells. Moreover, antiviral resistance was improved in cdk2-/- homozygotes, and the antiviral cytokine interferon (IFN) expression was significantly higher. At the cellular level, CDK2 overexpression reduced IFN expression, while cdk2 knockdown increased the ability of cells to produce IFN. Subsequently, it was discovered that fish CDK2 binds and degrades TBK1, resulting in reduced IFN. CDK2 increases the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, causing its degradation, while E3 ubiquitin ligase Dtx4 was found to be involved in this process following the significant enhancement of TBK1 K48-linked ubiquitination. Protein mass spectrometry and immunoblot analysis confirmed that the K567 site on TBK1 is essential for CDK2 to engage with Dtx4 and degrade TBK1; thus, after mutating the K567 site, K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 was not enhanced by Dtx4, and TBK1 was not degraded by CDK2. Our data demonstrate that fish CDK2 recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Dtx4 to target the K567 site of TBK1 and promote its degradation. These results suggest that CDK2 in lower vertebrates is implicated in a specialized role for antiviral innate immunity.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a previously unrecognized role of oligodendrocytes in orchestrating synchronized spontaneous activity during a critical developmental window, with lasting consequences for adult behavior. Using oligodendrocyte-specific genetic manipulation in the mouse cerebellum, we demonstrate that oligodendrocyte deficiency during early postnatal development, but not after weaning, disrupts the synchronization of Purkinje cell activity both during development and in adulthood. The early disruption produced persistent deficits in cerebellar-dependent behaviors, including anxiety, sociality, and motor function. Optogenetic re-synchronization in adulthood restored motor and social functions but not anxiety-like behavior, demonstrating that reduced Purkinje cell synchrony specifically drives the motor and social impairments. Our findings establish a causal link between developmental oligodendrocyte-regulated neural synchrony and the emergence of complex brain functions, which depend on the proper developmental trajectory necessary for driving brain function.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

The incomplete understanding of the molecular disease mechanisms results in lacking treatment options, leading to high mortality amongst patients. Here, using an inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific lamin A/C depletion mouse model, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic study, combining both bulk and single nucleus RNA sequencing, and spanning LMNA-DCM disease progression, to identify potential disease drivers. Our refined analysis pipeline identified 496 genes already misregulated early in disease. The expression of these genes was largely driven by disease specific cardiomyocyte sub-populations and involved biological processes mediating cellular response to DNA damage, cytosolic pattern recognition, and innate immunity. Indeed, DNA damage in LMNA-DCM hearts was significantly increased early in disease and correlated with reduced cardiomyocyte lamin A levels. Activation of cytosolic pattern recognition in cardiomyocytes was independent of cGAS, which is rarely expressed in cardiomyocytes, but likely occurred downstream of other pattern recognition sensors such as IFI16. Altered gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts and immune cell infiltration further contributed to tissue-wide changes in gene expression. Our transcriptomic analysis further predicted significant alterations in cell-cell communication between cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and immune cells, mediated through early changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the LMNA-DCM hearts. Taken together, our work suggests a model in which nuclear damage in cardiomyocytes leads to activation of DNA damage responses, cytosolic pattern recognition pathway, and other signaling pathways that activate inflammation, immune cell recruitment, and transcriptional changes in cardiac fibroblasts, which collectively drive LMNA-DCM pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

It is characterized by glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) composed of fibrillar alpha-synuclein (aSyn), whose formation shows parallels with prion propagation. While fibrils extracted from MSA brains have been structurally characterized, their ability to replicate in a protein-only manner has been questioned, and their capacity to induce GCIs in vivo remains unexplored. By contrast, the synthetic fibril strain 1B, assembled from recombinant human aSyn, self-replicates in vitro and induces GCIs in mice - suggesting direct relevance to MSA - but awaited scrutiny at an atomic scale. Here, we report high-resolution structural analyses of 1B fibrils and of fibrils extracted from diseased mice injected with 1B that developed GCIs (1BP). We show in vivo that conformational templating enables fibril strain replication, resulting in MSA-like inclusion pathology. Remarkably, the structures of 1B and 1BP are highly similar and mimic the fold of aSyn observed in one protofilament of fibrils isolated from MSA patients. Moreover, reinjection of crude mouse brain homogenates containing 1BP into new mice reproduces the same MSA-like pathology induced by the parent synthetic seed 1B.

Here we investigated the function of FGF in a stem cell model for human gastrulation known as a 2D gastruloid. We found a ring of FGF-dependent ERK activity that closely follows the emergence of primitive streak (PS)-like cells but expands further inward. We showed that this ERK activity pattern is required for PS-like differentiation and that loss of PS-like cells upon FGF receptor inhibition can be rescued by directly activating ERK. We further demonstrated that the ERK-ring depends on localized activation of basolaterally positioned FGF receptors (FGFR) by endogenous FGF gradients. We confirmed and extended previous studies in analyzing expression of FGF pathway components, showing FGFR1 is the main receptor, FGF2 is highly expressed across several cell types, and FGF4/17 are the main FGF ligands expressed in the PS-like cells, similar to the human and monkey embryo but different from the mouse. We found that knockdown of FGF4 greatly reduced PS-like differentiation while FGF17 knockdown primarily affected subsequent mesoderm differentiation. FGF8 expression was spatially displaced from PS-markers and FGF4 expression and peaked earlier, while knockdown led to an expansion in PS-like cells, suggesting FGF8 may counteract FGF4 to limit PS-like differentiation. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown role for FGF-dependent ERK signaling in 2D gastruloids and possibly the human embryo, driven by a mechanism where FGF4 and FGF17 signal through basally localized FGFR1 to induce PS-like cells and their derivatives, potentially restricted by FGF8.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

However, PRC2 binds a wide variety of RNA sequences, and it remains unclear how diverse RNAs beyond G4 associate with and regulate PRC2. Here, we show that variations in RNA sequence elicit distinct effects on PRC2 function. A single-stranded G-rich RNA and an atypical G4 structure called a pUG-fold mediate PRC2 dimerization nearly identical to that induced by G4 RNA. In contrast, pyrimidine-rich RNAs, including a motif identified by CLIPseq in cells, do not induce PRC2 dimerization and instead bind PRC2 monomers with retention of methyltransferase activity. Only RNAs that dimerize PRC2 compete with nucleosome binding and inhibit PRC2 methyltransferase activity. CRISPR-dCas9 was adapted to localize different RNA elements onto a PRC2-targeted gene, revealing RNA sequence specificity for PRC2 regulation in cells.

Using live light sheet fluorescence microscopy, we discovered that individual fat body cells express antimicrobial peptides at approximately constant rates following infection, but that the average rate varies along the anterior-posterior axis of the fat body, with rapid expression in the anterior and posterior lobes. Overexpression of immune signaling components and analysis of spatial transcriptomes revealed that these tissue microenvironments are predefined independently of infection, with the rate-limiting step of antimicrobial peptide induction downstream of peptidoglycan sensing.

We find that both sexes show shorter dispersal distances than expected under random mating. While female-biased natal dispersal mitigates inbreeding risk to some extent, limited movement away from the breeding territory by both sexes for later pairings (following mate death or divorce) results in higher relatedness between mates than expected under random mating. Males paired with close relatives and females who move longer distances experience equivalently reduced lifetime reproductive success (LRS). Moreover, breeders who move farther for first pairings experience reduced survival likelihood and consequently reduced LRS.

The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotes polarization of CD4 T cell populations away from immune tolerance, induces differentiation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells, and drives expansion and anti-tumor activity in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies. This work aims to test whether IL-6 could stimulate an anti-tumor response in PDAC. Methods: We overexpressed IL-6 in multiple KrasG12D/+, Tp53R172H/+, Pdx1-Cre (KPC) cell lines, which were orthotopically implanted in mice (OT-PDACIL6). We followed mouse survival and measured tumor growth, tumor histology, and plasma IL-6 at 5 and 10 days after tumor implantation. We measured tumor immune cell infiltration via flow cytometry and histology. We used antibody-based T cell depletion and secondary tumor implantation rechallenge to test the dependency of the durable immune reaction on T cells. Results: Improved survival occurred in all instances of OT-PDACIL6, with one cell line (KxPxCx) reproducibly resulting in long-term recurrence-free survival. With KxPxCx cells, circulating IL-6 was 100-fold higher in OT-PDACIL6 than in OT-PDACparental mice. Flow cytometry revealed increased T cells and NK cells, and decreased T regulatory cells, and we observed significantly increased lymphoid aggregates in OT-PDACIL6 as compared to OT-PDACparental tumors.

N.", "abstract": "Mitochondria lack nucleotide excision repair; however, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is resistant to mutation accumulation following DNA damage. These observations suggest additional damage sensing or protection mechanisms. Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial (TFAM) compacts mtDNA into nucleoids and binds differentially to certain forms of DNA damage. As such, TFAM has emerged as a candidate for protecting mtDNA or sensing damage. To examine the possibilities that TFAM might protect DNA from damage or act as a damage sensing protein for irreparable forms of mtDNA damage, we used live-cell imaging, cell-based assays, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high-throughput protein-DNA binding assays to characterize the binding properties of TFAM to ultraviolet-C (UVC) irradiated DNA and the cellular consequences of UVC irradiation. Our cell data show increased TFAM mRNA after exposure and suggest an increase in mtDNA degradation and turnover without a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential that might trigger mitophagy. Our protein-DNA binding assays indicate a reduction in sequence specificity of TFAM following UVC irradiation and a redistribution of TFAM binding throughout the mitochondrial genome. Our AFM data show increased compaction of DNA by TFAM in the presence of damage. Despite the TFAM-mediated compaction of mtDNA, we do not observe any protective effect of increased compaction on DNA damage formation in cells or in vitro. Taken together, these studies indicate that UVC-induced DNA damage alters TFAM binding and promotes compaction by TFAM, suggesting that TFAM may act as a damage sensing protein, sequestering damaged genomes to prevent mutagenesis by facilitating removal or suppression of replication.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

We present the implementation and efficacy of an open-source closed-loop neurofeedback (CLNF) and closed-loop movement feedback (CLMF) system. In CLNF, we measure mm-scale cortical mesoscale activity with GCaMP6s and provide graded auditory feedback (within ~63 ms) based on changes in dorsal-cortical activation within regions of interest (ROI) and with a specified rule. Single or dual ROIs (ROI1, ROI2) on the dorsal cortical map were selected as targets. Both motor and sensory regions supported closed-loop training in male and female mice. Mice modulated activity in rule-specific target cortical ROIs to get increasing rewards over days (RM ANOVA p=2.83e-5) and adapted to changes in ROI rules (RM ANOVA p=8.3e-10, Table 4 for different rule changes). In CLMF, feedback (within ~67 ms) was based on tracking a specified body movement, and rewards were generated when the behavior reached a threshold. For movement training, the group that received graded auditory feedback performed significantly better (RM-ANOVA p=9.6e-7) than a control group (RM-ANOVA p=0.49) within four training days. Additionally, mice can learn a change in task rule from left forelimb to right forelimb within a day, after a brief performance drop on day 5. Offline analysis of neural data and behavioral tracking revealed changes in the overall distribution of Ca2+ fluorescence values in CLNF and body-part speed values in CLMF experiments. Increased CLMF performance was accompanied by a decrease in task latency and cortical {Delta}F/F0 amplitude during the task, indicating lower cortical activation as the task gets more familiar.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Yet, how novel neoantigens emerge in humans remains incompletely understood. Here, we designed an immunopeptidomics-based approach to probe HLA-II-bound, islet-derived neoepitopes in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We uncovered a microenvironment-driven cysteine-to-serine transformation, conserved between mice and humans, that reshapes autoreactivity to insulin, the core {beta}-cell antigen, at the single-residue level. This transformation, which we call 'C19S,' arises from oxidative remodeling of insulin in stressed pancreatic islets and can also occur in inflammatory antigen-presenting cells, contributing to a feed-forward loop of neoepitope formation and presentation as diabetes progresses. Despite involving only a single amino acid, C19S is specifically recognized by HLA-DQ8-restricted, register-specific CD4+ T cells that expand in individuals with T1D. These C19S-specific CD4+ T cells lack regulatory potential but acquire a poised central memory phenotype that persists at different disease stages.

We investigated how BR-bodies significantly influence mRNA fate by transitioning between liquid- and solid-like states in response to stress. With a combination of single-molecule and bulk fluorescence microscopy, biochemical assays, and quantitative analyses, we determine that BR-bodies promote efficient mRNA decay in a liquid-like condensate during exponential growth. On the other hand, BR-bodies are repurposed from sites of mRNA decay to reservoirs for mRNA storage under stress; a functional change that is enabled by their transition to a more rigid state, marked by reduced internal dynamics, increased molecular density, and prolonged residence time of ribonuclease E. Furthermore, we manipulated ATP levels and translation rates, and we conclude that the accumulation of ribosome-depleted mRNA is a key factor driving BR-body rigification, and that condensate maturation further contributes to this process. Upon nutrient replenishment, stationary-phase BR-bodies disassemble, releasing stored mRNAs for rapid translation, demonstrating that BR-body function is governed by a reversible mechanism for resource management.

How surviving ookinetes interact with midgut cells and form oocysts is poorly known, yet these steps are essential to initiate a remarkable growth process culminating in the production of thousands of infectious sporozoites2. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of both parasites and mosquito cells across different developmental stages and metabolic conditions, we unveil key transitions and mosquito-parasite interactions occurring in the midgut. Functional analyses uncover processes regulating oocyst growth and identify the transcription factor PfSIP2 as essential for sporozoite infection of human hepatocytes. Combining shared mosquito-parasite barcode analysis with confocal microscopy, we reveal that parasites preferentially interact with midgut progenitor cells during epithelial crossing, potentially using their basal location as an exit landmark. Additionally, we show tight connections between extracellular late oocysts and surrounding muscle cells that may ensure parasites adherence to the midgut.

However, we show that extracellular adenosine deamination catalyzed by adenosine deaminase related growth factor (ADGF), is a major source of ammonia, and demonstrate a direct role of ammonia in tip organizer development. The tip formed during early development in Dictyostelium functions analogously to the embryonic organizer of higher vertebrates. Dictyostelium cell lines carrying mutations in the gene adgf fail to establish an organizer, and this could be reversed by exposing the mutants to volatile ammonia. Interestingly, Klebsiella pneumoniae physically separated from the Dictyostelium adgf mutants in a partitioned dish, also rescues the mound arrest phenotype suggesting a cross-kingdom interaction that drives development. Both the substrate, adenosine and the product, ammonia regulate adgf expression, and ADGF acts downstream of the histidine kinase DhkD in regulating tip formation. Thus, the consecutive transformation of extracellular cAMP to adenosine, and adenosine to ammonia are integral steps during Dictyostelium development. Remarkably, in higher vertebrates, adgf expression is elevated during gastrulation and thus adenosine deamination may be a conserved process driving organizer development in different organisms.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Cryptic RNA-ligand binding sites can be promising targets due to high specificity in RNA-ligand interaction and Structure Based Drug Design (SBDD) for RNA is a practical approach to achieve successful drug candidates. However, SBDD for RNA faces a technical challenge, a paucity of available tertiary structures of RNA-ligand complexes. We addressed this problem by theoretically generating RNA conformations with cryptic binding sites from apo RNA conformations. Recalling that molecular dynamic simulation studies have not resulted in RNA conformations with the cryptic binding site, even for the paradigmatic RNA-ligand complex, HIV-1 Transactivation Response Element (TAR) binding to MV-2003, we leveraged sampling performance of apo RNA conformations by using a generative deep learning model (DL), Molearn.

We succeeded to generate TAR conformations with a cryptic binding cavity for MV-2003, without a priori knowledge of the cavity. These conformations were docked to MV2003, yielding poses with binding scores comparable to those calculated for experimentally resolved TAR-MV2003 complexes.

Most methods detect traveling waves by measuring spatial phase gradients, i.e., monotonic and ordered phase changes through space.

We demonstrate that the phase ordering in traveling waves does not always correspond to the direction of effective information flow. We show that discrepancies can emerge in the case of systems with delays and inhibitory influences. As a methodological solution, we show that Granger causality analysis can, in linear systems, recover the directionality of the information flow. We propose a new measure called DIFF, the Directional Information Flow Field. DIFF is constructed by analyzing directed causal influences in space and time between neighbours, yielding a vector field. As a proof of principle, we show that, in a 2D field where a connected network is perturbed by an external input, the Divergence of DIFF can identify the spatial source of the perturbations.

The reasons underlying these changes in parasite virulence are manifold. Here, we investigated the importance of order and timing of infection. We used a model of rodent coinfection between two parasites that do not compete for common resources, an intestinal nematode (Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Hp) and an apicomplexan protozoan (Plasmodium yoelii, Py). During single infections, Hp induced only mild disease symptoms. Plasmodium produced a substantial reduction in the number of red blood cells but all mice recovered from the infection. A different picture emerged in coinfected hosts. Hp maintained a profile of mostly asymptomatic infection when infecting hosts that had been previously infected with Py. On the contrary, Py incurred substantially higher costs in hosts that had been previously infected with Hp. We then investigated the possible reasons underlying the increase of Py virulence in hosts that had been previously infected with Hp. We found that coinfected hosts were less able to control Py multiplication and to recover from infection-induced anemia. Coinfected hosts had similar levels of erythropoietin and similar renewal of lost red blood cells compared to single Py infected hosts, resulting in decreased tolerance to Py infection. Experimental administration of erythropoietin in coinfected (Hp infecting first) hosts, partially decreased the severity of disease symptoms and improved tolerance. The detoxification of free heme released during the lysis of red blood cells, and the expression of Th1 and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes were also similar between coinfected and single infected hosts. However, coinfected mice had higher proportions of regulatory T cells expressing the CTLA-4 immune checkpoint, suggesting an enhanced immunosuppressive activity of Tregs. Py infection also induced the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, as coinfected mice had higher proportions of both PD-1+ and LAG-3+ CD8+ T cells, and an increase in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Overall, these results stress the importance of the order of infection as a major determinant of malaria severity in hosts harboring a gastrointestinal nematode infection.

The flexible framework can also use external information, such as parasite density and performance characteristics of a geno-typing panel. Using simulations, we show that Aster dramatically outperforms match-counting algorithms in a wide variety of transmission settings and demonstrates consistently balanced performance that improves with more informative genotyping panels.

Modern genotyping methods such as multiplexed amplicon sequencing hold great potential for resolving recurrences and motivate the need for corresponding statistical methods able to utilize the rich data they provide. We propose an Adaptive Statistical framework for Therapeutic Efficacy and Recrudescence (Aster) that delivers accurate and consistent results by explicitly incorporating complexity of infection (COI), population allele frequencies, and imperfect detection of alleles in minority strains. Using an identity by descent approach, Aster accounts for alleles matching by chance and for a background infection relatedness structure that can otherwise lead to misclassification. The flexible framework can also use external information, such as parasite density and performance characteristics of a geno-typing panel. Using simulations, we show that Aster dramatically outperforms match-counting algorithms in a wide variety of transmission settings and demonstrates consistently balanced performance that improves with more informative genotyping panels. Aster is implemented in a fast, fully scalable, and user-friendly R software package asterTES and provides accurate estimates of treatment failure for TES with any type of genotyping data, facilitating reliable evaluation of drug efficacy and effective management of malaria.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

V.; Puiu, D.; Pertea, M.; Yorke, J.; Salzberg, S.", "abstract": "For many years, machine learning-based ab initio gene finding approaches have been central components of eukaryotic genome annotation pipelines, and they remain so today. The reliance on these approaches was originally sustained by the high cost and low availability of gene expression data, a primary source of evidence for gene annotation along with protein homology. However, innovations in modern sequencing technologies have revolutionized the acquisition of gene expression data, allowing scientists to rely more heavily on this class of evidence. In addition, proteins found in a multitude of well-annotated genomes represent another invaluable resource for gene annotation. Existing annotation packages often underutilize these data sources, which prompted us to develop EviAnn (Evidence-based Annotator), a novel evidence-based eukaryotic gene annotation system. EviAnn takes a strongly data-driven approach, building the exon-intron structure of genes from transcript alignments or protein-sequence homology rather than from purely ab initio gene finding techniques. We show that when provided with the same input data, EviAnn consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art packages including BRAKER3, MAKER2, and FINDER, while utilizing considerably less computer time. Annotation of a mammalian genome can be completed in less than an hour on a single multi-core server.

This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis, in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis in a cAMP-independent manner and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acid as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a C. albicans mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase (Pfk1) exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Overall, our work elucidates a previously uncharacterized coupling between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism that is critical for driving fungal morphogenesis, contributing to our understanding of this conserved phenomenon.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

We previously identified that a naturally occurring mutation in MAFA (MAFAS64F) predisposes carriers to divergent conditions of either maturity (adult)-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or hypoglycemia in a sex-dependent manner, and we modeled these phenotypes in mice expressing this MafA variant. Here we show that the genetic background in mice can modulate penetrance of the male glycemic phenotype: heterozygous MafAS64F/+ males backcrossed on a C57/Bl6J (C57) background prevents this pathology with improved insulin secretion, while MafAS64F/+ males on a mixed background (C57 with SJL) manifest overt diabetes and impaired insulin secretion by 5 weeks of age due (in part) to accelerated {beta}-cell senescence. In contrast, female mice on either background (mixed or backcrossed C57) similarly show hypoglycemia. Bulk RNAseq on male C57/Bl6J islets revealed fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and a more similar profile to MafAWT males than MafAS64F/+ males on the mixed background, including abrogation of {beta}-cell senescence and intact expression of circadian regulators. CUT&RUN mapping revealed that MafA likely regulates several of the DEGs identified in both C57 and mixed genetic backgrounds. Our analysis also identified increased expression of many islet-enriched transcription factors directly regulating MafA expression (e.g., Pdx1) and increased MafA protein levels in C57 MafAS64F/+ males. In sum, these data suggest that the penetrance of diabetes caused MAFAS64F activity in male human islet {beta}-cells may be modulated by genetic background to impact {beta}-cell senescence, circadian regulation, and islet function", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

This factor, which has rarely been accounted for in diffusion MRI (dMRI) modeling, is modeled in this work, allowing for the estimation of the gradient of the relaxation-time properties from the dMRI signal. Methods: With the aim of mining the dMRI signal for information about the spatial variations in the tissue relaxation-time properties, a new mathematical relationship between the diffusion signal and the spatial gradient of the image is derived, which enables the estimation of the latter from the former. The hypothesis was validated on human brain dMRI images from three datasets: the public Human Connectome Project Young Adults database, 10 healthy volunteers and 1 ex vivo sample scanned in-house with stimulated-echo diffusion encoding and a long diffusion time of 1 second (which will be made publicly available), and 3 subjects from the public Multi-TE database. The effects of the confounding factor of \"fiber continuity\" were furthermore measured. Results: The image spatial gradient estimated from the diffusion signal was compared to the gold-standard spatial gradient approximated through the finite difference. The former gradient was significantly related to the latter in all datasets (i.e., with a difference significantly smaller than chance), with an effect distinct from fiber continuity. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesized relationship between within-voxel dMRI signal and image gradient, with an effect that was not explainable by the confounding factor of fiber continuity.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Urbanization has the potential to affect floral trait evolution by altering pollinator communities through environmental changes. Additionally, abiotic changes in urban habitats can induce phenotypic plasticity, further shaping evolutionary trajectories. We investigated how urbanization affects the genetic and plastic components of flower morphology of Impatiens capensis across four Canadian cities. We found that urbanization influenced the pollinator community composition and the body size of bumblebees, the species main pollinator, although the magnitude of the size effect varied among cities. Using a combination of field surveys and a common garden experiment, our results suggest that urbanization affects sepal size, a tubular floral organ in which pollinators enter to access the nectar, through both genetic and plastic responses. While plasticity sometimes masked the genetic determination of sepal size in the field, we observed a positive correlation between the genetic component of the sepal size and bumblebee body size. These results suggest that urban habitats may drive evolutionary changes in floral traits by modifying pollinator communities.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Understanding the trajectory of such a genome has largely been done through study of animal-associated bacteria, especially insect endosymbionts. Yet, endofungal bacteria provide another natural experimental model for investigating how microbial genomes change when living inside of a host cell. Mycetohabitans spp. are culturable bacterial endosymbionts of the Mucoromycota fungus Rhizopus microsporus. To investigate the genome dynamics resulting from the endohyphal nature of this emerging model genus, we long-read sequenced and assembled new complete genomes to combine with previous assemblies, creating a global dataset of 28 complete Mycetohabitans genomes. All genomes were between 3.3 and 3.9 Mbp in size and were multipartite, structured into two conserved replicons with some strains having an additional plasmid. Based on evolutionary rate and gene content analysis of the different replicons, we termed the two major ones a chromosome and chromid. The differential presence of a third, mobilome-rich plasmid in some strains and the proliferation of transposable elements provide putative mechanisms for recombination or gene loss. The conservation of intact prophage and putative toxin-antitoxin systems, and extensive enrichment of secondary metabolite clusters in the Mycetohabitans genomes highlight the dynamic nature of this reducing genome.

These P450s were co-expressed with various NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases (CPRs), and activity was assayed directly using unpurified reactions. P450s 3A4 and 2D6 showed distinct preferences in reductase coupling: P450 3A4 activity was greatest when coupled to the human CPR, whereas P450 2D6 performed better when co-expressed with CPRs from Arabidopsis thaliana. Inhibition assays with chloramphenicol, terbinafine, and erythromycin yielded results consistent with known P450-drug interactions.

A novel non-antibiotic minocycline derivative, 10-butyl ether minocycline (BEM), was synthesized to retain the pleiotropy of minocycline while minimizing side effects such as antibiotic resistance and gut dysbiosis. Previously, we showed that BEM reduced alcohol consumption in dependent murine and porcine models of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of BEM to determine its potential as a therapeutic agent for neuroimmune and inflammatory conditions such as AUD. Here, we report that BEM showed a nearly complete loss of antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. typhi, and C. albicans. BEM showed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability as measured by the MTT assay, similarly to MINO. BEM also suppressed LPS-induced microglial activation as shown by reduced Iba1 expression in immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. Inhibition of MMP-9 by BEM (IC50 = 42.2 {micro}M) was improved compared to MINO (IC50 = 60.3 {micro}M) while MMP-8 inhibition was moderate (IC50: BEM = 69.4 {micro}M ; MINO = 45.4 {micro}M). BEM was found to be effective in inhibiting VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and L-glutamine-induced ROS levels. Limited inhibition of 15-LOX activity was observed (IC50: BEM = 92.6 {micro}M ; MINO = 65.6 {micro}M). BEM was not toxic to mitochondria, even at high concentrations (200 {micro}M). By eliminating antimicrobial properties while preserving therapeutic pleiotropy, BEM presents an advancement in the development of a promising candidate with multimodal mechanisms to treat neuroimmune-inflammatory pathologies.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. CRC tumors exhibit aberrant iron accumulation, which supports tumor cell proliferation through multiple metabolic pathways. However, the oncogenic benefits of elevated iron must be counterbalanced by its potential to catalyze oxidative damage via reactive oxygen species generated from labile, redox-active iron. Ferroptosis is a regulated, non-apoptotic form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This process is tightly controlled by the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which reduces lipid peroxides and can be pharmacologically inhibited by agents such as RSL3 and JKE1674. A key source of redox-active iron is the labile iron pool (LIP), yet its role in regulating ferroptosis remains incompletely defined. To examine this, we supplemented CRC cells with exogenous iron following pharmacologic induction of ferroptosis. Iron supplementation significantly reduced cell viability, suggesting that expansion of the LIP potentiates ferroptotic cell death. However, whether ferroptosis is accompanied by dynamic changes in the LIP, and if such changes are mechanistically required for its potentiation, were unknown. To further characterize this response, we profiled the expression of iron regulatory genes under ferroptotic conditions and observed no change in transcriptional response in iron homeostasis genes. Using a reactivity-based probe of labile iron, we found that the LIP did not measurably increase during ferroptosis induction with GPX4 inhibition or inhibition of the SLC7A11 cysteine/glutamate antiporter. These findings suggest that the LIP does not expand upon pharmacological initiated ferroptosis, despite the potentiating effect of exogenous iron supplementation.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Here we used state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations and experiments to test a hypothesis that fentanyl's extreme potency is driven by its ability to partition into the plasma membrane, creating a drug reservoir near the receptor. The estimated effective permeability of fentanyl at pH 7.5 is on the order of 10e-7 cm/s -- at least two orders of magnitude faster than morphine. In contrast, isotonitazene (a newly emerged UPS opioid) and naloxone (an antagonist) effectively do not partition into the membrane under the same conditions. The simulations captured the proton-coupled permeation processes, challenging the long-standing pH-partition hypothesis. Subsequent reporter cell line experiments demonstrated that cells exposed to fentanyl, but not morphine, reactivated the receptor even after washout and addition of naloxone. Immobilized affinity membrane chromatography confirmed that fentanyl has significantly higher phospholipid affinity than morphine. Our findings strongly support the drug depot hypothesis and highlight the importance of membrane-dependent opioid pharmacology for understanding toxicity and guiding the design of more effective antagonists.

To investigate how circuits retain stable wiring and function throughout development, we combined synaptic-level resolution electron microscopy (EM) with computational modeling in the Drosophila larval nociceptive system. Based on EM data, we generated the contactome-the set of synaptic membrane contacts-of this circuit across development to evaluate how different mechanisms contribute to wiring stability. Specifically, we investigated three mechanisms: correlation-based plasticity and synaptic scaling, which modify synaptic strength, and structural plasticity, which preserves synaptic density. We found that synaptic sizes remain largely stable across development, and synapses between the same pre- and postsynaptic neurons do not correlate in size, suggesting that synaptic scaling and correlation-based plasticity play a limited role in shaping connectivity. In contrast, dendritic synaptic density remains invariant despite a previously reported fivefold increase in neuron size and synapse number. This conservation requires increased axonal presynaptic density to compensate for unequal axonal and dendritic growth. As neurons grow, this adjustment is necessary to maintain the relative synaptic input associated with each presynaptic partner across development. Our EM analysis and modeling show that conserving relative connectivity and synaptic density is sufficient to maintain consistent postsynaptic responses across development, highlighting these conserved structural features as key contributors to circuit stability during growth.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Using a factorial design, we combined untargeted LC MS metabolomics with morpho-physiological measurements to evaluate these memory effects. We found that each type of memory changed plant metabolism and physiology, but the most notable changes occurred when both memories were present, and plants faced recurrent drought conditions again. This interaction between drought memory, MeJA memory, and current stress did not just add effects, it created entirely new metabolic responses, not seen in any single treatment. These combined memories fine tuned water conservation, photosynthesis, and extensive metabolomic reshuffling, revealing a deeper level of drought resilience.

We present MultiSEED, a fast numerical framework that captures strain dynamics across ecological and evolutionary timescales. Unlike previous models, MultiSEED distinguishes between transient and established strains, allowing classification of diseases into regimes of extinction, replacement, or coexistence. When applied to influenza A, HIV-1, pneumococcus, and malaria, the model reproduces observed strain diversity and turnover while revealing the key drivers of these differences. We show that susceptible host replenishment is central to long-term strain persistence, host population size and R0 shape overall diversity, and innovation rates strongly influence dynamic regimes, with their combined interactions ultimately determining pathogen strain diversity and turnover. This unifying framework can be readily applied across systems, enabling the rapid prediction of pathogen responses to environmental and demographic changes and guiding strategies for disease control.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The Drosophila corneal lens is an apical extracellular matrix structure with a biconvex shape that enables it to focus light. Here we investigated how this shape is influenced by the source of one of its major components, the polysaccharide chitin. Knocking down the chitin synthase Krotzkopf verkehrt reduced corneal lens thickness and curvature. Conversely, enhancing chitin export by overexpressing Rebuf expanded the corneal lens. We found that the cone and primary pigment cells in the center of each ommatidium produce most of the chitin, and preventing chitin synthesis by these central cells reduced corneal lens curvature. Increasing chitin export from central cells increased the thickness of the central corneal lens, while increasing export from peripheral lattice cells expanded its edges. The biconvex shape thus results from high levels of chitin production by central cells relative to peripheral cells, indicating that localized chitin secretion is critical for normal corneal lens curvature.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Common swifts (Apus apus) nest in cavities and cracks in building facades and roofs. It is a declining species in Europe, partly due to the loss of suitable breeding habitat caused by urban building renovation (e.g. thermal insulation). In several countries, building renovation projects imply quantifying the amount of habitat occupied by swifts that will be destructed, and proposing compensatory measures, such as installing nest boxes in the renovated building. A difficulty is that nesting swifts are uneasy to detect visually. 2. Here we report a new video method we used to improve swift nest detection. It is based on continuous filming of a building's facade (for 1-2 hours), and later video-frame fusion to reveal swift flying in and out of cavities in the facade. 3. We succesfully used this method on two large building renovation projects, revealing larger than expected breeding populations (78 nests), and resulting in the implementation of ambitious compensation measures (212 nestboxes), commensurate with the habitat actually destroyed. 4. Based on a continuous dataset of swift passages during a full breeding season, we discuss favorable period in the season and day hours to efficiently detect nesting activity and assess building occupancy. 5. Solution. A video method is proposed to survey bird populations nesting in walls or cliffs. Video frame fusion reveals the fleeting movements of birds to their hidden nests. We provide software to use this tool in conservation projects, in particular ecological inventories prior to building renovation work.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

G.; Zhang, K.; Li, R.", "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is essential for the replication and stable maintenance of the viral episome in infected cells. Here, we identify the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 as a key regulator of EBNA1 through site-specific SUMOylation. Our Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis revealed that PIAS1 is enriched at the viral origin of plasmid replication (oriP), where it physically associates with EBNA1 and catalyzes its SUMOylation. Using mutational analysis, we identified three lysine residues on EBNA1 (K17, K75, and K241) as major SUMOylation sites. Disruption of these sites compromises EBNA1s ability to restrict EBV lytic replication. In addition, both PIAS1 depletion and the disruption of EBNA1 SUMOylation lead to reduced retention of EBNA1-OriP-based EBV mini-replicon, indicating the importance of EBNA1 SUMOylation in viral episome maintenance. Together, these results uncover a conserved post-translational mechanism by which PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation modulates EBNA1 function and EBV episome maintenance and suggests a broader role for SUMOylation in viral latency, lytic replication and persistence.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

This raises a fundamental question: how can excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synapses co-adapt through homeostatic plasticity without disrupting network function or relying on fine-tuned parameters? We propose a solution grounded in the multidimensional nature of intracellular calcium signaling, which independently regulates protein synthesis at E and I synapses. By analytically characterizing calcium dynamics driven by spike-train statistics, we show that calcium's mean encodes firing rate, while its variance reflects spike-time irregularity, two complementary features critical for stable yet flexible spiking. Leveraging this dual signal, we construct a closed-loop model in which inhibitory synapses are regulated by calcium's mean and excitatory synapses by its variance through independent pathways. This mechanism preserves irregular spiking and stabilizes firing rates across diverse inputs. Strikingly, it also yields the empirically observed weakening of synaptic strengths with the number of inputs K as 1\\{surd}K, leading to the spontaneous emergence of balanced excitatory-inhibitory dynamics. These results uncover a calcium-driven regulatory principle linking intracellular signaling to the origin of balanced activity in cortical networks.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Using a mouse model of the local Shwartzman reaction, we show that JSP1 is essential for LPS-TNF-induced vascular injury. JSP1-deficient mice exhibited reduced vascular hemorrhage. Neutrophil depletion and adoptive transfer experiments confirmed that JSP1-expressing neutrophils mediate this injury. JSP1 was not required for neutrophil development or surface receptor abundance but was essential for integrin activation and adhesion. Reduced SYK and HCK phosphorylation in JSP1-deficient neutrophils are consistent with a mechanism involving impaired integrin-SRC signaling.

These adaptations can include biofilm formation, where the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances can protect the cells from a hostile environment, or, under nutrient-limited conditions, pseudohyphal or hyphal growth, where the colony can send out long 'tendrils' to explore the environment and seek nutrients. Recently, we observed a spiral colony morphology emerge in an isolate of the hyphae-forming yeast Magnusiomyces magnusii grown under laboratory conditions. We use an off-lattice agent-based model (ABM) that simulates colony development to investigate the hypothesis that the spiral morphology is the result of bias in the hyphal branching angle. The model involves biologically-motivated rules of hyphal growth and branching, with key model parameters including the colony size at the onset of hyphal filaments, and the branching angle. Using one example of an experimentally-grown colony, we use a sequential neural likelihood method to perform likelihood-free Bayesian inference to infer the model parameters. Our results indicate a mean hyphal branching angle of 2.3 degrees [1.1, 3.6] (95% credible interval).

Here, we demonstrate that LRE mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagic capacity are critical for efficient nutrient uptake and maintenance of their specialized identity, as disruption of either process leads to premature differentiation into adult enterocytes with diminished endolysosomal and metabolic activity. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that neonatal LREs exhibit a distinctive antioxidant signature, which preserves redox balance and safeguards the expression of the transcriptional regulators MAFB and BLIMP1, both central repressors of the neonatal-to-adult metabolic transition. These findings establish the mitochondria-lysosome axis as a key determinant of LRE function and neonatal metabolic programming.

A common example is the suppression of responses to repetitive stimuli in sensory cortices, a phenomenon known as habituation. Within a sensory information stream, whenever a novel stimulus deviates from expectations, enhanced brain responses are observed. Mismatch negativity (MMN), the electroencephalographic waveform reflecting rule violations, is a well-established biomarker for auditory deviant detection. MMN has been shown to depend on intact NMDA receptor signaling across species; nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms at the neuronal and mesoscale levels are still not fully understood. Using multi-electrode array recordings in awake mice, we identified a specific biphasic spiking response in a subpopulation of primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons elicited by deviant, but not standard, sounds, wherein the second peak is abolished by acute sub-anesthetic injection of ketamine, a partial non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. We further showed that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a critical hub for multisensory integration and sensorimotor coordination, responds to unexpected and deviant, but not repetitive, sounds, and this response is dependent upon intact NMDA receptor-mediated signaling. Finally, to explore the effects of ketamine on inter-cortical communication following deviance detection, we performed Granger Causality and Weighted Phase Lag Index analyses during the presentation of deviant and standard sounds. This analysis showed a unidirectional functional connectivity from A1 to PPC following deviant detection, which is impaired by ketamine administration.

Methods: This study identified differential expression (DE) of TFs in 74 GA samples using NGS, biostatistical analysis in R, and comparison with 68 normal tissue samples in the genetic databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Results: 1,564 human transcription factors were DE. Of these, 87 were selected using the established cutoff value of AUC [&ge;] 0.95, and 25 were analyzed for their influence on GA carcinogenesis. Based on their role in biological processes, nine TFs were found to be underexpressed due to their growth suppression and cell differentiation properties, notably the TFs IRF3 and CXXC1. Sixteen TFs were overexpressed, associated with drug resistance, disease promotion, metastasis, and poor prognosis in GA, such as AhR, NCoA3, RRB1, and STAT3, respectively.

Here, we systematically assessed these effects in mice using a harmonised meta-analysis workflow, reprocessing raw sequence data end-to-end. We conducted a harmonised meta-analysis of the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon data from three independent mouse studies (n = 54) spanning dietary and intraperitoneal rapamycin interventions with matched controls. All samples were uniformly processed using a standardised 16S rRNA bioinformatics workflow. Genus-level abundances were modelled using two complementary approaches: a per-study zero-inflated beta modelling framework with random-effects meta-analysis, and a batch-corrected linear modelling framework incorporating correction prior to meta-analysis. Dose-response meta-regression assessed whether rapamycin-associated changes scaled with dose (42-990 mg/kg), integrating presence and magnitude of effects across heterogeneous study designs. Rapamycin treatment induced reproducible shifts in specific taxa across studies, with a subset of core responders consistently altered regardless of dose. Among the core responders, Bacteroides increased (OR = 1.59, q = 0.042) and Muribaculum decreased (OR = 0.55, q = 0.042), each significant in both frameworks.

Dose-sensitivity analyses highlighted Lachnospiraceae as the most consistent dose-sensitive taxon, with other associations largely restricted to extreme doses. Functional pathway analysis revealed alterations in energy metabolism and microbial stress response.

Alterations to the three-dimensional (3D) spatial interactions among gene regulatory elements are increasingly recognized as a mechanism by which genetic variants influence gene expression. However, experimentally evaluating whether variants disrupt 3D-genome structure is not feasible at GWAS scale. To address this, we developed a computational framework that integrates GWAS summary statistics with predictions from the Akita sequence-based deep learning model of 3D chromatin contacts. We applied the framework to 9,917 genomic regions associated with human height, assessing both individual variants and haplotypes for their predicted impact on 3D genome architecture. Only a small fraction of height-associated haplotypes had substantial predicted disruption of 3D folding (17 regions, 0.17%, exceeded a disruption score of 0.1). Considering all common variants in a haplotype together generally produced greater perturbations than individual variants, but several highly divergent regions were driven by single variants. We highlight a variant that disrupts the binding motif at a confirmed CTCF binding site and is predicted to modify 3D genome contacts with the LCOR promoter, suggesting that 3D-genome-mediated disruption of gene regulation underlies the association with height.

Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) enables non-invasive mapping of white matter pathways and construction of the brain's structural connectome, but its application to the fetal brain has been limited by data scarcity and technical difficulties in analyzing fetal dMRI data. Here, we present the largest study to date of in utero brain connectivity, analyzing high-quality dMRI data from 198 fetuses between 22 and 37 gestational weeks, from the Developing Human Connectome Project. We employed advanced fetal-specific tools for brain segmentation, parcellation, and tractography. For connection weighting, we relied on the notion of fiber bundle capacity. We reconstructed individual structural connectomes and characterized the developmental trajectories. Graph-theoretical analysis revealed consistent increases in integration and segregation metrics over gestation, alongside stable small-world properties. Bootstrapping confirmed the robustness of nodal and edge-wise developmental patterns, and a sigmoid growth model identified a narrow time window (around 27.5-30.5 weeks) of rapid connectivity strengthening. Furthermore, we proposed a novel method for constructing age-specific connectome templates based on aggregation of individual subject connectomes. Our analysis shows that this approach is superior to spatial alignment and averaging of the data in image space, with the connectome templates preserving individual topology and supporting accurate age prediction.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that is used both preclinically and clinically for the assessment of anatomy and tissue function. Here we describe an MRI technique for following the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes during the spontaneous regenerative process of remyelination in vivo.

Oatp1a1 mediates cell uptake of a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent (Primovist), allowing detection of the cells in T1-weighted MR images. Uptake of the contrast agent is restricted to MBP-expressing cells, which is most highly expressed during myelin sheath formation, thereby allowing progenitor-mediated, and potentially oligodendrocyte-mediated, remyelination to be monitored non-invasively in vivo using MRI.

Previous studies, with predominantly small samples, primarily focused on selected limbic regions and functional measures. Thus, this study investigates associations between brain structure and cortisol responses to psychosocial stress, exploring if hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity can be predicted from brain morphology. Methods: Our study included 291 subjects (157 females, 18-62 years) and consisted of two parts. First, a confirmatory analysis examined associations between specific cortical surface area, thickness, and subcortical volume with stress-induced cortisol increases using Permutation Analysis of Linear Models (PALM). Second, we conducted an exploratory whole-brain vertex-wise analysis, followed by out-of-sample prediction of cortisol increases from structural measures. Results: We found consistent negative associations between cingulate cortex (CC) sub-structures and acute cortisol increases. In PALM- and whole-brain analysis, a smaller surface area of the left rostral and caudal anterior cingulate cortex (cACC), posterior cingulate cortex, and right cACC were associated with higher cortisol stress responses, particularly in males. The left cACC surface area emerged as the most promising predictor in machine learning analyses. Additionally, other fronto-limbic structures were also associated with or predictive of acute cortisol reactivity. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that cortical and subcortical structural measures, particularly smaller surface areas of the CC, predict acute hormonal stress responses.

This hypothesis was tested for adults with and without dyslexia using electroencephalography (EEG) during a rhythmic audiovisual speech paradigm, previously delivered to children. Participants viewed a \"talking head\" repeating the syllable \"ba\" at a 2-Hz rate. Measures were neural phase entrainment and band power in the delta, theta, beta (15-25 Hz), and low gamma (25-40 Hz) bands, and broadband event-related potentials (ERPs), focusing on the N1 and P2 components. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and phase-phase coupling (PPC) were also assessed for delta-theta, delta-beta, theta-beta, delta-gamma, and theta-gamma interactions. Both groups exhibited significant delta- and theta-band phase entrainment; however, the two groups differed significantly in the preferred phase for the theta band. While the control group showed consistent beta- and low gamma-band phase entrainment, this was not observed for the dyslexic group. There was significantly greater delta-band power for the dyslexic group across the whole brain and in the right temporal region. Additionally, the P2 ERP component differed significantly between groups. The data are interpreted with respect to TS theory.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Neurite outgrowth is essential for neural circuit formation and is tightly regulated by secreted factors and their receptors. The secreted extracellular domain of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) has been shown to modulate neurite outgrowth. Recently, the gamma amino butyric acid receptor type-B subunit 1a (GABABR1a) was identified as an sAPPalpha binding partner that mediates its effects on synaptic transmission. Here, we investigated whether this interaction also regulates neurite outgrowth. In primary hippocampal neurons, the GABABR agonist baclofen reduced axon length; whereas, its antagonist CGP54626 increased axon length in primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, GABABR1a knockout increased axon length and abolished the effect of baclofen. Application of sAPPalpha reduced axon length, an effect that required the presence of both GABABR1a and the extension domain of sAPPalpha, which mediates its binding to GABABR1a. Similarly, the APP 17mer peptide, which is sufficient to bind GABABR1a and mimic the effects of sAPP on synaptic transmission, reduced axon outgrowth in wildtype but not in GABABR1a-deficient neurons. Together, these findings indicate that the 1a isoform contributes to GABABR-dependent suppression of neurite outgrowth and mediates the inhibitory effect of sAPPalpha on neurite outgrowth.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

L.; Nazir, Z. A.; Silveira, M. A.", "abstract": "The neurotransmitter serotonin modulates a variety of behavioral and physiological responses in the brain. Serotonergic neurons from the dorsal raphe nuclei send a dense projection to the auditory system, including the inferior colliculus (IC), the midbrain hub of the central auditory system. In the IC, serotonin alters how neurons respond to complex sounds, and it has been implicated in the generation or perception of tinnitus. However, the distribution of serotonergic receptors and the identity of neurons that express serotonergic receptors in the IC remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that IC GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons differentially express serotonergic receptors. To test this hypothesis, we performed in situ hybridization in IC brain slices of male and female mice using probes for Vgat (GABAergic neuron marker) and Vglut2 (glutamatergic neuron marker), along with probes for six subtypes of metabotropic serotonergic receptors: 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B (Htr1a and Htr1b, inhibitory, Gi/o G protein receptors), 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C (Htr2a, Htr2b, and Htr2c excitatory, Gq11 G protein receptors) and, 5-HT7 (excitatory, Gs G protein receptors). Our data show that glutamatergic IC neurons primarily express inhibitory serotonergic receptors. In contrast, a larger proportion of GABAergic neurons express excitatory serotonergic receptors. Our data suggest that serotonin exerts an inhibitory net effect on IC neuronal circuits. These findings contribute to our understanding of how serotonin signaling influences auditory processing. The differential expression of serotonergic receptors may help shape the balance of excitation and inhibition in the auditory midbrain, affecting sound processing.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that disease-specific tau conformations determine unique interactors across Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Through interactome profiling of misfolded tau aggregates from PBS- and sarkosyl-soluble fractions, we identified 493 high-confidence proteins with disease specificity and no overlap across diseases. Machine learning classification achieved compelling discrimination between diseases, demonstrating molecular signatures underlying clinical heterogeneity. AD tau aggregates engaged cellular metabolism machinery and glutamate/GABA cycling components, showing 27-fold enrichment over other tauopathies. PSP tau displayed the most distinctive profile, with protein depletion and selective enrichment of proteasome components. DLB tau associated with neurogenesis modulators while depleting neuroinflammatory mediators. These interactors were validated through proximity ligation assays and correlated with distinct post-translational modifications. Critically, sarkosyl-soluble fractions revealed reduced interactome complexity across diseases, except PSP tau which maintained interactions with GPCR-ERK signaling and kinetochore proteins, suggesting unique aggregation mechanisms.

Existing methods focus primarily on the prediction of variant effects in terms of their deleteriousness, without taking into account the disease-specific context, and are therefore limited in terms of their utility in real-world diagnosis and decision making. Here, we introduce disease-specific variant pathogenicity prediction (DIVA), a novel deep learning framework that directly predicts specific disease types alongside the probability of deleteriousness for missense variants. Our approach integrates information from two different modalities -- protein sequence and disease-related textual annotations -- encoded using two pre-trained language models and optimized within a contrastive learning paradigm designed to align variants with relevant diseases in the learned representation space. Our results demonstrate that DIVA outperforms baselines and provides accurate disease predictions with high relevance to clinically curated disease annotations for missense variants. Variant deleteriousness prediction is enhanced by incorporating AlphaMissense scores through learnable weights derived from protein function annotations, which additionally boosts DIVA's ability to accurately classify deleterious variants.

Our study demonstrates that robust YAP1 activation in metastatic melanoma correlates with poor survival and drives transcriptional programs linked to therapeutic resistance. Mechanistically, YAP1 predominantly remodels the chromatin landscape in resistant tumors by partnering with BRD4 and TEAD, creating a permissive transcriptional state that sustains oncogenic signaling. Clinical validation in biopsies from resistant melanoma confirms elevated expression of YAP1 target genes. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 or TEAD reduces YAP1-driven transcription and reactivates antitumor immunity programs. TEAD specific inhibitors (and not verteporfin which is a highly non-specific inhibitor) synergize with immune checkpoint blockade in in vivo model system by promoting increased CD8 T cell infiltration and prolonged survival in the melanoma mouse model. Collectively, these findings reveal a chromatin-centric vulnerability in BRAF/MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma and propose TEAD specific inhibitors as a promising dual strategy to overcome resistance and reinvigorate the immune response, offering a novel therapeutic avenue for patients.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of these properties in C. albicans EVs obtained through three commonly utilized isolation protocols documented in the literature. After identifying the most efficient isolation method for optimal yield, we devised a potential quality control for EVs isolation based on protein and sterol ratio. Subsequently, we investigated the impact of drying EVs using vacuum centrifugation at room temperature or -4 {degrees}C and the effect of freeze-thaw cycles in EVs stability. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that EVs maintained morphological stability after long-term (up to 4 years) storage at -80 {degrees}C as well as storage at room temperature, 4 {degrees}C and -20 {degrees}C for 7 days with or without vacuum centrifugation, with a tendency of higher recovery when lower temperature is used. Remarkably, all of the C. albicans EVs suspensions maintained their biological properties as demonstrated by their ability to protect Galleria mellonella against C. albicans infection. However, the number of freeze-thaw cycles significantly impacted on the protective effect of the EVs.

To acquire insights into the in vivo contribution of sadB to virulence in a mouse soft tissue infection model, we employed bioluminescence imaging and histopathology. Compared with the parent PAO1 strain, the {Delta}sadB mutant was highly attenuated and rapidly cleared from the infection site whereas genetic complementation conferring constitutive expression of sadB resulted in a much more persistent phenotype. Transcriptome analysis of exponential and stationary phase planktonic cells revealed that SadB modulates expression of diverse genes involved in biofilm development, quorum sensing (QS), secondary metabolite production, iron acquisition, virulence, protein secretion and anaerobiosis. In {Delta}sadB, we observed log phase induction of the rhl and pqs QS systems, increased production of siderophores and pyocyanin, differential regulation of genes involved in c-di-GMP signalling and a growth defect under static conditions. Since {Delta}sadB is a hyperswarmer and as swarming requires rhamnolipids, this suggested that deletion of sadB may impact on the timing and level of rhamnolipids produced. In {Delta}sadB, the rhlA and rhlB genes were induced in log rather than stationary phase resulting in overproduction of rhamnolipids. Since they also contribute to biofilm maturation and dispersal and can act as anti-adhesives, we deleted the rhlA in {Delta}sadB and observed that biofilm formation was restored offering mechanistic insight into the biofilm defective phenotype of {Delta}sadB. SadB clearly has a more global role than previously appreciated and acts as a master regulator of diverse genes involved in environmental adaptation, biofilm formation and virulence.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

This is important for essential cellular functions including migration, cell shape control and cleavage furrow positioning during cell division. Asymmetrically dividing Drosophila neural stem cells, called neuroblasts, exhibit stereotypic patterns of Myosin dynamics along the cell cycle. Some of the Myosin dynamics manifest as flows and are important to asymmetrically position the cleavage furrow which establishes the cell size-difference between the neuroblast and its daughter cell. Myosin can be regulated by small GTPases and their GAPs and GEFs, providing spatio-temporal control. Rho kinase downstream of the small GTPase Rho regulates Myosin activity, yet the regulation and contribution of its GEFs and GAPs to asymmetric neuroblast division are not resolved. Here, we systematically analysed the localization of RhoGAPs and RhoGEFs expressed in neuroblasts and identified the ARHGAP19 homolog RhoGAP54D as a regulator of Myosin dynamics. A cytoplasmic pool of RhoGAP54D suppresses pulsatile Myosin activity during interphase and metaphase, regulated by the nucleoporin Members Only via slow nuclear import. In anaphase RhoGAP54D is recruited to the apical cortex and constitutes the trigger that initiates the directional Myosin flow that positions the cleavage furrow. This depends on PsGEF which is itself recruited downstream of Par3/Baz and Pins, linking cell polarity to RhoGAP54D activity to promote daughter cell size asymmetry during neuroblast division.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Super-resolution microscopy and semi-automated measurements reveal that cell or nuclear volume in interphase, or the time spent in mitosis (both previously proposed chromosome size determinants), have little influence on resultant chromosome dimensions. Instead, levels of the chromosomal condensin complex affect chromosome size, with increasing condensin levels resulting in more compact, shorter and thinner, chromosomes.

Microtubules form longitudinal non-centrosomal arrays that are essential for organelle positioning and facilitate the directional trafficking of cargoes within polarized epithelial cells. The apical actin cytoskeleton is crucial for supporting cell shape and overall tissue architecture. This study investigates the interplay between apical actin dynamics and microtubule organization in vivo within Drosophila epithelial tissue. We show that the loss of Cyclase-Associated Protein (CAP) leads to the excessive accumulation of unusually stable actin structures at the apical cortex, which subsequently exclude microtubules and membrane-bound vesicles. In CAP mutant cells, the apical localization of microtubule minus-end organizing proteins is impaired, emphasizing the role of actin dynamics in microtubule anchoring. Consequently, non-centrosomal microtubule-dependent processes are impaired, leading to nuclear mispositioning, disrupted apical cargo transport, and ultimately defective microvilli formation in CAP mutant cells. Our findings highlight that rapid apical actin turnover, catalyzed by CAP, is critical for the organization of non-centrosomal microtubules. This study emphasizes the intricate crosstalk between actin filaments and microtubules, and how crosstalk between actin filaments and microtubules sustains the polarized functions of epithelial tissues.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

In C. elegans muscle IACs exist at the bases of dense bodies and M-lines, and at the boundaries of adjacent muscle cells (MCBs). We have reported that the proper assembly of IACs requires the Rac GEF PIX-1 and members of the PIX-1 pathway. Here we report that further investigation into the original Million Mutation Project strain that led us to uncover the role of PIX-1 in muscle, revealed a genetic enhancer of the PIX-1 phenotype. Genetic mapping shows that the enhancer is a recessive mutation in a single gene, ipmk-1. ipmk-1, encodes inositol phosphate multikinase and converts PIP2 to PIP3, IP3 to IP4, and IP4 to IP5. Loss of function of pix-1 results in reduced accumulation of IAC proteins at the MCB, and ipmk-1; pix-1 double mutants additionally display a large gap between adjacent muscle cells. ipmk-1 similarly enhances other members of the PIX pathway including PAK-1, and the RacGAP RRC-1. Lack of ipmk-1 itself results in abnormal clumping of IAC components at the MCB, decreased whole animal locomotion, and mild sarcomere disorganization. Analysis of ipmk-1; ipp-5 double mutants suggest that the MCB defect of ipmk-1 is due to decreased PIP3 in the cell membrane rather than the decreased IP3 and Ca2+ signaling. Overall, these studies provide in vivo evidence, specifically in muscle, that the level of PIP3 and PIP2 influence the proper assembly of IACs.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) play pivotal roles in linking mitogenic signals to G1 to S phase progression, and their frequent deregulation in various cancers underscores their importance in driving cell proliferation and as therapeutic targets. Despite this, the roles of CDK4/6 beyond the G1/S transition remain underexplored. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognised function of CDK4/6 in mitotic progression through regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)6. Using both cancer and non-transformed human cells, we show that acute CDK4/6 inhibition after G1/S transition leads to premature mitotic exit despite unattached kinetochores, resulting in chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. Phosphoproteomic analyses and in vitro kinase assays reveal that CDK4 phosphorylates multiple sites on key SAC regulators, including the C-terminal tail of CENP-E, which is critical for BubR1 recruitment to kinetochores and SAC maintenance. CDK4/6 inhibition reduces the phosphorylation of SAC components, attenuating checkpoint signalling and accelerating mitotic slippage. Notably, residual SAC activity persists, suggesting that CDK4/6 strengthens or stabilises SAC signalling rather than being essential for its activation. Thus, CDK4/6 functions extend beyond G1/S control to ensure mitotic fidelity, linking proliferating signals to genome stability and exposing potential vulnerabilities to anti-mitotic therapies in cancer.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

In neurons, this accumulation is spatially restricted to somatodendritic endosomes. These APP-containing endosomes are catalytically inactive and lack the {gamma}-secretase subunit PSEN2.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of C. auris uptake and intracellular processing by immune cells such as macrophages is thus critical for counteracting the spreading of respective infections. Here, we show that phagocytosis of C. auris cells by primary human macrophages involves the formation of dot-like F-actin-rich structures at C. auris-containing phagosomes that we characterize as phagocytic podosomes. We analyse the composition, architecture, and dynamics of these structures, showing that they constitute a specific and highly dynamic adaptation of the phagocytic actin network of macrophages. We also show that disruption of phagocytic podosomes is associated with reduced internalization of C. auris cells and delayed maturation of respective phagosomes. Our data provide novel insights into the uptake mechanism and cytoskeletal rearrangements upon internalization of Candida by immune cells, while also challenging the dogma of a generally uniform and continuous actin network within phagocytic cups. At the same time, we identify C. auris as the first pathophysiologically relevant target whose internalization involves the formation of phagocytic podosomes.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

J.; Kmoch,", "abstract": "Background: ADTKD MUC1 is caused by frameshift mutations in MUC1 gene that produce a frameshifted protein (MUC1fs) toxic to kidney cells. The gene s variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), with high GC content, makes it largely inaccessible to standard sequencing. As a result, both the reference sequence and natural variation in this region remain poorly defined, complicating mutation detection and data interpretation. Standard methods also fail to pinpoint the exact VNTR unit affected, limiting insight into mutation mechanisms and genotype/phenotype correlations. Methods: We employed Single Molecule, Real Time (SMRT) sequencing and characterized the genomic sequence of MUC1 in 300 individuals including 279 individuals from 143 families suspected of having ADTKD MUC1. We compared these results to those obtained using the CLIA approved mass spectrometry based probe extension (PE) assay, which specifically detect the most prevalent 59dupC mutation. We correlated the structural features of the MUC1 VNTR with the rate of kidney function decline in affected individuals. Results: We identified MUC1 consensus sequences for 205 unique VNTR alleles, with 9 distinct types of frameshift mutations present on 52 distinct mutated VNTR alleles. MUC1 frameshift mutations were identified in 71 of 143 families (50%) with suspected ADTKD, comprising 135 genetically affected individuals (48%). The SMRT assay exhibited complete concordance and revealed that the PE assay is capable of detecting frameshift mutations in approximately 85% of affected families. The constellation of VNTR structures supports a genotype progression model, in which fast progressors exhibit a significantly lower number of repeat units on the wild type allele and a higher number of repeats on the mutation bearing allele, including an increased number of frameshifted repeat units. Conclusions: SMRT sequencing outperforms current diagnostic methods for ADTKD-MUC1 and reveals the prognostic value of VNTR structures. Although their contribution to disease progression is modest (~6% variance explained), it remains biologically and clinically meaningful.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

In recent years, enormous progress has been made in translating sequence information into structural information using machine learning approaches.

In the present study, we show that it is possible to create two-dimensional contact maps from sequences, for which only a few exemplary structures are available on a laptop without the need for GPUs or high-performance computing clusters. This is achieved by using a pattern matching approach. The resulting contact maps largely reflect the interactions in the three-dimensional structures. The validity of our method was tested on the 25 protein domains, with abundant structural data, achieving correlations of 0.73-0.94 between predicted and experimental contact maps.

We additionally recruited three control groups: 8 permanently congenitally blind individuals, 11 individuals with reversed later-onset cataracts (developmental cataract reversal individuals), and 24 age- and sex-matched typically sighted controls. Diffusion tensor metrics exhibited significant group differences which were specific to visual tracts. Compared to normally sighted controls, congenitally blind and congenital cataract reversal individuals both showed impaired white matter integrity. However, differences were much more spatially extensive for permanently congenitally blind individuals, and a direct comparison revealed relatively higher tract integrity for congenital cataract reversal individuals, suggesting a high degree of recovery following sight restoration.

We use a one-dimensional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for feature extraction of single-channel temporal series and a linear classifier for segment classification. We trained the network using data from 37 patients containing manual annotations of ictal and Low-Voltage Fast Activity (LVFA) by clinicians. The 1D VAE encodes two-second SEEG segments into a low-dimensional representation in latent space and then classifies them as interictal, ictal, or LVFA segments. We used 5-fold cross-validation for training and validation. Our system classified ictal vs. interictal 2 second segments with an average recall of 0.88. For whole-channel seizure annotation, we combine the probabilities of all its segments and compute the Area Under Curve (AUC) of the exponentially smoothed probability signal, marking the onset of both ictal and LVFA, a high average recall of 0.86, with even higher performance (0.91) on channels identified by clinicians as belonging to the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ). The markers were also temporally accurate, with a mean (median) time lag of 9.8 (5.0) seconds for the ictal onset and a mean (median) lag of 2.0 (0.8) seconds for LVFA. Additionally, latent space analysis suggests that multiple dimensions correlate with class-relevant SEEG features that the classifier pays attention to, most notably amplitude and spectral power, which provides an explainability component to the network. As a secondary objective, we obtain a seizure detection recall of 99\\% with a specificity of 95\\%.

Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in rats are modulated by various behavioral contexts and are thought to represent affective-like states. However, their diversity during palatable food consumption remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated acoustic features of USVs in male rats consuming chocolate, a highly palatable food. Using a machine-learning-assisted logistic regression model trained on spectrogram features, we identified a distinct USV subtype -- the 40-kHz inverted-U type -- that was selectively emitted during chocolate consumption. The emission of this subtype was tightly time-locked to chocolate feeding behavior. Systemic administration of naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the emission of the 40-kHz inverted-U USVs during chocolate intake. These findings suggest that these USVs may reflect internal states associated with palatable feeding and are under modulation by the endogenous opioid system. Moreover, our data demonstrate the utility of machine learning for high-throughput, objective classification of USV subtypes. This framework provides a promising approach for decoding emotion-related vocal expressions in rats and highlights the potential of specific USVs as behavioral readouts for studying the neurobiology of positive emotions.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

PEPCK inhibitors limited CD8+ T cell cytotoxic capacity and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell inflammatory cytokine production. Suppression of T cell effector functions by PEPCK inhibitors was associated with decreased maximal mitochondrial respiration.

The usefulness of nucleoside labelling in standard rodent xenograft models is limited due to the extended labelling durations as a result of intraperitoneal route of administration. Due to its easy accessibility, the CAM allows xenograft S-phase nuclei to be labelled in as little as 30 minutes in vivo for a large number of biological replicates in parallel. We show that for the BxPC-3 and AsPC-1 cell lines, nucleoside labelling with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) can be multiplexed successfully with other cell-cycle markers such as cyclin B1 and Ki67, especially when combined with digital image analysis techniques. The latter also allows for accurate human versus chicken cell segmentation. Moreover, starting from embryonic day of development 14 (ED14), we observe the presence of a chicken embryonic cell type that appears to possess a high-quantity of extranuclear accumulation of EdU. Initial assessment of these cells showed that they are likely (non-proliferating) granulocytes which can be found in the embryonic liver of grafted and non-grafted embryos, as well as in xenograft sections. Importantly, these cells do not express chicken MHC II, in turn making it less likely that they represent professional antigen presenting cells. Our findings demonstrate that the CAM xenograft model can be used as a valuable tool to study the cell cycle of tumour cells in vivo.

We previously demonstrated that von Willebrand factor (VWF) regulates angiogenesis and vascular integrity, the likely mechanism underlying angiodysplasia. VWF controls the storage of the angiogenesis regulator Angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2) in endothelial cells (EC), suggesting a candidate for the genesis of angiodysplasia; however, no direct evidence of the role of Angpt-2 in VWF-dependent angiogenesis is available. Here we use VWF-deficient HUVEC, and endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) from severe VWD patients and find that loss of VWF in EC results in increased Angpt-2 expression through a positive feedback loop via the Angpt-2-TIE2-AKT-FOXO1 pathway. We also show an imbalance of the Angpt/Tie2 pathway in vivo. In the gut of VWF-deficient mice, Angpt-2 expression is increased whilst Angpt-1 expression is decreased; this correlates with reduced expression of the pericyte marker NG2. These data suggest that VWF regulates the Angpt/Tie2 balance in the gut. To investigate the functional defects caused by loss of VWF, we use a fibrin bead assay and show that VWF-deficient HUVEC present increased sprouting. We develop a microfluidic model of 3D vasculogenesis/angiogenesis and find that ECFCs from VWD patients exhibit defective remodeling and abnormal lumen formation compared to healthy controls. Importantly, inhibition of Angpt-2 reduces sprouting in VWF-deficient HUVEC and normalises vascular networks in ECFCs from severe VWD, suggesting Angpt-2 inhibitors may be effective in VWD patients with GI bleeding and angiodysplasia.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

While tobacco exposure is an established risk factor for PDAC incidence and influences patient survival, the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating these effects remain poorly understood. We aimed to characterize the causal pathways linking tobacco exposure to PDAC patient survival, focusing on DNA methylation and tumor immune infiltration as potential mediators. For this purpose, we developed HDMAX2-surv, an extension of high-dimensional mediation analysis method HDMAX2, adapted to survival outcomes. Through extensive simulations across multiple scenarios, we demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods in handling complex DNA methylation data. We integrated this approach with causal discovery frameworks and immune deconvolution algorithms to dissect multi-pathway mediation mechanisms. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort of 145 PDAC patients, we identified 37 aggregated methylated regions (AMRs) with significant mediation effects, exhibiting both protective and deleterious impacts on survival. Our causal discovery analysis revealed complex relationships where tobacco effects operate through sequential pathways involving DNA methylation and immune infiltration changes. Serial mediation analysis identified four distinct pathways where tobacco-induced epigenetic modifications mediate survival effects through immune microenvironment alterations, involving the HIST1H4E, NAA11, SPTBN2, and CHL1 loci. Remarkably, these effects were undetectable through gene expression analysis alone, highlighting the unique value of methylation-based approaches.

We performed a comprehensive RNA-sequencing analysis of B. sorokiniana during attack on spot-blotch-resistant and susceptible wheat genotypes, integrating differentially expressed genes (DEGs), alternative splicing (AS) events, and identification of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The pathogen exhibited extensive host-genotype-dependent transcriptomic reprogramming, with 128 pathogen genes upregulated in the susceptible host. These genes were associated with ribosome biogenesis, RNA processing, and primary metabolic functions, supporting aggressive colonization. In contrast, pathogen attack on the resistant genotype triggered the upregulation of 58 pathogen genes associated with stress-responsive pathways, including sphingolipid and ceramide metabolism. This suggests a shift toward defensive metabolic reprogramming in the resistant host that restricted its proliferation. Our investigation uncovered five classes of AS events and 14 differentially expressed lncRNAs, revealing substantial post-transcriptional complexity. Notably, a subunit of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complex emerged as a rare 'triple-hit' candidate simultaneously identified as a DEG, differentially alternatively spliced gene, and target of a differentially expressed lncRNA, highlighting its potential as a central regulatory node in host-responsive stress adaptation.

The nanoclusters were fabricated via a self-assembly approach using PLGA-PEG and cholesterol matrices to co-encapsulate pirfenidone (antifibrotic) and resveratrol (vascular protective agent). Physicochemical characterization confirmed uniform particle morphology, stable size distribution, and sustained colloidal stability. Pharmacokinetic evaluation revealed that nanoclusters achieved a delayed peak time and prolonged plateau phase, maintaining therapeutic drug concentrations in serum and hepatic tissue for up to 72 h, in contrast to the rapid clearance observed in micelle and free-drug formulations. Mechanistic investigations suggested that biomimetic surface engineering and electrostatic coupling contributed to suppressed burst release, enhanced retention in fibrotic microenvironments, and receptor-mediated uptake. Functional assays further demonstrated significant inhibition of hepatic stellate cell activation, reduction of collagen deposition, and improved endothelial tube formation. In a CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis mouse model, nanocluster treatment markedly decreased fibrotic area and enhanced CD31-positive vessel density without detectable systemic toxicity.

We exposed the flowers to playback sounds of bee buzzing, a similar synthetic sounds signal (200 Hz) and those with higher frequency (5000 Hz) and compared nectar sugar concentrations among these sound-treated and silent control flowers. We found an approximately 10% increase in nectar sugar concentration in response to playback sounds of bee buzzing and synthetic sounds signals at bee-like frequency (200 Hz), while no such response was observed under higher-frequency stimuli or silent condition in R. x pulchrum. A similar response to bee sounds was also observed in L. amplexicaule.

Here, we reverse-engineer a canonical neural circuit model that integrates sensory evidence and selects actions via distributed neuronal encoding, guided by data from a task that dissociates perceptual choice from motor response. The model's nonlinear gating of action selective (AS) neurons replicates parietal cortical activity observed during task performance. Critically, recurrent excitation within the evidence integration (EI) population supports sensory evidence accumulation, working memory for sequential sampling, and reward rate optimisation. Moreover, the dynamics of EI and AS neurons respectively mirror parietal activity related to sensory evidence encoding and ramping-to-threshold firing in a separate task, suggesting that decision readout engages both populations. The model also explains decision interference in a two-stage decision task, capturing observed accuracy decrements while predicting slower decisions. Together, these findings propose a foundational circuit-level mechanism unifying perceptual, memory-based, and abstract decision-making.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed powerful, non-invasive genetic tools to revisit the concept of SERPINA3N in brain development and injury. Brain-specific SERPINA3N overexpression neither alters neuronal or glial development nor improves cognitive ability under homeostasis. In stark contrast, SERPINA3N drives a pro-inflammatory response to brain injury and exacerbates blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Its overexpression promotes neurodegeneration through apoptosis-mediated neuronal loss and disrupts oligodendroglial differentiation and myelination following neonatal brain injury. Collectively, our findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of SERPINA3N in neurodevelopment and injury, revealing that while SERPINA3N is dispensable for neurobehavioral development, it aggravates neural injury and vascular damage under pathological conditions.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) agonists treat PD-associated motor deficits by acting on postsynaptic receptors located within the striatum that have been upregulated due dopamine loss. However, mechanisms that contribute to increased D2R activity in PD that enhance D2R function are poorly described. Spinophilin is a protein phosphatase 1 targeting protein that is expressed in postsynaptic dendritic spines and interacts with postsynaptic D2Rs. However, how spinophilin regulates D2R function is unknown. In the current study, we found that genetic knockout of spinophilin limited the suppression of locomotion caused by the D2R agonist, quinpirole. Mechanistically, we found that spinophilin is required for quinpirole-induced increases in the interaction of the D2R with intracellular proteins, suggesting spinophilin mediates agonist-induced D2R internalization. Therefore, our data support future studies targeting the spinophilin/D2R interaction to enhance the efficacy of current PD therapeutics.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

A.; Kajikawa, Y.", "abstract": "Amplitude-modulation (AM) plays an important role in the perception of complex sounds, and transformations in AM encoding may underlie aspects of complex sound perception. Previous studies have described a hierarchical progression across the auditory pathway, characterized by a decrease in the temporal precision of AM encoding. In human and nonhuman primates (NHP), the left hemisphere exhibits enhanced temporal encoding relative to the right hemisphere. The NHP model provides an opportunity to understand what circuit mechanisms generate these transformations in encoding by characterizing AM encoding in different intracortical circuits, and across the cortical hierarchy. To address this, here we report the encoding of AM signals as a function of cortical layer and hemisphere in NHP core and parabelt auditory cortex (AC). We recorded electrophysiological activity using linear array multielectrodes positioned across cortical layers while AM noise and click trains were presented to awake NHPs. Core AC typically encoded all AM frequencies (1.6-200 Hz) with high ( > 90%) classification accuracy, while sites in the parabelt encoded a subset of lower (~1.6-25 Hz) frequencies. Across both areas, the granular and infragranular layers displayed enhanced AM encoding relative to the supragranular layers. Both areas displayed enhanced AM encoding in the left hemisphere, restricted to the supragranular layers. These results represent the first analysis of AM encoding in the parabelt, indicating that significant temporal encoding of AM is still present in tertiary auditory cortex, and the layer-specific hemispheric differences suggest a potential supragranular layer origin of previously documented left-hemisphere dominance in temporal encoding.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), the master transcription factor, is pivotal in IFN induction, particularly in myeloid cells. Ubiquitination of IRF7 is essential for its transcriptional activation; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that deubiquitinases (DUBs) act as endogenous regulators of IRF7 activity and conducted a genetic screen using a human DUB-targeted siRNA library. This screen identified USP2 as a positive regulator and OTUD5 as a negative regulator of IRF7 activity. OTUD5, an inducible DUB, physically interacted with IRF7 and inhibited its K63-linked ubiquitination, thereby suppressing IRF7 activation. Conversely, USP2 promoted IRF7 activity by binding to IRF7 and removing K27-linked ubiquitin chains, which we found to be inhibitory. Specifically, K27-linked ubiquitination impeded phosphorylation of IRF7, a critical step for its activation.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of age, hemisphere, and sex on claustrum volume. We used T1-weighted 3 Tesla MRI scans of 3,474 healthy participants ranging from 1 to 80 years of age, deep learning-based automated claustrum segmentation, and a normative modelling approach to delineate lifespan trajectories of claustrum volumes for both hemispheres and sexes.

Here, NRF2 was pharmacologically activated via CDDO-Me (hitherto referred to as CDDO) to reduce the negative consequences on AC16 human cardiomyocyte cell health and functions.

Our analysis revealed significant enrichment of proteins associated with conventional secretory pathways, including ER to Golgi transport, protein folding, and vesicle mediated trafficking. Functional validation confirmed that several of these proteins are critical for IL2 secretion, underscoring their direct roles in cytokine processing. In addition, time resolved profiling of PPIs and transcriptomic changes following T cell stimulation revealed dynamic remodeling of the cytokine secretion machinery, reflecting multilayered regulation at both the protein and gene expression levels.

Growing evidence shows that cellular metabolism is key to how these cells adapt to challenges. However, little is known about what drives glial metabolic reprogramming or whether molecules involved in astrocyte microglia crosstalk also regulate this process. Here, we explored this question focusing on Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 1 (SFRP1). SFRP1 is an astrocyte-derived factor induced by inflammatory cues and overexpressed in neurodegeneration, which fosters microglial response to inflammation through NFkappaB and HIF dependent programs. We combined mitochondrial morphometry (MitoTracker Red and MiNA analysis) with Seahorse extracellular flux assays (Mito Stress Test) to determine whether SFRP1 modulates glial bioenergetics in primary cultures of astrocytes and microglia from wild-type and Sfrp1-/- mice. We report that SFRP1 acts as a driver of astrocytic metabolic activation, preferentially enhancing glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. This effect is most pronounced during inflammation, when oxidative phosphorylation is restricted and SFRP1 enhances glycolytic flexibility to sustain energy demands. By contrast, microglia showed the expected LPS-driven glycolytic shift with minimal dependence on SFRP1 under monoculture conditions. These findings position SFRP1 as a candidate regulator of astrocyte-centered metabolic tuning during neuroinflammation, with implications for disorders such as Alzheimer s disease, in which SFRP1 is elevated.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

C.; Maguire-Zeiss, K. A.", "abstract": "Background: Healthy aging alone can lead to cognitive decline, decreased brain size, protein aggregation, accumulation of senescent cells and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Age-related neuroinflammation, as known as inflammaging, is thought to restrict brain plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular matrix structures surrounding fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, regulate plasticity and protect neurons from oxidative stress. Given the known impact of inflammaging on neural circuits, this study examines age-associated changes in PNN homeostasis, glial activation, and neuroinflammation in two brain regions relevant to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: We analyzed young (4-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) C57BL/6J male mice for several behavioral phenotypes [hippocampal-dependent spatial learning using the Barnes maze; locomotion and anxiety-related behaviors using Open field and T-maze]. Using immunostaining, PNNs (Wisteria floribunda agglutinin and aggrecan), PV interneurons, and microglial activation (Iba1) were quantified in both the hippocampus and dorsal striatum. Glial morphology was examined using a battery of cell body, branching, and endpoint analyses. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze changes in the gene expression of inflammatory and extracellular matrix markers. Results: Aged mice exhibited hippocampal-dependent memory deficits without alterations in locomotion or anxiety-related behavior. PNN counts increased in the aged hippocampus, particularly in CA2, with a higher proportion of WFA and aggrecan PNNs. In contrast, PNN homeostasis was maintained in the dorsal striatum. In general, Aged mice showed increases in microglial activation and a subset of inflammatory markers. We report brain region- and age- specific gene expression changes in complement, matrix metalloproteinases, and other inflammatory markers. Aged striatal microglia displayed an activated morphology with larger cell bodies and reduced branching, as well as increased expression of markers for microgliosis (Iba1, TREM2, CD68). Conclusions: These findings suggest that aging differentially affects neuroinflammation and PNN integrity across brain regions. The hippocampus exhibits PNN accumulation, neuroinflammation, and behavioral changes, whereas the striatum maintains PNN homeostasis concurrent with increased microglial activation. This work suggests that neuroinflammation contributes to age-related changes in PNNs and behavior underscoring the importance of region-specific therapeutic strategies targeting PNN regulation.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

We present a human self-assembling 3D model of the BBB in a microfluidic cell culture platform that allows culture of 48 models in parallel on one tissue culture plate. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes form highly reproducible BBB vascular networks under unidirectional perfusion and remain viable for a minimum of 14 days. Immunostaining reveals close cell-cell interactions with pericytes and astrocyte end-feet in direct contact with the brain microvasculature.

To achieve this, a correlative multimodal approach combining audiometric, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological biomarkers was performed. Adult mice were noise-exposed to broadband white noise (5-20 kHz) for 3 hours at either high (115 dB SPL) or moderate (90 dB SPL) intensity, while unexposed mice were used as controls. Separate cohorts of mice were investigated 1-, 7-, 56- and 84-days post-exposure using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter density (GMD), diffusion MRI (dMRI) of microstructure and connectivity, and single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) for glutamate and GABA quantification. Frequency-specific auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded at 4, 8, 16 and 32 kHz before and after exposure to examine hearing threshold (HT) shifts. Following imaging, brains were processed for fluorescence immunohistochemistry (FIHC) targeting Neuronal Nuclear Protein (NeuN), 4',6-diamidino-2-fenilindo (DAPI), Neurofilament (SMI312), vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and vesicular glutamate transporters 1 (VGLUT1) and 2 (VGLUT2).

Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), symptoms include headache, a range of cognitive deficits, and depression. Currently, there are no established treatments for PCS and no clear predictive biometrics to determine which patients are at increased risk. Previous studies have identified some protein-derived plasma biomarkers for mTBI, however, the effects of mTBI on lipid signaling molecules and metabolites in blood is largely unknown. Endogenous lipids (endolipids) such as the endocannabinoids (eCBs) and their congeners are lipid signaling molecules that are associated with promoting neuroprotective responses after head trauma in animal models. Here, we examine the plasma lipidome using a rat model of acute and repeated mTBI that we previously demonstrated had a sex dependent change in neuroinflammation wherein females showed a higher degree of neurodegeneration after repeated head-injury than males. Key results of this exploratory lipidomics screen here demonstrates that acute head injury drives significantly more changes in plasma endolipids in males (32%) than females (8%), whereas, on the second day of head injury, only 11% change in males but 15% in females. Some key endolipids were modified in both males are precursors for resolving molecules and this was lacking in females. Given that females with repeated mTBI in this model demonstrated aspects of PCS, this could be an important component in evaluating clinical cases. Endolipids in the screen were measurable in plasma using only 100 microL, a volume necessary to be able to perform multiple blood draws on these rodent subjects. This threshold provides evidence that the levels of these endolipids could be readily measured throughout patient recovery. Therefore, this family of endolipids has the potential to provide data on the progression of the injury and could be another crucial aspect in predicting mTBI outcomes.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

In this work, we investigated the neural dynamics of face pareidolia, testing the hypothesis that it emerges from a temporal cascade that integrates global (low spatial frequency, LSF) and local (high spatial frequency, HSF) visual information. With a pareidolia detection task, we combined event-related potentials (ERP), multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to map the evolving neural code for illusory face perception. Behaviorally, participants experienced pareidolia from both LSF and HSF stimuli, but the percept was strongest for broadband images containing both frequency bands. Electrophysiological results revealed a clear temporal progression. Early processing (<150 ms) was driven by low-level attributes, with distinct P100/N100 components and neural representations for LSF and HSF signals. A critical shift occurred around 145 ms, after which MVPA decoding could reliably distinguish between images perceived as faces and those that were not. Concurrently, RSA showed that the geometry of neural representations shifted to reflect participants' subjective face-likeness ratings, rather than the initial physical properties of the stimuli. This transition to a higher-order, subjective evaluation was marked by a later N250 component, whose amplitude indexed the cognitive load of integrating the visual cues.

While CIs effectively restore speech perception in quiet environments, sound localization remains challenging for bilateral CI users, particularly their ability to utilize interaural time differences (ITDs). The majority of clinical CI processors use a coding strategy that encodes ITD information only in the envelope of electrical pulse trains rather than their pulse timing, which may contribute to the poorer spatial hearing perception of CI users. We recently demonstrated in a behavioral study on early deafened, bilaterally CI-implanted rats that pulse timing ITDs completely dominate ITD perception, while sensitivity to envelope ITDs is almost negligible in comparison. Building on this, we here investigated the neurophysiological sensitivity of the inferior colliculus (IC) to envelope and pulse timing ITDs at two different pulse rates (900 and 4500 pulses/s) and three different stimulation modulations (5, 20 and 100 Hz) in CI rats with different hearing experiences. Our results indicate that IC neurons exhibit far greater sensitivity to pulse timing ITD than envelope ITD independent of pulse rate, modulation rate or hearing experience. These findings suggest that to improve binaural hearing outcome in bilateral CI users, clinical stimulation strategies should provide informative pulse timing ITDs.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

This study investigated the synergistic neuroprotective effects of combining NAC with non-contact high-frequency low-intensity pulsed electric field (H-LIPEF) stimulation on SH-SY5Y human neuronal cells subjected to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative damage. It was found that after SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with NAC and exposed to H-LIPEF stimulation, the oxidative stress of cells was reduced in the subsequent treatment with H2O2. The results showed that the combined NAC and H-LIPEF treatment significantly improved cell viability and better preserved cellular morphology compared to either treatment alone. Additionally, this combination treatment more effectively reduced mitochondrial apoptosis. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the combination substantially decreased levels of superoxide and intracellular H2O2, which was associated with enhanced activation of the p-Akt/Nrf2/SOD2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the treatment reduced the accumulation of 8-oxo-dG accumulation and elevated MTH1 expression, indicating a protective effect against oxidative DNA damage. These results suggest that H-LIPEF enhances the neuroprotective efficacy of low-dose NAC, highlighting the potential of this combination approach as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NDDs.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

While these microbial proteins restore light sensitivity, their clinical potential remains limited by low light sensitivity and immunogenicity risks. Recent efforts have focused on vertebrate opsins as safer alternatives, with mid-wavelength cone opsin (MW-opsin) demonstrating RGC depolarization via endogenous G-protein signaling. In this study, we reveal a surprising divergence in signaling outcomes of expressing short-wavelength mouse cone opsin (Opn1sw) in RGCs of blind mice. Using multielectrode array recordings and whole-cell patch clamping, we demonstrate that Opn1sw induces membrane hyperpolarization in RGCs - a stark contrast to MW-opsin's depolarizing effects. This unexpected inversion suggests differential engagement of intracellular signaling pathways, potentially stemming from distinct G-protein coupling preferences. Comparative analysis of native G-protein expression profiles in RGCs versus cone photoreceptors supports this hypothesis, revealing mismatches that may explain ectopic opsin behavior. Our findings challenge the assumption of conserved opsin signaling across spectral subtypes and cell types, highlighting critical gaps in understanding vertebrate opsin-G protein interactions in non-native cellular environments. This discovery points to the necessity of systematic characterization of opsin signaling networks in target retinal cells, a prerequisite for engineering optimized optogenetic tools that reliably produce desired electrophysiological outcomes.

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common monogenic form of familial SVD. CADASIL is caused by dominant missense mutations in Notch3, a receptor expressed in mural cells, including smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and pericytes. However, the cell-type specific contributions driving the CADASIL pathology remain unknown due to lack of animal models. Here, we generated two conditional knock-in mouse models carrying the CADASIL-causing Notch3R170C mutation selectively in SMC and brain pericytes. Both Notch3R170C models showed perivascular accumulation of the NOTCH3 extracellular domain, yet developed distinct neurovascular changes depending on the affected cell type. Pericyte-specific Notch3R170C mice displayed pronounced region-selective microglial activation and vascular changes, whereas SMC-specific Notch3R170C mice showed localized perivascular gliosis with minimal vascular remodeling. Proteomic profiling of isolated brain vessels revealed largely unique cell-specific responses. Pericytes Notch3R170C expression dysregulated metabolic pathways, whereas SMC Notch3R170C expression induced immune signaling related pathways. Integration with single-cell RNA-seq data revealed that many of the proteomic and phosphoproteomic shifts might also include brain endothelial cells, including metabolic changes in the presence of pericyte Notch3R170C and inflammatory signaling in the presence of SMC-Notch3R170C.

Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein CSDE1 as a key cofactor that promotes AGO2-dependent passenger-strand removal and miR-486-5p maturation. CSDE1 interacts with the N-terminal domain of AGO2, essential for strand release. Loss of CSDE1 increased the miR-486-3p/5p ratio, reduced cleavage efficiency, and derepressed miR-486 targets such as FOXO1 and PTEN. Restoring full-length CSDE1 expression restored AGO2-dependent passenger strand cleavage, and this function requires the N-terminal cold-shock domain CSD1, which mediates CSDE1 interaction with AGO2.

While the integrity of the egg-1 egg-2 eggshells are compromised and often rupture within the uterus, surprisingly, some embryos are capable of undergoing several rounds of cell division.

To identify proteins interacting with CKAP2, we immunoprecipitated endogenous CKAP2 together with interacting proteins from mitotic RPE1 cells and analysed the samples by mass spectrometry. This experiment identified the mitotic protein kinase Aurora Kinase A, together with its cofactor TPX2, as interacting proteins of CKAP2. Notably, CKAP2 co-localizes and interacts with Aurora Kinase A and TPX2 throughout mitosis, but not with the related protein Aurora Kinase B.

Aligning the circadian system with environmental time cues is therefore essential for maintaining physiological and psychological well-being. While luminotherapy and melatonin supplementation are widely used to facilitate circadian realignment, emerging evidence suggests that fluctuations in oxygen levels may also help in circadian realignment. However, the effect of hypoxia on the synchronisation of the circadian clock in humans remains largely unexplored. Methods Using a randomized controlled crossover study design, 11 healthy participants (6 men, 5 women, mean age 23.3 +/- 1.9 years) completed one baseline condition and two 48-h experimental conditions. The baseline condition (BL) was used to establish circadian markers. Both experimental conditions simulated a phase advance of 4 hours. In condition 1 (Hypo), participants underwent a 2-hour normobaric hypoxic exposure (FiO2 = 12%), starting 2 h after habitual wake time. In condition 2 (Lum+Mel), participants received a 3-hour luminotherapy session (500 nm, 506 lux) at the same time point, combined with 5 mg of exogenous melatonin administered 6 hours before usual bedtime. Salivary melatonin levels were measured in each phase of the study to assess circadian phase shifts. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. Results Salivary melatonin levels increased progressively over time in all conditions (p < 0.001), with significant differences observed between experimental conditions (p < 0.001), but no interaction effect (p = 0.854). Exposure to hypoxia significantly reduced oxyhemoglobin saturation (p < 0.05) and increased heart rate and subjective symptoms of fatigue. In terms of circadian phase, the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) occurred 1.30 hour (78 minutes) earlier in the Lum+Mel condition compared to baseline (p=0.001). In the hypoxia condition, the DLMO occurred on average 0.58 hour (34.8 minutes) earlier than baseline, but this change did not reach statistical significance (p=0.156). Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence that normobaric hypoxia may modestly advance the human circadian phase, although not to a statistically significant extent. In contrast, combined phototherapy and melatonin administration produced a robust and significant phase advance in salivary melatonin onset. These findings suggest that while hypoxia may influence circadian timing, established interventions like light and melatonin remain more effective for circadian realignment.

Nitrogen isotope values ({delta}15N) of bulk tissue may be used as indirect indicators of an organism's trophic level and the isotopic composition of its prey. In contrast, compound-specific isotope analysis can estimate trophic level directly. For the fishes of Chesapeake Bay, museum collections provide a unique opportunity to characterize trophic trends collected as early as the 1850s, from an ecosystem that has been overfished and subjected to increasingly high nutrient loading and land use change during the past three centuries. To assess isotope data for evidence of change in predator species trophic level, we analyzed tissue from 183 museum specimens of three predators (Striped Bass, Morone saxatilis; Summer Flounder, Paralichthys dentatus; and Bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix) and two lower-trophic-level species (Bay Anchovy, Anchoa mitchilli; and Menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus). Predatory Striped Bass did not show an increase through time in {delta}15N values, despite such a trend in Bay Anchovy, suggesting possible change in trophic level. Analysis of Striped Bass tissue using compound specific analysis indicates their mean trophic level has been stable for decades. These findings imply that Striped Bass are part of a diverse food web within Chesapeake Bay beyond that reflected by our two included prey species and are stable through time in their average size-specific trophic level, a valuable insight into their ecological role.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Beyond genetic adaptation, plastic responses to the environment can alter phenotypes and fitness, ultimately driving evolution. However, the interaction between plasticity and adaptation during environmental change is complex and hard to measure in natural systems. Here, we used two populations of Tigriopus californicus copepods, a thermally tolerant southern population and a thermally sensitive northern population, to conduct a fully factorial split brood experiment where we exposed animals as larvae and adults to either a sublethal heat stress or control (no heat treatment) before measuring heat tolerance and gene expression patterns. We found that increased thermal tolerance across populations came at the expense of physiological plasticity and evolved through higher baseline expression of heat stress response genes across environmental contexts as well as increased gene expression plasticity in response to heat stress. In the thermally sensitive northern population, developmental exposure to heat stress led to higher adult tolerance and lower physiological plasticity underpinned by higher gene expression plasticity. Importantly, we found that the same set of genes were largely responsible for both the evolved higher tolerance in the southern population and the developmentally induced tolerance in the northern population suggesting that in this system, a shared molecular response contributes to acclimation and adaptation across both populations. These results link existing physiological plasticity with long-term evolutionary responses providing insight into how these populations will adapt and respond to future environmental change.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Integrating high-resolution multi-omics with high-throughput functional profiling in patient-derived organoids offers a powerful strategy to further refine patient stratification. While (epi)genetic profiling has drastically improved the classification in diffuse adult gliomas, these advances have not yet translated into effective therapeutic interventions and precision medicine approaches remain to be established. Material and Methods: We investigated a panel of 48 patient-derived organoid and orthotopic xenograft models of adult high-grade gliomas, comprehensively characterized at genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic levels. A functional drug screen was performed on 27 organoid models using a 202-compound library targeting cancer-related pathways and epigenetic regulators. Unsupervised multi-omics factor analysis was employed to identify patient-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Validation included dose-dependent drug efficacy assessments, as well as biomarker assessment in patient tumors across molecular subgroups. Results: Multi-omics analysis revealed a broad spectrum of molecular profiles capturing the genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic diversity of high-grade gliomas. Multi-omics factor analysis, integrating multi-omics and drug response profiles, identified distinct subgroups associated with IDH1 mutation and MYCN amplification. IDH1 mutant grade 4 astrocytomas showed selective sensitivity to histone deacetylase 3 inhibitors, while a MYCN-amplified glioblastoma responded preferentially to histone methyltransferase inhibitors. The differential drug responses were linked to specific (epi)genetic and transcriptomic biomarkers. While other glioblastomas exhibited heterogeneous treatment responses, no robust biomarker-defined responder subgroups were identified. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the value of integrating multi-omics and functional profiling to inform precision medicine strategies. This approach enables the stratification of distinct patient subgroups in preclinical models, paving the way for tailored therapeutic interventions. While we observed distinct pharmacogenomic profiles in IDH1 mu-tant grade 4 astrocytomas and a MYCN-amplified glioblastoma, implementing precision medicine in other glioblastoma subtypes remains a substantial challenge.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

The growing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance further complicates treatment. A major contributor to the versatility of S. aureus is its broad repertoire of virulence factors, among which secreted proteases facilitate dissemination from colonization sites into deeper tissues. Twelve extracellular proteases are secreted, with the serine protease-like protein (Spl) family (SplA to SplF), encoded within a single operon, accounting for half of them. Despite this prominence, the pathophysiological roles and substrate specificities of the Spl proteases remain poorly understood. Here, we employed a direct protein protein interaction approach to identify novel SplB substrates in human serum. We demonstrate that SplB cleaves three intermediate filament proteins, namely desmin, vimentin, and nestin, as well as heat shock protein {beta}1 and -enolase, which have not previously been recognized as targets of S. aureus proteases. Moreover, SplB was found to cleave native IgG, a feature otherwise described only for the glutamyl endopeptidase V8. These findings expand the host protein repertoire targeted by SplB and suggest broader roles for Spl proteases in immune evasion and tissue invasion.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles responsible for the degradation of damaged or dysfunctional cellular components, including mitochondria. Their acidic internal environment and the presence of an array of hydrolytic enzymes facilitate the efficient breakdown of macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Mitochondria play a critical role in maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis to meet the energy demands under physiological and pathological conditions. Mitochondrial quality control within skeletal muscle during processes such as exercise, disuse, and injury is regulated by mitophagy, where dysfunctional mitochondria are targeted for lysosomal degradation. The limited understanding of quality control mechanisms in skeletal muscle necessitates the need for isolating intact lysosomes to assess organelle integrity and the degradative functions of hydrolytic enzymes. Although several methods exist for lysosome isolation, the complex structure of skeletal muscle makes it challenging to obtain relatively pure and functional lysosomes due to the high abundance of contractile proteins. Here we describe a method to isolate functional lysosomes from small amounts of mouse skeletal muscle tissue, preserving membrane integrity. We also describe functional assays that allow direct evaluation of lysosomal enzymatic activity and we provide data indicating reduced lysosomal degradative activity in lysosomes from aging muscle. We hope that this protocol provides a valuable tool to advance our understanding of lysosomal biology in skeletal muscle, supporting investigations into lysosome-related dysfunction in aging, disease, and exercise adaptations.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

However, a distinct subset known as adaptive NK (aNK) cells has been shown to acquire memory-like properties following viral infections, indicating their capacity for antigen-specific immune recall. Intriguingly, aNK cells have also been identified within the tumor microenvironment, where they can mediate tumor-specific recall responses. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms governing their function in tumor-infiltrating aNK cells remain largely undefined. In this study, we integrated publicly available multiomics datasets from ovarian cancer, including single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), to identify chromatin-accessible regions and construct transcription factors (TF)-gene regulatory networks. To validate and extend these findings, we performed Smart-seq3 on NK cells isolated from ovarian tumors and applied SCENIC analysis to identify TF-driven gene regulation. By integrating results from both analyses, we identified PRDM1 and STAT2 as key TFs, along with their downstream targets CRCP and MTFP1, specifically enriched in tumor-infiltrating aNK cells. The expression levels of CRCP and MTFP1 positively correlated with NK cell infiltration in ovarian cancer tissues, suggesting their potential functions in supporting tumor-specific NK cell memory responses.

This is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the process of follicle development. Previous work has demonstrated that group culture of primary murine follicles had a synergistic effect on growth and maturation in contrast to single follicles, but mechanisms remained unknown. Here, we cultured primary follicles in groups of 5 (5X) or 10 (10x) for twelve days, separated the somatic cells from oocytes, and analyzed the temporal transcriptional signatures every two days. In total, 13,461 genes in somatic cells and 10,091 genes in oocytes were computationally sorted into ten temporally distinct gene expression patterns. The somatic cell temporal gene expression patterns showed strong concordance with the granulosa and theca cell markers reported in a recent single-cell whole ovary RNA sequencing study. Importantly, canonical markers of steroidogenesis in cultured follicles followed expected trajectories of decreasing Amh expression and increasing Inhba, Inhbb, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Cyp19a1, Lhcgr, and Fshr over the culture period. Furthermore, when comparing the 10X and 5X culture groups, we identified 306 and 14 differentially expressed genes in somatic cells and oocytes, respectively. Shotgun proteomics data was aligned with the somatic cell transcriptomic data and identified four L-R pairs that were differentially expressed between the two conditions.

Yet its role in thyroid biology remains largely unexplored. In this study, we uncover a central function for KLHL14 in maintaining thyroid epithelial identity and regulating tissue homeostasis. Using a thyroid organoid model, we show that KLHL14 is essential for the proper growth and maturation of thyroid cells. Reduction of KLHL14 expression disrupts organoid development and triggers a dual cellular response involving features of both senescence and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These phenotypic changes are accompanied by increased cellular plasticity and migratory capacity. Mechanistically, we identify TGF-{beta} signaling as a key pathway activated upon KLHL14 depletion, contributing to the observed cellular reprogramming. Inhibiting TGF-{beta} restores growth and reduces markers of senescence and EMT, positioning KLHL14 as an upstream modulator of this signaling axis. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for KLHL14, suggesting that its dysfunction may contribute to disease progression in aggressive thyroid cancers.

Interestingly, CED-1 family members are also expressed in neurons, but their functions in these non-engulfing cells remain unclear. Our study shows that CED-1 localizes to the dendrites and primary cilia of male tail RnB neurons, which mediate sensory perceptions during mating and generate extracellular vesicles (EVs) that transfer bioactive macromolecules for both intercellular and animal-to-animal communication. Loss of ced-1 leads to a reduction in the shedding of EVs that contain the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel PKD-2 from the cilium distal tip, and this is rescued by the expression of CED-1 in the neurons. CED-1 is required to increase both the abundance of PKD-2 in the cilium and PKD-2 EV shedding in response to the physiological stimulus of mating partners. Assessment of ced-1 mutant male mating indicates that neuronal CED-1 is also important for turning behavior, which helps the male tail to maintain contact with a mate. Collectively, these results reveal a new role for CED-1 in neurons as a regulator of EV biogenesis in response to environmental cues, optimizing the shedding of bioactive EVs for effective communication.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

MAP65-1 preferentially binds bent microtubules both in vitro and in cells, likely because bending induces lattice damage, enhancing nucleation on and bundling of these microtubules in vitro. This creates a potential feedback loop where mechanical stress promotes MAP65-1 binding, which in turn stabilizes microtubules by nucleation and bundling and reinforces the alignment of the array with mechanical stress. Thus, we reveal a previously unknown role for MAP65/PRC1 proteins in lattice-based nucleation and suggest a mechanism by which cells record and respond to mechanical stress through microtubule reorganization.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

This asymmetric centromere positioning is regulated through microtubules, originating from the apical centrosome that connect to apical nuclear pore complexes. The minus-end directed motor protein Dynein, its binding partner Mushroom body defect, and Lamin are also required. Asymmetric centromere positioning persists throughout interphase in neural stem cells but is lost in more differentiated progeny.

Disruption in ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) can cause severe ribosomopathies, underscoring the critical need for precise regulatory mechanisms governing RiBi. In this study, we identified the gene NudC (nuclear distribution C, dynein complex regulator), a previously unrecognized regulator of RiBi in polyploid cells of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. RNAi-mediated depletion of NudC in polyploid salivary gland cells led to a significant reduction in ribosome abundance, accompanied by the loss of ribosome-binding sites on rough endoplasmic reticulum and impaired translation. These defects are linked to decreased levels of nucleolar ribosomal RNA. Notably, NudC knockdown also triggered a homeostatic response, characterized by increased transcription and translation of both ribosome biogenesis factors (RBFs) and ribosomal proteins. This response parallels that seen in RBF-deficient cells, suggesting that NudC and RBFs cooperate to maintain RiBi homeostasis. Meanwhile, NudC-deficient cells exhibited chromosome abnormalities, activated JNK signaling, and underwent autophagy, closely resembling the defects observed upon loss of RBFs. Finally, our findings suggest that the role of NudC in RiBi is independent of its established function in dynein regulation, indicating the moonlighting role in RiBi played by this gene. Together, these results uncover a new, fundamental function for NudC in maintaining RiBi and homeostasis in polyploid cells, with broader implications for understanding conserved mechanisms of NudC function and RiBi across species.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Here we developed clamp-free, highly stable soluble S trimers by truncating the stem helix to maximize yield and covalently linking the 3 monomers via engineered disulfides to increase thermostability. In K18hACE2 mice, covalently linked SARS CoV-2 S trimers elicited >10-fold higher neutralizing antibody (NAb) titres than parental unlinked trimers and protected the mice against viral challenge. A trivalent vaccine formulation comprised of covalently stabilized spikes derived from 3 divergent ACE2-using Sarbecovirus clades elicited broad and potent neutralizing activity in mice.

Using long-read sequencing and transcriptomics, we identify full-length, transcriptionally active giant viruses integrated within the host genome. Reactivation of these elements is specific to reproductive cells, transforming gametangia into virus-producing structures, and viral symptoms strictly correlate to the presence of active EVEs. Genetic analyses show that these elements are stably inherited, while their activation is precisely regulated by developmental and environmental cues. By resolving the genomic integration sites, we propose a mechanism for Phaeovirus integration and replication.

Results: Here, we analyzed public gene expression data of blood leukocytes, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and lung tissues from uninfected healthy humans and those infected with the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We found that PDLIM2 expression was repressed by viral infection, and notably, this repression correlated with the severity of infectious diseases. Consistently, the expression level of PDLIM2 was negatively associated with NF-kB and STAT3 activity across a diverse range of cell types, such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, T cells, alveolar type 1 and 2 epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. Accordingly, cells with low PDLIM2 expression exhibited aberrant activation of signaling pathways essential for cellular functions and immune responses.

However, it is not fully understood how C. glabrata responds to macrophage engulfment, and it is unknown how this presumably DNA-damaging environment influences pathogen genome stability. In this study, we used comparative transcriptomics to identify amino acid starvation and DNA damage as conditions eliciting C. glabrata responses most similar to macrophage engulfment. Consistent with this, we found that C. glabrata intra-macrophage survival and replication require master regulator of amino acid biosynthesis GCN4 and functional DNA double-strand break repair. Furthermore, comet assays provided the first direct evidence for increased DNA breaks in intra-macrophage yeast, and pulse-field gel electrophoresis showed that chromosomal alterations occur frequently in macrophage-passaged C. glabrata. Interestingly, these alterations could not be resolved by long read DNA sequencing, suggesting that they involved highly complex repetitive regions. Finally, we identified several point mutations emerging during macrophage passaging and showed that among them, a frameshift in RME1 (repressor of meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), increased C. glabrata intra-macrophage fitness.

M.; Li, H.; Chen, B. K.", "abstract": "Antibodies inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by targeting the envelope glycoprotein (Env). Env cleavage is a key determinant of antibody binding, as cleavage reduces Env flexibility and alters glycosylation. Given the greater abundance of uncleaved Env on the cell surface compared to virions, we investigated whether Env endocytosis, initiated through a membrane-proximal tyrosine motif in its cytoplasmic tail, regulates the abundance of cleaved Env at the cell surface. We hypothesize that such a shift would alter the cleavage and glycosylation profile of cell surface Env, affecting the sensitivity of cell-to-cell infection to neutralizing antibodies. To address this, we generated an endocytic mutant (ASPI-Env) and compared its antigenic properties to a cleavage-site mutant (SEKS-Env). Immunoprecipitation and ratiometric antibody binding studies of cell surface Env demonstrated that the ASPI mutation increases the amount of uncleaved Env on the cell surface. Consequently, ASPI-Env in cell-free infection was more sensitive to NAbs recognizing uncleaved Env. Notably, only b12, which can engage both cleaved and uncleaved Env but has a higher affinity for uncleaved Env, showed increased inhibition of ASPI-Env during cell-to-cell infection. This mirrors the enhanced neutralization of SEKS-Env during the cell-to-cell transfer assay and supports a model in which uncleaved Env participates in CD4-dependent virion transfer. Finally, the ASPI mutation altered lectin binding and differentially affected cell-to-cell and cell-free infections.

There, Mtb encounters an antimicrobial pulmonary alveolar lining fluid (ALF) before it is engulfed by macrophages. To study the genes involved in the ability of Mtb to survive the transition from desiccated droplet to pulmonary alveolus in an in vitro model, we formulated a model alveolar lining fluid (MALF) that mimics the composition of ALF as inferred from human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). We compared the transcriptome of log-phase Mtb in MALF to the transcriptome of Mtb in BALF as BALF from the lungs of healthy adults was reconstituted to compensate for the dilution of ALF by lavage (rcBALF). Mtb from log-phase culture in a standard laboratory medium survived quantitatively in MALF and rcBALF for at least 24 hours. In contrast, Mtb that had passed through earlier stages of transmission began to succumb after 3 hours in MALF, past the time when particles have been observed to be phagocytized by alveolar macrophages. Screening of a genome-wide CRISPRi library of Mtb identified 35 genes as uniquely required by Mtb to survive the transition from desiccated microdroplet into rehydration in MALF. Thirty-one of these genes are non-essential under conventional laboratory conditions and seven have unknown functions. Thirteen of the 35 genes were additionally required for Mtb to survive in macrophage-like cells cultured at the air-liquid interface with pulmonary epithelial cells. This study nominates additional members of the transmission survival genome of Mtb, illustrates that different genes may contribute to the survival of Mtb at different stages of transmission, and suggests that modeled transmission can shed light on the functions of Mtb genes whose contributions have been unknown.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Pseudolysogeny, where a phage genome persists in a non-integrated, latent state within the host, has been largely overlooked due to concerns about therapeutic efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that pseudolysogeny in Cutibacterium acnes confers superinfection resistance but imposes substantial fitness costs, including reduced biofilm formation, impaired interspecies competitiveness, and reversal of antibiotic resistance. Pseudolysogenic phages were also capable of killing starved C. acnes cells through direct lytic replication. No evidence of transduction of clindamycin resistance by these phages was detected. In a 3-month proof-of-concept study, topical application of a pseudolysogenic phage significantly reduced C. acnes abundance, acne lesions, and inflammation, with no adverse effects and persistence of viable phages post-treatment. Importantly, no phage-resistant C. acnes clones were detected during the in vivo study, likely due to the evolutionary trade-offs associated with pseudolysogeny that diminish the bacterial ecological fitness. These findings highlight pseudolysogeny as a mechanism that can be leveraged to enhance phage therapy outcomes while maintaining microbiome stability and limiting antibiotic resistance evolution.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

K.; Gerlach, R.; Narwani, A.", "abstract": "Microalgae hold the potential to supply sustainable food, fuel, plastics, and chemicals at commercial scales. Cultivating microalgae at extreme pH (>10) and high alkalinity provides multiple benefits including 1) reducing the risk of contamination by undesired organisms and 2) enabling direct air capture of CO2, which expands the land area suitable for algae farming compared to using CO2 point sources alone. However, we currently have a limited understanding of which algal taxa can grow under these conditions. Therefore, we conducted a high-throughput screening of 49 freshwater microalgae strains, comprising 40 species, for their ability to grow in moderate (pH 8.5, 25 mM alkalinity), high (pH 10, 75 mM alkalinity), and extreme (pH 10, 150 mM alkalinity) cultivation environments. Our results show that moderate alkalinity tends to significantly increase algae growth (including potentially harmful strains). However, higher levels inhibit all but a small subset of green algae and cyanobacteria. Effects of salinity and alkalinity differed, indicating they are broadly decoupled. Our results identify new industrially relevant alkaline-tolerant strains, show that algae isolated from 'normal' ecosystems can be extremophilic, and suggest that future bioprospecting efforts for alkaline-tolerant algae adapted to local climatic conditions could yield additional productivity gains for the algae industry.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed a triple-fluorescent color recombination assay to identify homology mediated and non-canonical recombination events between co-infecting HSV-1 strains. We developed a deep learning model that detects and classifies progeny plaques according to their colors. This setup enabled us to perturb the infection process using small molecule inhibitors targeting either viral or host proteins. We identified that inhibitors that reduce infectious viral progeny, increased viral homology mediated recombination.

S.; Kiran, G. S.; Voulvoulis, N.; Selvin, J.; Sriskandan, S.", "abstract": "Background. The global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is driven by multiple factors, including inadequate sanitation and the suboptimal use of antibiotics in healthcare. The environment is recognised as an important and underappreciated reservoir for AMR. Pollutants can exert selective pressure that co-selects for resistant phenotypes, while faecal contamination introduces enteric bacteria capable of acquiring resistance elements that provide a survival advantage. Aims. This study aimed to characterize multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in sediment and water samples collected from an industrial site and an adjacent canal in 2023 and 2024. Selective agar plating was used to isolate MDR bacteria, which were subsequently subjected to whole-genome sequencing and analysed for the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), metal resistance genes (MRGs), and plasmid content. Results. Forty-two MDR isolates were retrieved and sequenced over two seasons. Most were Gram negative and most originated from the industrial location; no MDR bacteria were found in a control location. Species included both environmental and Enterobacteriaceae, indicative of faecal contamination by wastewater, Of the 40 bacteria that possessed at least one ARG, 87.5% (35/40) also carried at least one or more MRG. ARG identified on mobile genetic elements included CTXM-15, bla-NDM1, bla-VIM1, other carbapenemases, and 16sRMTases. MRG encoded resistance to copper, silver, tellurium, arsenic, and mercury, while plasmid assemblies showed evidence of genetic exchange within the environmental ecosystem. Levels of mercury, vanadium, zinc and copper in sediments exceeded international guideline values. Conclusion. Industrial locations harbour a spectrum of pollutants that contribute to the development and spread of AMR. In this case study, heavy metals appear to act as a potentially major selective pressure driving the evolution of multidrug resistance through co-selection. The observed diversity of mobilizable ARGs and MRGs in the environment highlights the potential for such toxic environments to serve as incubators for the emergence of novel, high-risk bacterial clones", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

It is characterised by the asymmetric distribution of lipids and proteins in the cell membrane and cortex, and organelles in the cell. Cell polarisation drives essential processes such as morphogenesis, cell migration, asymmetric cell division, directional transport of molecules across epithelium, nerve impulse transmission etc. Although, the importance of polarity proteins such as atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and Lgl2 (lethal giant larvae 2) has been relatively well understood in the developing zebrafish epidermis, whether basal lamina components are important for polarity maintenance has remained unclear. I analysed the role of Laminin5 (basal lamina component) in the establishment and maintenance of apicobasal polarity, in developing bi-layered zebrafish epidermis. I found that the loss of laminin 5 function results in reduced E-cadherin localization and increased cell spreading along with dynamic cell boundaries and increased cell proliferation indicating acquisition of mesenchymal traits. A similar phenotype was observed in integrin 6b mutant, which did not exacerbate in the double mutant embryos indicating that laminin 5 and integrin 6b function in the same pathway. Interestingly, periderm, the cell layer above basal epidermis, maintains its apicobasal polarity and epithelial integrity presumably via reinforcing the localization of aPKC and Lgl.

Thus, understanding organism's ecological role and exposure route to contaminants is central to assessing pollution impact. Treated municipal wastewater releases contaminants into waterways and alters microbial communities. Plants absorb contaminants and expose animals through foraging and nest-building activities. Nesting ecology differences of ground vs wood cavity-nesting bees offers insight into niche-specific susceptibility to pollution. Because contaminants bind to soil strongly, ground-nesting bees near wastewater are likely most impacted, while wood cavity-nesting bees likely less impacted since plants' ability to uptake contaminants are species dependent. We compared gut microbiomes of directly exposed soil-nesting Halictus ligatus and indirectly exposed wood-nesting Ceratina spp. upstream/downstream of wastewater. We collected bees, flowers, and soil, and analyzed their bacteria microbiomes (16S rRNA). Wastewater altered ground-nesting H. ligatus microbiome >18 times greater than wood cavity-nesting Ceratina adults. Ceratina larvae and pollen provisions showed significant but smaller shifts. Conversely, soil and flower microbiomes remained stable, indicating higher resilience. These results demonstrate that exposure routes drive contaminants susceptibility, with animal-associated microbes most vulnerable. Because bees are important pollinators and biodiversity contributors, these disruptions point to broader ecological risks in increasingly contaminated landscapes.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

The Hawaiian crickets of the genus Laupala represent a rapid non-adaptive radiation in which species are morphologically indistinguishable but differ in acoustic mating signals. Here we report the first discovery of natural hybridization in the Laupala radiation. During field surveys on Maui, we observed crickets with intermediate pulse rates and unusually high acoustic variation at sites where the ranges of Laupala makaio (slow singer) and Laupala orientalis (fast singer) converge. We hypothesized these represented natural hybrids and tested this prediction using genomic data from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis showed that fast-singing putative hybrids clustered with L. orientalis and the slow-singing ones with L. makaio, yet all putative hybrids formed a cohesive geographic group. Using 9,345 ancestry-informative markers, we calculated hybrid indices and heterozygosity values for triangle plot analysis. All hybrids showed excess L. makaio ancestry (predicted from analysis of pulse rate patterns) and were classified as later-generation hybrids or backcrosses to L. makaio, with no F1 hybrids detected. Critically, we found a strong positive correlation (R = +0.74, p < 0.001) between pulse rate and hybrid index at the site with highest pulse rate variation, showing that genomic ancestry predicts pulse rate phenotype. Morphological comparisons confirmed that hybrids were cryptic, reinforcing the difficulty of detecting hybridization without genomic data. Together, our results provide the first demonstration of natural hybridization in Laupala, showing that phenotypic predictions based on acoustic intermediacy can be confirmed with genomic evidence. The discovery of natural hybridization in Laupala opens new avenues for investigating how hybridization contributes to rapid diversification in non-adaptive radiations, paralleling patterns observed in some adaptive radiations.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Bacterial genome analysis tools and high-quality sequences with metadata are publicly available, but these resources remain underleveraged for examining historical data, especially when studying the spread of MGEs across a species and over time. Using publicly available reads and metadata, we explored the evolution of pT181 over almost seven decades of samples to identify temporal trends in sequence evolution, copy number changes, and spread across S. aureus and beyond. pT181 was prevalent across S. aureus (found in 9.5% of 83,366 genomes tested), with a conserved sequence outside of three hypervariable regions. The history of pT181 since 1954 is characterized by spread across strains, significant variation in plasmid copy number of the independent replicon, and increasing frequency of integration of the plasmid into the S. aureus chromosome. We have identified multiple chromosomal integration locations of the plasmid, including outside of the previously characterized SCCmec. We find that pT181 has been transferred across staphylococcaceae and into Gram-negative species. The repeated integration of pT181 into the chromosome may indicate co-evolution of the plasmid and the host, potentially to facilitate increased antibiotic resistance.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Accurate phasing and assembly in repetitive regions of the genome remain challenging, however. Addressing this obstacle is crucial for studying structural genomic variation such as copy number variations (CNVs) common to repetitive regions. Polar fishes, for example, evolved repetitive tandem arrays of antifreeze protein (AFP) genes that facilitated adaptation to freezing and expanded in copy number in colder environments. AFP CNVs remain poorly characterized in polar fishes and may be illuminated by haplotype-aware approaches. We performed long-read sequencing of two polar fishes in the suborder Zoarcoidei and leveraged published long-read data to assemble phased genomes. We developed a workflow to measure haplotype diversity in CNV while controlling for misassembly and switch errors - a change from one parental haplotype to another in a contiguous assembly. We present gfa_parser, which computes and extracts all possible contiguous sequences for phased or primary assemblies from graphical fragment assembly files, and switch_error_screen, which flags potential switch errors. gfa_parser revealed that assembly uncertainty was ubiquitous across AFP array haplotypes and that standard processing of graphical fragment assemblies can bias measurement of haplotype CNVs. We detected no switch errors in AFP arrays. After controlling for misassembly and switch error, we detected haplotype diversity of AFP CNVs in all studied polar Zoarcoidei species and in 60% of AFP arrays. Intraindividual haplotype diversity spanned differences of 3-16 copies.

We recently identified a P1-like P-P carrying the blaCTX-M-15 resistance gene in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, prompting a subsequent investigation into the overall frequency of P-Ps among gastrointestinal bacteria under routine genomic surveillance within England. We expanded our study to include P-P groups known to be associated with Enterobacteriaceae (P1, D6, SSU5, N15) and scanned a collection of 66,856 genomes of diarrhoeagenic Escherichia spp., Shigella spp. and S. enterica. All four P-P groups were detected in our dataset, totalling 9% of E. coli and Shigella genomes and 2% of S. enterica genomes. A small subset harboured two distinct P-P groups. P1-like P-Ps, some of which carried a cytotoxic necrotising factor, were predominantly associated with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli strains of public health concern, including clonal complexes CC11 (O157:H7), CC29 (O26:H11) and CC165. In contrast, SSU5 group P-Ps were linked with multidrug-resistant lineages of both S. Typhi and Shigella sonnei. We found multiple antimicrobial resistance genes inserted into P-Ps via transposons, integrons and insertion sequences, and numerous defence/anti-defence systems. There was evidence of vertical transmission but also many links across species, time and geography, indicating that horizontal transfer is occurring regularly. Phage-plasmids are often described only as cryptic elements or not detected during genomic surveillance.

Here, we leverage this one-to-one system to systematically characterize how the phage-bacteria arms race shapes C. acnes evolution and community composition on individual people. Our analysis reveals a surprising lack of phage-mediated selection despite global prevalence of C. acnes phages. Analysis of anti-phage defense systems across 3,205 bacterial genomes revealed a limited, phylogenetically restricted defense repertoire under weak selective pressure to diversify or be maintained. Functional assays did not reveal alternative phage resistance mechanisms or fitness costs associated with defense gene carriage that could explain this limited immune arsenal. This lack of pressure to maintain phage resistance could not be explained by lack of phage colonization, as examination of 471 global human facial skin metagenomes demonstrated that even in samples with high virus-to-microbe ratio, phage-sensitive clades dominate on-person populations. Together, these findings indicate that phage pressure, while present, does not play a critical role in determining strain fitness and success within C. acnes populations on human skin. We propose that this observed weak phage-mediated selective pressure can be explained by the anatomy of skin: C. acnes growth is thought to occur at the bottom of pores, where exposure to phage may be limited by physical barriers.

Due to its heterogeneous nature, diverse etiology, and the limited efficacy of current treatments, developing a therapeutic approach that can address the multifaceted aspects of the disease is imperative. Combinatorial therapy has emerged as a promising strategy for addressing tumor heterogeneity and the limitations of current treatments across various cancer types. In our study, we investigated the potential of combining NCX 4040, a nitric oxide-releasing aspirin derivative, and Napabucasin, a STAT3 and cancer stemness inhibitor, as a novel PCa treatment strategy. We utilized two cellular models: BPH-Cd, a cadmium-transformed carcinogenic cell line, and DU145, a brain metastatic PCa cell line. Our findings demonstrate that the combination treatment exerted a synergistic and dose-dependent reduction in cell viability, tumorigenicity, and migratory capabilities in both BPH-Cd and DU145 cells, surpassing the effects observed with individual treatments. Furthermore, this combination treatment triggered a robust generation of cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in G2/M cell cycle arrest and late-stage apoptosis in both cell lines. Additionally, the combination treatment downregulated redox-sensitive transcription factors pSTAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727, as well as pro-survival proteins TRX1/2, TRXR1, and GPX4, while upregulating tumor suppressor proteins PRDX1 and TXNIP. This implies that inhibition of the pro-survival redox proteins leads to the accumulation of oxidized PRDX1 and TXNIP, thereby elevating oxidative stress and blocking STAT3-mediated transcription, ultimately impeding cell proliferation and survival. Moreover, increased expression of pH2AX protein, a DNA damage marker, indicated that the combination induced DNA damage, resulting in the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, an anti-tumor immunogenic mechanism as confirmed with immunoblotting. Downregulation of various stem cell markers linked to Wnt/{beta}-catenin and Notch-1 signaling pathways highlight the combination's ability to also target cancer stemness. In summary, our study underscores the promise of combining NCX 4040 and Napabucasin as an innovative and multifaceted therapeutic approach for PCa.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Disruptions in this balance contribute to metabolic disorders, including Metabolic dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). Here, we identify a novel biological pathway downstream of glucagon that promotes the hepatic lipid accumulation associated with fasting. Using gain- and loss-of-function in vivo and in vitro models, we found that glucagon induces sustained expression of PGC-14, promoting lipid uptake and storage in hepatocytes by increasing PPAR{gamma} activity. Increased PPAR{gamma}/PGC-14 promotes hepatic Fsp27/Cidec expression, leading to lipid droplet expansion and triglyceride trapping in liver. Activity of the PPARGC1A alternative promoter and PGC-14 expression were higher in livers of patients with MASLD, and PGC-14 expression correlated with macrosteatosis. Consistently, persistent expression of hepatic PGC-14 in mice fed a western diet promoted macrosteatosis, exacerbated oxidative stress and altered hepatic lipid composition to resemble worsening Metabolic dysfunction Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) in humans. Our findings demonstrate that glucagon-induced hepatic PGC-14/PPAR{gamma} activity facilitates efficient uptake and storage of lipids during fasting, but over-activation of this coordinated metabolic pathway leads to lipid accumulation and worsening of steatosis in MASLD.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Yeast has been an invaluable model for elucidating the functions of P-bodies under laboratory conditions. However, the physiological significance of P-bodies in natural environments remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that P-body formation is required for yeast proliferation in the phyllosphere, the aerial parts of plants. Deletion of EDC3, a gene critical for P-body formation, impaired proliferation of the methanol-utilizing yeast Candida boidinii on Arabidopsis thaliana leaves where the yeast assimilates methanol as the carbon source while adapting to changes in environmental conditions. In vitro experiments showed that P-bodies contribute to the spatiotemporal regulation of methanol-induced mRNAs (mimRNAs). These mimRNAs form cytosolic dot structures (termed mimRNA granules) that harbor multiple kinds of mimRNAs. In the edc3{Delta} strain, the formation of mimRNA granules was reduced along with a decrease in mimRNA abundance. Under oxidative stress, colocalization of P-bodies with mimRNA granules markedly increased and growth of the edc3{Delta} strain on methanol was suppressed, suggesting active sequestration of mimRNAs within P-bodies as a stress tolerance response. Time-lapse microscopy revealed dynamic interactions between P-bodies and mimRNAs granules with transient colocalization. Together, our findings indicate that P-bodies function as temporal storage sites where mimRNAs are protected from degradation in the phyllosphere.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

The alternative archaeal system comprises Cdv proteins and is thought to bear some resemblance to ESCRT-III-based membrane remodelling in other domains of life, including eukaryotes, especially during abscission. Here we present biochemical, crystallographic and cryo-EM studies of the Sulfolobus Cdv machinery. CdvA, an early non-ESCRT component, adopts a PRC-domain/coiled-coil fold and polymerises into long double-stranded helical filaments, mainly via hydrophobic interfaces. Monomeric CdvB adopts the canonical ESCRT-III fold in both a closed and a distinct \"semi-open\" conformation. Soluble CdvB2 filaments are composed of subunits in the closed state, appearing to transition to the open, active state only when polymerised on membranes. Short N-terminal amphipathic helices in all CdvB paralogues, B, B1 and B2, mediate membrane binding and are required for liposome recruitment in vitro. We provide a molecular overview of archaeal ESCRT-III-based cytokinesis machinery, the definitive demonstration that CdvB proteins are bona fide ESCRT-III homologues and we reveal the molecular basis for membrane engagement.

The molecular landscape of cellular senescence has been met with conflicting findings, likely due to contamination of senescent cells by neighbouring proliferating cells. Here, we developed a genetically encoded and tractable system to purify senescent cells in culture termed \"SenLect\" (Senescence seLection). SenLect is a genetic cassette that expresses mCherry-2A-PuroR under the control of the miR-146a senescence-activated promoter, which provides senescent cells with a selective advantage over proliferating cells in the presence of the antibiotic puromycin. We validated this one-step system in primary HUVECs and HeLa cervical cancer cells to purify live senescent cells following DNA damage (UV irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, and doxorubicin) and cell-cycle inhibition (palbociclib). Puromycin-selected cells were enriched for various senescence-related phenotypes, including cell cycle arrest, increased cell size, and lysosomal {beta}-galactosidase activity. By using SenLect to remove proliferating cells, we uncovered how the proteome is rewired during senescence induced by palbociclib. This improved the detection of protein signatures linked to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and metabolic shifts from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, and from nucleotide synthesis to catabolism. It also revealed sub-proteome level rewiring of organelles such as mitochondria, lysosomes and the nucleolus, as well as protein cohorts like kinases and core-essential proteins.

Toyon's habitat faces changing wildfire regimes, widening variation in annual rainfall, and competition by invasive introduced species. We used a new modeling pipeline, temporal analysis of reproduction distributed in space (TARDIS) to examine how recent climate trends have shaped habitat suitability for toyon. Methods: As input data for TARDIS, we annotated flowering and fruiting in images from 4,105 observations of toyon contributed to the iNaturalist crowdsourcing platform. From these records we trained Bayesian additive regression tree models relating weather to toyon flowering intensity. We used a trained model to hindcast flowering each year back to 1900, and examined trends in hindcast flowering. For comparison, we also modeled changing habitat suitability using a conventional species distribution model (SDM) relating toyon presence to 30-year climate averages. Key results: Toyon flowering is associated with greater winter precipitation and warmer fall and winter temperatures. Our hindcast predicts that mean flowering intensity has been stable to slightly increasing since 1900, with greater increases in intensity at higher elevations, but also at lower latitudes. Annual variation in flowering intensity has also increased, especially at lower latitudes. Hindcast trends in flowering are positively correlated with changes in SDM-predicted suitability. Conclusions: TARDIS recovers biologically realistic predictors of toyon flowering, and hindcast changes in flowering intensity indicate the species' range remains suitable after 125 years of changing climate. Overall our results indicate toyon populations remain healthy, but may have limited opportunity to migrate northwards as climate change continues.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

L.; Akala, H. M.; Oyier, L. I. O.", "abstract": "Background Historically, chloroquine resistance emerged that was driven by mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene. This led to the global withdrawal of chloroquine in 1998 and its subsequent replacement with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, whose efficacy was compromised by a high prevalence of mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase and the dihydropteroate synthase genes by 2004. Consequently, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) were introduced in 2006. Since then, thirteen mutations in the kelch 13 (Pfk13) propeller domain have emerged and validated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as markers of partial artemisinin resistance. This study aimed to characterize temporal trends in both established, Pfcrt and Pfk13 and less well-described potential markers, cysteine desulfurase (Pfnfs) and Pfcoronin, using febrile malaria samples collected across diverse regions of Kenya between 2013 and 2022. Methods The temporal trend of these markers of resistance were assessed by screening archived P. falciparum positive dried blood spots (DBS). A total of 1,750 DBS samples collected from Therapeutic Efficacy Studies (TES) conducted in: Kwale (2013, n=350), Kisumu (2015, n=314), Busia (2016, n=334), Kisii (2017, n=314), Kwale (2018, n=150), and a hrp2 study conducted Kisii (2022, n=288). Parasite genomic DNA was extracted using the Chelex-saponin method and confirmed by a Pf 18S RT-PCR. Pfk13, Pfcrt, Pfnfs and Pfcoronin PCR amplicons were sequenced using capillary electrophoresis, Illumina Miseq or the Oxford Nanopore (GridION) platform. Results The prevalence of Pfcrt mutations declined over time and no WHO validated Pfk13 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance were detected. However, synonymous substitutions at WHO-validated codons C469C and P553P were identified. In the PfCoronin gene, non-synonymous mutations distinct from those reported in West Africa were observed at high frequencies (>75%). Notably, the Pfnfs-K65Q mutation, previously associated with reduced lumefantrine sensitivity in West Africa, was detected in over 80% of samples. Our findings reveal differences in some antimalarial resistance genetic markers between observations made in The Gambia and Senegal (West Africa) and Kilifi (East Africa). Based on the convenient sample set, there were no WHO validated k13 mutations up until 2022, suggesting continued ACT efficacy in Kenya. This study underscores the importance of continued molecular surveillance and suggests that resistance may evolve through different pathways in East compared to West Africa and Southeast Asia.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

In this study, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations to elucidate the chemo-mechanical coupling mechanism of dynamin membrane constriction. We set up a CG Martini simulation system that contains dynamin rings on a tubular membrane with realistic molecular structures. Controlling the length of the tubular membrane with a pressure coupling, we simulate membrane constriction through the nucleotide-state-dependent conformational change of dynamin. The simulation results suggest that the conformational change to the GDP state loosens and expands the dynamin rings, resulting in membrane constriction in the protein-uncoated region.

For allogeneic applications, multiplex editing is frequently required to improve efficacy, persistence, and safety. However, strategies involving multiple DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induce genotoxicity by provoking chromosomal aberrations. Base editors, which enable sequence changes without generating DSBs, are widely used for gene disruption, but their capacity for gene insertion remains unexplored. Here, we developed Base editor-mediated knock-in (BEKI), a non-viral platform that allows targeted transgene insertion in parallel with multiplex gene disruption using a single base editor. This is achieved by repurposing the Cas9 nickase domain of base editors to generate paired nicks that induce homology-directed repair (HDR). In human T cells, optimized guide RNA orientation and nick distance, together with HDR-enhancing modulators, enabled efficient transgene knock-in at the TRAC, CD3Z, B2M, and CD3E loci. Simultaneous base editing of multiple additional genes produced chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with increased cytokine secretion, drug resistance, and resistance to allo-rejection. Compared to multiplex editing with Cas9, BEKI markedly reduced chromosomal translocations. BEKI therefore provides a streamlined, scalable strategy for multiplex CAR T-cell engineering with a single enzyme, offering a safer route to clinical-grade manufacturing of off-the-shelf therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

These subunits assemble with a precise stoichiometry and arrangement, such that two distinct agonist-binding sites are formed at interfaces between a principle -subunit and a complementary {delta} or {epsilon}/{gamma}-subunit. Chemical differences between the two complementary subunits are presumed to confer functional inequivalence to the two agonist sites. This interpretation, however, neglects the asymmetric architecture of the acetylcholine receptor, which places each subunit, and therefore each agonist site, at unique positions within the heteropentamer. The extent to which functional inequivalence of the agonist sites stems from this structural asymmetry, as opposed to chemical differences, remains unexplored. Here, we reconstruct an ancestral subunit capable of substituting for both complementary subunits, thereby engineering hybrid ancestral/human acetylcholine receptors with chemically identical agonist sites. Despite being chemically identical, these agonist sites remain functionally inequivalent. Leveraging a human disease-causing mutation, we reveal that functional inequivalence stems from distinct intersubunit interactions, rather than chemical differences alone. This insight challenges the conventional understanding that chemical differences are the primary cause of agonist site functional inequivalence. Instead, our findings highlight the importance of the heteropentameric architecture in predisposing the agonist sites for functional inequivalence, offering new perspectives on acetylcholine receptor structure, function, and evolution.", "date": "2025-09-15", "journal": ""}

Using human fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mice, this study investigated the role of gut microbiome in metabolic changes related to SCZ and antipsychotic (olanzapine) treatment. Methods: 5-6 weeks old germ-free NIH Swiss mice of both sexes received microbiota from either SCZ patients (SCZ-FMT) or healthy controls (HC-FMT) followed by a diet with or without olanzapine for six-weeks. Food intake and body weight were monitored weekly, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and open field test were performed. Serum glucose, and insulin were measured. Gut microbiome characterization and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) quantification were performed in the cecal samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Results: Olanzapine treatment decreased the locomotor activity in the open field test, irrespective of sex or microbiota. Female SCZ-FMT recipient mice exhibited insulin resistance compared to HC-FMT, irrespective of olanzapine treatment. Female SCZ-FMT mice showed significantly lower alpha-diversity compared to HC-FMT, whereas olanzapine treatment increased alpha-diversity. SCZ-FMT and olanzapine treatment differentially altered the microbial abundances and metabolic pathways in male and female mice. Interestingly, cecal SCFAs, mainly acetate levels, were significantly decreased in female SCZ-FMT mice compared to HC-FMT, while olanzapine treatment increased acetate levels in male mice. Both male and female SCZ-FMT mice showed elevated levels of isovaleric acid compared to HC-FMT.
