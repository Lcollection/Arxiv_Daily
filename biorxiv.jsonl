Models based on surface tensions at cell interfaces can predict 3D static cellular arrangements within aggregates. However, predicting the dynamics of such arrangements is challenging due to difficulties in measuring temporal changes in tensions. Here, we characterise the spatiotemporal changes in cellular tensions shaping the early nematode embryo using AFM, live microscopy, and tension inference. Using excoriated embryos, we validate a hybrid inference pipeline that calibrates relative inferred tensions temporally using cortical myosin enrichment and absolute tensions using AFM measurements. Applied to embryos within their native shell, we infer a spatiotemporal map of absolute tensions, revealing that ABa, ABp, and EMS compaction is driven by increased tension at free surfaces, while P2's initial exclusion is due to high tension at intercellular contacts. We uncover a direct and non-affine contribution of cadherins to cell-cell contact tension, comparable to cadherins' indirect contribution via actomyosin regulation.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used a hierarchical state-space model to analyze data from a 139 km line transects in mid-Sweden over 48 years. Adult numbers and breeding success were analyzed separately, and we included covariates on vole abundance, numbers of snow-free days in autumn and spring, and the last day of frost in May. We assessed long-term trends in the adult population and estimated the effects of breeding success and weather variation on short-term changes. The estimates of adult density did not show any trend for the period 1976 to 2023, and the dynamics were characterized as a stationary process with a strong direct negative density dependence. A number of possible mechanisms have been suggested for how a warmer climate affects willow ptarmigan population dynamics, but our results do not support the hypothesis that lack of snow in autumn and spring increases the vulnerability of willow ptarmigan to predation and leads to population decline. Breeding success is an important driver of changes in, but independent of, adult density. In addition to predation, we propose that climate conditions and emerging vegetation during egg formation and laying is important. We suggest that our results can be explained by a diverse predator assemblage that makes it difficult for the population to escape top-down control, resulting in short-term fluctuations at lower densities.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

This decline in performance is revealed in many kinds of tasks, from detection to recognition. A parsimonious hypothesis is that the representation of any visual feature is blurred (spatially averaged) by an amount that differs for each feature, but that in all cases increases with eccentricity. Here, we examine models for two such features: local luminance and spectral energy. Each model averages the corresponding feature in pooling windows whose diameters scale linearly with eccentricity. We performed perceptual experiments with synthetic stimuli to determine the largest window scaling for which human and model discrimination abilities match (the \"critical\" scaling). We used much larger stimuli than those of previous studies, subtending 53.6 by 42.2 degrees of visual angle. We found that the critical scaling for the luminance model was approximately one-fourth that of the energy model and, consistent with earlier studies, that the estimated critical scaling value was smaller when discriminating a synthesized stimulus from a natural image than when discriminating two synthesized stimuli. Moreover, we found that initializing the generation of the synthesized images with natural images reduced the critical scaling value when discriminating two synthesized stimuli, but not when discriminating a synthesized from a natural image stimulus. Together, the results show that critical scaling is strongly affected by the image statistic (pooled luminance vs. spectral energy), the comparison type (synthesized vs. synthesized or synthesized vs. natural), and the initialization image for synthesis (white noise vs natural image). We offer a coherent explanation for these results in terms of alignments and misalignments of the models with human perceptual representations.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Resurgence can result from pesticide-enhanced pest reproduction, however, the molecular mechanisms mediating this process remain unresolved. Here we show that brown planthopper (BPH) resurgence in rice crops following exposure to sublethal doses of the pesticide emamectin benzoate (EB) results from the coordinated action of a suite of genes that regulate juvenile hormone (JH) levels, resulting in increased JH titer in adult females and enhanced fecundity. We demonstrate that EB treatment at sublethal levels results in profound changes in female BPH fitness including increased egg maturation and oviposition. This enhanced reproductive fitness results from the EB-mediated upregulation of key genes involved in the regulation of JH, including JHAMT and Kr-h1 and the downregulation of allatostatin (AstA) and allatostatin receptor (AstAR) expression. AstA signaling is known to inhibit the production of JH in the corpora allata and hence EB exposure diminishes this inhibitory action. We find that the changes in gene expression following EB exposure are caused by the allosteric action of this insecticide on its molecular target, the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl). Collectively, these results provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of negative pesticide-induced responses in insects and reveal some key actors involved in the JH-signaling pathway that underpin pesticide resurgence.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Separating the information due to each of these components has been challenging, and the relationship as measured by fMRI in each of these cases Rest (network) and Task (stimulus-driven) remains a significant outstanding question in the study of large-scale brain dynamics. In this study, we develop a network ordinary differential equation (ODE) model using advanced system identification tools to analyze fMRI data from both rest and task conditions. We demonstrate that task-specific ODEs are essentially a subset of rest-specific ODEs across four different tasks from the Human Connectome Project. By assuming that task activity is a relative complement of rest activity, our model significantly improves predictions of reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis, leading to a 9 % increase in explanatory power (R2) across the 14 subtasks tested. We have additionally shown that these results hold for predicting missing trials and accuracy on a per individual basis as well as classifying Tasks trajectories or resulting dynamic Task functional connectivity. Our findings establish the principle of the Active Cortex Model, which posits that the cortex is always active and that Rest State encompasses all processes, while certain subsets of processes get elevated to perform specific task computations.

Wild-type (WT) mice showed stimulus-specific contextual modulation of the visual responses in the superior colliculus (SC) and pupil dynamics, whereas Scn2a-haploinsufficient ASD-model mice exhibited abnormal modulation patterns. In both genotypes, feedforward inputs from the retina to SC demonstrated no such contextual modulation. In contrast, feedback inputs from the primary visual cortex (V1) showed modulation patterns similar to those of SC cells in WT mice, but no modulation in Scn2a+/- mice. Furthermore, chemogenetic perturbation revealed that this top-down signaling from V1 to SC mediated the observed contextual modulation both at the neurophysiological and behavioral levels.

The connection between dynamically adapting phenotypic states and the molecular programs that define them is not well understood. Here we develop data-driven models of single-cell phenotypic responses to extracellular stimuli by linking gene transcription levels to morphodynamics, changes in cell morphology and motility observable in time-lapse image data. We adopt a dynamics-first view of cell state by grouping single-cell trajectories into states with shared morphodynamic responses. The single-cell trajectories enable development of a first-of-its-kind computational approach to map live-cell dynamics to snapshot gene transcript levels, which we term MMIST, Molecular and Morphodynamics-Integrated Single-cell Trajectories. The key conceptual advance of MMIST is that cell behavior can be quantified based on dynamically defined states and that extracellular signals change the overall distribution of cell states by altering rates of switching between states. We find a cell state landscape that is bound by epithelial and mesenchymal endpoints, with distinct sequences of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) intermediates. The analysis yields predictions for gene expression changes consistent with curated EMT gene sets and predicts expression of thousands of RNA transcripts through extracellular signal-induced EMT and MET with near-continuous time resolution. The MMIST framework leverages true single-cell dynamical behavior to generate molecular-level omics inferences and is broadly applicable to other biological domains, time-lapse imaging approaches and molecular snapshot data.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Thus, modification of the native airway community may serve as a means of altering the local environment in favor of health. While probiotic supplementation to prevent pathogen infiltration has been explored extensively in the gut, little has been done to study this phenomenon in the lower respiratory tract. In this work, we hypothesize that synthetic bacterial communities introduced into the airway can serve as prophylactic countermeasures against infection by a model bacterial pathogen (Burkholderia thailandensis) in mice. We demonstrate that understanding of antagonistic interactions between a pathogen and airway microbiota in vitro can guide identification of probiotics with protective capabilities in vivo. While production of secondary metabolites appears to play a role in pathogen antagonism, exploitative competition appears to be the predominant mechanism by which the organisms studied here inhibit B. thailandensis. Specifically we show that niche overlap and resource competition between the probiotic and pathogen are predictive of probiotic performance in vivo.

To date, stroke patients have only few therapeutic options and are often left with considerable disabilities. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based therapies are emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for stroke recovery. In this study, we demonstrate that local transplantation of iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) improves long-term brain tissue repair responses and reduces neurological deficits after cerebral ischemia in mice. Using in vivo bioluminescence imaging and post-mortem histology, we show long-term graft survival over the course of five weeks and preferential graft differentiation into mature neurons without signs of pluripotent residuals. Transplantation of NPCs led to a set of brain tissue repair responses including increased vascular sprouting and repair, improved blood-brain barrier integrity, reduced microglial activation, and increased neurogenesis compared to littermate control animals receiving sham transplantation. Employing deep learning-assisted behavior analysis, we found that NPC-treated mice displayed improved gait performance and complete fine-motor recovery in the horizontal ladder rung walk, five weeks post-injury. To dissect the molecular graft composition and identify graft-host interactions, single nucleus profiling of the cell transplants and host stroke tissue was performed. We identified graft differentiation preferentially towards neurons with GABAergic and glutamatergic phenotypes in similar proportions, with the remaining cells acquiring astrocyte and NPC-like phenotypes. Interaction between graft and host transcriptome indicated that GABAergic cell grafts were primarily involved in graft-host communication through the regeneration-associated neurexin (NRXN), neuregulin (NRG), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and SLIT signalling pathways. In conclusion, our study reveals that transplanted iPSC-derived NPCs primarily differentiate into GABAergic neurons contributing to long-term recovery and further delineates the regenerative interactions between the graft and the stroke-injured host tissue.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

The human antiviral restriction factor IFIT1 recognizes and binds to specific viral RNAs that lack the 5' features of host mRNAs, resulting in targeted suppression of viral RNA translation. This interaction imposes significant host-driven evolutionary pressures on viruses, and many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade the antiviral action of human IFIT1. However, little is known about the virus-driven pressures that may have shaped the antiviral activity of IFIT1 genes across mammals. Here, we take an evolution-guided approach to show that the IFIT1 gene is rapidly evolving in multiple mammalian clades, with positive selection acting upon several residues in distinct regions of the protein. In functional assays with 39 IFIT1s spanning diverse mammals, we demonstrate that IFIT1 exhibits a range of antiviral phenotypes, with many orthologs lacking antiviral activity against viruses that are strongly suppressed by other IFIT1s. We further show that IFIT1s from human and a bat, the black flying fox, inhibit Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and strongly bind to Cap0 RNAs. Unexpectedly, chimpanzee IFIT1, which differs from human IFIT1 by only 8 amino acids, does not inhibit VEEV infection and exhibits minimal Cap0 RNA-binding. In mutagenesis studies, we determine that amino acids 364 and 366, the latter of which is rapidly evolving, are sufficient to confer the differential anti-VEEV activity between human and chimpanzee IFIT1. These data suggest that virus-host genetic conflicts have influenced the antiviral specificity of IFIT1 across diverse mammalian orders.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Given the complete profile of mRNA targets and their editing rate in individual cells is unclear, we analyzed single cell RNA transcriptomes from Drosophila larval glutamatergic motoneuron subtypes to determine the most highly edited targets and identify single neuron editing rules. From ~15,000 genes encoded in the genome, 316 high confidence A-to-I canonical RNA edit sites were identified, with 60 causing missense amino acid changes predicted to alter proteins regulating membrane excitability, synaptic transmission, or neuronal function. Twenty-seven canonical sites were edited at >90% frequency as observed for editing of mammalian AMPA receptors, including coding edits in the Rdl GABA receptor, the nAChRalpha5 and nAChRalpha6 acetylcholine receptors, the Shab K+ channel, the NCKX30C Na+/K+-dependent Ca2+ exchanger and the postsynaptic scaffold Shank. However, most sites were edited at lower levels and generated variable expression of edited and unedited mRNAs, suggesting stochastic editing that may provide a mechanism to fine-tune synaptic function similar to alternative splicing. Among these variably edited targets were proteins with well-known presynaptic functions, including the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel Cacophony, the synaptic vesicle fusion regulator Complexin, the active zone scaffolding proteins RBP and Rim, and the endocytosis regulators Lap/AP180 and Endophilin. Comparison of these editing targets across other publicly available Drosophila RNAseq datasets identified several sites present exclusively in larval motoneurons, indicating the presence of cell-type and/or developmental-specific editing. Further comparisons confirmed the co-transcriptional nature of canonical editing and revealed editing is largely resistant to changes in neuronal activity, with only a few sites displaying evidence of being activity-regulated. Noncanonical editing was also found to occur in these neurons, including a C-to-U edit that altered an amino acid in the capsid hinge domain of the synaptic plasticity regulator Arc1.

Our approach utilizes deep neural networks to learn features from such raw nanopore signal data that can distinguish DNA from viable and dead microorganisms in a controlled experimental setting of UV-induced Escherichia cell death. The application of explainable AI tools then allows us to pinpoint the signal patterns in the nanopore raw data that allow the model to make viability predictions at high accuracy.

This application shows that our viability model captures predictive patterns in the nanopore signal that can be utilized to predict viability across taxonomic boundaries. We finally show the limits of our model's generalizability through antibiotic exposure of a simple mock microbial community, where a new model specific to the killing method had to be trained to obtain accurate viability predictions.

Understanding biotic interactions between these groups is essential for comprehending the emergence of diverse and complex ecosystems. Set within a 170-year primary succession gradient in a glacier forefield in the Austrian Alps, this study investigates interactions between vascular plants and bryophytes during early ecosystem development. Data on vegetation structural complexity, obtained through high-resolution 3D-laser scanning, were combined with estimates of local substrate diversity, and the taxonomic and functional composition of vascular plants. This integrated approach allowed us to obtain a mechanistic understanding on the competitive interactions shaping bryophyte diversity over the course of primary succession. Competitive interactions between vascular plants and bryophytes were uniquely detected through a metric of vegetation structural complexity, while traditional community metrics of vascular plant cover, richness, composition, and functional diversity, failed to reveal these patterns. Path analysis shows that increasing vegetation structural complexity homogenizes local habitat conditions and constrains the realized ecological niche of bryophyte species, while substrate diversity acts as a buffer against vascular plant dominance. This mechanism was quantified using ecological dispersion, a novel concept introduced in this study that estimates the variability of growth optima within a community. This study highlights the additional value of quantifying the structural properties of plant communities through 3D-laser scanning in explaining ecosystem dynamics. By demonstrating its applicability in grassland ecosystems under field conditions, it underscores the potential of high-resolution remote sensing to advance vegetation structural research.

Despite an initial characterization as proteasomal shuttle factors, Ubiquilins have paradoxically been reported to stabilize numerous substrates. The basis of this triage decision remains enigmatic. Many other fundamental aspects of Ubiquilin function are unclear at the mechanistic level, such as the physiological significance of Ubiquilin phase separation, the unique role of each Ubiquilin paralog, and the mechanistic defects of ALS mutants. To address these questions, we utilized a library of triple knockout (TKO) rescue cell lines with physiological expression of single Ubiquilin paralogs or disease mutants in an isogenic background. Our findings reveal that UBQLN2 has a unique ability to protect substrates from degradation and that substrate stabilization correlates with the recruitment of multiple E3 ligases, including SCFbxo7. We propose that E3 ligase recruitment promotes UBQLN2 phase separation, which protects substrates from proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this model, we demonstrate that ALS mutants, which were previously shown to have altered phase separation properties, also show a defect in substrate stabilization. Finally, we show that substrate stabilization appears to be a general feature of proteins that interact with the UBQLN2 Sti1 domains as amyloid precursor protein (APP) is also protected from proteasomal degradation by the formation of biomolecular condensates.

Septins are important for cytokinesis, but their exact roles are still obscure. In fission yeast, four septins (Spn1 to Spn4) accumulate at the rim of the division plane as rings. The octameric exocyst complex, which tethers exocytic vesicles to the plasma membrane, exhibits a similar localization and is essential for plasma membrane deposition during cytokinesis. Without septins, the exocyst spreads across the division plane but absent from the rim during septum formation. These results suggest that septins and the exocyst physically interact for proper localization and function. Indeed, we predicted six pairs of interactions between septin and exocyst subunits by AlphaFold, most of them are confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays.

This 'Weber behavior' has typically not been the focus of the prominent Bayesian paradigm, which models human perception as an optimal statistical inference conducted on the basis of noisy internal signals. Here we examine the variability of the estimates of a Bayesian observer, in comparison with human subjects. In two preregistered experiments, we manipulate the prior distribution and the reward function in a numerosity-estimation task. When the large numerosities are more frequent, and when they are more rewarding, the Bayesian observer exhibits an 'anti-Weber behavior', in which larger magnitudes results in less variable responses. Human subjects exhibit a similar pattern, thus breaking a long-standing result of psychophysics by showing the opposite behavior. This allows subjects to minimize the errors they make about the more frequent or the more rewarding magnitudes. Nevertheless, model fitting suggests that subjects' responses are best captured by a model that features a logarithmic encoding, a proposal of Fechner often regarded as accounting for Weber behavior. We thus obtain an anti-Weber behavior together with a Fechner encoding. Our results suggest that the increasing variability may be primarily due to the skewness of natural priors.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

While the neural underpinnings of flexibility have been studied for decades, limited knowledge exists about the structure and age-related differentiation of the white matter subserving brain regions implicated in cognitive flexibility. This study investigated the population-level relationship between cognitive flexibility and properties of white matter across two periods of adulthood, aiming to discern how these associations vary over different life stages and brain tracts. We propose a novel framework to study age effects in brain structure-function associations. First, a meta-analysis was conducted to identify neural regions associated with cognitive flexibility. Next, the white matter projections of these neural regions were traced through the Human Connectome Project tractography template to identify the white matter structure associated with cognitive flexibility. Then, a cohort analysis was performed to characterize myelin-related macromolecular features using a subset of the UK Biobank magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which has a companion functional/behavioral dataset. We found that (1) the wiring of cognitive flexibility is defined by a subset of brain tracts, which present undifferentiated features early in adulthood and significantly differentiated types in later life. (2) These MRI-derived properties are correlated with individual subprocesses of cognition, which are closely related to cognitive flexibility function. (3) In late life, myelin-related homogeneity of specific white matter tracts implicated in cognitive flexibility declines with age, a phenomenon not observed in early life. Our findings support the age-related differentiation of white matter tracts implicated in cognitive flexibility as a natural substrate of adaptive cognitive function.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

CD300e, a myeloid receptor involved in immune regulation, has an uncharacterized role in CRC.

In vitro cocultures of patient-derived tumor organoids and human monocytes revealed that tumor-derived signals induce CD300e expression and promote a protumorigenic macrophage profile. Using CD300e knockout mice in AOM/DSS and MC38 CRC models, we found that CD300e loss reduced tumor burden, enhanced MHC expression on TAMs, and improved T-cell responses. Transcriptomic and functional analyses demonstrated that CD300e-deficient macrophages exhibit increased phagocytosis, upregulated antigen presentation, and greater support for T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. Adoptive transfer confirmed that macrophage-intrinsic CD300e expression is sufficient to suppress T-cell function and promote tumor growth.

Finite element modelling (FEM) is a powerful tool for studying VEP biomechanics but relies on accurate material property inputs, which remain difficult to obtain. Synchrotron computed tomography (sCT) allows for detailed visualisation of the microstructure of intact VEPs under near-physiological loads and, when coupled with digital volume correlation (DVC), can be used to quantify three-dimensional (3D) strain fields, providing experimental reference data for FEM validation. We developed an inversion pipeline to spatially couple DVC data with an image-based FE model, and thus to estimate the elastic properties of rat VEPs. On the first rat lumbar FEM, the pipeline estimated a VEP elastic modulus of 129 MPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.24. Welch's ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences between FEM and DVC strain distributions (p < 0.001) but with small effect sizes, indicating high practical similarity. Its efficacy was further validated using Bland-Altman analysis, demonstrating over 95% spatial agreement between the FEM-predicted strains and the DVC measurements across multiple loading steps. The pipeline's consistency was further evaluated across multiple rat lumbar FE models (n = 3), yielding an averaged VEP elastic modulus = 145 MPa and a Poisson's ratio = 0.28. Statistically significant regional variations of strain distribution in VEPs were also identified (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). This study highlighted the efficacy of the developed pipeline in estimating the isotropic elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of VEP FEMs in a physiologically relevant, complex load transfer system.

MIR319C, one of the three miR319-producing genes in Arabidopsis, is expressed throughout the incipient leaf primordia, and its expression domain gets restricted to the base at later stages, partly due to its transcriptional repression by JAW-TCPs. However, the factors that activate and maintain MIR319C expression in leaf primordia are yet unknown. Here, we identify the CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON2 (CUC2) TF as a direct activator of MIR319C transcription. Using a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen, we identified several NAC domain TFs as potential regulators of MIR319C. Subsequent ex vivo binding and transactivation assays suggested that CUC2 binds to a distal promoter region of the MIR319C locus and activates its transcription. Mutants with compromised CUC2 and MIR319C activities resulted in smaller leaves with fewer cells. Detailed morphometric analysis of higher order CUC2 and MIR319 loss-of-function mutants highlighted the crucial role of the CUC2-MIR319 module in maintaining the duration of cell proliferation in leaf primordia. Additionally, the phenotype of mutants with altered CUC2 and MIR319/JAW-TCP activities demonstrated that CUC2 enhances leaf size through the MIR319C-JAW-TCP pathway. Overall, our findings uncovered a novel role for CUC2 in sustaining cell division by activating MIR319C transcription in the leaf primordia.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Hence, this study assessed the transcriptional response of the primary malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, to infection with several lines of the candidate vector-control parasite, the microsporidian Vavraia culicis. These parasite lines were selected for early or late transmission within this host. Previous studies extensively described them phenotypically, differing in their virulence, infection dynamics and host exploitation. Using RNA sequencing, gene expression profiles were analyzed in An. gambiae mosquitoes infected with early-transmission-selected, late-transmission-selected, and unselected (Stock ) V. culicis lines, as well as in uninfected controls. The results revealed distinct transcriptional changes associated with each parasite line. Early-selected parasites induced a broader immune response than late-selected ones. Differential expression of immune-related genes, including Toll-interacting protein and Protein ERGIC-53, was identified. Additionally, significant changes were observed in pathways related to Golgi membrane function and oxidative stress response, particularly in response to early-selected parasites. These findings highlight the evolutionary pressures shaping host-parasite coevolution and provide insight into how parasite transmission traits can influence the mosquito's immune response and regulation.

A common approach to analyze such data is to model observed allele counts infinite samples using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) where hidden states are true allele frequencies over time (i.e. a trajectory). The HMM framework allows to compute the full likelihood of the data, while accounting both for the stochastic evolution of population allele frequencies along time and for the noise arising from sampling a limited number of individuals at possibly spread out generations. Several such HMM methods have been proposed so far, differing mainly in the way they model the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. Following Paris et al.

In contrast to the extensive morphological and molecular characterization of sensory neurons, there has been little description of the cells that control ion concentrations in the zebrafish olfactory system. Here, we report the molecular and ultrastructural characterization of zebrafish olfactory ionocytes. Transcriptome analysis suggests that the zebrafish olfactory epithelium contains at least three different ionocyte types, which resemble Na+/K+-ATPase-rich (NaR), H+-ATPase-rich (HR), and Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC) cells, responsible for calcium, pH, and chloride regulation, respectively, in the zebrafish skin. In the olfactory epithelium, NaR-like and HR-like ionocytes are usually adjacent to one another, whereas NCC-like cells are usually solitary. The distinct subtypes are differentially distributed: NaR-like/HR-like cell pairs are found broadly within the olfactory epithelium, whereas NCC-like cells reside within the peripheral non-sensory multiciliated cell zone. Comparison of gene expression and serial-section electron microscopy analysis indicates that the NaR-like cells wrap around the HR-like cells and are connected to them by shallow tight junctions. The development of olfactory ionocyte subtypes is also differentially regulated, as pharmacological Notch inhibition leads to a loss of NaR-like and HR-like cells, but does not affect NCC-like ionocyte number. These results provide a molecular and anatomical characterization of olfactory ionocytes in a stenohaline freshwater teleost. The paired ionocytes suggest that both transcellular and paracellular transport regulate ion concentrations in the olfactory epithelium, while the solitary ionocytes may enable independent regulation of ciliary beating.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we use Drosophila ovarian germ cells as a model to study the role of cytonemes in BMP signalling-directed dedifferentiation to germline stem cells. We provide evidence that differentiating germ cell cysts extend longer cytonemes that are more polarised towards the niche during dedifferentiation to reactivate BMP signalling. The presence of additional somatic cells in the niche is associated with a failure of germ cell dedifferentiation, consistent with the formation of a physical barrier to cytoneme-niche contact and outcompetition of germ cells for BMP. Using BMP beads in vitro, we show that these are sufficient to induce cytoneme-dependent contacts in Drosophila tissue culture cells. We demonstrate that the Enabled (Ena) actin polymerase is localised to the tips of germ cell cytonemes and is necessary for robust cytoneme formation, as its mislocalisation reduces the frequency, length and directionality of cytonemes. Furthermore, specifically perturbing cytoneme function through Ena mislocalisation reduces germ cell BMP responsiveness and the ability of differentiating cysts to dedifferentiate. We discuss how cytonemes may be widely used by differentiating cells to re-establish niche contact and signal responsiveness following stem cell loss, promoting robust dedifferentiation of stem cells in diverse contexts.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Using the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland (SG) as a model, we identify Papss, an enzyme that synthesizes the universal sulfate donor PAPS, as a critical regulator of tube lumen expansion. Papss mutants show a disorganized apical membrane, condensed aECM, and disruptions in Golgi structures and intracellular trafficking. SG-specific expression of wild-type Papss, but not the catalytically inactive form, rescues the defects in Papss mutants, suggesting that defects in sulfation are the underlying cause of the phenotypes. Additionally, we identify two zona pellucida (ZP) domain proteins, Piopio (Pio) and Dumpy (Dpy), as key components of the SG aECM. In the absence of Papss, Pio is gradually lost in the aECM, while the Dpy-positive aECM structure is condensed and dissociates from the apical membrane, leading to a thin lumen. Mutations in dpy or pio, or in Notopleural, which encodes a matriptase that cleaves Pio to form the luminal Pio pool, result in a SG lumen with alternating bulges and constrictions, with the loss of pio leading to the loss of Dpy in the lumen.

IgA and IgG expression in tumors have shown predictive value in melanoma and KRAS-mutated, but not KRAS wild-type, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). To investigate the functional differences between B cells producing these isotypes, we performed bulk transcriptome analysis of tumor-infiltrating surface-IgA+ (sIgA+) and sIgG+ memory B cells in LUAD. In LUAD, sIgA+ B cells overexpressed FCRL4, PDCD1, and RUNX2, suggesting an atypical chronically antigen-stimulated phenotype with features of exhaustion. Public scRNA-seq data revealed FCRL4-expressing TIBs as a distinct cluster with upregulation of genes involved in IFN{gamma} and IFN responses. sIgG+ B cells from LUAD overexpressed IL5RA, indicating a role for IL-5 in class-switch recombination to IgG. TCGA LUAD cohort analysis showed that the FCRL4/CD20 expression ratio correlates with lower survival, reinforcing FCRL4 as a marker of dysfunctional TIBs. Additionally, in renal cancer, high IGHA1/IGHG1 ratios were linked to worse survival.

M.", "abstract": "Evolution has developed a set of principles that determine feasible domain combinations, analogous to grammar within natural languages. Treating domains as words and proteins as sentences, made up of domain words, we apply a linguistic approach to represent the human proteome as an n-gram network, which we call hereafter as Domain Architecture Network Syntax (DANSy). Combining DANSy with network theory, we explore the abstract rules of domain word combinations within the human proteome and identify connections that determine feasible protein functionality. We analyze the entropic information content of these domain word connections to establish a DANSy network that balances recovering most of proteome with n-gram complexity. Additionally, we explored subnetwork languages by focusing on reversible post-translational modifications (PTMs) systems that follow a reader-writer-eraser paradigm. We find that PTM systems appear to sample grammar rules near the onset of the system expansion, but then converge towards similar grammar rules, which stabilize during the post-metazoan switch. For example, reader and writer domains are typically tightly connected through shared n-grams, but eraser domains are almost always loosely or completely disconnected from readers and writers. Additionally, after grammar fixation, domains with verb-like properties, such as writers and erasers, never appear together -- consistent with the idea of natural grammar that leads to clarity and limits futile enzymatic cycles. Given how some cancer fusion genes represent the possibility for the emergence of novel language, we investigate how cancer fusion genes alter the human proteome n-gram network. We find most cancer fusion genes follow existing grammar rules. Finally, we adapt our DANSy analysis for differential expression (deDANSy) analysis to determine the relationship of coordinated changes in domain language syntax to cell phenotypes. We applied deDANSy to RNA-sequencing data from SOX10-deficient melanoma cells, finding that we can use network separation and syntax enrichment to characterize the molecular basis of cell phenotypes and identify novel information distinct from gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approaches. Collectively, these results suggest that n-gram based analysis of proteomes is a complement to direct protein interaction approaches, is more fully described than protein-protein interaction networks, and can be used to provide unique insights for signaling pathway enrichment analysis.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

To address this, we looked for SSR-binding proteins and investigated if SSRs function as enhancer blockers in vivo. We developed a novel Drosophila assay to assess enhancer blocker activity in vivo and to circumvent the low throughput and position effects seen in traditional enhancer blocker assays. Our assay uses endogenous vestigial gene enhancers, which, when blocked, result in easily scorable wing phenotypes increasing throughput. The attP-attB-based recombination system to integrate test fragments at specific site avoids positional effects. Furthermore, using EMSAs and DNA pull-downs followed by LC-MS/MS, we show that SSRs bind to proteins in a sequence-specific manner and identify 33 unique SSR-binding proteins.

METHODS: Alzheimers Disease (AD) related entries in Gene Ontology and DrugBank were integrated into a Knowledge Graph database to inform LLM prompts. 16,581 drugs were screened for their DR potential by the LLM Llama3:8b. The vector embedding representation of the drugs in the LLM was investigated to asses if LLMs store pharmacological information in alignment with domain expert understanding of pharmacological groups. By measuring the semantic similarity of drugs quantitatively, the performance of the DR pipeline was examined. A manual hallucination check was performed to assess the impact of the ontology-database combination on LLM-hallucination performance. The results were compared against registered clinical trials (RCTs) and proposed medications in meta-analyses to evaluate their predictive value. RESULTS: The embedding analysis showed that the vector representations of drugs in the LLM show clusters in alignment with pharmacological groups. The ontologically enhanced prompt was closer to the expert domain proposals than a zero-shot control prompt without that knowledge. The results of the ontology-based prompt showed fewer hallucinations in their responses compared to the zero-shot control prompting. CONCLUSIONS: Ontology-augmented LLM interaction leads to fewer hallucinations and output closer to expert assessment in comparison with a zero-shot control.

Trained on diverse clustered non-coding RNAs, RNAGenesis leverages a BERT-style encoder, query-based latent compression, and a diffusion-guided decoder enhanced by inference-time alignment with gradient guidance and beam search strategies. Through comprehensive evaluations, RNAGenesis achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 of 13 tasks in the BEACON benchmark and surpasses structure-aware models in inverse folding, 3D structure prediction, and de novo structure design. We further introduce RNATx-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for RNA therapeutics comprising over 100,000 experimentally validated sequences. RNAGenesis demonstrates strong predictive performance across ASOs, siRNAs, shRNAs, circRNAs, and untranslated region (UTR) variants. Furthermore, RNAGenesis enables functional RNA design, including aptamers targeting IGFBP3 and structurally constrained sgRNA scaffolds. Wet-lab validation confirms aptamer binding with KD values as low as 4.02~nM and up to 2.5-fold improvement in editing efficiency across CRISPR-Cas9, base editing, and prime editing systems. These results position RNAGenesis as a next-generation general-purpose RNA foundation model with broad utility for computational modeling and experimental therapeutic design.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Allele frequency clines along environmental gradients, known as genotype-environment associations (GEA), are often used to detect potential loci causing local adaptation but are rarely followed by experimental validation. Here, we tested loci identified in three moisture-related GEA studies on Arabidopsis. We studied 42 GEA-identified genes using t-DNA knockout lines under drought and tested effects on flowering time, an adaptive trait, and genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions on performance and fitness. In total, 16/42 genes had significant effects on traits involved in local adaptation or performance response to environment. We found that wrky38 mutants had significant GxE effects for fitness; lsd1 plants had a significant GxE effect for flowering time, while 11 genes showed flowering time effects with no drought interaction. However, most GEA candidates did not exhibit GxE. In the follow-up experiments, wrky38 caused decreased stomatal conductance and specific leaf area under drought, indicating potentially adaptive drought avoidance. Additionally, GEA identified natural putative LoF variants of WRKY38 associated with dry environments, as well as alleles associated with variation in LSD1 expression. While only a few GEA-identified genes were validated for GxE interactions for fitness under drought, we likely overlooked some because experiments might not well represent natural environments and t-DNA insertions might not well represent natural alleles. Nevertheless, GEAs apparently identified some genes contributing to local adaptation. GEA and follow-up experiments are straightforward to implement in model systems and demonstrate prospects for GEA discovery of new local adaptations.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

O. B.; Mirarab, S.", "abstract": "Comparing each sequencing read in a sample to large databases of known genomes has become a fundamental tool with wide-ranging applications, including metagenomics. These comparisons can be based on read-to-genome alignment, which is relatively slow, especially if done with the high sensitivity needed to characterize queries without a close representation in the reference dataset. A more scalable alternative is assigning taxonomic labels to reads using signatures such as k-mer presence/absence. A third approach is placing reads on a reference phylogeny, which can provide a far more detailed view of the read than a single label. However, phylogenetic placement is currently only possible at scale for marker genes, constituting a small fraction of the genome. No current method is able to place all reads originating from anywhere in the genome on an ultra-large reference phylogeny. In this paper, we introduce krepp, an alignment-free k-mer-based method that enables placing reads from anywhere on the genome on an ultra-large reference phylogeny by first computing a distance from each read to every reference genome. To compute these distances and placements, krepp uses a host of algorithmic techniques, including locality-sensitive hashing to allow inexact k-mer matches, k-mer coloring graphs to map k-mers to reference genomes, maximum likelihood distance estimation, and likelihood ratio test for placement. Our experiments show that krepp is extremely scalable, improving on alignment by up to roughly 10x, computes very accurate distances that approximate those using alignments, and produces highly accurate placements. When used in the metagenomics context, the precise phylogenetic identifications provided by krepp improve our ability to compare and differentiate samples from different environments.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

We here contribute another piece to the puzzle by providing a high-quality reference genome for the Ural Owl (Strix uralensis), a species of conservation concern and efforts affected by habitat destruction and climate change. Results We generated a reference genome assembly for the Ural Owl based on high-fidelity (HiFi) long reads and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. It figures amongst the best avian genome assemblies currently available (BUSCO completeness of 99.94 %). The primary assembly had a size of 1.38 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 90.1 Mb, while the alternative assembly had a size of 1.3 Gb and a scaffold N50 of 17.0 Mb. We show an exceptionally high repeat content (21.07 %) that is different from those of other bird taxa with repeat extensions. We confirm a Strix characteristic chromosomal fusion and support the observation that bird microchromosomes have a higher density of genes, associated with a reduction in gene length due to shorter introns. An analysis of gene content provides evidence of changes in the keratin gene repertoire as well as modifications of metabolism genes of owls. This opens an avenue of research if this is related to flight adaptations. The population size history of the Ural Owl decreased over long periods of time with increases during the Eemian interglacial and stable size during the last glacial period. Ever since it is declining to its currently lowest effective population size. We also investigated cell culture of progressive passages as a tool for genetic resources. Karyotyping of passages confirmed no large variants, while a SNP analysis revealed a low presence of short variants across cell passages. Conclusions The established reference genome is a valuable resource for ongoing conservation efforts, but also for (avian) comparative genomics research. Further research is needed to determine whether cell culture passages can be safely used in genomic research.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

The possibility of tracking brain activity changes following tES via neurophysiological markers would benefit a better understanding of tES effects and the future development of tES protocols. One promising marker is the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), an externally controlled oscillatory brain activity, typically at 40 Hz, evoked by a periodic auditory stimulus. This study examined the offline effects of different types of tES on 40-Hz ASSR. Participants underwent four conditions of tES, which were applied over the left posterior parietal cortex: transcranial direct current (tDCS), transcranial alternating current (tACS), oscillatory transcranial direct current (otDCS) and sham stimulation. Individually determined theta frequency was delivered in the tACS and otDCS protocols. Following the tES application, electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during 40-Hz auditory click stimulation. Mixed-effects modeling revealed no significant group-level differences in phase locking or evoked amplitude between stimulation conditions. However, both baseline (sham) ASSR and the change in ASSR following tES had a substantial interindividual variability. Exploratory analysis showed that individuals with lower baseline ASSR had increased synchronization following tES. Furthermore, the increase in ASSR synchronization was linked to higher memory gain; however, the relationship was observed only in otDCS condition. The findings encourage future research focusing on individual factors that may contribute to tES outcomes.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

The ISRGDF15 index was validated using optogenetic activation of the ISR protein kinase R (PKR) in a stable cell line, demonstrating its rapid kinetics preceding to GDF15 gene expression. We then deployed the ISRGDF15 index across 44 postmortem human tissues, reporting that the ISRGDF15 was upregulated in the heart of individuals who died of an acute cause in the emergency room, whereas it was preferentially upregulated in the brain of individuals who died as inpatients after protracted hospital stays. ISRGDF15 was also moderately, positively correlated with age across all tissues.

In a systematic evaluation of publications (n = 2929) spanning human gut microbiome research, and in three case studies of soil and gut microbiota used to manually validate the evaluation tool (n = 370), we found nearly half of publications do not meet minimum standards for sequence data availability.

Behaviorally, we found that manipulating prior beliefs causally affected confidence without corresponding changes in accuracy and a negligible effect on reaction times. The EEG data showed a monotonic relation between the reported level of confidence and both CPP and Pe amplitudes. Importantly, this finding is compatible both with the theory that these signals track confidence as well as with the alternative theory that they track accumulated evidence. Critically, both neural signals were insensitive to the influence of prior beliefs on confidence, showing that they reflect the accumulated evidence that is used by the system to compute confidence, not directly confidence. Likewise, oscillatory activity in alpha and beta band was insensitive to the influence of prior beliefs on confidence. Decoding analyses revealed that the brain does hold shared representations for prior beliefs and confidence, and we identified a frontal signal that is sensitive to both confidence and prior beliefs.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

B.; Mitarai, N.", "abstract": "Bacteria can enter dormancy triggered by stress, such as starvation. When stress is removed, a large part of the population will exhibit some lag time before regrowth. It has been observed that even under stress-free conditions that allow for exponential growth, a small subpopulation can spontaneously enter dormancy temporarily. The dormant population often survives antibiotic application because many types of antibiotics target the cell growth and division process. If bacteria are in an environment where antibiotics are sometimes applied, the population can evolve to adjust their dormancy frequency to better survive antibiotics without losing too much of the population growth. Here, we consider the situation in which antibiotics are applied stochastically during repeated feast-famine cycles. We analyse the best strategy for long-term growth when the bacteria are allowed to tune both the lag time at the start of the feast period and the spontaneous dormancy in the feast period. We show that spontaneous dormancy can provide an advantage only when the antibiotic application and the start of the feast period are decoupled. When the triggered dormant and spontaneous dormant states are treated as different states and the antibiotic addition time is fixed, the optimal strategy is either triggered or spontaneous dormancy. Exhibiting both types of dormancy is optimal only when there is a certain level of stochastic fluctuation in the antibiotic application timing.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

One of the early hallmarks of cancer is DNA hypomethylation in genomic repeat regions, resulting in the expression of normally silenced endogenous viral elements. Such epigenetic changes have the potential to augment anti-tumor immune responses as well as reduce tumor cell fitness through the generation of aberrant nucleic acid species (NAS) and consequent activation of NAS-sensing pathways. Therefore, tumor evolution should favor additional selective events that suppress NAS generation, possibly yielding specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. Here, we show that the Lysine Demethylase 5 (KDM5) family of epigenetic regulatory enzymes suppress R-loop formation in genomic repeat regions in cancer cells. We find that KDM5 inhibition in luminal breast cancer cells results in R-loop-mediated DNA damage, reduced cell fitness and an increase in ISG and AP signatures as well as cell surface Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I, mediated by RNA:DNA hybrid activation of the CGAS/STING pathway. KDM5 inhibition does not result in DNA damage or activation of the CGAS/STING pathway in normal breast epithelial cells, suggesting that KDM5 inhibitors may enable a wide therapeutic window in this setting, as compared to STING agonists or Type I Interferons.

This study investigated age-related effects on multisensory processing and learning during audio-visual and tactile-visual learning in 67 children (5.7-13 years) by integrating behavioural and neuroimaging data with computational methods. A reinforcement-learning drift diffusion model revealed that older children processed information faster and made more efficient decisions on multisensory associations. These age-related increases coincided with higher activity in brain regions associated with cognitive control, multisensory integration, and memory retrieval, specifically during audio-visual learning. Notably, the bilateral anterior insula exhibited heightened activation in response to lower reward prediction errors, indicative of increased sensitivity to negative feedback with development. Finally, reward prediction errors modulated activation in reward processing and cognitive control regions, with this modulation remaining modality-independent and largely stable across age. In conclusion, while children employ similar learning strategies, older children make decisions more efficiently and engage neural resources more strongly.

The rapid increase of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria including MDR E. faecalis necessitates the development of alternative therapies and a deeper understanding of the factors that impact HGT. CRISPR-Cas systems provide sequence-specific defense against HGT. From previous studies, we know that E. faecalis CRISPR-Cas provides sequence-specific anti-plasmid defense during agar plate biofilm mating and in the murine intestine. Those studies were mainly conducted using laboratory model strains with a single, CRISPR-targeted plasmid in the donor. MDR E. faecalis typically possess multiple plasmids that are diverse in sequence and may interact with each other to impact plasmid transfer and CRISPR-Cas efficacy. Here, we altered multiple parameters of our standard in vitro conjugation assays to assess CRISPR-Cas efficacy, including the number and genotype of plasmids in the donor, and laboratory model strains as donor versus recent human isolates as donor during conjugation. We found that the plasmids pTEF2 and pCF10, which are not targeted by CRISPR-Cas in our recipient, enhance the conjugative transfer of the CRISPR-targeted plasmid pTEF1 into both wild-type and CRISPR-Cas-deficient (via deletion of cas9) recipient cells. However, the effect of pTEF2 on pTEF1 transfer is much more pronounced, with a striking 6-log increase in pTEF1 conjugation frequency when pTEF2 is also present in the donor and recipients are deficient for CRISPR-Cas (compared to 4-log for pCF10).

Therefore, environments that facilitate adaptive behavioural plasticity could relax the strength of natural selection, but experimental evidence for this prediction remains scarce. Here, we first demonstrate that maternal care in the beetle Callosobruchus maculatus is dependent on environmental cues that allow females to reduce larval competition via learning and informed oviposition choices. We show that this facilitation of maternal care relaxes selection against deleterious alleles in offspring. We further find that mothers of low genetic quality generally provide poorer care. However, when receiving environmental cues providing accurate information about future host-quality, the increased opportunity for adaptive behavioural plasticity reduced genetic differences in maternal care, further relaxing selection against deleterious alleles. We use our data to illustrate how the identified link between adaptive behavioural plasticity in maternal care and the strength of natural selection can impact indirect genetic effects between mothers and offspring and the accumulation of cryptic genetic loads in populations inhabiting environments that differ in their predictability.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

While migration routes and stopover sites of the Common Crane in the CAF are documented, seasonal variations in migration strategies, potential detours, bottlenecks, and stopover habitat selection, important factors for flyway conservation planning, remain poorly understood. To address this, we tracked five individuals from Gujarat, western India, to breeding sites in southwestern Siberia using solar-powered GPS-GSM transmitters, enabling high-resolution, multi-season analysis of their migration strategies, routes, timing, detours, bottlenecks, and stopover habitat selection. Results: The results highlighted seasonally differential migration strategies in Common Cranes. The analyses confirmed significant seasonal differences: Spring migration covered greater distances, lasted longer, and was slower, with higher stopover duration and reduced straightness. The observed migration routes deviated significantly from the simulated straight-line path, forming distinct detours likely to avoid the Hindu Kush mountains and take advantage of resource-rich areas. These detours resulted in routes that were 23.3% longer in autumn and 36.8% longer in spring compared to the shortest possible path. The tagged Common Cranes followed distinct seasonal migration routes that converged in Turkmenistan, creating migratory bottlenecks in Southern Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. At migration stopover sites, Common Cranes showed the highest probability of habitat use in bare ground (0.18) and cropland (0.13), suggesting a preference for open landscapes by the species. Conclusion: Our findings reveal the adaptive strategies of Common Cranes in response to seasonal and topographical challenges. Cranes undertake substantial detours to optimize energy expenditure and access favorable stopover habitats.

Our results show that katydids walk more slowly as the incline angle increases and as katydid mass increases, with a decrease of around 0.3~BL/s for every 1{degrees} increase in incline. At steeper inclines and larger sizes, katydids are also less likely to use an alternating tripod gait, opting instead to maintain more limbs in contact with the substrate during walking. Katydids also increased average duty factor when climbing steeper inclines and with increasing body mass. However, substrate roughness did not affect walking speed or gait preference in our trials. These findings provide insights into how environmental factors influence locomotor strategies in katydids and enhance our understanding of effective locomotor strategies in hexapods.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Although GPCRs have been relatively well characterized in metazoans, GPCR signaling is poorly understood in their sister group, the choanoflagellates, and in other close relatives of metazoans (CRMs). Here, we examine GPCR diversity and evolution in choanoflagellates by curating a catalog of 918 GPCRs, 141 G proteins, and 367 associated regulators from 23 choanoflagellate genomes and transcriptomes. We found that the repertoire of choanoflagellate GPCRs is larger and more diverse than previously anticipated, with 18 GPCR families found in choanoflagellates, of which 12 families are newly identified in these organisms. Comparative analyses revealed that most choanoflagellate GPCR families are conserved in metazoans and/or other eukaryotic lineages. Adhesion GPCRs and a class of GPCRs fused to kinases (the GPCR-TKL/Ks) are the most abundant GPCRs in choanoflagellates. The identification of GPCR repertoires in CRMs and other non-metazoans refines our understanding of metazoan GPCR evolution and reveals the existence of previously unreported GPCR families in metazoans and at the root of the eukaryotic tree.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

A crucial challenge in targeted manipulation experiments is the identification of high-efficacy perturbation sites whose stimulation exerts desired effects, currently done with costly trial-and-error procedures. Can one predict stimulation effects solely based on observations of the circuit activity, in the absence of perturbation? We answer this question in dissociated neuronal cultures on High-Density Microelectrode Arrays (HD-MEAs), which, compared to in vivo preparations, offer a controllable in vitro platform that enables precise stimulation and full access to network dynamics. We first reconstruct the perturbome - the full map of network responses to focal electrical stimulation - by sequentially activating individual single sites and quantifying their network-wide effects. The measured perturbome patterns cluster into functional modules, with limited spread across clusters. We then demonstrate that the perturbome can be predicted from spontaneous activity alone. Using short baseline recordings in the absence of perturbations, we estimate Effective Connectivity (EC) and show that it predicts the spatial organization of the perturbome, including spatial clusters and local connectivity. Our results demonstrate that spontaneous dynamics encode the latent causal structure of neural circuits and that EC metrics can serve as effective, model-free proxies for stimulation outcomes. This framework enables data-driven targeting and causal inference in vitro, with potential applications to more complex preparations such as human iPSC-derived neurons and brain organoids, with implications for both basic research and therapeutic strategies targeting neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

However, NMD's importance also extends to the control of isoform abundance under physiological conditions. During viral infection, NMD is inhibited through numerous mechanisms; however, NMD has been shown to have both antiviral as well as proviral activities, raising further questions into the role and control of NMD during viral infection. These observations have led us to investigate the potential involvement of NMD in dsRNA sensing as a mechanism that might explain these discrepancies. Using EIF4A2 exon 10B inclusion as an example of AS-NMD isoform accumulating during viral infection, we show that dsRNA sensing inhibits NMD. This effect is correlated with translational blockade and is driven primarily by RNaseL activation, and by PKR in the absence of RNaseL activation. Surprisingly, NMD inhibition limits the induction of IFN-{beta} as well as interferon-stimulated genes, and this effect is upstream of IRF3 phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus. NMD inhibition also decreases PKR and RNaseL activation as well as PIC-mediated cell death by decreasing the dsRNA content, suggesting NMD directly controls dsRNA sensing by controlling the dsRNA load. Therefore, inhibition of NMD upon dsRNA sensing provides a negative feedback loop that contributes to shaping the innate immune sensing pathways.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Its synthesis starts with HMGCS1 producing HMG-CoA, which is then converted to mevalonate by HMGCR, a target of statins. Cancer cells often upregulate enzymes in the mevalonate pathway (MVP) to meet their metabolic demands, leading to the development of inhibitors targeting several enzymes in this pathway. However, current inhibitors have not yet shown significant anti-cancer activity. While HMGCS1 has unique biochemical properties that distinguish it from other MVP enzymes, the effects of inhibiting HMGCS1 have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we present a set of chemical probes that enable us to systematically assess the proteome-wide selectivity and potency of Hymeglusin, the primary inhibitor of HMGCS1 used in the field, confirming it as a useful tool for short-term HMGCS1 inhibition. Inhibiting HMGCS1 with Hymeglusin causes proteome changes that are nearly identical to those caused by inhibiting HMGCR or degrading HMGCS1. Accordingly, simultaneously targeting HMGCS1 and HMGCR effectively suppresses the growth of statin-resistant cells and xenograft models, without increasing the risk of side effects. Finally, we find that while Hymeglusin is a valuable tool for short-term mechanistic studies, its usefulness is limited for long-term efficacy studies due to its poor stability in serum. Together, this study highlights the biological implications of targeting HMGCS1 as monotherapy or in combination with statins, and caution is required when using Hymeglusin as a tool.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

While perceived roughness is typically attributed to surface texture, real-world materials rarely vary in texture alone-they also differ in material properties such as elasticity. Whether material properties contribute to roughness perception, and how they might interact with surface cues, remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how texture and elasticity jointly influence perceived roughness by parametrically varying both features within a Bayesian optimization discrimination task. Participants compared pairs of stimuli differing in stochastic surface roughness and material elasticity, under both direct and tool-mediated touch. This approach enabled us to estimate two-dimensional perceptual functions and identify haptic roughness metamers-physically distinct stimuli perceived as equally rough. These perceptual equivalences were mirrored in confidence ratings and varied systematically with the relative stiffness between the stimulus and the probing tool or finger, implicating contact-induced vibrations as a mediating factor. Our findings reveal how texture and elasticity cues jointly constrain roughness perception, demonstrating that perceived roughness emerges from the integration of multiple stimulus dimensions rather than surface properties alone. These findings offer practical implications for the design of haptic interfaces and prosthetics, where equivalent percepts may be achieved through different combinations of material and texture, and contribute to a broader understanding of cue integration in haptic perception.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

W.; Yan, C.; Thiagarajan, S.; Cooper, V.

Providing high school students access to research experiences not only improves learning and can have positive and long-lasting impacts on their attitudes towards science, but also gives them the opportunity to make impactful scientific contributions. Through EvolvingSTEM, students evolve populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens in a bead model that includes daily cycles of bacterial dispersal, attachment, and biofilm growth and observe heritable changes in colony morphology. Genome sequencing of 70 mutants that they picked identified parallel mutations in genes known to regulate biofilm growth (wsp, yfiBNR, morA, fuzY) and uncovered novel adaptations: loss-of-function mutations in phosphodiesterase PFLU0185 that did not alter colony morphology and mutations affecting periplasmic disulfide bond formation producing small colonies. PFLU0185 mutants rapidly and consistently reached high frequencies and phenotyping revealed roles in cyclic di-GMP regulation, biofilm formation, and motility, prompting us to name this gene bmo (biofilm and motility regulator). Competition experiments and microscopy demonstrated bmo mutants employ generalist strategies and coexist with their ancestor and specialist mutants through niche differentiation. Consequently, phenotypic diversity is maintained, with smooth (ancestral and bmo) colonies consistently outnumbering wrinkly and fuzzy variants. This study advances our understanding of biofilm genetic architecture while demonstrating that student-led research can uncover mechanisms of microbial adaptation relevant to Pseudomonas infection biology. IMPORTANCE Bacterial biofilms dominate microbial life, yet their evolutionary genetics remain incompletely understood. Extensive replication of experiments that employ similar, but not identical, biofilm selection models can provide valuable insights into mechanisms of adaptation. We demonstrate that this can be achieved through university-education partnerships that engage secondary school students in authentic research. Student-led experiments revealed that loss-of-function mutations in a conserved phosphodiesterase, PFLU0185/bmo, dominate evolved populations without changing colony morphology. This finding, combined with diverse, less frequent mutants that alter colony morphology informs the process of biofilm niche differentiation. This work also demonstrates the power of distributed research networks for discovering new genetic pathways of adaptation. Students gained authentic research experience, potentially inspiring them to become scientists, while identifying mutants adapted to discrete conditions that maintain diversity within biofilms.

Computationally docking screening of both tri-,tetra-, and penta-mer peptides or innovative acetic-polymers (mimicking amino acids) and evolutecas generating thousands of ligand candidates, were employed to optimize their fitting to glutathion-prfA cavities. Combining library-screenings and evoluteca generations, novel top-peptides and top-acetic-polymers were generated predicting both low-toxicities (to reduce any known undesirable side-effects) and low nanoMolar consensus affinities (to maximize their specificities).

While unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria have been extensively characterized, the chloroplast UPR (cpUPR) remains less defined, partly due to the off-target effects of traditional stress-inducing methods. In this study, we provide direct evidence for the existence of the cpUPR by expressing engineered, folding-defective variants of ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) in plant chloroplasts. The expression of aggregation-prone proteins inside the organelle triggered a robust upregulation of chloroplast quality control components, including CLPB3, CLPC1/C2, and HSP90C, as revealed by immunodetection and quantitative proteomics. The proteomic response scaled with the severity of the folding defect, with the fully insoluble FNR {Delta}20 variant inducing broader changes than the partially soluble {Delta}3 variant. Network analysis showed that most differentially abundant proteins were chloroplastic and clustered into functional groups related to proteostasis and photosynthesis. Comparative analysis with lincomycin-treated plants highlighted the specificity and advantages of using misfolded proteins to study the cpUPR.

However, how such enhancers are maintained after cytokine exposure remains unclear. We report that durable IFN{gamma}-induced enhancers can last for days after cytokine washout, yet the underlying persistence mechanism is not cell-intrinsic. IFN{gamma}-treated macrophages continue to exhibit JAK/STAT signaling days after cytokine removal. Blocking IFN{gamma} signaling with a JAK inhibitor or anti-IFN{gamma} neutralizing antibodies after cytokine removal is sufficient to reverse IFN{gamma}-induced enhancers and erase the potentiated state of the treated macrophages.

In addition, C. difficile spores are considered essential for the onset, persistence and transmission of the disease, and their exosporium layer has hair-like projections formed by the BclA-family of proteins (BclA1, BclA2 and BclA3). Previous work in C1 and C2 strains has demonstrated that the absence of these proteins affects spore germination, pathogenesis, persistence, and recurrence of CDI. Nevertheless, the conservation of BclAs across different C. difficile clades remains unclear. In this work, genomics analysis in more than 25,000 C. difficile genomes revealed that the prevalence and variability of the BclAs was not conserved across classical and cryptic clades. The most represented clade on the dataset was C1, where roughly 50% of the genomes possessed all three bclA genes. Pseudogenization of bclA1 or all bclAs was observed in C2 and C3, respectively. Additionally, the absence of bclA1 in C4 and of both bclA1 & bclA3 in C5, further demonstrates the divergence of BclAs among C. difficile clades.

We illustrate how PNA can be used to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of cell function through protein interactions in hematological oncology, CAR-T cell therapies, and autoimmune disease.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

L.; Quach, D.; Sugie, J.; Pogliano, J.; Parish, T.", "abstract": "Objectives: The identification of novel agents with mechanisms of action distinct from those currently utilized in tuberculosis treatment remains a significant challenge. The mycobacterial protein MmpL3 has emerged as a promising drug target due to its essential role in the synthesis of the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We previously identified novel thienopyrimidine amides with good anti-tubercular activity. Methods: We profiled a subset of thienopyrimidine amides determining activity against intracellular bacteria and bactericidal activity against replicating bacteria. We ran assays to determine mode of action by measuring cell wall stress, ATP production, and bacterial cytological profiling. We determined activity against a strain of M. tuberculosis with mutations in MmpL3. We isolated and sequenced resistant mutants. Results: We tested five analogs against a strain of M. tuberculosis with mutations in MmpL3 and determined that they lost potency. Analogs induced PiniBAC, a reporter for cell wall stress, and led to an ATP boost characteristic of cell wall inhibitors. Bacterial cytological profiling of a representative compound revealed a morphological profile consistent with other MmpL3 inhibitors. Conclusions: Together, our data support MmpL3 as the most probable drug target for the TPA analogs and add to the growing list of scaffolds that can inhibit this vulnerable transporter.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The pleiotropy of minocycline (MINO), including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-migratory, anti-MMP, and neuroprotective effects, has been extensively reported. A novel non-antibiotic minocycline derivative, 10-butyl ether minocycline (BEM), was synthesized to retain the pleiotropy of minocycline while minimizing side effects such as antibiotic resistance and gut dysbiosis. Previously, we showed that BEM reduced alcohol consumption in dependent murine and porcine models of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of BEM to determine its potential as a therapeutic agent for neuroimmune and inflammatory conditions such as AUD. Here, we report that BEM showed a nearly complete loss of antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. typhi, and C. albicans. BEM showed a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability as measured by the MTT assay, similarly to MINO. BEM also suppressed LPS-induced microglial activation as shown by reduced Iba1 expression in immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. Inhibition of MMP-9 by BEM (IC50 = 42.2 {micro}M) was improved compared to MINO (IC50 = 60.3 {micro}M) while MMP-8 inhibition was moderate (IC50: BEM = 69.4 {micro}M; MINO = 45.4 {micro}M). BEM was found to be effective in inhibiting VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and L-glutamine-induced ROS levels. Limited inhibition of 15-LOX activity was observed (IC50: BEM = 92.6 {micro}M; MINO = 65.6 {micro}M). BEM was not toxic to mitochondria, even at high concentrations (200 {micro}M). By eliminating antimicrobial properties while preserving therapeutic pleiotropy, BEM presents an advancement in the development of a promising candidate with multimodal mechanisms to treat neuroimmune-inflammatory pathologies.\n\nImpactOur current approach to correlate non-antibacterial actions of BEM to MINOs established mechanistic effects will enable the informed use of BEM for several medical indications including for inflammation and neuroimmune conditions. The focus on BEMs multimodal actions and long-term safety during drug discovery represents a paradigm shift toward complex therapeutic drug development and repositioning, improving upon traditional singular high-affinity target-based approaches. Such new drug discovery attempts could potentially enhance treatment relevance in complex disorders with multiple targets and theoretically guide the creation of second-generation analogs.\n\nSignificance statementWe report mechanisms of action for BEM, a minocycline analog under evaluation for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder, which may also show efficacy for other complex disease processes that involve inflammatory or neuroimmune components. We show that BEM had a nearly complete loss of antimicrobial action, yet retained the pleiotropy of MINO, likely making it a better multimodal therapeutic for long-term treatment of complex diseases with neuroimmune-related components.\n\nVisual abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/661183v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11dd00dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4622c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@952063org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8168cf_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Created with Biorender.\n\nC_FIG", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

SETD6 belongs to the SET-domain-containing family of proteins, which are known to catalyze protein methylation, a post-translational modification that plays a critical role in regulating protein function, stability, and interactions. Using protein microarray technology, we identified RAD18 as an interactor and substrate of SETD6. We confirmed this interaction through ELISA and immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating that SETD6 directly binds and methylates RAD18. Using mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified that RAD18 undergoes mono-methylation at the K73 and K406 residues. Furthermore, we found that RAD18 methylation affects its nuclear localization. Specifically, SETD6 KO cells exhibited increased nuclear RAD18 levels, suggesting that methylation status influences RAD18s shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Notably, depletion of SETD6 led to elevated markers of DNA damage ({gamma}H2AX) and increased DNA breaks, as evidenced by comet assays. Restoring SETD6 activity significantly reduced DNA damage, while a catalytic inactive mutant did not have this effect, underscoring the importance of SETD6's enzymatic function. Overall, our results demonstrate that SETD6-mediated methylation of RAD18 is essential for attenuating DNA breaks, thereby regulating its cellular localization and function in maintaining genomic integrity.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Historically, persistent firing has been attributed to recurrent synaptic networks, in which neural activity reverberates. This view aligns with the widely accepted principle that neurons generate action potentials only in response to sufficiently strong input, and therefore do not serve as memory components. Here, we present evidence challenging this view, demonstrating in behaving mice that individual hippocampal neurons can sustain persistent firing, acting as a memory buffer for spatial representation. We first demonstrate that TRPC4 ion channel silencing selectively disrupts the capability of individual neurons to persistently fire using in vitro recordings in mice. This manipulation impairs spatial working memory performance, and significantly and selectively reduces persistent firing in vivo during the maintenance (delay) period of the task. Despite general belief that persistent firing maintains working memory contents, we find persistent firing to reflect continuous firing of spatial cells coding for spatial information, suggesting that maintenance of spatial representation in the hippocampus may depend on intrinsic cellular mechanism. We further demonstrate that TRPC4 silencing selectively affect hippocampal spatial coding where mice stayed in a place for an extended time (start and goal areas), pointing out the specific role of intrinsic cellular mechanisms of persistent firing in the retention of spatial information and potential coexistence of intrinsic cellular mechanism with attractor dynamics. Finally, task performance correlated with the strength of persistent firing in the goal area, suggesting that maintained goal representation in the hippocampus is crucial for the task performance. These findings redefine neurons as active contributors to information retention beyond their conventional role as passive input-output units, potentially reshaping our general understanding of brain computation.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Categorizing scans based on the presence or absence of significant pathology and image quality concerns, facilitates the repurposing of clinical brain MRI data for brain research. Such an approach has the potential to harness vast clinical imaging archives - exemplified by over 250,000 brain MRIs at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia - to address demographic biases in research participation, to increase sample size, and to improve replicability in neurodevelopmental imaging research.

We use an innovative computational approach to dissect out independent processes from scRNA-sequencing data to show that high Wnt activity alone elicits cell cycle exit through a Hedgehog mediator, Gli3. Furthermore, Hedgehog induces DC genes in a Wnt-dependent manner while cell-autonomously accelerating Wnt activity, effectively synchronizing cell cycle exit with DC gene expression.

Despite its importance in physiology and pathophysiology, BOCT1's structure and transport mechanism remain elusive. Here, we integrate cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), functional assays, biochemical experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the structure, substrate recognition, and transport mechanism of mouse BOCT1 (mBOCT1). The high-resolution cryo-EM structure reveals a distinctive N-terminal domain with a unique folding pattern dominated by a transmembrane loop atop TM6 (TML6), diverging from both known structures of SLC22 transporters and AlphaFold predictions. Notably, mBOCT1 functions as a high-capacity, low-affinity iron transporter independent of LCN2 binding. Iron transport is facilitated by a substrate gating mechanism involving TML6.

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules.

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the \"Porto do Son\" cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia.

H.; Cochran, A. M.; Ying, C. F.; Torii, K. U.", "abstract": "Stomata, valves on the plant epidermis, control gas and water vapor exchange. The patterning and spacing of stomata are primarily regulated by the ERECTA leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK). Ubiquitination is a crucial mechanism to regulate the homeostasis of RKs by impacting their protein stability and localization. It has been shown that plant U-box ubiquitin E3 ligases, PUB30 and PUB31, act as key attenuators of the ERECTA signaling pathway. However, the molecular link between ubiquitination and function of ERECTA remains unclear. Here, we reveal that perception of the peptide ligand EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR2 (EPF2) by ERECTA induces the K63-linked ubiquitination of ERECTA mediated by PUB30 and PUB31. We further identify the specific ubiquitination sites within the juxtamembrane and kinase domains of ERECTA. Importantly, the site-directed mutagenesis of these K63-linked ubiquitination sites overly inhibited stomatal development, indicating that the ubiquitination-deficient ERECTA is hyperactive. The ubiquitination-deficient ERECTA stably accumulates at the plasma membrane and fails to internalize upon EPF2 application. Our findings thus uncover a mechanism by which ligand-induced ubiquitination orchestrates receptor homeostasis and endocytosis for proper stomatal patterning and differentiation.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Simultaneous loss of GLK1 and GLK2 in Arabidopsis leads to pale-green plants with small, incompletely developed chloroplasts, revealing involvement of additional components. Following mutagenesis of a glk1-1 knock-down, glk2-1 knock-out (KO) mutant we identified suppressor of glks (sgl) 2, sgl2. The sgl2 glk1 glk2 triple mutant showed increases in chlorophyll, PhAN gene transcripts and thylakoid stacking in mesophyll cell chloroplasts, and enhanced cellular content of chloroplasts in mesophyll and bundle-sheath cells. The suppressor mutation delayed flowering but greening phenotypes preceded flowering. sgl2 was caused by loss of function of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR2, ARF2. arf2sgl2 boosted chloroplast content. It dramatically suppressed the developmental and chloroplast delay of the phytochrome-deficient long hypocotyl 1 (hy1) mutant. We observed in glk1-1 glk2-1 low but detectable expression of GLK1, which was elevated in arf2sgl2 glk1-1 glk2-1, and saw reduced suppression by arf2sgl2 of a glk1-2 glk2-2 mutant carrying KO alleles, revealing partial epistasis. Overexpression of Growth Regulating Factor 5 (GRF5), upregulated in arf2sgl2, rescued chlorophyll levels in glk1-1 glk2-1, consistently with ARF2 and GRF5 as a transcription module. In developing cereal leaves presumed orthologs of ARF2 and GRF5 are expressed at early stages of plastid proliferation and assembly, preceding GLK expression during greening stage. ARF2 is therefore a negative switch modulating GRF5 early in chloroplast development in photosynthetic cells, upstream of the GLKs.

The biotrophic fungus Ustilago maydis causes galls on all aerial parts of maize. However, identification and characterization of the responsible gall-inducing effectors and corresponding plant signaling pathway(s) are largely elusive. Here we reveal molecular components acting downstream of a group of plant TOPLESS (TPL)- corepressor interacting fungal effectors that are directly involved in gall formation. We classify these effectors into two classes based on distinct phenotypic responses when individually expressed in planta. While class I responses are characterized by leaf chlorosis, transgenic plants expressing class II TPL-interacting protein (Tip) effectors show a derepression of the AtARF7/AtARF19 branch of auxin signaling, resulting in pluripotent calli formation without the external addition of phytohormones. Subsequent comparative transcriptomics in maize also demonstrates a highly significant overlap of genes up-regulated during U. maydis-triggered leaf gall formation and during the developmental initiation of lateral root formation. This suggests that U. maydis can hijack the lateral root initiation pathway to induce galls in maize shoots. We demonstrate that underlying this is the transcriptional upregulation of downstream LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (LBD) transcription factors. Maize mutants in two LBD genes (ra2, rtcs) led to significantly reduced gall formation following U. maydis infection on homozygous mutants.

However, approaches and methods are needed to increase success rates and to elaborate designs. Here we describe the combination of rational and computational design to deliver three-helix bundle (3HB) peptide assemblies and single-chain proteins with control over topology and thermal stability. First, we garner sequence-to-structure relationships from antiparallel 3HBs in the Protein Data Bank. This gives core-packing rules, including layers of hydrogen-bonded polar residues, which are combined with surface-charge patterning to design complementary sequences for acidic (A), basic (B), and neutral (N) helices. By altering the design of the N helix, two sets of synthetic peptides are generated for clockwise and anticlockwise arrangements of the three-helix assemblies. Solution-phase characterization shows that both ABN peptide mixtures form stable, heterotrimeric assemblies consistent with the targeted up-down-up topologies. Next, AlphaFold2 models for both designs are used to seed computational designs of single-chain proteins where the helices are connected by loop building. Synthetic genes for these express in E. coli to yield soluble, monomeric, and thermally stable proteins. By systematically introducing additional polar layers within the core, the thermal stability of these proteins is varied without compromising the specificity of the helix-helix interactions. Chemical and thermal denaturation reveals comparable thermodynamic parameters to those of highly stable natural proteins. Four X-ray crystal structures confirm that the design models and AlphaFold2 predictions match to sub-[A] accuracy.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging, we monitored AHD motions in Gi proteins coupled to the -opioid receptor (OR) across a spectrum of ligand- and nucleotide-bound states. We find that receptor ligands differentially modulate these dynamics from over 70 angstrom away, with higher-efficacy agonists more effectively promoting transitions to an open, low-nucleotide-affinity conformation.

Spectrally resolved image stacks are used to extract pixel-wise optical thickness maps, from which physical thickness and refractive index can be derived. These parameters reveal nanoscale structural differences and offer routes to biophysical characterization.

The objective of this study was to identify genotypes that vary in Cd uptake and explore how domestication, saponins, and root-associated microbes could influence these differences. Twelve genotypes representing wild ancestors and modern landraces or cultivars from four distinct ecoregions were grown in a greenhouse trial using potting media amended with Cd. Differences in phenological developmental traits were recorded during growth, and plant biomass, microbial derived amino sugars in roots, and concentrations of Cd and other essential elements in grains were quantified at harvest. Phenological development of Ancestors were more adversely affected by Cd than modern genotypes, and Cd concentrations were higher in those developed later near coastal regions in South America and the United States, suggesting that quinoa become more tolerant over domestication and selection. Concentrations of several elements were also lower in the Ancestors vs. modern genotypes in response to Cd, indicating that modern genotypes may not downregulate root transporters as an adaptation to Cd stress. Fungal derived amino sugars were negatively correlated with Cd concentrations in the Coastal ecotypes which had the highest uptake, suggesting that the presence of root-associated fungi could help restrict translocation aboveground. Results of this study will provide breeders with new insights into factors that could aid in selecting for quinoa with low Cd-uptake.

RKNs are generalist herbivores with a wide host range including crop and wild plants. The latter are an important source of defensive metabolites that may be helpful for RKN management. Milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) produce toxic cardenolides that protect them from herbivory. However, it is unclear if cardenolides may defend milkweeds against RKNs. Here, we tested this directly through herbivory assays with the RKN M. incognita on milkweed species that produce negligible and high levels of cardenolides, A. tuberosa and A. curassavica, respectively. We found that M. incognita induces fewer galls on A. curassavica than A. tuberosa and fails to reproduce after reaching maturity on the former but not the latter species. This suggests that the predominantly polar cardenolides in A. curassavica may engender long-term reproductive toxicity. Further toxicity assays with the polar cardenolide ouabain showed that cardenolides can also have more immediate toxic effects on M. incognita at higher concentrations. Ouabain caused a coiled, paralytic phenotype in juvenile RKNs, a sign of neurotoxicity, leading to lethality in a subset of RKNs. Some nematodes recovered upon ouabain removal, confirming that neurotoxic cardenolides have a nematostatic effect that results in death when exposure persists. Taken together, our results provide further evidence that cardenolides may function as anti-herbivore defenses against RKNs. The dead end host plant A. curassaviva appears to possess useful properties that may be leveraged for control of RKNs in agriculture.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Asteraceae capitula are highly diverse but are thought to have evolved once via unknown mechanisms. During capitulum development, shoot stem cells undergo prolonged proliferation to accommodate the formation of intersecting spirals of flowers (florets) along the disk-shaped head9,10.

A better understanding of how future temperature conditions will disrupt dormancy in cultivated fruit trees is crucial for anticipating the impeding consequences and identifying potential adaptation strategies. We investigated the effect of very constrained temperature conditions, i.e. several levels of cold deprivation and early cold exposure, on sweet cherry flower buds during dormancy onset and maintenance, using phenological observations and transcriptomic analyses. We show that temperature is a major driver of dormancy progression as cold deprivation and early cold exposure strongly modify the timing of phenological phases as well as gene expression patterns. We identified genes and signaling pathways specifically activated and/or repressed by cold temperatures, and therefore potentially involved in the optimal progression of dormancy.

The integrity and fate of cells depend on the asymmetric makeup of lipid bilayers with various membrane proteins regulating the lipid composition of a bilayer's two leaflets. Lipids scramblases are one of the primary regulators of lipid asymmetry in bilayers, spontaneously transferring lipids between membrane leaflets. Members of the TMEM16, OSCA/TMEM63, and TMC families have been suggested to be lipid scramblases. Despite significant differences, these proteins share a common structural architecture that features a membrane-exposed groove. The \"credit card\" mechanism proposes that lipids switch leaflets by moving their polar head groups either inside (partially dry) or on the surface of (wet) membrane-exposed, open hydrophilic grooves. However, emerging evidence of closed-groove scrambling challenges this model. Given the sequence diversity of groove-lining amino acids in TMEM16, OSCA/TMEM63, and TMC proteins, we hypothesized that lipid scrambling is primarily determined by groove architecture. To test this hypothesis and the credit card mechanism, we used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of experimental structures and AlphaFold-generated models of six different scramblases in closed and open states. In these simulations, we observed little scramblase activity in most closed-state configurations but robust scrambling by all open-state models. We then built simplified TMEM16-based scramblases with only three bead types uniformly set for solvent-facing, transmembrane, and groove regions. We used this and further simplified models to vary groove surface hydrophilicity, groove surface geometry, and groove architecture. Our models support the partially dry and wet credit card mechanisms and suggest that groove architecture plays a more important role in facilitating lipid scrambling than the detailed sequence of groove-lining amino acids.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

An open question is whether long-distance transport can occur by mechanisms that do not require specific motor-cargo interactions and high processivity. In addition to conventional cargo such as vesicles, kinesin also shuttles non-motor microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to microtubule ends. Computational modeling of a system of a motor and a MAP that do not bind directly with one another unexpectedly revealed the redistribution of the MAP to microtubule plus ends, suggesting an unconventional mode of protein transport. We recapitulated this phenomenon experimentally in a minimal in vitro system using a kinesin-1 protein (K401) and PRC1, a non-motor MAP that binds diffusively on microtubules and shows no detectable binding to K401. Single-molecule imaging revealed unidirectional streams of PRC1 molecules over micron distances along microtubules. Our findings suggest that a stoichiometric excess of K401 can act as a unidirectional barrier to PRC1 diffusion. This effectively \"shepherds\" PRC1 to microtubule plus end without conventional motor-cargo interactions. Remarkably, we found that shepherding occurs with low kinesin processivity.

Every protein is introduced to the cellular environment from N- to C-terminus as it is synthesized, which can enable the N-terminus to begin folding before the C-terminus appears. Here we show that direction and speed of appearance alone can significantly affect whether a protein will fold to its native structure, versus misfold. This sensitivity demonstrates that folding energy landscapes are sufficiently rugged that conformations adopted by the first portion of the protein to appear can significantly impact subsequent folding steps. Despite high structural similarity, homologous proteins had different sensitivities to vectorial appearance, indicating the native topology is insufficient to determine contours of the energy landscape.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Although progress has been made with data-driven and intuition-based approaches, optimal CVs remain system-specific. Meanwhile, simple geometric descriptors are still widely used due to their transferability. A promising, yet under-explored, candidate for a more efficient CV is solvation. Indeed, despite its central role in ligand binding and folding, the complexity of solvent behavior has hindered its widespread use. Here, we introduce a data-driven and automatable strategy to construct robust solvation-based CVs. Our method identifies critical hydration sites by analyzing the radial distribution function of water around a ligand. Remarkably, using only these hydration CVs within on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling (OPES) simulations, we successfully converge the binding free energy landscapes for a series of host-guest systems. These landscapes show excellent agreement with those from more computationally expensive benchmark methods. We further demonstrate that the choice of where to bias water is key to efficient convergence, providing clear guidelines for implementation. This work not only underscores the central role of water in molecular recognition but also offers a powerful and generalizable framework for enhancing the sampling of complex biomolecular events.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

A.; Gu, Q.", "abstract": "Hypoxia underlies or complicates a wide range of chronic conditions, including cancer, arthritis, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, stroke, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and more. Research is presented supporting indications that slower-paced exercises may develop states of relaxation, combined with enhanced respiration, which may trigger accelerated diffusion and facilitated oxygen use in the cells, stimulating cellular regeneration and healing. Metarobic theory is proposed as a physiological explanation for the benefits of slower-paced exercises, and as a good fit with aerobic and anaerobic categories of exercise. Metarobic theory posits that the momentary post activity drop in blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) following slow-paced exercises, and intermittently during sleep, may be the result of increased oxygen diffusion and metabolism. Metarobic effects may explain the non-aerobic health benefits of slower paces of walking, tai chi, qigong, and other slow-paced exercises, as well as the healing benefits of sleep. Research from the current study is presented, which supports that the momentary large drops in SpO2 ranging from 85% to 92% (m=89.2%) following slower-paced exercises, and periodically during sleep, may indicate a shift in the use and metabolism of oxygen. It is suggested that the momentary drop in SpO2 may follow an accelerated period of oxygen diffusion in response to hypoxic areas of the body, and a need for enhanced healing and cellular regeneration. In relation to sleep, this contrasts to current theory that lower levels of SpO2 during sleep result from more shallow respiration, due to the body needing less oxygen during sleep, resulting in hypoxemia. The end effect of slow-paced exercises and sleep may be to reverse or moderate hypoxia in the body through metarobic effects including enhanced oxygen diffusion, supporting healing and cellular regeneration.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

We combined chemically imposed immune activation with single-cell transcriptomics to profile ETI responses across all leaf cell types in Arabidopsis. Despite uniform ETI perception, we find striking divergence between transcriptional outputs: a core set of defense genes is broadly induced, while distinct cell types activate specialized immune modules. We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens. Their absence permits pathogen entry into deeper tissues despite intact recognition, revealing a spatial division of immune functions.

During the past 15 years, surveillance has identified nove trichothecenes 3ANX and NX, which show increased virulence compared to DON. In this study, we investigated the effects of 15ADON/3ANX chemotype on both wheat and F. graminearum proteomes to identify proteins and pathways responsive to the emerging mycotoxin chemotype. We defined a core wheat proteome across all strains (15ADON- and 15ADON/3ANX-producing, and untreated controls) to explore changes in protein abundance associated with defense response, grain development, and reduced photosynthesis upon infection. Conversely, we identified 32 wheat proteins exclusively produced in the presence of 15ADON/3ANX strains, providing further insight into chemotype-specific responses of wheat. Additionally, assessment from the fungal perspective, reported 119 proteins exclusive to the 15ADON/3ANX strains, including those associated with virulence and mycotoxin production. Lastly, investigation of strain-specific proteome changes showed a significant reduction in mycotoxin protective mechanisms in wheat upon exposure to two 15ADON/3ANX strains, as well as a novel connection between elevated ergosterol biosynthesis and 15ADON/3ANX producing strains. Together, our study characterizes distinct protein production profiles in wheat and F. graminearum in response to 3ANX and provides evidence that these molecular changes influence fungal virulence and host defense responses.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Using a combined approach of serological analysis and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing, we investigated molecular features of the antibody response in four vaccinated individuals from a YFV-endemic region. Our results indicate that the booster induces a transient antibody response, with limited effect on the neutralization capacity against DENV1-4 and ZIKV. Notably, we observed a rapid clonal expansion of B cells within 14 days post-vaccination, predominantly involving IgA and IgG isotypes. However, this expansion was short-lived, with reduced magnitude and persistence of these lineages by day 28. Interestingly, some of the expanded lineages shared sequence similarity with previously characterized anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV antibodies, although further validation is required to assess their functional relevance and presence in circulating serum. Together, these findings highlight the transient nature and isotype composition of the antibody response following YFV revaccination and provide insights into the complex interplay between pre-existing immunity and recall responses in individuals living in endemic regions.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Given the gut microbiota's profound influence on liver pathophysiology, identifying specific bacterial factors that directly regulate hepatocyte mitophagy could unlock novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we identify bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN)-a conserved cell wall component-as a key activator of mitophagy that protects against hepatocyte death. Through both in vivo and in vitro studies, we demonstrate that either heat-killed Escherichia coli or purified PGN attenuates hepatocyte death. Mechanistically, PGN is internalized by hepatocytes, localizes to mitochondria, and initiates mitophagy via direct interaction with the autophagy adaptor p62/SQSTM1. Genetic ablation of p62 in hepatocytes completely abolishes PGN-induced mitophagy, underscoring the pathway's essential role. Strikingly, therapeutic administration of PGN markedly alleviates carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic fibrosis, reducing collagen deposition and suppressing hepatic stellate cell activation through enhanced autophagic flux.

GPCRs are known to signal through both heterotrimeric G proteins and {beta}-arrestins. Traditionally these pathways were viewed as largely separable, with G proteins primarily initiating downstream signaling while {beta}-arrestins modulate receptor trafficking and desensitization in addition to regulating their own signaling events. Recent studies suggest an integrated role of G proteins and {beta}-arrestins in GPCR signaling, however the cellular and biochemical requirements for G protein: {beta}-arrestin interactions remain unclear. Here we show that G proteins and {beta}-arrestins can directly interact. Through utilization of {beta}-arrestin-biased receptors and artificially enforced {beta}-arrestin relocalization, we demonstrate that recruitment of {beta}-arrestin to the plasma membrane is sufficient to interact with the G protein Gi. Using purified proteins, we show that Gi directly interacts with {beta}-arrestin. In addition, we find that Gi family members differ in their degree of association with {beta}-arrestin, and that a large degree of this selectivity resides within the alpha helical domain of Gi.

These vaccines present the unstructured central repeat region, as well as the C-terminal domain, of the circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (1). A recently discovered protective monoclonal antibody, L9, recognizes three structured copies of the PfCSP minor repeat. Similarly to other highly potent anti-malarial antibodies, L9 relies on critical homotypic interactions between antibodies for its high protective efficacy (2, 3). Here, we report the design of immunogens scaffolding one copy of PfCSP's minor repeat capable of binding L9. To design immunogens capable of presenting multiple, structure-based epitopes in one scaffold, we developed a machine-learning-driven structural immunogen design pipeline, MESODID, tailored to focus on multi-epitope vaccine targets. We use this pipeline to design multiple scaffolds that present three copies of the PfCSP minor repeat. A 3.6 [A] cryo-EM structure of our top design, minor repeat targeting immunogen (M-TIM), demonstrates that M-TIM successfully orients three copies of L9, effectively recapitulating its critical homotypic interactions. The wide prevalence of repeated epitopes in key vaccine targets, such as HIV-1 Envelope, SARS-CoV-2 spike, and Influenza Hemagglutinin, suggests that MESODID will have broad utility in creating immunogens that incorporate such epitopes, offering a new powerful approach to developing vaccines against a range of challenging infections, including malaria.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

While the dynamics of the hydration shell have been described by spectroscopic techniques, the structure of the hydration shell remain less understood due to the lack of hydration shell-sensitive structural probes with high spatial resolution. We combined temperature-ramp small-angle X-ray scattering (T-ramp SAXS) from 255--335 K with molecular simulations to show that the hydration shells of the GB3 domain and villin headpiece are remarkably temperature-sensitive. For proteins in the folded state, T-ramp SAXS data and explicit-solvent SAXS predictions consistently demonstrate decays of protein contrasts and radii of gyration with increasing temperature, which are shown to reflect predominantly temperature-sensitive depleting hydration shells. The depletion is not merely caused by enhanced disorder within the hydration shells but also by partial displacements of surface-coordinated water molecules.

Foods and beverages contain plastic particles from environmental contamination and processing and packaging materials, which are frequently made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Micro- and nanoplastics have been detected in human tissues such as the brain, liver, and placenta, as well as in ovarian follicular fluid, but little is known about the effects nanoplastics have on the female reproductive system. In addition, few studies on the health impacts of nanoplastics have been performed using environmentally relevant plastic types and concentrations. Thus, this research tested the hypothesis that nanoplastics made of spherical polystyrene (PS), a common model nanoplastic, would have different effects on cultured mouse ovarian follicles compared to secondary PET nanoplastics at environmentally relevant doses. The ovary is a highly sensitive reproductive organ responsible for the development of follicles, which contain the oocyte, and production of steroid hormones. Follicles were harvested from adult mouse ovaries and cultured for 96 h with vehicle, spherical commercially available 200 nm PS nanoplastics (1-100 g/mL), or lab-generated 240 nm PET nanoplastics (0.1-10 g/mL). PS and PET nanoplastic exposure inhibited follicle growth and altered expression of genes related to steroid synthesis, cell cycle, and oxidative stress. PET nanoplastics increased levels of pregnenolone and decreased expression of Cyp17a1. Overall, both plastic types altered ovarian function, but they impacted different genes in similar pathways. These findings suggest that nanoplastic exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations may pose a risk to female reproductive health by disrupting hormonal and molecular pathways.

However, the effects of RMT on sleep and cardiovascular parameters have not been investigated in non-clinical populations. Methods: This prospective study investigated the effects of combined inspiratory and expiratory RMT (cRMT) on sleep parameters and cardiovascular biometrics, specifically heart rate variability (HRV), in a non-clinical adult cohort. Utilizing a wearable device for remote data collection, this randomized controlled trial included 67 participants divided into good and poor sleeper groups based on historical sleep data. During a five-week intervention period, participants in the intervention group underwent cRMT using a Breather Fit device, while control group participants did not receive the intervention. Results: Study findings demonstrate a significant increase in overnight HRV metrics during the intervention period compared to the baseline, indicating improved autonomic cardiac function. However, no significant changes were observed in any parameters of sleep quality.

In this study, we examined the variation in root morphology in two contrasting raspberry cultivars, Latham (PRR resistant) and Glen Moy (PRR susceptible). We performed RNA-sequencing on Latham roots challenged with P. rubi, to study the transcriptomic response and uncover mechanisms underpinning resistance. We established a new raspberry reference transcript dataset that allowed quantification of raspberry root gene expression. Transcripts significantly upregulated in Latham challenged with P. rubi, included many with characterised roles in resistance, such as Pathogenesis-related proteins and a Germin-like protein, designated RiABP19. The homologous Glen Moy RiABP19 gene showed no differential transcriptional response to PRR infection, indicating a resistance cultivar-specific induction signature following PRR challenge. Three-dimensional structural modelling predicts that RiABP19 contains conserved active sites implicated in auxin-binding and superoxide dismutase activity and can form a homo-hexamer like true germins. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that RiABP19 can form both homo- and heterodimers in planta.

In this study, we investigated genomic diversity among over 1000 cassava genotypes, with a particular focus on the addition of 387 newly sequenced landrace varieties originating from diverse climates across Colombia. As cassava was domesticated in or near the Amazon basin, these landraces represent untapped genetic diversity that could be used to help improve modern varieties. As theory predicts, we found that landraces retain high genetic diversity, observing variation lacking in breeding lines from Asia and Africa, where introductions likely caused population bottlenecks. Genetic differentiation in landraces reflects both space and climate of origin, suggesting the combined effects of demography and selection. To identify alleles with the potential to inform targets for gene editing, we assessed the diversity of loss-of-function (LoF) mutations across these landraces. We found evidence that deleterious LoF alleles were purged by inbreeding. Notably, genes retaining LoF alleles despite inbreeding were significantly enriched for functions related to the biosynthesis of coumarins and the regulation of plant immunity, suggesting selection on postharvest quality and disease resistance. We further identified specific loci associated with climates of origin, motivating future experiments using targeted knockouts to test hypotheses about the adaptive value of specific LoF alleles.

Wats.). However, field-scale implementation of this method requires a carrier for pollen delivery, as applying pure pollen on a large scale is not practical. Additionally, variability in flowering time within and among individual plants may impact the technique's effectiveness. Mass pollination may also lead to a female-biased sex ratio in the progeny, a phenomenon known as certation. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to: (1) identify a suitable dry (inert) diluent and the most effective pollen-to-diluent ratio for large-scale application, and (2) determine the most effective combination of initiation time, frequency, and number of sterile pollen applications, and 3) test for evidence of certation in A. palmeri. Plants were grown in the greenhouse in summer 2021. Sterilized pollen irradiated at 300 Gy was mixed with talc or wheat powder flour, respectively, at six v/v ratios (pollen%/powder%) of 0/100 (powder alone), 5/95, 10/90, 25/75, 50/50, or 100/0 (pure irradiated pollen). An equal amount of the pollen-diluent powder mixture was then brushed onto the standardized lengths of inflorescence of receptive female plants. Flower and seed number on each inflorescence was counted and used to calculate seed set in each treatment. The findings showed that a minimum of 25% irradiated pollen in the mixture, either with talc powder or wheat flour, can effectively reduce seed set in A. palmeri. Building on this, a second round of greenhouse experiments was conducted in fall 2021, where female plants were pollinated with a 25% irradiated pollen and talc powder mixture using a powder duster. Pollination treatments were initiated at different times after anthesis (7, 14, and 21 days), and the number of applications varied (once, twice, or three times) with intervals of one, two, or three weeks between applications. The greatest reduction in seed output was achieved when sterile pollen application began seven days after anthesis and was repeated three times at 7-day intervals. Evidence of certation was also observed in A. palmeri, with the progeny of mass-pollinated females showing a higher female ratio (58%) compared to the open-pollinated population (47%). Mass pollination also led to a slight, though not statistically significant, reduction in plant size traits such as height and number of branches, providing an additional potential benefit of the sterile pollen technique.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the neuropathological effects of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and H5N8 strains in a mouse model. Although viral RNA was detected in the brain post-infection, no viral proteins were found, suggesting limited or transient brain replication. Despite this, infected brains showed significant neuronal damage, including axonal loss and nuclear condensation, as evidenced by immunofluorescence and Nissl staining. We also observed pathological changes in TDP-43, including conformational alterations and increased phosphorylation, which required antigen retrieval for detection, features reminiscent of those found in frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [4, 5]. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed strain-specific host responses, including activation of interferon-related genes and downregulation of microtubule-associated pathways. These findings suggest that IAV infection can trigger hallmarks of neurodegeneration in the absence of persistent viral protein expression, possibly through host-driven mechanisms.

Current guidelines rely primarily on aortic diameter for intervention; however, many dissections occur without severe dilation. Mechanical properties, such as elastic modulus have emerged as potential predictors of disease progression; nonetheless, noninvasive clinical applications remain limited. To evaluate the relationship between the computed tomography (CT)-derived elastic modulus of the ascending aorta and the histopathological characteristics of the aortic media. Methods: Thirty patients who underwent surgical replacement of the ascending aorta were included in this study. Preoperative CT was used to calculate the aortic elastic modulus based on geometric measurements and pulse pressure. Resected aortic specimens were subjected to histological and immunohistochemical analyses to assess elastin, collagen, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and smoothelin expression. Correlation analyses between the CT-derived elastic modulus and aortic media composition were conducted after adjusting for age and aortic diameter. Results: The CT-derived elastic modulus exhibited a significant negative correlation with elastin area (r2 = 0.75, p < .01) and a positive correlation with collagen area (r2 = 0.61, p < .01). Additionally, a moderate negative correlation was observed between the elastic modulus and elastin fiber waviness (r2 = 0.27, p < .01). Although no significant correlation was found between the total VSMCs content and the elastic modulus, a strong negative correlation was detected between the elastic modulus and the proportion of contractile-type (smoothelin-positive) VSMCs (r2 = 0.74, p < .01). These findings remained significant after adjusting for confounders. Conclusions: CT-derived elastic modulus of the ascending aorta reflects the underlying pathological changes, including extracellular matrix remodeling and VSMC phenotypic modulation. Noninvasive assessment of aortic mechanical properties may provide novel insights into aortic disease progression and therapeutic responses.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Indeed, large screens have revealed extensive microbial metabolism of drugs in vitro, but the pharmacologic and clinical repercussions of microbiota-mediated metabolism in vivo remain to be discerned. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate how human gut microbes contribute to in vivo pharmacology and efficacy of a key anti-inflammatory drug, methotrexate (MTX). Specifically, we demonstrate that the gut microbiome shapes drug pharmacology in vivo in mice, both by directly metabolizing the drug and by inducing host pathways that promote drug metabolism. Moreover, interindividual variation in the human gut microbiome contributes to variation in pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. When we quantified metabolites produced by microbes, we unexpectedly identified novel MTX metabolites, one of which, p-methylaminobenzoyl-L-glutamic acid (pMABG), was a major byproduct of microbial metabolism both in vitro and in vivo. Further, we find that a large proportion of patient-associated microbes are capable of metabolizing MTX. Finally, we show that microbial metabolism of MTX is linked to PK profiles and disease outcomes in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that the human gut microbiome causally contributes to drug pharmacology in vivo for a key anti-inflammatory drug through known and novel mechanisms. Our studies provide a framework for elucidating the clinical relevance of drug microbial metabolism in the context of treatment response. These results are a first step towards understanding and manipulating the human gut microbiome in the treatment of autoimmunity and the advancement of precision medicine for millions of patients taking MTX for immune or inflammatory conditions.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

However, the developmental trajectory during the adolescent years is understudied and the underlying neural correlates of pragmatic development are unknown. In this study, we used an established fMRI paradigm contrasting indirect and direct speech act processing in a newly acquired adolescent sample (n = 51) and a previously collected adult sample (n = 57). The adolescent sample was split into two groups: Young (ages 13-15) and Mid (ages 16-18); and the adult sample (Old, ages 18-36) into two groups based on pragmatic skill level, established in separate behavioral tests. We observed increased activity with age in the posterior medial prefrontal cortex, and a combination of age-related differences and individual differences in adults in the left posterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the posterior cingulate cortex. These clusters were all located outside of the classical perisylvian language areas (\"the language network\"). The posterior cingulate cortex cluster overlapped with core nodes of the DMN network. We interpret the IPS finding in terms of its overlap with two relevant networks (one of them is the \"multiple demand\" network related to cognitive control). The results indicate that young adolescents and adults with low pragmatic skill may be over-interpreting direct speech acts as potentially indirect. The similarity between these two groups across results in turn indicate that a delayed adolescent development may lead to persistent difficulties in adulthood. We have shown that aspects of pragmatic development depend on cognitive abilities other than language and Theory of Mind. By studying adolescence, a presumably uniquely human extended developmental period, we provide a rare empirical angle on the question of which aspects of brain and cultural evolution contributed to the human communicative faculty.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Most zoonotic S. suis infections globally are by strains from lineage CC1 carrying a serotype 2 capsule. However, in Thailand, ~40% of the reported zoonotic infections are caused by two endemic lineages, CC104 and CC233 which also have a serotype 2 capsule. In this study, we aimed to identify the drivers of the emergence and recent evolution of these two lineages. Methods: We sequenced the whole genomes of 141 Thai S. suis zoonotic and porcine strains isolated over a 15-year period and combined them with a curated global dataset of 2761 published S. suis genomes. Using comparative genomics, Bayesian evolutionary models and multivariate analysis we investigated the emergence of zoonotic potential and multi-drug resistance in CC104 and CC233. Findings: We estimated recent emergence dates for both CC104 (1990; 95% posterior: 1987-1992) and CC233 (2002; 95% posterior: 2000-2004). Both lineages acquired a serotype capsule 2 from CC1 through a capsule locus switching event, prior to their emergence. Both have also experienced multiple antimicrobial resistance (AMR) acquisition events, with some strains carrying 12 determinants encoding resistance against eight classes of antibiotics. Most importantly, CC104 and CC233 lineages are the first zoonotic lineages to have acquired increased resistance to penicillin and ceftriaxone, which form the standard therapy to treat S. suis infections in humans. Interpretation: Horizontal transfer of multiple genomic regions can cause rapid emergence of novel multi-drug-resistant zoonotic S. suis lineages. As S. suis is mainly controlled and treated through the use of antibiotics in both pigs and humans, these findings highlight the urgent need for improved and enhanced surveillance, infection control, and treatments.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

R. solani is classified into reproductively incompatible anastomosis groups (AGs). In the vegetative stage, most plant-pathogenic R. solani isolates are multinuclear and heterokaryotic, but little was previously known about the diversity between haplotypes due to highly fragmented, collapsed short-read assemblies. We present fully-phased, chromosome-scale genome assemblies of the broad host-range R. solani isolates AG8-1 and AG8-3. We demonstrate that both AG8 isolates have two distinct haplotypes, each of which is ~50 Mbp spread across 16 chromosomes and use PacBio Iso-Seq data to achieve a high-quality gene annotation. We show that the two nuclear haplotypes display high heterozygosity and differences in haplotype abundance in vegetative cultures. Using transcriptome sequencing during infection of three types of host plants, we show that the less abundant haplotype in both AG8-1 and AG8-3 harbour more genes up-regulated during infection.

Yet, the causes of this stepwise expansion remain poorly understood. Here, using mathematical modeling and stochastic simulations, we show that recombination suppression can expand simply due to the widespread presence of deleterious recessive mutations in genomes. We demonstrate that a significant proportion of new inversions are initially advantageous because they carry fewer mutations than average. However, these less-loaded inversions generally fail to fix on autosomes because, as their frequency increases, the recessive deleterious mutations they carry are more likely to occur in a homozygous state, leading to a selective disadvantage. In contrast, the permanent heterozygosity of Y-like sex chromosomes shelters sex-linked inversions from this disadvantage, facilitating their fixation and thereby the stepwise expansion of non-recombining regions. We show that this sheltering effect leads to fixation probabilities exceeding those expected under drift alone. Once recombination is suppressed, deleterious mutations accumulate on inversions, which could select for recombination restoration. However, we show that the accumulation of overlapping genomic rearrangements following recombination suppression can prevent its restoration. Our theoretical model proposes a simple and testable framework explaining evolutionary strata on sex and mating-type chromosomes, and other supergenes.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

To address this issue, we used a novel, variant-specific back-projection model to estimate a distribution of likely infection times from sample collection times. We combined this approach with epidemiological modeling to estimate selection for increased transmission in a way that accounts for the uncertainty in infection times. Tests in simulations demonstrated that our method can make the inference of selection more reliable.

Here, we show that thermophilic viruses have appropriated the SAVED domain of CalpL as an anti-CRISPR, AcrIII-2, which they use to degrade cA4. AcrIII-2 dimers sandwich cA4, degrading it in a shared active site to short linear products, using a mechanism highly reminiscent of CalpL. This results in inhibition of a range of cA4 activated effectors in vitro.

Bacteria in this latter phase are generally more resistant to antibiotics and are often responsible for recurrent infections. A comprehensive understanding of metabolic processes in both the exponential and stationary phases of bacterial growth could facilitate the development of phase-specific antibiotics. In this study, we adopted an untargeted proteomics approach to establish similarities and differences in the exponential and stationary phase proteome landscapes in BLR (DE3) cells, an Escherichia coli B strain. Our findings are consistent with previous studies, which show that metabolic processes such as translation and ribosome biogenesis decrease during the stationary phase compared to the fast-growing exponential phase, whereas tricarboxylic acid cycle activity increases.

WHO reports a total of 778 million registered SARS-CoV-2 infections as of June 2025. Recent studies indicate that as many as 25% of COVID patients will experience at least one symptom of Long COVID. Long COVID pathophysiology is a complex and not fully established process. One prevailing theory is that the formation of fibrin amyloid microclots (fibrinaloids), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, can induce persistent inflammation and capillary blockage. An association between the amyloidogenic Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and impaired fibrinolysis has previously been made when it was observed that fibrin clots formed in the presence of a mixture of amyloid fibrils from the spike protein displayed a resistance to plasmin-mediated lysis. Here we investigated the molecular processes of impaired fibrinolysis using seven amyloidogenic SARS-COV-2 Spike peptides. Five out of seven Spike amyloid fibrils appeared not to substantially interfere with the fibrinogen-fibrin-fibrinolysis process in vitro, while two spike fibrils were active in different ways. Spike601 amyloid fibrils (sequence 601-620) impaired thrombin mediated fibrin formation by binding and sequestering fibrinogen but did not affect fibrinolysis. On contrary fibrin clots formed in the presence of Spike685 amyloid fibrils (sequence 685-701) exhibited a marked resistance to plasmin mediated fibrinolysis. We conclude that Spike685 amyloid fibrils can induce dense fibrin clot networks, as well as incorporate fibrin into aggregated structures that resist fibrinolysis.

Towards this, we are developing an ensemble of compliant micromechanisms that enables diverse modes of cell manipulation on a single chip.

Since the mechanism transforms motion using deformation, cell stretching forces can be estimated through image-based displacement measurements, without additional sensing modalities, considerably simplifying the device fabrication and operation.

In this study, we employed a multi-scale approach integrating structural analysis, hierarchical molecular simulations, mutational scanning and network-based allosteric modeling to dissect how Class 4 antibodies (represented by S2X35, 25F9, and SA55) and Class 5 antibodies (represented by S2H97, WRAIR-2063 and WRAIR-2134) can modulate conformational behavior, binding energetics, allosteric interactions and immune escape patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using hierarchical simulations of the antibody complexes with the spike protein and ensemble-based mutational scanning of binding interactions we showed that these antibodies through targeting conserved cryptic sites can exert allosteric effects that influence global conformational dynamics in the RBD functional regions. The ensemble-based mutational scanning of binding interactions revealed an excellent agreement with experimentally derived deep mutational scanning (DMS) data accurately recapitulating the known binding hotspots and escape mutations across all studied antibodies. The predicted destabilization values in functional sites are consistent with experimentally observed reductions in antibody binding affinity and immune escape profiles demonstrating that computational models can robustly reproduce and forecast mutation-induced immune escape trends. Using dynamic network modeling we characterized the antibody-induced changes in residue interaction networks and long-range interactions. The results revealed that class 4 antibodies can exhibit distinct patterns of allosteric influence despite targeting overlapping regions, while class 5 antibodies elicit consistently dense and broadly distributed allosteric networks and long-range stabilization of the RBD conformations. Dynamic network analysis identifies a conserved allosteric network core that mediates long-range interactions and incudes antibody specific allosteric extensions that connect the binding interface hotspots with allosteric hubs. This study suggests that mechanisms of binding and immune escape for classes of antibodies targeting cryptic binding sites may be determined by confluence of multiple factors including high-affinity binding and long-range allosteric effects that modulate RBD adaptability and propagation of dynamic constraints which can influence mechanisms of viral evolution and escape.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Current standard therapies remain largely ineffective, reinforcing the need for novel targets to improve glioblastoma prognosis. Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is an important hallmark of cancer, marked by a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis as the primary energy source. This metabolic switch, known as the Warburg effect, is exacerbated by the reduced oxygen and glucose availability in the tumour microenvironment. The sweet taste receptor (STR) is an important glucosensor with recognised role in the regulation of glucose uptake in several organs and in astrocytes, the glioblastoma precursor cells. We hypothesised that STR may regulate glucose uptake and metabolism in glioblastoma, representing a potential anticancer target. To test this, we investigated the effects of STR inhibition with lactisole, a specific TAS1R3 inhibitor, in three glioblastoma cell lines (U-87MG, SNB-19 and U-373MG) and in the UPCI-SCC-154 tongue cancer cell line. We provided evidence that STR inhibition consistently reduced cell viability and migration, without inducing apoptosis or necrosis, and impaired glucose uptake and L-lactate production, particularly in tongue cancer UPCI-SCC-154, and glioblastoma U-87MG and SNB-19 cells. Moreover, in a 3D spheroid model, lactisole reduced the invasion capacity of U-87MG glioblastoma spheroids.

Despite this, the role of miRNAs in HRV infection is not yet well established. This study aimed to analyse the impact of HRV16 on miRNA expression across five time points of infection (2, 6, 15, 18, and 24hrs) and identify miRNAs that show altered expression across the life cycle and their target genes. Our experiments used both Hep2 and HeLa-Ohio cell lines to assess miRNA expression in a range of cell types, and a computer program was developed to assess the miRNAs gene targets and their involvement in HRV16 infection to narrow down potential biomarkers for HRV16. Our results showed that miR-155-5p, miR-140-3p, and miR-122-5p could represent potential biomarkers across the time course of HRV16 infection, showing strong differential expression, in multiple cell types. Furthermore, our program linked these miRNAs to four genes (OLFML3, STAG2, SMARCA2, CD40LG) that are play important roles in regulating the hosts antiviral responses and viral progression, with altered expression of these potentially correlating with infection severity.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

However, the effects of acute stressors on the gut microbiota, and how these interact with host stress responses, are less well understood. Here, we show that acute exposure of wild-derived mice (Mus musculus domesticus) to predator odor altered the composition of the gut microbiota, which in turn predicted host behavior. We experimentally tested the individual and combined effects of brief (15-minute) exposure to synthetic fox fecal odor and prolonged (4-week) social isolation, a well-established chronic stress paradigm. Leveraging behavioral assays, transcriptomics of visceral adipose tissue, and analyses of 3,500 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) generated from our data, we found significant effects of predator odor on host behavior, gene expression, and gut microbiota. Gut microbial communities and host gene expression profiles responded more strongly to brief predator-odor exposure than to prolonged social isolation. The relative abundances of predator odor-responsive bacterial species, including members of the Muribaculaceae and Lachnospiraceae, measured a week after a single predator-odor exposure were associated with host phenotypes assessed the following week, namely grooming and social behaviors and the expression of genes involved in anti-microbial defense, even after accounting for the effects of the stressors. Using random forest classifiers, we found that variation in gut-microbiota composition significantly predicted variation in behavior within treatment groups.

Here, we demonstrate the crucial role of the bacterial Hsp90 chaperone in the production of two major virulence factors, the colibactin genotoxin in Escherichia coli and the pyoverdine siderophore in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Colibactin, a hybrid polyketide/non-ribosomal peptide (PK-NRP), and pyoverdine, a non-ribosomal peptide (NRP), are metabolites produced by complex biosynthetic pathways involving large cytoplasmic enzymes called megasynthases. Using comparative proteomics, we found that megasynthase abundance was markedly reduced in hsp90 deletion mutants of E. coli and P. aeruginosa compared to wild-type strains. This reduction was independent of transcriptional or translational regulation. We further revealed an interplay between Hsp90 and the HslUV protease in controlling megasynthase levels. Remarkably, we found that Hsp90 stabilizes additional NRP and PK-NRP megasynthases, suggesting a general role for Hsp90 as a chaperone of these enzymes.

Hence, we aimed at a comprehensive assessment of the Roseobacter group in the global oceans on the basis of MAGs and SAGs. The obtained 610 MAGs and 43 SAGs of high quality were subjected to in-depth analyses of their phylogeny, genomic and functional features. The recruitment locations range from the tropics to polar regions, include all major ocean basins. The phylogenetic analysis delineated the known RCA cluster and five pelagic clusters, two of which were completely novel: TCR (Temperate and Cold Roseobacter), AAPR (Arctic-Atlantic-Pacific Roseobacter, novel), AAR (Arctic-Atlantic Roseobacter, novel), COR (Central Oceanic Roseobacter), LUX (Cand.

The TCR, AAPR, AAR and LUX clusters are among the most deeply branching lineages of the Roseobacter group. These clusters and several sublineages of the RCA and COR clusters exhibit distinct features of genome streamlining, i.e. genome sizes of <2.9 Mbp and G+C contents of <40%. The clusters exhibit differences in their functional features and also compared to other lineages of the Roseobacter group.

An important mechanism of miRNA regulation is target-directed microRNA degradation (TDMD), a pathway in which the binding of miRNAs to specialized trigger RNAs induces ubiquitylation and decay of associated Argonaute (AGO) proteins by the ZSWIM8 ubiquitin ligase. Concomitant release of miRNAs results in their rapid turnover. ZSWIM8-deficient mice exhibit reduced body size, cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental defects, and perinatal lethality. Despite widespread dysregulation of miRNAs in these animals, the vast majority of presumptive trigger RNAs that induce decay of ZSWIM8-regulated miRNAs remain undefined. Here, using AGO crosslinking and sequencing of hybrids (AGO-CLASH), a high-throughput method for identifying miRNA binding sites, we report the identification of Plagl1 as a TDMD trigger for miR-322-5p, and Lrrc58 and Malat1 as TDMD triggers for miR-503-5p in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In mice, deletion of the miR-322-5p and miR-503-5p trigger sites in the Plagl1 and Lrrc58 3' UTRs, respectively, abrogated TDMD of these miRNAs and resulted in miR-322/503-dependent embryonic growth restriction, recapitulating a key feature of the Zswim8-/- phenotype.

While the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) proposes a universal scaling of metabolic rate with body mass, recent evidence shows that this relationship is not fixed. Environmental factors like temperature and predation can alter the metabolic scaling exponent, potentially reshaping size distribution. However, most research has examined these patterns within individual species, leaving open questions about how environmental drivers affect scaling at the community level. To address this, we performed a mesocosm experiment manipulating both temperature and fish predator presence in freshwater macroinvertebrate communities. We found that metabolic scaling at the community level is highly responsive to environmental context: warming steepened the scaling exponent in predator-free tanks but flattened it when predators were present. This suggests that larger individuals reduce their baseline metabolic rates under predation risk, especially at higher temperatures. Interestingly, the slope of the community size distribution remained stable across treatments, indicating that shifts in metabolic scaling occurred independently of changes in size structure. Together, these findings highlight the environmental sensitivity of metabolic scaling and suggest that links between metabolism scaling and size distribution may be more complex than MTE predicts.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

M.; Belevich, I.; Jokitalo, E.; Seppa, P.; Helantera, H.", "abstract": "Dispersal evolution and social evolution are interlinked. Dispersal is necessary for avoiding kin competition and inbreeding, but limited dispersal also allows beneficial social interactions with kin. In ants, a correlation between poor dispersal and complex societies, where a big proportion of queens are philopatric, is well documented, but the underlying causal mechanisms are not clear. In this study we investigate the dispersal ability of six Formica species that vary in their colony queen number and nest founding mode, from three different subgenera. Investigating resource allocation in the bodies of young queens and males allows us to analyze the evolutionary causalities between dispersal ability and social organization. We measured the body ratios including wing-muscle ratio; glycogen, triglyceride and protein resources with colorimetric assays; and microscopic wing muscle structures with transmission electron microscopy, with an overall sample size of 1515 individual males and queens. Our results suggest that the physical condition of individuals does not strongly correlate with the dispersal patterns of the species, contrary to assumptions based on earlier studies in both ants and other insects. There was still a minor effect of social organization on male wing-muscle ratio, which is an interesting case of sexual coevolution of dispersal traits: it is likely that the queen philopatric behavior is reflected in male behavior and consequently in male morphology - even when our overall results support the hypothesis that ant dispersal is male biased regardless of social organization. Further, our intraspecific analyses in two of the six species reveal different patterns in their flight abilities in connection to their social organization, further pointing towards a mismatch between dispersal behavior and ability. In Formica queens, philopatry seems to be a behavioral trait of the individuals rather than a consequence of colony-level resource allocation into dispersal ability, pointing towards a behavior first evolutionary route. The queens may selfishly choose not to disperse even when their society provides them with the resources for it. This raises new questions about conflicts over dispersal in these highly social systems.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Among these, serine 500 (S500) has been identified as a key phosphorylation site targeted by both eEF-2K and PKA. However, the influence of this post-translational modification on the properties of eEF-2K has remained unclear. Prior studies have shown that S500 phosphorylation accelerates autophosphorylation of eEF-2K at its primary activating site, threonine 348 (T348). Here, we demonstrate that S500 phosphorylation, mimicked by a S500D mutation, works in conjunction with T348 phosphorylation to enhance the intrinsic (CaM-independent) activity of eEF-2K. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry reveals that CaM binding, and consequent enhancement in eEF-2K activity, is accompanied by conformational changes proximal to S500. Deletion of S500 and surrounding residues mimics the effects of S500D, promoting robust CaM-independent activity. These data suggest that CaM binding or S500 phosphorylation have similar effects, likely relieving an inhibitory constraint to enhance activity. Further, S500 phosphorylation enhances binding to both apo-CaM and Calcium/CaM, suggesting a mechanism for maintaining basal activity and priming the kinase for rapid reactivation in response to Calcium transients. These findings support a model in which phosphorylation on T348 and S500 synergize to stabilize the active conformation of eEF-2K.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Chemically modified PNAs capable of forming stable triplex structures with double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) under near-physiological conditions further expand their utility by enabling sequence-specific precise targeting and probing of functional RNA structural motifs. However, the presence of inverted Watson-Crick pairs (C-G and U-A) may significantly weaken the triplex formation of the dsRNA-binding PNAs (dbPNAs). Our previous work demonstrated that dbPNA P3 (composed of L, T, and Q monomers for the recognition of G-C, A-U, and C-G base pairs, respectively) can stimulate ribosomal frameshifting by binding to rHP2, a model RNA hairpin structure in an mRNA, albeit with suboptimal efficiency, due to its significantly weakened Q C-G triple formation. We hypothesize that incorporating s2U adjacent to Q may offer unique stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions facilitating the development of isoenergetic dbPNA-based probes binding toward dsRNAs with varied sequences. In this study, we investigate how incorporating s2U adjacent to Q residues in P3 influences its binding to rHP2. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) and non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analyses demonstrate that substituting T with s2U at the N-terminal position adjacent to Q (P3-2QT) enhances binding affinity by ~10-fold compared to unmodified P3, whereas C-terminal substitution (P3-TQ2) yields only a 2-fold improvement. Consistent with these findings, a cell-free dual-luciferase reporter assay reveals that P3-2QT significantly increases ribosomal frameshifting efficiency compared to P3 and P3-TQ2. Molecular dynamics simulations further indicate that P3-2QT maintains enhanced PNA-PNA stacking stability, particularly between s2U3 and Q4, suggesting a structural basis for its superior activity. Intriguingly, analogous s2U substitution in the P5 oligomer with the Q replaced by L does not confer a comparable enhancement in binding to the target RNA (rHP1) and frameshifting stimulation, highlighting the context-dependent nature of this modification. To assess the broader applicability of the s2U-Q motif, we examined its effect in dbPNAs targeting the RNA panhandle structure of influenza virus A and precursor microRNA-21, respectively. Both PAGE and BLI data confirm that s2U incorporation improves binding affinity, reinforcing the generality of this strategy. These findings underscore the potential of sequence-dependent uracil thiolation in optimizing triplex-forming dsRNA-binding PNAs, warranting further exploration of modified nucleobase designs to enhance their binding and functional properties.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Unlike traditional assessments that rely on regular walking patterns, we used external perturbations to uncover hidden balance mechanisms that may not appear during steady-state walking. We identified key kinematic balance features, including the anterior-posterior distance between the center of mass and the center of pressure, whole-body angular momentum in the frontal and sagittal planes, and vertical center of mass position and acceleration, which encode significant balance information and enhance the sensitivity of the metric. These features reinforce the importance of foot placement, inverted pendulum dynamics, push-off control, and trunk motion to maintain human balance. The perturbation recovery time metric effectively identified subtle balance changes caused by controlled artificial impairments of sensing, actuation, and consistency. These findings demonstrate that the recovery process following external walking perturbations encodes critical information for quantifying human balance, offering a promising approach for early detection of balance impairments.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

It inhibits growth by disrupting essential iron-dependent processes. However, Escherichia coli are naturally less sensitive to gallium than many other bacteria, and the mechanisms that control gallium tolerance are not completely understood. We performed a genome-wide transposon sequencing (TnSeq) screen to identify genes important for the survival of an extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli isolate (M12) in gallium nitrate. The TnSeq results indicated that inactivation of enterobactin siderophore-related genes (entS, fepD, fes, fepB) enhances bacterial survival in gallium, while disrupting the ferric dicitrate transport system increases susceptibility. We validated these findings through targeted gene knockouts and gallium sensitivity experiments. Our findings suggest that enterobactin can complex with gallium for cellular uptake, but that the ferric citrate receptor FecA can discriminate between gallium citrate and iron citrate. Expression of fecA increased with gallium exposure, showing that gallium induces FecA-mediated iron uptake. Gallium also increased intracellular levels of manganese in the {Delta}fecA strain. Supplementation with iron or manganese restored growth of M12 {Delta}fecA in gallium, suggesting that gallium sensitivity is linked to both iron starvation and oxidative stress.

The ATP-dependent chaperone Hsp90 is present from bacteria to eukaryotes, where it stabilizes and activates a wide range of substrate proteins called clients. However, what determines whether a protein depends on Hsp90 remains an open question. Here, we focused on the bacterial chaperone Hsp90 and its obligate client TilS (referred to as TilSSo) in the bacterium Shewanella oneidensis. Although Hsp90 is indispensable in S. oneidensis under heat stress by protecting the essential protein TilSSo from degradation by the protease HslUV, Hsp90 is dispensable in Escherichia coli, suggesting that E. coli TilS (TilSEc) is Hsp90 independent. We therefore compared the TilS orthologs with respect to in vitro stability, in vivo degradation, and interaction with Hsp90 to identify the determinants of the Hsp90 dependence. We found that in contrast to TilSSo, TilSEc was more stable, was not degraded by protease in the absence of Hsp90, and did not interact with Hsp90, indicating that TilSEc is not a client of Hsp90. Chimeras between TilSSo and TilSEc as well as directed mutagenesis revealed a region of TilSSo that is key for protease degradation and Hsp90 protection. Consistent with these results, the growth of S. oneidensis producing TilSEc was no longer dependent on Hsp90 under heat stress. Conversely, Hsp90 became essential for the growth of E. coli that produced TilSSo instead of TilSEc.

S.; BANERJEE, S.; Sahu, B. S.", "abstract": "This study reveals new insights into the role of the Adaptor protein (AP-3) complex in dense core vesicle function. Despite numerous studies, an existing knowledge lacuna in the role of AP-3 in DCV function prompted us to delve deeper. Advanced microscopy and biochemical analysis revealed compromised DCV exocytosis in AP-3-depleted PC12 cells and C. elegans. AP-3 depletion altered the size and positioning of DCVs. Golgi defects and RUSH (Retention under Selective Hook) substantiated the role of AP-3 in trans-Golgi DCV budding. Proteomics revealed the loss of specific known and putative novel DCV proteins, which were mislocalized and rerouted to lysosomes in AP-3-depleted cells. Bioinformatics, Proximity ligation assays and Co-immunoprecipitation identified interactions of mislocalized proteins with AP-3 subunit. These findings corroborated with functional defects in granule maturation, release modes, Zinc and neurotransmitter mobilisation. Our study highlights the complexity of the AP-3 complex in regulating DCV function and its importance in vesicle transport in neurons and neuroendocrine cells.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}
{"title": "The macroecological dynamics of sojourn trajectories in the human gut microbiome", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.27.661930", "authors": "Shoemaker, W. R.; Grilli, J.", "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is a dynamic ecosystem. Host behaviors (e.g., diet) provide a regular source of environmental variation that induce fluctuations in the abundances of resident microbiota. Despite these displacements, microbial community members are highly resilient in that they tend to fluctuate around characteristic steady-state abundances in healthy human hosts rather than suffering extinction or dominating the community. These temporary excursions from steady-state abundances, known as sojourn trajectories, have the potential to inform our understanding of the fundamental dynamics of the microbiome, as well as how often-reported measures (e.g., mean and variance of abundance) relate to temporal dynamics and, ultimately, the timescale of growth. However, to our knowledge, the macroecology of sojourn trajectories has yet to be systematically examined in any ecological system. In this study we leverage theoretical tools from the study of random walks to characterize the duration of sojourn trajectories, their shape, and the degree that diverse community members exhibit similar qualitative and quantitative dynamics. After ruling out the contribution of stationarity, we leveraged the Stochastic Logistic Model as a theoretical lens for interpreting our empirical observations. We find that the typical timescale of a sojourn trajectory does not depend on the mean abundance of a community member (i.e., its carrying capacity), though it is strongly related to its coefficient of variation. This work provides fundamental insight into the dynamics, timescales, and fluctuations exhibited by diverse microbial communities.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

G.; Feurer, D.; Vincent, G.", "abstract": "Light drones provide a cheap and effective tool to monitor forest canopy, especially in tropical and equatorial contexts, where infrastructure and resources are limiting. In these regions, good quality optical satellite images are rare, yet the stakes are maximal to characterize forest function, dynamics, diversity, and phenology, and more generally the vegetation-climate interplay. We describe a complete processing chain based on photogrammetric tools that seeks to optimize the spatial and spectral coherence between repeat image mosaics at centimetric resolution. Our target is to allow individual tree-level monitoring over tens to hundreds of hectare scales with consumer grade equipment (i.e., quadcopter with stabilized RGB camera, standard GNSS positioning). We demonstrate the increase in spatial precision achieved using Time-SIFT and Arosics algorithms, which allow (individually and synergistically) to reduce global and local spatial misalignment between mosaics from several meters to a few centimeters. Time-SIFT provides the advantage of increased robustness in initial image alignment and 3D reconstruction, and hence reduces occasional distortions or data gaps. Using Agisoft's color and white balance corrections combined with the use of vegetation indices provides meaningful quantitative signal despite considerable changes in acquisition conditions. In particular, indices that are less sensitive to illumination changes, like the green chromatic coordinate (GCC), allowed evidencing a seasonal signal over four years of monitoring in the evergreen moist forest at Paracou in French Guiana. The signal was decorrelated from obvious geometrical effect (sun height), and provided information on the vegetative stage at tree, species, and stand levels.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

F.; Fuchs, G.; Royzen, M.", "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system has become a widely used tool for genome engineering. Here we present a new method for small-molecule control of CRISPR-Cas9 using bio-orthogonal chemistry between tetrazine (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO). We carried out molecular modeling studies and identified a unique position on single guide RNA (sgRNA) that can be site-specifically tagged with Tz without disrupting its activity. We also synthesized a series of TCO-modified CRISPR suppressors. When exogenously added, they click to the Tz-tagged sgRNA, perturb the system and drastically reduce the nuclease activity. The most successful suppressor is a TCO-modified six amino acid long cell-penetrating peptide, which shows excellent cell permeability. We showed that our method to control CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease activity is general by applying it to three different sgRNAs. We also showed that our method works in solution, as well as live HEL293 cells. We utilized flow cytometry to demonstrate temporal control of CRISPR-Cas9 targeting GFP. Lastly, we showed the therapeutic potential of our method by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA).", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

In this work, we propose a novel class of bio-inspired classifier guided Deep Oscillatory Neural Network (cDONN), designed to simultaneously model and capture both neural signal dynamics and behavioural patterns. The cDONN integrates a feedforward neural network with Hopf oscillator neurons, specialized in handling sequential data generation tasks. The model features a Y-shaped structure with two output branches: one for classifying the input image that signifies behaviour, and the other for generating corresponding EEG signals that represent neural dynamics. We evaluate the performance of the behaviour classification branch using the standard ramp classification accuracy used for the cDONN network. For the EEG signal generation branch, we benchmark the generated signals using classification accuracy via a pre-trained DONN signal classifier, alongside comparison with real EEG signals using metrics such as Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), power spectrum analysis and topoplot analysis. Our analysis reveals a strong correspondence between the generated and real EEG data, particularly in the midline parietal region within the alpha frequency band, and in the left hemisphere within the delta band, indicating high fidelity and neurophysiological realism in the synthesized signals. Our approach offers a novel perspective on modelling the simultaneous relationship between neural activity and behaviour, pushing the boundaries of EEG signal generation and behavioural analysis.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}

Reconstructing accurate all-atom structures from CG representations, particularly across varied CG schemes and biomolecular types, remains a fundamental challenge. Moreover, flexible or disordered regions may well suffer from failure in structure modeling, making inpainting missing regions another challenging task. Here, we present StruCloze, a deep learning framework for reconstructing atomistic structures from CG models and inpainting missing regions for both proteins and nucleic acids. StruCloze generalizes across various CG levels and biomolecule types on single pretraining, with minimal fine-tuning required for optimal performance on specific representations. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reconstructing both protein and nucleic acid structures, demonstrates superior transferability and speed compared to existing methods. Leveraging masked learning strategy, StruCloze also excels at inpainting structurally missing regions in structures, offering a practical tool for structural refinement and integrative modeling. Our framework provides a general solution for bridging reduced or incomplete representations with full atomistic detail of biomolecular structures, enabling rapid local structure prediction and further analysis on system dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-01", "journal": ""}
