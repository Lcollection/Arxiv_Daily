Disrupted communication within this circuit is a key feature of disorders such as schizophrenia and dementia. Nucleus reuniens (NRe) is a midline thalamic nucleus that sits at the nexus of this circuit, linking these regions together. As there are no direct projections from prefrontal cortex to hippocampus, the accepted model is that the NRe mediates prefrontal drive of hippocampal activity, although these connections are poorly defined at the cellular and synaptic level. Using ex vivo optogenetics and electrophysiology, alongside monosynaptic circuit-tracing, we sought to test the mechanisms through which NRe could drive hippocampal activity. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence that pyramidal cells in CA1 receive input from NRe, with midline thalamic input to hippocampus proper appearing selective for GABAergic interneurons. In other regions targeted by NRe, we found that pyramidal cells in prosubiculum and subiculum received synaptic inputs from NRe that were at least an order of magnitude weaker than those in prefrontal or entorhinal cortices. We conclude that, contrary to widely-held assumptions in the field, the hippocampal pyramidal cells are not a major target of nucleus reuniens.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Still, the impact of such evolutionary processes on coexistence remains elusive. Here, we studied two spider mite species evolving separately on tomato plants that hyper-accumulated cadmium, a stressful environment for herbivores, or on plants without cadmium. Through experimental evolution and structural stability theory, we found that adaptation of both species to cadmium shifted predictions from exclusion to coexistence, but only in the cadmium environment. This shift occured due to a simultaneous increase in intra and a decrease in interspecific competitionin that environment. These predictions were further confirmed with complementary experiments of population dynamics, underscoring that evolution of single species in a new environment, even in absence of interspecific competitors, shapes species coexistence. Hence, population shifts to novel environments may have unforeseen evolutionary consequences for community composition and the maintenance of species diversity.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Our results showed that memory consolidation in children was less robust and strong (i.e., more forgetting) compared to young adults. Contrasting correctly retained remote versus recent memories across time delay, children showed less upregulation in posterior parahippocampal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, and cerebellum than adults. In addition, both children and adults showed decrease in scene-specific neural reinstatement over time, indicating time-related decay of detailed differentiated memories. At the same time, we observed the emergence of generic gist-like neural representations in prefrontal brain regions uniquely in children, indicating qualitative difference in memory trace in children. Taken together, 5-to-7- year-old children, compared to young adults, show less robust memory consolidation, possibly due to difficulties in engaging in differentiated neural representations in neocortical mnemonic regions during retrieval of remote memories, coupled with relying more on gist-like generic neural representations.\n\nRESEARCH HIGHLIGHTSChildren showed less robust memory consolidation across short and long delay compared to young adults.\n\nFrom short to long delay, children show differential neural upregulation for remote versus recent memory compared to young adults.\n\nOver time, both children and young adults showed reduced scene-specific reinstatement of neural patterns.\n\nChildren relied more on gist-like neural representations in medial and ventrolateral prefrontal brain regions.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

However, the earliest events of chromosome folding and their functional roles remain unclear. Using Hi-C on zebrafish embryos, we discovered that chromosome folding begins early in development with the formation of \"fountains\", a novel element of chromosome organization. Emerging preferentially at enhancers, fountains exhibit an initial accumulation of cohesin, which later redistributes to CTCF sites at TAD borders. Knockouts of pioneer transcription factors driving ZGA enhancers result in the specific loss of fountains, establishing a causal link between enhancer activation and fountain formation. Polymer simulations demonstrate that fountains may arise as sites of facilitated cohesin loading, requiring two-sided but desynchronized loop extrusion, potentially caused by cohesin collisions with obstacles or internal switching. Moreover, we detected similar fountain patterns at enhancers in mouse cells. Fountains disappear upon acute cohesin depletion, as well as during mitosis, and reappear with cohesin loading in early G1. Altogether, fountains represent the first known enhancer-specific elements of chromosome organization and constitute starting points for chromosome folding during development, likely through facilitated cohesin loading.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Most human pre-implantation embryos are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells, yet those with a low proportion of aneuploid cells can develop to term at rates similar to fully euploid embryos. How embryos manage aneuploidy during early development remains poorly understood -- yet this knowledge is crucial for improving fertility outcomes and reducing developmental defects. To investigate these mechanisms, we established a new mouse model of chromosome mosaicism to trace the fate of aneuploid cells during pre-implantation development. We previously used the Mps1 inhibitor reversine to induce aneuploidy. Here, we demonstrate that the more specific Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 similarly disrupts chromosome segregation but supports higher developmental potential than reversine. AZ3146-treated embryos transiently upregulate Hypoxia Inducible-Factor-1A (HIF1A) without triggering p53 activation. Given that pre-implantation embryos develop in a hypoxic environment in vivo, we further explored the role of oxygen tension. Hypoxia exposure in vitro reduced DNA damage in response to Mps1 inhibition and increased the proportion of euploid cells in mosaic epiblast. Conversely, HIF1A inhibition decreased the proportion of aneuploid cells. Together, these findings uncover a role for hypoxia signaling in modulating the response to chromosomal errors and suggest new strategies to improve the developmental potential of mosaic human embryos.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Given that self-reported reward sensitivity and level of substance use have been associated with differences in VS activation, we set out to investigate whether these factors would be independently associated with enhancements to neural reward responses within social contexts. In this pre-registered study, participants (N=45) underwent fMRI while playing a card guessing game in which correct or incorrect guesses resulted in monetary gains and losses that were shared evenly with either a close friend, stranger (confederate), or non-human partner. Consistent with our prior work, we found increased VS activation when sharing rewards with a socially close peer as opposed to an out-of-network stranger. As self-reported reward sensitivity increased, the difference in VS response to rewards shared with friends and strangers decreased. We also found enhanced connectivity between the VS and temporoparietal junction when sharing rewards with close friends as opposed to strangers. Finally, exploratory analyses revealed that as reward sensitivity and sub-clinical substance use increase, the difference in VS connectivity with the right fusiform face area increases as a function of social context. These findings demonstrate that responsivity to the context of close friends may be tied to individual reward sensitivity or sub-clinical substance use habits; together these factors may inform predictions of risk for future mental health disorders.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "This paper introduces a mathematical model for the growth of transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) inclusion bodies in neuron soma. The parameter representing the accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers is also introduced. The model's equations enable the numerical calculation of the concentrations of TDP-43 monomers, dimers, free oligomers, and oligomers deposited in inclusion bodies. By simulating the deposition of free oligomers into inclusion bodies, the model predicts the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies. An approximate solution to the model equations is derived for the scenario where protein degradation machinery is dysfunctional, leading to infinite half-lives for TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and both free and deposited oligomers. This solution, valid at large times, predicts that the radius of the inclusion body increases proportionally to the cube root of time, whereas the accumulated neurotoxicity increases linearly with time. To the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first to model the relationship between the size of TDP-43 inclusion bodies and time, and the first to introduce the concept of accumulated neurotoxicity caused by misfolded TDP-43 oligomers. Sensitivity analysis of the approximate solution indicates that the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity become independent of the kinetic constants at large timescales. While the numerical solution of the full mathematical model continues to work with finite half-lives, the approximate solution becomes invalid for scenarios with physiologically relevant (finite) half-lives of TDP-43 dimers, monomers, and free misfolded oligomers. In contrast to the scenario with infinite half-lives, the numerical solution reveals that, for different values of the kinetic constants, the curves representing the inclusion body radius and accumulated neurotoxicity converge to distinct curves over time.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Participants localized (left vs. right) each sound in eight-item sequences, with trigeminally-potent odorants presented concurrently with the first four sounds (left, right, or both nostrils). Unbeknownst to participants, some sounds originated from the center. For central sounds, the proportion of right-ward responses increased with right-nostril stimulation but decreased with left-nostril stimulation (relative to controls). This bias was strongest in the second half of the sequence and disappeared at larger sound eccentricity. Diffusion modeling showed the bias was best explained by changes in drift rate (perceptual evidence accumulation), not in starting point (decision bias). EEG alpha-band activity lateralized towards the chosen side for central sounds, consistent with attentional orienting towards the perceived location, and was diminished at large eccentricities with incongruent chemosensory stimulation.

To test this, participants controlled a cursor that was subject to a visual rotation in its motion direction. The rotation was applied during two learning periods, separated by a washout period where the rotation was removed abruptly, gradually, or without error feedback. We found that the type of error experienced during washout affected savings: abrupt washout with large errors eliminated savings, whereas gradual or no-feedback washout preserved it. Model-based analyses indicated these effects were driven by changes in error sensitivity suggesting that salient, opposing errors experienced during washout downregulate the response to error, nullifying savings.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

SlimVar uses rapid photobleaching to resolve tracked particles to molecular steps in intensity. By modifying widefield microscopy to minimise optical aberrations and robustly post-process few-photon signals, SlimVar mitigates performance losses at depth. We use SlimVar to quantify chromatin-protein assemblies in nuclei, finding that two homologous proteins key to epigenetic switching at FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) - cold-induced VERNALISATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3) and constitutively expressed VERNALISATION 5 (VRN5) - exhibit dynamic assemblies during FLC silencing. Upon cold exposure, the number of assembly molecules increases up to 100% to a median of ~20 molecules. Larger VRN5 assemblies preferentially colocalise with an FLC lacO transgenic reporter during prolonged cold and persist after return to warmth.

{"title": "Measurements of Contractility in Actin Convergence Zone and KIF11-Inhibited Mitotic Spindles", "doi": "10.1101/2024.06.28.601275", "authors": "Matov, A.", "abstract": "Introduction: The complex dynamics of cytoskeletal meshworks make them a difficult subject of study. With the advent of fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) and other technological advances in microscopy techniques, much more is now known about how the filamentous actin (F-actin) and microtubule (MT) networks work within cells to give rise to the vast array of functions which require them. A current challenge to the imaging field is to improve the utility and accuracy of the computational approaches required to analyze large and complex imaging datasets. Here, we present the results of a computational method that, when applied to FSM time-lapse series, can capture the instantaneous state of the rapidly changing, dense, and multi-directional speckle flows often exhibited by cytoskeletal dynamics in living systems. Re-analysis of previously published FSM image sets demonstrates that this method, which we call the Instantaneous Flow Tracking Algorithm (IFTA), can accurately detect speckle flows in mitotic spindles and F-actin meshworks, even in regions of high dynamicity of overlapping, anti-parallel flows where previous methods failed. Methods: The anti-parallel flow at the metaphase plate of the mitotic spindle is a well-known phenomenon during the initial stages of chromosome segregation and it has been measured by several approaches, mostly in stationary spindles which do not exhibit any polar rotation. The mitotic spindle is the target of many cancer and neurodegenerative drugs and as such, there has been many attempts at inhibiting its basic functions with the objective of preventing chromosome segregation and the formation of new daughter cells. Such attempts have largely been focused on the inhibition of the action of MT plus-end directed motors, for instance the kinesin KIF11. Spindles with inhibited kinesins have been thought to exhibit no MT flux, however IFTA measured regional flux of up to 2.7 um/min, which reveals the activity of potent secondary flux mechanisms. These results suggest novel, additional, approaches toward arresting cells in mitosis during patient treatment. Results: The traditional tracking methods erroneously measure zero flux in areas where contractile F-actin flows meet, denoted as a 'convergence zone' and commonly found in the lamella of motile cells and the neck of growth cones. When IFTA was used to analyze FSM datasets derived from these structures, we detected high rates of protein turnover, anti-parallel speckle motion, and fast flux of actin subunits in both directions in the same 'convergence zones'. This demonstrates the presence of a molecular machinery based on contractility in the lamella/lamellipodium of migrating cells and at the base of growing neurons, which can be exploited in the clinic. When applied to FSM data of migrating kangaroo rat kidney epithelial PtK1 cells overexpressing different isoforms of the actin-based motor tropomyosin, IFTA revealed distinct, isoform-specific effects on contractile F-actin flows. Specifically, we found that decreased affinity between tropomyosin and F-actin correlated with an increase in speckle velocity heterogeneity. Conclusions: Such quantitative imaging analysis offers the ability to reliably test novel therapeutics ex vivo. Significance statement: The main discoveries presented in the manuscript are related to the ability of the cell to adapt to a range of biochemical and mechanical perturbations. As cell therapy is becoming the forefront of precision medicine, it would be critical to anticipate the mechanisms of action of engineered immune cells. The pathways activated during therapy can be pinpointed by measuring its effects on the target proteins in patient-derived living cells. The clinical application of the approach outlined in this manuscript pertains to analyzing drug resistance in cancer therapy and the treatment of neurodegeneration. Our hypothesis is that targeting actin in resistant tumors could sensitize cancer cells to tubulin inhibitors. If this proves true, it will have implications in the clinic.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

To address this, we chronically implanted many Neuropixels probes in rats to simultaneously record from thousands of neurons across up to twenty brain regions during performance of an auditory decision making task. This allowed decoding, on the same set of trials and for each of the simultaneously recorded regions, the time-varying state of the decision as it is being formed. During decision formation, we found strong moment-by-moment co-fluctuations in decision states across regions, even across trials with identical stimuli and choices, with the co-fluctuations lying largely along a single dimension, indicating a shared computation. However, the shared decision signals were strongest, and were detected earliest on single trials, in a subset of interconnected frontal cortical regions and anterior striatum, indicating that they are computed in a small subnetwork and then propagated more broadly. We also decoded from each region the estimated time of decision commitment, which corresponds to when the subject internally \"makes up their mind\" and stops considering new evidence. We again found strong co-fluctuations in the timing of this estimate across regions that lay along a single dominant dimension. Commitment signals were strongest and detected earliest in primary motor cortex. Finally, the moment of decision commitment marked a critical transition in coordinated decision-related activity across the brain. These results show that decision formation and commitment reflect internally-generated signals that are largely unified across the brain, demonstrating the power of large-scale simultaneous recordings to characterize the internal cognitive computations that structure brain-wide neural activity.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

One potential explanation for this organotropic behavior is that cancer cells gain properties that enable thriving in certain microenvironments. Such specific metastatic traits may arise from gene regulation at the primary tumor site. Spatial genome organization plays a crucial role in oncogenic transformation and progression, but the extent to which chromosome architecture contributes to organ-specific metastatic traits is unclear. This work characterizes chromosome architecture changes associated with organotropic metastatic traits. By comparing a collection of genomic data from different subtypes of localized and lung metastatic breast cancer cells with both normal and cancerous lung cells, we find important trends of genomic reorganization. The most striking differences in 3D genome compartments segregate cell types according to their epithelial vs. mesenchymal status. This EMT compartment signature occurs at genomic regions distinct from transcription-defined EMT signatures, suggesting a separate layer of regulation. Specifically querying organotropism, we find 3D genome changes consistent with adaptations needed to survive in a new microenvironment, with lung metastatic breast cells exhibiting compartment switch signatures that shift the genome architecture to a lung cell-like conformation and brain metastatic prostate cancer cells showing compartment shifts toward a brain-like state. TCGA patient data reveals gene expression changes concordant with these organ-permissive compartment changes. These results suggest that genome architecture provides an additional level of cell fate specification informing organotropism and enabling survival at the metastatic site.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Mice learned to generate such Conditioned Waves, which became progressively more stereotyped and were preceded by a characteristic suppression of cortical activity.

Current theories propose that the long-term maintenance of synaptic efficacies and memory is accomplished via a positive-feedback loop at the level of production of a protein species or a protein state. Here we propose a qualitatively different theoretical framework based on negative feedback at the level of protein elimination. This theory is motivated by recent experimental findings regarding the binding of PKM{zeta} and KI-BRA, two synaptic proteins involved in maintenance of memory, and on how this binding downregulates the proteins degradation. We demonstrate this theoretical framework with two different models. First, a simple abstract model to explore generic features of the negative-feedback process. Second, a biophysical model based on PKM{zeta}-KIBRA dimers that cooperatively form larger complexes at active synapses. These larger complexes have slower degradation and diffusion, allowing for bistability of potentiated and unpotentiated synaptic states. The results of these models are qualitatively consistent with existing experiments showing reversal of long-term potentiation and erasure of long-term memory by inhibition of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} interactions.

For the few isolates with discordant calls, we show that Typhi Mykrobe results are better supported by the evidence from raw sequence read data than the results generated using the mapping-based approach. We also demonstrate 99.9% concordance for detection of AMR determinants compared with the current standard assembly-based approach, with similar results for plasmid marker detection. Typhi Mykrobe predicts clinical resistance categorisation (S/I/R) for eight drug classes, and we show strong agreement with phenotypic categorisations generated from reference laboratory minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data for n=1,572 Illumina-sequenced isolates (>99% agreement within one doubling dilution). We show strong concordance (>96% for genotype and >98% for AMR and plasmid) between calls made from ONT reads and those made from Illumina reads for isolates sequenced on both platforms (n =93 genomes). Typhi Mykrobe takes less than a minute per sample and is available at https://github.com/typhoidgenomics/genotyphi. Conclusions: Typhi Mykrobe provides rapid and sensitive genotyping of Typhi genomes direct from Illumina and ONT reads, although lower accuracy was observed for R9 ONT data. It demonstrated accurate assignment of GenoTyphi lineage, detection of AMR determinants and prediction of corresponding AMR phenotypes, and identification of plasmid replicons.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Under fluid flow, biofilms can form as streamers -- slender filaments tethered to solid surfaces and suspended in the flowing fluid. Streamers thrive in environments subjected to intense hydrodynamic stresses, such as medical devices and water filters, often resulting in catastrophic clogging. Their colonisation success may depend on a highly adaptable mechanical response to varying stress conditions, though the evidence and underlying mechanisms of this adaptation remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that biofilm streamers exhibit a stress-hardening behaviour, with both differential elastic modulus and effective viscosity increasing linearly with external stress. This stress-hardening is consistent across biofilms with different matrix compositions, formed by various bacterial species, and under diverse growth conditions. We further demonstrate that this mechanical response originates from the properties of extracellular DNA (eDNA) molecules, which constitute the structural backbone of the streamers. In addition, our results identify extracellular RNA (eRNA) as a modulator of the matrix network, contributing to both the structure and rheological properties of the eDNA backbone. Our findings reveal an instantaneous, purely physical mechanism enabling streamers to adapt to hydrodynamic stresses. Given the ubiquity of extracellular nucleic acids (eNA) in biofilms, this discovery prompts a re-evaluation of their functional role in biofilm mechanics, with potential implications for biofilm structural integrity, ecological resilience, and colonisation dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Applying CoPISA to two rationally designed AML drug pairs, LY3009120-sapanisertib (LS) and ruxolitinib-ulixertinib (RU), we mapped primary (lysate) and secondary (living cell) protein target landscapes. Notably, our analysis uncovered an emergent mechanistic principle, \"conjunctional targeting\" (i.e., conjunctional inhibition), wherein cooperative drug actions induce treatment-specific targets not achievable individually, analogous to an AND-gate logic model. LS-specific AND-gate proteins converged on SUMOylation, chromatin condensation, and VEGF-linked adhesion, while RU-specific targets disrupted DNA-damage checkpoints, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and RNA-splicing machinery, collectively implicating synthetic-lethal vulnerabilities. Additionally, the post-translational modifications (PTMs) profiling of differential soluble proteins confirms several combination-induced modifications (e.g., acetylation, dimethylation, phosphorylation) on key AML proteins, such as NPM1. Network interrogation of AML-associated proteins showed that a high percentage of targeted proteins are unique to the combinations, including frequently mutated drivers DNMT3A, NPM1, and TP53.

Furthermore, eye movements are emerging as significant indicators of psychopathologies and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, dementia, depression, and tinnitus. Despite its crucial importance across domains, the role of oculomotion has been underexplored in neuroimaging studies - largely due to methodological challenges. These challenges often involve treating eye movements as artefacts to be removed from the neural signal. While useful for data cleaning, this approach risks discarding valuable information about oculomotor control. An alternative is to directly model these signals. Using recently established time-resolved regression methods, we apply and extend this approach to present a unified framework we term \"Ocular Response Functions\"(ORFs). Using simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking during the resting-state, we derive ORFs that characterise the neural signatures of distinct oculomotor events, specifically saccades, blinks, and pupil dilation. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to model the relationship between ocular action and neural activity (encoding) and, conversely, to reconstruct ocular events from brain activity. We further validate this approach by applying resting-state derived ORFs to a passive listening task, showing they can reveal oculomotor contributions to task-related neural processing.

These circuits traverse a cortical nucleus (LMAN), a specialized region of the basal ganglia essential for vocal learning (Area X), and a region of dorsomedial thalamus (DLM). Area X includes analogs of mammalian direct and indirect pathways that may have opposing effects and thereby increase or inhibit thalamic activity respectively. Direct pallidal neurons of Area X send projections to DLM, whereas indirect pallidal neurons form intrinsic connections onto DLM-projecting neurons. Expression of the transcription factor FoxP2 in the basal ganglia is necessary for normal vocal learning and production in both humans and songbirds. We used tract-tracing techniques to label direct pallidal Area X[-&gt;]DLM projection neurons and immunohistochemical techniques to label neurons expressing the transcription factor FoxP2 in adult and juvenile male zebra finches. Our results showed that DLM-projecting neurons in Area X did not express FoxP2 in either adults or juveniles. We also observed a population of large neurons that expressed FoxP2 but were not retrogradely-labeled from DLM. A putative marker of striatal neurons (DARPP-32) did not co-localize with FoxP2 in most of these large neurons, suggesting that they form a class of indirect pallidal neurons.

Yet laboratory tests of decision making often investigate how animals optimize their behavior to achieve a single, well-defined goal, which is often a nutritive reward. Thus, how animals solve multi-objective optimization problems is not well understood. Here, we devised an ethologically-inspired decision making task to examine how rats balance the pursuit of food and non-food reinforcement. Rats performed a free-choice patch-foraging task, in which they could earn food in one location (food patch) or interact with a rodent play structure in a different location (toy patch). The cost of switching between patches was manipulated by requiring rats to endure a long or short \"travel time\" penalty during which they were not able to access either patch. Rats devoted a considerable amount of their limited foraging time to patches of both types, showing a small but significant preference for food patches. In accordance with theoretical models of foraging, when the cost of switching patches was high rats chose longer stay durations in both types of patches, suggesting that similar rational principles guided their pursuit of food and non-food rewards. Examining the within-session dynamics of time allocation revealed that rats showed an early preference for spending time in toy patches that reversed over the course of the session. Satiety manipulations demonstrated that patch residence time decisions were under goal-directed control, and responsive to current needs and recent consumption. These results validate a naturalistic approach to testing decision making in rats over a range of food and non-food goods.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluate the role of the brainstem on speech-in-noise perception and selective attention using a continuous, speech-based stimulus with embedded chirps (Cheech) that rapidly and effectively evokes auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) while participants listen to short story narratives. The Cheech-modified stories were presented alone or in the presence of another spatially separated talker, and neural responses were measured throughout by EEG. Both word-level detection performance and narrative-level comprehension were evaluated, as well as subjective reports of listening effort. ABR wave V was modulated by the presence of a competing talker, selective attention for the target versus masker, and the talker sex. Additionally, faster wave V peak latencies and larger amplitudes were associated with identification of the target words embedded within the stories, while faster latencies additionally related to better comprehension question accuracy and lower subjective listening effort.

J.; McClean, S.", "abstract": "Opportunistic bacterial infections are an increasing threat, especially for immunocompromised individuals such as people with cystic fibrosis (CF), driving morbidity and mortality. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen associated with chronic lung infections, that has been extensively studied in this context, but the mechanism(s) driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the lung are not fully understood. This work focuses on the adaptations of P. aeruginosa to long-term hypoxia, one of the important environmental pressures present in the CF lung, to investigate whether it drives the development of persistence in CF patients. We used an experimental evolution approach to investigate how an early CF strain adapted to 6% oxygen over 28 days. We focussed on the impact of long-term hypoxia on the proteome and investigated the emergence of stable changes in phenotype. Changes in the abundance of >140 proteins were observed compared to the ancestral strain, including proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, stress response, iron homeostasis, biofilm formation and those previously associated with chronic infection. Significant changes in the abundance of proteins regulating cellular c-di-GMP levels were also observed. We show that two distinct P. aeruginosa small colony variants (SCVs) emerged, one exclusively in hypoxia exposed cultures. Hypoxia-adapted cultures developed resistance to 8 out of 13 antibiotics tested; increased biofilm and exopolysaccharide production; and decreased pyocyanin production, consistent with the changes in the proteome. All hypoxia-adapted cultures showed decreased siderophore production. Overall, we demonstrate that long-term hypoxia exposure contributes to multiple changes in phenotype and proteome that are frequently observed in P. aeruginosa CF lung chronic infection isolates. This suggests that hypoxia is driving these adaptations, at least in part, and opens a new path to treatment.\n\nAuthor SummaryOpportunistic antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are an increasing threat, particularly for immunocompromised individuals such as people with cystic fibrosis (CF). These infections increase disease severity, the number of deaths and healthcare costs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen in this context, causing persistent infections, yet the mechanisms driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung are not understood.\n\nWe investigated the adaptations that P. aeruginosa exposed to low oxygen conditions (an important environmental pressure in the CF lung) for 28 days, to examine whether it drives adaptations that lead to chronic infection. We found that prolonged exposure to hypoxia induced stable changes in P. aeruginosa, which are distinct from those reported after short term exposure. We observed multiple adaptations in hypoxia adapted cultures, many of which were associated with important signalling networks linked to lifestyle shifts in bacteria and several were also observed in isolates that had adapted to chronic infection. Similar adaptive responses in other opportunistic environmental pathogens suggest that this process of adaptation could be targeted to create universal therapeutic approaches preventing antibiotic overuse and improving patient outcomes.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

How such balance is impaired in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), remains unresolved. Here, we define colon-specific macrophage states and reveal the critical role of non-inflammatory colon-associated macrophages (niColAMs) in IBD recovery. Through trans-scale analyses, integrating computational transcriptomics, proteomics, and in vivo interventional studies, we identified GIV (CCDC88A) as a key regulator of niColAMs. GIV emerged as the top-ranked gene in niColAMs that physically and functionally interacts with NOD2, an innate immune sensor implicated in CD and UC. Myeloid-specific GIV depletion exacerbates infectious colitis, prolongs disease, and abolishes the protective effects of the NOD2 ligand, muramyl dipeptide, in colitis and sepsis models. Mechanistically, GIV C-terminus binds the terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR#10) of NOD2 and is required for NOD2 to dampen inflammation and clear microbes. The CD-associated 1007fs NOD2-variant, which lacks LRR#10, cannot bind GIV, providing critical insights into how this clinically relevant variant impairs microbial sensing and clearance.

Human infections primarily arise from rodent-to-human transmission, with Mastomys natalensis, a synanthropic species, serving as the principal reservoir. In Sierra Leone, small-mammal communities vary across land use gradients, potentially shaping LASV transmission risk in human populations. However, the extent to which anthropogenic environments facilitate small-mammal interactions conducive to viral transmission remains poorly understood. We conducted small-mammal sampling over 43,266 trap nights, detecting 684 rodents and shrews in the LASV-endemic Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. To assess potential for within- and between-species transmission, we constructed space-sharing networks based on co-trapping within species-specific radii informed by home range estimates. These networks approximated shared space use rather than direct interaction, allowing comparison of potential encounter patterns across habitats. Small-mammal communities in agricultural settings supported a greater number of distinct species (higher species richness) and exhibited denser interaction networks (higher average degree) than those in villages and forests, although overall space-sharing rates did not differ substantially. Network topology varied by land use, with village networks showing greater modularity (i.e., being more fragmented into distinct interaction clusters). Notably, space sharing among M. natalensis individuals was more frequent in agricultural settings than in villages, suggesting that land use may modulate opportunities for intra-specific viral transmission. LASV seroprevalence across the small-mammal community was 5.7%, with antibodies detected in nine species. We found no significant association between seroprevalence and land use or network structure. These findings demonstrate that simple ecological drivers do not fully explain LASV exposure patterns.

We examined whether acute stress impairs memory inference and if retrieval practice can buffer this effect. Participants were trained on image pairs, AB and BC, to establish interconnected triads (ABC) with a shared bridge element B. Twenty-four hours later, we induced acute stress in half of the participants and then tested their capacity to infer the indirect AC associations. Behavioral results indicated that acute stress reduced memory inference accuracy and speed, yet targeted retrieval practice of the AB and BC pairs after encoding prevented the stress-induced impairment in both A-C inference accuracy and speed. Using multivariate decoding analysis of human electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we found neural evidence that bridge element B is rapidly reactivated during the inferential process, a neural signature predictive of subsequent successful inference. Importantly, stress disrupts this rapid neural reactivation of the bridge element, but retrieval practice buffers the stress effect and enhances the strength of reactivation signals beyond the non-stress condition. Time-frequency analyses of theta oscillations mirrored these effects of stress and retrieval practice on inference performance and neural reactivation. Collectively, our findings pinpoint rapid reactivation of the bridge element as an essential neural mechanism for memory-based inference. Although susceptible to stress, this mechanism can be enhanced through retrieval practice, suggesting that building robust memory traces renders subsequent inferences resilient to stress.\n\nSignificance StatementStress often disrupts our ability to form new connections from past experiences, thereby limiting cognitive flexibility. Our study demonstrates that stress impairs memory inference-the ability to link related events to generate novel links-by disrupting the rapid reactivation of critical memory elements.

By reactivating prior memory traces through repeated recall, we can restore the ability to make inferences and even enhance the strength of memory reactivation.

We found that animals engaged with the task in most trials, and, within engaged trials, transitioned from exploratory to efficient behavior. Learning was marked by performance gains and the emergence of reproducible movement patterns between specific dispensers. Through trajectory analyses and probabilistic modeling, we showed that these patterns reflected the consolidation of local transition motifs characterized by increased regularity and reduced spatial entropy. These patterns were flexibly recombined into variable global sequences. Thus, animals exhibited a hybrid strategy based on route segments flexibly embedded within a topological structure.

However, due to rapid urban expansion and severe deforestation, this area is recognized as one of the top global conservation priorities. As in other tropical regions, the prevailing idea is that the decline of local biodiversity in this region is a direct result of the overwhelming environmental changes that have occurred over the last 80 years. However, paleoecological data indicate that tropical forests have been exploited by human populations since at least the Late Pleistocene, and forest clearance for farming began several thousand years ago. To gain a complete overview of the long-term evolution of vertebrate fauna in continental Southeast Asia, it is necessary to investigate the past. This task is currently out of reach, mainly due to the lack of paleontological and historical studies regarding small animals, including emblematic taxa like turtles. Indeed, although some evidence suggests that the biodiversity of turtles in continental Southeast Asia may have changed over the last millennia, the paucity of historical records and archaeological assemblages studies currently precludes further assessment of the potential effect of past environmental changes, including potential human disturbances. The present study consists of a paleontological analysis of turtle bone assemblages collected from four prehistoric sites in Thailand and Cambodia. The aim is to test the hypothesis of changes in turtle biodiversity over the last 10,000 years. Our results indicate that turtle assemblages in most areas have experienced only limited changes across the Holocene, except for Laang Spean in Cambodia. However, a few 45 rare taxa may represent extirpated or extinct species of Testudinidae in continental Southeast Asia at an unknown time during the Holocene. We also observed significant changes in the geographic distribution of some genera, such as Batagur, Cyclemys, and Amyda. The fact that turtle fauna has been rather resilient and unchanged for several millennia shows that past human impact in most investigated areas had limited effects on these taxa. The strong modifications observed in Cambodia could, however, serve as a warning about the potential fate of turtle biodiversity in this region if further loss of natural environments occurs.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Genetic linkage between a major-effect variant in the phytoene synthase 2 (PSY2) gene and nearby candidate gene(s) has been thought to drive this correlation. Evidence from molecular experiments, however, suggest there may be a metabolic relationship between TC and DM, which we predicted would create genome-wide mediated pleiotropy. Bivariate genome-wide associations were used to test the hypothesis of pleiotropy and examine the genetic architecture of the negative covariance between TC and DM. A population of 378 accessions in the yellow-fleshed cassava breeding program at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Ibadan, Nigeria was genotyped with DArTseqLD. TC measured by iCheckTM spectrometer and DM data were available from field trials over ten years across three locations in Nigeria. Mixed linear models controlling for the previously-identified PSY2 causal variant were used to identify multiple new quantitative trait loci (QTL) jointly associated with both traits. A binomial test with 13 jointly-associated loci identified at a relaxed significance threshold indicated that loci are significantly more likely to affect TC and DM in opposite directions. Even after accounting for the effects of these 13 loci, there was significantly negative polygenic covariance between TC and DM remaining. These findings support the hypothesis that mediated pleiotropy rather than genetic linkage drives the negative genetic correlation between TC and DM in cassava and demonstrate a new application of multivariate GWAS for interrogating the genetic architecture of correlated traits.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Pathogenic variants in RECQL4 are clinically associated with three rare autosomal recessive conditions: Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome type II, Baller-Gerold Syndrome and RAPADILINO syndrome. These three syndromes show overlapping growth retardation, low bone density and skeletal defects affecting the arms and hands. Here, we take advantage of the ability to generate one-sided CRISPR knockdowns of recql4 in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Tadpoles develop normally until feeding starts, after which growth slows on the edited side leading to a curved posture, smaller eyes (micropthalmia) and reduced head size (microcephaly). Forelimb buds fail to develop, leading to complete absense of the forelimb on the edited side. Additionally, Meckels cartilage (lower jaw) ossification is absent or reduced and the hyoid cartilage is smaller, but this is not due to deficiencies in cranial neural crest migration on the edited side. Knockdown of recql4 also results in hypoplastic vasculature, with reduced branching from the aorta on the edited side. Taken together, our results clearly show the utility of unilateral CRISPR editing in Xenopus for understanding the specific phenotypic developmental effects of mutations affecting cell proliferation.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

However, a challenge in ancient genomic analysis is the relatively low genome coverage for most samples, limiting analysis to pseudohaploid genotypes. Genotype imputation offers potential to alleviate this limitation by improving information content and accuracy in low coverage genomes. To test this we used published high coverage (>8x) goat palaeogenomes, imputing downsampled genomes using the VarGoats dataset (1,372 individuals) as a reference panel. Measuring concordance between imputed and high coverage genotypes, we find high concordance after filtering for common (>5%), high confidence variants, with 0.5x genomes reaching >0.97 concordance. There is a trade-off between coverage, genotype probability (GP) thresholds, and genotype recovery, where higher coverage and more lenient GP thresholds result in higher recovery, and a reduction in heterozygous false positive rates with stricter thresholds. We then imputed 36 goat palaeogenomes with [&ge;]0.5x coverage to examine runs-of-homozygosity (ROH) and identity-by-descent (IBD) patterns. Using a novel approach combining ROH profiles across tools, we find that among Neolithic goats, ROH increases with distance from the Zagros Mountains, suggesting a large effect of the initial dispersal of managed herds. Inbreeding levels decrease across Southwest Asia in more recent periods. IBD mirrored this pattern, with less relatedness in the early herding site of Ganj Dareh compared to higher relatedness in goats from later in the dispersal process. These findings provide insights into the genetic consequences of early goat management on demography, and confirm the utility of imputation in leveraging low coverage palaeogenomes.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Because experiments to collect training data are often expensive, time-consuming, and/or otherwise limited, alternatives that make good use of small amounts of data to guide protein engineering are of high potential value. One potential alternative to large-scale benchtop experiments for collecting training data is high-throughput molecular dynamics simulation; however, to date this source of data has been largely absent from the literature. Here, I introduce a new method for selecting desirable protein variants based on quantified relationships between a small number of experimentally determined labels and descriptors of their dynamic properties. These descriptors are provided by deep neural networks trained on data from molecular dynamics simulations of variants of the protein of interest. I demonstrate that this approach can obtain very highly optimized variants based on small amounts of experimental data, outperforming alternative approaches to machine learning-guided directed evolution with the same amount of experimental data. Furthermore, I show that quantified dynamics-property relationships based on only a handful of experimentally labeled example sequences can be used to accurately predict the key residues that are most relevant to determining the property in question, even when that information could not have been known or predicted based on either the molecular dynamics simulations or the experimental data alone.

SLIT2 expression has previously been linked to dementia risk. Objective: To study the association between SLIT2 expression in human vitreous humor and plasma samples and neurocognitive test scores in a cross-sectional cohort study utilizing a novel, highly-sensitive Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay for SLIT2 detection. Methods: Seventy-nine individuals with a mean age of 55.79 {+/-} 12.03 years underwent eye surgery with collection of vitreous humor, blood (plasma) collection, and neurocognitive assessment. Vitreous humor and plasma samples were analyzed by SLIT2 MSD electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Associations between SLIT2 levels in vitreous humor and plasma were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Results: We found up to a 7-fold higher level of SLIT2 in human vitreous humor compared to plasma. Lower vitreous SLIT2 levels were associated with a lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score and Immediate Recall Verbatim (IRV) z-score, and higher plasma SLIT2 was associated with a lower MoCA score. In multivariate analysis using single and multiple predictor models, the same significant associations were found when adjusted for age, sex, race, diabetic status, diabetic retinopathy status, glaucoma status, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Conclusions: SLIT2 protein levels are significantly associated with MoCA score and IRV z-score in middle-aged individuals.

While the response of leaf functional traits to these global change factors have been widely studied, reproductive traits remain relatively understudied, despite their key role in the diversification and distribution of flowering plants. Here, we investigated how elevated CO2, warming, drought, and their interactions affect floral, leaf and seed traits in two model grassland species. We also examined how these factors influence trait coordination. Methods: Two common grassland species, Lotus corniculatus and Crepis capillaris, were sampled from a 10-year climate manipulation experiment. We measured resource economic traits related to organ size, construction cost, and dry matter content in both leaves and flowers, along with seed size and number. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess trait responses, and rank-abundance curves were employed to visualize changes in trait coordination across treatments. Key Results: Trait responses to global change factors varied between species. Drought emerged as the most influential factor, affecting only leaf traits in L. corniculatus, but impacting leaf, floral, and seed traits in C. capillaris. Across both species, global change conditions increased leaf construction costs and reduced flower size. In addition, it led to larger leaves in L. corniculatus, and fewer seeds in C. capillaris. Under extreme global change conditions, trait coordination became stronger in both species, although C. capillaris showed no coordination response specifically to drought. Conclusion: Our results show that floral economic traits, like leaf traits, are responsive to individual and combined effects of global change factors. This highlights their importance in shaping plant strategies under environmental stress and emphasizes the need to better integrate floral traits into the whole-plant economic framework.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

B.; Fortuna, R.; DuVal, D.; Paquet, M.; Doutrelant, C.", "abstract": "Infanticide, the killing of dependent young by adult conspecifics, is an extreme form of conflict that remains poorly understood. Previous studies suggest that it is associated with reproductive benefits, either by making breeders newly available for reproduction or by increasing offspring care and reducing competition for resources. In addition, infanticide may result from a reproductive trade-off, where parents kill their offspring if environmental conditions compromise their reproductive value. Here, we combine video, genetic and individual-level reproductive data collected over 12 years to describe infanticide in a highly social, cooperative bird, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius and to establish whether direct reproductive benefits or life-history trade-offs are possible motivators for this behaviour. We documented 50 cases of infanticide and identified 27 aggressors with known histories. These were mostly born outside the colonies where they committed infanticide (63%) and there was some bias towards females and younger individuals. Aggressors were usually not part of the victims breeding group (74%), but in two cases infanticide was committed by the breeding female, and in five by helpers. In most cases, aggressors were not reproducing at the time of the infanticide, were never recorded mating with any of the breeders from the attacked nest, nor occupied the nest from where the chicks were evicted. Only eight of the known aggressors were confirmed as breeders after the attacks, and these mostly reproduced at the colony where the attacks were committed. Overall, we found no evidence for direct reproductive benefits of infanticide in sociable weavers. However, the younger age of aggressors, lack of genetic relatedness to the victims and future breeding at the colony suggest that competition between breeding groups, and hence indirect reproductive benefits, could provide motivation for infanticide in this population. Additional work over longer periods is needed to identify these possible indirect fitness benefits of infanticide.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

CD20 is localized within a membrane nanocluster harboring the IgD class B cell antigen receptor (IgD-BCR) where it functions as a gatekeeper for the resting state of naive B lymphocytes. How CD20 exerts its gatekeeper function is not yet known. Using Ramos and human peripheral blood B cells, we show here that the serine/threonine kinase PKC{delta} constitutively phosphorylates serine residues at the cytosolic tails of CD20. The phosphorylated CD20 becomes a target for 14-3-3 adaptor proteins that link CD20 to the RhoA GDP/GTP exchange factor GEF-H1 and the microtubule (MT) network controlling the stability of the IgD-BCR nanocluster. The binding of anti-CD20 antibodies results in MT disassembly and the replacement of the GEF-H1/CD20 complex by a RhoA-GTP/ROCK1/CD20 complex which drives actomyosin contractility. Our study suggests that CD20 not only maintains the resting state, but also orchestrates the MT/actin switch in active B lymphocytes. This could have implications for treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies and may help to optimize therapeutic protocols.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations. NBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian versions of NBDA have been proposed before, although these implementations have seen limited usage and have not kept pace with the evolving ecosystem of Bayesian methods. There is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA. Here, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package \"STbayes\" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for covariates that may influence transmission, and varying (random) effects. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals can improve model fit. Our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules, and we describe a numerically stable parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a \"high-resolution\" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods.

Whether this specificity is due to an unknown ordered-structure-mediated interaction or from the dynamic multivalent interactions between the patterned charged amino acids in the disordered regions was unresolved. Here we show that a polymer physics-based model that only accounts for multivalent interactions among polymers in a statistical manner can largely explain published data on selective partitioning and make predictions that are subsequently experimentally validated.

Here, we report a spatially resolved, single-cell molecular catalog of the transcriptomes of 26 individual gastruloids. We found that cell type composition and spatial organization were remarkably consistent across gastruloids. Posterior cell types formed distinct, organized clusters, while anterior cell types were more disorganized. To distinguish progressive differentiation from cell type differences, we developed the L-metric, a parameter-free quantification of mutually exclusive gene expression. This analysis revealed spatial organization without explicit encoding, recapitulated known cell type relationships, and identified novel gene expression states and spatial subclusters within cell types. We confirmed that in gastruloids, NMP differentiation occurred through a continuous, spatially-coordinated process. We also showed that endothelial precursors exhibited unique spatial organization and had distinct gene expression profiles dependent on their association with anterior somitic or posterior endodermal tissues.

The small GTPase, KRAS, is mutated in over 90% of PDAC patients and considered the primary driver mutation. Despite being an almost ubiquitous event, KRAS mutations have been difficult to target therapeutically, particularly KRASG12D, the most common mutation in PDAC. In addition to these pharmacological challenges, KRAS mutations have been shown to drive signaling plasticity and therapeutic resistance through phosphorylation cascades in most cancers. Protein phosphatases are master regulators of kinase signaling, however the contribution of phosphatase deregulation to mutant KRAS cancer phenotypes is poorly understood. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibits effectors downstream of KRAS, placing this family of enzymes as key regulators of PDAC oncogenic signaling. However, our previous studies utilizing small molecule activating compounds of PP2A show a heterogeneous response in PDAC, with some cell lines displaying increased oncogenic signaling despite induction of phosphatase activity. Similarly, specific PP2A subunits exhibit both tumor suppressive and oncogenic functions depending on the cellular context. Therefore, understanding the role of PP2A in regulating cancer phenotypes is critical for the future development of therapeutic strategies that leverage this phosphatase. Here, we determined the impact of the specific PP2A subunit, B56, on PDAC phenotypes using both genetic and pharmacological activation strategies in human PDAC cell lines and genetic mouse models.We demonstrate that while PP2A-B56 suppresses specific oncogenic pathways, B56 activation exacerbates PDAC proliferative phenotypes and decreases overall survival in vivo, potentially through increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. EGFR is a critical signaling node in PDAC as inhibition or loss of EGFR prevents KRAS-driven tumorigenesis and increased EGFR activity is associated with poor patient outcome. The activation of EGFR by PP2A-B56 is in part mediated through increased expression and processing of EGFR ligands, specifically amphiregulin, HB-EGF, and epiregulin. Furthermore, pharmacological PP2A activation in combination with EGFR inhibitors mitigates this signaling and increases cell death. Together, these studies implicate a previously undescribed non-canonical role for PP2A-B56 in EGFR signaling that contributes to PDAC progression.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Fusion of male and female gametes of the same genotype results in self-fertilization (\"selfing\"), while \"outcrossing\" occurs between gametes of different parasite genotypes. Previous work has used PCR-based methods to assess oocyst genotypes in laboratory crosses and natural mosquito infections, revealing either random mating or inbreeding, but this approach is labor intensive and prone to technical issues. We generated florescent-labelled clones of NF54 (mCherry), an African parasite, and NHP4026 (GFP), a Thai parasite, crossed these parasites, and scored genotypes of 8540 oocysts from 435 mosquitoes sampled from 7 to 14 days post infection. We observed decreasing proportions of outcrossed oocysts and increasing levels of inbreeding over the course of the infection in two independently replicated crosses. These results are consistent with the faster maturation of transmissible sporozoites derived from outcrossed compared with selfed oocysts. We also found that selfed NF54 oocysts were larger than outcrossed and selfed NHP4026 oocysts. Our results reveal outcrossing advantages, perhaps due to outcrossing allowing for the removal of deleterious mutations accumulated during asexual parasite replication in the vertebrate host. Oocyst genotype significantly impacts oocyst size which may influence production of sporozoites and onward transmission. Overall, fluorescent labelling provides clear resolution of mating patterns, temporal dynamics and transmission potential of malaria parasites in mosquitoes. Importantly, faster maturation of outcrossed parasites can maximize levels of recombination in transmitted malaria parasite populations.\n\nSignificance StatementThe dynamics of malaria infection in the mosquito midgut, where gametes fuse to form a diploid zygote and then undergo meiosis and recombination, are difficult to study. We used fluorescent labelling of parental parasites to allow direct visualization of gamete fusion patterns in malaria parasite genetic crosses. Sampling during parasite development in the mosquito midgut revealed reductions in the proportions of outcrossed oocysts and an associated increase in inbreeding over time, consistent with faster maturation and release of transmissible sporozoites from outcrossed parasites compared with selfed parasites. These results are consistent with an outcrossing advantage for malaria parasites.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Activation of beige adipocytes enhances energy expenditure and promotes metabolic health, presenting a promising approach for combating obesity and diabetes. As part of this process, thermogenesis, fueled by uncoupled mitochondrial respiration, plays a central role in converting calories into thermal energy, thereby preventing their storage as fat. Here, we identify a role for exosome trafficking as an intrinsic regulator of beige adipocyte thermogenesis. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that mediate cell-cell and intracellular communication by transporting regulatory cargo, including microRNAs, proteins, and lipids. Using both human cells and mouse models, we show that thermogenic activation of beige adipocytes promotes the rapid release of exosomes enriched in microRNAs known to suppress thermogenic programs. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of exosome secretion attenuates thermogenesis, whereas enhancing exosome release amplifies thermogenic output. Mice deficient in the exosome secretion regulator Rab27a exhibit reduced energy expenditure in response to both cold exposure and {beta}3-adrenergic stimulation. These findings establish exosome trafficking as a key contributor to beige adipocyte thermogenic capacity, highlighting an intracellular mechanism that may be leveraged to enhance energy expenditure and treat obesity-related metabolic diseases.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

URAT1 function depends on binding the multi-PDZ domain scaffold protein PDZK1 (NHERF3), with a similar role suggested for related NHERF1. The molecular basis of these interactions remains poorly understood. Using fluorescence anisotropy, we show that full-length human PDZK1 binds the C-terminal peptide of URAT1 with high affinity (KD 170 nM), unlike NHERF1 (KD >70 {micro}M). The PDZ1 domain of PDZK1 alone is sufficient for high-affinity binding (KD 160 nM), while PDZ4 provides a secondary site (KD 1.35 {micro}M), with both interactions characterized by rapid kinetics. Gel filtration shows that PDZK1 can bind two URAT1 peptides. X-ray structures of individual PDZ domains from PDZK1 and NHERF1 complexed with the URAT1 peptide reveal the molecular determinants for PDZK1s higher affinity and selectivity. Murine Pdzk1 and Nherf1 bind Urat1 with high affinity indicating species-specific interactions.

Rag GTPases recruit mTORC1 to lysosomes, its intracellular activation site. Unexpectedly, we found that deleting RagA/B in rTECs, despite inhibiting mTORC1, triggers renal cystogenesis and kidney failure. We identify TFEB as the key driver of cystogenesis downstream of RagA/B loss and show that Rag GTPases, rather than mTORC1, are the primary suppressors of TFEB in vivo. We further highlight increased nuclear TFEB as a shared feature of several RCD models, whereas differences in mTORC1 activity may explain variable mTORC1 inhibitor efficacy. Finally, we provide evidence that nuclear TFEB, rather than mTORC1 activation, is a more consistent biomarker of cyst-lining epithelial cells in ADPKD. Overall, these findings challenge the prevailing view that mTORC1 hyperactivation is required for renal cystogenesis, which has important translational implications.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce MOTUM (Motion Online Tracking Under MRI), a novel system that combines real-time kinematic tracking with immersive virtual reality, enabling participants to perform naturalistic movements inside the scanner. As a proof-of-concept, we tested MOTUM during a reach-to-grasp task with and without visual feedback of one's hand (N = 7). The system achieved high-fidelity motion tracking, induced an intense immersive experience, evoked expected sensorimotor brain activations, and maintained high fMRI data quality. Standard fMRI control metrics were below the critical threshold in 99% of volumes, indicating that participants' arm movements had minimal impact on head motion and data quality. While hand movements had little to no effect on brain activity, arm movements resulted in sparse spurious correlations that were easily controlled for. Critically, MOTUM allowed us to extract rich kinematic indices and link them directly to brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis. Parametric modulation analyses revealed that natural variations in movement dynamics significantly influenced neural responses in parietal, frontal, and occipital regions. In sum, MOTUM is a robust method to study motor control and beyond, enabling a new class of fMRI experiments that bridge ecological realism and experimental control, pushing current neuroimaging research towards real-life neuroscience.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

To ensure that diverse genetic lines can be preserved, methods must be developed to cryopreserve gametes and embryos. We have previously reported methods for cryopreservation of sperm, but robust methods to preserve embryos remained lacking.\n\nResultsHere, we describe a relatively simple method to cryopreserve late gastrulae embryos of L. pictus. Importantly we show that, after thawing and culturing, the embryos progress through larval development, undergo metamorphosis and yield juvenile adults, indicating the method is robust.\n\nConclusionThe cryopreservation of embryos is an important advance that will facilitate the biobanking, sharing and long-term preservation of diverse genetic lines.

There is growing emphasis on investigating heterogeneity in resistance training (RT) outcomes, likely motivated by observations of substantial gross variability in training effects. However, gross variability does not necessarily represent true inter-individual response variation (IRV) and can be obscured by measurement error, sampling variance, and biological variability. Appropriate study design and statistical analysis are required to distinguish IRV from these confounding sources of within-participant variation. Methods. 16 recreationally trained participants completed a novel replicated within-participant unilateral design across two 11-week training phases separated by a 6-8 week washout. Lower limbs were randomized to a low volume (~8 sets/week) or high volume (~16 sets/week) training protocol in each phase. We assessed both general (GEN; average response across conditions) and condition-specific (CON; difference between volumes) IRV for vastus lateralis cross-sectional area and leg press one-repetition maximum using a multi-stage statistical approach. Results. Higher weekly set volumes demonstrated a detectable advantage for muscle hypertrophy (1.8 cm2 [95% HDI: 0.29, 3.41]; 98.77% posterior probability) but not maximal strength (3.48 kg [95% HDI: -5.1, 12.15]; 80.01% posterior probability). Despite substantial gross variability, we failed to detect irrefutable evidence of meaningful IRV. Integrated methods revealed stronger evidence for GEN versus CON IRV, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.67 to 0.7 for GEN versus 0.04 to 0.06 for CON. Conclusions. Our findings clearly illustrate that gross variability in training outcomes does not necessarily indicate true inter-individual differences, a distinction critical for both research and practice.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

H.; Beckstead, M.

Synaptic transmission is broadly disrupted in AD, but it is not known to what extent altered excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the VTA influence dopaminergic activity and output. Here we describe enhanced synaptic excitation in dopamine neurons in the amyloid + tau-driven 3xTg-AD mouse model. AMPAR-mediated excitatory input was enhanced in a subset of connections, while GABAAR-mediated inhibition decreased as a function of dendritic atrophy. The strengthened excitation appeared to depend on presynaptic protein kinase C (PKC) activity as well as postsynaptic AMPA receptor enhancement. Biophysical modeling predicted that synaptic changes, in combination with altered dendritic morphology and previously described intrinsic hypersensitivity, produce increased firing and a steeper input-output relationship. These results suggest that AD pathology is associated with increased input-output gain in single dopamine neurons, which may function to maintain phasic dopamine signaling in early stages of axonal degeneration.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In this work, we examine how NE influences different preBotC neuronal subtypes by modeling its effects through modulating two key parameters: calcium-activated nonspecific cationic current gating conductance (gCAN) and inositol-triphosphate (IP3), guided by experimental studies. Our computational model captures the experimentally observed differential effects of NE on distinct preBotC bursting patterns. We show that this dual mechanism is critical for inducing conditional bursting and identify specific parameter regimes where silent neurons remain inactive in the presence of NE. Furthermore, using methods of dynamical systems theory, we uncover the mechanisms by which NE differentially modulates burst frequency and duration in NaP-dependent and CAN-dependent bursting neurons.

This study documents the first confirmed occurrence of P. volitans in the reef environment of the Parcel de Manuel Luis Marine State Park, located on the Brazilian Equatorial Margin. The record was based on underwater footage collected during a scientific expedition in June 2025. Two individuals were observed near the wreck of the ship Ana Cristina at a depth of five meters.

Physicochemical variables measured at the site confirmed stable tropical marine conditions, including high salinity and temperature, compatible with the ecological tolerance of the species. Additional measurements at eight surrounding stations revealed minimal stratification, reinforcing the environmental suitability for the species. Statistical analysis detected no significant differences in salinity or dissolved oxygen between surface and bottom waters, and a slight variation in temperature. The presence of P. volitans in a conservation unit raises concern about its potential expansion into other reef and coastal environments. Given its high reproductive capacity, absence of natural predators, and ecological plasticity, the species poses a serious threat to native biodiversity and trophic dynamics.

The biological process of aging causes decreased control of the circadian system that is accompanied by a decline in memory performance, suggesting that these two processes may be linked. Indeed, our previous work has shown that in male mice, the clock gene Per1 functions within the dorsal hippocampus to exert diurnal control over memory and repression of Per1 in the old hippocampus contributes to age-related impairments in spatial memory. Although it is clear that Per1 may be a key molecular link between memory and the circadian rhythm, next to nothing is known about how sex impacts this role in the young or old brain. Here, we are interested in understanding how the factors of sex and age impact memory performance, circadian activity patterns, sleep behavior, and hippocampal Per1 expression. Methods We used a combination of spatial memory (Object Location Memory (OLM)) and circadian activity monitoring to determine how male and female mice change across the lifespan. In addition, we used RT-qPCR to quantify the change in Per1 levels in response to learning in young and old, male and female mice. Results Young female mice resist diurnal oscillations in memory, showing robust spatial memory across the diurnal cycle. In contrast, old female mice show an emergence of diurnal memory oscillations, with better memory during the day than at night (similar to what we observed previously in young male mice). In contrast, old male mice showed better memory performance during the night than the day, suggesting that their peak memory performance is drastically shifted compared to young males. We also measured activity patterns and sleep behavior across the diurnal cycle and found that sex was more of an influence than age in multiple analyses, but age did have an impact, with old male mice showing stronger circadian rhythm disruptions than any other cohort. Finally, we investigated whether the circadian clock gene Per1 plays a role in these sex- and age-dependent effects in diurnal memory performance. We found that, in general, learning-induced Per1 and memory performance peaked at similar times of day in each group, consistent with our hypothesis that Per1 exerts diurnal control over memory performance. Conclusions This work supports a role for Per1 in exerting diurnal control over memory and suggests that Per1 may be an appealing therapeutic target to improve memory and circadian dysfunction in old age.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In this work, we introduce RNArank, a novel deep learning-based approach to both local and global quality assessment of predicted RNA 3D structure models. For a given structure model, RNArank extracts a comprehensive set of multi-modal features and processes them with a Y-shaped residual neural network. This network is trained to predict two intermediate 2D maps, including the inter-nucleotide contact map and the distance deviation map. These maps are then used to estimate the local and global accuracy (i.e., lDDT). Extensive benchmark tests indicate that RNArank consistently outperforms traditional methods and other deep learning-based methods. Moreover, RNArank demonstrates promising performance in identifying high-quality structure models for targets from the recent CASP15 and CASP16 experiments. We anticipate that RNArank will serve as a valuable tool for the RNA biology community, improving the reliability of RNA structure modeling and thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of RNA function.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we focus on the chromatin-associated lncRNA PVT1, whose splicing efficiency at specific 3 splice sites predicts expression of distal genes in breast cancer. Using elastic net modeling across hundreds of breast cancer samples, we identify PVT1 splicing activity as a predictor of gene expression signatures enriched in miR-200/205 targets. Causal inference analysis using tumor-specific SNVs confirms that perturbation of splicing at specific sites alters the expression of distal gene sets enriched in miR-200/205 targets. We suggest a mechanistic model in which inefficient splicing and intron retention expose intronic miR-200 seed sites, perfect 7-mers, found exclusively within PVT1 introns, enabling PVT1 to function as a chromatin-associated lncRNA with intron-retained competing endogenous (ceRNA) activity. Artificial splicing enhancement of PVT1 in vitro with CASFx altered the expression of miR-200 target genes supporting this model. A genome-wide screen for intronic miR-200 seed sites, and splicing-based modeling across additional lncRNAs and protein-coding genes, identified PVT1 as a top candidate for splicing-modulated intron-retained ceRNA activity. Cross-tissue model generalization to prostate cancer supports the broader relevance of PVT1 splicing-based regulation. Our results highlight the regulatory potential of lncRNA splicing activity in trans, suggesting that chromatin-tethered, intron-retained lncRNAs such as PVT1 may serve as key post-transcriptional regulators in cancer.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In this study, a landscape genetics approach is applied to investigate the genetic structure, diversity, and connectivity of two sympatric carnivore species, i.e. the European pine marten (Martes martes) and the stone marten (Martes foina) in Croatia and Slovenia. We analysed mitochondrial DNA sequences for both species and additionally used nuclear microsatellite markers for the pine marten. A total of 211 individuals (29 pine martens and 182 stone martens) from both mainland and island populations were analysed. For pine marten, we found a significant genetic structuring, with pronounced differentiation between island and mainland populations, and a further substructure within the mainland. No significant isolation by distance was detected (Mantel test, p = 0.15), suggesting that genetic differentiation is driven more by habitat discontinuities and anthropogenic barriers rather than geographical distance alone. In contrast, stone marten exhibited weak genetic structure and high genetic diversity, indicating gene flow and potential landscape permeability for this more synanthropic species. These contrasting patterns underscore species-specific responses to landscape fragmentation and highlight the need to tailor management strategies accordingly.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here we address this question using data from 371 patients recorded intracranially who performed a free recall task with encoding and retrieval phases alongside an arithmetic distractor phase. We ask whether neural decoders fit to predict behavior from one phase transfer to the others. Encoding-retrieval transfer exceeds both arithmetic-encoding and arithmetic-retrieval transfer and therefore cannot be explained solely by processes supporting arithmetic. We further detect transfer between arithmetic and retrieval but not between arithmetic and encoding. The brain-behavioral relations observed in these tasks thus do not merely reflect a single task-general factor of activity.

We used 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine age- and alcohol-related associations with six neurometabolites in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) that are involved in key neural functions: glutamate + glutamine (Glx), GABA plus macromolecules (GABA+), total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), total choline (tCho), total creatine (tCr), and myo-inositol (mI). Participants were 84 adolescents (ages 17-22; 67% female) who completed MRS scans and self-reported past-60-day alcohol use via a modified Timeline Followback survey. Alcohol use variables included total drinking days, total binge drinking days, total number of drinks, and drinks per drinking day. Older adolescents had higher levels of GABA+, tNAA, tCho, and mI, and lower levels of Glx and Glx/GABA+; tCr was not associated with age. More alcohol use - specifically more drinking days, binge drinking days, and number of drinks - was associated with lower tNAA levels. Findings suggest age-related variation in dACC neurometabolites, which potentially reflect ongoing neuronal maturation, myelination, and shifts in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Lower tNAA among heavier drinkers may reflect associations between alcohol exposure and neuronal damage. Broader neurometabolic effects may emerge only with heavier or prolonged alcohol use.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

A.; Schechtman, E.", "abstract": "Reactivation of recently acquired memories during sleep supports their longevity. Reactivation can be biased during sleep using odors or sounds through a technique termed targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Here, we attempted to selectively weaken memories by reactivating them together with forgetting instructions. We delivered sounds to reactivate spatial memories and concurrent odors to reactivate instructions. Participants learned about the instructions in a Directed-Forgetting task performed with a list of to-be-remembered and to-be-forgotten words. One odor was linked with instructions to forget, one with instructions to remember, and a third was not assigned any meaning. During a nap, sounds previously linked with object-location learning were presented with these odors. Spatial recall was tested after sleep. Sounds produced a selective recall benefit for weakly encoded memories. However, results did not support the prediction that forgetting could be instilled by the concurrent forget odor. The encoding-strength-dependent benefit was greatest when sounds were presented together with the odor not assigned meaning, whereas the other two odors both disrupted sound-induced memory reactivation. We infer that remember and forget odors, due to the linked instructions and/or multiple learning episodes in the Directed-Forgetting task, evoked sleep-based retrieval that interfered with reactivation of spatial memories. Odors also induced a prolonged decline in sigma EEG power (12-16 Hz) that continued at least 10 s after odor offset. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of memory consolidation during sleep when multiple memories and multiple cues are involved.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we used single-cell transcriptomic profiling to investigate cell subpopulation-specific responses to bexarotene, an RXR agonist, in APP/PS1 mice. Our analysis revealed that bexarotene activated cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism transcriptional programs in homeostatic astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Astrocytes also upregulated neurodevelopmental genes, while oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells showed enhanced protein folding and cellular growth pathways. Bexarotene further modulated immune responses, promoting A{beta}-responsive signatures in disease-associated microglia and reactive astrocytes, while dampening pro-inflammatory responses in homeostatic microglia and endothelial cells. Furthermore, Apoe expression was significantly elevated across multiple cell types, especially in microglia and oligodendrocytes. Cell-cell communication analysis highlighted increased astrocyte-centered signaling, with APOE-driven pathways emerging as a prominent mediator.

These genes include NYX, GRM6, TRPM1, GPR179, and LRIT3, and the cCSNB phenotype that results is characterized by abnormal low light vision, myopia, and nystagmus, but does not include retinal degeneration.

Here, we investigated whether CD206+ macrophages in the meninges play a role in regulating nociception and pain hypersensitivity. Methods: We selectively depleted CD206+ macrophages in the meninges around the lumbar spinal cord by intrathecal administration of anti-CD206 coupled to saporin, and determined the effects of CD206+ macrophage depletion on responses in naive rats and in those that had received a skin incision to the upper hindlimb. In addition, we used RNAseq to investigate transcriptional changes in lumbar meninges and dorsal root ganglia. Experiments were done in both male and female rats. Results: Depleting CD206+ meningeal macrophages did not alter basal responses in naive animals of either sex. By contrast depleting these cells after skin injury induced mechanical hypersensitivity in male rats, without changes in thermal sensitivity but had no effect in females. In male rats with skin incision injury, we found that the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by depleting CD206+ meningeal macrophages was reversed by administering the NMDAR antagonist, APV. In addition, the hypersensitivity was reversed by an enhancer of KCC2 function, CLP290. Unexpectedly, skin incision caused significant transcriptional changes in the meninges, but only in male rats. Conclusions: Taken together, our results indicate that while CD206+ meningeal macrophages do not regulate basal nociception in naive rats, after skin incision injury, these cells mask mechanical hypersensitivity in male rats only. Thus, we conclude that in a sex-dependent manner CD206+ meningeal macrophages prevent the spread of pain hypersensitivity after a minor injury. Importantly, the skin incision we used was comparable to that used in sham controls in numerous rodent studies of neuropathic pain. Our findings have, therefore, potentially broad implications for re-interpreting results from previous neuropathic pain research.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Adult male and female mice received either a single impact or nine daily impacts. Linear and angular acceleration data were analyzed alongside behavioral and histological outcomes. Our apparatus delivered consistent impact and velocity forces with minimal inter-subject variability. Additionally, the animals exhibited consistent linear and angular acceleration when measured using high-speed video capture. Mice in the rmTBI model showed an increased return of righting reflex (RoRR) time, indicating cumulative effects of injury on return to consciousness. Behavioral testing revealed reduced performance of rmTBI-affected mice in an olfaction-mediated foraging task (buried food task), particularly at later timepoints, consistent with progressive olfactory impairment. Immunohistochemical analysis of Iba1 and CD68 in the brain demonstrated sex-dependent microglial activation, with males showing higher expression levels in single- and nine-impact models. Brain region-specific effects were most pronounced in the corpus callosum, neocortex, and olfactory tubercle.

However, the lack of cross-reactivity with rodent TfR1 limits the utility of standard animal models for preclinical testing. To overcome this challenge, we generated knock in (KI) rats in which the coding sequences of the endogenous Tfrc and Tf genes were replaced with human coding sequences, yielding animals that express human TfR1 and/or human TF under physiological control. Rats homozygous for both humanized alleles were viable and fertile, indicating that the human proteins can functionally replace their rodent equivalents. Nonetheless, these double homozygous rats exhibited erythropoietic abnormalities and tissue-specific alterations in iron distribution, characterized by decreased splenic and increased hepatic iron, suggesting incomplete functional compensation. In contrast, heterozygous rats showed only mild, subclinical hematologic changes (microcytosis and hypochromia). These findings demonstrate that the humanized TfR1 TF axis is compatible with life and iron regulation, albeit with varying degrees of compensation depending on gene dosage.

In addition to their role in learning, neuromodulators have been suggested to play a role in sensory processing at relatively fast timescales (less than a second), although the precise mechanisms at play are still not well understood. To assess the potential computational role of neuromodulators in sensory processing, we added a simple but flexible model of neuromodulation to spiking neural networks. These networks were then trained - with methods from machine learning - to carry out challenging sensory processing tasks. We find that this addition leads to a dramatic improvement in sensory processing in every task and configuration we tested. In particular, we find that without explicitly training for this, it decreases reaction times, a role that has been discussed for the cholinergic system. In a particularly challenging speech recognition in noise task, we find that the networks learn to make use of rapid dynamic gain control via excitability, an attentional mechanism akin to the \"listening in the dips\" strategy. This has been hypothesised to be a key element of human hearing allowing us to perform better in these conditions than even state-of-the-art machine learning systems. We conclude that neuromodulation does have the potential to play a significant computational role in fast sensory processing.

Here, we investigated nine yeast species in two taxonomic orders that are close outgroups to S. cerevisiae. We find that they have a wide diversity of centromere structures, indicating that multiple transitions of structure have occurred within the last 200 Myr. Some species have centromeres with defined sequence motifs (17 - 200 bp), others consist of Inverted Repeats (IRs), and others have Ty5-like retroelement clusters. Strikingly, the chromosomal locations of centromeres have largely been conserved across taxonomic orders, even as their structures have changed, which suggests that structure replacement occurs in situ. In some Barnettozyma species we find that a single genome can contain chromosomes with different centromere structures - some with IRs and some without - which suggests that a structural transition is underway in this genus.

The pban gene is conserved across the insects and encodes pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) and 1-3 additional pyrokinins. The pban gene of the basal Diptera resembles that of other insect Orders while in more derived Diptera (where it is referred to as the hugin gene) the PBAN peptide coding sequence is absent and another peptide, hugin, serves novel functions in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this paper, structural models are generated for the pyrokinins PBAN and g-SGNP and their receptor PBANR of the basal species Aedes aegypti, and hugin and its receptor PK2_1 of the more derived Drosophila melanogaster. The binding pockets for all three peptides overlap even when amino acids are non-synonymous between the two species. Peptide C-terminal core sequences preferentially bind more conserved transmembrane regions of the receptor while the variable N-terminal peptide residues are relegated to less conserved sites in the extracellular loops. The PBAN peptide forms rigid secondary and tertiary structures with its long N-terminus, binding unique amino acids in the extracellular loops of PBANR, providing a basis for functional differentiation from the short and flexible g-SGNP peptide. A kink introduced into the full peptide backbones by proline residues directs the N-terminus along the surface of the ECLs, suggesting roles for secondary and tertiary structure in peptide recognition. D. melanogaster hugin binds residues that contact PBAN in A. aegypti, suggesting that loss of PBAN in higher Diptera facilitated divergence of peptide-receptor interactions. This data provides a potential basis for differing roles of multiple peptides in A. aegypti, and coevolution of ligand and receptor in D. melanogaster that may have facilitated functional evolution.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In order to accomplish its goal (a stable nest), the brain appears to compare intermediate steps in the process to stored mental images, or templates. Deviations from these templates drive progress, preferences, and corrections in the execution of this behavior. The stereotypy vs. plasticity of both schema and mental templates have rarely been defined in an experimentally accessible system. Here we investigated nest building by the cichlid Lamprologus ocellatus, a fish species that manipulates abandoned snail shells to build shelters for breeding and protection. We find that nest building is composed of a sequence of behaviors that are tied together by a series of stimulus-response loops, allowing for restarts and shortcuts as the behavioral program unfolds. The attraction to a shell object is innate, as is the final appearance of the nest. The behavior in an inexperienced animal is initially uncoordinated, but is fine-tuned by repeated building opportunities. Shells need to conform to rigid geometric criteria in order to be acceptable as a potential home. Nest building is accompanied by focused neural activity in brain regions homologous to the mammalian hippocampus and neocortex.

We present a simple algorithm for determining the arrangement of functional elements of single DNA molecules which can be aggregated to provide a sensitive measure of the population of sequences in a sample, including minor species. Using data from four publicly available datasets, we demonstrate our algorithm is able to characterize nearly all of the species in the AAV samples.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

However, high sequencing error rates, diverse library architectures, and increasing dataset scale introduce major challenges for accurately identifying cell barcodes (CBCs) and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) - key prerequisites for reliable demultiplexing and deduplication, respectively. Existing pipelines rely on hard-coded heuristics or local transition rules that cannot fully capture this broader structural context and often fail to robustly interpret reads with indel-induced shifts, truncated segments, or non-canonical element ordering. We introduce Tranquillyzer (TRANscript QUantification In Long reads-anaLYZER), a flexible, architecture-aware deep learning framework for processing long-read single-cell RNA-seq data. Tranquillyzer employs a hybrid neural network architecture and a global, context-aware design, and enables precise identification of structural elements - even when elements are shifted, partially degraded, or repeated due to sequencing noise or library construction variability. In addition to supporting established single-cell protocols, Tranquillyzer accommodates custom library formats through rapid, one-time model training on user-defined label schemas, typically completed within a few hours on standard GPUs. Additional features such as scalability across large datasets and comprehensive visualization capabilities further position Tranquillyzer as a flexible and scalable framework solution for processing long-read single-cell transcriptomic datasets.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

However, such condensates in cellular media is often very much heterogeneous in nature in terms of proteins and even polynucleotides presence in different concentrations. Present study explores stability and dynamics of heterotypic coacervates formed by polyampholyte binary peptides having differential charge-clustering limits. Systematic increase in differential charge-clustering in peptide pairs tunes the origin of heterogeneity and shows an enhanced stability of droplet than homogeneous ones with same average charge clustering of the two peptide pairs. In addition, stability of the condensate phase enhances linearly with the increase of high charge-clustering polymers in the system. Peptides with higher charge-clustering are 3-4 times slower diffusive within condensate phase than the lower charge-clustering ones due to heterogeneity in structural morphology of droplets, that too diminish as one lowers the difference of charge-clustering among sequence pairs forming the condensate. Coupled to the differential diffusivity of the polymers in condensates, droplet diffusion is nearly 7-35 times lower than bulk depending upon the mixing ratios of the polymers and variable sequence charge-clustering. Condensates with mild heterogeneity have shown an enhanced arrestation than the most heterogeneous ones originating from complementarity and better packing probed by energetics in the condensate. This study quantifies fundamental microscopic properties of heterotypic condensates formed through long-range electrostatic forces and particularly how they can be modulated by the differential charge-pattern in sequences and mixing fraction systematically.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

We developed a generalizable strategy to discover event-driven CIPs by tracking the cellular effects of heterobifunctional small molecules alongside quantitative measures of intracellular target engagement. Using this approach, we discovered PCIP-1, which inhibits DNA repair by recruiting BET proteins to PARP2. Unlike conventional PARP inhibitors, PCIP-1 activity is observed at low equilibrium occupancy of PARP1/2 and without inhibition of PARP-catalyzed PARylation, yet it retains synthetic lethality in cancer cells with homologous recombination deficiencies. PARP1 knockout, which confers resistance to conventional PARP drugs, increases sensitivity to PCIP-1, offering a potential new mechanism to overcome clinical resistance.

Additionally, even though a negative relationship between warming and body size has been established in recent marine ectotherms, the environmental and mechanistic drivers of the Lilliput effect are still debated. We compiled close to 9000 body size changes from fossil, historical and modern body size studies, to show that a decrease in body size is indeed a general response of marine ectotherms to environmental crises. The magnitude and temporal variability of size changes at the species-level are significantly higher during hyperthermal than non-hyperthermal events, suggesting differing mechanisms of body size decrease depending on the environmental stressor. Our results further show that ancient environmental perturbations with a higher magnitude of warming were associated with a greater dwarfing. This implies that warming was a major driver of body size decreases during hyperthermal events throughout the Phanerozoic, and future warming will impact current trajectories of body size reduction in modern marine ectotherms.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

The prevailing disequilibrium, stemming from hyperactivation of the glutamatergic system, culminates in progressive neuronal impairment and cognitive deterioration. This study aimed to elucidate the contributory role of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7), identified as the second most critical genetic determinant in AD, in glutamatergic-associated neurotoxicity. This endeavor sought to advance molecular comprehension of neurological disorders where Glu-GABA neurotransmission represents a pivotal pharmacotherapeutic target. Utilizing multi-omics approaches, we rigorously analyzed four distinct mouse models, both with and without APPtg and ABCA7 expression, to simulate varied pathological and ABCA7-deficient states. Our results revealed amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition as a catalyst for surging glutamatergic transmission. Notably, ABCA7 ablation exacerbated glutamatergic-induced neurotoxicity, attributed to diminished enzymatic activity related to neurotransmitter degradation and amplified expression levels of specific neurotransmitter transport proteins and receptor subunits, notably NMDA, AMPA, and GABAA. These findings furnish the first comprehensive description elucidating ABCA7's amplification of neurotoxic effects through modulation of Glu-GABA neurotransmission systems in neurodegenerative contexts, primarily mediated by lipid interaction. The evidence underscores ABCA7's imperative role in shaping future pharmacological strategies aimed at counteracting neurodegeneration precipitated by Glu-mediated neurotoxicity.

A major barrier that stands between implementing these findings into effective clinical treatments is the translational gap between rodent models and human patients. To date, no methods or protocols describe how to prepare viable human spinal cord slices for acute electrophysiological recordings. To bridge this translational divide, we describe here a protocol for the extraction of spinal cord tissue from consenting human organ donors and the preparation and sectioning of this tissue for acute spinal cord slice electrophysiology. With the collaboration of a transplant service and licensed surgeon, tissue can be extracted in 30-50 minutes. Acute spinal cord slices can then be prepared in the laboratory by trained graduate students in 2.5-5 hours, depending on the amount of tissue and scope of experiments. Using a viability stain to confirm that spinal slices are of sufficient quality to proceed, slices can then be used for either patch-clamp recordings to study the excitability of individual neurons or for high-density multielectrode array recordings to study intact sensory circuits. Slices remain viable for 4 to 8 hours, providing ample time for investigating synaptic and circuit-level signalling dynamics, including the use of pharmacological agents to probe the roles of specific molecular targets. The approaches described here can be implemented to improve translational physiological research and as a human tissue-based preclinical drug target identification and validation assay.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Neuronal excitability is tightly coupled with metabolic demand, and aberrant excitatory activity -observed in AD patients and models- can drive changes in metabolism. While A{beta}-related metabolic impairments are well-described, less is known about how tau pathology independently contributes to altered metabolic states and excitatory tone. Therefore, we explored how tau pathology impacted whole body and CNS metabolism in mouse models of tauopathy, including the P301S PS19 and Tau4RTg2652 mice. In both models, hyperphosphorylated tau prevents the age-related decline in whole-body metabolism by preserving glucose tolerance and mitigating shifts in fuel utilization (respiratory exchange ratio; RER), suggesting the mice are glucose needy. Tau pathology also preserves diurnal rhythms in hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose and lactate, likely due to increased neuronal activity during the active (dark) phase. Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics following 13C-glucose administration revealed that glucose is preferentially shunted toward glutamate synthesis- at the expense of GABA- highlighting a shift in excitatory/inhibitory balance. Interestingly, these changes were not explained by a primary deficit in synaptic mitochondria but by alterations in glycolytic flux. Adaptations were time of day dependent, where ISF glutamate rises after a glucose injection in the dark period but not the light period. This suggests increased glutamatergic activity may drive metabolic demand during the dark period when mice are more active. Together, these studies fundamentally highlight the important coupling between metabolism and excitability, which is disrupted by hyperphosphorylated tau, tau aggregation, and neurodegeneration. Understanding how tau pathology and metabolism interrelate provides a novel lens for the development of therapeutic targets in late stage AD.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Upon activation by ER calcium depletion or ligand binding, S1R can increase calcium efflux from the ER into the mitochondria by chaperoning IP3 receptor type3 (Ip3R3). Mitochondrial metabolism has an intricate relationship with glycolysis. Despite S1R affecting mitochondria, the relevance of S1R to glycolysis and its impact on the overall cellular energy metabolism is not known. This study utilizes wild-type (Wt) and S1R knockout (S1R KO) Neuro2a (N2a) cells and Wt and S1R KO mice for primary culture of cortical neurons studies and longitudinal in-vivo imaging. In this manuscript we describe the fundamental functions of S1R on glycolysis, mitochondrial activity and NAD+/NADH metabolism, keystone coenzymes essential for glycolysis and for mitochondrial activity. Both N2a cells and cortical neurons lacking S1R had reduced glycolytic activity, and increased mitochondria complex I protein GRIM19 but no change in mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Furthermore, we observed an increased NAD+/NADH ratio in S1R KO condition. Positron emission tomography revealed decreased [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose brain uptake in S1R KO mice. We observed that knocking down GRIM19 in S1R KO condition rescued the glycolysis deficit. Altogether, these data show for the first time that S1R modulates glycolysis and NAD metabolism in various neuronal systems.

Here, we identify Sp100-HMG, an Sp100 isoform, as a driver of PML NBs formation via LLPS, recruiting PML and accessory proteins (DAXX, ATRX). Dissection of this assembly process uncovered a hierarchical mechanism orchestrated by three distinct yet cooperative processes: I. Multimerization domain- and intrinsically disordered region (IDR)-mediated LLPS of Sp100-HMG, nucleating the initial core; II. C-terminal-dependent protein-protein interactions that enrich client components; and III. SUMOylation-directed PML recruitment, facilitating the formation of a stabilizing peripheral shell. Notably, this assembly paradigm extends beyond Sp100-HMG, as evidenced by ZBTB16, a PML NB-associated oncoprotein implicated in acute promyelocytic leukemia adopting an analogous mechanism to organize PML-positive condensates. Functional validation further revealed that Sp100-HMG positive PML NBs exert dual regulatory control over transcriptional programs and cell cycle progression, highlighting their pleiotropic roles. Critically, this work redefines the canonical PML NB assembly model by demonstrating that Sp100-HMG, rather than PML, acts as a primary scaffold, with PML polymerization relegated to a secondary, shell-forming stabilizer.

Alpha cells exhibit enhanced immune-like gene expression compared to beta cells. We also found that the tumour suppressor Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3), a T1D risk gene, is highly expressed in beta cells while almost undetectable in alpha cells. These observations were confirmed by analysing bulk RNA-sequencing data from fluorescence-activated cell-sorted alpha and beta cells isolated from primary human islets from non-diabetic donors. Additionally, MEG3 knockdown in human insulin-producing EndoC-{beta}H1 cells and human islets microtissues decreased cytokine-induced damage and apoptosis, preserving beta-cell function under inflammatory conditions. The fact that alpha cells exhibit increased immune-like and anti-apoptotic activity as compared to beta cells suggests that they are better equipped to endure the autoimmune assault in T1D.

The LLPS of Spef1 is mediated by its C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. Crystallography reveals that the Spef1-CC domain forms a parallel CC dimer with a unique charge distribution pattern on the surface. The dimerization capacity and charge distribution of Spef1-CC are both critical for controlling in-vitro LLPS. Disruption of the dimerization capacity abolishes ciliary functions of Spef1.

A major challenge in studying this dynamic assembly process has been the difficult to distinguish newly forming NPCs from their mature counterparts. Here, we present a powerful nanobody-based approach that overcomes this limitation. Using pulsed-labelling mass spectrometry, conventional and super resolution live-cell imaging, and correlative light and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that a nanobody targeting the nucleoporin Nic96 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae selectively binds newly synthesized Nic96 subcomplexes prior to their incorporation into NPCs. Importantly, the nanobody does not disrupt NPC assembly, nuclear transport, cell growth, or lifespan, and shows no genetic interactions with known NPC assembly surveillance pathways - making it an ideal, non-perturbing tool to study NPC biogenesis in yeast. We use the Nic96 nanobody to reveal distinct assembly rates between haploid and diploid cells and to visualize early stages of assembly. We show that newly synthesized nucleoporins accumulate on Pdr16- and Ldo16-positive lipid droplets near the nucleus-vacuole junction. This suggests a regulatory balance between NPC incorporation and nucleoporin sequestration, potentially buffering assembly kinetics or targeting unassembled subunits for degradation.

Here, using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy we find that sperm-specific SUN5 localizes to the base of the human sperm head and by applying in situ cryo-electron tomography we find an extensive two-dimensional lattice in the nuclear envelope at this region. Moreover, this lattice appears to maintain a consistent close apposition between the inner and outer nuclear membranes. Further structural analysis supports a model in which SUN5 forms trimers that laterally interact at the outer nuclear membrane. Overall, this study sheds light on nuclear envelope organization in the highly streamlined sperm cell, providing mechanistic insights into uniform nuclear envelope spacing maintained by a LINC lattice and rationalizing disruptive effects of SUN5 mutations on the sperm head-tail junction.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

L.; Myllymaki, S.-M.", "abstract": "Branching morphogenesis is a fundamental developmental process that shapes the architecture of many epithelial organs, including the mammary gland. In essence, it enables epithelia with cylindrical geometry to grow in a tree-like pattern through repeated cycles of elongation and branching. In the mammary gland, branches form via tip splitting (bifurcation) and budding from the stalk (side-branching). Here, we utilize 3D confocal timelapse imaging of ex vivo cultured embryonic mammary glands and a variety of mouse models, to elucidate for the first time, how side branches form in the mammary epithelium. Our results show that branch formation is preceded by outward directional cell migration, whereas cell divisions or their orientation have a more minor contribution. We also demonstrate that frequency of branching increases substantially upon relaxation of epithelial actomyosin network, induced by deletion of Myh9. Interestingly, mosaic Myh9 ablation impedes cell movement amongst neighbors with higher contractility, suggesting that balancing of NMIIA-generated forces are needed for effective collective migration.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Lung injury leads to pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC) damage, disruption of cell-cell junctions, and increased permeability. Previously, we demonstrated in a mechanical ventilation-induced model of lung injury that aging exacerbated pulmonary microvascular permeability. Based on this, we hypothesized that aging was associated with increased PMVEC barrier dysfunction due to impaired cell-cell junction integrity. PMVEC were isolated from young and aged mice and cultured to confluence in vitro. Barrier function and cell-cell junction integrity were assessed through electric cell-substrate impedance sensing, XPerT permeability assay, immunofluorescence, and western blot analysis. Further studies were conducted to examine alterations in the proteome, markers of inflammation, and actin cytoskeleton organization. To model injurious conditions, PMVEC were stimulated with inflammatory cytokines; permeability and actin cytoskeletal alterations were subsequently assessed. We observed increased basal permeability in PMVEC from aged mice, which was associated with disrupted cell-surface localization of the adherens junction protein, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. Protein abundance of VE-cadherin was significantly increased with age; however, levels of the adapter protein, -catenin, and the tight junction protein, claudin-5, were decreased. Measures of inflammation, including cytokine expression and cell surface abundance of adhesion molecules, did not differ with age. Alterations in actin cytoskeleton organization, characterized by augmented presence of actin stress fibers, were observed in aged PMVEC. Under inflammatory conditions, permeability and actin stress fiber formation were exacerbated with age. It is concluded that aging predisposes PMVEC to elevated injury, due to inherent deficiencies in cell-cell junctions and barrier function, potentially mediated through altered actin cytoskeleton organization.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Retinal degenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa, and glaucoma, have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the impact of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation accumulation in the context of these retinopathies has yet to be thoroughly explored. Our previous studies focused on the retinal phenotype observed in the PolgD257A mutator mice (D257A), revealing the effects of aging and mtDNA mutation accumulation in the retina. We have reported that this model exhibited significant morphological and functional deficits in the retina by 6 months of age, with notable alterations in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) occurring as early as 3 months, including changes in the cristae density and reduction in length of mitochondria. This study investigated how mtDNA mutations affect the metabolic interaction between the retina and RPE in young (3 months) and old (12 months) wild-type (WT) and D257A mice. We assessed cellular energy production using freshly dissected retina samples from both groups through Seahorse analysis, immunofluorescence, and Western blot experiments. The analysis of aged D257A retina punches revealed significantly reduced basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration, along with increased mitochondrial reserve capacity compared to WT. However, glycolytic flux, measured as a function of extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), did not differ between WT and D257A mice. Both D257A retina and RPE exhibited decreased expression of essential electron transport proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, we observed a reduction in the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and lactate transporter (MCT1) at the apical surface of the RPE. Enzymes associated with glycolysis, including hexokinase II and lactate dehydrogenase A, were significantly lower in the aged D257A retina, while hexokinase I and pyruvate kinase 2 were upregulated in the RPE. These findings indicate that the accumulation of mtDNA mutations leads to impaired metabolism in both the retina and RPE. Furthermore, it suggests that glucose from the choroidal blood supply is being utilized by the RPE rather than transported to the neural retina. Mitochondrial dysfunction in RPE promotes a glycolytic state in these cells, leading to reduced availability of metabolites and, consequently, diminished overall retinal function. These results are essential for advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration and provide a new perspective on the role of mtDNA mutations in these diseases.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Using chromosome-level genome assemblies, RNA-seq from multiple tissues, and immunocytochemistry, we find that dosage compensation in somatic tissues and meiotic X inactivation are conserved despite the absence of selective pressure in all-female lineages. Surprisingly, expression data and cytological markers indicate that MSCI signatures are even stronger in parthenogenetic males, a pattern driven by prolonged autosomal transcription during meiosis. These results indicate that X-targeting DC and MSCI mechanisms are either weakly selected against or evolutionarily constrained, while autosomal mis-expressing during meiosis occurs rapidly following the relaxation of selection, shedding light on the stability of X chromosome regulation.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

While achieving clinical relevance requires biomarkers that generalize across diverse datasets, privacy concerns surrounding sensitive clinical and molecular data further restrict data sharing, impeding progress in biomarker discovery. Materials and Methods: We developed a scalable, cloud-based distributed pipeline, implemented as an in-silico simulation of federated learning, to enable privacy-preserving integration of clinical and molecular data across institutions. This approach supports the development of genomic prediction algorithms without sharing sensitive patient data. Using curated gene expression profiles, we evaluated the association of tumor microenvironment and IO gene expression signatures with clinical outcomes across pan-cancer, cancer-specific, and treatment-specific settings, and developed a multivariable distributed model to predict IO response. Results: We implemented an integrated meta-analysis pipeline using harmonized data across 18 datasets comprising 967 patients and seven cancer types treated with PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4, or combination immunotherapies. This approach identified biomarkers specific to lung cancer and CTLA-4 therapy previously unreported in pan-cancer and pan-IO analyses, highlighting the value of context-specific associations. Similar gene expression signatures were associated with progression-free survival and response in both pan-cancer and melanoma datasets, with notable overlap between dual checkpoint blockade and PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. Distributed multivariable XGBoost models outperformed the average of locally trained models, indicating improved generalizability.

We analyzed RNA-Seq data for lncRNA expression from a mouse model of HCM and cross-referenced transcripts to a published human HCM tissue dataset. We identified a total of 9,140 lncRNA transcripts in the mouse dataset, of which 35 were differentially expressed between transgenic TNNT2 delta160 mice (TG) and non-transgenic mice (nTG, p-adj < 0.05). Of these, 13 had a human ortholog as predicted by ortho2align. We used the computational tools MiPepid, AlphaFold, and PhyloCSF to predict potential micropeptides that could be coded for by these 13 mouse lncRNAs. We found that predicted micropeptides from 3 of these lncRNAs (G730003C15Rik, 9830004L10Rik, and Gm45012) have higher AlphaFold folding confidence metrics than random peptides or truly non-coding lncRNA negative controls (p < 0.05).

Epidermal growth factor-like protein 7 (EGFL7), a secreted pro-angiogenic factor that is highly expressed in the glioblastoma microenvironment (GME), has been implicated in immune evasion by other solid tumors, but its role in glioblastoma immune regulation remains unclear. Here, we studied the impact of EGFL7 in shaping the immune landscape in glioblastoma and identified underlying mechanisms. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of immune cells from glioblastoma models revealed that EGFL7 promotes an immunosuppressive GME, characterized by increased infiltration of pro-tumorigenic macrophages and enhanced T cell exhaustion. Mechanistically, EGFL7 interacts with integrin {beta}2 (ITGB2) on immune cells to mediate these effects. Genetic perturbation of the EGFL7-ITGB2 axis attenuated immunosuppression and significantly prolonged the survival of glioblastoma-bearing mice. In conclusion, our study provides unequivocal evidence that the EGFL7-ITGB2 axis acts as a critical mediator of immunosuppression in glioblastoma and represents a potential therapeutic target for reprogramming the GME to prevent immune evasion in glioblastoma.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

This systematic review evaluated and synthesized experimental models of increased maternal stress during pregnancy in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs share key pregnancy characteristics with humans, including relevant placental structure, maternal hormonal recognition of pregnancy and precocial offspring development. We identified 41 studies using various experimental approaches categorized into three main types: behavioral models, drug/substance exposure models, and physiological challenge models. These studies demonstrated significant fetal and offspring effects, particularly sex-specific neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, maternal physiological adaptations were often superficially characterized, focusing primarily on weight gain and occasional stress hormone measurements. Most studies began interventions during established pregnancy, potentially missing critical pre-pregnancy and early pregnancy periods.

Here, we investigated proteomic changes in the venom sac, the primary reservoir for venom storage, of Bombus terrestris workers over a short time-course post-envenomation. Our analysis reveals three key findings: 1) envenomation leads to changes in the venom sac proteome with affected proteins generally reduced in the bumblebee venom sac, suggestive of a molecular cost; 2) quantified reductions of traditional venom-associated proteins post-envenomation indicate changes in venom composition post-usage; and 3) recovery of reduced venom-associated proteins post-envenomation was delayed further indicating a potential cost at the molecular level associated with usage.

J.", "abstract": "The naked mole-rat (NMR) is renowned for being the longest-lived rodent, with a maximum lifespan of over 40 years. This exceptional longevity has been attributed to increased cytoprotective signaling, which has been partially ascribed to a major component of the NMRs extracellular matrix hyaluronan (HA), which has an unusually large molecular mass in this species. The HA molecular mass in the NMR is five to six times greater than in mice and humans. Mice expressing the transgene for NMR HA synthase 2 (nmrHas2), which is the enzyme that produces very high molecular mass HA (vHMM-HA), had improved health outcomes at an advanced age, such as improved mobility, grip strength, and reduced inflammation. Calorie restriction (CR) similarly improves healthspan in mice, and CR has also been shown to attenuate age-related hearing loss (AHL). Specifically, CR mitigates the effects of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the cadherin 23 (Cdh23) gene, which encodes a protein required for the stability of stereocilia on cochlear hair cells in mice and humans. Therefore, we hypothesized that AHL would be attenuated in nmrHas2+ mice. We performed auditory brainstem response testing on 3-month and 12-month-old mice with (nmrHas2+) and without (nmrHas2-) the NMR transgene. We observed AHL at 12 months of age in both nmrHas2+ and nmrHas2- mice, and AHL was not attenuated by nmrHas2 expression. This suggests that the cytoprotective effects of vHMM-HA work through a different pathway from CR, at least with respect to the inner ear.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Methods: Connectivity was calculated from electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 68 children with SeLECTS and 65 age and sex-matched controls using the weighted phase lag index. SeLECTS EEGs were categorized by epilepsy duration (shorter or longer than 6 months) to assess progressive connectivity changes. To investigate the impact of spikes on connectivity, 19 SeLECTS patients who underwent two EEGs were analyzed longitudinally, comparing those whose spikes persisted versus resolved over time. Analyses focused on connectivity during sleep. Results: Connectivity increased with epilepsy duration, being lowest in controls, intermediate in patients with shorter epilepsy duration, and highest in those with longer duration. Changes were initially greatest within the right occipital region and became more widespread with longer epilepsy duration. Longitudinally, patients with persistent spikes showed increasing connectivity over time, while those with spike resolution demonstrated decreasing connectivity, resulting in significant between-group differences. Conclusions: Functional connectivity in SeLECTS increases progressively with epilepsy duration and spike exposure, suggesting that ongoing spikes drive neural network alterations.

Older adults are more resilient to the effects of acute sleep loss and, depending on the cognitive domain, may be completely unaffected while younger adults suffer. To elucidate the brain network responses to sleep loss underlying these cognitive differences between age groups, we investigated the static and dynamic functional connectivity effects of sleep restriction (sleep limited to 3 hours) and how these effects differ between younger adults (20-30 years) and older adults (65-75 years). We found a functional connectivity subnetwork that was primarily strengthened in younger adults after sleep restriction but weakened in older adults after sleep restriction. Similar crossover interactions were consistently observed in further analyses of functional connectivity degree, modularity, and dynamic functional connectivity state fractional occupancy. Our findings demonstrate that the effect of sleep restriction on older adults is fundamentally different from younger adults. These results most strongly support the compensation theory of aging, which predicts a fundamental shift in the effects of sleep loss, rather than a mere dampening of the sleep benefits experienced by younger adults.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Overall social interactions were driven by a linear combination of song and taste. Aggression was driven by song, independent of taste cues. Courtship was controlled by a nonlinear integration of song and female taste cues, with female taste flipping the valence of song from suppressing to enhancing courtship.

Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is located on human chromosome 21 and is overproduced in Down syndrome. DSCAM is a receptor for netrin-1 and plays a critical role in neural wiring during brain development. Using a Dscam gain-of-function mouse model and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons, in combination with cellular, molecular, and behavioral approaches, this study aims to understand how DSCAM triplication and its subsequent excessive production contribute to changes in neural development and intellectual disability in Down syndrome. Analysis of morphological parameters revealed impaired neuronal development and loss of netrin-1-mediated axon guidance in mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons overexpressing DSCAM. DSCAM overexpression also reduces interhemispheric connectivity in vivo. Furthermore, we find that DSCAM overexpression leads to impaired hippocampal-dependent learning and reduced anxiety in adult mice. Down syndrome human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived excitatory pyramidal neurons exhibit a similar phenotype: impaired morphological development and loss of netrin-1-mediated axon guidance. Remarkably, normalization of DSCAM in Down syndrome human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons rescues many of these neuronal phenotypes, including reduced axon length and deficits in axon guidance. This study presents the first comprehensive cellular, molecular, and behavioural evidence that DSCAM is a significant contributor to multiple Down syndrome phenotypes, providing insight into a pathway for treatment.

However, whether HDAC inhibitors can protect photoreceptors in autosomal dominant RP (ADRP) remains unclear. Here, we utilized the recently generated human homologous RhoI255d/+ ADRP mouse model to investigate degenerative mechanisms and the therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors. To visualize photoreceptor HDAC activity, we applied an in situ HDAC activity assay on post-natal (P) day 20 wild type (WT) and RhoI255d/+ retina. Treatment with the HDAC class I/II inhibitor Trichostatin A and the HDAC class III inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) suggested that most HDAC activity detected in RhoI255d/+ photoreceptors was related to class I/II isoforms. The therapeutic potential of different HDAC inhibitors, targeting different HDAC isoforms, was evaluated on organotypic retinal explants cultured under completely controlled conditions. HDAC inhibitors tested included SAHA (Vorinostat), MPT0G211, ACY-957, and NAM. Readouts comprised the TUNEL assay, immunostaining for activated calpain-2 and caspase-3, cone arrestin-3, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeling. Among the compounds tested, MPT0G211, targeting predominantly cytoplasmic HDAC-6, exhibited the strongest protective effect on both rod and cone photoreceptors. Remarkably, ACY-957, inhibiting nuclear HDAC-1/-2, at higher concentration induced both photoreceptor cell death and cell proliferation. High levels of NAM, blocking mitochondrial and nuclear HDACs, caused selective rod cell death, without affecting cones. All HDAC inhibitors tested had no or only minor effects on neurons of the inner retina.

To assess whether genetic diversity influences the development of age-related autoimmunity, we studied UM-HET3 mice, a four-way cross that is commonly used in aging research. By 14-20 months of age, females showed significantly higher frequencies and endpoint titers of anti-nuclear antibodies.

Large-scale experiments on the substrates of these pathways are primarily from the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but less is known about conservation of translocation pathways. Here we take a computational approach to analyse secretion signals across the fungi. Computational predictions by the Phobius model robustly separate known SRP-dependent from Sec63-dependent proteins in S. cerevisiae. Prior work suggested that this separation is driven by the compound hydropathy of the signal peptide's hydrophobic helix, i.e., its length multiplied by maximum hydropathy. Instead, we find that the length of the hydrophobic helix is the major discriminator in native proteins: 8-13 amino acids for Sec63-dependent proteins and 16-27 amino acids for SRP-dependent proteins. Secreted proteins in diverse fungal species also separate into distinct populations by Phobius predictions and by the length of the hydrophobic helix. Our analysis across fungi shows that distinct functional groups of proteins, including fungal cell wall proteins and extracellular proteins, have cleaved signal peptides with short hydrophobic helices, similarly to Sec63-dependent proteins in S. cerevisiae.

In Drosophila embryos ~70% of mRNAs localize to specific sites in the cytoplasm, but the functional significance of this mRNA localization is largely unknown. During the process of embryo cellularization, mRNA encoding Serendipity- (Sry-), an actin filament (F-actin) binding protein, moves apically, concentrating near centrosomes. Transport is mediated by the Egl/BicD/Dynein complex and requires two stem loops in the 3'UTR of the mRNA, which serve as localization signals. mRNA localization is dispensable for Sry- function at cleavage furrows in early cellularization but is necessary for repositioning nuclei in late cellularization. Sry- protein promotes assembly of cortical F-actin and apical spot adherens junctions (AJs) in late cellularization, and these AJs contribute to nuclear repositioning. We suggest that mRNA localization restricts cytoskeletal functions in late cellularization to regulate nuclear repositioning in preparation for the tissue morphogenesis events that immediately follow.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

T.; Ono, C.; Taguwa, S.; Matsuura, Y.", "abstract": "Picornaviruses represent a diverse group of plus-stranded RNA viruses, many of which have been linked to severe diseases in both humans and animals. The picornaviral 3C protease is an ideal drug target for inhibiting viral propagation and mitigating pathogenesis; however, methodology to evaluate and compare the activity of phylogenetically diverse proteases remains lacking. To address this, herein, we propose a novel green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based reporter optimized to visualize the enzymatic activity of picornaviral 3C proteases in cells by using the conformational change of a GFP variant induced by the 3C protease, generating fluorescence emission linked to the enzymatic activity. The reporter system for the 3C protease can be applied to major pathogenic human picornaviruses, such as those in the genera Enterovirus, Rhinovirus, Cosavirus, Salivirus, and Kobuvirus. Furthermore, the fluorescent signal from the reporter was confirmed in various animal-derived picornaviruses. Therefore, the reporter could be widely used to analyze the activity of several 3C proteases from currently prevalent picornaviruses and those that may emerge in the future. To demonstrate the flexibility of the reporter in comparing phylogenetically different proteases, the enzymatic activity of the 3C protease derived from clinical strains of enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) was tested and compared. The clinical EV-A71 strains had different effects on the activity of 3C protease against host proteins. Our findings will aid in elucidating the molecular characteristics of 3C proteases among picornaviruses and developing therapeutics to mitigate the pathogenesis of these viruses.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

However, the direct substrates of Hrr25 involved in this mechanism remain poorly defined. In this study, we used a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) approach to screen for and identify physical interactors of Hrr25. The HRR25 gene was cloned into a Y2H bait vector, and its functional expression was confirmed by complementation of a temperature-sensitive hrr25-ts mutant. Screening independent Y2H libraries in three reading frames, followed by validation via reporter assays, restriction analysis, and sequencing, we identified six putative interactors: HED1, DAD1, YDR015C (from clone C1-5), REP1 (C2-15), and CYR1 and SYS1 (C3-7). Phosphorylation site prediction and AlphaFold 3.0 structural modeling identified high-confidence Hrr25 target residues, including S70/T73 on Hed1 and S63 on Dad1, S323 on Rep1, and S198/S527 on Cyr1, each located in structurally accessible and potentially functional regions. Plasmid-dependent assays confirmed that reporter activation in C1-5 depended on the presence of the prey plasmid, and restriction mapping demonstrated that C1-5 contained a full-length DAD1 ORF. Given Dad1 known role in DASH/Dam1 kinetochore complex and its function in kinetochore-microtubule attachment, along with previous findings that DAD1 mutations cause meiosis I defects, our data suggest that Dad1 may be a substrate of Hrr25. We propose that Hrr25-mediated phosphorylation of Dad1 could facilitate sister kinetochore co-orientation during meiosis I. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of chromosome segregation and identify Dad1 as a potential candidate substrate for Hrr25 in meiotic regulation.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

TF-specific loss of transporters or vesicle trafficking genes showed that terminal filament cells import molecules, transfer them through the cellular stack, and deposit near the GSC niche, a process required for ongoing oocyte production and to generate germ cell lipid droplets and fusomes. Loss of organic anion transporter Oatp30B in the TF blocked the development of GSC daughters (cystoblasts), implicating the TF in importing molecules needed for cyst and oocyte development, possibly including an endogenous ouabain.

In plants, most characterized EVEs belong to the family Caulimoviridae, the only family of retrotranscribed plant viruses, and are termed endogenous caulimovirids (ECVs). Previous studies of ECVs have proposed either cospeciation or host-switching as the primary mode of Caulimoviridae transmission through plant divisions, both scenarios assuming an emergence predating the euphyllophytes. However, robust assessments of ECV diversity and hosts were hindered by the underrepresentation of basal plant genome assemblies. Taking advantage of newly available genomic resources, we analyzed a dataset of 93 plant genome sequences representing all subdivisions of embryophytes, including basal groups such as ferns and lycophytes. We identified 47,135 ECVs in 75 genomes from lycophytes, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. Based on their diversity, these ECVs were classified into 71 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 35 of which were previously undescribed. Our work revealed an unexpected diversity of Caulimoviridae in tracheophytes and identified a new clade restricted to gymnosperms.

Various approaches exist to link DNAm variation to phenotypes, ranging from single nucleotide resolution to the development of composite indexes. We here discuss the conceptual differences between these approaches through a case study using whole genome, longitudinal DNAm data from adult zebra finches raised in experimentally created small or large broods. Specifically, we (i) identified CpG sites where DNAm was affected by brood size, and (ii) developed two DNAm-based indexes of the early-life environment (DMSi: based on differentially methylated sites with respect to rearing brood size; SMLmi: supervised machine learning-derived index optimized to predict brood size). We also compared results obtained by either merging or analyzing longitudinal DNAm samples separately and discussed how the permanence or transience of DNAm changes shapes responses to environmental variation through life. Our findings confirm that early-life environment leaves lasting DNAm signatures detectible in adulthood, and this effect is stronger later in life. Importantly, both indexes predicted early-life growth rates, demonstrating that DNAm-based indexes can be leveraged to retroactively quantify aspects of early-life conditions, providing a powerful novel tool in the study of wild populations.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Most lifeforms exhibit the phenomenon of codon usage bias, where the usage of certain codons is favored over others and hence used more often throughout the genome. Codon bias is thought to provide a layer of post-transcriptional regulation that shapes mRNA stability, translation kinetics and co-translational protein folding. Despite extensive characterization of codon bias in bacteria, viruses and various model organisms, its prevalence and functional consequences remain understudied in humans. Accordingly, this study seeks to (1) characterize the genome-wide distribution of key codon bias metrics in humans, (2) investigate how codon usage correlates with protein structural features, and (3) assess whether genes with exceptionally restricted codon repertoires are selectively constrained against synonymous mutations. Our study finds that codon usage bias is pronounced in structured protein domains relative to intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) (Cliffs = 0.26; p < 2.2); that the most frequently used codons are supported by higher tRNA gene copy numbers (p < 0.05); and that genes exhibiting extreme codon bias (high ENC) harbor significantly fewer synonymous variants than expected (r = 0.28, p < 2.2). Collectively, our findings position codon usage bias as a central, evolutionarily conserved regulator of translational efficiency, protein folding, and genomic integrity in humans.

C.; Engert, F.", "abstract": "Complex collective behaviors such as schooling are believed to emerge from simple, individual-level computations that translate incoming information from conspecifics into actions. Recently, it has been proposed that discrete behavioral modes, or internal states, may modulate these computations, affecting the resulting collective behaviors. Direct evidence for such hierarchical control remains limited due to challenges in inferring hidden perception-action computations and uncovering discrete behavioral modes from continuous behaviors. To address this, we analyzed swimming behaviors of Medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) throughout development. At the group level, Medaka exhibit synchronized swimming formations that develop early, emerging around two weeks of age and stabilizing within one month. Unlike many teleost species that use burst-and-coast swim patterns, Medaka exhibit continuous tail and body undulations. We show that this continuous behavior can be segmented into three distinct kinematic states: acceleration, deceleration, and prolonged constant speed swimming. Using state-dependent computational models, we tested how Medaka translate social information from neighbors into actions across these kinematic states. The models revealed distinct computations governing social information processing and decision making in each state. Moreover, social responsiveness varied significantly between states--it was strongest during constant-speed epochs, intermediate during accelerations, and lowest during decelerations. Compared to similarly-sized zebrafish that employ burst-and-coast kinematics, Medaka exhibited greater diversity in state-dependent social interaction computations, ultimately resulting in stronger coordinated swimming. These findings highlight discrete behavioral modes as key modulators of social interaction computations underlying collective behavior.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we focus on the native protein-protein interaction (PPI) of C-RAF, a key component of the MAPK signaling pathway, with the scaf- folding protein 14-3-3. Although extensive drug discovery efforts have focused on the MAPK pathway, its central role in oncology and developmental disorders (RASopathies), still requires alternative approaches, moving beyond direct kinase inhibition. Indeed, stabilization of native PPIs is a relatively unexplored territory in this pathway. The function of C-RAF is regulated on multiple levels including dimerization, phosphorylation and complex formation with the hub protein 14-3-3. 14-3-3 prevents C RAF activation by molecular recognition and binding at the phospho-serine 259. We used a fragment-merging approach to design a molecular glue scaffold that would bind to the composite surface of the 14-3-3/C-RAF autoinhibited complex. The synthesized molecular glues stabilized the 14-3-3/C-RAF complex up to 300-fold in biophysical assays; their glue-based mechanism of action was confirmed with several crystal structures of ternary complexes. Selectivity among the other RAF isoforms and other RAF phosphorylation sites was evaluated with biophysical assays. The best compounds showed excellent selectivity among a broad panel of 80 14-3-3 clients. Valida- tion in cell assays showed on-target engagement, enhanced phosphorylation levels of the C-RAF pS259 site, reduced RAF dimerization and reduced ERK phosphorylation. Overall, this approach enables chemical biology studies on a C-RAF site that is intrinsically disordered prior to 14-3-3 binding and has not been targeted previously. These molecular glues will be useful as chemical probes and starting points for further drug discovery efforts to elucidate the effect of native PPI stabilization in the MAPK pathway with applications in oncology and RASopathies.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Alterations in TECs contribute to abnormal angiogenesis, resulting in disorganized, leaky blood vessels that can hinder drug delivery and immune access.

This suppression is dynamically modulated during movement, as shown during upper-limb actions, yet little is known about its implication during complex lower-limb movements. We investigated tactile sensitivity during naturalistic kicking by delivering vibrotactile probe stimuli to the balancing and kicking feet at different movement phases. In Experiment 1, participants kicked a suspended ball while tactile sensitivity was probed at movement onset, mid-swing, ball con-tact, and after-contact. Results revealed distinct modulation patterns in each foot. When transitioning from bipedal to unipedal stance, tactile processing at the balancing foot was particularly suppressed but at the kicking foot it improved, suggesting concurrent modulation across the two legs depending on their motor function. Tactile sensitivity remained rather invariant at other time points, but was strongly suppressed on the kicking foot at the moment of ball contact. The strength of this suppression correlated with kicking speed, which could reflect either stronger predictive control or stronger peripheral processes that mask the vibrotactile probe. To test these, a new set of participants held their foot still while a ball collided with it at high or low speed. Suppression was greater with faster ball contacts, revealing that peripheral processes can modulate tactile processing. These findings show that lower-limb tactile sensitivity during goal-directed leg movements can be concurrently modulated across the legs, presumably reflecting an interplay between central sensorimotor processes guiding the movement and peripheral processes affecting sensitivity.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Chronic perturbation of neuronal activity triggers a compensatory modulation of the number of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors at the excitatory synapses. Previous research has primarily focused on AMPA receptors, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating the trafficking of NMDA receptors during homeostatic synaptic scaling remain unclear. Here we identify the microtubule-associated protein Tau as an essential molecule that mediates the synaptic upscaling of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors during prolonged synaptic inactivity. Chronic activity blockade increases Tau phosphorylation at Ser-235 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), enhancing its interaction with and retention of active Fyn tyrosine kinase in the postsynaptic compartment. This promotes the phosphorylation of GluN2B at Tyr-1472, subsequently stabilising the expression of NMDA receptors on the neuronal plasma membrane. Finally, we showed that Tau pathology and disease-associated mutations in Tau and the GluN2B carboxyl-terminal tail disrupt the homeostatic synaptic upscaling of NMDA receptors following chronic neuronal silencing. Together, our findings identify a physiological role for Tau in homeostatic synaptic plasticity, the perturbation of which can lead to neuronal hyperexcitation, seizures and excitotoxic cell death.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Whether the lack of NLGN2 also impacts wake/sleep states in females remains to be established. We aimed to compare sexes for the effects of NLGN2 absence on the wake/sleep architecture, spectral and multifractal ECoG activities. Nlgn2 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates were implanted with ECoG electrodes, and ECoG signals were recorded for 48 hours. Nlgn2 KO mice of both sexes spent more time awake and less time in slow wave and paradoxical sleep, with KO males spending less time in paradoxical sleep during both the light and dark periods compared to wild-type males (difference only during the dark in females). Nlgn2 KO animals displayed longer wakefulness and shorter slow wave and paradoxical sleep episodes, and KO males (but not females) showed more wake and slow wave sleep episodes during the light period. Also, mutant animals (both sexes) showed widespread differences in wake/sleep spectral activity when compared to wild-type mice, notably a slower theta peak frequency during paradoxical sleep. The most prominent Hurst exponent was significantly increased in Nlgn2 KO animals during all states, and Hurst exponents were less dispersed during paradoxical sleep only in KO females.

Surprisingly, we find that significant depletion of fibroblast density does not affect epidermal stem cell proliferative capacity during adult stages in vivo. We next probed earlier neonatal stages when skin is actively remodeling but found no change in epidermal stem cell proliferative capacity following fibroblast depletion. These results demonstrate that across different ages, epidermal stem cell proliferative capacity can persist in the face of a largely reduced fibroblast population. Interestingly, neonatal fibroblast depletion does not significantly reduce their secreted collagen I density but affects basement membrane mechanics and epidermal stem cell delamination. Despite these changes to basement membrane mechanics and delamination, the skin continues to maintain its protective barrier function. Thus, our work demonstrates the skin regenerative program employs robust compensatory mechanisms in the face of fibroblast depletion to maintain functional capacity.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

M.; Chenoweth, D. M.; Zhang, H.", "abstract": "The mitotic checkpoint protein MAD1 is significantly overexpressed in several cancers, weakening the checkpoint and promoting mitotic slippage. Overexpressed MAD1 forms ectopic foci in mitotic cells, yet the biophysical nature of these foci and their contributions to mitotic slippage remain unclear. Here, we report that MAD1 foci are phase-separated condensates that shorten the mitotic duration by sequestering checkpoint proteins. Our biophysical quantifications reveal that MAD1 ectopic foci in mitotic cells exhibit dynamic condensate properties rather than those of a solid aggregate. Using an inducible phase separation assay in live cells, we show that MAD1 phase separation is driven by interactions between its coiled-coil and disordered domains at the N-terminus. We decouple the contributions of condensation from concentration by inducing the formation of MAD1 ectopic condensates in mitotic cells with low levels of MAD1, demonstrating that the condensation process directly drives mitotic slippage. Mechanistically, the MAD1 ectopic condensate traps the diffusive pool of MAD2, an interaction partner of MAD1, thereby weakening the MAD2 conversion cycle necessary for a robust mitotic checkpoint. Our work illustrates a loss of function caused by ectopic condensates in MAD1-overexpressed cancer cells.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

A major challenge for researchers is the ability to quantify and classify complex cell and tissue spot patterns across wild type and perturbed conditions.

A well-known and easily observable distinguishing feature of spot patterns is density. Beyond this, it is unclear how to quantitatively distinguish between patterns in a reproducible way. Our work evaluates the utility of the spatial clustering of spot patterns in quantifying their organization. We propose four clustering features, obtained using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. Together with pattern density we assess how these features can quantify and distinguish between bristle patterns in a variety of wild-type and mutant flies to confirm known perturbations and discover new ones. Our results show that a combination of spot pattern density and the variance between the size of clusters is sufficient to distinguish between 70% of patterns from wild-type and mutant tissues.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

We then leverage a mammalian intestinal organoid model to confirm nearly identical basal cell-contact dynamics as those predicted in silico. Pharmacological inhibition of mitotic progression reveals that two events - basal diminution of the cell body and daughter cell reinsertion - independently drive distinct contact rearrangements.

We show how the evolution of a unique ecotype in the CCV is partially due to an allele derived from the more widespread early-migrating haplotype.

Here, we examined the vocal expression of negative emotional arousal in sheep using both stress-related behaviours to quantify bodily activation and eye temperature measured via infrared thermography, as non-invasive indicators of arousal. To this aim, twenty lambs underwent a short-term isolation test with two phases, aimed at eliciting different levels of arousal in response to separation from conspecifics: partial isolation, where lambs maintained visual, acoustic and tactile contact with conspecifics through a fence, and full isolation, with complete separation. During full isolation, lambs exhibited increased bodily activation (spending more time running, jumping, and changing state behaviours) and produced more open-mouthed bleats (321 vs 27) than in partial isolation, validating higher arousal. Eye temperature also increased from partial to full isolation (however only in small lambs compared to large ones). Calls emitted in full isolation were characterised by higher frequencies, noisiness (higher chaos) and lower durations. When combining behavioural and physiological assessment of arousal and test they impact on spectrotemporal structure of vocalizations, we found that bodily activation, but not eye peak temperature, impacted the frequency distribution and noisiness of the calls. Call duration increased with eye temperature, but only in lambs exhibiting a bodily activation high enough and the mean of the second formant increased with eye temperature in smaller, but not in larger, lambs. Hence, lamb vocalizations indicate arousal and are correlated with bodily activation, while co-variations with physio-logical measures depended on behaviour and individual traits.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In non-human animals, escape strategies are shaped by neural, biomechanical, and ecological constraints, resulting in species-specific patterns. In humans, ethical and practical constraints have, until recently, hindered investigation of escape movements. To fill this gap, we used wireless virtual reality and simulated various biologically relevant threats including apex predators as well as aggressive non-predators and conspecifics. We identified a distinct motor sequence in human escape to shelter: a head turn toward the threat, followed by body rotation in the same direction until facing away from threat, and propulsion with the ipsilateral foot to run forward. Infrequent variants included turning away from threat to escape, backward movement, and misdirected flight. Backward escape occurred more often at close shelter distance and with small-to-medium sized threats. Key kinematic features such as backward movement, delayed escape initiation, and delayed acceleration reduced escape success. At close threat distances, pre-encounter adjustments such as widening the foot stance contributed to successful escape. Individuals exhibited stable, threat-specific movement preferences that were not predicted by behaviour in non-threatening circumstances. These findings establish a framework for dissecting the neural control of escape, quantifying modulatory influences, and exploring its potential disruption in clinical populations.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

E.; Chaine, A.; Shizuka, D.", "abstract": "Social groups range from highly stable to highly dynamic over extended periods. Demographic factors like individual lifespans and rates of births, deaths, immigration, and emigration in a population can strongly impact group stability and persistence over time. Highly stable long-term groups are often driven by long-lived core individuals that maintain relationships, kin-structure, or high philopatry. In opposition, fluid groups of individuals that associate repeatedly, called social communities, can persist in populations that have high turnover, lack kin structure, and exhibit high fission-fusion dynamics. However, we lack an understanding of how animal social communities persist amidst highly dynamic membership. We investigated the drivers of persistence of social communities in a winter population of migratory golden-crowned sparrows over 12 years. Sparrows frequently flock with the same individuals over the entire winter, forming social communities that are identified from discrete clusters within a social network. Long-term community membership was highly dynamic due to high annual turnover and the relatively short lifespans of individuals. However, the social fidelity of returning members and recruitment of new members between consecutive years resulted in communities that persisted for multiple years, even when there was a complete turnover of members over time. Our results indicate that groups can persist with consistent short-term membership, overlapping generations, and turnover with balanced rates of recruitment and loss. This dynamic stability of individual membership may be a universal feature of large, long-term groups found in many social systems, from animal societies with fission-fusion dynamics to networks of human collaboration.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

The extracellular matrix is a complex and dynamic meshwork of proteins that provides biochemical and mechanical signals to surrounding cells and has been shown to drive the dissemination of several cancer types to preferential distant sites. Here, using histological assessment and proteomics, we examined the composition of the extracellular matrix of paired omentum and mesentery samples from disease-free adult females. We found that the fibrillar collagen content of the mesothelial layer of the omentum was significantly higher than that of the mesentery. Using ECM-focused proteomics, we further defined the ECM composition - or matrisome - of these two tissues. We found that over 90% of the proteins detected were shared between the omentum and mesentery. Our analysis also revealed small subsets of tissue-specific ECM proteins.

Individuals with ADHD frequently experience sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness, suggesting interactions between attention and arousal systems. Research examining brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) has demonstrated that sleep-like slow waves (SW) during wakefulness are linked to inattention in neurotypical individuals, particularly following sleep deprivation, yet their role in ADHD remains unclear. This study investigated whether individuals with ADHD present with altered waking SW distribution compared to neurotypical controls and whether SW explain attentional difficulties in ADHD. Methods: Adults with (n = 32) and without ADHD (n = 31) completed a sustained attention task while EEG recorded brain activity. Mental state probes (on-task, MW, MB) were embedded within the task. Sleep-like SW reflect a slowing of cortical activity and was detected from EEG activity. Omission/commission errors, reaction time (RT), RT variability, mental state reports and subjective sleepiness were analysed. Mediation analysis examined whether SW density explained ADHD-related performance differences. Results: Individuals with ADHD exhibited more commission errors, MW and MB, and higher SW density (SW/min), particularly over parieto-temporal electrodes. Increased SW density correlated with higher omission errors, slower RTs, greater RT variability, and elevated sleepiness ratings. On-task reports were negatively correlated with SW density. Mediation analysis revealed that SW density significantly accounted for ADHD-related attentional difficulties. Conclusions: Wake SW may explain attentional difficulties in ADHD, providing a potential mechanistic link between sleep disturbances and attentional fluctuations.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Yet, between connected areas there exist some but not all pathways. How does this structure, somewhere between feedforward and fully recurrent, shape circuit function? To address this question, we designed a new recurrent neural network model in which a set of weight matrices (i.e. pathways) can be combined to generate every network structure between feedforward and fully recurrent. We term these architectures partially recurrent neural networks (pRNNs). We trained over 25,000 pRNNs on a novel set of reinforcement learning tasks, designed to mimic multisensory navigation, and compared their performance across multiple functional metrics. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, many architectures match or exceed the performance of fully recurrent networks, despite using as few as one-quarter the number of parameters; demonstrating that partial recurrence enables energy efficient, yet performant solutions. Second, each pathway's functional impact is both task and circuit dependent. For instance, feedback connections enhance robustness to noise in some, but not all contexts. Third, different pRNN architectures learn solutions with distinct input sensitivities and memory dynamics, and these computational traits help to explain their functional capabilities. Overall, our results demonstrate that partial recurrence enables robust and efficient computation - a finding that helps to explain why neural circuits are sparse and bidirectional, and how these principles could inform the design of artificial systems.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Using scRNA transcriptomic data mining, we demonstrate that immature OLs primarily express PNN assembly genes, whereas mature OLs express PNN degradation enzymes. We then demonstrate that inhibiting IL PVs during safety learning prevents safety-induced cognitive flexibility, satellite OL maturation, and PNN degradation around IL PV.

Despite the prevalence of such tuning heterogeneity, we lack a unified theory of its computational benefits. Here, we present a framework that unifies and extends previous theories, finding that receptive field heterogeneity generally increases the information encoded in population activity. The information gain depends on heterogeneity in receptive field size, shape, and on the dimensionality of the encoded quantity. For populations encoding two-dimensional quantities, such as place cells encoding allocentric spatial position, our theory predicts that both size and shape receptive field heterogeneity are necessary to induce information gain, whereas size heterogeneity alone is insufficient. We thus turned to CA1 hippocampal activity to test our theoretical predictions - in particular, to measure shape heterogeneity, which has previously received little attention. To overcome limitations of traditional methods for estimating place cell tuning, we developed a fully probabilistic approach for measuring size and shape heterogeneity, in which tuning estimates were strategically weighted by explicitly measured uncertainty arising from biased or incomplete traversals of the environment. Our method furnished evidence that hippocampal receptive fields indeed exhibit strong degrees of size and shape heterogeneity, abiding by the normative predictions of our theory.

HD is increasingly appreciated to emerge from multiple pathogenic processes, including somatic instability in mutant HTTs (mHTT) CAG repeat tract, which leads to diverse deleterious consequences. These include the alternative processing of HTT pre-mRNA to generate the HTT1a transcript that encodes the very toxic, mHTT isoform referred to as HTT1a. We set out to compare the efficacy and safety of allele-selective lowering of mHTT compared to non-allele-selective lowering using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in heterozygous HttQ111 (Q111) mice. We developed a mutant specific ASO (MutASO) targeting Htt intron-1 that selectively reduced mutant full-length HTT, as well as HTT1a, in the brains of Q111 mice. Compared to the rescue provided by a pan-allele-targeting ASO (PanASO) that lowers wild-type HTT and full-length mHTT (sparing HTT1a), the MutASO essentially eliminated aggregate formation, and provided marked protection from transcriptional dysregulation in HD knock-in mice. Thus, by targeting the ASO to the region upstream of the cryptic polyadenylation sites required to generate the HTT1a transcript, our allele-selective MutASO potently reduced HTT1a protein levels.

These maternal factors exert their influence through maternal effects, a phenomenon where an offspring's phenotype is determined, at least in part, by the mother's environment and genotype. While environmental maternal effects can cause phenotypes that present both early and later in life, genetic maternal effects generally induce phenotypes in the earliest embryonic stages. Here, we reveal a genetic maternal effect that influences the development of cells that arise after early embryogenesis, highlighting that specific cell types can be susceptible to late-onset genetic maternal effects. Using zebrafish to study microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, we identified a mutation in sry-related HMG box gene-17 (sox17) that exhibits a maternal effect phenotype that presents as a reduction of microglia in the brain and precursors in the yolk sac. We demonstrate that sox17 is expressed in microglia and their yolk sac precursors and is maternally-loaded. We show that sox17 restoration via embryonic injection reverses the maternal effect on microglia and yolk sac cells in sox17 mutants. To identify additional genes interacting with sox17, we nominated genes from scRNA sequencing analysis of mouse embryonic microglia to perform a genetic screen using CRISPR mutagenesis and a custom-built robot that captures confocal images of the zebrafish brain in high-throughput. This screen identified f11r.1, gas6, and mpp1 as modifiers of microglia abundance in the embryonic brain, which we demonstrated are also expressed in zebrafish microglia. Transcriptional and mutant analyses with these new modifiers suggest that sox17 positively regulates mpp1 transcription.

A significant barrier in this field is that existing techniques for monitoring feeding are either prohibitively expensive, limiting their use, or lack the high temporal resolution necessary to align feeding events with neuronal activity. To overcome these limitations and democratize this technology, we developed the Crunchometer, an open-source sound-based system that utilizes a cost-effective condenser microphone and video recordings, along with two mathematical methods (supervised thresholding and an unsupervised Support Vector Machine, SVM), to precisely capture bite sounds with unprecedented temporal resolution and built a feeding ethogram for both Chow and High-Fat Diet (HFD) pellets. While human observers tend to estimate longer, more frequent feeding bouts, our automated methods more precisely and reliably detect the start and end times of most feeding bouts. In consequence, both automated methods fragmented feeding bouts more frequently than human observers. We demonstrate the Crunchometer's utility by monitoring feeding patterns across different energy states, hunger (fasted), and satiety, and by characterizing the pharmacological effects of the anti-obesity drug semaglutide. This revealed that semaglutide not only suppresses solid food intake but also decreases the preference for HFD pellets. Additionally, we differentiate the genetically-evoked gnawing from consummatory feeding behaviors involving GABAergic neurons in the Lateral Hypothalamus (LH). Importantly, the Crunchometer integrates seamlessly with in vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging in freely behaving mice. The Crunchometer, paired with recordings of LH activity, revealed the presence of meal-related neurons that monitor the entire meal, rather than just individual feeding bouts. Microendoscopes and calcium imaging on Vgat-IRES-cre and Vglut2-IRES-cre mice further suggest that GABA neurons in LH (but not glutamatergic neurons) are also strongly modulated by eating a solid food pellet. Notably, the acts of licking liquid sucrose and eating solid food activate distinct sets of neurons. Its compatibility with electrophysiology and calcium imaging makes the Crunchometer an ideal tool for elucidating the neuronal correlates of feeding behavior for solid foods.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

The establishment of direction-selective signals, a hallmark of motion detection, is considered a core neural computation and has been characterized extensively in primates, mice and fruit flies. In flies, the circuits that produce direction-selective signals rely on feedforward visual pathways that connect peripheral visual inputs to the dendrites of the ON and OFF-direction selective cells. Here we describe a novel role for feedback inhibition in motion computation. Two GABAergic neurons, C2 and C3, connect to neurons upstream of the direction-selective T4 and T5 cells and blocking C2 and C3 affects direction selectivity in T4/T5. In the ON pathway, this is likely achieved by C2-mediated suppression of responses in the major T4 input neuron Mi1. Together, C2 and C3 suppress responses to non-preferred stimuli in both T4 and T5. At the behavioral level, feedback inhibition temporally sharpens responses to ON stimuli, enhancing the flys ability to discriminate visual stimuli that occur in quick succession. GABAergic inhibitory feedback neurons thus constitute an essential component within the circuitry that computes visual motion.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that the chromatin remodeler SMARCA5 establishes epigenetic priming that is required for retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation in the male germline. Germ cell-specific deletion of Smarca5 results in a complete loss of differentiating spermatogonia, phenocopying vitamin A-deficient mice that lack RA signaling. During the perinatal transition from prospermatogonia to undifferentiated spermatogonia, SMARCA5 is recruited to binding sites of the pioneer transcription factor DMRT1, which are located at distal putative enhancers and promoters of germline genes. The SMARCA5-DMRT1 pioneer complex establishes chromatin accessibility at these loci, generating poised enhancers and promoters that serve as RA receptor (RAR)-binding sites. Thus, SMARCA5 licenses transcriptional responses to RA that enable spermatogenic differentiation.

R.; Friedlander, G.; Kalcheim, C.", "abstract": "The development of dI1 spinal interneurons is orchestrated by an interplay of transcriptional and signaling programs whose dynamics remains to be elucidated. By single-cell RNA sequencing of the E4 quail neural tube under both normal and retinoic acid (RA) activity-deprived conditions, we provide a high-resolution atlas delineating a continuous developmental trajectory from proliferative progenitors to differentiated neurons, each marked by distinct gene expression profiles and spatial positioning. Early stages are dominated by proliferation and cell cycle regulators, while differentiation involves waves of genes controlling cytoskeletal remodeling and migration. Signaling pathways, including BMP and RA, exhibit stage-specific activity: BMP signaling is prominent in early progenitors and antagonized as differentiation proceeds, with RA modulating both BMP and Wnt pathways in a context-dependent manner. RA exerts dual roles, promoting cell cycle progression in progenitors but restraining differentiation at later stages, and is essential for proper dI1 interneuron migration and localization. Loss of RA signaling disrupts ventral migration, leading to aberrant positioning and increased cell numbers, linked to altered expression of genes governing cell adhesion, cytoskeletal dynamics, and axon guidance. These findings illuminate the multifaceted, stage-dependent functions of RA in coordinating the specification, differentiation, and migration of dI1 interneurons, advancing our understanding of neural circuit formation in the developing spinal cord.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

The clade is diverse in retinal phenotypes, with many sharks and rays possessing rods and multiple cone types. In contrast, the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) has only a single type of rod photoreceptor, which is reported to have taken on some physiological and anatomical properties of cones. How does the little skate develop this photoreceptor system? To investigate this question, we identified an early stage of embryonic photoreceptor formation based on Otx2 expression. To assess whether cone photoreceptor gene regulatory networks regulated by the Onecut1 transcription factor were intact we developed an electroporation approach. Activation of a Onecut1dependent reporter was not detected supporting a change in early Onecut1 transcriptional networks associated with cone photoreceptor formation. To assess developmental changes in gene expression, bulk RNA-Seq samples of embryos, juvenile hatchlings and adult retinas were generated. As expected, gene expression changes associated with cone photoreceptors of other species were not identified in the little skate and several cone-enriched genes were found to be pseudogenes. A splice isoform of Onecut1 with an additional 48 amino acid sequence located between the CUT and Homeodomain DNA-binding domains, referred to as spacer isoform or LSOC1X2, was identified and exhibited high expression in the embryo compared to juvenile and adult stages. To test if this LSOC1X2 isoform retained its regulatory potential compared to the isoform without the additional sequence, we tested it in a mouse retina reporter assay. Both skate Onecut1 isoforms were able to activate the Onecut1-dependent transcriptional reporter. Thus, the spacer isoform represents a developmentally regulated, novel retinal Onecut1 isoform with regulatory potential. This identifies it as a target for further analysis in the retinal development of the little skate and its elasmobranch relatives.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In non-equilibrium systems, an equally profound question arises: to what extent does noise alter the transition paths between valleys in such dynamic landscapes. We tackle this question using a set of illustrative exemplars, and show that noise gives rise to paths that differ substantially from the canonical least-action paths calculated under deterministic dynamics. We dissect the dynamics of these exemplars and determine the reactive density and transition currents, which show us, respectively, where and how transitions occur for different realisations of stochastic dynamics.

Our research uses metabarcoding to assess the diet detected in fecal samples from long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) on the islands of Singapore and Bali, Indonesia. We gathered information about multiple parameters to characterize the distinctly different anthropogenic environments on the two islands. Then, we used a leave one out cross validation model selection procedure and linear regressions to determine which environmental parameters impact various diet metrics for the macaques in these two different anthropogenic contexts. Macaques in both island contexts increased their usage of crop diet items with greater anthropogenic access, but with different resulting patterns. We found that as food provisioning of the macaques increases in Bali, multiple measures of diet richness decrease, as generally expected, yet diet stability within a group also decreases, indicating that although diet richness decreases with provisioning, individuals do not experience similar levels of access to these resources. In contrast to Bali, there were no significant differences in diet stability across groups in Singapore with increases in anthropogenic resources. These differing impacts on diet, seen in a single species, highlight the need to consider more closely the details of the spatial and temporal distribution of anthropogenic resource access when making predictions about how a species' diet will be impacted.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Because of its complex pathogenic mechanisms, however, effective interventions applicable to multiple retinal degenerations remain limited. Excessive microglia-mediated inflammation is a common pathological feature of different retinal degenerative diseases, and inhibiting these overactive inflammatory responses by reprogramming microglia may provide a therapeutic strategy with broad-spectrum potential. Here, we uncover a novel retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) homeostatic signal, PD-L1, that drives the reprogramming of activated microglial toward a retinal-protective phenotype. Using multiple analyses, including gene expression profiling bioinformatics, adeno-associated virus-mediated RPE-specific gene overexpression, pharmacological, and genetic manipulations, we show that RPE cells upregulate the expression of PD-L1 to modulate microglia for protection against retinal degeneration in an experimental dry AMD mouse model. Bioinformatics enrichment analysis of the high-expression gene signatures of subretinal microglia in AMD patients, combined with pharmacological blocking of NF-{kappa}B activity or using Nlrp3 knockout mice, show that PD-L1/PD-1 signaling suppresses NF-{kappa}B activation in microglia, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome priming and attenuating microglia-mediated excessive inflammation. Furthermore, the overexpression of PD-L1 by the AAV8 virus exerts similar microglial reprogramming and retinal protective effects to alleviate retinal degeneration in a preclinical model of retinitis pigmentosa. These findings reveal that RPE-derived PD-L1 suppresses inflammatory reprogramming of subretinal microglia and mitigates retinal degeneration, highlighting a promising proof of concept for PD-L1 as a potential therapeutic target for the broad treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

We developed a theoretical framework for studying this problem using a computational successor features model. Model simulations demonstrate how spurious observations arise in such contexts to compound noise in memory and limit the generalizability of learning. We then provide behavioral evidence in human participants for a semantic inductive bias that constrains these predictive learning dynamics based on the semantic relatedness of causes and outcomes.

In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) often achieve higher predictive accuracy, but lack the interpretability afforded by classical RL models. We combined the strengths of both approaches using HybridRNNs, neural-cognitive models that integrate interpretable RL mechanisms with flexible recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We created a series of HybridRNNs to test previous assumptions about reversal learning mechanisms in an open human reversal learning dataset. Our results show that a HybridRNN incorporating choice perseverance and taking into account the reward history of alternative choices when evaluating new rewards (Context-ANN) outperformed classical RL models while maintaining interpretability. Context-ANN successfully replicated human behavioral patterns during reversal trials, suggesting that humans employ flexible, context-dependent value updating in reversal learning tasks.

Here, we examined how acute stress, simulated via vigorous shaking resembling a predatory attack, affects bumblebees' sensitivity thresholds for resolution and contrast sensitivity, two basic visual features, as well as their choice behaviour and decision speed in a dual-choice discrimination task. We found that, similar to humans, stress modulated both thresholds. It increased contrast sensitivity thresholds and shifted spatial frequency thresholds toward finer resolution as well as affecting bee final choice behaviour. Not only were stressed bees more likely to commit to a choice, but they did so significantly faster when their early perceptual decisions were accurate.

This phenomenon is known as learning to learn in cognitive science and meta-learning in artificial intelligence. While this phenomenon is well-established in humans and animals, no quantitative framework exists for characterizing the trajectories through which biological agents adapt their learning strategies. Previous computational studies that either assume fixed strategies or use task-optimized neural networks do not explain how humans refine strategies through experience. Here we show that humans adjust their reinforcement learning strategies resembling principles of gradient-based online optimization. We introduce DynamicRL, a framework using neural networks to track how participants' learning parameters (e.g., learning rates and decision temperatures) evolve throughout experiments. Across four diverse bandit tasks, DynamicRL consistently outperforms traditional reinforcement learning models with fixed parameters, demonstrating that humans continuously adapt their strategies over time. These dynamically-estimated parameters reveal trajectories that systematically increase expected rewards, with updates significantly aligned with policy gradient ascent directions. Furthermore, this learning process operates across multiple timescales, with strategy parameters updating more slowly than behavioral choices, and update effectiveness correlates with local gradient strength in the reward landscape.

P.; Escabi, M. A.; Stevenson, I.

Previous statistical techniques have shown how time-averaged spike-spike correlations can be predicted by the time-averaged relationships between the individual neurons and the local field potential (LFP). However, spiking and LFP are both nonstationary, and spike-spike correlations have nonstationary structure that cannot be accounted for by time-averaged approaches. Here we develop parametric models that predict spike-spike correlations using a small number of LFP-based predictors, and we then apply these models to the problem of tracking changes in spike-spike correlations over time. Parametric models allow for flexibility in the choice of which LFP recording channels and frequency bands to use for prediction, and coefficients directly indicate which LFP features drive correlated spiking. Here we demonstrate our methods in simulation and test the models on experimental data from large-scale multi-electrode recordings in the mouse hippocampus and visual cortex. In single time windows, we find that our parametric models can be as accurate as previous nonparametric approaches, while also being flexible and interpretable. We then demonstrate how parametric models can be applied to describe nonstationary spike-spike correlations measured in sequential time windows. We find that although the patterns of both cortical and hippocampal spike-spike correlations vary over time, these changes are, at least partially, predicted by models that assume a fixed spike-field relationship. This approach may thus help to better understand how the dynamics of spike-spike correlations are related to functional brain states.

Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and methylation arrays across multiple disease stages, we identified widespread DNAm alterations associated with genotype and neuropathological burden.

A brief period of sleep loss impairs memory, particularly hippocampus-dependent memories, and alters molecular signaling and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Studies have shown that sleep deprivation (SLD) alters neuronal activation as indicated by broad changes in gene expression signatures and by the altered expression of c-Fos, an immediate early gene (IEG) that functions as a molecular marker of neuronal activity. In the present study, we examined hippocampal subregion-specific c-Fos induction patterns. We find that CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibit the most robust c-Fos induction after SLD. Within CA1, the proximal region, where spatial information is processed and encoded, shows higher c-Fos levels after SLD as compared to the distal region. Using an activity-driven ribosomal tagging system and a repeated SLD model, we identify a specific population of excitatory neurons in area CA1 that are reactivated by repeated SLD. This approach also enables analysis of individual gene expression from c-Fos+ neurons to identify specific molecular signatures of neurons sensitive to repeated sleep loss. In summary, our study provides a detailed view of the activation of hippocampal neurons after SLD, revealing a subset of CA1 pyramidal neurons having higher sensitivity to the effect of sleep loss and laying the groundwork for further research investigating molecular changes in neurons specifically impacted by repeated sleep loss.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Phase one of the study found that EM1 and EM2 activation protected A{beta}42-treated cells. This protection, mediated by -opioid receptor (MOR) activation, also reduced rotenone-induced oxidative stress, both in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with naloxone, a -opioid antagonist, reversed these effects, confirming MOR involvement in EM1 and EM2's actions. In phase two, molecular docking techniques suggested that sitagliptin can prevent intracellular EM1 degradation. In vitro assays demonstrated that sitagliptin enhanced intracellular EM1's beneficial effects in promoting cell survival and reducing cell apoptotic activity, A{beta}42 aggregation, and hydrogen peroxide free radical concentrations. This suggests intracellular EM1 can mitigate the toxic effects of A{beta}42 aggregation.

Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may modulate neurodegeneration; however, its role as a mediator in the APOE-A{beta} relationship remains unclear. Objective: To evaluate whether specific microbial taxa mediate APOE-related effects on brain A{beta} burden in an established population-based study of middle-aged adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the Framingham Heart Study cohort. Data were collected at the third examination visit (n = 227, %Female = 58, mean age = 56.5 {+/-} 8.3), between 2016 and 2019. Exposures: Gut bacterial DNA was sequenced using 16S rRNA, and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were agglomerated at various taxonomic levels (14 phyla, 70 families, and ~140 genera). APOE genotypes were derived from blood DNA using PCR and restriction isotyping. Predicted microbial functional potential was based on KEGG Orthologs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall and regional measures of cerebral amyloid-{beta} deposition were assessed using carbon-11 Pittsburgh (PiB) Compound-B PET scans. The global PiB deposition served as the primary outcome for overall amyloid burden. Regional amyloid deposition values were analyzed as secondary outcomes. Results: A higher A{beta} burden was significantly associated with the depletion of protective genera (e.g., Faecalibacterium {beta} [95%CI], -0.35 [-0.40, -0.30]; Ruminococcus -0.25 [-0.27, -0.23]; Butyricicoccus -0.27 [-0.32, -0.22]) and the enrichment of pro-inflammatory taxa (e.g., Alistipes 0.07 [0.06, 0.08], Bacteroides 0.10 [0.07, 0.13]) and Barnesiella (0.18 [0.16, 0.20]). These associations were more pronounced in APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers, who exhibited a broader spectrum of microbial dysbiosis. Mediation analysis showed that Ruminococcus, Butyricicoccus, Clostridium, and Christensenellaceae collectively mediated ~0.3-0.4% of the effect of APOE {varepsilon}4 on global A{beta} burden. Functional profiling revealed a reduced abundance of microbial genes involved in key metabolic pathways among individuals with higher A{beta} levels. Conclusion and Relevance: Gut microbiome composition partially mediates the relationship between APOE {varepsilon}4 and cerebral amyloid burden. These findings support a gut-brain axis mechanism in AD and suggest that microbiome-targeted interventions may mitigate APOE-related risk.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

We apply this method to visualise the inputs driving hippocampal place cell activity. Our method provides a compact and intuitive description of the various dendritic events underlying subthreshold activity, spiking, or burst firing. By contrasting the dendritic input currents preceding spiking and bursting, we demonstrate that both could occur at highly variable input levels to proximal dendrites (basal and oblique), and that strong distal inputs facilitates, rather than controls, the generation of complex spike bursts.

Functional MRI studies have reported the effects of psilocybin on brain activity and connectivity; however, these measurements rely on neurovascular coupling to infer neural activity changes and assume that blood flow responses to neural activity are not altered by psilocybin. Using two-photon excited fluorescence imaging in the visual cortex of awake mice to simultaneously measure neural activity and capillary blood flow dynamics, we found that psilocybin administration prolonged the increase in visual stimulus-evoked capillary blood flow - an effect which was reduced by pretreatment with a 5 HT2AR antagonist - despite not causing changes in the stimulus-evoked neural response. Multi modal widefield imaging also showed that psilocybin extends the stimulus-evoked vascular responses in surface vessels with no observed effect on the population neural response. Computational simulation with a whole-brain neural mass model showed that prolonged neurovascular coupling responses can lead to spurious increases in BOLD-based measures of functional connectivity.

KCNQ2 encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel KV7.2, which regulates action potential threshold and repolarization. However, the relationship between KV7.2 dysfunction and abnormal neuronal activity remains unclear. Here, we use human induced pluripotent stem (iPSC)-derived neurons from 5 KCNQ2-DEE patients with pathogenic variants and CRISPR/Cas9-corrected isogenic controls to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms. We identify a common dyshomeostatic enhancement of Ca2+-activated small conductance potassium (SK) channels, which drives larger post-burst afterhyperpolarizations in KCNQ2-DEE neurons. Using microelectrode arrays (MEAs), we recorded over 18 million extracellular spikes from >8,000 neurons during 5 weeks in culture and then applied supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to dissect time-dependent functional neuronal phenotypes that defined both patient-specific and shared firing features among KCNQ2-DEE patients. Our analysis identified irregular spike timing and enhanced bursting as functional biomarkers of KCNQ2-DEE and demonstrated the significant influence of genetic background on phenotypic diversity. Importantly, using unbiased machine learning models, we showed that chronic treatment with the KV7 activator retigabine rescues the disease-associated functional phenotypes with variable efficacy.

These synapses exhibit striking structural and functional diversity, arising from differences in their proteomic composition and turnover. Synaptome mapping at single-synapse resolution reveals that this diversity is spatially organised along the dendritic tree of individual neurons. However, the cell biological mechanisms underlying the generation of these spatial synaptic patterns and their variation across neuron types and throughout the lifespan remain poorly understood. To investigate the contributions of somatic and dendritic protein synthesis, protein trafficking, and local regulatory mechanisms such as activity-dependent degradation, we developed computational models simulating these processes and compared their predictions with empirical synaptome data. We found that an extended sushi-belt model for spatial trafficking and local synaptic demand for proteins was sufficient to explain the complex profiles of synaptic protein distributions observed in young, mature and old mice and in different cell types. Our findings suggest the highly complex and dynamic synaptome architecture of the brain is an emergent property of a minimal set of cell biological processes.

L.; LABRADOR, J.; VILLAR-SUAREZ, V.", "abstract": "Introduction: Neurotmesis, the most severe form of peripheral nerve injury, remains a significant clinical challenge due to limited intrinsic regenerative capacity and suboptimal outcomes of current therapies. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) secretome has emerged as a promising cell-free alternative, providing neurotrophic and immunomodulatory factors to support nerve repair while avoiding the limitations of cell transplantation. This study aimed to evaluate the regenerative efficacy of primed adipose-derived MSC secretome in a rat model of sciatic nerve neurotmesis. Materials and Methods: Human and rat adipose-derived MSCs were cultured and primed under hypoxic and inflammatory conditions. Secretomes were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, proteomics, and total protein quantification. Neurotmesis was induced in Wistar rats, followed by repair with biomaterial alone or combined with human or rat secretome. Functional recovery was assessed by neurophysiological measurements (CMAP, NAP) at 6 months. Molecular and protein analyses included qPCR for myelination genes and ELISA for NGF. Morphological regeneration was evaluated by histology, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Secretome priming enhanced the secretion of neurotrophic factors (GDNF, VEGFA, FGF2) and immunomodulatory proteins (IL6, CCL2), as confirmed by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. In vivo, secretome-treated groups showed significantly improved neurophysiological recovery, with restoration of CMAP/NAP amplitudes and increased NGF levels. qPCR revealed upregulation of myelination-associated genes (MPZ, Krox-20, c-Jun) in treated nerves. Histological and TEM analyses demonstrated robust axonal regeneration, thicker myelin sheaths, and the presence of Remak bundles. Conclusions: Primed MSC secretome markedly enhances structural and functional recovery after sciatic nerve neurotmesis, supporting its potential as a safe, effective, and scalable cell-free therapy for peripheral nerve repair.

Details of responses for each anatomical area are presented. Area TPO is a key output node from the auditory cluster with strong links to pFC. Area AuA1 is activated by the deviant, high frequency, stimulus then turns off after the standard stimuli cease. Inactivation of AuRPB causes ambiguous spikes in AuA1 and reduced responses, consistent with experimental observations. the simulations facilitate analysis of the driving forces arriving at AuA1 and suggests that feedback from AuRPB to AuA1 is carried over multiple local network pathways.

It is known that neuroinflammation is initiated by microglia, which interact with astrocytes and neurons. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying intercellular interactions during neuroinflammation are not fully understood. To elucidate these mechanisms, multicellular culture systems are required, although the availability of the culture systems using human cells is limited. In this study, we developed a tri-culture system of neurons, astrocytes, and microglia derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to evaluate their relationships in neuroinflammation. Previously, differentiation of astrocytes from iPSCs was commonly induced using serum. However, serum stimulation has been reported to cause irreversible activation of astrocytes. Therefore, we generated astrocytes using a serum-free method and established a tri-culture system. Microglia cocultured with the astrocytes and neurons exhibited a morphology with branched processes compared to the monoculture system, suggesting a homeostatic state. By applying lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation to induce inflammation, the microglial morphology shifted to an amoeboid shape, accompanied by an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B revealed that LPS specifically activates microglia through the TLR4 receptor, which subsequently releases TNF-, leading to the activation of astrocytes. Furthermore, activated astrocytes were shown to enhance neuronal excitability. Using the tri-culture system, we elucidated a part of the cascade involving microglia, astrocytes, and neurons during neuroinflammation and demonstrated the amplification of inflammatory signals through cell communication. This culture system will be valuable for conducting detailed investigations into the interactions between glia and neurons, advancing research on neurodegenerative diseases associated with neuroinflammation.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

We found that populations of anatomically segregated auditory cortex neurons project to different visual cortical areas, broadcasting distinct auditory information to the dorsal and ventral visual processing streams. While sound frequency information was homogenously distributed across visual cortical areas, sound location information was differentially broadcast across the visual cortex. Specifically, sound azimuth and elevation were differentially encoded across visual cortical areas and streams matching the retinotopic bias of the target area.

MRI data allow optimizing positioning on the skull. The chamber is implanted into a precisely matched craniotomy, improving mechanical stability. For maximal biocompatibility, chamber and headpost are made out of titanium. It consists of an outer cylinder into which adjustably screws an inner one, called ''well'', with a glass window on its bottom. This allows easy opening and closing whenever access to the cortex is needed, while preserving a sterile seal when closed. Moreover, simply rotating the well allows fine adjustment of the window's distance with respect to the underlying cortex. Together with using a curved - rather than flat - glass window, this allows achieving gentle but continuous contact with the underlying cortex, which helps to delay tissue regrowth of, notably of a neomembrane that must otherwise be surgically removed. The chamber's sealing system combines a silicone elastomer and O-ring, minimizing infection risk and CSF leakage. Data from longitudinal two-photon imaging using genetically encoded fluorescent calcium sensors reveal high optical quality over months, with excellent resolution of neurons and their activity. We also demonstrate the feasibility of two-photon imaging of genetically encoded voltage sensors in the marmoset cortex in-vivo.

Using motion capture technology, we recorded reach-to-grasp actions toward large and small objects and had participants predict target size from hand kinematics at varying time points. Our analysis revealed that prediction performance not only evolved with increasing kinematic information but, crucially, differed significantly between target size choices. To provide insight into the underlying processes, we developed a comparative framework using two distinct machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machines (SVM) modeling kinematic information and CNN-RNN networks extracting visual patterns.

Results: At the group level, both GM and UK infants showed habituation but not novelty responses, higher inter- versus intra-hemispheric connectivity, stronger inter-hemispheric connectivity in temporal regions relative to frontal regions, stronger inter-regional connectivity between right temporal and left frontal regions, and UK infants also showed non-vocal > vocal selectivity. Conclusions: Cross-cohort differences in the cross-paradigm analyses suggest context-specific developmental markers are evident within the first month of life and show high individual variability. Cross-paradigm analyses revealed that greater vocal selectivity (UK) was associated with higher inter-hemispheric connectivity, potentially allowing us to identify biomarkers of more mature neurodevelopment within the first weeks of postnatal life.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In the Drosophila larva, each muscle is co-innervated by a tonic and a phasic glutamatergic MN. Here, we show that the tonic MN1 undergoes robust heterosynaptic sprouting and forms ectopic NMJs when neighboring muscles are deprived of both their native tonic and phasic inputs. This structural plasticity is not induced by silencing, but instead requires the physical ablation of adjacent MNs. Live imaging of the same MN1 axons in individual animals reveals that sprouting initiates early and expands progressively across larval stages. In contrast, phasic MNs show minimal remodeling, indicating that tonic MNs possess a greater intrinsic capacity for neuroplasticity. Notably, as MN1 establishes new synapses on targets it does not normally innervate, it redistributes pre-synaptic territory across both native and ectopic muscles. These findings identify a subtype-specific, injury-induced rewiring program in an intact motor circuit.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

The initial stages of ICH pathogenesis are characterized by downregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated signaling factors (Adamtsl2, Htra3, and Lama4) that functionally connect to canonical TGFbeta activation and signaling in vascular endothelial cells. Conversely, the progressive resolution of ICH involves upregulation of neuroinflammatory signaling networks (Gas6 and Axl) alongside activation of iron metabolism pathway components (Hmox1, Cp, and Slc40a1) in astrocytes and microglial cells. Integrated computational modeling identifies additional ligand-receptor signaling networks between perivascular glial cells and endothelial cells during both ICH pathogenesis and resolution.

Here, we identify and characterize a subset of adult pancreas-derived cells, termed islet pancridia cells (IPCs), that can be expanded in vitro and retain the potential for endocrine differentiation and islet cell function. Single-cell RNA sequencing of expanded pancridia revealed transcriptomic profiles resembling immature beta cells, enriched with markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. A CD9, PROCR subpopulation of IPCs formed IPC clusters marked by restricted expression of RGS16, a known islet progenitor marker. In vivo, co-transplantation of expanded IPCs with a subtherapeutic dose of islets significantly improved graft function and partially restored native pancreatic endocrine activity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. In vitro, treatment of RGS16 IPC clusters with the small molecule ISX9 induced differentiation into islet organoids that co-expressed and secreted insulin and glucagon. ISX9-mediated differentiation was driven by calcineurin/NFAT-dependent recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase p300 and displacement of histone deacetylases (HDACs) at the RFX6 and NEUROD1 promoters. Pre-treatment with the HDAC inhibitor ITF2357 further enhanced islet cell differentiation by promoting chromatin remodeling and facilitating NFAT-targeted recruitment of p300. These findings uncover calcium-dependent and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the differentiation of multipotent CD9, PROCR, RGS16 IPCs into functional islet organoids and offer potential strategies for regenerating islet cell mass to treat diabetes.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

While parental age at conception can influence offspring telomere length, the magnitude and direction of this effect differ across studies, species, and parental sexes. A significant knowledge gap therefore exists in understanding how parental age influences offspring telomere length across vertebrates. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effects of paternal and maternal age at conception on offspring telomere length, incorporating 99 effect sizes from 30 human studies and 49 effect sizes from 12 non-human vertebrates. Within the human studies, there was a positive overall parental age effect on offspring telomere length, while no effect was found in the non-human vertebrate studies after adjusting for study, estimate, and phylogenetic effects. There was considerable heterogeneity in both human and non-human studies. In human studies, heterogeneity was mainly attributed to between-study variance, and in non-human studies to phylogeny. Parental age effect estimates were correlated with the laboratory methods used for measuring telomere length in all studies. In human studies, the interaction between parental sex and offspring sex, and the cell type used for telomere extraction affected the parental age effect estimates. In non-human vertebrates, the parental age effects were more positive when the parents identity was controlled for in the study. We recommend that future research be conducted on a broader range of taxa, test for within-parent effects, and follow standardized reporting practices to enhance data comparability.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Though the beneficial effects of exposure to a complex environment in animal models have been well-documented by behavioural, immunohistological and morphological observations, its impact on the functional properties of neuronal populations remains poorly understood. This study aimed to compare the functional encoding and offline memory retrieval dynamics of cortical neurons in enriched and control mice performing a virtual spatial foraging task. Thy1-GCaMP6s mice aged 21 days were enriched for 9 weeks by running a complex obstacle course, during which they were gradually exposed to many different types of obstacles requiring climbing, jumping, and/or balancing elements. Control animals were exercise-matched by running a similar track containing only repeating ramps. At the age of 3 months, two-photon calcium imaging was conducted on populations of neurons from the secondary motor cortex in both groups before, during, and after repeated locomotion through a virtual environment with salient visual-tactile cues. We observed an increase in memory reactivation in the enriched group during the first day of exposure. With training, enriched animals exhibited a stronger anticipatory reduction in running speed near the reward location. Moreover, cortical neuron activity representing locations on the track became substantially more stable and precise over days in enriched but not control animals. Altogether, these results indicate that prior environmental enrichment accelerates the consolidation of stable and task-relevant memory representations in the cortex for a novel task, and enables faster and more robust acquisition of new sequence representations.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

More recently, FSP27 has also been implicated in maintaining vascular health through its influence on endothelial signaling. Despite growing insights into FSP27s systemic functions, its involvement in the central nervous system and cognitive regulation have remained unexplored. In this study, we present the first evidence that FSP27 is a critical regulator of cognitive function. Utilizing a global FSP27 knockout (Fsp27-/-) mouse model, we demonstrate that FSP27 deficiency results in significant impairments in learning, memory retention, and spatial awareness. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, genome-wide transcriptome profiling of brain tissue from Fsp27-/- mice was performed, revealing significant (P<0.05) alterations in gene expression related to neurocognition and metabolic pathways. Notably, FSP27 deletion was associated with genomic instability (P=0.05), downregulation of genes essential for axonal transport (NES=-1.91, FDR q-value=0.21), neuronal plasticity, and brain development (NES=-1.91, FDR q-value=0.28), along with signatures of disrupted systemic metabolism and elevated stress responses (NES=1.81, FDR q-value=0.20) in the brain, the processes tightly linked to cognitive dysfunction.

Through PI, animals integrate their movements during foraging into a ''home vector'' that allows direct return to the origin. In humans, feedback from body movement contributes to readout of the home vector: physical estimation by walking toward the origin improves people's ability to identify the origin point. However, how such feedback affects home vector readout in other animals remains unclear. Here, we suggest that leg movement feedback contributes to a robust readout of the home vector against errors induced by social behavior in fiddler crabs. Depending on whether they engaged in territorial behavior before homing runs, fiddler crabs altered their response to visual cues (fake burrow entrances) placed along their homing path. When social behavior was absent, the crabs showed a clear transition in behavior, initially suppressing visual cues in favor of PI but prioritizing visual cues as they approached their burrow. But when social behavior was present, this clear transition was disrupted, suggesting that error was induced into the internal estimation of burrow locations when the crabs attempted to interact with visual cues. Nevertheless, when crabs ignored the fake burrow entrance, they returned to their masked true burrow with equal precision regardless of the presence or absence of social behavior. These results suggest that the internal estimation of burrow location during the return is subject to induced errors, whereas the physical estimation is not, and feedback from leg movement contributes to robust distance measurement.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

By further combining single molecule localization with cryo-CLEM, molecular positions of individual emitters can be revealed in the context of the electron density map of a cell, providing unique insights to profound questions in cell biology and virology. However, cryogenic fluorescence light microscopy (cryo-FLM) suffers from severe and spatially heterogeneous optical aberrations that distort the point spread function, limiting the accuracy of molecular localizations as well as downstream cryo-transmission electron microscopy workflows. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative analysis of optical aberrations in a commercial cryo-FLM system, uncovering the sources of significant distortions such as system imperfections, refractive index mismatches, and sample-induced heterogeneities. These system and sample induced aberrations lead to localization errors up to 90 nm laterally and over 300 nm axially, challenging the feasibility of precise molecular positioning within the vitrified specimen. We demonstrate that these errors are partially mitigated by spatially matched or adaptive point spread function models pushing the error rate down to ten nanometers or less, offering practical guidance for aberration-aware cryo-FLM and cryo-CLEM strategies. Our findings highlight the necessity of accurate, in situ point spread function modeling to achieve nanometer-scale localization in cryo-FLM.

Ceramide accumulation increases membrane order and drives the formation of internalizing vesicles enriched in ceramides, which traffic through the endolysosomal system. These vesicles act as carriers that transmit membrane remodeling signals to intracellular compartments, altering their biophysical properties and function. In parallel, ceramide production reprograms lipid droplet metabolism, decreasing polarity and modifying gene expression related to lipid storage.

The theoretical physicochemical results obtained were compared with other experimental results derived from the treatment of improved and recovered oil after mixing Biocompatible Pharmaceutical Formulations (BPF) of these three compounds and oil produced in Venezuela. The Spartan 16 program was used to build the molecular structures and simulate the interactions with the semi-empirical PM3 method, to compare them with two real experiments. These two experiments were performed as follows: in the first, the mixture consists of a surfactant, (Z)-Sorbitan mono-9-octadecenoate poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl) or polyoxoethylene (20) sorbitan mono-oleate (Polysorbate 80), which is mixed with the hydrocarbon, and then completely fluidized with the addition of ethyl alcohol or ethanol.Water and ions (<100 ppm) present in this experiment are contained in oil and ethanol as contaminants (approximately 1.73-1.30% of total water). In the second experiment, the BPF ratios were 10:5:0.1:0.01 for oil:water with 17,800 ppm NaCl:P-80:ethanol (approximately 33.09% of total water and 1.78% w/v NaCl). The simulations were performed taking into account both real experiments. The simulated interactive products were characterized by the following parameters: energy, minimum conformational energy, solvation energy, aqueous energy, HOMO energy, LUMO energy, {Delta}E, dipole moment, polarizability, electrostatic potential map (EPM) and electron density.A theoretical parametric relationship (sio Index, \"stability in oil Index\") is developed to evaluate the stability of the molecular forms generated within the hydrocarbon. The following theoretical experiments were performed: First, successive interactions of water with P-80 from position 1 to position 21. Second, successive interactions from position 1 to position 21 of P-80 of water and ethanol, 1 to 1. Third, successive interactions with P-80 of 21 ethanol molecules on the final product of the first experiment. These theoretical results were compared with some experimental results obtained using Oil Mixtures. The results obtained and compared in both experimental series (theoretical and real) allow to distinguish the role of P-80, Ethanol, Water and ions for the improvement and recovery of the treated oil. It is concluded that the formulation that does not contain added water and sodium chloride is supposed to use the contaminating water present in the petroleum and the water contained in the ethanol (<5%).This formulation has very little effect on the resulting Density of the improved Oil, but it greatly decreases the resulting Viscosity in the Crude Oil. The formulation that contains more than 30% added Water decreases the Density while the Viscosity of the Crude Oil responds proportionally to the Water retained in it. This difference in the results could be interpreted as a different proportion and chemical composition as a consequence of a different structural relationship between these components and a different conformation of the nanoparticle generated within the Oil, in each case. In this sense, the hypothesis is established that there would be an intermediate molecular form that could improve both Viscosity and Density.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In the pooled analysis, peak to peak SEP amplitude was greater for both stepping conditions than standing (Standing vs. Straight, P=0.041; Standing vs. Diagonal, P=0.026).

Here, we used a combination of human psychophysical experiments, forward dynamic simulations, and mathematical optimization to reverse engineer arm positions ( REAP) used during motor planning. Subjects performed arm movements in a virtual environment under conditions where visual arm position cues were either aligned with corresponding somatosensory cues or were shifted prior to reach onset in one of four directions. Under shifted conditions, subjects exhibited characteristic  motor biases, i.e., systematic deviations from ideal trajectories to the visually-cued targets. The arm positions used to plan movements under shifted conditions were obtained by minimizing differences between the experimentally induced motor biases and simulated motor biases. These REAP estimates largely conformed to predictions derived from previous perceptual experiments in that they were strongly influenced by the visual cues, and in a manner that was axially dependent. The results suggest that assessments of position sense derived from motor biases can be used to augment perceptual assessments or be used in lieu of them when perceptual reporting isnt possible. In addition, the observed similarities between position estimates and weights derived from motor and perceptual tasks suggest that the brains perceptual and action systems use similar mechanisms to deduce arm position from somatosensory and visual cues.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

The mechanisms responsible for such slow dynamics are not understood. Here, we show that slow dynamics naturally and robustly emerges in dynamically-balanced networks of spiking neurons. This requires only partial symmetry in the synaptic connectivity, a feature of local cortical networks observed in experiments. The symmetry generates an effective, excitatory self-coupling of the neurons that leads to long-lived fluctuations in the network activity, without destroying the dynamical balance. When the excitatory self-coupling is suitably strong, the same mechanism leads to multiple equilibrium states of the network dynamics. Our results reveal a novel dynamical regime of the collective activity in spiking networks, where the memory of the initial state persists for very long times and ergodicity is broken.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Electroencephalographic recordings revealed that RP amplitude was significantly more negative during exhalation compared to inhalation and during breath-holding compared to normal breathing. These neural differences occurred without corresponding changes in behavioral measures (e.g., waiting times or retrospective timing judgments), indicating that respiratory effects on RP were not associated with altered action timing. These findings demonstrate that the respiratory phase causally modulates cortical motor preparation.

However, measurements most often rely on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response sampled with a gradient echo (GE) sequence, which is known to be most sensitive to macrovascular contributions that limit their effective spatial resolution. Alternatively, a spin echo (SE) sequence can be used to increase the weighting toward the microvasculature and, therefore, the location of neural activation. In addition, due to the heterogeneous structure of the cortical cerebrovascular system, the effective spatial resolution can change across cortical depth. For high-resolution fMRI applications, it is hence important to know how much the effective spatial resolution varies across cortical depth. In this study, we used flickering rotating wedge stimuli to induce traveling waves with varying spatial frequencies in the retinotopically organized primary visual cortex (V1), which allowed us to infer the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the BOLD response that characterizes the spatial specificity of the measured signal. We acquired GE- and SE-BOLD data at 7 T and compared the MTF between acquisition techniques at different cortical depths. Our results show a small but consistent increase in spatial specificity when using SE-BOLD. But across cortical depth, both acquisition techniques generally show a similar decrease of specificity toward the pial surface demonstrating the dependence on macrovascular contributions, which needs to be carefully considered when interpreting the results of high-resolution fMRI studies.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

METHODS: We performed electrophysiological recordings of single VTA dopamine neuron firing in the 3xTg-AD model, followed by recordings in amyloid (APPNL-G-F)- and human tau (hTau)-based models to determine the pathological triggers of impaired firing. RESULTS: In vivo dopamine neuron recordings showed fewer spikes in defined bursts in 3xTg-AD mice versus controls. Ex vivo studies showed an impaired ability to sustain firing during depolarization, which was mimicked with depolarized current in wild type neurons. Dopamine neurons transduced with hTau reflected firing aberrations and impaired bursting, but the effects were not recapitulated in the APPNL-G-F model, DISCUSSION: These results suggest that hTau specifically induces hyperexcitable states within individual dopamine neurons, disrupting burst firing.

Computational modelling identified that spatial representations are maintained in a dual eye-centred frame of reference which is actively updated by a noisy memory of saccades but is vulnerable to interference. Using this model, we found that specific mechanistic failures in initial encoding and memory decay, rather than the saccadic updating process itself, account for spatial working memory deficits in Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease.

An alluring formalism in computational neuroscience has been the generation of structural eigenmodes of neural activity from a matrix representing the anatomy of the brain. Traditionally, brain connectomics has been the gold standard for the coupling between structure and function. However, it has recently been suggested that simpler brain geometry can provide more explanatory power in fMRI. An adjacent modality is the source localisation problem of EEG, which aims to identify the underlying generators of EEG recordings. The underdetermined nature of the problem requires sufficient constraints to produce realistic and unique solutions of source activity. In this work, we presented a simple framework for incorporating different forms of structural brain eigenmodes to constrain the source localisation problem in epilepsy.

Analysis of TCGA datasets revealed that the co-occurrence of F. nucleatum and high NKp46 expression correlates with improved survival in head and neck cancers but not in colorectal cancers. Using binding assays, we demonstrate that both human NKp46 and its murine ortholog, Ncr1, directly recognize the fusobacterial adhesin RadD.

We also found that ex vivo Chlamydia-induced activation of B cells from the peripheral blood of humans or rhesus macaques (RM), or from murine splenocytes, generates cells with a phenotype characteristic of an activated antigen presenting cell (APC). Consistent with this phenotype, intravenous injection of Chlamydia-activated B cells (CAB) loaded with various cognate antigens (Ag) elicited robust Ag-specific T cell immunity in several experimental models. Specifically, RM injected with CAB loaded with a model Ag developed Ag-specific CD8+ T cell immunity and mice injected with Ag-loaded CAB formed CD8+ T cell immune responses that protected against virus challenge and tumor development.

CAR T cells binarized cytotoxic activities in response to a few binding events and population outcomes were dominated by a subset of cells. Activation at the single molecule level matches the sensitivity of the native T cell receptor (TCR) and points to potent downstream signal propagation. Disruption of the unligated TCR with a transmembrane-targeting inhibitory peptide strongly dampened CAR T cell activation, indicating a critical crosstalk between the two receptors.

We found impairments concerning late-born cells, including impaired rod function, a significantly reduced rod bipolar cell number and function, and a reduced Muller glia population. These defects seem to be caused by a delay in differentiation/ incomplete maturation, indicated by an enlarged progenitor zone at young ages and a residual immature cell population in the adult retina.

We adopted such an approach for stick lodges built by the bush Karoo rat (Otomys unisulcatus), a solitary rodent inhabiting semi-arid regions of southern Africa. These lodges are among the largest animal-built structures by solitary mammals, yet their structural variation and ecological function remain poorly quantified. We conducted the first population-level survey of all lodges in our 4.5 ha field site to assess external and internal lodge structure, assess their effects on microclimate, and tested experimentally whether lodge size affects microclimate. Lodges were several hundred times larger than their builders and featured complex structure, including basking platforms, nesting, food and latrine chambers. Inside lodges, temperatures were closer to the bush Karoo rats thermoneutral zone and exhibited higher humidity than ambient conditions, which could reduce costs of thermoregulation and reduce water loss. These benefits correlated with initial lodge size and decreased when lodge size was experimentally reduced. Tunnels were often blocked off with thorny branches, possibly to deter snakes. Platforms typically faced eastwards and were regularly used for basking, likely enhancing passive heat gain. We conclude that bush Karoo rat lodges are complex, and costly to build and maintain. They improve thermoregulation and provide predator protection and food storage. Bush Karoo rat lodges (1) are external structures, adding to the builders body (2) are functional, (3) probably increasing fitness, (4) result from behavioural activity, and (5) are likely genetically encoded.

Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models were employed to model time-dependent transitions, whereas Boolean logic models simulated binary molecular switches. Comparative reward pathway diagrams were drawn to represent divergent neuropharmacological cascades triggered by CBD and THC. Our simulations show that CBD triggers redox restoration, inhibits inflammatory cytokines, and induces dopaminergic and synaptic stability. Withdrawal simulation also showed that relapse of the partial system could be triggered if CBD is withdrawn suddenly, substantiating its status as a homeostatic stabilizer and not a suppressive one. Network pharmacology fit scoring exhibited CBD's high concordance with antioxidant and neuroplasticity targets, whereas THC mostly mapped onto reward-amplifying nodes. Though these results are hypothesis-driven and computational, they also offer a useful framework for the experimental validation. This work illustrates the utility of INP-based simulations in deciphering polypharmacological drugs such as CBD and presents a scalable paradigm for assaying future candidates for neurotherapeutic use in the study of addiction.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we challenge this assumption through advanced atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that combine parallel tempering and well-tempered metadynamics to probe the thermodynamics and folding pathways of LanM under apo conditions. By mapping the folding free energy landscape, identifying unfolded, misfolded and folded basins, and integrating contact map analysis, reactive folding trajectory analysis and diffusion map-based dimensionality reduction, we discover a striking deviation from canonical models: LanM spontaneously adopts a native-like fold, including structured EF-hand motifs and a well-formed hydrophobic core, even in the absence of metal ions. We find that the LanM folding mechanism proceeds via a two-step pathway - initial entropically driven collapse into a metastable misfolded ensemble that retain partial or full helices but in misaligned arrangements, followed by an enthalpically favorable reorganization into the folded state. Folding trajectories and diffusion map-based embeddings further reveal and distinguishes pathway multiplicity: some transitions proceed directly from the unfolded to the folded state, while others transiently occupy the misfolded basin, underscoring kinetic heterogeneity and misfolded basin's role as an accessible but non-obligate intermediate. Taken together, these findings challenge the prevailing view of LanM as a purely metal-induced folder and instead support a model of intrinsic foldability, where native-like features emerge spontaneously and prime the protein for ion binding. Beyond refining our understanding of EF-hand protein folding, these results have direct implications for rare earth separation technologies, where the conformational readiness of apo-LanM could inspire the design of next-generation bioseparation platforms.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Despite evidence indicating a complex interplay between stress, diet and obesity, there is a limited understanding of the specific versus potentially synergistic effects of obesity and stress on brain structural and functional development. This study investigates the developmental and long-term brain structural alterations resulting from exposure to chronic social stress due to low (subordinate -SUB-) social status and postnatal obesogenic diets. Forty-one female rhesus macaques (Dominants -DOM-, n=21; Subordinates -SUB-, n=20) were assigned to either only low-calorie diet (LCD) or to both high-calorie diet (HCD) and LCD (Choice diet) from birth through the juvenile period. After menarche, all subjects were maintained on a LCD-only diet through adulthood. Twenty-seven animals (DOM: n=13, SUB: n=14) were studied again in adulthood to investigate the long-term effects of early diet and social rank on brain structure. Cumulative Kcal consumption was measured from birth through 16 months and body weights were measured at all time points.\n\nOverall, the findings show specific effects of obesogenic diet and psychosocial stress on cortical and corticolimbic brain regions. Animals with access to the obesogenic diet had larger overall brain size (measured as intracranial volume -ICV-) and larger overall volumes of prefrontal cortex, insula, superior temporal sulcus (defined as temporo-parieto-occipital area rostral and caudal regions (TPOr and TPOc)) than those in the low-calorie diet. Most of these regional diet effects, except for the insula, were driven by general effects of the diet on brain size. The diet effects were lost when adding the adult data to the longitudinal analysis, suggesting transient effects of obesogenic diets while the animals were consuming it, but not long-term, persistent effects. These findings highlight the potential of brain rescue mechanisms that could offset lasting developmental effects of early-life obesogenic diet consumption. With respect to social rank, SUB exhibited larger volumes in brain regions related to social cognition and emotional processing than DOM animals. When the adult data was added to the longitudinal analysis, the effects of social rank were prominent in the hippocampus, superior temporal sulcus, temporo-parieto-occipital rostral region, and the temporal auditory cortices after ICV data correction, suggesting long-term, persistent and cumulative effects of these social experiences, in contrast to the transient diet effects.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

We and others have shown that the indoor flame retardants, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), reduce prosocial behavior, however, few studies have assessed the central targets and underlying mechanisms. PBDEs are well established endocrine disruptors of the expanded thyroid system, which also regulates the prosocial neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) and their hypothalamic signaling. The potential role of PBDE-induced thyroid hormone (TH) deregulation in mediating disruption of central OXT and ASD-like social behavior deficits remains unmapped. To address this gap, we conducted a study in C57BL6/N mice that examined behavioral and neuromolecular reprogramming after developmental exposure to the commercial PBDE mixture, DE-71, and evaluated the therapeutic potential of TH supplementation. Dams were exposed daily during gestation and lactation to corn oil vehicle, low dose (0.1 mg/kg) and high dose (0.4 mg/kg) of DE-71 with or without concurrent L-thyroxine (+mT4). In offspring, dose-dependent ASD-relevant behavioral responses and central neuroendocrine OXT neuron depletion after developmental PBDE exposure was prevented with mT4. mRNA transcripts for the TH transporter Mct8, deiodinase (Dio3) and estrogen receptor beta (Esr2) expressed on OXT neurons in PVH were upregulated in low dose females. In contrast, Mct8 and Dio3 were downregulated in low dose males. These findings uncover sex-specific mechanisms of PBDE-induced reprogramming of TH-regulated pathways in hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells leading to depleted central OXT signaling and ultimately ASD-relevant phenotypes.

Y.; Verdier, D.; Kolta, A.", "abstract": "Mastication is a vital function that relies on precise synchronization among multiple brainstem regions, known as being part of a central pattern generator (CPG). Movements can be triggered either by stimulating a sensory-motor region called the cortical masticatory area (CMA), well-documented in various species but not yet formally identified in mice, or by stimulating the oro-facial sensory primary afferents which fibers form the trigeminal tract (Vtr). However, it's unclear whether these different inputs activate distinct components of the CPG or converge on the same. This study aims at mapping brainstem areas activated by cortical and sensory inputs using immunohistochemistry against the cellular activity marker, c-Fos and Ca2+-imaging, respectively. Optogenetic stimulation of the cortical masticatory area (CMA) in awake, head-fixed mice reliably induced rhythmic jaw movements (RJMs) and increased c-Fos expression in multiple brainstem regions, with strongest activation in the peritrigeminal area (PeriV) and parvocellular reticular formation (PCRt) ventral to the trigeminal motor nucleus (NVmt). In contrast, in vitro electrical stimulation of trigeminal sensory afferents (Vtr) predominantly activated neurons and astrocytes in the main sensory nucleus (NVsnpr), the dorsal area of PeriV, adjacent to it, and PCRt. The areas containing the highest numbers of activated cells differed clearly according to the type of inputs and overlapped only in the PCRt, ventral and slightly medial to the trigeminal motor nucleus and the most dorso-medial part of PeriV. These findings demonstrate that cortical and sensory inputs take part in distinct components of the brainstem masticatory circuitry, with PCRt emerging as a point of convergence and provide new insights into the components of the CPG of mastication.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

While its thermodynamic footprint -including heat and entropy generation- is experimentally known, it is typically regarded as a passive consequence of signal propagation. This work explores the hypothesis that this thermodynamic output is not passive, but instead plays an active role in modulating neural function. To investigate this, we developed a novel, fully coupled electro-thermo-entropic model where the entropy generated by an action potential directly feeds back to influence the kinetics of ion channels. Our simulations demonstrate a profound consequence of this coupling: the action potential undergoes progressive self-amplification, driven by a massive acceleration of its underlying kinetics. As the signal propagates, its peak amplitude grows significantly while its temporal duration remains remarkably stable. Furthermore, a statistical analysis reveals that this mechanism relies on the system operating as a robust thermodynamic switch, transitioning between a low-entropy quiescent state and a high-dissipation active state. Finally, we show that achieving this high-performance, amplifying state requires a disproportionately high energetic cost, a finding we term the Intelligence Premium. These results suggest that the action potential is a coupled electro-thermodynamic process that actively enhances its own strength and reliability. Our model offers a candidate mechanism for how waste energy is repurposed into a functional signal, providing a physical explanation for the brain's high energy consumption and opening new perspectives on the link between thermodynamics and computation.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

OMNIMap integrates extended-focus optical coherence microscopy and learning-based segmentation with global vessel-graph optimization to resolve artery-vein classification and branching order, linking capillary flow and stalls to broader network context. Applied to over 40,000 capillaries in the mouse cortex before and after ischemic stroke, we observe heterogeneous vulnerability patterns: while most capillaries stall or reduce flow after arterial occlusion, some experience accelerated flow. Further analysis revealed that stall-prone flow topology subtypes were less prevalent than their robust counterparts.

Increasing evidence highlights PIEZO2 as the primary transducer of low-threshold mechanical force in DRG neurons. However, in the absence of Piezo2, mice and humans still respond to noxious painful stimuli like pinch, suggesting that additional MA channel(s) likely exist in DRG neurons. Strategies to identify Cre lines and DRG subpopulations that select for non-PIEZO2 expressing neurons is therefore an ongoing effort in the field to discover unknown mechanosensors. Here, we investigated a Vglut3 labeled mouse line as a candidate to identify non-PIEZO2 MA channels in a subtype of DRG neurons called C-fiber low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs). Our study carefully demonstrates that the Vglut3-IRES-Cre mouse line specifically and efficiently labels C-LTMR neurons of the DRG. Electrophysiological recordings using two different in vitro mechanical stimulation assays show that the genetically labelled Vglut3 neurons have robust indentation- and stretch-activated MA currents that are exclusively slowly or ultra-slowly adapting. To determine whether the Vglut3-IRES-Cre mouse line can be used to delete genes of interest and identify the underlying MA ion channels in C-LTMRs we attempted to generate a Tmem63b conditional knockout using this Cre-line but detected incomplete loss of Tmem63b transcript and lack of TMEM63B-dependent effect on C-LTMR MA currents.

Both stimuli can positively or negatively influence each others effects on MC activation in a gene-dependent manner.

To decipher the role(s) of SMAD2 in MCs, SMAD2 was ablated in PMC-306 MCs using CRISPR/Cas9, and the effects were studied after TGF-{beta} and/or Ag stimulation. The absence of SMAD2 led to increased proliferation and survival, as well as decreased transcription of target genes like Smad7 and Jun in steady state and after TGF-{beta} treatment. Interestingly, SMAD2 was found to regulate the strength and kinetics of TGF-{beta}-mediated SMAD1/5 activation, resulting in augmented expression of genes like Id2 and Id3 in SMAD2-deficient MCs.

We detected considerable variation in grooming network structure across the papionins, even within the classic single-level societies. The papionins could be best divided into three broad categories: single-level cohesive, single-level cliquish, and multi-level. The cohesive single-level societies formed networks that were dense, moderately kin-biased, and weakly rank-structured, while the cliquish single-level societies formed networks that were relatively modular, highly kin-biased, and more strongly rank-structured. As expected, multi-level networks were highly modular and shaped by females' ties to specific dominant males but varied in their kin biases.

Taking advantage of these unique artificial features to fine-tune and adapt the architecture, we demonstrate for the first time that DNA coding scheme constraints can be leveraged to optimise basecallers. Using low-rank adaptation on the basecalling model, we achieve substantial gains with high resource efficiency. Additionally, constraint-aware beam search provides improvements without requiring model retraining.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The problem of building genome-wide predictors of individual risk to complex diseases seems to be more challenging than it was thought when the first human genome was sequenced on 2003. We have build different enhanced genetic risk predictors from genome-wide data and different complex diseases, making use of haplotypes accurately ascertained from family trios. We confirmed the widely known inability to accurately predict individual risk to complex diseases returned by the state-of-the-art genome-wide predictors. This result is mainly due to the small effect that most genetic variants have in a disease. We also found out that rates of missing genotypes were usually too high for these small-effect variants, as we could force missing imputation in such a tricky way that we would build highly accurate predictors, either by using our own design or the state-of-the-art genetic predictors. We observed that unknown genotypes were not missing at random but related to disease affectation, with more missing genotypes in affected than in non-affected individuals. We were not able to find a way to accurately reduce missing rates to correctly improve accuracy, but we identified a common pattern of missing data in multiple sclerosis, asthma and autism that makes us think that other complex diseases could behave the same way. Because (1) missing rates are high enough to completely change risk prediction due to the small-effect of most of the variants, and (2) there are more missing genotypes in affected than in non affected individuals, we conclude that perhaps the widely known defeat in genomic profiling for complex diseases may be solved by looking closer to the way current genotyping technologies handle genetic variants that may be rare in reference panels but have some effect in a given complex disease.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

A single protein may exist in multiple variant forms, each potentially leading to distinct phenotypic consequences depending on how the alterations affect its structure, function, or expression. Missense variants are single-nucleotide substitutions in the DNA sequence that cause the replacement of one amino acid with another in the corresponding protein, potentially affecting its structure, stability, and function. The clinical interpretation of missense variants in protein-coding regions remains a challenge in genomic medicine. Recent advances in protein language models and manifold learning offer new opportunities for the unsupervised extraction of biologically relevant information from protein sequences. This study integrates representations derived from Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM2), a family of large-scale protein language models, with nonlinear dimensionality reduction via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a technique used to visualize high-dimensional data, to improve the classification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in disease-associated proteins.

Yet, literature-based analyses of GRNs often treat gene regulations as context-independent interactions, overlooking how their biological relevance can differ depending on the disease type, cell lineage, or experimental condition. Results: In an attempt to improve on existing methods for leveraging knowledge present in the scientific literature, we developed a framework to assign quantitative, context-dependent weights to gene regulations extracted from literature. We demonstrate that the context-specific GRNs reconstructed with our method can effectively capture disease biology, showing strong correlation with transcriptomics across a wide range of diseases. Furthermore, we show that utilizing contextual information improves accuracy in drug-target prediction tasks. Finally, we showcase the utility of the contextualized GRNs through the automated construction of an ordinary differential equation model of a breast cancer-specific signaling network. The large language model-based framework allows the integration of literature- and experimentally derived information and streamlines the process of assembling a biologically relevant and functional mathematical model.

Accurate prediction of coaxial stacking is critical for RNA 3D structure modeling, yet existing computational tools remain limited, especially for junctions with variable numbers of branches or complex topologies. Here, we present gCoSRNA, a generalizable computational framework for predicting coaxial stacking configurations using RNA sequence and secondary structure as input. Instead of developing separate models for each junction type, gCoSRNA decomposes multi-way junctions into all possible adjacent stem pairs, termed pseudo two-way junctions, and uses a unified random forest classifier to evaluate stacking probabilities. Global stacking configurations are inferred by integrating these pairwise predictions, eliminating the need for explicit junction-type classification. Benchmarking on two independent test sets, including CASP15/16 and RNA-Puzzles targets, shows that gCoSRNA achieves consistently high accuracy (mean ~0.87) across junctions with two to seven branches, outperforming existing junction-specific methods. These results highlight the model's ability to capture higher-order structural features and its potential utility in RNA tertiary structure prediction pipelines.

However, despite its widespread use, the prognosis remains poor, underscoring the need for not just better treatments, but also better ways to understand how cells respond to them. Since the efficacy of TMZ is partly driven by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), being able to track oxidative stress within cells can offer meaningful insights into treatment response and resistance. In this context, T1 relaxometry using nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) offers a sensitive and reliable method to monitor intracellular changes, including ROS levels, with nanoscale precision. In this study, we used U87-MG GBM cells to investigate ROS generation following TMZ treatment at 250 M and 1000 M concentrations. Fixed cells were analyzed using T1 relaxometry of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in NDs as intracellular sensors, and the data were compared against untreated controls. A concentration-dependent decrease in T1 relaxation time was observed with increasing TMZ dose, indicating elevated radical production. These results affirm that NDs can robustly detect intracellular ROS in response to chemotherapeutic stress. Importantly, the study highlights a critical therapeutic insight: while TMZ typically induces ROS generation contributing to cell death, resistant cells often exhibit reduced ROS levels due to heightened antioxidant responses. Thus, in contexts where T1 times remain unchanged or increase post-treatment, the lack of ROS elevation may serve as an early indicator of drug resistance. Taken together, this work establishes ND based T1 relaxometry as a powerful tool to probe oxidative stress dynamics and assess drug responsiveness at the single-cell level, while also suggesting a framework for overcoming practical challenges in ND-based intracellular sensing.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

The role of DDIT4L in regulating tumor growth was analyzed using lentivirus and PDX model. The mechanism of DDIT4L on GBM mitochondrial function was determined by different assays. Here, we show that DDIT4L is an endogenous inhibitor of GBM via suppressing mitochondrial function. DDIT4L was expressed at high levels in GBM and transported into mitochondria via single import channel TOM40 other than the import receptors TOM22, TOM20 or TOM70. Then, DDIT4L interacted with the subunit of ATP synthase, inhibited mitochondrial function and induced tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the synthetic peptide DDIT4LV125-P132 suppressed GBM oncogenesis.

NAD+ biosynthesis, regulated by the enzymes NAPRT and NAMPT, represents a metabolic vulnerability due to high NAD+ turnover in cancers. Although NAMPT inhibitors (NAMPTi) show preclinical promise, clinical translation has been limited by toxicity and the lack of predictive biomarkers. Here, we evaluated NAPRT expression in RMS and its potential as an actionable biomarker to guide NAMPTi therapy. Experimental Design: NAPRT promoter methylation, transcript levels, and protein expression were assessed in RMS cells, PDXs, and primary tumors (n = 109) from the Children's Oncology Group. In vitro sensitivity to NAMPTi was tested in molecularly diverse and isogenic RMS cell lines, examining the role of NAPRT expression in mediating cytotoxicity and the ability of nicotinic acid (NA) to rescue viability. In vivo efficacy was assessed using NAPRT-isogenic orthotopic xenograft models. Results: NAPRT promoter hypermethylation was found in a subset of RMS models and patient samples. Immunohistochemistry showed loss of NAPRT protein in 30 - 40 of tumors, defined as less than 1% tumor cell staining. Methylation modestly correlated with protein expression. NAPRT-silenced cells were highly sensitive to NAMPTi, driven by NAD+ depletion and not reversible with NA. In vivo, NAMPTi induced significant tumor regression, which was not abrogated with NA administration in NAPRT-silenced models. Conclusions: NAPRT loss occurs in a subset of RMS, offering a potential strategy to expand the therapeutic window of NAMPTi. Further research is needed to understand NAPRT regulation and optimize biomarker assay strategies for use in future clinical trials.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Methods: An ethanolic extract of C. sativa seeds was prepared. GC-MS analysis was performed to identify the compounds in the extract. The cytotoxicity of the extract on PANC-1 cells and HFF cells was assessed using MTT assay. Colony formation and Wound healing assays were used to evaluate the impact of the extract on the ability of PANC-1 cells to form colonies and migrate. Flow cytometry analysis evaluated cell cycle phase of PANC-1 cells after treatment with the extract. Results: The C. sativa seed extract had anti-proliferative effects on pancreatic cancer cells PANC-1, while showing no such an effect on normal HFF cells. The extract made its impact on PANC-1 cells by arresting them at G1 phase and increasing their apoptosis. Furthermore it inhibited PANC-1 colony formation and changed the colony combination in favor of paraclones. Migration capacity of PANC-1 cells was also attenuated by the extract.

ATM inhibitors (ATMi) are therefore being explored as adjuvants in radiotherapy to both enhance radiosensitivity and minimise normal tissue complications. The molecule AZD1390 has been developed as an inhibitor of ATM and is undergoing assessment in clinical trials. However, traditional markers of DNA DSB repair, such as {gamma}H2AX, represent stages of DDR downstream from the action of ATM. The ATMi AZD1390, developed by AstraZeneca, ultimately prevents phosphorylation of the H2AX histone variant. In order to quantify ATMi AZD1390 action, the novel and highly complementary assay SensiTive Recognition of Individual DNA Ends (STRIDE) was employed to directly quantify DSBs in comparison to {gamma}H2AX after X-ray irradiation of 4T1 cells. Findings revealed that ATM inhibition via AZD1390 delays DSB repair initiation and appears to play a greater role in suppressing DDR beyond ATM inhibition alone. In X-ray irradiated conditions, obfuscation of DSBs commenced between 30- to 45-minutes post-irradiation without AZD1390 versus 45 to 60-minutes for cells pretreated with AZD1390 and entirely prevented {gamma}H2AX in the majority of cells. STRIDE and {gamma}H2AX exhibited almost no co-localization indicating that they provide distinct and complementary information. DSB formation was also assessed in cells fixed pre-insult to minimise any biological response, providing unprecedented assessment of DSB formation.

A total of 36 samples collected from diverse localities across Iran, representing different ecological regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct clades: one comprising western Iranian samples clustering with European (mostly from Germany) samples, and the other consisting of eastern and southern Iranian samples that shared haplotypes with populations from China. Notably, the western Iranian clade exhibited a minimal genetic distance from European populations, while the eastern Iranian clade was genetically similar to Chinese B. bubo subspecies, including B. bubo turkomanus. The genetic diversity indices for the Iranian population were relatively low, with three identified haplotypes and low nucleotide and haplotype diversity. Demographic analyses indicated a potential population expansion for the species, supported by a unimodal mismatch distribution and negative neutrality indices, although these results were not statistically significant for the Iranian population.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand how routine captive procedures may influence parasite infections. In this study, we exposed captive bred tokay geckos (Gekko gecko) to two stressors common in the reptile trade, cohabitation with a novel conspecific and a change in diet. We tested their effect on fecal oxyurid output compared to a control group as well as their combined effect. We found that a single stressor had no effect on fecal parasite load while both combined did significantly increase parasite load.

Utilising integrated analysis of single-cell genomic data, we identified CD8+ T cell effector transcriptional networks that are restrained in the naive state by the chromatin binding protein Special AT-rich sequence binding protein-1 (SATB1). Utilising a SATB1-Tg model, whereby activated CD8+ T cells are unable to down regulate SATB1 upon activation, we observed limited effector differentiation and an inability to engage effector programs in response to both primary and secondary influenza A virus infection. Mechanistically, SATB1 limited chromatin remodelling at key gene loci required for the full engagement of the CD8+ T cell effector program.

The lethal impacts of an introduced predator such as cats on wildlife can be further exacerbated by the introduction of an additional abundant non-native prey species capable of supporting an exceptionally dense predator population, a phenomenon known as hyperpredation. A special case of hyperpredation involves human food subsidies, when an invasive predator impacting native wildlife is supported not by another invasive taxon, but by human-derived food sources. To test whether access to anthropogenic food subsidies by cats is causing hyperpredation, mark-recapture methodology was used to measure twelve cat populations experiencing a gradient of human subsidies on the Mediterranean island of Naxos, Greece. Line-transect surveys were conducted at each site to measure reptile population abundance across this gradient, and other factors including human density and distance of reptiles from villages were considered as well. Strong evidence was found that the population size of cats is a direct result of the density of anthropogenic food available to them, and a corresponding decline in the size of reptile populations as cat density increased was observed. It was also shown that as cat populations exceed the available supply of human food, the negative effects of cat density on reptile populations are exacerbated. These results demonstrate that access to anthropogenic subsidies has allowed cat populations to expand to exceptional levels, driving hyperpredation on island wildlife.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

The rapid nature of this review carries an inherent risk of time bias, as studies published after the search date are not included. Result: The analysis reveals a significant discrepancy between the species' official national status and the findings from high-quality longitudinal studies. While the national Red List assesses the species as \"Least Concern,\" the most robust evidence indicates severe and rapid local population declines. The primary identified threats are habitat fragmentation from infrastructure and urban development, and acute effects of climate change, particularly extreme drought. A critical gap in national environmental monitoring was also identified, with no dedicated, systematic programme for reptiles. Conclusion: The probable national trend for the adder in Sweden is a slow, cryptic decline driven by local extirpations. The official \"Least Concern\" status risks being a lagging indicator that masks underlying threats. Discussion: The findings highlight a paradox where the most reliable, high-resolution scientific data conflicts with broad-scale national assessments. This suggests that the current conservation status may engender a false sense of security, potentially delaying necessary conservation interventions. The lack of a national monitoring programme is a major limitation to evidence-based management. Recommendations include establishing such a programme and integrating habitat connectivity into landscape planning to mitigate the impacts of fragmentation.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

N.; Franks, S. J.; Anderson, J. T.; Hamann, E.", "abstract": "Global change has profoundly altered the eco-evolutionary trajectories of plant species. Longitudinal studies often document phenotypic shifts in response to climate change, such as earlier flowering in the spring, but it remains challenging to disentangle the contributions of phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution to shifted phenotypic distributions. The resurrection approach has emerged as a powerful method to study genetic and plastic responses to novel selection imposed by global change by contrasting ancestral and descendant lineages from the same population under common conditions. Here, we compiled a database of 52 resurrection studies to examine key hypotheses about plant evolutionary responses to global change using a meta-analysis (40 of the studies) and quantitative review (all 52 studies). We found evidence for rapid, contemporary evolution, which often appeared adaptive, in over half of the cases, including some of the fastest cases of evolution in natural populations ever observed. Annual plants evolved earlier reproduction, and leaf economic traits associated with stress escape strategies. We also found evolution of increased plasticity for annual plants in phenology and physiology traits, and a reduction of plasticity in traits related to the leaf economic spectrum. We found less evidence for evolution in perennial species. Overall, our findings demonstrate the key role of drought escape in plant responses to a warming world. However, the lack of evolution in other traits and species indicates that constraints may dampen evolutionary responses in some scenarios. Our review also suggests promising avenues of future research for resurrection studies.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Understanding how genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions influence evolutionary trajectories and contribute to historical contingency is key to predicting evolution. In spatially structured, heterogeneous environments, populations often diversify into ecotypes, resulting in niche specialization. However, the ability to specialize depends not only on ecological opportunity but also on whether genetic variation permits access to novel niches, as genetic disruptions may inhibit adaptation unless alternative trajectories or compensatory mutations are subsequently accessible. Previously, we demonstrated that Escherichia coli populations rapidly diversify into two co-existing ecotypes in a nutrient-rich, spatially structured environment. The adaptation of both ecotypes results in benefits only perceived in the spatially structured culture tube environment. Here, diversification is initiated by first-step mutations associated with the overexpression of genes encoding the type 1 fimbria, the major attachment pilus involved in biofilm development, enabling range expansion and allowing E. coli to occupy the surface-air interface of the culture tube. To investigate how first-step mutations shape evolutionary trajectories, we experimentally evolved wild-type and fimbrial-deficient ({Delta}fimA) E. coli for 91 days in both structured (tube) and unstructured (flask) environments. While a fimA deletion initially confers a fitness benefit by avoiding the cost of insufficient biofilm formation, it ultimately prevents range expansion in structured environments and is not compensated by expression of cryptic fimbriae by the end of experimental evolution. As a result,{Delta} fimA populations show constrained adaptation in tubes compared to wild-type. Alternatively, both genotypes perform similarly in flasks, where biofilm formation is not advantageous and whole population sequencing reveals that flask-evolved populations similar early mutational trajectories. Our results highlight the ruggedness of the adaptive landscape in structured environments and show how an initially beneficial mutation can trap a lineage on a local fitness peak, underscoring the importance of GxE interactions and early mutational events in shaping the predictability and contingency of evolutionary outcomes.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that NAC is a multifaceted regulator that coordinates translation elongation, cotranslational folding, and organelle targeting through distinct interactions with nascent polypeptides both inside and outside the ribosome exit tunnel. Using NAC-selective ribosome profiling in C. elegans, we identify thousands of sequence-specific NAC binding events across the nascent proteome, revealing broad cotranslational engagement with hydrophobic and helical motifs in cytosolic, nuclear, ER, and mitochondrial proteins. Unexpectedly, we discover an intra-tunnel sensing mode, where NAC engages ribosomes with extremely short nascent polypeptides inside the exit tunnel in a sequence-specific manner. These early NAC interactions induce an early elongation slowdown that tunes ribosome flux and prevent ribosome collisions, linking NACs chaperone activity to kinetic control of translation. We propose that NAC action protects aggregation-prone intermediates by shielding amphipathic helices thus promoting cytonuclear folding and supporting mitochondrial membrane protein biogenesis and ER targeting by early recognition of signal sequences and transmembrane domain. Our findings establish NAC as an early-acting, multifaceted orchestrator of cotranslational proteostasis, with distinct mechanisms of action on nascent chains depending on their sequence features and subcellular destinations.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In this work, using high-resolution sequence-specific coarse-grained models combined with well-tempered metadynamics and parallel tempering, we investigate how heterochromatin protein (HP1) and a truncated construct of Polyhomeotic-like protein (tPHC3) influence the stability and folding pathways of tetra-nucleosomes, a minimal yet functionally informative chromatin model, under dilute and dense-phase conditions. While these proteins are known to drive distinct nuclear condensates their differential impact on chromatin topology and folding dynamics remains unclear. To address this, we ask: Do HP1 and tPHC3 stabilize or disrupt the canonical {beta}-rhombus and -tetrahedron nucleosome conformations? Are -tetrahedron motifs transient intermediates or metastable states, and how do their prevalence and persistence depend on protein identity and phase context? To answer these questions, we analyze folding free energy landscapes, diffusion maps-based dimensionality reduced coordinates, and intermolecular interaction networks. Our simulations reveal that HP1 promote flexible, short-range nucleosome bridging and transient -tetrahedron-like intermediates without stabilizing persistent structural basins. In contrast, tPHC3 stabilize -tetrahedron-like motifs that scaffold folding toward the compact {beta}-rhombus configuration characteristic of crystal-state tetra-nucleosomes. We find that this behavior arises from a context-dependent reorganization of multivalent SAM-linker interactions: in the absence of chromatin, self-association in dense phase conditions is mediated by linker-linker and linker-SAM contacts, while in the presence of nucleosomes, these linker-mediated interactions are suppressed, prompting compensatory SAM-SAM assembly. This reorganization highlights the essential role of SAM-mediated bridging in enabling long-range chromatin compaction. Together, our results demonstrate that under dense phase conditions -tetrahedron-like motifs act as metastable intermediates rather than obligate folding end states, and their emergence depends critically on the identity of the chromatin-binding protein and their ability to mediate bridging. These insights offer a mechanistic framework for understanding how distinct architectural proteins encode topological preferences and remodel chromatin architecture across scales to support condensate formation and nuclear compartmentalization.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

However, many current NIR-II nanoprobes show suboptimal brightness and limited validations in more human-centric models. Here, we present an orthogonal strategy combining molecular engineering, by modulating the amount and position of thiophene moieties in semiconducting polymers (SPs), with protein nanoengineering to develop ultrabright NIR-II imaging probes optimized for ex vivo bioimaging in large animal models. The molecular tuning amplifies the NIR-II fluorescence brightness while screening endogenous proteins as encapsulating matrices to improve colloidal stability and enable active targeting. Molecular docking identified bovine serum albumin as the effective candidate, and the resulting protein-complexed nanoprobes were characterized for size, colloidal stability under physiological conditions, and optical performances. Imaging performances were evaluated using tumor-mimicking phantoms in porcine lungs, simulating cancer surgery, and injected at clinically relevant concentrations into ovine brains and porcine ovaries for microvascular visualization and tissue discrimination, respectively.

In C. elegans, inhibiting autophagy can shorten, lengthen or have no effect on lifespan. Differences between published findings likely reflect variability in experimental conditions. Here we investigate the condition dependence of effects on lifespan of RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) knockdown of autophagy pathway components. Effects on several interventions causing a strong Age (increased lifespan) phenotype were examined, including mutation of daf-2 (insulin/IGF-1 receptor). Factors varied included daf-2 mutant allele class, atg gene, temperature and presence of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUDR). Effects on lifespan of atg RNAi proved to be highly condition dependent. Notably, for most atg genes tested lifespan was not usually reduced more in the long-lived mutant than in the wild-type control. This occurred at 20{ring}C for certain atg genes with daf-2(e1368) but not daf-2(e1370). At 25{ring}C, little reduction in lifespan was seen. However, atg-18 knockdown behaved differently, suppressing daf-2 Age under all conditions, suggesting possible pleiotropic action. Presence of high concentration FUDR caused knockdown of several atg genes to increase lifespan. Thus, depending on experimental conditions, atg knockdown can increase, decrease or have no effect on daf-2 Age. The lack of suppression of Age by atg RNAi in most cases raises questions about the importance of autophagy in daf-2 Age.

Its spread is dependent upon temperature and humidity, which are expected to fluctuate strongly due to climate change. Previous results have highlighted that temperature elevation led to an increase in disease severity in commercial cultivars, whose resistance is quantitative and mostly relies on the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) bwr-6 and bwr-12. In this study, we focused on temperature-dependent quantitative disease resistance (QDR) to bacterial wilt with the aim to unravel new resistance mechanisms that remain efficient at higher temperatures. For this purpose, a new panel of 189 accessions composed of tomato wild relatives, was assembled and sequenced thus creating a unique genomic resource. Its response to the Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum strain GMI1000 from three- to ten-days post-inoculation at 28{degrees}C and 32{degrees}C was explored. To discover the genetic basis underlying the responses of the panel, Genome-Wide Association (GWA) studies were conducted using the disease symptom scores recorded daily and monitored throughout the kinetics of the infection. To improve QTL detection, we have proposed a new approach using two reference genomes from within the panel. By correcting part of a single reference genome, especially when the only reference genome is a cultivar, this approach may be considered an alternative to pangenomic studies. As panel sequencing was highly resolutive, QTL positions allowed the identification of 44 candidate genes, which seemed to follow a temporal dynamic of activation after pathogen inoculation. Interestingly, no candidate genes were found to be common between the two phenotyping temperatures, highlighting the importance of the experimental design in addressing this type of question. Most of our quantitative disease resistance candidate genes belong to gene families described as being involved in immunity.

Despite its compact 3.2-kb genome, HBV exhibits extensive alternative splicing. Functionally, HBV splice variants contribute to immune evasion and reduce the likelihood of achieving a functional cure. Here, we show that HBV splicing efficiency - quantified from 279 RNA-seq libraries of HBV-associated liver biopsies and cultured cells - correlates more strongly with disease progression than the overall proportion of spliced HBV RNAs, an emerging biomarker. All HBV splice sites are embedded within protein-coding regions, forming a genetic architecture distinct from typical host splice sites. To decode the sequence determinants of HBV splicing, we apply transformer-based and deep learning models to 4,707 HBV genomes. These models reveal that more highly used HBV splice sites are more conserved and share features with host splice sites that are less frequently used but still functional. This similarity likely reflects constraints imposed by HBV's compact genome, which must accommodate overlapping protein-coding regions. HBV may have evolved to exploit suboptimal but spliceable host-like motifs without disrupting its genetic architecture. Further analysis of splicing propensity across HBV genomes reveals genotype-specific patterns, indicating regulation by sequence context in a site- and genotype-dependent manner.

High genomic instability of these cancers leads to chromosomal breaks (breakpoints), which disrupt the physical connection between genes and adjacent regulatory elements. Standard molQTL methods are unable to accommodate breakpoint information and would therefore indiscriminately test associations across breakpoints, leading to spurious signals and reduced biological relevance. To address these challenges, we developed SegmentQTL, a segmentation-aware molQTL analysis tool, designed to improve the accuracy of association testing in unstable cancer genomes by incorporating sample-specific breakpoint information. Results: SegmentQTL applies an integrated purifying filtering step that removes associations spanning breakpoints, ensuring that only variants within the same segment as the phenotype are tested. This prevents false discoveries and reduces background noise. We evaluated SegmentQTL on selected genes from stable and unstable genomic regions and compared its results with a previously published state-of-the-art tool. In stable regions, SegmentQTL produced similar results, validating its approach. In unstable regions, however, the filtering step refined detected associations by shifting peak locations and removing artefactual signals that would arise if genomic instability were not properly accounted for.

Although intracellular crowding is known to strongly alter macromolecule mobility, how cytoplasmic structures physically modulate diffusion remains largely unexplored. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic crowding controls diffusivity using live-cell experiments and porous media modeling approaches. Confocal microscopy combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements revealed an anti-correlation between free-GFP diffusivity and the heterogeneous cytoplasmic structure abundance in live mammalian cells. This motivated the development of a multiscale model, where the cytoplasm is treated as a hierarchical porous medium with nanometric and micrometric obstacles. Numerically solving the model allowed us to predict the effective cytoplasmic diffusion coefficient for various obstacle volume fractions, and to identify tortuous and porous hydrodynamic hindrances as key diffusion reduction mechanisms. Comparison with our experimental results highlighted the importance of hydrodynamic interactions between diffusing molecules and nanometric obstacles. Importantly, we found that the effective cytoplasmic diffusivity was not dependent on specific intracellular regions but rather on the local intracellular obstacle volume fraction. Finally, the model was extended to predict the diffusivity of larger macromolecules, showing excellent agreement with literature data for several macromolecules and cell lines.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is particularly adapted to sparse imaging owing to the scanning nature of the method, scan patterns can be designed where fewer sample locations are targeted. However, since some of the pixels are not scanned, there is an inherent loss of information. Several algorithms were developed to reconstruct missing pixels with high fidelity. Whereas sparse imaging and missing pixel reconstruction in 2D experiments are mature methods, the application of sparse imaging in 3D scanning transmission electron tomography (STET) is rare and still under development. The main difficulty encountered in tomography studies is the tilt-series alignment, which must be accurate to ensure high-quality 3D reconstruction. Because sparse images contain only a certain portion of the original information, the images constituting sparse tilt-series might not share enough mutual information to guarantee an accurate alignment, even after missing pixel reconstruction. This work presents for the first time a thorough analysis of the fiducial alignment and reconstruction of sparse (cryo-)STET tilt-series. Furthermore, the limits of sparse imaging are explored to estimate the minimum amount of information required to obtain good-quality 3D reconstructions.

During tumorigenesis, these processes undergo significant alterations in response to oncogenic transformations and microenvironmental pressures. However, a comprehensive systems-level characterization of transportome alterations across cancer types has been lacking. Here, we integrate structural, functional, and mechanistic annotations of all known human Ion Channels and Transporters (ICTs) into a curated database, organizing them into biologically coherent gene sets based on shared physiological and biophysical properties such as permeant species, gating mechanism, and transport directionality. By leveraging Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) across transcriptomic profiles from 19 tumor types, we reveal a recurrent downregulation of ICTs-particularly ion channels-accompanied by selective upregulation of specific pump classes. Our findings uncover a conserved signature of transportome reprogramming in cancer and provide a quantitative framework for future integrative studies of ICT function.

Liposomal encapsulation offers a promising strategy to enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of iron supplements. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered liposomal iron bisglycinate hydrochloride (LIBH), compared to free iron bisglycinate hydrochloride (FIBH), in restoring serum iron levels in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced anemia of inflammation (LIAI). Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal LPS (5 mg/kg) to induce LIAI and were simultaneously treated with either FIBH or LIBH (1 mg/kg, oral). Liposomes (150 - 200 nm) exhibited high encapsulation efficiency (93%) and stability (-38 to -45 mV zeta potential). Serum iron levels were measured 24 hours post-treatment. Results: LPS administration significantly reduced serum iron levels. LIBH restored serum iron levels by 35 - 65% compared to baseline (p < 0.005), outperforming FIBH (0 - 16%, p = NS). Electron microscopy confirmed the structural integrity of LIBH liposomes. Conclusion: LIBH supplementation significantly improves serum iron levels in LIAI and may represent a superior alternative to traditional free iron therapy, particularly in inflammatory conditions. Further studies are warranted to assess its efficacy in other models of anemia.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Advanced Coupled Matrix and Tensor Factorization (ACMTF) has emerged as a powerful framework for uncovering common, local, and distinct sources of variation across datasets. However, ACMTF lacks the ability to model variation linked to a dependent variable, limiting its applicability to studies investigating biological phenotypes. N-way Partial Least Squares (NPLS) is a supervised method that identifies variation in relation to a dependent variable but lacks the ability to identify common, local and distinct sources of variation across multiple datasets. To bridge the gap between data exploration and prediction, we introduce ACMTF-Regression (ACMTF-R), an extension of ACMTF that incorporates a regression term, allowing for the simultaneous decomposition of multi-way data while explicitly capturing variation associated with an outcome variable. We present a detailed mathematical formulation of ACMTF-R, including its optimisation algorithm and implementation. Through extensive simulations, we systematically evaluate its ability to recover a small y-related component shared between multiple blocks, its robustness to noise, and the impact of the tuning parameter ({pi}) which controls the balance between data exploration and outcome prediction. Our results demonstrate that ACMTF-R can robustly identify the y-related component, correctly identifying outcome-associated shared and distinct variation, distinguishing it from existing approaches such as N-way Partial Least Squares and ACMTF. To validate its applicability in a real-world setting, we apply ACMTF-R to a multi-omics dataset integrating human milk microbiome, human milk metabolome, and infant faecal microbiome data, investigating how maternal pre-pregnancy BMI affects microbial and metabolic signatures. ACMTF-R successfully identifies novel mother-infant relationships associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, underscoring its utility in multi-omics research.

AMBRA1 is a scaffold factor that interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4-DDB1 complex to regulate the stability of cyclin D-type proteins, key regulators of the G1-S phase transition. However, how cells complete S-phase and coordinate the speed of DNA synthesis is still to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that AMBRA1 affects the turnover of p21Waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1, by coupling the CRL4-DDB1 complex directly to these proteins. In the absence of AMBRA1, the increased stability of p21Waf1/Cip1, rather than p27Kip1, resulted in the accumulation of replication stress by leaving under-replicated DNA during the S phase. We also found that AMBRA1-depleted cells with consequent high p21Waf1/Cip1 are sensitive to the inhibition of lagging-strand DNA synthesis. Of clinical relevance, low levels of AMBRA1 in Sonic-Hedgehog medulloblastoma correlate with a worse prognosis, suggesting that AMBRA1 expression levels could be an informative criterion for patient stratification and treatment.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Cavity-nesting Hymenoptera, including bees and wasps, deliver vital ecolog-ical services but are increasingly vulnerable to urbanisation. In this citizen science-based study, we deployed 286 trap nests across Leipzig and Hamburg (Germany) to investigate how urbanisation and landscape-scale environmental features influence the diversity, community composition, reproductive success, offspring survival and demographic status of these insects. Using Bayesian hierarchical and phylogenetically informed modelling, we found that urbani-sation significantly reduced species richness, reproductive output and offspring survival in both guilds, despite stable nesting activity, suggesting potential ecological trap effects. For bees, urbanisation also reduced the probability of nests functioning as demographic sources. Environmental drivers shaped responses in taxon-specific ways: bee richness and survival in-creased with landscape diversity but declined with fragmentation, while wasp richness and nesting declined with higher temperatures, though survival increased with more green cover. Bee nests were more likely to serve as demographic sources in higher temperatures. Communi-ty composition responses also diverged; bee communities shifted via increased species turno-ver, while wasp assemblages remained relatively stable. Temperature was a major driver of compositional dissimilarity in both groups, whereas landscape diversity was associated with homogenisation in bees and diversification in wasps.

Knockout of H1.3 induced specific changes in gene expression profiles and chromatin dynamics, characterized by the relocalization of H1.2, which was redistributed from its usual chromatin regions to the freed H1.3 regions. Consequently, locus-specific chromatin alterations associated with interferon-related signalling pathways and cell cycle deregulation were observed.

We combine Oxford Nanopore direct RNA-sequencing reads from both native RNAs and in-vitro transcribed controls to identify a robust set of m6A sites supported by multiple tools, which we validate using an orthogonal chemical-profiling assay. We further show that the modification rates at many of these sites are reduced upon knockdown or inhibition of components of the m6A writer-complex, indicating their dependence on the host methyltransferase machinery. We also uncover a cluster of m6A marks upstream of the E6*I splice donor, which were strongly enriched in unspliced transcripts, implicating m6A in regulation of E6 intron retention.

Here we present an integrated experimental and computational investigation into the features that govern uORF-mediated translation control. Using high-resolution proteomics data from 29 healthy human tissues and machine learning-based simulations, we have systematically dissected how features including uORF length, amino acid composition, start codon position, stop codon position, and Kozak context influence repressive activity, and performed experimental validation using reporter gene constructs. We also investigated how multiple uORFs within a single 5' UTR can interact in synergistic or antagonistic ways, with the potential to produce counterintuitive effects on pORF translation. From these studies, we present a model of uORF function, suggesting a hierarchy of uORF feature importance, and proposing that a combination of uORF translation initiation probability, ribosome recycling rate, intercistronic ternary complex recharging requirements, and ribosome stalling mechanisms underlie uORF repressive activity. Together, these studies provide a comprehensive view of the molecular logic underlying uORF activity, offering new insights into their endogenous and highlighting their potential as targets for drug development.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Overexpressed, oncogenic MYC amplifies the flux through most major processes but does not specify a unique carcinogenic pathway. This \"amplifier\" model suggests that MYC must exceed an expression threshold to become oncogenic. We designed a genetic test of this model, using the mouse Trp53 null mutant (p53KO) as a highly robust tumor generator to examine the effect of a modest change in the endogenous Myc level (Myc+/-). Strikingly, tumor-free survival is greatly extended in p53KO mice with haploid Myc gene-dosage, yet in the tumors that do develop (mainly hemangiosarcomas and thymic lymphomas), their Myc deficit has been invariably compensated either by increasing Myc genomic dosage (hemangiosarcomas) or expression (lymphomas). Furthermore, acutely halving the endogenous Myc gene-dosage in established tumor allografts curtails growth rates. These results indicate that even an incremental reduction of MYC activity can be salutary in cancer and that one of the major tumor suppressor functions of p53 derives from its ability to prevent MYC overexpression. Myc generates acute DNA damage by several mechanisms and accordingly, the p53 anti-Myc function may be inextricably linked to its role in genome integrity surveillance.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

This makes hBM-MSCs an enticing therapeutic candidate for inflammatory diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The ARDS microenvironment is complex and contains an abundance of free fatty-acids (FFAs); which are known to differentially impact MSC functionality. PPAR{beta}/{delta} is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear receptor that is activated in response to FFA-binding. It has shown to impact the therapeutic efficacy of mouse MSCs. Objective: This study sought to investigate the impact of PPAR{beta}/{delta}-modulation on MSC functionality in vitro and in vivo. Methods: hBM-MSCs were exposed to a synthetic PPAR{beta}/{delta} agonist/antagonist in the presence or absence of ARDS patient serum and the immunomodulatory and pro-reparative capacity of the MSC secretome was investigated using in vitro assays, and a pre-clinical model of LPS-induced acute lung inflammation (ALI). Results: Our results highlighted that the secretome from PPAR{beta}/{delta}-agonised hBM-MSCs had enhanced pro-reparative capacity in CALU-3 lung epithelial cells by promoting the secretion of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4). This PPAR{beta}/{delta}-induced ANGPTL4-high MSC secretome also showed enhanced cytoprotection, wound repair, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice in a pre-clinical model of ALI.

While therapeutic approaches targeting the disease-causing abnormal protein, progerin, have been developed, further efforts to explore mechanistically distinct and complementary strategies are still critical to better treatment regimens. We previously showed that lentiviral vector-driven expression of {Delta}133p53, a natural inhibitory isoform of p53, rescued HGPS patients-derived fibroblasts from early entry into cellular senescence, which is a downstream event of progerin-induced DNA damage. We also performed a quantitative high-throughput screen (qHTS) of approved drug and investigational agent libraries, leading to the identification of celastrol and AZD1981 as compounds that upregulate {Delta}133p53 protein levels. Methods: To investigate whether celastrol and ADZ1981 upregulate endogenous {Delta}133p53 in HGPS-derived fibroblasts and reduce their senescence-associated phenotypes, we performed western blot assays ({Delta}133p53, progerin, and p21WAF1, which mediates p53-induced senescence and is inhibited by {Delta}133p53), senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase (SA-{beta}-gal) staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IL-6, which is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted from senescent cells), and qRT-PCR assays (p21WAF1 and IL-6). Results: Treatment with celastrol (0.1 M for 24 h) or AZD1981 (10 M for 24 h) reproducibly increased {Delta}133p53 expression and decreased p21WAF1 expression in two strains of fibroblasts derived from HGPS patients. These compounds reduced the percentage of SA-{beta}-gal-positive senescent cells and the secretion of IL-6 into culture medium in both of these fibroblast strains, irrespective of their different basal levels of senescence and IL-6 secretion. These compounds had no effect on the level of progerin. Conclusion: Celastrol and ADZ1981 upregulate endogenous {Delta}133p53 and, reproducing the effects of its vector-driven expression, inhibit cellular senescence and IL-6 secretion in HGPS-derived fibroblasts.

The increased popularity of the Element Bioscience AVITI platform, partially due to the high sequencing accuracy and low cost of reagents, is becoming a viable alternative approach for generating massive amounts of comparative sequencing data across diverse organismal lineages. Using a data set of five accessions from the monocot genus Costus, we tested miniaturization conditions for generating robust, cost-effective libraries and made comparisons of data generated by AVITI and Illumina sequencing platforms to investigate the potential for combining data for population genomic and phylogenomic analyses. Our results show that the AVITI and Illumina data sets are highly congruent in terms of inferring overlapping SNPs, with only a small fraction picked up by only one of the two platforms. The rates of duplication in miniaturized libraries were much higher than in full volume libraries and in the Illumina libraries, resulting in missing SNPs and less sequence coverage when volumes are reduced. For all generated libraries, most downstream evolutionary analyses, including clustering algorithms (such as PCA) and phylogenetic inference, yielded similar results. However, Structure analyses were less consistent across datasets, with data from the most miniaturized libraries being assigned to the wrong clusters. The AVITI platform should be seen as a cost-effective approach for generating genomic data for comparison across taxonomic lineages, even for ongoing projects where Illumina data already exists.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Junipers (Juniperus) are foundational tree species in many semi-arid landscapes of western North America and often hybridize in zones of secondary contact. Such hybridization can be ecologically significant in foundational tree species, due to the strong genetic control and ecological consequences of plant chemistry. We generated genetic and phytochemical data to analyze hybridization among Juniperus grandis, J. occidentalis, and J. osteosperma in western Nevada and its impact on plant chemistry. We used population genomic data (9,125 SNPs; 326 individuals; 25 populations) to quantify patterns of genetic variation across populations and species and characterize ancestry variation in hybrids. While populations within species showed little genetic differentiation, the parental species formed distinct, monophyletic lineages with clear phenotypic and ecological differences. Hybrids occupied intermediate environments, contained ancestry from all three parents, and were mainly F1 or backcross hybrids. Phytochemical data (GC-MS; 163 terpenoid compounds) were likewise analyzed to understand the consequences of hybridization for plant chemistry. The parental species and hybrids displayed distinct phytochemical profiles, with hybrids often characterized by a combination of transgressive and intermediate chemical concentrations. Our results illustrate that geography and environment shape hybrid ancestry for a syngameon involving three Juniperus species, and that admixture generates novel phytochemical variation likely to have ecological consequences.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Although oak species are major contributors to isoprene emission, there is considerable variation in isoprene emission capacity within the Fagaceae family. To unravel the evolutionary origins of isoprene emission, we investigated the molecular evolution of terpene synthase (TPS) genes across eight species from four genera within the Fagaceae. We identified a Fagaceae-specific TPS-b subclade in which potential isoprene synthase (IspS) activity evolved independently in two gene lineages within subgenus Quercus. Seasonal gene expression patterns showed that one lineage exhibited high expression particularly in summer, whereas the other displayed consistently low expression across all seasons. Ancestral sequence reconstruction revealed that the acquisition of a diagnostic amino acid residue for IspS function (a substitution from Thr338 to Phe338) arose convergently in these lineages and was subject to positive selection, suggesting adaptive evolution. Ancestral-enzyme assays targeting the gene lineage with high gene expression revealed that the early protein primarily produced monoterpenes--particularly trans-{beta}-ocimene--from geranyl diphosphate (GPP), whereas their descendants shifted substrate preference to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), evolving into dedicated isoprene synthases. Our results indicate that IspS activity was not ancestral in Fagaceae, but evolved approximately 56 million years ago within the subgenus Quercus, and has been retained ever since. These findings emphasize the roles of enzyme structural innovation and regulatory shifts in the diversification of volatile terpenoid biosynthesis.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate the regulatory functions of TEs in mouse liver tissue following early-life exposure to environmental toxicants, including arsenic (As), lead (Pb), bisphenol A (BPA), tributyltin (TBT), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5). These toxicants are linked to various health issues, including neurodevelopmental deficits, metabolic and immune dysfunction, and increased cancer risks. Integrative analysis of 351 multi-omics datasets from liver tissues of 5-month-old mice indicated that early-life environmental exposures significantly altered chromatin accessibility and expression of TEs in later life stage, revealing distinct exposure-specific signatures and sex-dependent responses. 6,699 TEs were identified with altered chromatin accessibility, mostly in non-coding regions, suggesting potential impact on gene regulation. Within these TEs, LINE elements were enriched in genes involved in metabolic pathways, while LTR elements, particularly the ORR1E subfamily, were predominantly associated with immune-related genes. Additionally, we identified 140 TE-gene chimeric transcripts with TE-derived novel transcription start sites, highlighting TE-contributed transcriptional plasticity.

Because the genetic basis of all traits in flowering dogwood is unknown, combining them using traditional breeding efforts is time, labor, and space-intensive. We developed foundational genomic resources to establish marker-assisted selection within flowering dogwood breeding. We generated diploid, chromosome-scale, annotated genome assemblies for one pink-bracted and red-leafed tree and one white-bracted and green-leafed tree. Additionally, a phenotyping protocol for bract color and presence/absence diagnostic SNPs for bract and leaf color were established. We leveraged these resources to evaluate linkage associations and differential gene expression related to anthocyanin biosynthesis to identify candidate genes regulating bract and leaf pigmentation. Within a 14Mb locus we identified 14 anthocyanin-related candidate genes. Two genes, with MYB (g19533) and RING finger (g19556) binding domains, had both differential gene expression and variants with the expected segregation pattern.

To investigate the early functional consequences of TDP-43 mislocalization, we generated Caenorhabditis elegans models expressing either wild-type human TDP-43 or a variant with a mutated nuclear localization signal ({Delta}NLS), specifically in serotonergic neurons. These neurons were chosen because i) serotonin deficits are a feature of ALS/FTD and ii) in C. elegans, they regulate well-characterized behaviors, providing a straightforward readout of neuronal function. We found that expression of either TDP-43 variant impaired serotonin-dependent behaviors, including pharyngeal pumping, egg-laying, and locomotion slowing upon food encounter, with the cytoplasmic {Delta}NLS form causing more severe deficits. Serotonergic neurons remained i) morphologically intact, indicating that neuronal dysfunction precedes overt neurodegeneration; and ii) partially responsive to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, suggesting that neurotransmitter release is still partially functional. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that cytoplasmic TDP-43 disrupts neuronal signaling and behavior early in disease progression.

This is particularly relevant for modern spectral flow cytometers, which can simultaneously measure an increasingly large number of antibody marker channels. While dimensionality reduction provides for more efficient data processing, this comes at the expense of data loss that may miss subtle patterns among rare cell types that may be critical for disease detection. Maintaining analysis at full dimensions presents opportunities to preserve resolution and provides complete downstream data interpretability. However, a significant obstacle to analysis of cytometry data without dimensionality reduction is the significant batch effects observed in this data between experiment days, operators and equipment types. Here we show a new strategy to denoise batch variation from both flow- and mass-cytometry datasets using an autoencoder neural network architecture. We generated a benchmark flow cytometry dataset in mice to compare this approach to current toolsets and find our approach shows superior preservation of biological signals, whilst also performing batch correction equal to current best methodology. Our batch alignment approach works to such an extent that it becomes practically possible to project batch aligned data into multidimensional space to generate a novel representation of cellular phenotype for downstream model building. This hyperdimensional approach maintains original data resolution without requiring dimensionality reduction, and thus any resultant cell populations that differentiate phenotypes remain fully interpretable. We show with two large clinical datasets that our batch-alignment approach coupled with the multi-dimensional representation successfully detects meaningful patterns in cases where the original analysis methods struggled. This new framework removes some of the inherent technical limitations encountered in the integration of large, multi-batch cytometry datasets and provides a framework for machine learning model building from this modality.

Here we show that in cell culture, H5N1 induced more rapid and extensive cell death than H1N1. Since Interferon (IFN) signaling is key to innate immunity, we examined its role in virus-induced cell death using STAT1-knockout A549 cells and JAK/STAT pathway inhibitors like Baricitinib. Both approaches reduced cell death across various IAV strains, including H1N1, H5N1, H7N9, and H3N2. However, inhibition increased viral titers, raising concerns about its clinical use in isolation.

To address these gaps, we presented EvoScape, a deep learning model designed to predict viral immune escape and evolution by integrating evolutionary context with protein structure, capturing residue-residue dependence, and introducing a novel top-K L2-differential pooling mechanism to prioritize mutations with large functional impacts. We demonstrated that EvoScape significantly outperformed state-of-the-art models on the most comprehensive benchmark to date, comprising eleven deep mutational scanning experiments spanning diverse viruses. Furthermore, EvoScape exhibited outstanding performance in the practical applications of identifying immune escape hotspots and forecasting circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.

In the search for efficient and promising organisms in mycoremediation, the marine yeast Debaryomyces hansenii has emerged as a compelling candidate, due to its ability to thrive under a variety of stressful conditions. This study presents the first integrated molecular and biochemical characterization of BaP degradation in a marine yeast, providing mechanistic insights into the detoxification and antioxidant responses involved. In this study, we explored D. hansenii's capacity to degrade BaP and characterized the associated molecular and biochemical responses induced by this compound. Our findings demonstrate that D. hansenii can tolerate BaP concentrations up to 100 ppm without compromising cell viability and is capable of degrading nearly 70% of the compound within six days. The degradation process appears to be enzymatically mediated, primarily involving cytochrome P450 (CYP), epoxide hydrolase (EH), and glutathione S-transferase (GST), enzymes typically associated with xenobiotic metabolism, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. BaP exposure resulted in pronounced oxidative stress, evidenced by elevated ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation. However, D. hansenii activated a robust antioxidant defense, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and regulation of the glutathione redox system. Altogether, our data unveil a tightly coordinated cellular strategy that combines oxidation, conjugation, and detoxification pathways to counteract BaP-induced toxicity and sustain redox homeostasis.

LPS and nigericin robustly activated this inflammasome in macrophages, as expected, but not in OCs.

In vivo studies demonstrated that under the conditions where OCs efficiently release Ca2+ from bone, inflammasome formation was enhanced.

The use of a cNXR by NOB has been reported to be linked to a lower nitrite affinity and energy efficiency of nitrite oxidation, indicating adaptation to nitrogen-rich environments. In this study, cNXR NOB model strains demonstrated nitrite concentration-dependent shifts in optimal growth pH, a behavior not observed in pNXR NOB. Nitrobacter winogradskyi Nb-255 (cNXR NOB), grown at 1 mM nitrite (pH 7.5), exhibited a high nitrite affinity in terms of apparent Km (25.9 M) and a high specific affinity ao (440.5 l g cells-1 h-1), both comparable to pNXR NOB in microrespirometry-based kinetic assays. Unexpectedly, cells pre-grown at 10 mM nitrite (pH 7.5) achieved a pNXR-like affinity at pH 5.5 without prior adaptation to acidic conditions. In contrast, pNXR NOB exhibited consistent kinetic behavior across different pH conditions. Kinetic inhibition in the presence of nitrate suggested that this plasticity is driven by a regulated interplay between nitrite uniport and nitrite/nitrate antiporter systems. Our findings indicate that Nitrobacter can dynamically modulate nitrite affinity in response to both nitrite concentration and pH, conferring a flexible adaptation strategy that features traits of both r- and K-strategists across a range of environmental conditions.

This ex vivo study included specimens from 23 participants who received oral cannabidiol (up to 5 mg/kg twice daily) for 11 days. Lymphocytes were isolated and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies, with or without tacrolimus. Pharmacodynamic responses were assessed via CellTiter-Glo proliferation, scRNA-seq, cytokine assays, and flow cytometry. Steady-state plasma concentrations of CBD were quantified via tandem mass spectrometry. We identified an increased proportion of T effector memory (TEM) cells post-cannabidiol (22% increase, P-value of 3.2 x 10-32), which correlated with CBD plasma concentrations (Pearson Corr= 0.77, P-value < 0.01). Post-cannabidiol cytokine assays revealed elevated proinflammatory IL-6 protein levels and anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels (adjusted P-values < 0.0001). Cannabidiol reduced overall T and B lymphocyte proliferation with additive immunosuppressive effects to tacrolimus. In flow cytometry, the proportion of TEM and TEMRA increased post-cannabidiol with tacrolimus (P-values < 0.05). Cannabidiol exhibits mixed immunomodulatory effects with pro- and anti-inflammatory signals. Understanding the clinical safety of cannabidiol use is important given the paucity of pain control options available for immunocompromised transplant populations.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) is an emerging regulatory module that contributes to these expression patterns wherein a specialized RNA (TDMD trigger) drives miRNA decay through base pairing and resulting recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase ZSWIM8/EBAX-1. Extensive base pairing to the miRNA seed region and 3' end has been proposed as a key feature that distinguishes TDMD triggers from conventional mRNA targets of miRNAs, which primarily pair with the seed. Here we identify the long noncoding RNA, tts-2, as a TDMD trigger for mir-35-42, the most abundant miRNA family in C. elegans early embryos. We demonstrate that a single site in tts-2 drives decay through base pairing with the seed sequence shared by all eight family members. A second site in tts-2 supports decay of mir-38 with incomplete seed complementarity. Our findings demonstrate that extended base pairing is not a universal requirement for TDMD, and that TDMD drives developmentally-timed clearance of abundant miRNAs at the exit of C. elegans embryogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Methods: Primary mammary epithelial cells isolated from goat mammary gland, luminal epithelial cells isolated from goat milk and mouse mammary epithelial cells were cultured and treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) to induce oxidative stress. Cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme activity were measured to assess the oxidative status of cells. CypA gene expression was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the secreted CypA levels were measured by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. Milk samples from various cow breeds were also analysed for somatic cell count, catalase activity and CypA levels. Results: The primary mammary epithelial cells culture displayed typical epithelial cell morphology. Oxidative stress induced by 200 [mu]M of both H2O2 and t-BHP and an exposure duration of 1 hour was observed to be optimum in inducing oxidative stress. A significant increase in ROS levels and lipid peroxidation index was observed across all cell types. Catalase activity was also elevated in the treated cells. An upregulation of CypA gene expression was observed in response to oxidative stress with a significant increase in CypA protein levels. Milk samples from the various cattle breeds revealed varying somatic cell counts with the highest in Kankrej and lowest in Holstein Friesian. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that CypA is secreted from the mammary epithelial cells in response to oxidative stress and may serve as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress in dairy cows.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Y.; Cappadocia, L.; Lussier, M.", "abstract": "The endolysosomal system is a dynamic intracellular network essential for cargo degradation, recycling and spatial compartmentalization. Precise coordination of endosome maturation and positioning is critical for maintaining lysosomal function and regulating receptor fate. This study uncovers a novel role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF13 in controlling endolysosomal dynamics through its interaction with the small GTPase Arl8B. Using predictive structural modeling and co-immunoprecipitation assays, the results demonstrate that RNF13 binds to Arl8B, implicating residues Glu22 and Phe55 of Arl8B with RNF13 Leu244. Their interaction influences lysosomal positioning and the trafficking of endocytic cargo. Notably, loss of RNF13-Arl8B binding alters Arl8B localization and causes a peripheral redistribution of lysosomes, while not affecting the abundance of endolysosomal markers. However, it does impair the internalization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). These findings suggest that the RNF13-Arl8B interaction plays a crucial role in modulating vesicle maturation and fusion. Furthermore, overexpression of the Arl8B effector PLEKHM1 enhances RNF13-Arl8B complex formation, indicating a possible cooperative assembly of tethering complexes during lysosome and endosome fusion. Together, the results identify RNF13 as a spatial regulator of lysosomal organization and cargo processing, operating through a non-enzymatic scaffolding mechanism. This reveals an additional layer of regulation in endolysosomal trafficking, supporting a role for RNF13 as a checkpoint in cargo progression through degradative pathways. Altogether, the results of this work expand the understanding of the molecular coordination underlying lysosomal dynamics and underscore the importance of selective effector interactions in coordinating endolysosomal trafficking.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we reveal how Drosophila melanogaster acquired PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA)-mediated immunity against the recently invading endogenous retrovirus tirant. By integrating genetics, small RNA profiling, and population genomics, we identify two distinct modes of de novo piRNA biogenesis. The primary mechanism involves antisense insertions into the flamenco cluster, a well-established master locus for transposon control. Strikingly, we also find that antisense tirant insertions into 3' UTRs of host genes robustly trigger piRNA production, a process driven by host gene transcription but independent of gene identity. These findings challenge prevailing models that link piRNA precursor specification to genomic origin or nuclear processing context. Instead, they uncover a flexible, general mechanism in which transposition into host gene exons represents a critical vulnerability for transposons: by generating chimeric antisense transcripts that are exported to the cytoplasm, transposons inadvertently initiate their own silencing, enabling rapid and adaptive genome defense against new invaders.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Typically, these viruses are monitored using clinical samples from patients seeking medical attention. Recently, wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) has been leveraged to understand transmission dynamics and genome evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal respiratory viruses.

Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we found that acute methamphetamine exposure leads to a marked up-regulation of cholesterol metabolism genes in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra-a response that was much less pronounced in astrocytes and largely absent in other cell types. Further analysis using a ribosome tagging strategy combined with RNA sequencing revealed that amphetamine, a structurally similar psychostimulant, induced similar gene expression changes, whereas methylphenidate, a structurally distinct psychostimulant, did not, highlighting drug-specific transcriptional responses. Notably, repeated methamphetamine exposure resulted in down-regulation of cholesterol metabolism genes in dopaminergic neurons. Interestingly, we also observed that, compared to neighboring cell types, dopaminergic neurons are highly enriched in genes encoding cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes, including the rate-limiting enzyme Hmgcr, and key regulators Srebf2 and Insig1, challenging the prevailing view that neurons rely mainly on astrocyte-derived cholesterol.

Employing advanced microscopy, including fluorescence lifetime imaging, we investigated condensate aging and aggregation mechanisms of the prion-like domain of hnRNPA1 (A1PrD), a ribonucleoprotein implicated in both disorders. Using a simplified system across various salt and RNA conditions, we demonstrate that homotypic and heterotypic interactions between A1PrD and RNA significantly influence aggregate morphology and amyloid fibril formation, yielding diverse structures including thin fibrils, solid gels, and filamentous starburst aggregates. By tracking aggregate morphogenesis, we observed shifts in fluorescence lifetimes that reflect differences in condensate microenvironments, highlighting distinct homotypic and heterotypic interaction dynamics. Our findings indicate that amyloid fibril formation can initiate within fluid condensates or at the interfaces of solid gels. Moreover, early amyloid-rich fluid starbursts demonstrated the capability to fuse with or recruit younger amyloid-poor droplets, exemplifying prion-like infectivity and accelerating fibril formation.

These components act synergistically, bestowing the rheological and tribological material properties essential to cartilage function. At the onset of osteoarthritis, a disease characterized by cartilage degeneration, GAGs diminish from the ECM reducing interstitial fluid load support (IFLS) and transferring load to the collagen fibril network, which subsequently breaks down, culminating in increased hydraulic permeability, and decreased cartilage stiffness. We restore the material properties of damaged cartilage critical to diarthrodial joint function by forming an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) with the native collagen using a synthetic, hydrophilic, and biocompatible GAG-mimetic polymer. Upon visible light activation, the monomer, 3-sulfopropylmethacrylate (SPM), and the crosslinker, polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), form a sulfonated and anionic IPN that entangles and fills the existing porous degraded collagen matrix. Mechanistically, the highly sulfated, anionic SPM IPN retards water transport, reestablishes collagen fibril network integrity, and restores tissue IFLS, thereby returning the stiffness and viscoelastic properties of degraded cartilage to healthy levels. Additionally, the SPM IPN protects cartilage from further degradation by reducing the infiltration of inflammatory cytokines that upregulate catabolic matrix metalloproteinases and downregulate GAG production.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

While past studies have focused on sagittal-plane slip mechanics, the mechanisms of inducing frontal-plane trunk excursion remain poorly understood. This study investigated which slip foot kinematic variables predict lateral trunk flexion during unexpected slips. Twenty-six healthy young adults experienced an unexpected slip while walking in a laboratory setting. Peak anteroposterior (AP) heel slip distance, velocity, and acceleration, as well as mediolateral (ML) slip distance, velocity, and acceleration, were measured using three-dimensional motion capture. A stepwise multiple linear regression identified peak AP heel slip acceleration as the sole significant predictor of lateral trunk flexion (p = .026, R2 = 0.19). One-way repeated measures ANOVA and one-tailed paired t-tests further revealed that peak heel acceleration occurred significantly earlier than both peak heel velocity (p = .012) and the onset of lateral trunk flexion (p < .001), supporting its role as an early destabilizing mechanism. In contrast, neither velocity nor slip distance predicted lateral trunk flexion magnitude. These findings suggest that peak AP heel acceleration is associated with inducing lateral trunk flexion movements that likely precede lateral falls. Reducing heel acceleration through slip-resistant flooring or footwear, or enhancing compensatory strategies such as reactive arm movements, may reduce the likelihood of losing sideways balance.

Typically, researchers generate hypotheses by carefully analyzing available information and making logical connections, which are then tested. The accelerating growth of biomedical literature makes it increasingly difficult to keep pace with connections between biological entities emerging across biomedical research. Recently developed automated means of generating hypotheses can generate many more hypotheses than can be easily tested. One such approach involves literature-based discovery (LBD) systems such as Serial KinderMiner (SKiM), which surfaces putative A-B-C links derived from term co-occurrence. However, LBD systems leave three critical gaps: (i) they find statistical associations, not biological relationships; (ii) they can produce false-positive leads; and (iii) they do not assess agreement with a hypothesis in question. As a result, LBD search results often require costly manual curation to be of practical utility to the researcher. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to automate much of this curation step, but standalone LLMs are hampered by hallucinations, lack of transparency in information sources, and the inability to reference data not included in the training corpus. Results We introduce SKiM-GPT, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines SKiM's co-occurrence search and retrieval with frontier LLMs to evaluate user-defined hypotheses. For every chosen A-B-C SKiM hit, SKiM-GPT retrieves appropriate PubMed abstract texts, filters out irrelevant abstracts with a fine-tuned relevance model, and prompts an LLM to evaluate the user's hypothesis, given the relevant abstracts. Importantly, the SKiM-GPT system is transparent and human-verifiable: it displays the retrieved abstracts, the hypothesis score, and a justification for the score grounded in the texts and written in natural language. On a benchmark consisting of 14 disease-gene-drug hypotheses, SKiM-GPT achieves strong ordinal agreement with four expert biologists (Cohen's {kappa} = 0.84), demonstrating SKiM-GPT's ability to replicate expert judgment.

Moreover, protein databases contain many proteins of unknown function. Owing to this gap between known proteins and enzymatic reactions, various proteins of unknown function may be orphan enzymes; however, available tools cannot adequately predict these links. In this study, we developed DeepRES, an AI-based framework for comprehensive enzyme screening, to explore novel enzyme candidates from proteins of unknown function for reactions of interest. DeepRES implements enzyme screening via two steps: classification of enzymes and non-enzymes and prediction of catalytic capabilities for enzyme-reaction pairs. The two deep learning models comprising DeepRES showed comparable or superior performance to that of existing software. We performed screening of 1,255 orphan enzymes involved in the microbiome using DeepRES and successfully identified candidate proteins for 897 orphan enzymes. We then used those candidates as references for genomic analysis and explored novel biosynthetic gene clusters from microbial genomes to obtain promising candidate gene clusters, including those related to anthocyanin degradation.

Here, we describe a new \"detailed\" mass offset (DMO) search implemented in the MSFragger search engine, which allows each mass offset to have its own site restrictions and fragmentation rules. The benefits of DMO search over existing mass offset searches are shown with three example searches of complex modification sets: nearly one hundred post-translational modifications, fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP)-derived modifications, and amino acid substitutions. The DMO search further improves the interpretability of results by reducing ambiguity in site localization, particularly when modifications have overlapping masses, and provides benefits that scale with the complexity of the search.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Despite this important sex-bias in sepsis outcomes, little is known about its mechanistic drivers nor therapeutic implications, as much of the foundational data on sepsis pathogenesis is derived from animal studies that included only male subjects, potentially contributing to the notable paucity of successful mouse-to-human translation of sepsis therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrate that male-biased illness severity and organ dysfunction in mouse models of bacterial sepsis is mediated by impaired disease tolerance in males, involving impaired tolerogenic shifts in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism compared to females. Microbiological analyses and systems immunology characterization of sepsis between males and females revealed that sex-biased disease tolerance was independent of infection resistance mechanisms, as well as canonical immune/inflammatory dysregulation. Therapeutic potentiation of mitochondrial tolerance with doxycycline neutralized sexual dimorphism of illness severity and organ dysfunction through a male-predominant treatment effect. These data reveal that biological sex is a fundamental determinant of illness severity and treatment-responsiveness in sepsis through modulation of disease tolerance, which may be harnessed therapeutically to address sex-biased outcomes in sepsis.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Exposure to eliglustat, a therapeutic inhibitor of glucosylceramide biosynthesis, suppressed hepatic disease and occurrence of monoclonal immunoglobulins.

B.; Sahu, A. P.; Serpa, R. O.; Neely, E. B.; Elcheva, I. A.; Spiegelman, V. S.; Connor, J.", "abstract": "Introduction: Brain inflammation leads to an increase in the amount of iron in brain tissue; however, studies do not address the source of the iron that could lead to the accumulation. Most of the brain iron uptake is mediated through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), but studies have not examined whether inflammation increases or decreases iron flux across the BBB. Our recent in vitro study discovered a novel alternate mechanism that iron transport across the BBB is mediated via the extracellular vesicles (EVs). Herein, we investigated the impact of brain inflammation on iron release and iron transport via EVs from the brain microvasculature (BMV). Methods: For this study, we developed an in vivo brain inflammation model. We induced brain inflammation in three-month-old C57BL/6 by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS,12 microgram/mice). For in vitro, we used human blood-brain barrier endothelial cells derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). We separated the BMV from brain parenchyma by using density gradient centrifugation. To inhibit the EVs synthesis, we injected intraperitoneally for 21 days GW4869 (60 microgram/mice), an inhibitor of neutral sphingomyelinase 2, a key regulatory enzyme necessary for EV formation. The brain EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation. We measured the BMV and parenchyma iron concentration by Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Furthermore, we performed immunoblotting to measure the protein expression in BMV and EVs. Results: The LPS injection activated microglia and astrocytes as well as increased the brain proinflammatory cytokines compared to the control mice. Furthermore, brain inflammation increased the iron levels in the brain parenchyma but decreased the iron levels in BMV. Brain inflammation was associated with the degradation of ferroportin (FPN1), an iron exporter, in the BMV. CD63, an EVs membrane protein, was increased in the BMV and associated with increased FTH1-iron release via EVs from BMVs to the brain. Moreover, brain inflammation induced iron deficiency in BMV as evidenced by an increase in the transferrin receptor and decreased FTH1, suggestive of increased iron uptake. Pharmacological reduction of EVs by GW4869 reduced iron accumulation in the inflamed brain parenchyma compared to control mice. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that EV inhibition decreases iron in the brain. Degradation of FPN1 in the BMV during inflammation did not limit iron accumulation but there was an increase in FTH1-iron-enriched EVs indicating these are responsible for brain iron accumulation during inflammation. Thus, in summary, we have discovered a novel mechanism that involves BMV-released EVs enriched with iron that is the mechanism for brain iron accumulation during inflammation.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

This study investigates interbacterial competition between bacteria found in the oral cavity, where Streptococcus species comprise a large portion of the resident oral microbiota and Enterococcus faecalis is a pathobiont that is commonly found in root canal infections. We used co-cultures to determine whether oral Streptococci and E. faecalis compete with each other. Our experiments revealed that multiple strains of Streptococcus mutans, an important cariogenic bacterium, kill vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and other Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Further, inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria by some strains of S. mutans requires the production of the non-ribosomal cyclic lipopeptide mutanobactin, while another strain inhibits independent of mutanobactin. We determined that S. mutans mutanobactin production increases target cell membrane permeability and that killing is contact-dependent. We also determined that an E. faecalis virulence factor, the secreted protease gelatinase (GelE), is required for recovery from mutanobactin-mediated killing. Additionally, data show that S. mutans mutanobactin production prevents and kills E. faecalis biofilms.

Antibiotic activity screening revealed that 16% of isolates inhibited the growth of at least one of E. coli or S. aureus, with 120 isolates displaying activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE). Mass spectrometry-based dereplication using GNPS identified known antibiotics in 33% of bioactive strains, including actinomycin D, nonactins, and valinomycin. Genomic analysis confirmed the presence of corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), while targeted analysis of selected strains uncovered production of additional antibiotics such as nigericin and streptothricin that were not initially detected by mass spectrometry.

While they were initially considered non-biodegradable, different pathways for both, anaerobic and aerobic degradation have been discovered over the last 40 years. Anaerobic reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene (TCE) leads to the formation and possible accumulation of the toxic intermediate products, dichloroethene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). In contrast, aerobic metabolic processes result in mineralization of the contaminants without the formation of stable intermediates. Therefore, productive aerobic degradation processes can have a considerable advantage, depending on site conditions and chloroethene molecule. The potential for aerobic degradation processes can be assessed by molecular biological analysis. In our study, aerobic metabolic TCE enrichment cultures, bioaugmented groundwater, and a microcosm with intrinsic aerobic TCE degradation potential were analyzed. Amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics were used to identify the Rhodocyclaceae bacterial family in all samples, as well as functional gene sequences, which were relatives of monooxygenases and dehalogenases. Based on these sequencing data, qPCR detection methods for TCE assimilating Rhodocyclaceae (Rho) as well as for different functional genes that were associated with monooxygenases (moABC) and haloacid dehalogenases like hydrolases (hdlh) have been established. The specificity of the qPCR methods was demonstrated with a variety of environmental samples and different chloroethene degrading bacterial cultures.

On human timescales, DNA mutation results in the evolution of antibiotic resistance, viral resistance to vaccines, the emergence human cancers, and more. Precise measurement of DNA mutation is therefore desirable to rapidly detect and analyze low frequency mutations in a population of cells. Precise measurement of DNA mutation by high throughput sequencing has been hindered by sequencing error rates, which occur at rates 1x10^-2 to 1x10^-3 per base sequenced. Previous work on circle sequencing had pushed a putative sequencing error rate down to roughly 2.8x10^-4 per base for genomic yeast DNA in the absence of DNA repair enzymes, where the expected number is 4.7x10^-9 per base per generation. Through revision of the assay, we are now capable of taking 125ng of genomic DNA and obtaining mutation rate estimates with a sequencing resolution floor of 2x10^-7 per base in the absence of repair enzymes, a resolution improvement of over 3 orders of magnitude. In practice, circle-seq recovers some of the mutation spectrum of mismatch-repair deficient E. coli, although some signature of C > T and G > A errors remain present. Curiously, it calls a mutation rate of 2x10^-9 per base per generation, lower than expected, underscoring the difficulty of directly comparing mutation rates per base to MA mutation rates per site per generation. This protocol readily recognizes Covaris ultrasonication as mutagenic in library preps, with a mutation spectrum dominated by G:C > A:T, G:C > C:G, and G:C > T:A errors. The protocol is either detecting in vivo DNA damage that has yet to be repaired, is significantly biased in its ability to detect mutations, or is not yet sensitive enough to detect mutation rates of MMR- E. coli cells. The protocol may have some use in measuring mutation abundance from tissue samples, and in vitro sources of DNA damage.

Accumulating pieces of evidence suggest that these chemicals may also pose risks to human and animal health. Objectives. This study investigates the transgenerational effects of thiacloprid (Thia), a neonicotinoid, on the female reproductive system. Methods. Pregnant outbred Swiss female mice were exposed to 0 and 6 mg/kg/day of thiacloprid from embryonic days E6.5 to E15.5. Adult female F1 and F3 progeny ovaries were examined for morphological abnormalities by using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of paraffin sections. Additionally, estradiol levels were assessed by ELISA using blood serum. A marker of mitosis, phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10 (PhosphoHisH3ser10) levels, was analyzed by immunofluorescence, DNA methylation at some regions was analyzed by MeDIP, and RT-qPCR assessed gene expression. Results. The gestational exposure to thiacloprid led to an increased formation of multi-oocyte follicles in directly exposed F1 generation ovaries but not in F3. We observed a reduction in serum estradiol levels in both F1 and F3 females. In direct F1 exposed progeny, we determined an increase in (PhosphoHisH3ser10) in granulosa cells. Additionally, alterations in DNA methylation were observed in germline reprogramming-responsive genes in embryonic ovaries, as well as the DNA methylation was altered at these genes in both the F1 and F3 ovaries. The modified DNA methylation was associated with changes in gene expression in adult ovaries of the F1 and F3 generations in genes encoding transcription and hormonal signaling factors. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that ancestral gestational exposure to thiacloprid induces transgenerational effects on female reproductive health, potentially through epigenetic modifications of paternal germ cells.

To investigate the genetic and evolutionary origins of these differences, we perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping on recombinant hybrids generated from reciprocal crosses between brown and black morphs D. elegans. QTL mapping reveals significant contributions from the X chromosome and Muller element E to intraspecific pigmentation polymorphism, with ebony identified as one candidate gene. Analysis of ebony expression, including allele-specific expression in F1 hybrids, and sequence variation suggests that the intra- and interspecific pigmentation differences within D. elegans species subgroup may have evolved independently from the lineage-specific region upstream of ebony.

However, the question of whether non-cellular reactions analogous to cell respiration metabolism are still ''active'' in today's biosphere and whether they contribute to CO2 emissions in contemporary ecosystems remains open. In the present study, we investigated the long-term fate (> 6 months) of organic substrates supplied in sterilised soils in which cell life was not detectable. Through a series of analytical studies performed on the water-extractable fraction of soil exometabolites using chromatography, mass spectrometry and isotope labelling, we demonstrate that sterile soil matrix incubated with [13C6]-glucose and [13C6]-citrate can spontaneously generate intermediates of the Krebs cycle, alongside by-products such as acetate and formate. These findings support the hypothesis that extracellular metabolisms (EXOMETs) form a network of non-cellular reactions resembling metabolic pathways involved in aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation of cells. This research not only provides insights into the chemical continuity between chemistry and biochemistry but also raises questions about the implications of non-cellular pathways for soil ecosystem functioning and carbon fluxes in the contemporary biosphere.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Using 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis, we observed distinct media-dependent metabolic shifts. Standard M9 exhibited limited bacterial growth and heightened stress-related fermentation, indicated by high ethanol and acetate levels. In contrast, M9+ significantly increased biomass but promoted pronounced overflow metabolism. M9++ presented intermediate biomass levels and markedly reduced overflow metabolites, favoring biosynthesis pathways, notably increasing valine, acetoin, and formate concentrations. These findings suggest that further optimization of glucose concentration, nitrogen sources, and phosphate buffering could significantly improve the metabolic balance of M9++, creating an enhanced medium tailored for efficient, high-quality recombinant protein expression and isotopic labeling in E. coli.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In vision research, there is a notable lack of suitable in vitro systems to study ECM dynamics. To help fill this gap, we developed an easy-to-use, photosensitive poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogel that can deform on demand to simulate ECM bulging, known as drusen, associated with the aging of the outer retina. Our findings demonstrate that variations in the size of these artificial drusen during culture impact morphometric parameters of the retinal pigment epithelium, offering new insights into its mechanical resilience to different drusen sizes. Notably, drusen formation in our system does not significantly affect the cellular actin cytoskeleton or polarity, which are often disrupted in conventional acute substrate deformation models.

L.; Hendricks, A. G.", "abstract": "Tau, a neuronal microtubule-associated protein (MAP), organizes the axonal cytoskeleton and regulates intracellular transport. Tau hyperphosphorylation is closely linked to neurodegeneration in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Tau binds microtubules cooperatively, forming envelopes that restrict access to the microtubule lattice and regulate the activity of motor proteins and other MAPs. However, the effect of disease-related perturbations on tau dynamics and function remains unclear. Using tau phosphomutants in vitro and in live neurons, we show that tau hyperphosphorylation disrupts cooperative binding and dysregulates lysosome transport. Hyperphosphorylated tau does not form envelopes, distributes more uniformly along the axon, and dissociates faster from microtubules. Tau mildly inhibits KIF5C motility, but strongly inhibits KIF1A. Hyperphosphorylation reduces KIF5C inhibition but increases KIF1A inhibition by decreasing processivity and accelerating detachment. Consistent with these effects, hyperphosphorylated tau alters lysosome transport in neurons. While phospho-resistant tau inhibits processive lysosome motility, hyperphosphorylated tau weakens tau-mediated regulation of lysosome transport - mimicking tau knockout neurons that exhibit enhanced processivity. Altogether, hyperphosphorylation disrupts tau envelopes and impairs lysosome trafficking, contributing to defects in degradative pathways that drive neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

The precise mechanism of action of these drugs, however, has been debated, rendering the design of rational combination therapies challenging. Here, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme USP48 as a crucial regulator of posttranslational histone modification in the context of DNA demethylation. USP48 loss selectively enhances response to DNMT1 inhibition, leading to a rapid induction of cell death. We demonstrate that USP48 is localized at sites of DNA damage and deubiquitinates H2A variants and proteins important for DNA damage repair. Functionally, loss of USP48 triggers an increase in chromatin accessibility upon HMA treatment, rendering AML cells more susceptible to DNA damage. Our results support USP48 as a posttranslational histone modifier for chromatin stability and DNA damage in response to HMA-related DNA demethylation.

Herein, we report the structure-guided development of a novel series of triazole-based WDR5 WIN-site inhibitors designed to increase passive brain penetration. We identified triazole-based WDR5 inhibitors that are potent, passively permeable, and in some cases more brain penetrant than other scaffolds. We phenotypically assessed our novel WDR5 inhibitors in a panel of patient-derived CSC models and uncovered unique WDR5-regulated metabolic genes in GBM.

Considering sex differences in the incidence of cardiovascular disease with age, we investigated the effect of GSNOR deletion (-/-) on age-related changes in cardiac function. We performed longitudinal 2D-echocardiography measurements in M-Mode on male and female, wildtype (WT) and GSNOR-/- mice at young (3-4 months), middle (13-15 months) and old age (18-20 months). Left ventricular wall thickness and ejection fraction decreased with age in WT mice but was maintained in GSNOR-/-. Western blot and GSNOR-activity assay showed GSNOR activity and expression decreased with age in WT females alone. Isolated cardiomyocyte force-coupling analysis showed increasing age was inversely correlated with sarcomere shortening and Ca2+ release kinetics in WT males, but not GSNOR-/-. WT females showed slower Ca2+ re-uptake after contraction and time to peak sarcomere shortening, but all other parameters were maintained. GSNOR-/- females exhibited slower Ca2+ re-uptake and decreased sarcomere shortening. Proteomic analysis of SNO from females showed upregulation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase, E1 Beta and Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase in young WT females relative to middle-age mice.

Unlike the canonical soluble nucleo-cytosolic forms, these proteins were predicted to have transmembrane (TM) domains and, apparently, should be localized on some kind of cell membranes. To date, 95 predicted TM-containing phosphotransmitter (TM-HPt) homologs were found in 61 plant species belonging to different clades, taxa and groups: bryophytes, gymnosperms, mono- and dicotyledons. The conserved HPt motif with phosphorylatable histidine was preserved in the most of TM-HPts under study that allowed us to consider these proteins potentially active in MSP signaling. For the found TM-HPts, a Bayesian analysis at the DNA level was performed and a relevant phylogenetic tree was constructed. According to evolutionary relationships, plant TM-HPts were divided into two main groups corresponding to Arabidopsis AHP1-3,5,6 and AHP4 orthologs. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed the expression of the most of the investigated TM-HPt-encoding genes. Their moderate-to-low overall transcription rate may be a consequence of inducible and/or tissue-specific expression. Using molecular modeling methods, a variety of potential spatial organizations of several such proteins are demonstrated. Possible roles of TM-HPts as modulators of MSP signaling pathway and corresponding putative mechanisms of their action are suggested.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

We evaluated whether seed traits derived from image scans could be used to predict germination traits in three perennial crop candidate species: sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), and silflower (Silphium integrifolium). Over 20,000 seeds were scanned, and PlantCV was used to extract 692 hue, saturation, and value (HSV) color features along with five morphological traits. We demonstrated that seed color, morphology, and germination traits were all influenced by maternal family, but patterns of correlation between germination traits and color and morphology traits are complex. To enable prediction from high-dimensional seed traits, we constructed relationship matrices from combinations of HSV and morphology features for use in phenomic selection models to predict germination proportion and timing. Model performance varied by trait, species, and cohort, and in many cases, predictions were significantly better than chance. HSV features, when combined with morphology, often yielded the most accurate predictions, with performance reaching a maximum of r = 0.33.

It is not known how these indirect azole effects depend on dose, timing, and specific azole used, or how they influence host interactions. Candida glabrata (recently renamed Nakaseomyces glabratus) is the second leading cause of candidiasis, and clinical strains have high rates of intrinsic resistance to azoles. We investigated the early responses of reference strains BG2 and CBS138 to sub-inhibitory doses of fluconazole and voriconazole, and particularly, how these responses affect host-pathogen interactions. Cell wall profiling and transcriptomic data revealed highly similar responses for each strain to both azoles, including the upregulation of several virulence factors, such as yapsins. We also observed significant increases in CBS138 survival in macrophages and increased virulence in Galleria mellonella after voriconazole exposure. Using a combination of pharmacological inhibition of calcium ion channels and deletion strains, we determined that voriconazole-enhanced virulence requires a yapsin protease, YPS1, and is regulated via the calcineurin pathway and the cell wall integrity pathway, both of which regulate YPS1 expression. We also observed that voriconazole treatment significantly reduced the virulence of the bck1{Delta} strain in G. mellonella, suggesting that inhibitors of the cell wall integrity pathway might potentiate azole activity by improving susceptibility to host killing.

Disseminated circulating tumor cells (CTCs) through the bloodstream seed metastatic tumors at distant sites. Most methods for enumerating CTCs in humans clinically rely on drawing and analyzing small blood samples, but these may yield inaccurate estimates of CTC burden and cannot measure CTC changes over time. Identification and enumeration of CTCs for experimental or clinical purposes largely rely on marker-driven analyses by flow cytometry. Aim: In principle, non-invasive fluorescence enumeration of CTCs directly in vivo could provide a more accurate method for enumerating CTCs. However, this will require specific contrast agent for CTCs. The goal of this work is to define characteristics of useful CTC contrast agents and perform preliminary testing of candidate contrast agents used for fluorescence guided surgery (FGS). Approach: We evaluated a clinical small-molecule folate receptor targeted contrast agent (OTL38, pafolacianine), a fluorogenic pan-cathepsin contrast agent (VGT-309, abenacianine), and a set of custom designed, small-molecule prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted contrast agents. We tested these contrast agents using in vitro cell culture models and in in vivo murine models. Results: All tested contrast agents showed high uptake and labeling by target cell lines, but also small but significant labeling of non-cancer blood cells. Contrast agents that exhibited rapid clearance from circulation and the fluorogenic approach resulted in significantly reduced non-specific interfering background fluorescence signals. Conclusions: Although the fluorescence contrast agents tested have properties useful for labeling of CTCs, as yet none exhibited the required high specificity. This resulted in some labeling of non-cancer blood cells which presented false-positive CTC counts. Improved contrast agent design and multiplexed use of more than one contrast agent may improve this specificity.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Machine learning-based age-estimators (such as epigenetic clocks) offer a robust method for capturing biomarkers that strongly correlate with age. In principle, we can use these estimators to find novel targets for aging research, which can then be used for developing drugs that can extend the healthspan. However, methylation-based clocks do not provide direct mechanistic insight into aging, limiting their utility for drug discovery. Here, we describe a method for building tissue-specific bulk RNA-seq-based age-estimators that can be used to identify the ageprint. The ageprint is a set of genes that drive baseline healthy aging in a tissue-specific, developmentally-linked fashion. Using our age estimator, SkeletAge, we narrowed down the ageprint of human skeletal muscles to 128 genes, of which 26 genes have never been studied in the context of aging or aging-associated phenotypes. The ageprint of skeletal muscles can be linked to known phenotypes of skeletal muscle aging and development, which further supports our hypothesis that the ageprint genes drive (healthy) aging along the growth-development-aging axis, which is separate from (biological) aging that takes place due to illness or stochastic damage. Lastly, we show that using our method, we can find druggable targets for aging research and use the ageprint to accurately assess the effect of therapeutic interventions, which can further accelerate the discovery of longevity-enhancing drugs.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

TFEA.ChIP is a ChIP-seq-based TF enrichment analysis tool that addresses this by linking TF binding profiles to differentially expressed genes through experimentally supported cis-regulatory element (CRE)-gene associations. Unlike motif- or heuristic-based approaches, TFEA.ChIP adopts a biologically grounded strategy by intersecting TF binding data from ReMap2022 with regulatory maps from ENCODE's rE2G and CREdb. To overcome the high context-specificity of rE2G associations, we developed filtering strategies based on confidence scores and recurrence across biosamples. Benchmarking on 369 curated gene sets from the MSigDB C2 CGP collection showed that recurrence-based filtering significantly improved accuracy, outperforming the original GeneHancer-based implementation and leading tools including BARTv2.0, Lisa, ChEA3, and HOMER. A case study on hypoxia further validated the method, demonstrating accurate and pathway-specific enrichment of HIF-related TFs using both overrepresentation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Additionally, the updated implementation of TFEA.ChIP in R/Bioconductor introduces several user-friendly features, including automated analysis workflows and expression-based filtering of candidate TFs. These additions streamline the integration of TFEA.ChIP into standard RNA-seq analysis pipelines, enabling more efficient and reproducible workflows. Together with its strong benchmarking performance and biologically grounded framework, the updated tool provides a robust and accessible solution for inferring transcriptional regulators from gene expression data.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Despite their critical influence, a consensus view of adult human colon fibroblast and CRC CAF heterogeneity, spatial organization, and developmental trajectories is currently lacking. Here, we address this gap by performing a comprehensive characterization of colonic fibroblasts and CRC CAFs. Using large-scale integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from normal colon and CRC we mapped the fibroblast subpopulations. Spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization were used for validation and computational analyses to predict developmental trajectories and transcription factors underlying CAF activation. Subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs), mucosa-associated fibroblasts (MAFs), and submucosa-associated fibroblasts (SAFs) were identified as the main colon fibroblast subtypes, and in mice, further divided into location-based subclusters. We also identified a novel colon fibroblast subset: muscle-embedded interstitial fibroblasts (MIFs). CRCs contained normal fibroblasts as well as four cancer-specific CAF populations: inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), and two precursor CAF (preCAF) subtypes. Our data suggested that iCAFs originate from SEMFs through a preCAF1 intermediate phenotype, while mCAFs derive from SAFs/MIFs via preCAF2s. Transcription factors PRRX1, MAFB, and TWIST1 were uncovered as potential regulators of CAF identity and CTHRC1 was identified as a specific and sensitive pan-CAF marker in CRC. Our study presents a detailed framework for understanding colon fibroblast and CRC CAF heterogeneity.

However, it remains unclear how variations in sleep are associated with the structurally heterogeneous subfields of the hippocampus and how this association relates to cognition in healthy young adults. This study aimed to elucidate the multivariate relationships among sleep duration, quality, and timing, the specific hippocampal subfield volumes, and cognitive functions in a large sample of healthy young adults. We applied multiset canonical correlation analysis to data from 942 young adults (ages 22-37) from the Human Connectome Project. We examined relationships among self-reported sleep parameters (via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), high-resolution hippocampal subfield volumes, and a broad set of cognitive performance measures. We identified a single significant mode of covariation, wherein better sleep health-characterized by a moderate sleep duration (reflecting a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship), higher sleep quality (e.g., fewer awakenings, less discomfort), and optimal sleep timing-was robustly associated with larger hippocampal volumes, particularly in the anterior subfields. This sleep-hippocampus pattern was also associated with enhanced cognitive performance. Our findings reveal a specific link among sleep, an anterior-dominant pattern of hippocampal structure, and cognition in healthy young adulthood. The anterior hippocampus may serve as a key neural hub through which the cognitive benefits of healthy sleep are manifested early in life.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

In such studies, methods based on gene expression levels (metatranscriptomic) analysis are promising. However specific tools are required to overcome the challenges posed by food microbiomes, in particular the high variability of microbiomes between samples and the difficulty of automatically inferring the annotation of metabolic functions across taxa. To address this gap, we present the Food Microbiome Metabolic Modules (F3M) tool suite, which comprises (1) a curated database containing about 1,985 functional genes representing key fermentative metabolic reactions in food microbiomes, (2) a F3M Builder for generating F3M-annotated gene catalogs and mapping of metatranscriptomic reads, and then (3) an F3M R package to parse and aggregate gene expression data by taxonomic and functional categories for downstream analysis. The F3M taxonomy is organized according to the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) nomenclature, whereas the F3M functional repertoire is structured hierarchically into 183 metabolic modules, which enable multi-scale analysis of inter-organism metabolic interactions and meaningful fermentative outputs (e.g., primary alcohols, acetate). Notably, a dedicated 'redox' module captures oxido-reduction mechanisms and NADH-dependent pathways central to fermentation, while an 'uptake' module complements the metabolic pathways to trace potential metabolite exchanges across taxa.

A.; Funabiki, H.", "abstract": "In eukaryotes with DNA methylation, the histone variant H2A.Z and DNA methylation are maintained in mutually exclusive sections of the genome. How this antagonism is established, however, remains an open question. Here, we examined the impacts of DNA methylation on both the intrinsic stability of H2A.Z nucleosomes and chaperone-mediated H2A.Z deposition. Cryo-EM and endonuclease accessibility analyses show that H2A.Z nucleosomes with methylated DNA are more open and accessible compared to their unmethylated counterparts. In Xenopus laevis, H2A.Z preferentially associates with unmethylated DNA in both the fibroblast cell line XTC-2 and sperm pronuclei formed in the transcriptionally silent egg extract. The proportion of H2A.Z that colocalizes with methylated DNA, however, is higher in sperm pronuclei than in XTC-2. By monitoring nucleosome assembly on synthetic DNA constructs in Xenopus egg extracts, we find that the H2A.Z bias for unmethylated substrates is dependent on the SRCAP complex, the major H2A.Z deposition chaperone. Consistently, recruitment of the SRCAP complex to DNA is suppressed by DNA methylation. Altogether, we propose that the SRCAP complex is the major determinant for preferential H2A.Z enrichment on unmethylated DNA, whereas DNA methylation destabilizes DNA wrapping in H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Yet, there is little evidence on whether such product substitution interventions effectively prevent illegal or unsustainable harvesting and contribute to the recovery of threatened populations. Drawing on the Furs For Life (FFL) Zambia initiative, which supplied synthetic furs known as Heritage Furs to replace leopard skins traditionally worn during Lozi royal ceremonies in Western Zambia, we present an evaluation designed to test both the effects and causal mechanisms of substitution. Guided by the EMMIE framework, commonly used in crime prevention evaluation, we triangulated data from semi-structured questionnaires, law enforcement patrols, court records, camera trap monitoring, and stakeholder interviews conducted between 2018 and 2024. Qualitative analysis using the General Elimination Method was employed to assess plausible alternative explanations for leopard recovery. By 2024, adoption of synthetic furs among leopard fur users exceeded 80 percent, while self-reported ownership of authentic leopard furs declined by 70 percent. At the same time, patrol detections of leopard poaching incidents decreased, and camera trap density estimates increased from an average of 2.7 to 3.8 leopards per 100 square kilometers across the focal landscape. An integrated mechanism of change, derived from stakeholder perspectives, indicates that while substitution reduced demand, concurrent and reinforcing effects of counter-poaching and counter-trafficking operations were critical to leopard recovery.

Movements of these small, nocturnal rodents are rapid and difficult to observe, potentially obscuring behavioral assessment. However, assessment became warranted when alopecia and jumping were noted. We compared trained human observers to machine learning trained computer vision algorithms, evaluating accuracy and precision in behavioral classification. Human observers categorized behaviors with an overall accuracy of 0.71 + 0.11 and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.92 + 0.07, with greater odds of misidentifying behaviors lasting less than one second. Computer vision classifiers successfully met human-grade accuracy and ICC, with significantly less sensitivity to behavioral duration. As 34% of manually classified behaviors lasted less than 0.5 seconds, we used computer vision to annotate activity budgets of captive jerboas before and after adding novel enrichment. Alopecia was significantly associated with grooming, and while grooming was negatively associated with terrarium height and with opaque dividers between terraria, conventional rodent enrichment had no significant effect on behavior. Inflammatory causes of alopecia were not found with cytologic, molecular, or histopathologic analysis. These results suggest captive jerboa may demonstrate psychogenic alopecia. Furthermore, computer vision automation allows for fast, accurate analysis of large volumes of behavioral data that can be used to tailor species-specific husbandry practices and improve animal welfare.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

E.; Lokhandwala, J.; Binning, J.

In humans, these repair functions are performed by Fructosamine-3 kinase (FN3K) and Ketosamine-3 kinase (KT3K) enzymes which share conserved catalytic mechanisms but differ in substrate specificity. Recent structural studies defined key active site residues required for FN3K activity on a model substrate, yet the molecular basis for differential substrate recognition by FN3K and KT3K remains unresolved. Here, we integrate phylogenetic analysis, ancestral protein reconstruction (APR), and mutational biochemistry to to elucidate how substrate specificity evolved within the fructosamine-3 kinase family. We show that conserved substrate-binding residues are required for the phosphorylation of both fructosamines and ketosamines, but do not contribute to substrate specificity. Using APR, we resurrected four ancestral fructosamine kinases that recapitulate the distinct substrate preferences of FN3K and KT3K despite differing by only 12 amino acids. Through mutational studies and structural analysis, we show that substrate specificity is modulated by an evolutionarily tuned allosteric network that enables long-range intramolecular communication. These insights provide a new mechanistic framework for understanding FN3K substrate selection and open avenues for rational design of FN3K-selective therapeutics targeting protein glycation in metabolic disease and aging.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

A.; Fujimori, T.; Sawai, S.; Okuda, S.", "abstract": "Cell sorting is a form of phase separation in populations of motile cells, such as epithelia. Cell polarity often plays a central role in cell sorting by influencing motility, adhesion, and mechanical stress. However, whether and how self-alignment of individual cells, without direct polarity coordination, can lead to stable domain formation remains unclear. Here, we introduce ``circulation-induced phase separation'' (CirPS), a distinct mechanism of phase separation driven by hierarchical cell ordering. Each polar motile cell, which self-aligns its polarity with its velocity, migrates by generating a tension gradient along its polarity at cell-cell boundaries, rather than by traction on the substrate. Two-dimensional (2D) vertex model simulations of a mixture of polar motile and nonmotile cells reveal phase separation of stable motile cell domains, each consisting of concentric cell circulations, with adjacent circulations aligned in an antiparallel direction. Domain formation proceeds in a self-enforcing manner: circulations generate a normal stress difference that effectively attracts the motile cells themselves, driving domain growth. Cell speed increases with the degree of ordering, and the domain size grows over time following a 1/3 power-law scaling in the low-noise regime, features distinct from conventional sorting, such as motility-induced phase separation and the Vicsek model. A similar antiparallel circulation pattern was observed in 2D aggregates of Dictyostelium discoideum, supporting the biological relevance of CirPS.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Gaining in depth knowledge about the tumor microenvironment, particularly the mechanisms of tumor-induced angiogenesis, is essential for the development of more precise and effective targeted therapies. Microvessel density (MVD) serves as a widely recognized measure of angiogenic activity and can be reliably assessed using immunohistochemical staining for PECAM-1 (CD31), a highly specific marker of vascular endothelial cells. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in the Department of Pathology, Satkhira Medical College, from April 2024 to March 2025. A total of 50 cases of invasive gastric adenocarcinoma were included. Routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining was performed for Lauren classification. Immunohistochemistry for PECAM-1 was conducted to highlight microvessels. Result: Among 50 cases, intestinal-type adenocarcinoma was more frequent than diffuse type. High MVD was observed in 58.1% of intestinal-type cases and 36.8% of diffuse-type cases. The difference in MVD between intestinal and diffuse types was statistically significant (p < 0.05), suggesting higher angiogenic activity in intestinal-type tumors. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that PECAM-1 positive MVD is significantly higher in the intestinal subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma compared to the diffuse subtype. These findings indicate a more angiogenically active tumor microenvironment in intestinal-type tumors, potentially correlating with greater invasive potential and metastatic behavior. PECAM-1 immunostaining provides a valuable tool for quantifying tumor angiogenesis and may serve as a prognostic marker or a basis for anti-angiogenic therapeutic targeting in gastric cancer management.", "date": "2025-07-31", "journal": ""}

Here, focusing on phosphorus, an essential nutrient for plant growth, we developed a low-cost and non-invasive biosensor to visualize and predict early stress signaling in plants. By combining plant phosphate (Pi)-deficiency-induced promoter systems with fungal self-sustained bioluminescence systems genetically engineered into tobacco plants, we created sensor plants that emitted more light when experiencing Pi deficiency. This light emission correlated with the expressions of known phosphate-responsive genes and the total phosphorus content in plants, and decreased during Pi recovery conditions, demonstrating the responsiveness and robustness of the sensor plants in reflecting endogenous phosphorus deficiency. The sensor plants responded primarily to Pi deficiency rather than nitrogen or potassium deficiencies and were sensitive to different ranges of external Pi concentrations. Additionally, when grafted onto tomato and chili pepper plants, the sensor plants responded to external phosphorus deficiency, showing promise for monitoring stress signals in different crop species. Using deep-learning-based image analysis techniques, auto-luminescent signals of sensor plants could be detected and used to predict phosphorus deficiency.

People in Kalimantan (Indonesia) collect young leaves and fronds from wild populations for use as vegetables or medicines to treat conditions, such as ulcers, stomachaches, fever, diarrhoea, and skin infections. The young leaves and fronds of S. palustris contain flavonoids, polyphenols, and anthocyanins. Here, we present a high-quality organ-specific transcriptome assembly of S. palustris based on long-read RNA sequencing of young leaves. Results: The de novo assembly yielded 47,759 transcripts, with an N50 of 1,524 bp and a BUSCO completeness of 66.6%, consistent with organ-specific transcriptomes. Functional annotation identified key structural and regulatory genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, including genes for chalcone synthase (CHS) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR). We further analysed the expression of the selected CHS and DFR genes via qRT-PCR of three phenotypically contrasting young leaf samples. Although no strong correlation was observed between gene expression levels and anthocyanin pigmentation, the results suggest that complex regulation involves post-transcriptional control or developmental timing.

However, in vivo assessments that can directly inform brain mitochondrial functioning and its etiopathophysiological path to SSD remain difficult to obtain. We hypothesized that system and brain mitochondrial dysfunctions in SSD may be indexed by elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) levels in the blood and in neuronal extracellular vesicles (nEVs). We also explored if these mtDNA marker elevations were associated brain metabolites as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). We examined blood cf-mtDNA in 58 SSD patients and 33 healthy controls, followed by assessing nEV mtDNA and metabolite levels using MRS in a subgroup of patients and controls. We found that people with SSD had significantly elevated cf-mtDNA levels in both the blood (p=0.0002) and neuronal EVs (p=0.003) compared to controls. These mtDNA abnormalities can be linked back to brain lactate+ levels such that higher blood and nEV mtDNA levels were significantly associated with higher lactate+ levels measured at the anterior cingulate cortex (r=0.53, 0.53; p=0.008, 0.03, respectively) in SSD patients.

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are among the first responders in the lung following pneumococcal infection and are required for bacterial clearance. However, PMN antimicrobial function declines with age. To identify mechanisms underlying this decline, we performed RNA sequencing on PMNs in the lungs of young and old mice following pulmonary infection with S. pneumoniae. We observed significant transcriptomic differences across host age. Transcriptional analysis followed by functional validation revealed that in infected mice, PMNs from aged hosts failed to upregulate several effector activities including glycolysis and subsequent mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which are necessary for bacterial killing by PMNs. Analysis of potential transcription factors controlling these changes indicated differential regulation by E2f2 in aged mice, which was linked to lower PMN differentiation resulting in more immature PMNs in the lungs of aged mice compared to young controls. Conversely, PMNs in aged mice displayed a higher senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) score and upregulated pathways involved in cellular senescence. Follow-up functional characterization found that in uninfected hosts, PMNs in aged mice expressed higher levels of SASP factors IL-10, TNF-a, and ROS, had lower incidence of apoptosis, and had a higher proportion of cells positive for senescence-associated b-galactosidase, features of a senescent-like phenotype.

Given that nearly half of subjects with chronic OUD contract hepatitis C (HCV), we further stratified our findings by maternal HCV status. Our results indicate that maternal OUD leads to a higher incidence of vascular malperfusion accompanied by increased levels of inflammatory markers and dysregulated secretion of placental development factors. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomics revealed that maternal OUD disrupts the communication between trophoblasts and immune cells important for placental vascular development. Additionally, CellChat analysis revealed aberrant VEGF and FN1 signaling across trophoblast, endothelial, and myeloid cells. Processes associated with tissue homeostasis and repair were also downregulated across trophoblast and leukocytes. Frequencies and responses to ex-vivo stimulation of decidual macrophages and cytolytic NK cells, critical for tissue remodeling and fetal tolerance, were decreased.

We quantify changes in over 300 species caused by interactions between diet, age, and genetic background. Traditional bioinformatics approaches linked particular microbes to observed phenotypes, while newer machine learning models based microbial clusters accurately predicted host outcomes, including individual body weight (AUC = 0.92) and chronological age (AUC = 0.84). This was further enhanced by a compact 10-feature multi-omics model, combining our microbiome data with prior liver expression data to increase chronological age AUC to 0.95.
