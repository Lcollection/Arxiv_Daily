We have developed an R package, Structured Joint Decomposition (SJD), which identifies components of variation that are shared across multiple matrices. The approach focuses specifically on variation across the samples/cells within each dataset while incorporating biologist-defined hierarchical structure among input experiments that can span in vivo and in vitro systems, multi-omic data modalities, and species. SJD enables the definition of molecular variation that is conserved across systems, those that are shared within subsets of studies, and elements unique to individual matrices. We have included functions to simplify the construction and visualization of highly complex in silico experiments involving many diverse multi-omic matrices from multiple species. Here we apply SJD to decompose four RNA-seq experiments focused on neurogenesis in the neocortex. The public datasets used in this analysis are at NeMO Analytics and can be explored at the individual gene level or using the conserved transcriptomic dynamics in mammalian neurogenesis that we define here.

In the gastrointestinal tract, this transport indirectly impacts nutrient absorption. However, the mechanisms governing ion transport through these channels remain poorly understood. We addressed this question by building on our previous cell culture studies and all atom molecular dynamic simulation model of CLDN15. By mutating D55 to a bulkier glutamic acid (E) or neutral amino acid asparagine (N), our in vitro measurements showed that the D55E mutation decreased charge selectivity and favored small ion permeability, while the D55N mutation led to reduced charge selectivity without markedly altering size selectivity. By establishing a simplified (reduced) CLDN15 molecular dynamics model that excludes non-essential transmembrane regions, we were able to probe how D55 modified cation dehydration, charge interaction, and permeability. These results provide novel insight into organization of the CLDN15 selectivity filter and suggests that D55 plays a dual role in shaping both electrostatic and steric properties of the pore, but its electrostatic role is more prominent in determining CLDN15 cation permeability. This knowledge can be used toward the development of effective strategies to modulate CLDN15 function. The experimental approach established can be further extended to study the function of other claudin channels. Together, these advancements will help us to modulate tight junctions to promote human health.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

We identified distinct neural subspaces, or manifolds, for semantic and phonetic features, with a functional separation of the corresponding low-dimensional dynamics. We contrasted a bottom-up cumulative and a top-down predictive hypothesis on phonetic-semantic temporal alignment, and found phonetic alignment to word-level semantic representations, signaling top-down prediction.

W.", "abstract": "Reconciliation algorithms provide an accounting of the evolutionary history of individual gene trees given a species tree. Many reconciliation algorithms consider only duplication and loss events (and sometimes horizontal transfer), ignoring effects of the coalescent process, including incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we present a new algorithm for carrying out reconciliation that accurately accounts for incomplete lineage sorting by treating ILS as a series of nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) events. For discordant branches of the gene tree identified by last common ancestor (LCA) mapping, our algorithm recursively chooses the optimal history by comparing the cost of duplication and loss to the cost of NNI and loss. We demonstrate the accuracy of our new method, which we call reconcILS, using a new simulation engine (dupcoal) that can accurately generate gene trees produced by the interaction of duplication, ILS, and loss. We show that reconcILS is much more accurate than models that ignore ILS, and at least as accurate or better than the leading method that can model ILS, duplication, and loss. We discuss how our method can also be extended in the future for use as a reconciliation algorithm in additional scenarios.

This study investigates the phenomenon of Mind Blanking (MB), characterized by an \"emptiness of mind\", comparing it with Mind Wandering (MW) and On-task (ON) states. Using a sustained attention task and electroencephalogram monitoring, behavioral and neurophysiological signatures of MB were examined in 62 participants. MB exhibited a specific pattern of behavioral lapses, as well as decreased fast oscillatory activity and complexity over posterior electrodes compared to MW. Functional connectivity analyses revealed decreased long-range inter-areal connectivity during MB, compared to both ON and MW states. Event-related potentials with source reconstruction and temporal decoding techniques indicated a significant disruption in visual processing during MB, starting from 200 ms post stimulus and echoing into the late-stage of visual processing, suggesting a disruption of conscious access to sensory information during MB. EEG-derived markers allowed the prediction of mental states at the trial level, offering a finer view of conscious dynamics than subjective reports alone. Overall, these findings challenge the notion of the wakeful conscious mind as inherently content-oriented, suggesting that MB reflects genuine gaps in the stream of conscious thoughts, arising from disruptions in the generation or accessibility of thought content.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Using spatially resolved genomic analysis in avian embryos, we observed that the epigenome becomes organized in gradients of accessibility and activity along the embryonic axes. These chromatin gradients are established within the loci of developmental genes at the onset of gastrulation and can be used to infer the position of cells in the embryo. Our results show that axial specification involves the spatial organization of the epigenome, linking patterns of chromatin activity to the emergence of the embryonic body plan.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

To investigate how the human brain implements this, we used a new approach to study plasticity and stability across hierarchical processing stages in visual cortex. We compare the rod system of individuals born with rod-only photoreceptor inputs (achromatopsia) to the typically developed rod system, allowing us to dissociate impacts of life-long versus transient responses to altered input. Cortical input stages (V1) exhibited high stability, with input-deprived cortex showing no retinotopic remapping and exhibiting structural hallmarks of deprivation. However, plasticity manifested as reorganised read-out of these inputs by higher-order cortex, in a pattern that could compensate for the lower resolution of a rod-only system and its lack of high-density foveal input. We propose that these hierarchical dynamics robustly optimise processing of available input and could reflect a broader principle of brain organisation with important implications for emerging sight-rescue therapies.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Dynein converts the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into coordinated structural changes to step processively along MTs, but how dynein couples ATP hydrolysis to a minus-end-directed step remains controversial. The dynamics of dynein stepping have previously been characterized by tracking flexible regions of the motor with limited resolution. Here, we site-specifically labeled yeast dynein at its MT-binding domain by developing a cysteine-light mutant and tracked its stepping at sub-millisecond and nanometer resolution at physiological ATP concentrations using MINFLUX. We show that dynein hydrolyzes one ATP per step and takes multiples of 8 nm steps. Steps are preceded by a transient movement towards the plus end. These backward 'dips' correspond to MT release upon ATP binding and subsequent diffusion of the stepping monomer around its MT-bound partner. Functional assays showed that dips terminate with a minus-end-directed movement upon ATP hydrolysis.

Although neural responses often confer protective benefits, they can also exacerbate inflammation during allergic reactions such as asthma. In our study, we modeled pollution-exacerbated asthma by exposing mice to ambient PM2.5 particles alongside ovalbumin. Compared to exposure to ovalbumin alone, this co-exposure significantly increased the numbers of neutrophils and {gamma}{delta} T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We found that silencing nociceptor neurons at the peak of inflammation using intranasal QX-314 or ablating TRPV1-expressing neurons reduced lung neutrophil accumulation. Live in vivo intravital imaging confirmed that neuronal ablation reduced neutrophil numbers and increased their net displacement capacity. In neurons isolated from mice with pollution-exacerbated asthma, the chemical-sensing TRPA1 channel exhibited heightened sensitivity to its cognate ligand. Elevated levels of artemin were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pollution-exposed mice but returned to baseline in mice with ablated nociceptor neurons. Alveolar macrophages expressing the pollution-sensing aryl hydrocarbon receptor were identified as a putative source of artemin following exposure to PM2.5. This molecule enhanced TRPA1 responsiveness and, in turn, drove nociceptor-mediated neutrophil recruitment, revealing a novel mechanism by which lung-innervating neurons respond to air pollution in the context of allergy. Overall, our findings suggest that targeting artemin-driven pathways could provide a therapeutic strategy for controlling neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma, a clinical condition typically refractory to treatment.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated whether IL-27 neutralization could modulate macrophage polarization and thereby alter the tumor immune microenvironment.\n\nThe effects of IL-27 neutralization were examined using complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches. In vitro, human macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, ELISA, and Western blot to assess changes in their immunoregulatory profile. In vivo, the MC38 murine colon adenocarcinoma model was used to evaluate the impact of IL-27 blockade on the tumor immune microenvironment.\n\nOur findings highlight a key role for IL-27 in promoting the immunosuppressive phenotype of human macrophages. Mechanistically, IL-27 neutralization diminished macrophage-mediated suppression by reducing cytokine production and the expression of immunoinhibitory surface molecules. These modifications led to a reduction in the ability of macrophages to inhibit the function of CD4{square} and CD8{square} T cells. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of IL-27 attenuated MC38 tumor growth and enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy.\n\nCollectively, targeting IL-27 promoted macrophage repolarization and enhanced CD4{square} and CD8{square} T cell responses.

A machine learning classifier was trained to discriminate passages containing chills from those not containing chills. The results show that chills onsets are predicted better than chance and corroborate existing evidence for acoustic elicitors of chills with a much larger dataset.

We sequenced over 500 samples across Pando and neighboring clones, including multiple tissue types. At fine spatial scales, we detected significant genetic structure, particularly in leaf tissue, but this signal weakened across larger distances, suggesting either rapid root growth homogenizes the system over time or mechanisms exist that prevent widespread mutation transmission. Phylogenetic analyses date Pando between 12,000 and 37,000 years old, supported by continuous aspen pollen presence in nearby lake sediments. Tissues accumulated mutations at different rates, with leaves showing significantly higher mutation loads than roots or branches. This work provides the first quantitative age estimate for this remarkable organism and offers initial insights into the spatial dynamics of somatic mutation in a massive clonal plant.

Although many methods have been developed to infer such co-expression networks from single-cell data, the lack of consideration of false positive control in many evaluations and downstream analyses may lead to incorrect conclusions because higher reproducibility, higher functional coherence, and a larger overlap with known biological networks may not imply better performance if the false positives are not well controlled. In this study, we systematically compared two distinct criteria for selecting correlated gene pairs from single-cell data, p-value versus correlation strength. We found that the use of p-values instead of correlation strength is more robust for both selecting meaningful gene pairs and for the fair benchmarking of co-expression estimation methods. To make this approach universally applicable, we extended and validated a simulation method that can efficiently and reliably generate empirical p-values for co-expression estimation methods that do not have corresponding or well-controlled p-values. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a fair comparison of the estimation methods requires adjusting for the varying number of gene pairs they identified and accounting for the inherent expression-level biases within ground truth biological networks.

We analyzed two datasets: calcium imaging from mouse V1 layers 2/3 and 4, and extracellular neurophysiological recordings from macaque V1 and V4. Our results show that neuronal activity can be predicted bidirectionally between L2/3 and L4 in mice, and between V1 and V4 in macaques, with the latter interaction exhibiting directional asymmetry. The predictability of neuronal responses varied with the type of visual stimulus, yet responses could also be predicted in the absence of visual stimulation. In mice, we observed a bimodal distribution of neurons, with some neurons primarily driven by visual inputs and others showing predictable activity during spontaneous activity despite lacking consistent visually evoked responses. Predictability also depended on intrinsic neuronal properties, receptive field overlap, and the relative timing of activity across areas.

Prior studies also suggest that biochar may have specific developmental effects on legumes, including increased root nodulation and altered morphology. We examined the growth and morphometric responses of legume and non-legume tropical trees to biochar additions in a common garden pot trial experiment. Four legume species (Acacia auriculiformis, A. mangium, Delonix regia, and Pterocarpus santalinus) and four non-legumes (Eucalyptus alba, Melia azedarach, Swietenia macrophylla, and Syzygium cumini) were compared in terms of sapling responses to additions of a wood-feedstock biochar applied at 10 and 20 t/ha. Overall, strong positive effects of biochar additions on sapling performance were observed, with an average increase of 30% in total biomass and a notable increase in height relative to diameter growth. Species showed pronounced differences in responses, with strong interactive effects of species and biochar treatments on growth metrics. Legume species showed an average increase somewhat greater than non-legumes; however, responses were variable among species, with the two Acacia species showing the largest responses, resulting in a non-significant pattern. A literature-based meta-analysis of tropical and subtropical trees likewise suggests greater biochar responses in legumes, but the analysis also falls short of statistical significance. In addition, experimental results indicate large interactive effects of species and biochar on soil pH and other soil properties. Large growth responses of certain taxa of legumes (and other taxa) to biochar, and pronounced species-specific effects on soil properties, may reflect evolved responses to fire disturbance that can be leveraged in the context of forest restoration and enhanced carbon sequestration in degraded tropical landscapes.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Using fMRI data from 772 participants performing an extensively-validated language localizer paradigm that isolates language processing from other processes, we a) delineate a comprehensive set of areas that respond reliably to language across written and auditory modalities, and b) evaluate these areas selectivity for language relative to a demanding non-linguistic task. In line with prior claims, many areas outside the core fronto-temporal network respond during language processing, and most of them show selectivity for language relative to general task demands. These language-selective areas of the extended language network include areas around the temporal poles, in the medial frontal cortex, in the hippocampus, and in the cerebellum, among others. Although distributed across many parts of the brain, the extended language-selective network still only comprises ~3.5% of the grey matter volume and is about the size of a large strawberry, challenging the view that the entire brain processes language. These newly identified language-selective areas can now be systematically characterized to decipher their contributions to language processing, including testing whether these contributions differ from those of the core language areas.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

We introduce Ledidi, a computational method that rephrases the discrete design task of choosing which edits to make as an easily solvable continuous optimization problem. Ledidi can use any pre-trained deep learning model to guide the optimization, yielding an edited sequence that exhibits the desired outcome while explicitly minimizing the number of edits used. When applied in dozens of settings, we find that Ledidi's designs can precisely control transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility, transcription, and enhancer activity in silico. By using several deep learning models simultaneously, we design cell type-specific enhancers and experimentally validate them in cellulo. Finally, we introduce the concept of an \"affinity catalog\", where the design task is repeated multiple times across continuous variants of the design target. We demonstrate how these catalogs can be used to interpret deep learning models and the impact of starting template sequences, and also to design regulatory elements that control transcriptional dosage while maintaining cell type-specificity.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Background: Dietary proteins are major modulators of gut microbial ecology, yet the taxonomic and functional signatures of plant- versus animal-based proteins remain poorly defined. Although digestibility and fermentation differ by protein type, a systematic evaluation of how these differences shape microbial diversity and metabolic capacity is lacking. This Meta-analysis integrates conventional and machine learning approaches to identify microbial biomarkers and predicted functions associated with dietary protein sources in murine models. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from 10 murine studies (n = 187) comparing animal and plant protein diets. Alpha diversity was assessed using Shannon, Inverse Simpson, and Chao1 indices. Beta diversity was evaluated using Aitchison distances. LEfSe and class-weighted Random Forest models were applied to identify differentially abundant taxa and predictive microbial features. Functional profiles were inferred using PICRUSt2, and taxon, pathway associations were examined via correlation and network analysis. Results: Plant-protein diets significantly increased microbial richness and evenness across all alpha diversity metrics. Thirty-three genera were enriched, including Bacteroides, Muribaculaceae, and Allobaculum, associated with SCFA production, nitrogen recycling, and bile acid metabolism. Animal-protein diets favored Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and Colidextribacter, linked to proteolytic fermentation and sulfur metabolism. Aitchison PCA revealed distinct community structures (ANOSIM R = 0.663, p < 0.001). Random Forest models achieved >88% accuracy (AUC = 0.995) in predicting diet groups. Functional prediction showed plant diets enriched SCFA and aromatic amino acid degradation pathways, while animal diets favored sulfur and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Network analysis identified Muribaculaceae and Lactobacillus as central taxa in plant- and animal-associated subnetworks, respectively. However, variation in fat and fiber across studies may confound these patterns, as these covariates were not consistently reported. Conclusion: Dietary protein source shapes gut microbial composition and predicted function in murine models, reflecting distinct shifts in microbial nitrogen and sulfur metabolism.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Previous studies suggest that it is associated with reproductive benefits, either by making breeders newly available for reproduction or by increasing offspring care and reducing competition for resources. In addition, infanticide may result from a reproductive trade-off, where parents kill their offspring if environmental conditions compromise their reproductive value. Here, we combine video, genetic and individual-level reproductive data collected over 12 years to describe infanticide in a highly social, cooperative bird, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius and to establish whether direct reproductive benefits or life-history trade-offs are possible motivators for this behaviour. We documented 50 cases of infanticide and identified 27 aggressors with known histories. These were mostly born outside the colonies where they committed infanticide (63%) and there was a bias towards younger individuals. Aggressors were usually not part of the victim's breeding group (74%), but in two cases infanticide was committed by the breeding female, and in five by helpers. In most cases, aggressors were not reproducing at the time of the infanticide, were not recorded mating with any of the breeders or helpers from the attacked nest, nor occupied the nest from where the chicks were evicted. Only 13 of the known aggressors were confirmed as breeders after the attacks, and these mostly reproduced at the colony where the attacks were committed. Overall, we found no evidence for direct reproductive benefits of infanticide in sociable weavers. However, the younger age of aggressors, lack of genetic relatedness to the victims and future breeding at the colony suggest that competition between breeding groups, and hence indirect reproductive benefits, could provide motivation for infanticide in this population. Additional work over longer periods is needed to identify these possible indirect fitness benefits of infanticide.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we revisited pioneering observations that trial-by-trial variability in either SC or V1 visual responses may predict variability in eye movement timing. We found that V1 covariation with behavioral variability was virtually non-existent in comparison to the SC, whether with respect to visual response onset latency, visual response strength, or pre-stimulus state. By far, with respect to sensory response properties, the largest predictor of behavioral variability was visual response strength in SC visual-motor neurons. These results suggest that the SC reformats its sensory inputs for exploitation of the SCs proximity to the motor periphery; V1 aids in jumpstarting the sensing process, but the SC much more directly supports visually-driven orienting.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Nearly all published models to date are based on cross-sectional data, limiting their ability to predict longitudinal change. Methods: Here, we used longitudinal brain data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, comprising cortical thickness measures from 180 regions per hemisphere in youths at baseline (N=6179; 47% females), 2-year (N=6179; 47% females), and 4-year (N=805; 45% females) follow-up. A training set was established from baseline and 2-year follow-up data (N=5374; 47% females), while data from individuals with all three time points available served as an independent test set (N=805; 45% females). We developed sex-specific Baseline-Conditioned Norms (B-Norms) that predict brain region thickness at follow-up based on baseline thickness, baseline age, and follow-up age, and compared them to sex-specific Cross-Sectional Norms (C-Norms) based on age alone. Results: Out-of-sample testing in 2-year and 4-year follow-up data showed that B-Norms consistently provided better fits than C-Norms for nearly all cortical regions. Explained variance was higher in B-Norms than in C-Norms. No significant differences between time points (p = 0.45) were detected. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed differences in higher-order moments (e.g., skewness and kurtosis) for both models; for example, skewness varied by model, sex, time point, and their interactions. Conclusion: While improved fit alone does not necessarily indicate a superior normative model, since normative models aim to capture population variance rather than simply optimize fit, we demonstrated that four regions were associated with pubertal changes in B-Norms but not in C-Norms, suggesting enhanced sensitivity of B-Norms to developmental processes.

However, some TE insertions are beneficial because they improve host fitness. Adaptive TE insertions sometimes alter the function of adjacent genes by positively and negatively impacting their expression, or by altering their encoding proteins. Alternatively, individual TE insertions can also be adaptive because they occur in piRNA clusters and lead to piRNA-mediated silencing of transposition. In a recent laboratory evolution experiment, we discovered that the long non-coding RNA CR43651 is an adaptive insertion hot spot for P-element DNA transposons in Drosophila melanogaster. The functional effects of these insertions on P-element repression and CR43651 function were unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of CR43651 insertions on P-element transcriptional regulation, piRNA biogenesis, and viability. We determined that although CR43651 is not a canonical piRNA cluster, chromosomes containing antisense P-element insertions in CR43651 exhibit enhanced piRNA-like silencing in the stage of oogenesis when P-elements transpose, potentially explaining their adaptive benefit. We also discovered that the fitness benefit provided by P-element repression is offset by recessive viability effects of insertion chromosomes, potentially due to disrupted production of mir14, a miRNA produced from CR43651.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Methods: Whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing were performed on paired tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 23 consented patients treated at two Kenyan referral hospitals. Variants were called with Mutect2 using a study-specific panel of normals; functional consequences were annotated with VEP. After featureCounts quantification, differential expression was analyzed in DESeq2 (fold-change [&ge;] 1.5, p < 0.05). Two-sample t-tests (mutations) and ANOVA (expression) evaluated relationships with HER2 status and clinical stage. Results: A total of 358 somatic mutations were detected: 170 in ZNF217, 24 in ZNF703 and 164 in ZNF750. Single-nucleotide substitutions (319 SNPs) dominated, with C[-&gt;]T and A[-&gt;]G changes most common; 27 deletions and 2 insertions were also observed. Frameshift events in ZNF217 and ZNF703 introduced premature stop codons predicted to truncate protein function. All three genes were significantly up-regulated in tumors versus normals (ZNF217 p = 0.0004), with the greatest expression in HER2-positive tumors and in stages 2-3 disease. Mutation burden for each gene did not differ by HER2 status (p > 0.56) or by stage (p > 0.32). Conclusions: Kenyan breast tumors harbor frequent, functionally relevant mutations and marked over-expression of ZNF217, ZNF703, and ZNF750.

The composition of these white matter connections (SC) shapes inter-regional signaling dynamics giving rise to spatial patterns of synchronous functional connectivity (FC). Several modeling approaches have proven useful for studying the mechanisms underlying the relationship between SC and FC. However, the myelination of white matter tracts -- a major component of white matter connectivity -- is not accounted for by conventional SC networks, and thus, has largely been excluded from models of FC. Here, we expand structure-function brain modeling by integrating a multi-feature white matter SC network. We use multi-modal MRI to compute an SC network with connections (edges) weighted by the caliber, myelination, and length of white matter tracts. We investigate the relationship of this multi-feature SC network with both haemodynamic and electromagnetic FC. Edge myelin was strongly predictive of FC in a pattern that was heterogeneous across brain regions and timescales of neural function. Edge myelin showed strong, frequency-specific interactions with both edge caliber and length suggesting a modulatory role for white matter myelin in structure-function coupling. This was further supported by antagonistic gradients of white matter myelin and structure-function coupling along the sensory-association axis. We describe in detail the individual and joint relationships between these major white matter features and multi-frequency FC. These results illustrate the advantage of a more comprehensive characterization of white matter in structure-function models and establish how white matter myelin -- known for roles in conduction velocity, plasticity, and metabolic support at the microscale -- shapes brain function at the macroscale.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

While previous studies suggest that pyramidal-interneuron network gamma (PING) and interneuron network gamma (ING) mechanisms contribute to these oscillations, the precise role of inhibitory circuits remains unclear. Using optogenetic stimulation and whole-cell electrophysiology in acute mouse brain slices, we examined synaptic input and spike timing in neurons across layer II/III mEC. We found that fast-spiking interneurons exhibited robust gamma-frequency firing, while excitatory neurons engaged in gamma cycle skipping. Stellate and pyramidal cells received minimal recurrent excitation, whereas fast-spiking interneurons received strong excitatory input. Both excitatory neurons and fast-spiking interneurons received gamma frequency inhibition, emphasizing the role of recurrent inhibition in gamma rhythm generation. Notably, gamma activity was reduced, but persisted after AMPA/kainate receptor blockade, indicating that interneurons can sustain gamma oscillations independently through an ING mechanism. Selective activation of PV+ interneurons confirmed their ability to sustain fast gamma inhibition autonomously. To further assess the interplay of excitation and inhibition, we developed computational network models constrained by our experimental data. Simulations revealed that weak excitatory input to interneurons supports fast ING-dominated rhythms (~100-140 Hz), while strengthening excitatory drive induces a transition to slower PING-dominated oscillations (60-100 Hz). These findings highlight the dominant role of inhibitory circuits in sustaining gamma rhythms, demonstrate how excitation strength tunes the oscillatory regime, and refine models of entorhinal gamma oscillations critical for spatial memory processing.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

We identify MAP7 as a key regulator of cytoskeletal integration required for apical domain formation. MAP7 localizes to apical microtubules without overlapping stable, acetylated tubulin. MAP7 loss disrupts apical architecture, causes ectopic tight junction expansion, and prevents lumen formation during the first wave of spermatogenesis. Although microtubule stability is largely preserved in Map7-deficient Sertoli cells, their orientation is severely disrupted, indicating that MAP7 directs dynamic remodeling for proper apical organization. Proteomics shows that MAP7 associates with MYH9 and MYH10, and MYH9, normally enriched at luminal regions where microtubules and F-actin converge, becomes diffuse by Map7 knockout, suggesting that MAP7 mediates spatial coupling of microtubules and actomyosin.

Mechanistic analysis conducted on Sugar Snap showed improved nodulation, mineral status, and photosystem efficiency, while split-root assays revealed that B. subtilis triggered systemic signaling underlying alkaline tolerance. Further, FeEDDHA partially reduced alkaline stress symptoms but did not fully restore nodulation. In contrast, B. subtilis enhanced siderophore availability and improved nodulation, leading to stronger symbiotic recovery than inorganic Fe alone. This indicates that nodulation recovery is driven primarily by B. subtilis mediated stimulation of Rhizobium leguminosarum, not by Fe availability alone. This is further supported by in vitro co-culture experiments that showed increased growth of both R. leguminosarum and B. subtilis, pointing to their complementary interactions that promote mutual fitness under alkaline stress. RNA-seq analysis identified 958 upregulated and 1,134 downregulated genes in roots inoculated with B. subtilis under alkaline conditions. The upregulated genes were mostly involved in the sugar-mediated symbiotic association (SWEET and GLUT), pH homeostasis (cation/H+ exchanger and ATPase), and nutrient assimilation (Ammonium transporter and Zn/Fe permease). Furthermore, B. subtilis reshaped the rhizosphere by restoring microbial community structure and enriching beneficial taxa such as Pseudomonas, Pseudorhizobium, and Chaetomium, which may act as helper microbes to promote pea survival under alkalinity.

However, the effects of disrupted circadian rhythms on bone remodeling remain largely unknown. Here, we show that one of the core circadian regulators PER1 inhibits osteoclastogenesis by upregulating genes involved in inflammation. The conditional knockout of Per1 in osteoclasts and related cells resulted in decreased bone mass in the femurs of mice, along with increased osteoclasts and decreased osteoblasts. Osteoclastogenesis was also promoted by Per1 depletion in vitro with 16 downregulated inflammatory genes. Seven of these genes were known to promote or inhibit osteoclastogenesis depending on the stage of osteoclastogenesis and the presence or absence of infection. Knockdown of Nlrp3, Tlr8, or Tlr9 in the group of genes promoted osteoclastogenesis, mirroring the effects of Per1 knockout and offering a mechanistic explanation for the Per1-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. These results were not observed following the knockout of a paralog Per2. Per1 knockout mice maintain general circadian rhythms, unlike arrhythmic Per1;Per2 double knockout mice. This gives credence to Per1 as a selective target for therapeutic interventions without disrupting the circadian rhythms. This study uncovered a molecular link between a circadian regulator and osteoclastogenesis in the broader context of inflammatory reactions.

Here, we mapped transcription factor (TF)-promoter interactions for nine PSY and three PSYR genes by combining high-throughput enhanced yeast one-hybrid screening with DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (DAP-seq) data, uncovering 1,207 interactions that reveal both shared and gene-specific regulatory relationships, defining the global TF-promoter interaction network of the PSY/PSYR pathway.

This motif is also located in the last 3' terminal exon of Topoisomerase 3A (TOP3A). Guided by these insights, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated promoter editing to delete a small region encompassing or flanking a functional TF-binding site (TFBS). Removal of this motif, or of its surrounding region, enhanced root growth, yielding variants that retained root length comparable to the crf10 mutant.

Additionally, they reveal a new mechanism that contributes to the long-discussed link between cancer and inflammation, wherein the tumor suppressor p53 inhibits cytokine production in parallel.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

M.; Brams, M.; Gallardo, R.; De Gieter, S.; Kusch, J.; Ulens, C.", "abstract": "Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels generate rhythmic electrical activity in cardiac and neuronal tissues, with isoform-specific cAMP sensitivity remaining poorly understood. While HCN2 exhibits strong cAMP regulation, HCN1 shows minimal response. To investigate the structural basis of this divergence, we analyzed two engineered HCN1 variants using cryo-electron microscopy. One variant (HCN112) incorporates the C-linker and CNBD from HCN2 into the HCN1 backbone and exhibited enhanced cAMP sensitivity, with structural analysis revealing a compressed cytoplasmic domain arrangement that may facilitate regulatory interactions. In contrast, the truncated HCN1{Delta}C variant (lacking the cytoplasmic domain) displayed an intermediately open pore conformation, supporting auto-inhibitory regulation by the CNBD in wild-type channels. These structural insights elucidate how domain-specific interactions modulate cAMP-dependent gating and intrinsic auto-inhibition, resolving long-standing questions about mechanistic divergence among HCN isoforms. Our findings not only shed new light on the structural mechanisms underlying isoform-specific cAMP sensitivity but also have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting HCN channels in neurological and cardiac disorders.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are essential regulators of rhythmic electrical activity in the heart and brain, and their dysfunction is linked to disorders such as epilepsy, depression, and cardiac arrhythmias. Although HCN channel isoforms display highly divergent responses to cAMP modulation, the structural basis for these differences has remained elusive. This study reveals, through cryo-EM structures, how domain-specific interactions within the cytoplasmic regions of HCN1 channels underlie their unique gating and auto-inhibition properties, as well as their muted cAMP sensitivity compared to HCN2. These insights resolve long-standing mechanistic questions about HCN channel regulation and pave the way for rational design of targeted therapies that selectively modulate HCN isoform activity in neurological and cardiac disease.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) could have therapeutic applications in IBD due to their regenerative potential and immunomodulatory properties. Previous studies investigating the potential of MSC-EVs in IBD have largely administered the vesicles by injection, which does not offer the significant benefits of oral administration, including direct and localised access to the site(s) of intestinal inflammation. Here, we evaluated the stability of MSC-EVs for oral delivery by assessing particle size, concentration and EV markers. The EVs disintegrated in gastrointestinal (GI) fluids, with cryogenic electron microscopy confirming the loss of structural integrity. To address this, we developed a double-coating formulation consisting of chitosan and Eudragit S100 to enhance GI stability and facilitate colon-targeted delivery. We demonstrated that coated EVs were resistant to GI fluids and digestive enzymes, and the formulation released intact vesicles in colonic fluid. Preliminary in vivo studies in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mouse model showed that coated EVs reduced disease severity, whereas uncoated EVs performed similarly to the control group. Interestingly, coated MSC-EVs elicited a stronger therapeutic response compared to EVs administered intravenously at the same dose. These findings indicate that oral delivery of MSC-EVs could be an effective route of administration, with appropriate formulation, to treat intestinal inflammation.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

F. S.; van Nijnatten, T. J. A.; Bitorina, A.; Hildebrand, S.; Schueth, A. A.", "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide, with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) representing the most common subtype. Despite its high prevalence, current diagnostic workflows rely on 5 um-thin haematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) sections, inherently limiting spatial insight into tumor architecture and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. As the interest in studying intratumoral heterogeneity increases, three-dimensional (3D) imaging is becoming an increasingly valuable tool. Methods: This study applied a tissue clearing and imaging pipeline to large formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast and lymph node tissue using IDC samples from Maastricht University Medical Centre+. Deparaffinized samples were processed using a modified MASH protocol. Tissues were labelled with Neutral Red, Eosin Y, Methyl Green, and DAPI. Tissue shrinkage was analysed across all processed samples. Two-photon (2P) microscopy was used to image malignant and non-malignant breast tissue, and matched axillary lymph nodes from a patient with grade I IDC to depths of up to 1000 um via DAPI and second harmonic generation (SHG) channels. Image analysis included assessments of dye penetration, nuclear and collagen content, and fiber orientation using FIJI software. Results: Clearing and staining preserved tissue structure and achieved high transparency across millimetre-scale volumes. 2D surface shrinkage averaged 6.7% (p < 0.001). DAPI signal penetration was consistent with SHG signal profiles up to approximately 600 um of tissue depth. Structures such as terminal ductal lobular units, adipocytes, vasculature, and lymphoid follicles were clearly visualized in 3D. Quantitative and qualitative analysis in grade I IDC tissue revealed regional differences in cell size and shape, collagen content, and fiber coherency, indicating localized early-stage ECM remodelling. Conclusion: This is the first study to apply 2P microscopy with MASH clearing to large FFPE IDC breast and lymph node samples. The protocol enables reproducible high-resolution volumetric imaging and lays the groundwork for future research applications, leading to potential diagnostic applications.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Using behavior-timed optogenetic inhibition in rats performing a lever-release task, we found that DLS inhibition delayed the initiation of forelimb reaching and conditioned lever release and, when delivered during reaching, interrupted execution. Inhibition during reward retrieval impaired locomotion, especially turning, reducing movement speed and resulting in less efficient trajectories. By contrast, inhibition before the nose poke that triggered reward delivery had little effect, despite substantial DLS activity at the nose poke. These effects were accompanied by bidirectional changes in firing rates in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, a basal ganglia output nucleus, and were much weaker when the dorsomedial striatum was perturbed.

The gene tr1 encodes a Helix-Turn-Helix DNA-binding protein that is exclusively expressed during tick infection. Herein, we show that tr1 is essential for A. phagocytophilum survival in ticks and regulates the transcription of other genes necessary to adapt to the arthropod vector. We demonstrate that Tr1 is a DNA-binding protein and recognizes promotors of tick-specific genes in A. phagocytophilum, including secreted effector ateA, alternate components of type IV secretion system (T4SS), and membrane proteins.

Objective: To quantify the impact of paraformaldehyde (PFA) shelf life on thrombus molecular integrity using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) combined with principal component analysis. Methods: Ten pulmonary artery thrombi were fixed in either aged PFA (6 months; n = 6) or freshly prepared 4% PFA (n = 4); an in-vitro plasma clot control received the same fresh PFA. Triplicate ATR-FTIR spectra (400-4000 cm ^-1) were collected and vector-normalized to the Amide I band. ToF-SIMS measurements were performed using a 30 keV Bismuth(III) ion primary ion beam Fixative chemistry was assessed by the carbonyl absorbance at 1700 cm^-1. Results: Freshly fixed thrombi displayed narrow Amide I (~1650 cm^-1) and Amide II (~1540 cm^-1) bands with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR; median 41.8) than aged-PFA samples (18.2; P < .01). Carbonyl absorbance at 1700 cm^-1 was markedly higher in fresh PFA. Aged PFA introduces chemical variances of biological samples in low-mass molecule fragments.

Here, we examine the physiological role of the T6SS in Bacteroides within a gut community derived from wild mice (the WildR microbiome). Using newly developed genetic tools and a strategy for functional replacement of strains within the WildR community, we demonstrate that the WildR isolate B. acidifaciens employs a T6SS to antagonize co-resident Bacteroidales. We also show that loss of T6SS function compromises the long-term maintenance of B. acidifaciens in the community but not its initial colonization, establishing the system as a determinant of strain persistence. The T6SS we identified resides on an integrative and conjugative element (ICE). ICE-seq, a targeted sequencing approach, reveals that the T6SS-ICE is distributed among select Bacteroidales and Muribaculaceae species in the WildR microbiome, between which it appears to be recently exchanged. We also show that transfer of the T6SS-ICE to WildR isolate Phocaeicola vulgatus confers transient colonization benefits in mice, but an eventual fitness cost.

The Vibrio cholerae cytotoxin MakA, a member of the ClyA structural family of -PFTs, exhibits a unique, pH-dependent ability to induce lipid membrane tubulation. This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. We identify the N-terminal histidine residue (His30) of MakA as a critical pH sensor that is indispensable for membrane tubulation but not required for membrane binding and cell lysis. Substitution of His30 with lysine, MakAH30K , abrogated tubulation without affecting membrane insertion, instead triggering aberrant membrane fusion events. Circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis revealed that the MakAH30K substitution attenuates the robust -helical transition observed in wild-type MakA upon lipid membrane binding, providing a molecular explanation for its functional defect. Furthermore, we established that membrane cholesterol contributes to MakA-induced tubulation of lipid membranes, as its absence or mutation of a putative cholesterol-binding motif MakAI236D&I237D abolishes both membrane association and tubule formation. A key implication of our work is the mechanistic uncoupling of membrane tubulation from cytolysis, revealing that MakA can perturb membranes via distinct pathways. These findings define a sophisticated activation mechanism where His30 protonation in the acidic host environment and specific cholesterol binding synergistically drive the conformational change necessary for helical oligomerization and membrane tubulation. We discuss our findings from the viewpoint of possible convergent evolution, where bacterial PFTs like MakA partly may mimic ancient membrane remodelers involved in membrane repair pathways, such as ESCRT-III, but for bacterial fitness in host interactions and pathogenesis.

We aimed to determine how 5-HT shapes intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission in defined neuronal populations of the medial PFC (mPFC).\n\nExperimental ApproachWe performed whole-cell recordings from morphologically and electrophysiologically characterised layer 5 (L5) neurons in rat mPFC. Pyramidal neurons were classified into adaptive-spiking high input resistance (ASH), adaptive-spiking low input resistance (ASL), and regular-spiking (RS) types; interneurons were categorised as non-fast-spiking (nFS), regular-fast-spiking (rFS), and stuttering-fast-spiking (sFS) interneurons. These cell types exhibited distinct membrane properties, firing patterns, and axonal projections. We assessed serotonergic modulation using bath-applied 5-HT and subtype-specific receptor mechanisms.\n\nKey Results5-HT produced divergent postsynaptic responses across pyramidal neuron subtypes: ASH and RS neurons depolarised via 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) activation, whereas ASL neurons exhibited 5-HT1AR-mediated hyperpolarisation. Among interneurons, rFS and sFS cells depolarised through ionotropic 5-HT3ARs, while nFS interneurons were largely unaffected. At the synaptic level, 5-HT suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission between pyramidal neurons via presynaptic 5-HT1BRs, and conversely enhanced GABAergic transmission from FS interneurons via presynaptic 5-HT3ARs.\n\nConclusions & ImplicationsSerotonin exerts bidirectional, cell type-specific serotonergic modulation of local microcircuits that acts to suppress excitation while facilitating inhibition.

The model comprises distinct anatomical stages: three types of mechanoreceptor afferents, the trigeminal ganglion, the brainstem, the thalamic nucleus, and three cortical layers, connected in a feed-forward hierarchy. We demonstrate the model responses to both rodent whisker deflection and human fingertip skin displacement, using information-theoretic analysis, pairwise correlation, and stimulus decoding at each layer. Our results show that tactile information is efficiently encoded and transformed at each stage: stimulus features are represented with high fidelity and reduced redundancy as signals ascend.

This open-source model is the first to include the mechanosensory periphery in a full tactile pathway simulation, enabling researchers to study how perturbations at any stage affect tactile encoding. Moreover, the network is well-suited for deployment on low-power, real-time neuromorphic hardware, facilitating the development of multi-layer signal processing and tactile navigation algorithms.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "We asked whether infant microbiome composition, together with infants' behavioral responses to early maternal unpredictability, can offer novel mechanistic insights into behavioral phenotypic variation in human development. Maternal unpredictability was computed as the entropy rate of transitions among maternal sensory signals during naturalistic mother-infant interaction (n=256 dyads; 2-6 months). Infant visual orienting behavior (VOB) was indexed by infants' simultaneous gaze shifts to and from the mother. Higher maternal unpredictability predicted more frequent VOB shifts, indicating a mature-for-age profile, and longitudinally forecast poorer inhibitory control at 19-28 months. A subgroup of infants with high maternal unpredictability and high VOB had inhibitory control outcomes closer to those of infants who experienced low maternal unpredictability, suggesting VOB strategy might buffer against the effects of high maternal unpredictability. In participants with metagenomic data (n=93), VOB was associated with taxonomic and functional gut microbial profiles along a Bifidobacterium breve to Bifidobacterium longum axis. Neuroactive gene-set enrichment analysis linked VOB to increase in tryptophan synthesis and glutamate synthesis genes. In contrast, maternal unpredictability showed depletions of GABA and tryptophan synthesis in the unique-effects model and, when VOB and the maternal unpredictability by VOB term were included, enrichment of acetate synthesis and quinolinic acid degradation. Notably, the maternal unpredictability by VOB interactions for tryptophan and glutamate were negative, indicating that the VOB-pathway coupling attenuates as unpredictability increases. Together, these findings support a framework in which maternal unpredictability is the environmental challenge, infant VOB expresses the behavioral strategy, and microbial metabolism modulates whether that strategy is biochemically feasible.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

We introduce the Pattern Dissimilarity of Hemispheric Functional Connectivity (PDHC), a multivariate metric that quantifies the pattern-level distance between each individual's left- and right-hemisphere connectivity architecture. In over one thousand adults, PDHC showed high test-retest reliability, cross-atlas robustness, and strong individual specificity. Network analyses indicated that hemispheric similarity is anchored in conserved sensorimotor and subcortical systems, whereas higher-order networks drive divergence. Developmental data from infancy through early adulthood revealed a characteristic trajectory: dissimilarity declines sharply early in life and increases modestly thereafter. Twin and Turner syndrome samples further demonstrated moderate heritability and sensitivity to X-chromosome dosage. PDHC thus provides a reliable and individualized metric of hemispheric functional architecture, offering a scalable tool for probing lateralization across development, genetics, cognition, and clinical conditions.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

While SDs are traditionally thought contributing to the postictal depression and termination of epileptic discharges, seizures may also occur during SDs or may even follow SDs suggesting that interactions between SD and seizures are more complex. Here, we examined the interactions between SD and epileptic activity by spatially separating the epileptic focus and the site of SD initiation. Epileptic focus was induced by local intracortical injection of the potassium channel blocker 4-AP combined with the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine, whereas extrinsic SDs were evoked by distal high potassium application. We found that extrinsic SDs promoted seizure-like events (SLEs) when the SD wave approached the epileptic focus, followed by suppression of epileptic activity when SD spread through the focus. The timing of SLE relatively SD varied at different recordings sites, with SLEs occurring before, during or after SD arrival depending on electrode position along the trajectory of SD propagation between the SD initiation site and the epileptic focus. During intracortical recordings, the proconvulsive effects of SD were associated with a wave of pre-SD neuronal excitation reaching the epileptic focus. The epileptic focus per se also demonstrated a resistance to the SD invasion. Thus, the interactions between SD and epileptic focus are not limited to postictal depression, and SDs may also promote epileptic activity in the hyperexcitable cortex.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

This study uses information from Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and The Virtual Brain (TVB) alongside clinical measures to provide a causal and network-level perspective on MS pathophysiology. We defined a visuomotor network based on previous work, including bilateral primary visual cortex (V1), left primary motor cortex (M1), left supplementary motor and premotor cortex (SMAPMC), left cingulate cortex (CC), left superior parietal lobule (SPL), and right cerebellar lobule VI (CR). We analysed data from 9 healthy volunteers (HV) and 17 people with MS (pwMS) who underwent multimodal MRI including a visually-guided variable grip-force event-related task and resting-state functional MRI, as well as diffusion-weighted imaging. Our DCM analysis indicated that the best-fitting model was the same for both groups, suggesting preserved visuomotor network architecture. However, pwMS showed altered effective connectivity during task (from SPL to M1: excitatory in HV, inhibitory in pwMS) and rest (from V1 to M1: excitatory in HV, inhibitory in pwMS; from SPL to M1, from M1 to SMAPMC, and from CR to V1: inhibitory in HV, excitatory in pwMS). During task execution, grip-force modulations revealed altered feedback connectivity patterns in pwMS as motor demand increased, indicating a shift from the positive coupling seen in HV to negative coupling across most connections. Effective connectivity alterations in task and resting-state fMRI were associated with clinical measures, including disability and motor reaction time. Connectivity changes involved visuomotor and cerebellar circuits and differed between task execution and rest, indicating context-specific network dynamics. Network-level simulations further linked reduced excitatory gain to slower responses, showing the role of excitation/inhibition balance in performing a visuomotor task. Together, these findings identify excitatory and inhibitory alterations as key mechanisms of network functional disruption in MS and demonstrate the potential of multiscale modelling to bridge neurophysiological alterations with clinical performance.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

We subtracted No probe trials from Congruent and Incongruent trials to yield visual evoked potentials (VEPs) free from the influence of prior somatosensory processing. Comparably to prior findings in adults, 8-month-olds' first negative component of the VEP was enhanced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the probe when the visual probe was spatially congruent with the tactile cue.

Seven humans and seven horses participated in a crossover design experiment in which participants viewed either stressful or relaxed video stimuli prior to interacting with horses. Electroencephalography (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV), and salivary cortisol was collected to assess human physiological responses, while the Human-Animal Interaction Scale (HAIS) and an ethogram evaluated interaction quality and horse behaviors. Stressful stimuli significantly increased beta and high-beta activity and altered HRV indices, indicated by increased low-frequency power and decreased high-frequency power. HAIS scores were lower under stress conditions, reflecting reduced interaction quality. Horses exhibited more pushing behavior and less lip-licking when handlers were stressed, although task completion time did not differ between conditions. These results demonstrated that human stress negatively influences both physiological states and behavioral outcomes within human-horse interactions. Therefore, managing emotional states and stress levels may enhance interaction quality and effectiveness in equine-assisted programs.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

We performed a multiyear, multilocation factorial evaluation of GRAIN WIDTH2 (TaGW2) mutants in hexaploid wheat using BC4 near-isogenic lines, sowing-density treatments and semi-dwarfing RHT1 backgrounds. Loss-of-function mutations in TaGW2 increased grain size and thousand grain weight (TGW) additively; with the aaBBDD single mutant showing the most stable single-locus effect, while the aabbdd triple mutant achieved ~20% higher TGW across twelve field trials. However, overall grain yield remained unchanged or slightly reduced, reflecting a compensatory trade-off with grain number. Spike phenotyping of both main and secondary tillers showed comparable increases in TGW and spike yield despite fewer grains per spike, indicating that limited yield gain primarily reflects reduced spike number per unit area rather than decreased spike-level productivity. Effects were stable across sowing densities, whereas interactions with semi-dwarfing alleles were allele-specific: RHT-B1b partially suppressed TGW gains and accentuated yield penalties, whereas RHT-D1b maintained the large-grain phenotype and productivity. Across experiments, the TaGW2-A1D1 double mutant increased TGW (~14%) while maintaining yield stability, identifying it as a promising genotype for breeding. We conclude that TaGW2 is a reliable modifier of grain size but not yield in isolation.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma are key biofluids in AD research. CSF is considered to better reflect brain metabolic alterations than plasma, while plasma can be obtained more easily. However, plasma-CSF relationships are unclear. Aim: To investigate longitudinal changes of amines in plasma and CSF, and their correlation across the two, in male and female TgF344 AD transgenic versus wildtype (WT) rats. Method: LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics was used to analyze 60 and 55 amines in plasma and CSF, respectively, of male and female TgF344-AD and WT rats, at 12, 25, 50 and 85 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed using generalized logistic regressions, Pearson correlations, and differential correlations between groups and matrixes. Results: Compared to WT controls, at 12 weeks, TgF344-AD rats showed an increase of 3-methylhistidine, anserine, cysteine, s-methylcysteine, while at 25 weeks, male TgF344-AD rats showed pronounced increases in CSF levels of alpha-aminobutyric acid, asparagine, glycylglycine, glycylproline, histidine, isoleucine, kynurenine, leucine, methionine, methionine sulfone, norepinephrine, phenylalanine, proline, tyrosine, and valine.

We examined whether a fully deceptive antipsychotic-placebo changes cognition not only by enhancing arousal and attention but also by changing self-representations, namely, by adding that of being under a treatment related to psychosis and by weakening the binding of experience to reality. Drug-naive healthy participants (N = 83) were split into a group (N = 40) who took a pill described as an antipsychotic and a no- pill control group (N = 43). Participants performed a cognitive test (CogTest), that is, a semantic categorization task and a self-referential role judgment task (SRT). Behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. In the CogTest, placebos showed faster response times and higher accuracy than no-pills. This cognitive improvement was associated with more negative occipito-temporal early ERPs (OTEEs), larger central P2s (CentP2s), and larger late positive potentials (LPPs), with the latter correlating with response times. As in the literature, CentP2s were maximal in the SRT, possibly because it maximally stimulates the binding of the stimulus to long-term self-representations. The larger CentP2s and LPPs for placebos than for no-pills in the CogTest were thus tentatively related to the binding of the stimulus with egocentric self-representations, temporarily enriched by the addition of the representation of being on drug. On the contrary, the more negative OTEEs were related to a weaker binding to allocentric ones, preventing a strong binding of experience with reality. The smaller N400s observed for placebos than for no-pills in both tasks were related to greater openness to new experiences.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

This study used functional MRS (fMRS) to investigate whether socially-laden stimuli modulate excitatory or inhibitory neurometabolites, and whether modulation relates to social function. Forty neurotypical adults (18-40 years; 20 male) underwent 3T MRI, with fMRS data acquired using a J-difference edited MRS sequence.

Participants viewed a fixation cross (rest; 5 min), silent video clips of social interaction, and a flashing checkerboard as control stimulus (5 min each; counterbalanced). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) assessed social function. There were no significant differences between resting and functional (social or checkerboard) GABA+ or Glx levels (ps<.05), although Bayesian analyses showed evidence for decreased STG/TPJ GABA+ and increased occipital cortex Glx for checkerboard compared to rest. Higher SRS-2 scores were associated with higher resting STG/TPJ Glx but not GABA+, and functional metabolite levels were not associated with SRS-2 scores (ps>.1).

E.; Karayanidis, F.", "abstract": "Background: Ageing is associated with increased cardiovascular health risks and disproportionate atrophy in frontotemporal brain. Regional cerebral arterial elasticity correlates with regional grey matter volume, with stronger associations frontally and in older adults. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is linked to preserved brain structure and greater arterial elasticity, while sex differences exist in the timing of vascular versus structural changes. This study examines whether regional cerebral arterial elasticity in frontotemporal cortex mediates the association between age and corresponding grey matter volume decline, and whether sex and/or CRF moderate this relationship. Methods: We analysed data from 162 healthy adults (60-70 years) with structural MRI and diffuse optical tomography of the cerebral arterial pulse (Pulse-DOT) from the ACTIVate cohort. CRF was estimated from demographic and physiological measures. Pulse Relaxation Function (PReFx), an optical index of regional arterial elasticity, was measured across 28 frontal, temporal, and parietal regions of interest (ROI). Grey matter (GM) volume was quantified for corresponding ROIs. Mediation and moderated mediation models tested whether PReFx mediated the relationship between age and GM volume at bilateral frontal and temporal ROIs, and whether biological sex or CRF moderated this relationship. Results: Regional bivariate correlations identified associations between age, PReFx and GM volume across multiple ROIs, which PReFx and GM volume being associated primarily in left frontal and temporal areas. PReFx partially mediated the effect of age on GM volume in a left mid-inferior frontal ROI, accounting for approximately 16% of the total age effect and this relationship was only evident in females. Although higher CRF was associated with greater PReFx, it did not moderate the relationship between age, PReFx and GM volume. Conclusions: Consistent with cascade models of neurovascular aging, cerebral arterial stiffening was found to partially explain the effect of increasing age on frontal GM volume, even in this highly age-restricted and high functioning cohort. This effect was only significant over the left prefrontal cortex, consistent with greater vulnerability of frontal brain and associated cognitive functions. It was also exclusively present in females, who had better cardiovascular health, larger grey matter volume and greater arterial elasticity than males. These findings are consistent with pulse-DOT measures of cerebral arterial elasticity being more sensitive to subclinical brain structural variability.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Brain encoding and decoding models from naturalistic stimuli provide a powerful window into semantic representations. Yet, existing approaches rely on a constrained scanning environment, or on conventional fNIRS, which has been limited to sparse sampling and/or block-design paradigms. Here, we tested whether high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), an advanced high-density tomographic optical imaging method, can support semantic encoding and decoding using naturalistic movies. We collected 3.5 hours of naturalistic movie viewing data from six participants using stimuli labeled with 1,708 categories. Encoding models robustly predicted voxel-level responses, yielding single semantic category maps consistent with prior fMRI studies. In complementary decoding analyses, we showed that DOT responses captured sufficient semantic content to identify which clips participants viewed. To assess organization across individuals, we identified a shared low-dimensional semantic space that captures common semantic dimensions. Finally, clustering analyses revealed interpretable higher-order semantic dimensions like social and animate agents, objects vs natural organisms, and textural scenes, consistently mapped across the cortex. These findings demonstrate that DOT can recover distributed, high-dimensional semantic representations from naturalistic movies, bridging fMRI-level semantic mapping with the accessibility of optical imaging.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

In this study, I use a multimodal large language model (Gemini) as an automated \"semantic annotator\" to bridge naturalistic movie stimuli, brain responses, and cognitive performance. Using the Human Connectome Project movie-watching dataset, I segmented the film into 293 overlapping clips, prompted Gemini to rate each clip on 11 psychologically interpretable dimensions, and simultaneously extracted clip-wise BOLD activation patterns from the fMRI images in 360 cortical parcels. In this way, the AI and the brain effectively \"watch\" the same movies in parallel. For each parcel, I then fit linear regression models to predict clip-to-clip variation in movie-evoked responses from these features. Gemini-derived features robustly predicted movie-evoked responses in temporal, medial parietal, and lateral frontal association cortex, but explained little variance in unimodal somatosensory, dorsal parietal, insular, and piriform regions. Feature-weight maps recapitulated known functional specializations, and features with the largest global influence overlapped with the most explainable parcels. Partial least squares analysis revealed that individual differences in resting-state connectivity strength and semantic explainability covaried along an asymmetric intrinsic axis: strongly integrated sensory-opercular systems at rest were associated with poorer AI predictability, whereas a smaller set of dorsal and medial association regions showed enhanced alignment. Finally, regional AI explainability in medial parietal and left perisylvian association areas was positively related to fluid and crystallized cognitive abilities. Together, these findings demonstrate that prompt-defined, interpretable features from foundation models provide a simple and scalable framework for quantifying brain-AI alignment in naturalistic settings, offering a practical bridge between biological and artificial semantic representations.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we used a human neural organoid model - brain microphysiological system (bMPS), derived from nine induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to model the impact of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent non-aromatizable androgen. All lines differentiated reproducibly into electrically active, neuron-glia-oligodendrocyte organoids expressing robust androgen-signaling components. DHT was bioavailable, elicited nuclear androgen receptor (AR) translocation and increased organoid size in most cell lines, consistent with androgen-responsive mTOR and metabolic pathway activation. Bulk RNA-seq across nine lines revealed that transcriptional responses varied across donor backgrounds, but DHT-responsive genes converged on mitochondrial energetics, lysosomal function, glycoprotein processing, apoptosis, and mTOR signaling. Cell-type expression profiling showed an androgen-driven shift primarily in male lines toward astrocytic profiles with reductions in oligodendrocyte, oligodendrocyte progenitor (OPC), excitatory, and inhibitory neuronal signatures, supported by immunohistochemistry and AR enrichment in astrocytes and OPCs. DHT also altered neurodevelopmental pathways, increasing variation in synaptic pruning and decreasing variation in neuronal migration, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis and seizure status of donors moderating these effects more strongly than sex. Baseline transcriptional differences distinguished iPSC lines which responded more strongly to DHT from weak responders: responders displayed enhanced synaptic maturity and reduced ECM gene expression. Using isogenic XX/XY lines, we found that differences in sex-chromosome expression exceeded DHT-induced changes and that DHT decreased expression of inhibitory neuron genes in males and increased it in females.

W.; Roberts, A.; Siggins, C.; Erwin, Z.; Maynard, T.; LaMantia, A.-S.", "abstract": "We characterized cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic response in vitro and in vivo to the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), which in the LgDel 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome mouse model restores growth and connectivity of upper layer cortical projection neurons (Layer 2/3 PNs) and improves cognitive performance. NAC treatment of primary cultured LgDel L 2/3 PNs does not restore these neurons to a wild type (WT) state. Rather than returning to the bimodal dendrite and axon size distribution seen in WT, LgDel L 2/3 PN dendrite and axon growth in vitro increases unimodally in response to NAC. In parallel, altered expression of 22q11-deleted genes and presumed downstream targets are unchanged. Instead, novel antioxidant defense and neuronal growth genes are differentially expressed: some generally NAC-regulated, others responsive only in the context of 22q11 deletion. Apparently, NAC ameliorates L 2/3 PN developmental pathology without restoring WT cell states or typical expression of mutant genes or their downstream targets. NAC also elicits differential expression of antioxidant defense genes in 22q11-deleted L 2/3 PNs--but not L 5/6 counterparts--in the developing postnatal LgDel mouse cortex, rather than modulating 22q11 genes or downstream targets. These NAC-dependent, L 2/3 PN-selective in vivo cellular and transcriptional changes differ substantially from those in primary culture. Thus, despite some in vitro and in vivo parallels, the NAC therapeutic response that diminishes oxidative stress-related L 2/3 PN circuit and behavioral pathology due to 22q11 deletion has a unique in vivo signature.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

The striatum is a critical brain center for both movement and learning, and its dysfunction underlies numerous movement disorders. Whereas activity in the striatum has been classically viewed as invigorating and reinforcing movements, recent studies suggest that striatal activity encodes specific movements. However, it is not known how granular this activity is, and if it indeed controls specific ongoing movements. We designed a task where mice performed two minimally-different forelimb actions, consisting of a push or pull isometric force on an immobile joystick, and imaged the activity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsolateral striatum using 2-photon microscopy. We observed that striatal activity encoded both the preparation and execution of specific actions, even when those actions were not reinforced. Furthermore, both populations of D1 and D2-MSNs - classically viewed as promoting versus inhibiting movement - equally encoded action identity. We developed a closed-loop system to model and stimulate action-specific neural ensembles deep in the brain, using holographic optogenetics through a GRIN lens. Stimulation of action-specific ensembles of both D1- and D2-MSNs increased the force of ongoing actions, but only when the ensemble stimulated was congruent with the ongoing action. These results reveal that specific ensembles of both D1- and D2-MSNs causally control specific ongoing actions, as granular as different muscle co-contractions of the same forelimb. Such granularity provides a mechanistic framework for understanding how striatal dysfunction can produce highly specific movement impairments in Huntington's disease and dystonia.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Habituation is an early-developing cognitive process linked to early learning whereby irrelevant stimuli are filtered out; it can be assessed using neuroimaging tools, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, conventional fNIRS analysis approaches typically assume linear time invariance and analyse summary statistics of the data, potentially limiting insight into the nature of the changing evoked haemodynamic response. Functional data analysis (FDA) is a branch of statistics which treats entire mathematical functions as the unit of analysis rather than discrete points; within this framework, functional change point (FCPt) detection can identify significant changes in data structure, such as the mean haemodynamic response function. Using infant fNIRS data from a rural Gambian population (n= 204) recorded using a habituation and novelty detection paradigm, the use of functional change point detection with wild binary segmentation was implemented to identify structural changes in the evoked haemodynamic response. Group-level analysis from participants assessed at 5-, 8- and 12mo of age identified structural change corresponding to the evoked haemodynamic response in locations consistent with previous analyses. Further analyses indicated consistent habituation at 8- and 12mo and an age-related shift in the timing of decreasing haemodynamic responses, suggesting older infants in the first year of life habituate more rapidly to auditory stimuli. These results provide novel evidence to support the use of FDA and FCPt detection in the fNIRS field more widely, as well as improving understanding of the development of habituation during early infancy.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Most research on chromatin dynamics during the cell cycle has primarily focused on events surrounding mitosis, providing only limited insight into chromatin behavior during S-phase. To address this gap, we developed a simple, drug-free approach that combines the Fucci cell-cycle indicator with in situ Hi-C to comprehensively analyze A/B compartment dynamics throughout interphase in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Unexpectedly, and contrary to prevailing views, we found that A/B compartment strength increased abruptly upon S-phase entry, stabilized during S-phase, and subsequently declined in late S/G2. This abrupt strengthening, which we termed  compartment maturation, required passage through the G1/S transition but was independent of active DNA synthesis. This maturation involved substantial architectural remodeling, particularly within the A compartment, which consolidated into a more organized structure as individual A domains rearranged to form long-range interactions. Moreover, compartment maturation was not limited to mESCs but was also observed across different developmental contexts in mice. Based on these observations, we propose a revised, stepwise model of nuclear compartmentalization during cell-cycle progression, consisting of four distinct stages: chromosome unfolding (G1), chromatin maturation (G1/S), stabilization (S phase), and refolding (G2). These findings reveal the unexpected plasticity of A/B compartments and underscore the G1/S transition as a critical period for their reorganization.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

We discovered that mitochondrial material is dispersed asymmetrically throughout the cell via biased anterograde transport from the perinuclear area.

By modelling olfactory training in mice, we found that odor exposure triggers quiescent neural stem cells of the olfactory epithelium to re-enter the cell cycle, enhancing neurogenesis and survival of olfactory sensory neurons. Coupling neuronal activity with stem cells proliferation, these effects scaled with odor concentration and were replicated without odorants upon chemogenetic activation of olfactory sensory neurons.

However, apnull flies are associated with another phenotype whose analysis was largely neglected in the past 40 years: adults die precociously 2-3 days after eclosion. We have recently published a comprehensive analysis on the physiology of this striking phenotype. We showed that Ap protein is essential early in metamorphosis during hindgut remodeling where it is required for rectal papillae formation in the rectal ampulla. Wild-type flies have four rectal papillae that are involved in selective reabsorption of essential ions and metabolites from the primary urine produced by the Malpighian tubules. In apnull flies, rectal papillae formation is aborted prematurely. The corresponding papillar cells remain stuck in the rectal lumen. This leads to complete intestinal blockage and a cascade of pathologies resulting in premature death. In this study, we genetically identify and functionally dissect a novel tissue specific cis- regulatory element that directs Ap expression in the hindgut. This Life Span Enhancer (apLSE) maps to a [~]400 bp DNA fragment that is activated via only two small regulatory modules. Genetic analysis of apLSE alleles proves that they are essential for papilla formation and thus for adult survival. Our studies solve the 110-year-old enigma about the ap syndrome. They establish the apLSE as a key player linking hindgut morphogenesis and survival. We propose that several aspects of the ap syndrome are a consequence of drastic changes in endocrine homeostasis.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Phenotypic selection has improved yield and lodging tolerance but has limited genetic insights. We show how specific genomic variants and their combinations underpin advances in modern rice breeding in Japan. Through genome-wide association study using a multi-parent advanced-generation intercross population derived from four temperate japonica cultivars, we identified 11 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for key agronomic traits, including days to heading, shoot biomass, panicle length, and culm length under field conditions. GA20ox1, GA20ox2, and Hd1 were among the QTLs, and their natural variants were well conserved in temperate japonica cultivars bred in Japan, underscoring distinct selection pressures at these loci. By integrating genotype data with 5-year yield-performance-evaluation trials of elite cultivars, we found that cultivars carrying multiple-copy GA20ox1 and functional Hd1, together with non-functional ga20ox2, tended to have shorter culms and higher grain yield than cultivars with multiple-copy GA20ox1, functional Hd1, and GA20ox2. This yield advantage was consistent across latitudes in Japan. These results reveal favorable genotype combinations underlying modern japonica improvement and provide a genomic framework for breeding semi-dwarf, high-yielding cultivars adapted to temperate rice-growing regions in Asia.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

These risks may stem from adaptations optimizing reward pursuit in anticipation of unreliable, resource poor environments. One rational adaptation to poor, unreliable environments is Behavioral Opportunism: updating expectations more slowly and acting vigorously only when reward is immediately available. To systematically test the impact of ELA on behavioral strategies and underlying reward processing mechanisms, we exposed mice to resource restriction (limited bedding and nesting materials for 7 days) to manipulate the reliability and quality of early life care. Subsequently, we tested reward learning and decision making in a two-arm bandit task and recorded dopamine signaling using dLight1.2 fiber photometry in the nucleus accumbens core in adulthood. Exposure to ELA led to poorer choice discrimination, impaired learning, and decreased adaptation to changes in reward availability. Furthermore, ELA mice were slower to choose between levers but were faster to retrieve immediately available rewards when delivered, consistent with a strategy of behavioral opportunism. Dopamine signaling predicted behavior in both rearing conditions, and its fluctuations were strongly predictive of faster retrieval in ELA mice and an increased likelihood of choice repetition, implying that aberrant dopamine signals underlie slowed learning and vigorous action for immediately available rewards. To understand key features of maternal interactions driving these effects, we used home cage video monitoring to quantify maternal behaviors, continuously, across early life. We found that specific experiential outcomes, such as maternal kicking, intensified behavioral opportunism in adults, predicting poorer bandit task performance beyond the group effect of ELA. Behavioral opportunism provides an explanatory framework for interpreting altered reward processing and reward pursuit in adulthood for individuals exposed to ELA.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Using fMRI and eye-tracking during a two-hour movie (n=12), we examined spontaneous gaze shifts during low versus high visual saliency periods. During low-saliency periods, when inter-individual variability was greatest, we found that visual features of upcoming gaze targets 2 seconds before eye movements could be predicted by right temporo-parieto-occipital junction (R-TPOJ) activity. Critically, the strength of connectivity between R-TPOJ and the right superior parietal lobule, which predicts gaze position, correlated with gaze-shift frequency during low-saliency periods. These findings suggest that R-TPOJ specifies the next scene content prior to foveation, and that eye movements serve to align this internally specified content with external stimuli, thereby shaping individual differences during movie-watching.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Varied blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI) acquisitions have been used to examine the functional roles of this system, but these acquisitions have substantial limitations, such as the need for specialized hardware and long acquisition times, and they typically rely on group averaging of activation patterns. In recent years, whole-brain multi-echo (ME) fMRI techniques have been used to reduce artifacts and scan times, map entire sensory systems, and improve sensitivity to neural activity in both resting-state and task fMRI data acquired at 3T. Combined with dense-sampling strategies, these ME techniques have facilitated precision mapping of neural activity in individual subjects. Thus, in this technical note we propose the use of a commonly available ME whole-brain acquisition and ME denoising approaches to examine the auditory system in both group and densely sampled single-subject datasets. Whole-brain and region-specific analyses were performed to identify auditory regions of activation. At the group level, auditory activation was identified bilaterally in cortical regions and unilaterally in cerebellar lobules VIIb/VIIIa with both analyses. Additionally, the region-specific analysis successfully identified unilateral activation in thalamic and brainstem regions. At the individual subject-level, precision mapping combined with ME denoising methods enhanced sensitivity, yielding bilateral activation in cortical, cerebellar, thalamic, and brainstem regions with both analyses. Lastly, we demonstrate the benefits of using multi-echo methods and a whole-brain precision mapping approach to better align an individual's functional response to their specific anatomy.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

In this study, we focused on Hakai, a methyltransferase writer-associated protein whose molecular function within the complex and link to CRC immune regulation remain poorly characterized. Methods: We performed RNA-seq to assess transcriptomic changes after Hakai silencing in CRC models and MeRIP-seq to profile methylation alterations. Validation was carried out by Western blot, flow cytometry, ELISA, and RT-qPCR. Protein interactions within the writer complex were analysed by co-immunoprecipitation, and changes in protein localization by cell fractionation assays. Peripheral blood from healthy donors and lamina propria mononuclear cells from CRC patients were incubated with supernatants from Hakai-silenced CRC cells to evaluate effects on immune responses. Results: Hakai silencing induced phenotypic changes in both monolayer and 3D CRC cultures, while its impact on the global transcriptome was limited. However, significant alterations in the methylation of immune response-related genes and reduced total mA levels were observed. Hakai interacted with the writer-associated protein VIRMA, and its silencing altered the subcellular localization of METTL3. Moreover, conditioned media from Hakai-silenced CRC cells modulated the expression of immune response markers in patient-derived gut immune cells. Conclusions: Hakai acts as a component of the mA writer complex in CRC cells, influencing RNA methylation and the expression of immune-related genes.

We aimed to compare the disuse-induced changes in the phenotype and proteome of the calf and thigh muscles, and to assess the extent to which these proteomic changes are regulated at the mRNA and other levels. Twelve healthy young males participated in 3-week bed rest. Disuse resulted in a greater decrease in lean mass, aerobic performance, and changes in the proteome and transcriptome of the calf muscles/m. soleus than the thigh muscles/m. vastus lateralis. A greater decrease in calf muscle mass was related to a decrease in the expression/deactivation of translation regulators, but not to the expression of the main sarcomeric proteins. At the same time, a significant decrease in aerobic performance of the ankle plantar flexors occurred without changing the expression of oxidative enzymes - a marker of mitochondrial density. That decrease was associated with dysregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Most large-scale changes in the transcriptome did not translate into changes in the proteome, suggesting a redundancy in regulation at the mRNA levels. However, changes in the RNA levels were revealed to play a dominant role in regulating specific proteins, whereas for others, this factor played little or no role. In conclusion, our findings partially explain why calf muscles with a strong postural function are more sensitive to short-term disuse. This provides a foundation for developing targeted approaches to counteract the negative effects of disuse on different muscles.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Male double-hit rats exhibited robust schizophrenia-like behaviors, reduced parvalbumin (PV), OTX2, and perineuronal net (PNN) expression, decreased GAD67 levels, and increased DNA damage in PV interneurons, together indicating impaired inhibitory maturation and weakened plasticity. In contrast, females showed milder behavioral deficits but displayed increased PV and OTX2 intensities, enhanced cFos activation in excitatory neurons, and transcriptomic upregulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and synapse assembly pathways, suggesting a state of heightened or dysregulated plasticity. Despite these divergent molecular trajectories, in vivo electrophysiology revealed a shared functional endpoint in both sexes: a shift from paired-pulse inhibition to facilitation during basolateral amygdala-evoked responses, reflecting impaired GABAB-mediated inhibitory feedback. Pharmacological blockade of GABAB, but not GABAA, receptors reproduced this phenotype, identifying GABAB signaling as a key mechanism underlying cortical disinhibition.

In part, MS results in loss of normal autonomic activity that contributes to disease-associated pathology such as neurogenic bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. Yet little is known of the impacts of MS on peripheral autonomic neurons that directly innervate these target organs. In this study, we measured changes in properties of neurons of the mouse major pelvic ganglion (MPG) associated with two different levels of severity in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Our data show that bladder function and physiological properties of MPG neurons are altered in association with EAE, and differ between less and more severe clinical scores associated with disease progression. EAE results in decreased bladder function measured by decreased urine output and increased micturition pressures. In the most severely affected animals, action potentials (APs) show increased half-widths as a result of decreased maximum decay slopes leading to overall broader and longer APs and lower maximum firing frequency. These changes in AP properties are associated with differences in ion channel subunit expression as well. KCNA1-4, KCNN3, SCN2A1 and SCN3A mRNA levels in MPGs decreased with disease severity. Taken together, our data indicate that peripheral autonomic neurons are fundamentally altered in EAE, suggesting that longer-term therapeutic approaches for MS could target these neurons directly to potentially help ameliorate neurogenic target organ dysfunction.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

N.; Shoup, A.; Shadmehr, R.", "abstract": "We tend to think of neurons as either excitatory or inhibitory, but certain neurons chemically inhibit their downstream targets while electrically exciting their neighbors. For example, in the cerebellum, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) inhibit Purkinje cells (P-cells) via release of GABA but promote spiking in each other via gap junctions. What is gained by having an inhibitory neuron excite its neighbor? Here, we recorded activities of P-cells and MLIs as marmosets performed saccadic eye movements and found that spike timing in pairs of neighboring neurons of the same type exhibited a mathematical regularity: as firing rates increased, rate of spikes that were within 1ms of each other grew disproportionately while 2-4ms intervals were suppressed. To uncover the purpose of this coordination, during saccades we recorded thousands of neuron triplets in which two MLIs converged onto a single target P-cell. When the MLIs spiked within 1ms of each other, they produced superposition of their individual effects on their target; a deep inhibition followed by a post-inhibitory rebound. However, when the MLIs spiked 2-4ms apart, the two spikes interfered with each other, producing partial cancellation. Thus, electrical coupling between inhibitory neurons orchestrated their spike timing so that as firing rates increased, the temporal intervals that induced downstream superposition were promoted while the intervals that caused interference were suppressed.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

B.; Alamia, A.", "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the spatiotemporal dynamics of oscillatory brain activity. Recordings at various scales have shown oscillations propagating as waves over cortical space, both at small and large scales. The most common waves observed in the EEG are planar waves, formed by a synchronized wavefront propagating in a consistent direction (e.g., posterior-anterior). These waves have been linked to diverse perceptual and cognitive measures. However, their quantification has faced issues due to the inherently noisy EEG signal and its ambiguous spatial localization. Existing methods employ restrictive windows of analysis (e.g., lines of electrodes) or rely on wave motifs extracted from the data. A specific algorithm for detecting planar waves is still lacking. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis pipeline for this purpose, comprising three steps: first, genuine oscillatory activity is extracted from the EEG as clusters. The spatial phase gradient is then fit using a spherical wave model. Finally, stable waves are extracted from the time series of fits. We validate our method using simulations over a physiological range of parameters. Using a forward model, we test EEG wave detection for propagation along different pathways at the source level. Lastly, we apply our analysis to real EEG recordings, targeting alpha oscillations during visual stimulation and at rest. In summary, our method provides a reliable algorithm for detecting planar waves in the EEG. Given the emerging functional roles of traveling waves in perception and cognition, this could potentially be utilized in a wide range of future studies.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

F.; Benoit, J. B.; Chiurillo, M. A.; Lander, N.", "abstract": "Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling is crucial for environmental sensing and response to stress conditions in trypanosomatids. However, the mechanisms driving the specificity of cAMP signals remain poorly understood in these protozoan parasites. We recently identified two putative cAMP microdomains in Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Here, considering the localization of three phosphodiesterases, PDEC at the contractile vacuole complex (CVC), and PDEB1 and PDEB2 along the flagellum, we modulated their expression to functionally characterize the flagellar tip (FT) and the CVC as individual cAMP microdomains, named FT-cAMP and CVC-cAMP, respectively. We generated PDE knockout and overexpression cell lines to selectively alter cAMP signals generated in each compartment. Our results indicate that FT-cAMP mediates cell adhesion, metacyclogenesis, host cell invasion, and intracellular replication, while CVC-cAMP is required for osmoregulation and epimastigote proliferation. In addition, ablation of flagellar PDEB1 and PDEB2 enhanced the parasites ability to colonize the hindgut of the triatomine vector, whereas PDEC-KO parasites were impaired in their establishment in the insects hindgut. The observed phenotypes were compartment-specific, demonstrating functional segregation between the two cAMP microdomains. Our data provide robust evidence on the presence of compartmentalized cAMP signals in T. cruzi, linking the role of locally synthesized cAMP pools to specific cellular responses during the parasites life cycle.\n\nAuthor summaryChagas disease is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is spread through the feces of infected kissing bugs. The parasite survives in challenging environments as it transitions between the insect vector and the mammalian host by differentiating into distinct developmental forms. cAMP is a universal second messenger that mediates specific cellular processes in the life cycle of T. cruzi. However, the spatial-temporal dynamics of cAMP signal remain largely unexplored in trypanosomes. We previously reported several cAMP signaling proteins in two compartments of T. cruzi: the contractile vacuole complex (CVC) and the flagellar tip (FT). In this study, we characterized the individual functions of these microdomains. We specifically disturbed cAMP signaling in these compartments by modulating the expression of their resident phosphodiesterases. We observed that the FT microdomain is specifically involved in parasite differentiation, host cell invasion, intracellular replication, and vector colonization, while the CVC microdomain is important for osmoregulation and parasite survival within the kissing bug. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that T. cruzi utilizes specific cAMP pools to address different environmental challenges. These findings highlight cAMP signaling as an essential pathway that could be further explored for the development of novel antiparasitic interventions.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Independent of mechano-electrical transduction (MET), whether Gq protein-coupled receptor (GqPCR) signaling participate in the regulation of intracellular calcium dynamics and induce neuronal transmitter release in hair cells remains unknown. We screened mechanosensitive GqPCRs in VHCs and found that a Class C GPCR, metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu2), is expressed in kinocilia and is essential for normal balance. Notably, the dispensable role of mGlu2 in normal hearing is consistent with absent of mature kinocilia in cochlea hair cells. Different from the conventional mGlu2-Gi signaling, the sensing of mechanical signals by mGlu2 activates the Gq-PLCD4 pathway, increases intracellular calcium concentration and promotes neurotransmitter release in VHCs. Hair cell-specific deficiency of either Grm2 or Gnaq, or knockdown of Plcd4 expression, but not deficiency of another GqPCR Gpr68, causes significant balance deficits. Reintroduction of mGlu2 into the VHCs of Pou4f3-CreER+/- Grm2fl/fl mice restore vestibular functions.

Here we show that Sfc1 directly interacts with the Tim23 and succinate affects this interaction, which in turn affects mitochondrial protein import. Physical interaction between Tim23 and Sfc1 was proven by co immunoprecipitation, Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) and Biotin-based proximity labeling (TurboID).

There are currently no clinical treatments or cures for prion disease. Current challenges in the development of prion therapeutics include prion strain specificity, which can cause the emergence of drug-resistant prions, and lack of efficacy in treating human prions despite promising results in rodent models. Here we identify a novel therapeutic target for prion disease: the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. The OST complex is responsible for transferring the mature glycan to the acceptor polypeptide during Nglycosylation. We found that inhibiting OST effectively treats rodent prions in various dividing and non-dividing cell types. Importantly, we also demonstrate efficacy in treating human sCJD prions in non-dividing cerebral organoids. Inhibition of OST results in a 50% reduction in cell surface expression of the prion protein, PrPC. In addition, lysates of cells treated with the OST inhibitor NGI-1 were unable to amplify PrPSc seeds in Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) reactions. In summary, our results identify OST as a novel therapeutic target that regulates both the abundance of cell surface PrPC as well as its ability to convert into multiple strains of PrPSc, including human prions, in various in vitro systems.\n\nAuthor SummaryPrion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, are fatal brain disorders caused when a normal protein (PrPC) misfolds into a harmful form that spreads through the brain. There are no effective treatments, and drug development has been hampered by \"strain\" differences in prions that can lead to resistance and by therapies that work in rodents but not in humans. This study identifies a new treatment target: the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, a cellular machine that adds sugar groups to proteins. Blocking OST with a small molecule (NGI1) limited prion growth in multiple types of rodent cells, including non-dividing cells, and-- critically--also worked against human sporadic CJD prions in laboratory-grown human brain organoids. OST inhibition cut the amount of normal prion protein on cell surfaces in half, reducing the raw material available to convert into the disease-causing form. In addition, extracts from NGI-1-treated cells could no longer drive prion formation in a sensitive lab amplification test.\n\nThese results suggest that targeting OST may offer a new strategy that works across different prion strains, including human ones.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

In addition to its beta cell proliferative and regenerative effects, harmine also induces expression of transcription factors and other genes involved in beta cell differentiation and function, exemplified by PDX1, MAFA, NKX6.1, GLP1R, PCSK1 and many others. Harmine also rapidly enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo, reversing diabetes within days in diabetic mice transplanted with a marginal mass of human islets. We had assumed that this pro-differentiation or pro-function effect was a common feature of all DYRK1A inhibitors, and was mediated by DYRK1A inhibition. Thus, DYRK1A is a primary target (we refer to it as Target 1) for harmine. Here, to our surprise, we report that the pro-differentiation effect is not a generalized action for all small molecule DYRK1A inhibitors and does not result from DYRK1A interference or genetic silencing. Instead, the pro- differentiation effect is restricted to a small select subset of DYRK1A inhibitors (harmine, 2-2c and 5-IT). Remarkably, the pro-differentiation effect results from the unique ability of these drugs to activate protein kinase A (PKA), a dual mechanism that distinguishes this class from other DYRK1A inhibitors. The beneficial effects of harmine on PKA appear to be indirect, driven by an as yet unidentified, Target 2 in the PKA pathway. These findings make it clear that all DYRK1A inhibitors are not interchangeable, and that those that drive both proliferation and differentiation/function will likely be preferable in human clinical therapeutic settings.

The impact of IL-13-driven inflammation, common in pediatric asthma, on airway epithelial antiviral and inflammatory responses to RV remain unclear. Objective: Determine how IL-13-driven T2 inflammation modulates pediatric bronchial epithelial cell responses to RV infection. Methods: Bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) were collected from children with (n=50) and without (n=11) asthma. They were differentiated at an air-liquid interface for 21 days, pretreated with IL-13 (10ng/mL) for 7 days to model T2 inflammation, then infected with RV-A16 (MOI 0.5). RNA sequencing of BECs was performed prior to and on days 2, 4, 7, and 10 post infection. Linear and generalized additive models partnered with pathway analysis identified differentially expressed gene clusters. Results: RV infection, IL-13 stimulation, and their interaction each induced differentially expressed genes (7,808; 10,251; and 7,095 genes, respectively; FDR<0.05). IL-13 pretreatment did not alter RV load or a cluster enriched for interferon response and regulation genes, including IFNB1, IFNL1-3, STAT1/2, and CXCL10/11. In contrast, IL-13 reduced expression of distinct antiviral effectors (e.g. MX1/2, RSAD2, IFITM1-3; FDR=1.85 x 10-4) and increased a secondary proinflammatory response cluster enriched for IL-15, TNF, ER stress, and cell-death pathways (FDR=3.63 x 10-6). These clusters correlated with viral load in RV-infected cells, but IL-13 pretreatment eliminated those associations. Conclusions: IL-13 does not modify viral load or interferon induction but selectively suppresses epithelial antiviral effector programs and enhances secondary inflammatory pathways during RV infection.

Seven SRM sites were selected to be part of the Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 179. The MonASPA project has established an environmental monitoring program to evaluate the effectiveness of the management plan approved by the Antarctic Treaty System for these areas. A key component of MonASPA is the long-term monitoring of microbial biodiversity using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. To ensure consistent operation over decades, we developed the Reproducible Amplicon Sequencing Pipeline for Antarctic Monitoring (RASPAM), which is built on Apptainer containers and Nextflow workflows. RASPAM implements Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) and Zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (ZOTUs) to provide high-resolution taxonomic affiliation. It incorporates, in addition to the SILVA database, a taxonomically curated 16S rRNA database for cyanobacteria and enables comparisons against NCBI databases to facilitate the identification of rare prokaryotic strains in environmental samples. RASPAM is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) and represents a robust tool for long-term monitoring of microbial communities in Antarctic and other extreme environments.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Such variability may arise from genetic differences, environmental influences, or the presence of distinct disease endotypes. Longitudinal transcriptomic profiles collected in phase 2a/2b studies provide a unique opportunity not only to investigate drug-induced biological mechanisms in humans, but also to understand why certain individuals fail to respond and to uncover previously unrecognized disease endotypes, ultimately informing the development of targeted therapeutics. However, analyzing these datasets is challenged by substantial patient heterogeneity, variability in disease severity at each visit, and the coarse temporal resolution due to sparse sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce a classification-guided autoencoder framework that jointly optimizes gene-expression reconstruction and classification objective to learn disease-relevant sample embeddings. Sample embeddings from all patients are leveraged to establish a continuous representation of disease dynamics, which can be clustered to delineate discrete disease states. We then construct a patient-sample graph in the learned latent space and apply a multi-commodity-flow based algorithm to infer patient trajectories through these states, enabling the identification of different patient trajectories. We evaluated our approach on three interventional datasets - ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis, each containing both responders and non-responders. The method recapitulates known pathway perturbations associated with anti-IL17 and anti-IL6 therapies, identifies intermediate states reflecting disease/treatment progression, and reveals biologically meaningful patient trajectories within the patient population.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Group 3 MB (G3MB) has poor overall survival at <50%, high frequencies of metastases, and no targeted therapies. Amplification of MYC and activation of TGF{beta} signaling occur frequently in G3MB. Many tumors have no reported mutations, suggesting epigenetic drivers. We here describe novel humanized models for G3MB from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). By transducing hiPSC-derived neuroepithelial stem cells (NESC), we determined that: 1) both MYC and TGF{beta} effectors drove tumors in vivo, 2) MYC/TGF{beta}R1 in combination led to more aggressive tumors and resistance to clinical inhibitors of TGF{beta}, and 3) NESC-derived tumors clustered with human G3MB. To decipher mechanisms, we integrated RNA-sequencing with CUT&RUN (for MYC genomic localization and post-translational modification of histones). MYC-bound neural developmental genes were repressed in MYC/TGF{beta}R1 co-driven lines. Gene signatures associated with the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) demarcated with H3K27me3; the histone mark directly regulated by PRC. We identified JARID1B, a MYC binding partner and H3K4me3 demethylase, as a regulator of repressed neural genes. Primary G3MB also showed increased levels of H3K27me3 concurrent with higher expression of JARID1B. Knockdown of JARID1B in human G3MB cell lines reduced growth, supporting potential as a therapeutic target. We conclude that a MYC-TGF{beta}-JARID1B axis represses target genes to drive G3MB and present new humanized models for G3MB to understand epigenetic dysregulation in G3MB.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

However, counterintuitively, the measure of worker sensitivity to changes in temperature, as assessed by the instantaneous Q10 value (i.e., the rate of change across 10C temperature intervals), shows that large ants are more sensitive than small ants to changes in temperature in terms of both water loss and metabolic rate.

In this study, we reprogrammed the sugar donor specificity of a steroidal rhamnosyltransferase (UGT93M3) to enable the transfer of arabinofuranose (Araf). Through structural analysis, we identified key amino acid residues (368H/Q) that play an important role in determining Araf donor specificity.

To address challenges related to donor availability, we introduced UDP-sugar biosynthetic modules (UDP-Rha and UDP-Araf) into yeast. With this integrated platform, we were able to de novo produce a range of paris saponins, including diosgenin-3-O-glucosyl-(1[-&gt;]6)-glucoside (DGG), diosgenin-3-O-rhamnosyl(1[-&gt;]2) [glucosyl(1[-&gt;]6)]glucoside (DRGG) and paris saponin .

Seven guide RNAs targeting essential genes involved in cell cycle progression, ribosome function, and DNA replication were first assessed by using electroporation as delivery and demonstrated strong lethality for guides targeting CDC28 and MCM2. When delivered by conjugation, these guides again reproduced these results, whereas an intron-targeting control remained non-lethal. Dual-guide plasmids eliminated yeast colony formation entirely.

Thermodynamic principles impose fundamental constraints on metabolism, and the Gibbs free energy change of reaction ({Delta}_r G) indicates the reaction direction and distance from equilibrium.

Here, we mapped {Delta}_r G^' profile of glucose metabolism in mouse liver during fasting, using experimentally measured absolute metabolite concentrations and a newly developed computational method, GLEAM. We found that despite large metabolite fluctuations during fasting, the corresponding {Delta}_r Gs remained robust, even for reactions reversing the direction between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. A remarkable thermodynamic robustness is found in maintaining potential candidates of rate-limiting steps during fasting. This robustness is achieved by expending substantial costs for enzyme expressions, contributing to efficient switching from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis.

Individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions like autism, ADHD, and intellectual/learning disabilities frequently experience both significant sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Although a link between these domains is established, it is unclear whether this relationship and its functional impact are consistent across different neurodevelopmental conditions. In a cross-sectional dataset of individuals aged 5-21 (n = 212), we investigated whether the interplay between sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours differs between individuals diagnosed with autism (IQ>70), ADHD, a learning disability (IQ<70), as well as typically developed controls. We also examined whether interactions between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours predicts distinct functional outcomes between neurodevelopmental groups. We found that individuals with autism (IQ>70) were most strongly affected by both sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Crucially, we show that while a robust bidirectional link between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours exists across the entire sample, sleep problems amplify repetitive sensorimotor behaviours more strongly only in autistic people than in typical controls. Contrary to previous work, we found that learning disabled children and adolescents engaged in more repetitive sensorimotor behaviour but did not experience more sleep disturbance. Although the interaction between sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours did not determine functional outcomes in autistic people, the interplay of sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviour impaired social awareness in people with ADHD. These findings challenge a transdiagnostic view that treats the reinforcement between sleep and sensorimotor problems as a general marker of neurodevelopmental conditions. Understanding the distinct pathways between sleep and waking behaviours is a critical step toward developing personalized, mechanistic interventions targeting specific sleep and sensory impairment profiles in different neurodevelopmental conditions.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

In these experiments, TRMT61B methylated thousands of novel human mRNA sites, revealing activity on cytosolic mRNAs. We used these novel m1A-modifiable sequences to test the effects of m1A on translation of luciferase reporters and on ribosome recruitment to modified transcripts in the pool. We found that m1A addition can significantly affect translation and ribosome recruitment, but that these effects are vary by transcript.

Here, we solved how energy-limited anaerobes regulate on-demand N2-fixation by sequestering their nitrogenase through the PII-nitrogen regulatory proteins NifI1 and NifI2. The nitrogenase was directly isolated from a methanogenic archaeon, with NifI proteins tightly bound. The crystal structure of the inhibited form, refined to 2.3-[A] resolution, reveals a supercomplex in which three NifI1,2 units made of a NifI1,2 heterohexamer captured three nitrogenases via tentacular T-loops. Additional structural information confirmed that NifI1,2 sits at the nitrogenase reductase-binding site, preventing N2-reduction. The presence of MgATP and 2-oxoglutarate releases NifI1,2 from the nitrogenase core via a conformational switch of the T-loops, provoking a steric repulsion and loss of contacts. The overall molecular depiction corroborates previous genetic, biochemical, and biophysical experiments, proposing that NifI1,2 disrupts the dynamic nitrogenase-reductase association, thereby interfering with electron delivery for N2-fixation and preventing ATP consumption. While ligand-binding mode and the T-loop conformational switch are expected to be conserved among NifI1,2-utilisers, the association mode with the nitrogenase comes in different flavours as a few substitutions in NifI2 break NifI1,2 intramolecular dimerisation in Methanosarcinales species, readjusting the supercomplex without altering the inhibition mechanism. With the NifI1,2 allosteric control dependent on the alarmone 2-oxoglutarate, anaerobes can effectively balance nitrogen-acquisition versus energy-expenditure, a regulatory switch that might be primitive and has been progressively lost in non-energy-limited aerobes, but could inspire biotechnological engineering to optimise ammonia bioproduction.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

L.; Lee, K.-M.; Wong, K.-B.", "abstract": "Maturation of urease, a virulence factor for Helicobacter pylori infection, requires the delivery of nickel ions to the metalloenzyme. To avoid cytotoxicity, nickel ions are transferred within protein complexes of metallochaperones to ensure that the toxic metal do not escape into the cytoplasm. In the urease maturation pathway, metallochaperone UreG receives its nickel ions by forming a 2:2 complex with another metallochaperone UreE. Using C-terminal truncation variants of UreE [UreE(1-158) and UreE(1-148)], we determined the crystal structures of the UreE2G2 complex bound with nickel ions and GMPPNP, a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue. UreE-UreG interactions are asymmetric, where the UreG dimer mainly interact with the proximal UreE. GTP binding induces conformational changes in the G2 and CPH motifs of distal UreG that enable its anchorage to the UreE2G2 complex, justifying why GTP binding promotes the formation of the complex. His68 of the CPH motif of distal UreG moves towards and chelates a nickel ion at the nickel binding site of UreE. Formation of the UreE2G2 complex juxtaposes the nickel binding sites of UreE and UreG. Transfer of nickel from UreE to UreG induce conformational changes that weaken UreE-UreG interactions and promote dissociation of UreG. We further demonstrated that the hydrogenase maturation factor HypA, providing the sole source of nickel ions, could activate urease in vitro by protein-protein interaction with wild-type UreE but not its truncation variants. UreG binding induces conformational changes in the C-terminal tail of UreE and promotes dissociation of HypA-UreE complex and the formation of UreE2G2 complex.\n\nSignificanceOur work provides insights into how cells solve the problem of trafficking a toxic metal, nickel, to the active site of urease. Colonization of Helicobacter pylori in acidic human stomach requires the biosynthesis of active urease, which involves the delivery of the toxic nickel ions to the active site of the metalloenzyme. To avoid cytotoxicity, nickel ions are transported from one metallochaperone to another via the formation of protein complexes so that the toxic metal ions do not escape into the cytoplasm. Supported by structural and biochemical evidence, we present a paradigm on how GTP and nickel binding allosterically promote the formation of a complex between metallochaperones UreE and UreG to facilitate nickel transfer between the two proteins.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Herein, we present an efficient method that leverages an organometallic Pd-complex to site-specifically attach phosphomimetic groups via Cys-arylation, closely mimicking natural phosphorylation. Using this approach, we successfully incorporated native-like tyrosine phosphorylation mimics into cysteine-containing proteins like synthetic transcription factor Max and recombinant aSyn, in good yields. To demonstrate the method's versatility, we created a focused library of mono-, di-, and tri-phosphorylated aSyn analogues. This development enabled, for the first time, the investigation of the effect of site-specific phosphorylation at multiple C-terminal tyrosine residues on aSyn fibrillization and aggregation. Our results show that mono-phosphorylation at any of the C-terminal sites has little effect on aggregation, while di- and tri-phosphorylation slows down the process, extending the lag phase compared to wild-type aSyn. Additionally, phosphorylation at Y39 reduces the seeding activity of aSyn fibrils by almost threefold in both mammalian and neuronal models of synuclein pathology.

Their biosynthesis, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), begins with the condensation of an amino acid, typically serine, and a fatty acyl-CoA. Under certain pathological conditions, alanine can be substituted for serine in the condensation reaction, producing 1-deoxysphingolipids, which lack the 1-hydroxyl group on the sphingoid base. Unlike typical sphingolipids, deoxysphingolipids are unable to accept a head group modification, which alters their metabolic processing and prevents their canonical degradation. The accumulation of these headless deoxysphingolipids causes neurotoxicity in various neurological and metabolic disorders. Here, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify pathways leading to 1-deoxysphinganine-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, a model used to study neurotoxic responses. Our top genetic hits highlighted the pathway involved in synthesizing ceramides with very-long-chain fatty acids (C22-C26). Using CRISPR-Cas9-modified SH-SY5Y cells with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the TECR or CERS2 genes, both critical for producing very-long-chain ceramides, we validated that this pathway was essential for 1-deoxysphinganine-mediated toxicity.

To facilitate engineering of rubisco, we applied an in vivo screen that couples rubisco activity to growth rate of the photoautotrophic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We screened a barcoded mutagenesis library of the form II rubisco from Gallionella sp. containing 15,000 single-site and multi-site variants. Exchanges in loop 6 near the active site, at the dimer interface, and in potential gas tunnels improved rubisco fitness. The dataset also informed protein engineering, using recombination and a trained transformer model. In vitro characterisation of two high-fitness variants showed reduced catalytic efficiency for oxygenation (kcat/Ko) in both and an increased carboxylation turnover (kcatC) in one.

Here, using structural, biophysical, and computational analyses, we uncovered two principles: ACO catalysis relies on an induced-fit mechanism, and disulfide-mediated dimerisation via a conserved cysteine acts as a redox switch toggling ACO between active monomer and inactive dimer. This previously unrecognised regulatory layer positions ACO as a redox sensor in plant cells, revealing a fundamental control point in ethylene biosynthesis.

One proposed reason for this discrepancy is the activity of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a cellular quality-control pathway that degrades mutant transcripts, potentially reducing the presentation of neoantigens that would otherwise stimulate anti-tumour immunity. To address this, we identified publicly available small-molecule inhibitors targeting the NMD factors SMG5 and SMG7 (NMDi), which we have prioritise as the NMD components most strongly associated with NMD efficiency across TCGA tumours, and evaluated their therapeutic potential in vivo. In a syngeneic, DNA repair deficient mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, NMDi treatment alone substantially reduced tumour burden, and its combination with anti-PD-1 therapy led to additive benefit either treatment alone. These effects were immune-dependent and specifically required CD8{square} T cells. Transcriptomic and single-cell analyses revealed that NMDi reprograms the tumour immune microenvironment, enriching for clonally expanded, cytotoxic CD8{square} T cells and altering macrophage states toward those associated with tumour regression. Whole-genome sequencing of tumours revealed that NMDi also promotes immunoediting, leading to negative selection against immunogenic mutations and coding indels, with selective pressure comparable to or greater than that induced by anti-PD-1 treatment. Guided by these results, we generated a new protein language model trained on tumour mutations that can identify neopeptides with immunogenic properties, revealing that the NMDi tumour landscape provides a rich genomic and immunopeptidomic setting for exposing neoantigens that evade immunoediting. Together, these pre-clinical and integrative genomic-transcriptomic insights position NMD inhibition as a promising immunostimulatory strategy that can potentiate immune checkpoint blockade efficacy in tumours.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are approved for homologous recombination-deficient (HRD) high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs), but their long-term effectiveness is limited by the emergence of resistance and hematological toxicity. Approximately 50% of HGSOCs are homologous recombination-proficient (HRP), and within this group, about 20% harbor CCNE1 amplification (cyclin E1-high). PARPi are especially ineffective in HRP tumors and in CCNE1-high HGSOCs, which represent a major unmet clinical need. Loss of a chromatin remodeling enzyme, Amplified in Liver Cancer 1, ALC1, has been shown to enhance PARPi sensitivity. However, the clinical contexts in which ALC1 targeting will be clinically meaningful remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that ALC1 loss can enhance PARPi sensitivity across HRD and cyclin E1-high serous ovarian cancer lines, xenografts and patient-derived cells. ALC1 depletion can overcome several clinically relevant mechanisms of PARPi resistance, though its impact is limited in tumors with complete restoration of HR. Lower ALC1 expression correlates with longer progression-free survival and extended PARPi response. Importantly, ALC1 loss has minimal effects in BRCA-wild-type or BRCA-heterozygous non-cancerous fallopian tube cells, suggesting therapeutic safety. Increased PARPi sensitivity following ALC1 loss can be accurately predicted by endogenous single-stranded DNA levels, identifying a functional biomarker. Together, our studies define the clinical contexts in which the therapeutic utility of PARPi can be expanded by targeting ALC1, whose inhibitors are currently under evaluation in Phase I clinical trials.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

BAA consistently prevented reactivation of 75 - 100% of immunized animals and was also highly and significantly protective against an acute aerosol infection with a consistent 2 - 3 log10 mycobacterial CFU reduction in the lungs relative to nonimmunized mice (Naive). Likewise, the BAA vaccine was significantly more protective than BCG or BCG+Adj controls. Interestingly, we found that pre-challenge frequencies of CD4+ tissue resident memory (TRM) T cells (CD69+PD-1+CXCR3+), and CD4+ populations bearing CD153 and P2X7R, which are markers for protection, were significantly elevated in the lungs of mice immunized with the BAA vaccine relative to control groups. Additionally, we found significantly higher frequencies of multifunctional CD4+ T cells from infected lungs expressing both IL-17A and TGF{beta} or IL-17A, TGF{beta} and IFN-{gamma} than in control groups.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) as one of the main animal models in biomedicine and toxicology are currently kept in barren tanks in most experimental setups, as well as in animal husbandry. Structural enrichment with artificial plants is currently discussed as a potential refinement measure to provide a more diverse environment. It was shown, that this can reduce stress and improve cognitive abilities, survival rate and fertility in these animals. Still, concerns remain regarding its long-term benefits and drawbacks. Therefore, we introduced artificial plants in our husbandry tanks, and evaluated over a one-year period if in our specific system, the benefits would outweigh the risks. Comparing six different lines of zebrafish raised in enriched tanks or under our standard conditions, we saw no significant difference in terms of sex ratio, fertility or pathogen burden. Enrichment increased the survival rate of 4 % during upbringing, albeit not statistically significant due to high variation. When analyzing zebrafish behavior in their 8 L home-tanks, we found less zebrafish in areas close to the plants but rather a preference for the open water in the middle or opposite side of the tank. This effect was even more pronounced at lower holding densities of less than 4 fish per liter. In summary, we found that introducing structural enrichment to our zebrafish facility carried low cost and no detrimental effects for the animals but at the same time benefits were difficult to determine in our readouts as our survival rates already were very high without these measures. We like to encourage other animal facilities to evaluate enrichment measures to ensure a broader discussion on long-term benefits of structural enrichment in zebrafish husbandry systems.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

However, distinguishing genuine non neutral dynamics from neutral drift with realistic biological constraints requires explicit computational null models, which are currently absent from repertoire immunology. Methods: We developed a biologically calibrated neutral null model incorporating thymic output, negative selection, and peripheral homeostasis with parameters independently derived from immunology literature. The model was validated against empirical repertoire statistics before generating predictions. We compared neutral predictions to occurrence patterns from twenty four thousand eight hundred forty seven TCR epitope combinations in VDJdb across four viral targets using multi observable testing, including power law exponent, Shannon entropy, and public clonotype fraction, with Bonferroni corrected thresholds. Results: The neutral null model successfully reproduced three independent benchmarks. Public clonotype fraction in VDJdb (three point ten percent) significantly exceeded neutral predictions (one point forty seven percent plus minus zero point twenty nine percent, one hundredth percentile, p less than zero point zero zero one, Cohen d equals five point sixty two), inconsistent with neutrality at stringent thresholds. In contrast, power law exponent (alpha equals two point four five zero versus two point three nine one plus minus zero point one seven seven, p equals zero point seven three nine, d equals zero point thirty three) and Shannon entropy (H equals twelve point ten versus twelve point thirty four plus minus one point seventeen bits, p equals zero point eight three eight, d equals minus zero point twenty one) showed negligible deviations. This dissociation, where public fraction deviates while diversity metrics remain neutral consistent, is consistent with but does not prove selective enrichment for cross individual TCR convergence. Supplementary analyses confirmed public enrichment is temporally stable from two thousand nine to two thousand twenty four, and universal across viral pathogens, constraining plausible curation bias mechanisms. Conclusions: We present a falsificationist framework for testing neutrality in TCR repertoires via pre validated computational nulls, multi observable comparisons, and effect size quantification. Application to VDJdb reveals public clonotype patterns suggestive of non neutral processes, including functional selection or curation bias, establishing testable hypotheses for experimental follow up. The framework, emphasizing independent validation, pre specified decision criteria, and effect size quantification, generalizes to antibody repertoires, microbiomes, and evolutionary systems requiring mechanistic discrimination between drift and selection.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Yet, the combined effects of these changes on higher-level visual perception remain unclear, partly because concurrent cognitive decline may complicate the use of stored knowledge. In this study, we examined how prior knowledge shapes visual perception in younger (<40 years) and older (>60 years) adults using ambiguous two-tone images, whose recognition depends on prior knowledge. Providing participants with the original photographs used to generate the two-tones triggered perceptual reorganisation, improving recognition in both groups. Although older adults recognised fewer two-tones overall - a pattern linked to reduced visual acuity - they showed a comparable benefit from prior knowledge when cued. These findings suggest that, despite age-related sensory decline, the ability to draw on prior knowledge remains robust in older adulthood and may help preserve perceptual function.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

The Ec-Ef interactions were not strain-specific, although Ef affected the non-B2 and B2 strains differently.

Maternal treatment with AMOX/CLAV, but not AMP, significantly reduced PCV-specific IgG titers at 4- and 6-weeks post-prime immunization compared to untreated controls.

Quorum sensing relies on the production of chemical signals called autoinducers and the subsequent detection of those signals by a cognate receptor. Many Gram-negative bacteria use the LuxR-type family of transcription factor receptors that bind to acyl-homoserine lactone autoinducer signals to regulate their function as DNA-binding proteins. A subclass of this family of transcription factor receptors requires their cognate autoinducer to fold and dimerize to bind DNA to regulate gene expression and, thus, traits associated with quorum sensing, such as biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Here, we use a chemical-genetic approach to determine the structural basis for ligand selection by the quorum-sensing receptor RhlR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The native ligand for RhlR is N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone, and this protein-ligand interaction is important for initiating gene expression in P. aeruginosa. We determine key residues that drive ligand specificity and selectivity of RhlR to define the role of ligand-driven RhlR-dependent gene regulation of quorum-sensing traits, namely the differential expression of the phenazine genes, which encode the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the redox-sensitive virulence factor pyocyanin, among other phenazines.

Brain injury and microglial activation are major determinants of outcome, yet the mechanisms linking infection, inflammation and neuronal injury remain poorly understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), key mediators of cell-to-cell communication, have been investigated in pulmonary TB but their role in TB meningitis remains unexplored. We used our young rabbit model of TB meningitis to isolate pure, intact EVs from brain tissue (i.e., brain-derived EVs) from infected and uninfected rabbits and used nanoflow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and protein quantification to characterize the EVs. Comparative proteomic profiling was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), followed by in silico pathway, cell-type and protein-protein interaction analyses using DAVID, Enrichr, and STRING databases. We found that EV isolation from fresh and frozen tissue was equivalent and demonstrated that M. tuberculosis infection activated EV biogenesis. Despite preserved vesicle morphology, EVs from infected brain showed a significant proteomic shift characterized by enrichment of TB host defense, microglial and immune activation, metabolic excitotoxicity, and neuronal injury. These proteome dysregulations suggest that infection reprograms brain EV cargo toward proinflammatory and metabolic stress responses while depleting neuronal and mitochondrial components. Collectively, these data demonstrate that M. tuberculosis infection alters the cargo and abundance of brain-derived EV, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and mediators of host-pathogen interactions in TB meningitis.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

PRINS editing, a PEn variant utilizing springRNAs, uniquely relies on non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) for insertions, providing an insertion-only strategy ideal for functional protein tagging or serine integrase landing pad insertions, yet it suffers from inherent imprecision. Here, we identify the DNA repair factor Artemis (DCLRE1C) as a key regulator of PEn-generated indel profiles, particularly in springRNA-mediated PRINS editing. Through a targeted genetic screen, we show that the absence of Artemis significantly shifts indel distributions away from deletions and shorter truncations towards longer, functionally acceptable insertions. Our data indicates that Artemis cleaves PEn-generated 3'-overhangs in a length-dependent manner, with its impact increasing for longer reverse-transcribed overhangs. This understanding reveals that regulating Artemis activity can improve insertion frequency specifically for PRINS. We develop and validate robust epigenetic (CRISPRoff) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategies to effectively silence/knockdown Artemis expression, successfully recapitulating the beneficial PRINS editing outcomes observed in Artemis-deficient cells. Leveraging these insights, we show that Artemis modulation can enhance endogenous protein tagging in cells, including challenging hiPSC-derived non-dividing cardiomyocytes. Our findings support Artemis as a key regulator of PRINS editing outcomes and present a tunable strategy to optimize insertion efficiency for diverse genomic engineering and therapeutic applications.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

We evaluated sputum liquefaction, host nucleic acid depletion strategies, and SMART-9N-based cDNA amplification to enhance microbial and viral nucleic acid recovery. We found that dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment significantly improved nucleic acid extraction. DNase I treatment effectively reduced host background while preserving both viral and bacterial sequences, outperforming filtration-based approaches that reduced viral recovery. The optimized workflow enabled unbiased detection and strain-level resolution of respiratory pathogens, including rhinovirus C1/C42, human coronavirus HKU1, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with high genome coverage. This approach demonstrated robust performance for respiratory pathogen identification directly from sputum samples.

In this study we provide the first full account of the development of the Mediterranean starfish Hacelia attenuata, from oocyte maturation through embryogenesis and larval formation, showing that its development largely follows the canonical pattern known from other asteroids. Oocytes resume meiosis when exposed to 1-methyladenine, exhibiting conserved features such as formation of a nuclear actin shell for chromosome gathering prior to meiotic spindle assembly. Embryogenesis then proceeds through equal radial cleavages to form a ciliated blastula, followed by gastrulation via invagination and mesenchymal cell delamination. The larvae develop through typical bipinnaria and brachiolaria stages, displaying characteristic feeding structures and attachment organs. Importantly, developmental rate increases substantially at higher temperatures, consistent with the species distribution in warm Mediterranean waters.

FicD activity is regulated by ER-stress, catalyzing BiP AMPylation under low stress conditions to hold inactive chaperone in reserve. In stressed cells, FicD deAMPylates BiP, acutely increasing its active pool to assist in protein folding. Variants in UPR machinery, including those in the FicD gene, are linked to hereditary diseases. Despite the known role of FicD in UPR, in-vivo regulation of its activity remains elusive, and identifying metabolites that alter FicD activity could prove useful pharmaceutically. We applied an unbiased high-throughput screening platform, known as Mass spectrometry Integrated with equilibrium Dialysis for the discovery of Allostery Systematically (MIDAS), to identify novel small molecule metabolites that might regulate FicD activity. MIDAS revealed interactions between FicD and two mavelonate pathway intermediates : geranyl-pyrophosphate and farnesyl-pyrophosphate. Biochemical characterization indicates that both potently inhibit FicD-mediated AMPylation and deAMPylation. The crystal structure of FicD bound to farnesyl-pyrophosphate demonstrates a competitive inhibition mechanism, with the pyrophosphate adopting the alpha and beta phosphate positions of ATP and the hydrocarbon chain filling the nucleoside pocket. FicD variants previously appeared as biochemically indistinguishable, yet lead to different human pathologies. We demonstrate farnesyl-pyrophosphate inhibits FicDR374H and FicDR374C variants implicated in causing hereditary spastic paraplegia, but not the FicDR371S variant associated with neonatal diabetes.

Sonobiopsy, which uses FUS induced BBBO to release brain derived molecules into the bloodstream, provides a molecular readout from blood samples. Nanobubbles (NBs) are smaller agents that circulate more effectively in the brain microvasculature and have shown enhanced BBBO in capillaries. Here, NB-mediated proteomic sonobiopsy is used to improve biomarker efflux and increase molecular sensitivity, with the goal of defining the molecular signature produced by BBBO in healthy and glioblastoma (GBM) models, and distinguishing biomarkers associated with tumor pathology from BBBO biomarkers. Plasma collected before and after NB-mediated FUS underwent data-independent acquisition-based mass spectrometry, revealing post-BBBO changes in healthy and tumor bearing mice. In healthy cohorts, 77 proteins were reproducibly altered after BBBO. Six proteins (Dpysl3, Myl1, Mybpc1, Vsig4, Krt33a, Krtap6-5) were detectable only after BBBO in healthy mice. In 005 glioma bearing mice, the BBBO signature identified in healthy animals was preserved, and comparison with matched shams isolated tumor specific effects. Three proteins, Itih4, Lrg1, and Hp, rose significantly after BBBO only in GBM and reached higher post treatment levels than in shams, nominating candidate GBM-associated markers accessible via blood.

E.", "abstract": "Background Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), but in-vivo data on the spatial myocardial distribution and systemic effects of ROS after IRI remain limited. This multimodal CMR and PET/CT study aimed to non-invasively image ROS activity in a clinically-relevant swine model of IRI using [18F]ROStrace, a fluorine-18-labeled analogue of dihydroethidium (DHE), and to investigate regional changes in ROS activity in the infarcted myocardium during the subacute post-IRI phase. Methods IRI was induced by percutaneous occlusion of the left anterior descending artery for 90 minutes in swine (N=9). CMR and whole-body PET/CT imaging with [18F]ROStrace were performed before myocardial infarction (MI) and 3-5 days post-MI to assess ROS in on-infarct myocardium, lungs, bone marrow, spleen and skeletal muscle. Late gadolinium enhanced CMR was performed to structurally characterize infarct regions. Post-MI, in vivo [18F]ROStrace signal in infarcted myocardium was compared with remote, non-infarcted myocardium and validated via ex vivo DHE fluorescent imaging. Bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and Gene Ontology pathway analysis were conducted on biopsies from infarct and remote myocardial tissue to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways connected to oxidative stress. Results During the subacute phase following MI, [18F]ROStrace fractional uptake rate (FUR; min-1) was significantly increased in skeletal muscle, compared to baseline (0.011{+/-}0.003 vs 0.016{+/-}0.005, p=0.04), with a trend toward increased FUR in bone marrow (0.046{+/-}0.009 vs 0.056{+/-}0.011, p=0.12) and the left ventricular free wall (0.067{+/-}0.007 vs 0.073{+/-}0.010, p=0.15). Within the myocardium, [18F]ROStrace FUR ((min-1)/(mL/min/g)) was significantly higher in infarcted compared to non-infarcted myocardium regions (0.110{+/-}0.034, vs 0.148{+/-}0.035, p=0.0005). DHE staining confirmed elevated ROS levels in the infarcted myocardium. RNA-seq identified 8,707 differentially expressed genes between infarct and remote myocardium, with downregulated pathways in the infarct associated with mitochondrial function, cellular respiration, and metabolic adaptation. Conclusion This study demonstrated MI ROS imaging using [18F]ROStrace using a whole-body PET/CT scanner and structural assessment with CMR.

To systematically evaluate this heterogeneity, we developed a long-read, read-level analysis pipeline that directly classifies individual AAV genomes and their structural variants from PacBio sequencing data. The workflow combines two components: a tiling step that aligns each read to reference sequences to generate positional patterns, and a parsing step that applies a formal grammar to categorize reads into five structural classes: expected, truncated, snapback, truncated snapback, and others. Each molecule is annotated with strand orientation, breakpoint coordinates, and structural arrangement, enabling precise classification of genome heterogeneity at single-vector resolution. Applied to both single-stranded and self-complementary vector genome preparations, the pipeline achieved high classification accuracy and revealed distinct patterns of genome structure between different vector constructs. In both cases, the majority of genomes were classified as expected full-length species, consistent with the dominant full peaks observed by orthogonal methods. For snapback genomes, breakpoints frequently clustered at discrete sites, with some coinciding with regions predicted to form stable secondary structures and others occurring in less structured regions. This distribution suggests contributions from both sequence-driven folding and additional replication- or processing-related mechanisms. Together, these read-level insights highlight sequence and structural features that shape AAV genome heterogeneity. Importantly, the pipeline demonstrated strong performance in structural classification, maintaining high accuracy even in the presence of sequencing error profiles such as homopolymer-associated indels (insertion or deletion). By integrating structural classification, sequence context, and secondary-structure predictions, our pipeline provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating recombinant adeno-associated virus genome diversity.

To address this challenge, we developed a novel checkpoint inhibitor approach that uses mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to deliver a high-affinity, soluble PD1 receptor (sPD1HAC).

More recent models, including AlphaFold3 (AF3) and RosettaFold All-Atom (RFAA), extend this capability to protein-ligand co-folding, enabling direct prediction of bound complexes from sequence and ligand inputs. This advance has raised the possibility that such models could function not only as structure predictors but also as AI-based molecular docking engines for virtual screening. Yet their true impact on ligand discovery remains unclear and, in many cases, controversial. Here, we systematically assess AF3 co-folding across tasks central to small-molecule discovery compared to conventional molecular docking. First, retrospective enrichment of actives over decoys showed that AF3 outperforms the physics-based docking program DOCK3 across 43 drug targets in DUDE-Z; however, this advantage is largely driven by hidden ligand-only biases inherent to computational decoy sets. In contrast, in three large experimental datasets (the sigma-2 receptor ({sigma}2), the D4 dopamine receptor (D4), AmpC {beta}-lactamase (AmpC)) with over 2,500 tested molecules that lack such biases, DOCK3 achieved stronger overall enrichment, while AF3 contributed mainly to early enrichment. Second, out-of-sample pose reproduction on >8,000 protein-ligand complexes deposited after the AF3 training and validation cutoff showed that AF3 accuracy is strongly dependent on training-set similarity, indicating that the model memorizes atomic positions more than learning general principles of molecular recognition. Finally, in the first prospective head-to-head screen against the {sigma}2 receptor, novel to AF3's training set, AF3 achieved a 13% hit rate and identified a 13 nM binder directly from the screen. However, compared with the parallel DOCK3 campaign, AF3 delivered a two-fold lower hit rate, despite yielding a similar affinity distribution among the top five hits. AF3 therefore represents the beginning of deep-learning-based structure-guided ligand discovery: a complementary tool rather than a replacement for conventional docking, with practical applications both as a screening engine and as a post-docking filter that improves hit rates.

Reverse gyrase (RG) is a unique type of topoisomerase that introduces positive supercoils into DNA and appears exclusively in hyperthermophiles where it was proposed to play a key, yet still elusive, role. Here, we investigate RG activity in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis at 85C, its optimal growth temperature, using genetics and functional genomics assays. Deletion of RG led to a loss of positive supercoiling in plasmid DNA and the reduced dynamic range of transcription, without affecting histone occupancy. To investigate the effects of RG loss on the topology of chromosomal DNA, we established a psoralen photobinding assay (TMP-seq) in T. kodakarensis under native growth conditions. TMP enrichment patterns were consistent with the twin-domain model of transcription and further revealed that promoters of expressed transcription units are, on average, underwound. TMP-seq profiles in an RG deletion strain revealed that promoters are hotspots for RG activity, consistent with RG acting on hyper-negatively supercoiled substrates. We propose that RG acts not as a global modulator of supercoiling, but as a local genome guardian, selectively stabilising vulnerable regulatory regions to ensure a delicate balance between DNA accessibility and integrity under extremely high temperatures.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Recent observations in women and mice infected with Chlamydia suggest that type I interferon (IFN-I) may have deleterious effects. This study aimed at elucidating the consequences of IFN-I production on C. trachomatis-induced inflammation in epithelial cells and the molecular pathway(s) involved. We showed that combination of IFN-I and Chlamydia resulted in a stronger induction of inflammation than Chlamydia alone, while IFN-I alone had no effect. Inhibiting AKT and mTOR, but not silencing STAT1, significantly attenuated the synergetic effect between IFN-I and bacteria on inflammation. Inhibition of ERK also blocked this synergistic effect, although ERK were not activated by IFN-I. We hypothesized that IFN-I enhanced the expression of a pathogen recognition receptor of the host, thereby potentiating detection of the bacteria and the subsequent inflammatory response. IFN-I, but not C. trachomatis infection, increased the expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), and silencing or knocking-out TLR3 prevented the synergetic effect between infection and IFN-I. Furthermore, our data support the presence of dsRNA in infected cells and the activation of the MAPK/ERK and AP-1/ATF2 signaling cascades downstream of TLR3. Taken together, our data demonstrate that IFN-I exacerbates the host inflammatory response triggered by Chlamydia by increasing TLR3 expression and activation, leading to hyperinflammation. The identified signaling cascades represent potential targets for therapeutical intervention to limit tissue damage upon Chlamydia infection.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Whereas the structural core assembly of T6SS is well characterized, the role of diverse accessory proteins during assembly remains under investigation. One well-conserved accessory protein is TagF, a post-translational inhibitor of T6SS dynamics, which was previously characterized in the context of a kinase-phosphatase signaling relay. Here, we identify a subset of T6SS clusters in which TagF occurs in a distinct regulatory context and without known binding partners. Investigating the role of TagF in the constitutively active Acinetobacter baylyi T6SS, we show that though TagF can suppress assembly dynamics, it primarily acts as an assembly coordinator. Using structured illumination microscopy, we show that TagF coordinates the transition from baseplate assembly to sheath elongation by preventing premature and nonproductive sheath assembly in absence of the VgrG spike. Direct interactions with the conserved T6SS tube protein Hcp suggested that TagF blocks sheath elongation by binding and disrupting Hcp hexamers and thus preventing tube formation. Finally, we show that TagF activity depends on crosstalk with TagZ, a previously uncharacterized membrane associated accessory protein that recruits TagF to the cell periphery, and demonstrate that this interaction can be specifically disrupted by expression of an artificial TagF-binding protein. Together, our [fi]ndings establish a novel role of TagF as a checkpoint protein that controls for spike-insertion into the baseplate to ensure effective T6SS assembly.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Longitudinal profiling of colonic epithelial and lamina propria cells revealed a selective loss of IL-17/IL-22-producing {gamma}{delta} T cells and type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s). This loss correlated with reduced expression of the transcription factors AhR and ROR{gamma}t and was associated with elevated plasma markers of intestinal epithelial barrier disruption (IEBD), including intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP), zonulin, and LPS-binding protein (LBP).

Using hierarchical phase-contrast tomography (HiP-CT) the atrioventricular conduction system in pediatric ToF specimens was investigated non-destructively and in 3D. Methods: Eighteen whole-heart specimens (11 ToF, 7 controls) were imaged at the European Synchrotron, ESRF. Segmentation and 3D renderings demonstrated gross morphology. Morphology, size, depth and course of the non-branching bundle and right bundle branch (RBB) were quantified using custom computational pipelines. Segmentations were visualized in VheaRts, a Unity3D-based XR platform. Results: The ToF conduction system was more draped than in controls, bilaterally spanning the septum, resembling early embryonic architecture. The RBB was variable in origin, course and morphologic structure with significantly smaller indexed cross-sectional area in native ToF versus controls (0.05 (SD 0.20) vs 0.50 (SD 0.20) mm2, p = 0.005). One anomalous fasciculo-ventricular connection and six dead-end tracts were found. Regions at surgical risk included the posterior-inferior margin of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and the septal crest along its nadir. The superior margin of the VSD at its intersection with the aortic root was free of conduction tissue. The HiP-CT to VR pipeline enabled interactive 3D visualization of conduction pathways relative to key structures.

In male germ cells, two types of cilia are present: zygotene primary cilia and sperm flagella. To define the role of cilia in spermatogenesis, we conditionally ablated the distal appendage protein CEP164, required for basal body docking and ciliogenesis, in male germ cells. CEP164 localized to the mother centriole/basal body throughout spermatogenesis, and its loss led to male infertility accompanied by absence of both zygotene cilia and sperm flagella. Despite defective ciliogenesis, meiotic chromosome pairing and DNA double-strand break repair proceeded normally. However, round spermatids exhibited basal body docking and flagellogenesis defects, and frequently formed supernumerary centriole clusters that were subsequently eliminated via residual bodies. Live cell imaging revealed that centrioles were highly mobile, and centriole pairs from neighboring cells often associated through intercellular bridges, forming aggregates. These results establish that basal body docking is crucial for retaining centrioles within spermatids, and its disruption leads to centriole clustering and loss. In contrast, zygotene cilia are dispensable for meiotic chromosome pairing and DNA repair during mammalian spermatogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) are important aquaculture species with different natural habitats, food preferences and feeding behaviors. Herein, we utilize these two species to evaluate whether food-related cart functions are species-specific. To this end, we studied how short-term (SD) or long-term (LD) food deprivation affects the central expression of the multiple cart genes of both species. Quantitative PCR analysis of cart expression demonstrated that SD resulted in decreased midbrain expression of three tilapia carts and three seabream carts while LD decreased the midbrain expression of two tilapia carts and two seabream carts. In addition, SD increased the expression of tilapia oncart1c in the anterior brain and oncart1c and oncart1b in the posterior brain while reducing the expression of seabream sacart1c. Our analyses showed that there are cart genes in each species (cart1a and cart1b for tilapia, and cart1b for seabream) that responded to both SD and LD by reduced expression in the midbrain.

C.; Garcia, P.; Kumar Singh, S.; Graciet, E.", "abstract": "The ubiquitin-dependent Arg/N-degron pathway relates the stability of a substrate protein to the nature of its N-terminal amino acid residue or its biochemical modifications, with some N-terminal residues being recognized by specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, resulting in the ubiquitylation and degradation of the substrate protein. Work in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that the Arg/N-degron pathway is a key regulator of plant responses to hypoxia, which can be either physiological or a stress in the context of waterlogging or submergence. The role of the Arg/N-degron pathway in hypoxia response is mediated via the oxygen-dependent degradation of group VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF-VII) transcription factors, which act as the master regulators of the hypoxia response program in plants. Analysis of Arabidopsis mutants for different enzymatic components of the Arg/N-degron pathway has also revealed its roles in the regulation of responses to other abiotic stresses (e.g. salt stress), as well as to pathogens. Although much has been learned from studies in Arabidopsis about the functions of the Arg/N-degron pathway, very little is known about this pathway in crops, including in Brassica crops such oilseed rape, cabbage or turnip. To determine functional similarities and divergence of the Arg/N-degron pathway between Arabidopsis and Brassica crops, we isolated and characterized the first Arg/N-degron pathway mutants in Brassica rapa (turnip, pak choi), a diploid Brassica crop closely related to oilseed rape. We focused on two enzymatic components, namely the arginine-transferases (ATEs) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase PROTEOLYSIS6 (PRT6). Our results show both similarities and divergence of function for these Arg/N-degron pathway components in B. rapa compared to Arabidopsis. Specifically, ATE mutants in B. rapa are seedling lethal, which contrasts with the mild phenotypic defects of the equivalent Arabidopsis mutants. Double mutant lines for two of the three PRT6 genes in B. rapa indicated a constitutive activation of hypoxia response genes at the transcriptional level, as shown in the single mutant prt6 in Arabidopsis. However, contrary to Arabidopsis, the B. rapa double mutants were more sensitive to waterlogging and hypoxia, and did not show differential response to salt stress or to biotic stress compared to the wild type. The functional divergence identified likely reflects variability in each species in the substrate repertoire and/or in the regulation of pathways or targets downstream of Arg/N-degron pathway substrates. Such differences could be driven by direct selective pressures at N-termini (e.g. gain or loss of a destabilizing N-terminal residue), or by species-specific proteases that may generate destabilizing neo-N-termini after cleavage. These similarities and differences highlight the difficulties in translating research findings from Arabidopsis to crops, even within the same plant family (Brassicaceae) and highlight the need to study pathways in crops.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}

Cysteine S-nitrosylation (SNO) is a reversible post-translational modification that controls complex cell behaviors by regulating protein interactions and signal transduction events. Here we identified a cluster of T. gondii secreted effector proteins that are SNO-modified in a host inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS)-dependent manner. Among these were the rhoptry protein 5 (ROP5) paralogs, which are the major virulence determinants in T. gondii and an immunodominant antigen in B6 mice. ROP5 was necessary for Type I and Type II parasites to evade IFN-{gamma}-mediated immune clearance in iNOS-deficient macrophages. RNS led to the loss of ROP5 association with the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, which is necessary for the known functions of ROP5. Infection with ROP5 knockout parasites rescued the susceptibility of iNOS-deficient mice to infection with Type II T. gondii.

O.", "abstract": "Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause severe disease and death in infants and immunocompromised people. Although effective at treating CMV, the first-line drug ganciclovir (GCV) has high rates of pharmacokinetic variability which leads to significant rates of underexposure or toxicity. Intracellular concentrations of the active anabolite of GCV, ganciclovir triphosphate (GCV-TP), are associated with dose-dependent neutropenia and could enable dose individualization to improve treatment efficacy and reduce adverse effects. However, GCV-TP is currently measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) which is impractical for routine use, especially in resource-limited settings, because of its high cost, labor-intensiveness, and need for specialized equipment. To address this gap, we adapted the REverse transcriptase ACTivity with CRISPR (REACTR) assay to measure GCV-TP. Methods: We leveraged our earlier work using REACTR to measure reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors used to treat and prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because GCV-TP serendipitously also inhibits HIV RT. We designed custom DNA templates, primers, and CRISPR complexes to accurately measure GCV-TP spiked into buffer and blood. We evaluated the analytical performance of the assay with 40 dried blood spots from infants with congenital CMV. Results: REACTR reproducibly measured clinically relevant GCV-TP concentrations using a simple workflow and equipment that are readily available in many clinical laboratories. REACTR measurements of clinical samples correlated with LC-MS/MS GCV-TP measurements (r = -0.7891; p<0.0001). Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of REACTR as a rapid and accessible alternative to LC-MS/MS for therapeutic drug monitoring of GCV.", "date": "2025-12-08", "journal": ""}
