N.; Chandra, N.", "abstract": "Macrophages are driven to form distinct functional phenotypes in response to different immunological stimuli, in a process widely referred to as macrophage polarization. Transcriptional regulators that guide macrophage polarization in response to a given trigger remain largely unknown. In this study, we interrogate the programmable landscape in macrophages to find regulatory panels that determine the precise polarization state that a macrophage is driven to. Towards this, we configure an integrative network analysis pipeline that utilizes macrophage transcriptomes in response to 28 distinct stimuli and reconstructs contextualized human gene regulatory networks, and identifies epicentres of perturbations in each case. We find that these contextualized regulatory networks form a spectrum of thirteen distinct clusters with M1 and M2 at the two ends. Using our computational pipeline, we identify combinatorial panels of epicentric regulatory factors (RFs) for each polarization state. We demonstrate that a set of three RFs i.e., CEBPB, NFE2L2 and BCL3, is sufficient to change the polarization destination from M1 to M2. siRNA knockdown of the 3-RF set in THP1 derived M0 cells, despite exposure to an M1 stimulant, significantly attenuated the shift to M1 phenotype, and instead increased the expression of M2 markers. Single knockdown of each RF also showed a similar trend. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of the 3-RF set rendered the macrophages hyper-susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus infection, demonstrating the importance of these factors in modulating immune responses. Overall, our results provide insights into the transcriptional mechanisms underlying macrophage polarization and identify key regulatory factors that may be targeted to modulate immune responses.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

We have generated rat models using similar modifications of the testis-determining gene Sry, to produce XX and XY rats with the same type of gonad, as well as XO, XXY and XYY rats with varying gonads. The models permit discovery of novel sex-chromosome effects (XX vs. XY) that contribute to sex differences in any rat phenotype, and test for effects of different numbers of X or Y chromosomes. Methods: XY rats were created with an autosomal transgene of Sry, producing XX and XY progeny with testes. In other rats, CRISPR-Cas9 technology was used to remove Y chromosome factors that initiate testis differentiation, producing fertile XY gonadal females. Interbreeding of these lines produced rats with interesting combinations of sex chromosomes and gonads: XO, XX, XY, XXY rats with ovaries; and XO, XX, XY, XXY, and XYY rats with testes. These groups can be compared to detect sex differences caused by sex-chromosome complement (XX vs. XY) and/or by gonadal hormones (rats with testes vs. ovaries). Other comparisons detect the effects of X or Y chromosome number (in gonadal females: XO vs. XX, XX vs. XXY, XO vs. XY, XY vs. XXY; in gonadal males: XY vs. XXY, XY vs. XYY; XX vs. XXY, XO vs. XY). Results: We measured numerous phenotypes to characterize these models, including gonadal histology, breeding performance, anogenital distance, levels of reproductive hormones, body and organ weights, and central nervous system sexual dimorphisms. Serum testosterone levels were comparable in adult XX and XY gonadal males. Phenotypes previously known to be sexually differentiated by the action of gonadal hormones were found to be similar in XX and XY rats with the same type of gonad, suggesting that XX and XY rats with the same type of gonad have comparable levels of gonadal hormones at various stages of development. Conclusion: The results establish powerful new models to discriminate sex-chromosome and gonadal hormone effects that cause sexual differences in rat physiology and disease.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Using cryo-electron microscopy, we elucidate how {beta}arr1 recruits and activates the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src, the first identified signaling partner of {beta}arrs. {beta}arr1 engages Src SH3 through two distinct sites, each employing a different recognition mechanism: a polyproline motif in the N-domain and a non-proline-based interaction in the central crest region. At both sites {beta}arr1 interacts with the aromatic surface of SH3, disrupting the autoinhibited conformation of Src and directly triggering its allosteric activation. This structural evidence establishes {beta}arr1 as an active regulatory protein rather than a passive scaffold and suggests a potentially general mechanism for {beta}arr-mediated signaling across diverse effectors.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we systematically compared protein dynamics in mouse and human neural progenitors (NPs) and examined how protein stability influences developmental timing. We find that mouse NPs exhibit faster protein production and degradation than human NPs. Human NPs display broadly increased protein half-lives, independent of cellular compartment or protein function, and this difference persists in post-mitotic neurons. Consistent with this, proteasomal activity is lower in human embryonic spinal cord and stem cell-derived neural progenitors than mouse, correlating with reduced expression of proteasome-associated proteins. Functionally, accelerating the degradation of the key transcriptional repressor IRX3 in mouse NPs speeds the activation of its target gene, providing causal evidence that protein turnover modulates developmental tempo.

In Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients, cortico-striatal decoupling is widely reported while its onset and cellular mechanism remain largely unclear. Using dual-site fiber photometry and Cre transgenic mouse lines, we examined activity coordination between M1 cortex and dorsal striatum (cortico-striatal coupling) with cell-type resolution. This method identifies motor behavior-specific coupling patterns with different contribution from striatal D1R- and D2R-expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs). In an -synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF) induced PD-like mouse model, cortico-striatal coupling associated with digging behavior is selectively disrupted as early as two months post-induction, whose progressive deterioration correlates with later-onset behavioral deficits. Optogenetic disruption of cortico-striatal coupling is sufficient to induce digging deficits in wild-type mice. Furthermore, such decoupling is mainly mediated by impaired D1R MSNs, which can be rescued by D1 receptor activation or L-DOPA. These findings demonstrate that early-onset, behavior- and cell type-specific cortico-striatal decoupling emerges early during the development of PD-like symptoms.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

We reasoned that while residue level descriptions of biomolecules are efficient for de novo structure prediction, for probing heterogeneity of interactions with small molecules in the folded state an entirely atomic level description could have advantages in speed and generality. We developed a graph neural network called PLACER (Protein-Ligand Atomistic Conformational Ensemble Resolver) trained to recapitulate correct atomic positions from partially corrupted input structures from the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank; the nodes of the graph are the atoms in the system. PLACER accurately generates structures of diverse organic small molecules given knowledge of their atom composition and bonding, and given a description of the larger protein context, builds up structures of small molecules and protein side chains for protein-small molecule docking. Because PLACER is rapid and stochastic, ensembles of predictions can be readily generated to map conformational heterogeneity. In enzyme design efforts described here and elsewhere, we find that using PLACER to assess the accuracy and pre-organization of the designed active sites results in higher success rates and higher activities; we obtain a preorganized retroaldolase with a kcat/KM of 11,000 M-1min-1, considerably higher than any pre-deep learning design for this reaction. We anticipate that PLACER will be widely useful for rapidly generating conformational ensembles of small molecule and small molecule-protein systems, and for designing higher activity preorganized enzymes.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Success of seed plants at individual and population levels strongly depends on the timing of germination and the rapidness of seedling establishment. Arabidopsis thaliana SEED DORMANCY 4-LIKE (AtSDR4L) and its paralog Dynamic Influencer of Gene Expression 2 (DIG2) are transcriptional co-repressors that promote seed-to-seedling phase transition. Their regulatory roles in promoting germination at the temporal and tissue-specific scales remain elusive. We show that strong germination arrest of Atsdr4l dig2 is alleviated by ABA antagonists. Isolated mutant embryos develop faster than intact seeds, but still exhibit delayed growth. Atsdr4l dig2 seeds show extensive changes in gene expression in both the seed coat and the embryo, with a subset of the genes differentially expressed tissue-specifically. MIKC-type MADS-box genes are the top-enriched transcription factor family among up-regulated genes in both seed compartments of Atsdr4l dig2, and AGAMOUS-LIKE44 (AGL44) is a direct target of both AtSDR4L and DIG2. Many hormonal genes and hypoxia-responsive genes are misregulated in the double mutant seeds, accompanied by an over-accumulation of abscisic acid, auxin, their derivatives, as well as the immediate precursor of ethylene.

Hox genes have long been considered prime candidates for determining the anteroposterior positioning of these paired appendages during development. Evidence from various model organisms, including mouse and chick, supports a role for Hox genes in limb positioning. However, despite extensive phenotypic analyses of numerous single and compound Hox knockout mice, clear genetic evidence for substantial defects in limb positioning has been limited, leaving questions unresolved. In a previous study, we generated seven distinct hox cluster-deficient mutants in zebrafish. Here, we provide genetic evidence that zebrafish hoxba;hoxbb cluster-deleted mutants specifically exhibit a complete lack of pectoral fins, accompanied by the absence of tbx5a expression in pectoral fin buds. In these mutants, tbx5a expression in the pectoral fin field of the lateral plate mesoderm fails to be induced at an early stage, suggesting a loss of pectoral fin precursor cells. Furthermore, the competence to respond to retinoic acid is lost in hoxba;hoxbb cluster mutants, indicating that tbx5a expression cannot be induced in the pectoral fin buds. We further identify hoxb4a, hoxb5a, and hoxb5b as pivotal genes underlying this process. Although the frameshift mutations in these hox genes do not recapitulate the absence of pectoral fins, we demonstrate that deletion mutants at these genomic loci show the absence of pectoral fins with low penetrance. Our results suggest that, by establishing the expression domains along the anteroposterior axis, hoxb4a, hoxb5a, and hoxb5b within hoxba and hoxbb clusters cooperatively determine the positioning of zebrafish pectoral fins through the induction of tbx5a expression in the restricted pectoral fin field.

By analyzing intracranial EEG data collected from childhood (5-10 years old) and post-childhood groups (13-55 years old), we find differential involvement of high-level brain areas in processing facial expression information. For the post-childhood group, both the posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) encode facial emotion features from a high-dimensional, continuous space. However, in children, the facial expression information is only significantly represented in the pSTC, not in the DLPFC. Further, the encoding of complex emotions in pSTC is shown to increase with age. Taken together, these data suggest that young children rely more on low-level sensory areas than on the prefrontal cortex for facial emotion processing, leading us to hypothesize that top-down modulation from prefrontal cortex to pSTC gradually matures during development to enable a full understanding of facial emotions, especially complex emotions which need social and life experience to comprehend.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

J.; Chen, Y.-C.; Desplan, C.", "abstract": "Optimal neural processing relies on precise tissue patterning across diverse cell types. Here, we show that spontaneous calcium waves arise among non-neuronal support cells in the developing Drosophila eye to drive retinal morphogenesis. Waves are initiated by Cad96Ca receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, triggering PLCgamma-mediated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. A cell-type-specific Innexin-code coordinates wave propagation through a defined gap junction network among non-neuronal retinal cells, excluding photoreceptors. Wave intensity scales with ommatidial size, triggering stronger Myosin II-driven apical contractions at interommatidial boundaries in larger ommatidia. This size-dependent mechanism compensates for early boundary irregularities, ensuring uniform ommatidial packing critical for precise optical architecture. Our findings reveal how synchronized calcium signaling among non-neuronal cells orchestrates tissue patterning in the developing nervous system.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Rather than fitting voltage traces, we fit the bifurcation structure of the target model, thereby capturing parameter heterogeneity and rich dynamics. The resulting model extends the quadratic integrate-and-fire model, with extracellular potassium accumulation altering voltage dynamics by increasing the reset voltage. We apply our systematic reduction procedure to the Wang-Buz&aacuteski model.

M.; Wilkinson, M. J.; Cooper, M.", "abstract": "While many genomic prediction models have been evaluated for their potential to accelerate genetic gain for multiple traits, no individual genomic prediction model has outperformed others across all applications. This result aligns with the implications of the No Free Lunch Theorem, stating that the average performance of individual prediction models becomes equivalent across the state space of diverse prediction scenarios. While no individual prediction model outperforms all others, ensembles of multiple individual genomic prediction models can be applied to leverage their complementary strengths. The Diversity Prediction Theorem provides a framework for investigating the reduction in prediction error through the inclusion of diverse prediction models in the ensemble. We used the EasiGP (Ensemble AnalySis with Interpretable Genomic Prediction) software to investigate the performance of an ensemble approach, targeting flowering time traits measured in two maize nested association mapping datasets. For both datasets, the ensemble-based prediction approach achieved the highest prediction accuracy and lowest prediction error across traits. Multiple genomic regions containing key flowering time-related genes were included as features in the different genomic prediction models with diverse weights among the individual models, demonstrating different views of the trait genetic architecture. The Diversity Prediction Theorem framework suggests that the ensemble combination of such diverse views likely contributed to the improvement of prediction performance by the ensemble-based approach over the individual prediction models. Exploiting the expectations of the Diversity Prediction Theorem, ensemble-based prediction can be applied to overcome some limitations proposed by the No Free Lunch Theorem when applying individual genomic prediction models.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, resistance arises often in parallel and through alternative mechanisms creating challenges to predict emergence. In agriculture, where vast areas are sprayed by diverse cocktails, antifungal resistance gains are particularly complex. Despite broad efforts, knowledge of resistance mechanisms is often limited to model genotypes and empirical evidence from the field is lacking. Here, we define and validate a high-throughput pipeline for antifungal resistance discovery informed by emerging resistance gains at continental scale. We analyzed a thousand-genome European diversity panel of the major wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and assessed resistance levels against over 29 fungicides covering all major classes. We optimized high-throughput phenotyping assays to comprehensively capture emerging resistance phenotypes. Pangenome-informed genotyping techniques revealed a total of 2192 genes associated with antifungal resistance. This expands by an order of magnitude the current knowledge and establishes a refined atlas of resistance mutations. We generated mutants to recapitulate several of the discovered resistance factors. Hence, our approach captures in-field resistance gains across Europe for all major fungicide classes and can define exact molecular targets.

While tobacco exposure is an established risk factor for PDAC incidence and influences patient survival, the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating these effects remain poorly understood. We aimed to characterize the causal pathways linking tobacco exposure to PDAC patient survival, focusing on DNA methylation and tumor immune infiltration as potential mediators. For this purpose, we developed HDMAX2-surv, an extension of high-dimensional mediation analysis method HDMAX2, adapted to survival outcomes. Through extensive simulations across multiple scenarios, we demonstrated superior performance compared to existing methods in handling complex DNA methylation data. We integrated this approach with causal discovery frameworks and immune deconvolution algorithms to dissect multi-pathway mediation mechanisms. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort of 145 PDAC patients, we identified 37 aggregated methylated regions (AMRs) with significant mediation effects, exhibiting both protective and deleterious impacts on survival. Our causal discovery analysis revealed complex relationships where tobacco effects operate through sequential pathways involving DNA methylation and immune infiltration changes. Serial mediation analysis identified four distinct pathways where tobacco-induced epigenetic modifications mediate survival effects through immune microenvironment alterations, involving the ZBTB42, CLGN, RAD51AP2, and PRDM16 loci. Remarkably, these effects were undetectable through gene expression analysis alone, highlighting the unique value of methylation-based approaches. This study provides dual contributions: methodologically, through an integrated framework for high-dimensional survival mediation analysis with causal discovery; and biologically, by elucidating complex molecular mechanisms through which tobacco exposure influences PDAC outcomes.

Yeast has been an invaluable model for elucidating the functions of P-bodies under laboratory conditions. However, the physiological significance of P-bodies in natural environments remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that P-body formation is required for yeast proliferation in the phyllosphere, the aerial parts of plants. Deletion of EDC3, a gene critical for P-body formation, impaired proliferation of the methanol-utilizing yeast Candida boidinii on Arabidopsis thaliana leaves where the yeast assimilates methanol as the carbon source while adapting to changes in environmental conditions. In vitro experiments showed that P-bodies contribute to the spatiotemporal regulation of methanol-induced mRNAs (mimRNAs). These mimRNAs form cytosolic dot structures (termed mimRNA granules) that harbor multiple kinds of mimRNAs. In the edc3{Delta} strain, the formation of mimRNA granules was reduced along with a decrease in mimRNA abundance. Under oxidative stress, colocalization of P-bodies with mimRNA granules markedly increased and growth of the edc3{Delta} strain on methanol was suppressed, suggesting active sequestration of mimRNAs within P-bodies as a stress tolerance response. Time-lapse microscopy revealed dynamic interactions between P-bodies and mimRNAs granules with transient colocalization. Together, our findings indicate that P-bodies function as temporal storage sites where mimRNAs are protected from degradation in the phyllosphere.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Some of the most promising antigen targets for antibacterial mAbs are surface polysaccharides such as O-antigen, a component of the lipopolysaccharide found on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. However, developing mAbs against bacterial surface polysaccharides with sufficient breadth and potency to be clinically viable is difficult in part because antibodies against polysaccharides are generally low affinity, and the challenging biochemistry of polysaccharides often precludes further affinity maturation of mAbs against these targets in vitro. Here, we use a phage display library and a whole-cell in-solution panning strategy to successfully improve the affinity of a mAb against Shigella flexneri 3a O-antigen (O-Ag) in vitro without requiring the purification of the target antigen. We demonstrate that a single mutation can improve apparent affinity approximately 10-fold without detectably increasing polyreactivity, and increased affinity correlates with enhanced potency in antibacterial effector function and anti-virulence assays. In addition, the most potent variants also gained increased breadth, successfully coordinating complement deposition and complement-independent opsonophagocytosis against S. flexneri 3b, a serotype weakly recognized by the parent mAb. Altogether, this work represents an important first step towards expanding the antibody engineering toolkit for bacterial surface polysaccharides, which will aid the development of novel mAb therapeutics against AMR bacterial pathogens.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

We found that neural populations in the midbrain optic tectum and dorsal thalamus are activated by the rapid escape of social partners. These neurons are also driven by the sudden disappearance of virtual social partners, yet unaffected by disappearing stimuli without social relevance. Virtual fish schools that escape or disappear were sufficient to cause observers to escape, even in the absence of direct threats. These results demonstrate that rapid social-off detection in visual circuits enables the detection of socially transmitted threat information, which may be a particularly effective strategy for animals capable of rapid movement but limited visual range.

In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a diverse panel of 288 Vitis spp. accessions from the Agronomic Institute Germplasm Bank, Brazil. This panel was phenotyped for six critical cluster architecture traits over 12 years and genotyped using the Vitis18k SNP array.

Four closely spaced markers on Chr1 suggest the presence of a QTL influencing five traits simultaneously. A strong association signal, explaining approximately 29-35% of the phenotypic variance (PVE), indicated a major QTL for berry length (BL) and width (BWi) on Chr14.

We examined the conscious consequences of a sub-threshold manipulation of the square trajectories, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the cerebellum (right CRUS I/II) to study the modulation of the processing of the trajectory manipulations. The TMS was a typical intermittent thetaburst stimulation, but only one sequence of around 3 minutes, compared with a placebo stimulation. The trajectory manipulation had a reliable effect on the illusion, even though the illusion emerged within less than 100 ms after the trajectory manipulation. The results suggest that the prediction is temporarily stopped after the trajectory change. The illusion was accompanied by EEG signals whose amplitude was modulated by TMS on the cerebellum, at least in those participants who received verum TMS after having performed the task three times.

Frontal theta reflected task-specific control processes, whereas parietal alpha/beta indexed domain-general attentional processes that persisted from cue onset through target processing -consistent with two stage-models of task switching. Notably, flexibility-related alpha/beta dynamics did not correlate with measures of intelligence or working memory capacity (WMC), underscoring the distinctiveness of cognitive flexibility from general cognitive abilities.

Results showed that both target-coherent AV and Inter visual conditions offer participants a listening benefit over the static image audio-only condition, with the full AV target-coherent condition providing the most benefit. Lipreading ability correlated with the audiovisual benefit shown in the full AV target-coherent condition, but not the benefit in the Inter target-coherent condition.

These models generalize remarkably well to new environments, but it is unclear how neural circuits acquire this flexibility. Here, we show that compositional representations emerge in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained solely to predict future sensory inputs. These representations have been observed in different areas of the brain, for example, in the motor cortex of monkeys, which have been shown to reuse primitives in sequences. They enable compositional generalization, a mechanism that could explain the brain's adaptability, where independent modules representing different parts of the environment can be selected according to context. We trained an RNN to predict future frames in a visual environment defined by independent latent factors and their corresponding dynamics. We found that the network learned to solve this task by developing a compositional internal model. Specifically, it had disentangled representations of the static latent factors, and formed distinct, modular clusters, each selectively implementing a single dynamic. This modular and disentangled architecture enabled the network to exhibit compositional generalization, accurately predicting outcomes in novel contexts composed of unseen combinations of dynamics. Our findings present a powerful, unsupervised mechanism for learning the causal structure of an environment, suggesting that predicting the future can be sufficient to develop generalizable world models.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Biomarker-based diagnostic tools for early detection and targeted treatments have yet to be developed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are critical regulators of genes involved in brain development and function, are emerging as promising candidates as molecular mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets for ASD. This study aimed to identify miRNAs involved in ASD and evaluate their potential functions through in silico analysis. Methods: A comprehensive analysis was performed to find genomic variants with a predicted functional impact on miRNA activity. Using large datasets of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs, N = 4300) and Copy Number Variants (CNVs, N = 3570) from ASD cases, we identified miRNAs targeted by CNVs or containing SNVs predicted to disrupt their function in ASD subjects, and compared their frequencies with controls. Selected regulatory miRNA-mRNA networks and their associated biological functions were characterized. Results: Seventy mature miRNAs were identified, including both previously reported and novel ASD candidates, predicted to regulate 2742 brain-expressed genes. Enrichment analysis revealed their involvement in cellular signaling, transcription regulation, protein metabolism, and chromatin organization - biological processes strongly related to ASD. Notably, 63% of these miRNAs are predicted to target 71 known ASD risk genes and the KCNB1, MECP2, NCKAP1 and ZBTB20 genes are each regulated by at least four miRNAs. Conclusions: This gene-based analysis identified miRNAs regulating gene networks and biological pathways implicated in brain function and plasticity, frequently disrupted in ASD. These findings strengthen the evidence for miRNA involvement in ASD, paving the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Engineered MCF7 cells expressing HER2 proteoforms - full-length p185HER2 or truncated 611-CTF - were evaluated on the impact of such proteoforms after lapatinib or doxorubicin exposure. Expression of 611-CTF elicits pervasive chromatin remodeling, whereas p185HER2 provokes only modest accessibility shifts under the same treatments. Lapatinib treatment produces limited global effects but unmasks proteoform-specific responses, while treatment with doxorubicin drives extensive genome-wide accessibility changes. Concordance between chromatin accessibility and protein abundance is moderate, underscoring complex regulatory coupling. Extending this dual-modality approach to HER2-low patient-derived organoids uncovers distinct chromatin states and reveals a subpopulation of triple-negative breast-cancer cells expressing truncated HER2 proteoforms.

Cisplatin eradicated the cancer cells by generating lethal DNA lesions, which can be recognized and processed by a variety of proteins, including the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein. HMGB1 is a multifunctional protein, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage repair. In this study, we investigated the role of HMGB1 in modulating cisplatin sensitivity in human ovarian cancer cells. Using siRNA-mediated HMGB1 knockdown in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cell lines, we observed that HMGB1 depletion reduced colony formation and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the cisplatin-resistant cells. Mechanistically, HMGB1-depleted cells exhibited altered DNA damage responses by mediating the ATM/CHK2 and ATR/CHK1 activity following cisplatin treatment. Slot blot and modified alkaline comet assay further demonstrated that HMGB1 depletion stimulated cisplatin-DNA adduct formation and impaired adduct removal. Collectively, these findings uncover novel functions of HMGB1 in mediating cisplatin sensitivity, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target to overcome cisplatin resistance.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that the landscape of physiological DSBs in BRCAmut mammary epithelial cells differs from that of healthy controls and resemble more the DSB pattern observed in breast cancer cells. Our results reveal that proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors contain more breaks in BRCAmut samples, and that genes with a high number of DSBs tend to be more highly expressed. These genes containing a high number of DSBs are also often mutated in breast cancer tumors. Finally, genes with high DSBs in mammary epithelial cells from women with BRCAmut exhibit a strong correlation with homologous recombination repair.

We find that replication fork progression rates are not uniform throughout the genome. Rather, fork progression is slowest in euchromatin, and this is not correlated with active transcription. Replication origins are also influenced by chromatin, but the exact position of initiation is highly variable and are often several kilobases away from ORC binding sites.

J.", "abstract": "Lysosomes are organelles responsible for degrading unwanted extracellular material that cells internalize, or intracellular material targeted for disposal. Typically, lysosomes are globular in morphology. However, in activated macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharides, lysosomes undergo a dramatic reorganization to expand and become tubular in morphology. This tubulation phenomenon requires microtubules and dynein and kinesin motor activities regulated by lysosomal Rab7 and Arl8b GTPases. A key property of lysosomes is their acidic milieu established by the V-ATPase; the acidic gradient across the lysosomal membrane is ideal for hydrolytic activity, but this also powers other functions including membrane transport. Here, we sought to determine if V-ATPase and the acidic lysosomal pH were important for LPS-mediated lysosome tubulation in macrophages. We found that disruption of the V-ATPase prevented lysosome tubulation and collapsed preformed tubules. However, the V-ATPase also controls mTORC1 activity, which we previously showed promotes tubulation. In comparison, alkalization with NH4Cl did not interfere with mTORC1 activity, and yet, this also prevented lysosome tubulation. Moreover, clamping the pH to either acidic or alkaline values caused tubules to collapse, indicating that the gradient across the membrane is required for tubulation, rather than a specific pH value. Dissipation of lysosomal pH did not alter global microtubule organization, nor did it cause a collapse of lysosome movement, suggesting that motors remained associated with lysosomes. Interestingly, while LPS did not alter the global lysosomal pH nor the average pH of spherical and tubular lysosomes, we observed that growing tubules typically had a more acidic peripheral tip. We propose that localized gradients of acidic pH across the lysosomal membrane may directly or indirectly coordinate motor activity to enable tubulation.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

The resolution gain is even higher in nanoscopic methods, due to higher obtainable resolution and slower acquisition speed, rendering cryo-nanoscopy promising even beyond CLEM. However, cryogenic nanoscopy is often limited by heating and devitrification of the sample through strong laser irradiation, with drastic differences in reported tolerable power densities. We therefore investigated the laser-induced heating in different setups for cryogenic nanoscopy by time-dependent finite-element simulations complemented with absorption measurements of mammalian cells. Laser-induced heating happened in milliseconds, precluding efficient sample preservation by most intermittent illuminations. Under moderate light densities used for single molecule localization microscopy, absorbance by mammalian cells was too weak to explain devitrification and heating is governed by absorption of supporting material. However, the much higher power densities used in stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy resulted in temperatures clearly above the devitrification temperature from absorption by cells alone, unless the sample was mounted on an efficient heat exchanger, such as a diamond.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated how OSM drives CCM by comparing its effects with those elicited by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interferon gamma (IFNG), defining ligand-specific phenotypes and molecular networks. Integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1A) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as central regulators of OSM responses. Functional validation revealed that HIF1A drives transcriptional programs associated with hypoxia, metabolic reprogramming, and immune pathways. Complement signaling emerged as a downstream effector of HIF1A, and its inhibition disrupted OSM-induced clustering and CCM. These findings establish a mechanistic link between OSM signaling, HIF1A activation, and CCM, demonstrating how cytokine-driven transcriptional reprogramming coordinates epithelial migration.

We then characterized the spatial neighborhoods of megakaryocytes, illustrating their topological embedding within vascular, stromal, and immune microenvironments. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of this dataset for hypothesis-driven signaling studies by examining ligand-receptor interactions across pathways including BMP, VEGF, and ECM-integrin signaling.

Here, using super-resolution microscopy, we visualised the presence of microtubules alongside F-actin in most TZPs. Knockout (KO) mice of the microtubule minus-end binding protein Camsap3 (calmodulinregulated spectrin-associated protein 3) exhibited infertility with fewer developing late-stage follicles. In earlier stages of Camsap3-KO follicles, the number of TZPs was reduced compared to that in wild-type follicles, and microtubules in TZPs were disorganised, which led to a decrease in physical contact between GCs and oocytes. We also found that TZP morphology in wild-type follicles transforms over time during follicle development, and Camsap3 modulates TZP morphology by assisting the organisation of microtubules as well as F-actin.

The more than doubling of a cells nuclear genome by endoreplication has been found to be an adaptation to genotoxic stress, enabling cell survival despite DNA damage. However, it remains unknown whether cells that increase ploidy via multinucleation also arise in response to genotoxic stress. Here, we use ultraviolet light A (UV-A) to induce permanent DNA damage in cells within the adult fruit fly epithelium. UV-A irradiation causes an injury-like response where giant multinucleated, polyploid cells arise following cell death. The epithelial cells undergo endoreplication, which is required to restore tissue mass, but is surprisingly dispensable for tissue repair. UV-A irradiation also induces cell fusion, which generates multinucleated cells that encompass almost the entire epithelial area post injury. Cell fusion can be inhibited by expression of a dominant negative Rac or Cdc42 GTPase, which then blocks epithelial tissue repair post irradiation. Apoptotic nuclei were detected at the site of cell junction breakdown suggesting that apoptosis itself or an apoptotic signal is required for polyploidization in this model. Expression of the effector caspase inhibitor, p35, led to inhibition of apoptosis, the endocycle, and cell fusion post UV-A. Therefore, we have discovered that caspase activation is necessary for polyploidization post injury and enhancing cell ploidy via multinucleation is another strategy to enable cell survival and tissue repair following genotoxic stress.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

In solution, PIP5K exists in a weak monomer-dimer equilibrium but undergoes membrane-mediated dimerization, which potentiates lipid kinase activity. In vivo, however, PI(4,5)P2 levels are held remarkably constant due to the homeostatic regulation of PIP5K by PIP4K. We hypothesized that mechanisms that regulate PIP5K dimerization could function to buffer lipid kinase activity, thus providing a mechanism for maintaining relatively constant PI(4,5)P2 levels at the plasma membrane. Due the transient nature and density dependence of PIP5K dimerization, deciphering how other proteins modulate PIP5K dimerization has not been feasible. To address this limitation, we established a single molecule FRET assay to visualize membrane-mediated homodimerization and heterodimerization of PIP5K paralogs on supported lipid bilayers using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRF-M). Using this approach, we find that PIP4K attenuates PIP5K lipid kinase activity by disrupting membrane-mediated dimerization. Guided by structure prediction, we generated PIP4K mutants that are unable to disrupt PIP5K membrane-mediated dimerization thus preventing the attenuation lipid kinase activity. In vivo, mutations that disrupt the PIP4K-PIP5K interaction similarly prevent PIP4K-mediated inhibition of the PIP5K activity.

By combining these results with those of computational simulations, we find that light scattering arises via two components that exhibit distinct angular and spatial distributions: volume scattering within the body and surface scattering at the boundaries between the worm and its surroundings. We elucidated how volume and surface scattering interact with each other and collectively contribute to the overall scattering. Informed by these findings, we determined the illumination angle range, wavelength range, and substrate material that optimize imaging contrast. Our findings provide practical strategies for optimizing image quality across a range of imaging systems.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

J.; Li, C.; Li, J.; Rusinek, H.; Ge, Y.; Zhang, J.", "abstract": "The structural changes accompanying brain aging exhibit complex, multifaceted patterns that challenge traditional analytical approaches and impede accurate assessment of individual brain health. While previous studies have documented these age-related changes, integrating findings across multiple brain structures to assess individual brain age status has proven difficult due to the high-dimensional nature of neuroimaging data. Using structural MRI data from the Human Connectome Project Aging Dataset, we demonstrate that age-related regional volume changes can be mapped onto a low-dimensional manifold that reflects underlying neuroanatomical constraints. This manifold representation provides a transparent framework for both assessing an individual's overall brain aging status and identifying specific regional changes that drive this assessment. By examining data within neighborhoods on the manifold, we identified distinct structural changes within anatomically homogeneous subgroups, including pronounced frontal atrophy that was observed primarily in male participants. These local patterns can be aggregated to create a comprehensive picture of how an individual brain ages, providing new insights into the heterogeneous nature of brain aging.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

This study explored the pathophysiological features and their biomechanical manifestations at different stages of MASH in a mouse dietary model. Methods: Using MRE on a clinical 3 Tesla MRI scanner, we measured liver stiffness, viscosity, fat fraction and water diffusion in 45 male mice. These values were correlated with histopathology and proteomics analyses to further characterize the liver microstructural and metabolic changes during MASH progression. Results: We found in a high-fat, low amino-acid model that early MASH was marked by fat accumulation and increasing inflammatory activity, while later stages showed a reduction in fat despite persistent inflammation. These changes in microstructure were associated with biomechanical adaptations, including a progressive decrease in hepatic viscosity and the water diffusion. Notably, viscosity was inversely correlated with lobular inflammation, cell adhesion, antioxidant activity, and metabolic adaptations such as enhanced ketone body synthesis. These findings, which precede the onset of fibrosis and tissue stiffening, show that tissue viscosity is highly sensitive to early microstructural and metabolic alterations in MASH. Conclusion: Steatosis and inflammation significantly alter liver biophysical properties, particularly viscosity, in a mouse dietary model of MASH, even in the absence of fibrosis. These findings suggest that viscosity is a potential early and clinically translatable biomarker for the development and progression of MASH.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

The immunomodulatory effects of 7 nAChR signaling in human immune cells is complicated by the presence of the human-specific duplicated 7 (dup7) subunit. Here, we investigated the expression and function of nAChRs in human Jurkat T cells, focusing on 7, dup7, 9, and 10. Quantitative PCR revealed transcripts for all four subunits. Mitogenic stimulation with PMA, ionomycin, and ConA significantly downregulated 7, 9, and 10 expression while upregulating dup7, suggesting dynamic remodeling of receptor composition during T cell activation. Functional assays showed that 7 antagonism with ArIB[V11L,V16D] strongly suppressed mitogen-induced IL-2 and TNF- secretion, while nicotine pretreatment produced more modest reductions. Flow cytometry confirmed a decreased frequency of IL-2+ cells following treatment with nicotine or nAChR antagonists. These findings establish Jurkat cells as a tractable model for studying nAChR signaling in human T cells. Our results demonstrate that 7-containing nAChRs positively regulate cytokine production, while dup7 expression increases during activation and may act as a negative regulator of 7 function. Together, these data highlight nAChRs as key modulators of T cell activity and potential therapeutic targets for regulating adaptive immunity.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Using bispecific antibodies to target anti-PD-1 to individual T cell subsets, we demonstrate that intratumoral CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can independently drive immune remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. The CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that respond to anti-PD-1 exhibit a shared dysfunctional gene program, characterized by tumor-reactivity, terminal exhaustion, effector capacity, and reduced translational activity. Notably, rather than acting through transcriptional rewiring, anti-PD-1 reinvigorates dysfunctional T cells by overcoming this translational barrier, resulting in restored effector function.

Our approach begins with fine-tuning the protein language model ESM-2 on antigen-specific TCR datasets via LoRA to capture discriminative sequence representations. We then construct a heterogeneous interaction graph in which nodes encode sequence features and edges denote interaction relationships. By integrating sequence and structural information through a graph learning framework, LoFT-TCR enhances predictive accuracy. Systematic experiments show that ESM-2 fine-tuning significantly improves the extraction of informative TCR sequence features, which are essential for accurate specificity prediction.

S.; Sanford, E.", "abstract": "Although species geographic distributions are increasingly shifting poleward with climate change, the processes that facilitate or impede range shifts are poorly understood. More extreme environmental conditions near poleward range boundaries often impose reproductive constraints, which may limit fitness and future range expansion. However, few studies evaluate the extent to which adaptive evolution and/or phenotypic plasticity might mitigate the effects of reproductive constraints and contribute to successful range shifts. We examined reproductive trait variation across the geographic range of Acanthinucella spirata, an intertidal snail that has recently expanded poleward along the coast of California, USA. We found that, compared to the range core, A. spirata from cooler range-edge populations allocated approximately 16x more nurse eggs to each developing embryo and had larger offspring at hatching, which may lead to greater juvenile growth rates and survival. Furthermore, range-edge A. spirata populations had lower fecundity, highlighting a potential tradeoff between offspring size and number. Some trait differences between range-core and range-edge populations persisted in an 18-month common-garden experiment, consistent with the hypothesis that such traits may be under selection. This study suggests that life-history adaptations in range-edge populations are an important and understudied mechanism that may contribute to species' range expansions.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

In aid of this, much progress has been made in quantifying the functional impact of individual variants on the gene product it codes for. However, the intolerance of the sequence in which those variants are found to functional variation is also a key determinant of whether a deleterious variant is pathogenic or not. Previous approaches to estimating genic intolerance have combined functional variant types, i.e., missense, loss-of-function, etc., or restricted analyses to only one type, i.e., pLI, missense-Z etc. Here we take a different approach and jointly model patterns of intolerance across multiple functional variant types. We refer to this approach as CATMINT. We show that CATMINT is competitive with previous gene level intolerance metrics in predicting disease relevant genes, with CATMINT ranking among the top performing scores across differing types of genes. However, perhaps more exciting is that CATMINT enables variant category specific intolerance estimation, revealing distinct functional profiles across genes/gene families. Analysis of ClinVar data shows that CATMINT intolerance patterns in disease genes recapitulate patterns of pathogenic variants within those genes, supporting the utility of category-specific intolerance in clinical variant interpretation. Further, we use the statistical framework utilized by CATMINT to conduct power analyses, allowing us to classify genes according to the power those genes have to detect intolerance. This allows us, for example, to identify genes that are underpowered and undetected, but may nevertheless be highly intolerant. Together, these results define a framework for understanding how selective pressures shape gene-specific sensitivity to different classes of mutation, improving the resolution of variant interpretation and gene prioritization in clinical and functional genomics.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Here we identify IKK{beta} and NR4A1 as two closely related drivers of AML progression and develop a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) drug that has dual degradation activity against IKK{beta} and NR4A1. IKK{beta} and its downstream nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) signaling are aberrantly activated in around 40% AML patients. However, nearly all IKK{beta} inhibitors have failed prior clinical trials due to their serious side effects such as neutrophilia and systematic inflammation. As opposed to the previously reported tumor suppressive role in AML, we found that NR4A1 promotes AML pathogenesis in a context-dependent manner. Here we designed, synthesized, and validated several celastrol-based PROTACs, with one lead compound A9 that effectively kills several AML cell lines and primary human AML cells via the degradation of IKK{beta} and NR4A1. At the mechanistic level, A9 degrades both targets through cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase-mediated proteasomal system by forming ternary complexes with the target proteins and CRBN. More importantly, A9 attenuates AML disease progression in a clinically relevant KMT2A::MLLT3 mouse model and does not induce neutrophilia in vivo--a common side effect of IKK{beta} inhibitors.

Drosophila fruit flies and associated ectoparasitic mites interact across a range of microhabitats, typically in decaying organic matter, such as fallen fruit and cactus tissue, that dries out and deteriorates over periods ranging from days to months. Here, we report that mite parasitism of Drosophila increases with exposure to increasingly dry conditions for two fly-mite systems (D. nigrospiracula-Macrocheles and D. melanogaster-Gamasodes). In D. melanogaster, artificial selection for behavioral resistance did not eliminate this effect, as previously selected lines remained relatively more resistant than non-selected controls even under dry conditions. Water balance assays confirmed that mites became dehydrated when held under dry conditions, which was also associated with increased mite activity. Exposure of D. melanogaster to mites dehydrated by exposure to low relative humidity increased parasitism, further supporting that mite infestation intensifies under dry conditions. The results indicate that ectoparasitism in this system is affected by the water content of the mites. The increased motivation of mites to parasitise flies under dry conditions may serve to replenish mite water stores and facilitate dispersal to more favorable microhabitats.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Genetic mosaicism is a commonality of multicellular life and has been studied extensively in humans due to its associations with aging and diseases. In humans, somatic selection shapes the accumulation of somatic mutations, with strong signatures of positive somatic selection in cancer cell lineages. So far, evidence for somatic selection in plants has been inconsistent. The evolutionary implications of genetic mosaicism in humans and other animals are limited by early specification of germline cells, preventing transmission of somatic mutations to progeny. In contrast, many plant lineages reproduce asexually with clonal progeny derived from vegetative tissues. We describe the patterns and processes shaping somatic mutation accumulation within a single, 149-year-old historic sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) tree and within a clonal lineage of sweet orange. More than 12,000 somatic mutations were identified in the historic tree and 28,000 somatic mutations were identified across 199 clonally related sweet orange accessions. Both the spatial and genomic distributions of somatic mutations are non-random. The spatial patterns of somatic mutations across the historic tree depend on tree growth and development and their accumulation across the tree canopy recapitulates branching topology. Analysis of the genomic distribution of somatic mutations revealed that the subtelomeres, which are large arrays of ~180 bp repeats, are mutation hotspots. Finally, there was genomic evidence that somatic selection shapes the accumulation of somatic mutations both within the historic tree and also during clonal propagation.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

To lift this restriction, we introduce Pathogenicity K-Nearest Neighbors (P-KNN), a simple, flexible method that jointly calibrates any set of tools. P-KNN scores each variant by the fraction of pathogenic variants among those with the most similar scores across all underlying tools. We compared P-KNN to single-tool calibration over 13 real tools, including two meta-predictors. Compared to BayesDel, the best-performing tool, P-KNN produced better-calibrated probabilities and stronger evidence strength, with mean log likelihood ratios of 2.56 vs. 2.24 for pathogenic variants, 2.29 vs. 1.56 for benign variants, and 2.28 vs. 2.07 for variants of uncertain significance. We also evaluated P-KNN at four historical time points to assess scalability and robustness, finding that it improved steadily as new tools became available, while remaining well-calibrated. It also correctly integrated computational predictions with experimental measurements, whereas guidelines-based evidence summation systematically overestimated pathogenicity. In summary, P-KNN allows full flexibility to work with any set of tools in a reliable and robust manner.

Although it has been shown that RD induces melanocyte death in vitro, it is still not fully understood why melanocytes are gone by RD in vivo. Objective: This research aimed to investigate how melanocytes are eliminated in the animal model by RD. Methods: On the backs of black guinea pigs (JY-4) with epidermal melanocytes in the basal layer, 30% RD was administered topically three times per day, five days per week. Skin tissues were collected sequentially and histologically analyzed. Results: On day 21, L* values in the RD-applied skin were significantly higher than in the vehicle-applied skin. From day 1 to day 7, the number of TRP1-positive melanocytes and melanin in the basal layer decreased, but no TUNEL-positive melanocytes were identified. On the other hand, an accumulation of melanin was newly found in the dermis. Immunohistochemical staining identified several melanocytes in the upper dermis or spinous layer, away from the basement membrane. An investigation of the epidermal-dermal interface showed a structural anomaly in a portion of the basement membrane with elevated MMP2 expression and increased dermal fibroblasts. The application of the MMP2 inhibitor Ilomastat abolished the basement membrane abnormality by RD.

Here, we used low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 273 non-invasively collected samples (feathers and faeces) to comprehensively assess the status of this population. Feather samples yielded high-quality genomic data, enabling sex identification, estimation of genome-wide heterozygosity, runs of homozygosity (ROH), and relatedness inference. Heterozygosity levels in Tyresta were comparable to other European Western Capercaillie populations, and inbreeding levels were generally low, although several individuals showed long ROH indicative of recent close-kin mating. Population structure analyses revealed a genetically distinct and panmictic unit with evidence of female-biased dispersal. Kinship analysis uncovered a highly interconnected social network, with males having on average more relatives than females. Recapture simulations based on genotype matching estimated a current maximum population size of 164 - 208 individuals.

By modulating anchor density, the liposomes can be programmably localized on the surface or interior of the condensates, while base-pairing selectivity can be leveraged to target individual internal domains in multi-phasic condensates. The embedded liposomes can be released by adding a nucleic acid trigger and captured by a second condensate population, thus imitating extracellular vesicles in their ability to support long-range cellular communication.

Phylogenetic analysis of VirB4 sequences and synteny analysis revealed 16 distinct T4SS clusters in Ralstonia, with ten clusters found in RSSC phytopathogen genomes, twelve in non-RSSC environmental genomes, and six clusters in both groups. Collectively, these gene clusters were more prevalent in non-RSSC environmental genomes. The presence of type IV coupling protein and relaxase genes suggests that at least 14 of these T4SS gene clusters could be putative DNA conjugation systems. The clusters were encoded on accessory plasmids of various sizes or as integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) on the chromosome or megaplasmid. The putative regions of transfer for T4SS gene clusters in the RSSC phytopathogen genomes often contained type III effectors, type VI secretion toxin/antitoxin clusters, and hemagglutinin gene clusters. In contrast, the non-RSSC environmentals were enriched in heavy metal metabolism and resistance genes. One of the 16 T4SS clusters, cluster i, exhibited evidence of specialization and possible mutualism for the RSSC phytopathogens. These findings shed light on the eco-evolutionary differences in the Ralstonia genus.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

This study determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on 40 M. avium clinical strains, revealing that 97.5% (39/40) of the strains were intermediate (MIC=4 {micro}g/mL) or resistant (MIC[&ge;]8 {micro}g/mL) to EMB. One susceptible clinical isolate strain 245 (MIC=2 {micro}g/mL) was picked for EMB-resistant mutant isolation, and a total of 121 resistant mutants were isolated and subjected to whole-genome sequencing or Sanger sequencing. Integrated analysis revealed that 94.21% (114/121) of the mutants carried mutations in the ubiA gene, which encodes DPPR (decaprenylphosphoryl-{beta}-D-5-phosphoribose) synthase - an enzyme involved in cell wall biosynthesis that has been associated with high-level EMB resistance in M. tuberculosis. Complementation with the wild type ubiA gene restored EMB susceptibility in EMB-resistant mutants and clinical strain 322 (EMB MIC=64 {micro}g/mL) with ubiA mutation, reducing the MICs from 32 {micro}g/mL to 4 {micro}g/mL and from 64 {micro}g/mL to 8 {micro}g/mL, respectively.

Although existing analytical methods provide high sensitivity, they often require complex instrumentation with limited on-site applications, and generate hazardous waste, raising environmental concerns. At present, whole-cell biosensors provide an empirical alternative, utilizing cellular machinery for sensitive detection of metals. In a relevant context, intein-mediated protein splicing, a spontaneous post-translational process, can be adapted for biosensing by coupling metal-dependent splicing inhibition with whole-cell sensing units. Current research elucidates how toxic metal ions, including cadmium (Cd2+), mercury (Hg2+), chromium (Cr3+), and lead (Pb2+), influence the splicing and N-terminal cleavage reactions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) SufB precursor protein. While Cd2+; and Hg2+; significantly attenuated the splicing activity of Mtb SufB precursor protein over a concentration range of 25 uM to 2 mM, Pb2+; and Cr3+; failed to do so. Next, an innovative biosensor platform was designed to detect these metal ions by utilizing splicing inhibition in metal-sensitive Mtb SufB precursor protein within attenuated Mtb (H37Ra) cells. Metal-induced splicing inhibition led to loss of viability in H37Ra indicator cells, while specificity of this detection system was confirmed by adding respective metal chelators. Multiplexing and quantitative efficacy of the designed biosensor was evaluated by including known splicing inhibitors like Cu2+, Zn2+, and Pt4+ over various concentration range alongside Cd2+; and Hg2+;. The developed biosensor offers a cost-effective, user-friendly, specific, and sensitive assay that does not require advanced instrumentation facility. It can be employed in standard biological laboratories utilizing whole-cell microorganisms harbouring precursor proteins with metal-sensing intein sequences. This approach holds potential for multiplexing metal screening in environmental and industrial effluents, significantly enhancing toxic metal monitoring capabilities.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

One major way in which eukaryotic cells sense their surroundings is via G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), which share a seven-transmembrane architecture and G-protein-mediated downstream signaling. While mammalian GPCRs are well-characterized and represent important drug targets, their fungal counterparts remain poorly understood. In the corn pathogen Ustilago maydis, we now uncover a GPCR-based mechanism that allows the fungus to scout the host environment to sense whether it has entered into the plant tissue. During infection, the fungus secretes the protein Pit2, which is cleaved by host apoplastic-cysteine proteases, releasing a peptide ligand hidden within Pit2. This ligand activates the fungal GPCR Gpe1 strongly promoting fungal proliferation after initial host penetration. Comparative analyses reveal conservation of the Gpe1/Pit2 system, with co-evolutionary signatures preserving receptor-ligand specificity. Furthermore, this GPCR system recognizing hidden peptide ligands shows conceptual similarities to the fungal pheromone mating system, without sharing sequence similarity. Our findings reveal a co-evolved mechanism between fungus and host that encodes environmental context into a protein scaffold, establishing a novel paradigm for host-dependent signaling with implications for inter-organismic communication.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

While its genome-wide occupancy has primarily been linked to transcriptional regulation, its potential role in DNA replication control remains less well defined. In this study, we investigated BRG1 involvement in replication origin regulation by integrating BRG1 ChIP-seq data with replication origin mapping and chromatin state analyses. Our results revealed that BRG1 is preferentially enriched at genomic regions characterized by DNase I hypersensitivity, low GC content, and a capacity to form G-quadruplex structures hallmarks of dormant replication origins. Notably, BRG1-bound sites were also enriched in late-replicating, heterochromatic regions. These findings suggest a specific association of BRG1 with dormant replication origins. To validate this association, we performed functional assays in HeLa cells. BRG1 depletion via siRNA led to reduced replication fork progression and increased activation of dormant origins, consistent with replication stress. Mechanistically, we found that BRG1 physically interacts with the mitotic kinase PLK1. Loss of BRG1 reduced chromatin-bound levels of both BRG1 and PLK1, implicating BRG1 in PLK1 recruitment or stability. Importantly, overexpression of PLK1 in BRG1-depleted cells rescued replication fork progression, supporting a cooperative role for BRG1 and PLK1 in regulating replication through dormant origins.

Yet the precise mode of action of its active form, pyrazinoic acid (HPOA), remains unclear. In this study, we comprehensively explore and challenge the two major and conflicted models of PZA mode of action. The pH-dependent model, where the drug is mostly effective at acidic pH by acidifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cytosol, and the PanD-dependent model where PZA active form targets the aspartate decarboxylase PanD, therefore depleting pantothenate and subsequently coenzyme A (CoA) levels regardless of the surrounding pH. By combining standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing at various pH with fluorescence-based live recording of Mtb intrabacterial pH, we demonstrate that PZA kills Mtb by decreasing intrabacterial pH, independently of pantothenate levels. Comparative studies between a prototrophic Mtb strain and a pantothenate auxotrophic mutant lacking the panCD locus confirmed that PZA bactericidal activity is primarily driven by pH and its ability to acidify Mtb cytosol, independently of the aspartate decarboxylase PanD. Bio-electrophysiology experiments revealed that acidic pH promotes the conversion of the pyrazinoate anion POA- into HPOA which in turn acts as conventional weak acid that facilitates membrane permeation and cytosolic acidification. Finally, using custom-based culture media, we demonstrate that PZA displays heterogeneous efficacy according to the media composition, therefore proposing a revisited biological model that might explain the discrepancies around PZA unique mode of action. Overall, this work constitutes the first comprehensive side-by-side investigation of the two models and univocally supports a pH-dependent mechanism of action underlying PZA sterilizing activity, providing new insights for the development of more effective PZA-like drugs.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Understanding the mechanism behind OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides spp. is necessary to determine their role in the gut. Recent studies showed that mutation of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 1 increased OMV production in Bacteroides thetaeotaomicron (Bt) by regulating members of its downstream regulon. Additional members of the Dma family have been identified, but very little is known regarding their roles in Bt. Here, we investigate the role of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 2 (Dma2) in controlling OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employ biochemical and proteomic analyses to show that mutation of dma2 increases OMV production in a manner that is dependent on the expression of its cognate sigma factor, das2. The precise mechanism by which dma2 increases OMV biogenesis remains elusive. However, transcriptome analyses revealed that {Delta}dma2 has decreased expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that primarily target host-associated glycans. Follow-up comparative proteomics showed that the PUL repertoire was most impacted in the OMV fraction. In vitro growth assessments showed that {Delta}dma2 exhibits delayed growth in the presence of select host-associated glycans. Colonization studies in mice revealed that {Delta}dma2 is outcompeted by the wild-type in the gut, which indicates that dma2 is a key determinant of colonization fitness in Bt.

Denitrifying bacteria have been leveraged for the in-situ removal of nitrate in groundwater. However, co-existing stressors--like low pH--reduce the efficacy of biological removal processes. Castellaniella sp. str. MT123 is a complete denitrifier that was isolated from acidic, nitrate-contaminated groundwater. The strain grows robustly by nitrate respiration at pH < 6.0 completely reducing nitrate to dinitrogen gas. Genomic analyses of MT123 revealed few previously characterized acid tolerance genes. Thus, we utilized a combination of proteomics, metabolomics, and competitive mutant fitness to characterize the genetic mechanisms of MT123 acclimation to growth under mildly acidic conditions. We found that glutamate accumulation is critical in the acid acclimation of MT123, likely through consumption of intracellular protons via glutamate decarboxylation to GABA. This is despite the fact that MT123 lacks the canonical glutamate decarboxylase-glutamate/GABA antiporter system implicated in acid tolerance in other bacteria. Additionally, branched chain amino acid (BCAA) accumulation was detrimental to cell growth at lower pHs, possibly through indirect mechanisms impacting the cellular glutamate pool. Genetic analysis previously linked MT123 to a population of Castellaniella that bloomed--concurrent to nitrate removal--during a biostimulation effort to reduce groundwater nitrate concentrations at MT123's location of origin. Thus, our analyses provide novel insight into mechanisms of acclimation to acidic conditions in a strain with significant potential for nitrate bioremediation.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Urinary E. coli isolates lacking a functional cysB gene have been shown to be resistant to the {beta}-lactam antibiotic mecillinam under high-osmolarity conditions, suggesting that increased fluid intake might synergize with drug treatment. In this study, we further explore E. coli susceptibility to mecillinam across growth conditions. We show that while osmolarity has mild protective effects on both cysB knockout and reference strain, it is the presence of certain salts that leads to the resistant phenotype in the mutant. Such conditional resistance is specific to mecillinam and rapidly wanes when salts are removed. In agreement with our previous work showing that slow growing cells escape mecillinam-induced bursting by maintaining a small size, for both strains we observe low susceptibility to mecillinam in scarcely nutritious pooled human urine. As we supplement urine with nutrients, we observe a sharp transition to susceptibility when growth rate surpasses 0.6 h-1. Growth in the presence of salt or uncharged osmolites decreases cell size of both reference strain and cysB knockout offering a potential explanation to the observed mild protective effects of osmolarity. Our findings give insights into the mechanism of cysB dependent susceptibility to mecillinam and, due to the dual impact of nutrients and osmolites on treatment, allow us to reformulate ideas on potential diet recommendations. While increased fluid intake will decrease urine osmolarity, it will also reduce nutrient content, limiting mecillinam efficacy.

This ambiguity can be resolved by scanning samples for a biomarker of human respiratory emissions. To do so, reliable biomarkers for environmental monitoring need to be identified. Ideal biomarkers are prevalent across individuals, abundant, and unique to the human respiratory tract. Here, we present a new machine learning-based approach to query for suitable biomarker candidates from publicly available metagenomes and apply it to identify viral biomarkers of healthy oral and nasal microbiomes. Twelve viral biomarker candidates were selected from 1,232 curated viral operational taxonomic units.

Improved therapeutics and vaccines are urgently needed to treat and prevent pertussis disease. Host recognition of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN), including B. pertussis extracellular PGN fragment tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), shapes the immune response to infection. Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRPs) are a conserved family of innate immune molecules which bind bacterial PGN. While they function as immune signaling receptors in arthropods, PGLYRPs in mammals have thus far been primarily recognized for their bactericidal activity. Previously thought to function only as antimicrobial peptides in mammals, the immune modulatory roles of this family of peptidoglycan recognition proteins are beginning to gain greater appreciation. Peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1) is a secreted antimicrobial protein. However, its role in mammalian host defenses and immune signaling during infection with Gram-negative pathogens, such as B. pertussis, remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a dual role for PGLYRP1 in modulating host immune responses to B. pertussis. Using knockout mice, single-cell and bulk transcriptomics and functional assays, we show that PGLYRP1 has bactericidal activity against B. pertussis in vitro and promotes early bacterial control in vivo. PGLYRP1 also dampens inflammatory responses and impedes bacterial killing later in infection. Mechanistically, PGLYRP1 enhances nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-1 signaling in response to TCT while suppressing NOD2- and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1)-mediated inflammatory pathways. TCT-bound PGLYRP1 selectively impairs TREM-1 activation compared to PGNs from other bacteria, revealing a novel bacterial immune evasion strategy.

We investigated whether IMO cultivation can propagate unique microbiomes and maintain microbial diversity through successive IMO stages for restoration of flood contaminated soils. Methods: We employed a balanced study design using soil samples from three New York metropolitan ecological sites: salt marsh, deciduous forest, and urban greenspace, plus sterilized controls. Samples underwent the first two IMO cultivation steps via inoculation on rice and fermentation in unrefined sugar. We extracted environmental DNA and performed 16S rRNA and ITS metagenomic sequencing using the AVITI platform and analyzed 84 libraries with QIIME2. Dynamics of microbial community composition and soil biodiversity, as a function of both ecological source and IMO cultivation, were assessed using Jaccard Index, Unweighted UniFrac, and ANCOM-BC analysis. Results: IMO cultivation was dominated by limited bacterial taxa (Enterobacterales, Pseudomonadales, Bacillales) and fungal taxa (Rhizopodaceae, particularly R. oryzae). While bacterial diversity was maintained or increased during two IMO stages, fungal diversity consistently decreased. Principal Coordinates Analysis revealed distinct clustering by inoculum source (i.e. manmade vs. natural vs. sterile) that persisted throughout cultivation. Conclusions: Our evidence suggests that the IMO process selects for specific taxa likely adapted to cultivated conditions and fails to maintain fungal diversity. This greatly contrasts IMO's proposed benefit of propagating locally-specific, fungal-dominated indigenous microbiomes. However, our results demonstrate that IMO cultures may capture and sustain bacterial diversity in soil, while it is unclear how such diversity may arise.

Because such infections are often secondary complications of other underlying pathologies, recurrent infections are common and can lead to multiple antibiotic exposures. This scenario creates steady selection pressure toward antibiotic resistance at the confluence of the skin (the largest mammalian organ), the bloodstream, and shared human and animal environments. This case study compares metagenomic (MGX) data with aerobic culture to evaluate diagnostic utility for simultaneous identification and characterization of pathogens, microbiomes, and resistomes of companion animal skin infections. Results: One feline and eight canine skin swabs were analyzed with aerobic culture and traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and compared with MGX profiling. Veterinary laboratory diagnostic (VDL) culture and AST identified Staphylococcus aureus, S. pseudintermedius, S. schleiferi, methicillin resistant (MR) S. schleiferi (MRSS), MR S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from skin swabs. MGX data described the identical bacterial pathogens recovered by aerobic culture and methicillin resistance genes mecA, mecI, mecR1 in samples for which AST confirmed MRSP and MRSS. MGX data also identified mec genes in samples without culture-based confirmation of MR phenotypes. MGX data also described multi-domain composition of microbiomes of infected skin including bacteria, fungi, viruses, phages, AMR, plasmids, and metabolic features associated with skin infections. Conclusions: MGX data identified the identical pathogens and inferred AMR phenotypes as culture-based diagnostic testing, and additionally characterizedo multi-domain microbiota, mobile AMR elements, and metabolic features. Efforts to accelerate cures by precision medical responses depend on accelerated precision diagnostics. Challenges remain for the implementation of MGX data into veterinary diagnostic laboratory investigation and response. We demonstrate with a small case study, that MGX data can be used to complement current state of the art VDL results and potentially advance a judicious veterinary medical response regarding antibiotic administration for companion animal skin infections. In the future, simultaneous description of the polymicrobial ecology of skin infections (bacterial, viruses, phages, fungi, and even functional metabolomic features) provided by MGX data can advance epidemiology, develop new treatment strategies, accelerate diagnostics and provide data for artificial intelligence (AI) models focused on advancing veterinary diagnostics and medical treatments.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

To enhance its biocontrol potential, we incorporated a free-living bacterial strain (S8) exhibiting biocontrol activity, forming a modified community (C8). We evaluated the biocontrol efficacy of S8, C7, and C8 against four major corn pathogens: Pythium torulosum, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium subglutinans, and Rhizoctonia solani. Plate assays revealed that S8 and C8 exhibited the highest inhibition against P. torulosum (>65% growth inhibition) but were less effective against Fusarium species (25 to 30%), while none of the communities restricted R solani growth. In pot assays under growth chamber conditions S8 alone exhibited superior pathogen suppression compared to C7 and C8. However, integrating S8 into C7 did not enhance overall biocontrol efficacy. Community analysis via 16S amplicon sequencing revealed no significant shifts in C7 community strain abundance upon S8 introduction, suggesting a lack of establishment of S8 into the C7 community. Given that some individual strains exhibited stronger pathogen suppression than C7 and had variable effects on root biomass and plant height, we designed three sub-communities (SC1, SC2, SC3) based on the highest inhibitory activity. Plant assays demonstrated that inoculation with SC1 and SC2 restored plant height and root biomass, indicating that biocontrol efficacy is primarily driven by specific strain combinations rather than the broader community.

Here, we show that even simple generative models like the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) can produce novel genetic circuits that match complex dynamic functions such as signal adaptation. Using in silico RNA simulation, we construct a dataset of RNA sequences and convert them to circuits via RNA interaction predictors, allowing us to estimate functional features alongside evolutionary stability and interpret model-learned features. Our model generates diverse distributions of circuits that match their target adaptation specification well, even when limited to small training data sets. Structures in the embedding space correspond to motifs previously identified as crucial for adaptation and reflect the design rules for adaptable circuits. Framing adaptation as a single design objective outperforms other input representations, reflecting the importance of choosing the correct data encoding for generating genetic circuits. Finally, we show that functional and evolutionary properties can be prompted simultaneously, providing a proof-of-concept for the combined design of phenotype and evotype.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "The IFN{gamma}-induced GTPase guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1) binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on cytosolic Gram-negative bacteria and promotes pyroptosis via the recruitment and activation of caspase-4 on the bacterial outer membrane. Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC, respectively) are extracellular pathogens that also induce LPS- and caspase-4-dependent pyroptosis. However, whether GBP1 is involved in this process remains unknown. EPEC and EHEC adhere intimately to intestinal epithelial cells via avid interactions between the bacterial adhesin Intimin and Tir (Translocated intimin receptor), a type 3 secretion system effector protein. Intimin-mediated clustering of Tir triggers actin polymerisation, leading to pedestal-like structures at bacterial attachment sites. Here we show that GBP1 is recruited to actin pedestals in human cells infected with EPEC and EHEC in vitro and mouse colonocytes infected with the EPEC-like murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium in vivo. GBP1-dependent caspase-4 trafficking to these sites leads to pyroptosis and IL-18 release. To dissect the mechanism of GBP1 trafficking, we engineered a chimeric receptor (Fc{gamma}R-Tir) by combining the intracellular signalling domain of Tir and the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the Fc{gamma} receptor. Clustering of Fc{gamma}R-Tir with IgG-coated beads produced \"sterile\" actin-rich pedestals that were sufficient to recruit GBP1 independently of bacteria. Our findings reveal that cytosolic GBP1 is mobilised to sites of pathogen-induced actin remodelling independently of LPS. We establish that GBP1 not only operates as a pattern-recognition receptor but also orchestrates effector-triggered immunity against pathogens that hijack the actin cytoskeleton.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we characterize a stable subgenomic dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) replicon (DENV2-rep) that supports long-term viral RNA replication in human hepatoma cells without triggering cytotoxicity or canonical stress responses. Compared to live DENV2 infection, which induces ER stress and global translation shutdown, DENV2-rep cells maintain active translation and polysome integrity, while mounting an antiviral transcriptional response and resisting superinfection. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling reveals that DENV2-rep cells accommodate long-term replication by remodeling of metabolic, secretory, and cytoskeletal pathways. In contrast, acute infection uncouples transcription from protein synthesis, limiting host proteome remodeling. We also detected marked depletion of the NS5 RNA polymerase in the DENV2-rep context. Together, these findings highlight host pathways that can be rewired to support persistent RNA replication and uncover post-translational regulation of viral proteins as a potential vulnerability. Our work clarifies the strengths and limitations of replicons as models for infection and reveals how persistent vRNA replication is tolerated through selective remodeling of translation, organelle composition, and protein stability.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

New primers and probes for multiplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) were developed to enable the discrimination between zebra and quagga mussels, whose veliger larvae are morphologically indistinguishable. Three eDNA sampling methods were compared: integrated water samples (0-50 m depth), sub-surface water samples, and plankton bulk samples. These methods were applied in four deep peri-alpine lakes and the results obtained with eDNA were compared to traditional veliger microscopic counts. The values obtained with the three eDNA approaches are positively corelated with visual counting of veliger larvae, but integrated water and plankton bulk eDNA samplings were found to be more effective in quantifying dreissenid veliger larvae and estimating reproductive periods than sub-surface water eDNA. The bulk-based approach is robust for qualitative presence/absence veliger larvae information, with a positive eDNA signal only when larvae are observed; it is the only eDNA method that successfully detected zebra signals in Lake Geneva. However, an overestimation of winter reproduction signal was observed for one lake with this method. The water-integrated approach captures well the quantitative dynamics of counted veliger larvae, but with the presence of false positives reproductive signal (mussel eDNA signal when no larvae are observed). The eDNA approaches tested here have enabled the characterisation of the reproductive dynamics of each of the two species in the studied lakes, highlighting the fact that quagga can reproduce throughout the year in peri-alpine lakes where it is dominant, whereas in lakes dominated by zebra, the reproduction period is limited to the warm season. The study also provides the first clue of quagga mussel presence in Lakes Annecy and Aiguebelette. Although further methodological refinements are suggested for the eDNA approaches evaluated in this study, those approaches are nonetheless already applicable and can contribute to a better understanding of these invasive species ecology in lakes.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

However, Earth's terrestrial surface is formed by a mosaic of different habitats, which constitutes a higher level of diversity known as landscape diversity. Recent studies indicate that landscape diversity can also promote ecosystem functions, including primary productivity, but the underlying mechanisms and relevant spatial scales remain poorly understood. Here, we combine satellite remote sensing of vegetation productivity with high-resolution land cover data to investigate the effects of landscape diversity on ecosystem functioning across different spatial scales. Using a plot network covering North America, we find that the observed landscape-wide effects cannot be explained by local-scale interactions along ecosystem interfaces. In a subsequent, global-scale analysis, we instead demonstrate that landscape diversity effects are most strongly associated to landscape diversity at a spatial scale of a few kilometers. This association holds across continents and climatic zones, indicating that this pattern is universal. Our investigation therefore suggests that effective land management and biodiversity conservation strategies must integrate both local species richness and higher-level organizational diversity, such as landscape diversity, to ensure robust ecosystem functioning.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

We found that hybrids are active and their offspring emerge earlier in spring, suggesting a competitive advantage over F. aquilonia. Hybrids also withstand acute temperatures relevant in nature better than F. aquilonia. Further, the hybrids' border has shifted 200 km northwards, coinciding with the expansion of climatic conditions suitable for hybrids. Our results provide compelling evidence that hybrids perform better under warming climates than their cold-adapted parent, and that recent climatic changes can lead to range expansion of hybrids.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Parasites and their communities are particularly vulnerable to stress due to environmental sensitivity of infection steps, variation in species tolerance during co-infections, and dependence on host fitness. Parasite populations might avoid extinction through evolutionary rescue - whereby rapid adaptation to stress enables persistence - but whether this process can preserve community diversity remains unclear. Here, we study the impact of evolutionary rescue in a simple parasite community by propagating populations of two viral parasites (bacteriophages {varphi}14-1 and {varphi}LUZ19) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in monoculture and co-culture under two thermal conditions, a control temperature (37{degrees}C) and a high temperature that restricts {varphi}14-1 growth (42{degrees}C). We show that evolutionary rescue of {varphi}14-1 prevented extinction in monoculture. Rescue of this phage in co-culture made it a superior competitor, and it replaced {varphi}LUZ19 as the dominant phage at high temperature. We determine that evolutionary rescue occurred through mutations in genes linked to attachment to bacterial hosts and within-host replication. We also show that competitive suppression by {varphi}14-1 constrained {varphi}LUZ19 molecular evolution. Our findings suggest that evolutionary rescue can prevent the extinction of some parasites, but may inadvertently destabilise the community and facilitate further biodiversity loss.

Retinal neurons, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), cornea, and lens each have distinct physiological roles and metabolic demands, yet the absolute concentrations of key TCA intermediates and their variation by tissue, sex, and time of day are not well-defined. Methods: Targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was employed to quantify the absolute concentrations of TCA cycle metabolites in mouse ocular tissues collected at 10 AM and 2 PM to capture diurnal variations. Key metabolite ratios were subsequently calculated to provide insight into TCA cycle dynamics across eye tissues. Results: The retina showed the highest concentrations of TCA metabolites among all ocular tissues, particularly succinate, citrate, and malate, consistent with its high energy demands. The RPE/choroid demonstrated well-balanced intermediates with the highest alpha-ketoglutarate/isocitrate ratio, reflecting its efficient mitochondrial oxidation and reductive carboxylation. Corneal metabolism was featured by dominant malate, especially in females, suggesting a metabolic adaptation for redox regulation and oxidative stress defense. The lens had uniformly low metabolite levels except for succinate, indicating minimal mitochondrial activity under physiologically low oxygen conditions. Notably, both the cornea and lens showed significant sex-dependent and diurnal variations in TCA cycle intermediates. Conclusion: This study demonstrates distinct tissue-specific mitochondrial metabolism in the eye, reflecting the unique functional and biochemical demands of each tissue.

We also observed a modest improvement in accuracy when MMPBSA is combined with replica exchange molecular dynamics, albeit at a significantly higher computational cost.

These loci are marked by extensive gene duplication, allelic diversity, and segmental duplications, features that contribute critically to the adaptive immune response. In this study, we present a comprehensive IMGT annotation of IGK and IGL using two high-quality human reference assemblies (GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13) along with 142 and 125 additional chromosomal-level haploid assemblies, respectively for each locus, from individuals representing all major human superpopulations. Detailed gene and allele annotation of the reference assemblies led to the identification of 5 novel IGKV genes and 8 new IGKV alleles, 16 new IGLV genes, and 22 novel IGLV alleles. These were confirmed through assembly read validation, presence in whole genome sequencing datasets, and recurrence in multiple assemblies. Gene-level identification across the broader dataset enabled assessment of structural variation (SV) at both loci. IGL displayed high conservation, with recurrent absence observed for only one gene. In contrast, IGK exhibited greater variability, including complete loss of the distal region in certain assemblies. This structural diversity was analyzed across superpopulations, allowing us to map potential patterns of gene presence and absence across different ancestral groups. All newly identified genes were consistently observed across individuals and genomic backgrounds.

Each quasi-equivalent interface exhibits a unique response: A sites, located within the pentameric capsomers, are unfilled in these systems and altered marginally by the presence of CAMs in neighboring interfaces. B sites are the most open and \"CAM-ready,\" suggesting uptake requires minimal conformational perturbation on the local or global level. C sites emerge as hubs of allosteric control and the key drug target, as their occupancy creates local distortion that is broadcast to adjacent sites, driving capsid faceting and - in the case of CAM-As - the destabilization that precedes dissociation in favor of aberrant assembly. D sites, unfilled in these systems, act as structural sinks, absorbing distortions from adjacent interfaces within the hexameric capsomers. The extent of C site adjustment and the nature of D site counterbalance varies with CAM chemotype, highlighting the divergent effects of CAM-As versus CAM-Es. The tensegrity relationship between the four quasi-equivalent interfaces couples them into a global network for strain redistribution that is functionally allosteric, with CAM binding sites displaying signs of both positive and negative cooperativity.

We found that PEG primarily exerts excluded-volume effects, maintaining RNA hydration and Na+ ion condensation similar to dilute conditions. In contrast, protein crowders significantly altered RNA electrostatics, reducing Na+ condensation by nearly 60%, displacing surface hydration water, and forming chemically specific contacts dominated by positively charged residues, notably arginine and lysine.

Newly developed human tonsil and spleen organoids, which replicate key features of B and T cell immunity and provide an exciting opportunity to overcome challenges of other models and to improve our understanding of innate-adaptive interactions in lymphoid tissue. The objectives of this study were to use these organoids to investigate the impact of malaria parasites on 1) cells within lymphoid tissues and 2) responses to a heterologous antigen. When we exposed organoids from malaria-naive donors to Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (iRBC), we observed that iRBC exposure did not disrupt organoid formation and significantly increased V{delta}2+ {gamma}{delta} T cell frequencies in both tonsil and spleen organoids at multiple timepoints. Single-cell RNA/TCR sequencing revealed that iRBC-responsive V{delta}2+ T cells in organoids were clonally expanded and exhibited activated, cytotoxic phenotypes with upregulated expression of granzymes, interferon-stimulated genes, and antigen presentation machinery. TCR repertoire analysis demonstrated that malaria exposure drove clonal expansion of cytotoxic V{delta}2+ T cells, contrasting with the diverse, smaller clones observed in control conditions. To validate these findings, we analyzed tonsils from Ugandan children with asymptomatic malaria infection and found expanded V{delta}2+ T cells with enhanced cytotoxic potential compared to uninfected controls. When we tested whether malaria pre-exposure affected subsequent recall responses to influenza vaccine, malaria pre-exposure or {gamma}{delta} T cell depletion did not significantly alter cellular frequencies or influenza-specific antibody responses in most donors, though modest reductions were observed in some individuals.

M.; Britton, B.; Zaefferer, S.; Gault, B.", "abstract": "The study of biological and organic materials at high resolution using cryogenic transmission-electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) necessitates vitrification to preserve the native structure. Assessing sample integrity is essential, particularly as ice crystallization during freezing and handling can cause irrecoverable structural damage. Usually, a secondary cryo-TEM is used for initial screening, only possible after a time-consuming sample preparation workflow. In the present work, we propose simple methods that exploit existing workflows developed for materials science analyses and demonstrate on-grid in situ assessment of ice crystallinity with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) on a direct electron detector (DED) in a cryo-scanning-electron microscope (SEM). This evaluation step can be performed prior to sample preparation for cryo-TEM by using cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling. Custom grid holders and jigs were developed to integrate the clipped cryo-TEM grids and evolve the sample preparation workflow. EBSD detects hexagonal ice in some areas of the samples, whereas other areas show an absence of EBSD signal, consistent with vitreous ice, that enable targeting the further steps of sample preparation for cryo-TEM. Off-axis transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) was attempted, but led to severe damage to polished TEM-lamellae and appears unsuitable. A proof-of-concept lift-out from a clipped cryo-TEM grid mounted on a support is introduced, demonstrating possibilities for expanded cryogenic correlative workflows beyond the acceleration of sample screening for cryo-TEM.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Modelling the selective pressures at play in a natural population requires a thorough understanding of species structure and demographic history, which can be helpful in hypothesizing the genetic and evolutionary factors that underlie divergence. In this study, we assess whole genome sequences of round-tailed horned lizards (Phyrnosoma modestum) from throughout the species range and combine phylogenetic analyses with genetic landscape scans to understand how current genetic diversity has been influenced by demographic histories and evolutionary pressures. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis supports two lineages within the species, correlating with a North/South population divide that likely diverged about 7 Ma and displayed little migration. Intermediate gdi values indicate that the two lineages may be in the gray area of speciation, yet our results also support significant isolation-by-distance (IBD). Negative values of Tajimas D offer support for selection acting on P. modestum, but may stem from recent population expansions. Genomic diversity within populations and islands of divergence between populations are also detected across the P. modestum genome, specifically exhibiting differentiation patterns linked to reproductive isolation and within-population selection. We posit potential explanations for the genomic landscape characterized here, namely that allopatry plays a large role in shaping genomic divergence across the species range. Taken together, our results provide a picture of a species currently maintaining species integrity despite significant genomic signatures of geographic structure and reproductive isolation.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

U.", "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is marked by profound spatial heterogeneity. This complexity fuels tumor progression and therapy resistance. Although recent spatial transcriptomics (ST) studies have defined transcriptional niches, or metaprograms, the systems level regulatory logic linking upstream signaling, transcriptional programs, and therapeutic vulnerabilities remains unresolved. Here, we introduce an integrated, multi layered framework that unifies transcription factor and pathway activity inference (STAN and SPAN) with ligand/receptor and drug target mapping, thereby constructing a systems-level regulatory atlas of GBM across 26 tumors. This atlas uncovers spatial niches organized around transcriptional hubs and signaling programs, including hypoxic mesenchymal regions coordinated by HIF1A and SOX2 with mTORC1 signaling, macrophage rich areas driven by STAT3 mediated immune modulation, and astrocyte-like states shaped by lipid metabolic regulators such as SREBF2. By coupling this regulatory atlas to drug target predictions, we identify niche specific therapeutic vulnerabilities, such as VEGF blockade in HIF1A high regions and MAO-B inhibition in mesenchymal states. Finally, we provide an open, interactive web resource to make these data broadly accessible. This work provides a generalizable blueprint for linking spatial regulation to therapeutic hypotheses across diverse human diseases.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Two disposable piezoelectric injectors are positioned in tandem along the tape to produce a queue of nanoliter-scale droplets. X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses arrive perpendicular to and passes through the broad face of the tape where the pulse is synchronized and aligned to the droplets and thereby enables very highly efficient SFX data collection. The tape transport speed and the delivery distance can be varied to control the mixing time from approximately 130 ms to tens of seconds. We conducted time-resolved SFX experiments utilizing a basic enzymatic reaction model of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) to demonstrate the drop-on-drop capabilities of CoT, and the full binding process of GlcNAc to HEWL was observed at 1.3-9.7 s.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

G.; Liu, G.", "abstract": "Investment in sexual reproduction has long been seen as a fitness cost for asexual proliferation, raising the question of how cells evolve to accommodate cyclical demands of sexual and asexual cycles. We addressed this question by evolving Schizosaccharomyces pombe lacking the critical fusion gene Prm1 through 18 cycles of alternating meiosis and mitosis. Initially, transcriptional tweaks offered a fragile means to fuse despite Prm1's absence. However, a telomeric 1% genome deletion that epigenetically silenced Clr5 ultimately locked in a latent, Prm1 independent fusion pathway involving the mating regulator Ste11 and the pheromone MAPK scaffold Sms1. This adaptation, though efficient at restoring sexual reproduction, came at the cost of mitotic growth. By contrast, rationally constructing mutations in a synthetic evolution approach bypassed the trade off, enabling simultaneous high fusion efficiency and near wild type proliferation. Our findings illustrate how epigenetic derepression and genetic assimilation converge to create innovative solutions under cyclical selection pressures with trade offs.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

M.; Steiner, U. K.", "abstract": "Microbial population growth arises from the survival and division of individual cells. However, under environmental stress, how reduced population fitness emerges from the single-cell dynamics remains poorly understood. Cellular aging and damage accumulation are often overlooked in linking these levels. Here, we use both theory and experiment to investigate how stochastic and asymmetric damage dynamics shape population outcomes. Theoretically, we apply a jump-diffusion damage model within a structured population framework to explore the roles of damage rate, noise, and partitioning asymmetry. Our theoretical analyses show that these parameters influence population growth both at equilibrium and during transient dynamics, suggesting that their cellular regulation may be a key strategy for sustaining population fitness. Experimentally, we expose Escherichia coli to glucose limitation and monitor stress responses using a RpoS fluorescent reporter, tracking both single-cell behavior in a microfluidic device combined with time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and population growth in a plate reader. Glucose limitation leads to the effects of elevated stress, reduced division, and increased mortality, which are consistently observed across scales. Using parameter estimates from single-cell data, our model deepens insights on population-level dynamics and highlights damage-noise driven, damage-dependent mortality as a key factor under stress. Together, these findings establish a quantitative framework linking intracellular stress to population fitness under environmental stress.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "The abundant resources provided by the host provide an evolutionary rationale for parasitism and drive the metabolic and developmental divergence of parasitic and free-living animals. Two evolutionally distant nematode genera, Steinernema and Heterorhabditis, independently evolved an entomopathogenic lifestyle, in which they invade insects and kill them with the assistance of specifically associated symbiotic pathogenic bacteria. It had been generally assumed that the worm, being a bacterivore, feeds on its symbiotic bacteria, which rapidly reproduce while consuming the insect host. The evolutionary adaptations of entomopathogenic nematodes to a parasitic lifestyle developmentally, and the symbiotic relationships of entomopathogenicity, remain largely unknown. We developed an axenic culture medium that allows for robust and sustained growth of Steinernema hermaphroditum, allowing finite control of nutrients available to the nematodes. We found that, uniquely among nematodes tested, the hatchlings of S. hermaphroditum cannot endure in a nutrient-poor environment; this ability is impaired but still present in Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. Similarly, the ability to forage for food is completely lost in H. bacteriophora hatchlings and severely compromised in S. hermaphroditum. We reasoned that these traits were lost because they are unnecessary to obligate parasites that always hatch in a resource-rich host. We further found that Steinernema and, to a limited extent, Heterorhabditis nematodes can successfully invade, develop, and reproduce inside a living insect host independent of their symbiotic bacteria, apparently feeding on the hemolymph, and emerge carrying bacteria found within, explaining the evolutionary origins of entomopathogenic nematodes.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

However, due to the challenges of differentiating goat remains from that of sheep using traditional archaeozoological approaches, there are few specimens specifically identified as goat. To address this we employed genetic, proteomics, and archaeozoological techniques to assess faunal remains from the Late Bronze assemblage of Haughey's Fort (Armagh) and medieval assemblage of Carrickfergus (Antrim). We identify these specimens as goats using proteomics and genetics, and additionally determine their molecular sex. Genomic data recovered from a Haughey's Fort goat reveals a three-millenia genetic connection between herds in the Late Bronze Age, medieval period, and the indigenous Irish breed extant today, the Old Irish Goat. We additionally find varying levels of inbreeding within goats from the settlement of Carrickfergus, suggesting possible mixed use of herds within medieval Irish society. Our results demonstrate the continuing potential of combining archaeological and biomolecular techniques to clarify existing ambiguities and at the same time reveal new facets of the past.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

We present a machine learning approach for predicting TLR4 binding affinity using comprehensive molecular descriptors. Our ensemble learning pipeline extracted 53 physicochemical features from a curated dataset of 49 unique TLR4 ligands, achieving cross-validation R^2 of 0.74(+/-)0.10 with statistical significance confirmed by permutation testing (p < 0.01). The most predictive features were Bertz complexity (importance: 0.173), molecular shape descriptors (0.159), and molar refractivity (0.145), while traditional drug-like properties such as LogP showed lower importance (0.056). This suggests TLR4 binding follows distinct structure-activity patterns compared to conventional drug targets. Compounds with intermediate structural complexity (Bertz complexity: 400-600) demonstrated optimal binding affinity. The model successfully identified key molecular scaffolds, including flavonoids and terpenoids, aligning with known natural product TLR4 modulators. This work provides the first comprehensive machine learning analysis of TLR4 binding determinants and offers a computational framework for rational design of TLR4-targeted therapeutics, with identified molecular features providing actionable insights for developing next-generation immunomodulatory drugs.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Carnosine dipeptidase II (CNDP2) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that hydrolyzes Cys-Gly and plays an important role in maintaining intracellular cysteine (Cys) homeostasis. CNDP2-mediated hydrolysis of Cys-Gly promotes Cys mobilization and contributes to the replenishment of intracellular GSH levels. CNDP2 is frequently overexpressed in various cancers and has been implicated in tumor cell proliferation and progression. This mechanism may enhance cancer cell survival by causing resistance to oxidative stress, which indicates that CNDP2 is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Although bestatin (BES) has been identified as a CNDP2 inhibitor, its limited specificity and suboptimal drug-like properties have limited its therapeutic potential. In this study, we performed an in silico screen of a small-molecule compound library and identified KKL-35 as a novel CNDP2-binding molecule. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that KKL-35 interacts within the catalytic pocket. Biochemical assays confirmed that it inhibits CNDP2 enzymatic activity, albeit with lower potency compared with BES. Despite its modest intrinsic activity, KKL-35 exhibits favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, which are characterized by a low topological polar surface area (TPSA), reduced molecular flexibility, and well-balanced lipophilicity. This positions it as an attractive and tractable starting point for lead optimization. Taken together, these findings establish KKL-35 as a validated CNDP2 inhibitor and a promising lead compound for the development of more selective therapeutics targeting CNDP2-mediated cancer cell metabolism.", "date": "2025-09-27", "journal": ""}

Our final model was trained exclusively on deep mutational scanning data. We compare our model with five established solubility prediction methods. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on an independent dataset of various proteins, especially in predicting the effects of multipoint mutations (informedness of 26.5 %). Our findings also reaffirm that the scarcity of solubility data continues to hamper progress in this field. To address this limitation, we experimentally quantified solubility changes for hundreds of single-point and multipoint mutants of haloalkane dehalogenase.
