This has been taken as support for the Motor-Cognitive model of motor imagery and in opposition to the theory of Functional Equivalence. Here, we examined another prediction of the MCM, namely that an opposite pattern of effects would be observed when the information available for online control was reduced, with physical actions being affected but motor imagery being largely resistant. This was tested in four experiments in which participants performed either physical actions or motor imagery, and in a replication in which they performed both. The experiments manipulated the quality of information available during the online control of movement through: 1) comparing movements made with or without visual feedback (Exp 1 and 1a); 2) comparing movements made using foveal vs. peripheral vision (Exp 2); and 3) comparing physical to mimed actions (Exp 3). All four experiments found evidence in favour of the Motor-Cognitive model in that manipulations of online control affected physical action much more than they affected motor imagery. These results were, however, inconsistent with a Functional Equivalence view. We discuss these results in the broader context of other theoretical views of motor imagery.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Here we focus on Ewing sarcoma, a FET fusion oncoprotein (EWSR1-FLI1) driven pediatric bone tumor, as a model for the class of FET rearranged cancers. Native FET family members are among the earliest factors recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), though the function of both native FET proteins and FET fusion oncoproteins in DNA repair remains to be defined. We discover that EWSR1-FLI1 and other FET fusion oncoproteins are recruited to DNA DSBs and impair the activation and downstream signaling of the DNA damage sensor ATM. In multiple FET rearranged cancers, we establish the compensatory ATR signaling axis as a collateral dependency and therapeutic target using patient-derived xenograft models.

To investigate the electrophysiological mechanisms of the AIC during reward expectancy, we collected intracranial electroencephalographic data from epilepsy patients undergoing clinical monitoring. Subjects navigated a virtual T-maze containing rewards at three predetermined locations. We focused on the period immediately before entering the reward zone, termed the reward expectancy stage. During this stage, we identified the reward-specific brain patterns (RBPs) that were preactivated in the AIC. This pre-activation preceded the emergence of robust phase amplitude coupling (PAC), where theta oscillations (5~7 Hz) modulated gamma activities (75~110 Hz). The PAC strength correlated positively with the pre-activation level of RBPs, implying the potential role of oscillatory coordination in amplifying preactivated reward representations. Strikingly, this PAC effect exhibited a specific temporal structure that peak gamma activity became progressively coupled to earlier theta phases as reward approached, mirroring the the theta phase precession phenomenon previously observed in frontal and temporal lobes. We refer to this dynamic as phase-precession-like effect (PPLE). Moreover, subjects exhibiting PPLE in the AIC presented greater trial-by-trial improvements in response latency. Taken together, these findings shed light on the electrophysiological mechanisms of the AIC underlying reward expectancy.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Matrix components can be produced by the microorganisms themselves but can also originate from the environment and then be incorporated into the biofilm. For example, we and our collaborators have recently shown that collagen, a host-produced protein that is abundant in many different infection sites, can be taken up into the matrices of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, altering biofilm mechanics. In an infection, the biofilm matrix protects bacteria from clearance by the immune system, and some of that protection likely arises from the mechanical properties of the biofilm. P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Burkholderia pseudomallei are human pathogens notable for forming biofilms in vitro and in vivo in tissues rich in collagen such as lung and skin. Here, we show that the incorporation of Type I collagen into P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and B. pseudomallei biofilms significantly enhances biofilm elasticity and hinders phagocytosis of biofilm bacteria by human neutrophils. Additionally, enzymatic degradation of collagen using collagenase reverses these effects, increasing biofilm susceptibility to neutrophils.

However, individuals within populations can differ greatly in their plasticity towards perceived risk, especially when antipredator responses incur fitness costs via lost foraging opportunities. Therefore, risk-benefit trade-offs are usually made at the individual level. We test whether red deer (Cervus elaphus) inhabiting the Bavarian Forest National Park show individual variation in behavioral plasticity towards human disturbance. We measured human disturbance as the number of recreationists on the closest trail on a given day and used random regression to dissolve movement responses, measured as hourly step-length, of 63 GPS-collared red deer females to fine scale spatio-temporal variation in disturbance. We quantified behavioral state specific between-individual variation along the disturbance gradient. At the population level, red deer responded to recreational disturbance during the middle of the day only, and reduced movement in response to recreation. However, population patterns masked strong between-individual variation in plasticity to recreation activity during the morning, midday, and evening, such that some deer reacted with flight while others responded little. Behavioral responses were mediated by vegetation cover with stronger responses in more open areas. Flight responses are costly due to lost foraging opportunities. A shift in risk-benefit trade-offs when risk is non-lethal, as is the case for recreation in many national parks, may favor more human-tolerant individuals over time.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Auxin is crucial for plant morphogenesis, including in vivo and in vitro embryo development. Exogenous auxin application is necessary for inducing embryogenic responses in in vitro cultured explants of Arabidopsis and other plants. Thus, components of auxin transport, signaling, and metabolism are key to somatic embryogenesis. AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors bind to auxin response elements to control auxin-responsive gene expression and are vital in somatic embryo regeneration. ARFs are often repressed by AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACIDs (Aux/IAAs). MONOPTEROS (MP)/ARF5 is especially important in the embryogenic transition, being highly expressed during somatic embryogenesis; its mutant cannot develop somatic embryos. The MP11ir transcript, an alternatively spliced variant of MP, produces a truncated protein missing the Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain, crucial for ARF-Aux/IAA dimerization. This renders the MP11ir isoform insensitive to Aux/IAA repression, suggesting an auxin-independent regulation. High levels of MP11ir transcript are observed during auxin- and trichostatin A-dependent induction of somatic embryogenesis. Both MP and MP11ir are essential for embryo regeneration in the mpS319 mutant. However, overexpression of a truncated MP protein ({Delta}ARF5) lacking the PB1 domain inhibits somatic embryogenesis, resulting in callus formation instead of somatic embryos. Overexpression of {Delta}ARF5, lack of MP protein (mp mutant), and interference with MP action by the auxin-resistant BODENLOS (BDL) protein affect the expression of the genes TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA1), TAA1-RELATED 1 (TAR1), YUCCA3 (YUC3), YUC5 and YUC8, which are involved in auxin biosynthesis. The partial complementation of mpS319 by the expression of MP11ir may be due to the restoration of the expression of TAA1, TAR1, YUC3, YUC5, and YUC8 to the levels observed in the wild-type genotype Col-0. The presence of MP protein alone or in combination with MP11ir in mpS319 restored the expression of all analyzed genes compared to Col-0. Our results suggest that the analyzed auxin-related genes could be potential targets of MP11ir and/or MP. Consequently, {Delta}ARF5 overexpression alters auxin homeostasis and endogenous auxin levels, hindering embryogenic transition.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Here we show that the behavioral switch between foraging and reproduction is associated with changes in antennal sensitivity. Starved flies became more sensitive to food odors while suppressing their response to opposite-sex pheromones. The gene encoding sulfakinin receptor 1 (SkR1) was significantly upregulated in the antennae of starved flies, so we tested the behavioral phenotypes of null mutants for the genes encoding the receptor (SkR1-/-) and its ligand sulfakinin (Sk-/-). In both knockout lines, the antennal responses shifted to mating mode even when flies were starved. This suggests that sulfakinin signaling via SkR1 promotes foraging while suppressing mating. Further analysis of the mutant flies revealed that sets of odorant receptor (OR) genes were differentially expressed. Functional characterization of the differentially expressed ORs suggested that sulfakinin directly suppresses the expression of ORs that respond to opposite-sex hormones while enhancing the expression of ORs that detect food volatiles. We conclude that sulfakinin signaling via SkR1, modulating OR expressions and leading to altered antenna sensitivities, is an important component in starvation-dependent behavioral change.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

LO and VO contained opposing representations of an encountered reward's subjective benefit and its associated opportunity costs, respectively. The relative balance of these representations tracked decisions to approach or leave a reward during each stage of an encounter. Opposing representations of subjective benefit in LO and opportunity costs in VO were realized by distinct clusters of cells within each subregion across stages of a reward encounter (i.e., task state). In addition, overall activity in each subregion scaled with changes in the subjective value of rewards induced by external, economic conditions (reward scarcity) and internal, motivational factors (hunger).

The concentration of {beta}-alanine is decreased in Salmonella-infected macrophages, while the addition of exogenous {beta}-alanine enhances Salmonella replication in macrophages, suggesting that Salmonella can uptake host-derived {beta}-alanine for intracellular growth. Moreover, the expression of panD, the rate-limiting gene required for {beta}-alanine synthesis in Salmonella, is upregulated when Salmonella enters macrophages. Mutation of panD impaired Salmonella replication in macrophages and colonization in the mouse liver and spleen, indicating that de novo synthesis of {beta}-alanine is essential for intracellular Salmonella growth and systemic infection.

Curcumin, a natural plant-derived compound, has been shown to have anticancer effects and neuroprotective properties via its influence on epigenetic regulation. However, the precise nature of these epigenetic changes and the mechanisms driving them remain largely unexplored. Moreover, there is strong evidence linking the neuroactive properties of chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of breast cancer to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Therefore, studying epigenetic regulation of neuroactive compounds in breast cancer is significant in also understanding their mechanisms mediating neuropathy in breast cancer. This study aims to apply a 3D network model to profile the histone codes modified by curcumin as a neuroactive compound and to hypothesize the enzymatic pathways driving these modifications in breast cancer. Using multi-omic data from the NIH LINCS program, we identified two novel histone codes associated with curcumin, mediated through 23 phosphoproteins involved in cell signaling. These signatures were linked to genes expressed in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which are characterized in this study. Together, the histone and phosphoprotein profiles represent potential biomarkers for the development of chromatin-targeted therapies in breast cancer, as well as new strategies for managing neuropathy in breast cancer patients.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Acute endurance exercise appears to transiently perturb AS in skeletal muscle, but transcriptome-wide responses are not well-defined. We aimed to better understand differential AS (DAS) and differential isoform expression (DIE) in skeletal muscle by comparing short-read (SRS) and long-read RNA sequencing (LRS) data. Methods: Publicly accessible SRS of clinical exercise studies were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Oxford Nanopore LRS was performed on mouse gastrocnemius before and following treadmill exercise (30m running, n=5 mice/group, 20 total, 10 weeks old). Differential gene expression (DGE) and DIE were analyzed and validated using RT-PCR and immunoblots. Results: Both SRS and LRS illustrated significant DGE in skeletal muscle post-exercise, including 89 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). rMATS analysis of SRS revealed that exon-skipping and intron-retaining events were the most common. Swan analysis of LRS revealed several common genes across post-exercise cohorts with significant DAS but no DGE: 13 exercise-associated genes, including mSirt2 (24.5% shift at 24hr post-exercise [24pe], p=0.005); 61 RBPs, including mHnrnpa3 (28.5% at 24pe, p=0.02), mHnrnpa1 (30.6% at 24pe, p=0.004), and mTia1 (53.6% at 24pe, p=0.004). Conclusions: We illustrated that acute endurance exercise can elicit changes in AS-related responses and RBP expression in skeletal muscle, especially at 24pe. SRS is a powerful tool for analyzing DGE but lacks isoform detection, posing a major gap in knowledge of hidden genes with no transcriptional but significant DIE and protein expression changes. Additionally, LRS can uncover previously unknown transcript diversity and mechanisms influencing endurance exercise adaptations and responses.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Since the discovery of USVs in rats, it has gradually been revealed that two types of adult rats' USVs with distinct acoustic features (high-short and low-long) are closely linked to positive and negative affect, respectively. Thus, for many years, most studies have grouped USVs into dichotomous categories: 50-kHz (positive) USVs and 22-kHz (negative) USVs, using these numbers as labels rather than measured values. However, the diversity of rats' USVs may have been overlooked due to this 50- / 22-kHz dichotomous framework, as several recent studies claim to have found new categories in USVs outside the framework. Here, through a systematic survey of descriptions of rats' USVs in the past literature, we confirmed a non-negligible number of reports on USVs that are outside the dichotomous framework. Our results support the abundance of diverse USVs beyond the dichotomy. This extends the traditional association between acoustic features and emotional states, highlighting the importance of research on diverse vocalizations that might reflect complex affective states beyond the simple distinction between positive and negative.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

The ability of populations to evolve and adapt to environmental changes depends on rates of mutational diversification and the distribution of fitness effects of random mutations. In turn, the distribution of fitness effects of stochastic mutations can be expected to depend on the adaptive state of a population. To systematically study the impact of the interplay between the adaptive state of a population on the ability of asexual populations to adapt, we used a spatial agent-based model of a neoplastic population adapting to a selection pressure of continuous exposure to targeted therapy. We found favorable mutations were overrepresented at the extinction bottleneck but depleted at the adaptive peak. The model-based predictions were tested using an experimental cancer model of an evolution of resistance to a targeted therapy. Consistent with the model predictions, we found that enhancement of the mutation rate was highly beneficial under therapy but moderately detrimental under the baseline conditions. Our results highlight the importance of considering population fitness in evaluating the fitness distribution of random mutations and support the potential therapeutic utility of restricting mutational variability.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

The regular positioning and segregation of mtDNA-containing nucleoids is essential for mitochondrial function and inheritance, as well as cellular health. However, the underlying mechanism driving nucleoid distribution and disaggregation remains unknown. Our data reveal that mitochondria frequently undergo reversible pearling, a biophysical instability that undulates tubules into regularly spaced beads, typically triggered by calcium influx. We discovered that physiological pearling imposes a characteristic length scale, simultaneously mediating nucleoid disaggregation and establishing inter-nucleoid distancing with near-maximally achievable precision. We found that lamellar cristae invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane play a dual role, determining pearling frequency and duration, and preserving the resulting nucleoid spacing after organelle recovery to a tubular form. Thus, disrupting cristae ultrastructure resulted in more frequent pearling, but also aberrant nucleoid clustering. Our results demonstrate that the distribution of mitochondrial genomes is governed by the interplay between rapid and reversible pearling and cristae ultrastructure, establishing a mechanism for this long-puzzling yet fundamental feature of eukaryotic life, and offering insights into its potential modulation.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

However, non-metabolic factors, such as motivational and emotional states, can also influence peripheral sensory processing and hence feeding behavior. While mating experience is known to induce motivational and emotional changes, its broader impact on other innate behaviors such as feeding remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we demonstrated that mating failure of male fruit flies suppressed sweet taste perception via dopamine signaling in specific neural circuitry. Upon repetitive failure in courtship, male flies exhibited a sustained yet reversible decline of sweet taste perception, as measured by the proboscis extension reflex (PER) towards sweet tastants as well as the neuronal activity of sweet-sensing Gr5a+ neurons in the proboscis. Mechanistically, we identified a small group of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) and innervating with Gr5a+ neurons as the key modulator. Repetitive sexual failure decreased the activity of these dopaminergic neurons and in turn suppressed Gr5a+ neurons via Dop1R1 and Dop2R receptors. Our findings revealed a critical role for dopaminergic signaling in integrating reproductive experience with appetitive sensory processing, providing new insights into the complex interactions between different innate behaviors and the role of brain's reward systems in regulating internal motivational and emotional states.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

This study aims to elucidate the relationship between gut microbiota rhythmicity and the development of sleep patterns in infants over the first year of life. We continuously monitored 162 healthy infants across multiple days at 3, 6, and 12 months of age using ankle actigraphy and 24-hour diaries. The Circadian Function Index (CFI) was computed as a proxy for sleep-wake rhythm maturation. Stool samples were collected to profile gut microbiota taxa composition via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and microbial oscillations were assessed through sine and cosine fitting to detect 24-hour patterns. Results: Our findings revealed that the relative abundance of bacterial taxa exhibited rhythmic patterns, with 26 zOTUs (1.74%) following a sine pattern and 100 zOTUs (6.69%) displaying cosine rhythmicity. Cosine rhythmicity became more pronounced with age, showing strong maturation: 7 zOTUs at 3 months, 2 zOTUs at 6 months, and 86 zOTUs at 12 months. Notably, 105 zOTUs (7.02%) were associated with CFI, demonstrating a significant relationship between gut microbiota rhythms and sleep development. Among these, 27 zOTUs with sine dynamics and 96 zOTUs with cosine dynamics were linked to CFI, with this association strengthening as infants aged. Conclusions: These results highlight the increasing synchronization between gut microbiota rhythmicity and sleep-wake cycles during infancy, pointing to a critical window for potential health interventions. This novel observation, previously reported in rodents and adults, underscores the role of gut microbiota in early human development, offering new avenues for enhancing developmental outcomes through targeted interventions.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Unlike characterized peptide-modifying FDHs, which are limited to either specifically modified peptides or the termini of linear peptides, ChlH halogenates internal Trp residues of linear peptides, as well as N- and C-terminal Trp. Scanning mutagenesis of the substrate peptide ChlA revealed Trp was tolerated by ChlH at nearly every position. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborated the importance of a C-terminal motif in ChlA and provided insight into the lack of Trp14 chlorination in native chlorolassin. Furthermore, halogenation of disparate ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) precursor peptides, pharmacologically relevant peptides, and an internal Trp of a protein was achieved using wild-type ChlH. A rapid cell-free biosynthetic assay provided insight into ChlH's preferences.

We thus directly compared co-housing, fecal transplantation, and cecal transplantation methods. Donor mice from Taconic Biosciences, possessing distinct microbial communities, served as the microbial source for recipient mice from Jackson Laboratories, which were treated with antibiotics to disrupt their native microbiota. We monitored bacterial and viral populations longitudinally over the course of antibiotics treatment and reconstitution using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, quantitative PCR, and shotgun sequencing of viral-like particles. As expected, antibiotic treatment rapidly depleted microbial biomass and diversity, with slow and incomplete natural recovery of the microbiota in non-transplanted control mice.

Myristica argentea is a spice tree species used by local populations since centuries/millennia. The species has been introduced in other locations from the region. Fourteen microsatellite markers (nSSRs), whole chloroplast (cp) genome, and nuclear-targeted sequence genes (nrDNA sequence) were used to characterize the genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history of the species across its distribution range (native and introduced populations). We found that native populations of the species in Fakfak present higher levels of genetic diversity than introduced populations. We further detected the presence of a moderate genetic structure (FST = 0.143), and the presence of three intraspecific genetic clusters. Additionally, our findings indicate that population fragmentation within the native range of the species in Fakfak, may have been influenced by the presence of riparian networks, mountain ranges and by Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Our results suggest that all introduced populations were sourced mainly from the native population of Raduria, in the South of Fakfak region. Given the population genetic variation across the ranges of Papuan nutmeg, management plans should not treat them as single populations, but rather consider the broader genetic diversity within its range.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Importantly, genomic surveillance of malaria vectors can provide critical, policy-relevant insights into the presence and evolution of insecticide resistance, allowing us to maintain and extend the shelf-life of these interventions. Yet the complex genetic architecture of resistance, combined with resource constraints in malaria-endemic settings have thus far precluded the widespread use of genomics in routine surveillance. Meanwhile, stakeholders in sub-Saharan Africa are moving towards locally driven, decentralised generation of genomic data, underscoring the need for standardised and robust workflows for genomics. To address this need, we demonstrate an approach to targeted genomic surveillance in Anopheles gambiae s.l with Illumina sequencing. We target 90 genomic loci in the Anopheles gambiae s.l genome, including 55 resistance-associated mutations and 35 ancestry informative markers. This protocol is coupled with advanced, automated software for accurate and reproducible variant analysis. We are able to elucidate population structure and ancestry in our cohorts and accurately identify most species in the An. gambiae species complex. We report frequencies of variants at insecticide-resistance loci and explore the continued evolution of the pyrethroid target site, the Voltage-gated sodium channel. Applying the platform to a recently established colony of field-caught resistant mosquitoes (Siaya, Kenya), we identified seven independent resistance-associated variants contributing to reduced efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in East Africa. Additionally, we leverage a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to demonstrate the possibility of predicting bioassay mortality using genotypes alone. This achieved very high accuracy (75%), demonstrating the potential of targeted genomics to predictively monitor insecticide resistance.

We show that fascin is enriched in the motile filopodia of axonal growth cones and its inhibition impairs axonal extension and branching of hippocampal neurons in culture. We next provide evidence that fascin is essential for axon development and brain wiring in vivo using Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Drosophila expresses a single ortholog of mammalian fascin called Singed (SN), which is highly expressed in the mushroom body (MB) of the central nervous system.

To address this gap, we conducted an extensive literature review and developed DateBack (https://cloudapps.france-bioinformatique.fr/dateback), a digital open-access repository of archaeobotanical remains of Phoenix (L.) spp. In its first version, DateBack records macroremains (e.g., seeds, fruits, stems, petioles) from prehistoric to Late Antiquity contexts in Southwest and South Asia. We assembled 154 entries from 110 archaeological sites across 123 references, along with a separate table of 74 radiocarbon-dated entries from 20 sites, refining chronological assessments. Most entries comprise charred seeds (58.4%), with a smaller proportion of charred vegetative parts or desiccated remains. Our findings highlight regional disparities in the distribution of remains, with concentration in the Levant and the Gulf region, while Saudi Arabia and southern Iran are underrepresented. There are also disparities in data reliability, particularly in dating resolution, which complicate the reconstruction of date cultivation history. Our evidence shows that the earliest securely dated remains, indicating date consumption, appear in the Gulf region around 5000 BCE, while cultivation emerges later, first in southern Mesopotamia and the northern Gulf in the 4th millennium BCE, then in eastern Arabia and the Indus Valley in the 3rd millennium BCE. The Levant presents challenges, with numerous presumed early finds but significant uncertainties, with secure evidence of cultivation only appearing by the late 2nd millennium BCE, as in northwestern Arabia, while in the southern Arabian Peninsula, it is not attested until the 1st millennium BCE. By compiling and standardizing archaeobotanical data, DateBack facilitates advanced spatiotemporal analyses of date palm history and supports additional archaeobotany-based research including ancient DNA studies.

PAC deletion enhanced phagosomal acidification and protease activities, leading to augmented bacterial killing in large peritoneal macrophages (LPMs) upon Escherichia coli infection in mice. Surprisingly, phagosome degradation also stimulated STING-IRF3-interferon responses and inflammasome activation in LPMs, both of which are enhanced upon PAC deletion. The increased inflammasome activation induced the release of cleaved gasdermin D, which localized to the surface of bacteria in the peritoneum and further contributed to their killing. Finally, enhanced bacterial clearance by PAC-deficient LPMs reduced proinflammatory immune cell infiltration and peritoneal inflammation, resulting in improved survival in mice. Our study thus provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of phagosome maturation and the dynamics of host defense response following phagosome-mediated bacterial degradation in peritoneal macrophages.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

The Zika virus (ZIKV) is known for its pronounced neurotropism, with recent infectious clusters raising renewed public health concerns. While research has predominantly focused on congenital populations, growing evidence suggests that the mature central nervous system (CNS) is also vulnerable. However, no study has examined the long-term impact of ZIKV infection on the adult human brain. To address this gap, we studied a rare group of adult ZIKV patients presenting with both peripheral (Guillain-Barre Syndrome; GBS) and CNS-related neurological symptoms. We compared these patients at the chronic stage (5 to 12 months post-infection) to healthy controls and to patients with GBS of non-ZIKV etiology (total N=43). Structural and functional measures included cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensities, diffusion metrics, and resting-state functional connectivity. Despite the rarity of both patient populations, power analyses indicated that our sample size could detect large group differences--effect sizes deemed reasonable given the severity of neurological symptoms in the ZIKV group. Nonetheless, our multimodal analyses yielded null results, with Bayesian statistics (where applicable) providing evidence for a lack of effects. The null findings suggest that chronic ZIKV infection in adults is not associated with brain changes of large magnitude.

ClpB is a quality control machine of the AAA+ family that salvages misfolded and aggregated proteins by forcibly translocating them through its lumen. Structural studies of this and similar machines have suggested a power-stroke translocation mechanism directly coupled to sequential subunit motion. However, functional studies have challenged this deterministic view. Here, we directly track substrate translocation of individual ClpB hexamers trapped within lipid vesicles. Using single-molecule FRET, we find that translocation occurs in milliseconds, far exceeding ATP hydrolysis rate. We further observe partial substrate engagement events and even translocation proceeding in both directions through the lumen of ClpB. Rather than generating discrete power strokes, ATP appears to act by regulating substrate engagement and translocation directionality. These results indicate a fast, stochastic mechanism akin to a Brownian motor, redefining how ATP is coupled with mechanical action in AAA+ machines.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

K.; Wong, A.; Wright, T.; Bizheva, K.", "abstract": "Significance: During their early stages of development, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases cause changes to the biological tissue's morphology, physiology and metabolism at cellular level, and acute, transient changes in the local blood flow. Development of novel optical methods for quantitative imaging of such changes non-invasively and simultaneously would allow for probing of neurovascular coupling in neural tissues and therefore can have a profound effect on furthering our understanding of neurodegeneration. Aim: To develop an optical imaging platform based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) for imaging and characterization of neurovascular coupling in the human retina with high spatial and temporal resolution. Approach: A fast, ultrahigh resolution OCT system was developed and combined with a clinical electroretinography (ERG) system for in-vivo, simultaneous structural, functional and vascular imaging of the human retina in response to visual stimulation. Novel image processing algorithms were developed to quantify visually-evoked physiological and blood flow changes from the OCT images and explore neurovascular coupling in the healthy human retina. Results: Visual stimulation of the human retina with singe flashes (white light, 4ms duration) caused transient changes in the optical reflectivity and thickness (optical pathlength difference) of major retinal layers, as well as the blood flow in local retinal blood vessels. The time courses of the neuronal and blood flow changes were correlated, and their magnitude was dependent on the intensity of the visual stimulus. Conclusions: We have developed an optical imaging modality for non-invasive probing of neurovascular coupling in the living human retina and demonstrated its utility and clinical potential in a pilot study on healthy subjects. This imaging platform could serve as a useful clinical research tool for investigation of potentially blinding retinal diseases, as well as neurodegenerative brain diseases that are expressed in the retina such as Alzheimer's and Parkinsons.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

O.; Li, H.", "abstract": "Efficient nucleic acid extraction and purification are crucial for cellular and molecular biology research, yet they pose challenges for large-scale clinical RNA sequencing and PCR assays. Here, we present BLADE-R, a magnetic bead-based protocol that simplifies the process by combining cellular lysis and nucleic acid binding into a single step, followed by a unique on-bead rinse for nuclease-free separation of genomic DNA and RNA. The Agilent TapeStation and RT-qPCR analyses show that RNA extracted from HEK293T cell line using BLADE-R outperforms the TRIzol protocol in terms of time and cost. RNA sequencing reveals no differences in sequence quality or gene count variance between samples processed with BLADE-R and those processed with TRIzol followed by RNA kit clean-up. Additionally, BLADE-R outperformed TRIzol in RNA extraction from frozen tissue and whole blood samples, as confirmed by RT-qPCR. Our protocol can be adapted to a 96-well plate format, enabling RNA purification of up to 96 human blood samples in less time than a single-sample traditional extraction. Using BLADE-R in this format, we confirmed minimal well-to-well contamination in RNA purification, cDNA synthesis, and PCR. Therefore, our novel BLADE-R protocol, suitable for both low and high-throughput formats, is effective even in limited-resource settings for preparing clinical samples for PCR and sequencing assays. Thus, our new BLADE-R technique works well even in low-resource environments to prepare clinical samples for PCR and sequencing experiments.

M.; Vrecko, V.; McKey, D.; Hossaert, M.", "abstract": "The Sahel is among the world's regions most affected by ecosystem degradation, caused by intensive land use and climate change. The importance of conserving biotic interactions is increasingly recognised in actions that attempt to counter and reverse this degradation, such as the Great Green Wall initiative in the northern Sahel. Interactions between flowers and flower-visiting insects play central roles in ecosystem functioning, ensuring pollination. Floral resources are also crucial for numerous other biotic interactions, as flower-visiting insects use them as fuel in their search for prey, hosts, breeding sites, and other resources. Despite their importance in ecosystem functioning, very little is known about insect-flower interactions in the northern Sahel. Using two capture methods, netting and pan traps, we studied interactions between insects and flowers of Balanites aegyptiaca, sampling in three sites in a single locality: a topographical depression with higher tree density, a \"restored\" site with exclusion of livestock and an \"unrestored\" site in intensively grazed rangeland. Each site was sampled at three different seasons to examine variation in this extremely harsh and seasonal environment. Balanites aegyptiaca is the region's most abundant tree. Its open-access flowers, produced in multiple flowering events each year, are a critical resource for insects. This species also produces economically important resources for the region's inhabitants. We found a surprisingly high diversity of insects visiting its flowers, comprising 371 morphospecies from 10 insect orders, with a predominance of Hymenoptera and Diptera. Insect abundance and diversity differed between seasons but only little between the different sites. Bees appear to be important pollinators. The bee fauna is dominated by solitary bees of the family Halictidae, which were abundant at all seasons. Diptera, particularly diverse families of small flies, were also frequent visitors and were particularly abundant and diverse in the wet season. Ants were abundant, but captures at flowers were frequent only in the dry season, when few resources other than flowers and flower-visiting insects were likely available to them. Insect abundance and observed diversity differed only little between sites, but estimated total diversity (Chao1 richness) was highest in the depression site. Insects visiting flowers of B. aegyptiaca included herbivores, decomposers, and parasitoids and predators of diverse arthropods, underlining the role of these floral resources in numerous facets of ecosystem functioning. The floral resources of B. aegyptiaca and other trees, which can flower throughout the year, are likely critical to assure the persistence of numerous insect species through the long dry season. It is crucial to integrate understanding of biotic interactions in management aimed at conservation and restoration of Sahelian ecosystems.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

E.; Staba, R.; Harris, N. G.", "abstract": "Reproducibility of scientific data is a current concern throughout the neuroscience field. There are multiple on-going efforts to help resolve this problem. Within the preclinical neuroimaging field, the continued use of a region-of interest (ROI) type approaches combined with the well-known spatial heterogeneity of traumatic brain injury pathology is a barrier to the replicability and repeatability of data. Here we propose the conjoint use of an unbiased analysis of the whole brain after injury together with a population-based statistical analysis of sham-control brains as one approach that has been used in clinical research to help resolve this issue. The approach produces two volumes of pathology that are outside the normal range of sham brains, and can be interpreted as whole brain burden of injury. Using diffusion weighted imaging derived scalars from a tensor analysis of data acquired from adult, male rats at 2, 9 days, 1 and 5 months after lateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI) and in shams (n=73 and 12, respectively), we compared a data-driven, z-score mapping method to a whole brain and white matter-specific analysis, as well as an ROI-based analysis with brain regions preselected by virtue of their large group effect sizes. We show that the data-driven approach is statistically robust, providing the advantage of a large group effect size typical of a ROI analysis of mean scalar values derived from the tensor in regions of gross injury, but without the large multi-region statistical correction required for interrogating multiple brain areas, and without the potential bias inherent with using preselected ROIs. We show that the technique correctly captures the expected longitudinal time-course of the diffusion scalar volumes based on the spatial extent of the pathology and the known temporal changes in scalar values in the LFPI model.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

The ventral striatum (VS) plays a key role in reward anticipation, and connectivity between the VS and the default mode network (DMN)-a network associated with self-referential and evaluative processes-has been implicated in reward processing. However, the relationship between these neural mechanisms and reward-related individual differences remains unclear. In the present study, we examined how trait reward sensitivity and behavioral motivation shape connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and the ventral striatum (VS) during reward anticipation. Forty-six participants completed the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task while undergoing fMRI, with trial types reflecting varying levels of reward and loss salience. Behavioral measures of motivation were derived from reaction time contrasts between large and neutral trials, and self-reported anhedonia and reward sensitivity were assessed. We found that individuals with higher reward sensitivity exhibited greater striatal connectivity with DMN during reward-salient trials, highlighting the VS's role in incentive processing. However, this relationship was moderated by behavioral motivation. Specifically, in individuals with high behavioral motivation, reward sensitivity was associated with reduced DMN-VS connectivity during reward anticipation. In contrast, for those with lower behavioral motivation, the relationship between reward sensitivity and DMN-VS connectivity was attenuated. These results provide novel insights into the neural correlates of individual differences in reward processing, demonstrating that behavioral motivation is crucial in understanding DMN-striatal interactions during reward anticipation. These findings highlight the importance of considering motivational context when investigating reward-related neural mechanisms.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

V.; Masuda, R.", "abstract": "A multi-layered genetic structure reflecting multiple demographic events across different time periods has been well documented particularly in modern humans. However, it is still unknown in wild species because of a lack of comprehensive genome-wide data on a global scale. The brown bear, Ursus arctos, exhibits a clear discrepancy between mitogenome- and nuclear genome-based phylogenetic trees. A previous study suggested that this discrepancy was caused by incomplete lineage sorting of the mitochondrial DNA lineages or recent expansion erasing the former genetic structure of the nuclear genome; however, neither scenario fully explained the discrepancy because genetic variation was observed across their habitat at different times. We performed whole-genome resequencing on nine brown bears from local populations around or on the Eurasian continent. The ancestral genetic characteristics have persisted in Western Asia and Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Tibet where minor mitochondrial haplotypes have been reported, whereas individuals from these areas shared few alleles with individuals speculated to possess many alleles from recent dispersal, which suggested that the recent ancestors of these populations had not experienced complete isolation from other populations. The Hokkaido and Etorofu (Iturup) Island populations obtained many alleles via gene flow from the polar bear Ursus maritimus; this finding was similar to that of a North American brown bear population previously reported to have hybridized with polar bears. This phenomenon may be attributed to less influence of recent expansion on island populations compared with that of continental populations. These results support our hypothesis and indicate that brown bears have a multi-layered genetic structure influenced by migration events at different times.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Migrating cortical interneurons remain in constant communication with both extracellular signals and intracellular machinery to maintain a directed migration into the cortical rudiment. In order to engage in directed migration, cortical interneurons undergo the cell biological process termed nucleokinesis in which interneurons translocate their cell bodies into a cytoplasmic swelling formed in the leading process. Many of the intracellular mechanisms governing the timing of migratory stream exit and cortical plate invasion are poorly understood yet are of fundamental importance to cortical development. We previously uncovered a requirement for the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in cortical interneuron migration. Disruption of the JNK signaling pathway resulted in a delayed entry of cortical interneurons into the cortex, as well as a premature departure from migratory streams. We are interested in uncovering the mechanisms by which JNK activity coordinates the intracellular processes essential for the guided migration of cortical interneurons. Our data shows, through the use of multiple ex vivo and in vitro assays, that cortical interneurons treated with JNK inhibitor exhibit major deficiencies in nucleokinesis. Additionally, we developed a novel tool to explore cortical interneuron migration using a nanopattern topography. Interneurons grown on nanopatterns have significantly faster migratory speeds and translocate further distances than cells cultured on a flat substrate. Interneurons grown on nanopatterns also display a different subcellular distribution of doublecortin, a known target of JNK signaling involved in microtubule stability and the guided migration of cortical interneurons. Overall, our results highlight the importance of JNK signaling in the guided migration of cortical interneurons.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

We observe that AT2s retain fate plasticity until the bZIP transcription factor C/EBP suppresses Notch signaling at a novel Dlk1 enhancer. Both Dlk1 and Cebpa are regulated by the polycomb repressive complex (PRC2), which together form a \"pulse generator\" circuit that times Dlk1 expression and thus Notch activation, resulting in a \"salt and pepper\" pattern of AT1 and AT2 fate. In injured adult lungs, C/EBP downregulation is required to re-access AT2 fate plasticity and is mediated by the dominant negative C/EBP family member CHOP.

TraA is a highly specific receptor, capable of recognizing other TraA proteins with identical or nearly identical sequences by homotypic binding, but the molecular basis of recognition is poorly understood. In this study, we designed a targeted TraA library, consisting of thousands of variants, which changed 10 predicted specificity residues. By screening this library, we identified TraA variants with different combinations of substitutions that resulted in altered recognition, often leading to promiscuous TraA-TraA binding. Additionally, we identified key residues that dictate specificity between distant TraA groups and showed that changing these residues altered the recognition specificity. Furthermore, we propose a model to explain how TraA recognition specificity evolved through the generation of intermediate promiscuous variants driven by reward/punishment interactions.

We conducted high-throughput antiviral drug screening using a host-directed kinase inhibitor library composed of 2,750 compounds against 2022 Clade IIb MPXV. Our primary screen identified 138 compounds preventing MPXV cytopathic effects, including multiple inhibitors of EGFR, PI3K-mTOR, and Ras/Raf, as well as apoptosis and autophagy regulators. Secondary and tertiary screenings yielded a shortlist of potent, nontoxic antiviral compounds that inhibited MPXV replication. Three selected compounds, IRAK4-IN-6, SM-7368, and KRAS inhibitor-10, reduced MPXV-induced cell death in primary human epidermal keratinocytes. IRAK4-IN-6 and SM-7368 were also found to modulate NF-{kappa}B and STING signaling. Furthermore, these compounds were found effective in reducing skin lesions and viral burden in a mouse model of MPXV skin infection. Together, our study reveals new classes of antiviral compounds against MPXV, offering promising candidates for future clinical development.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

To explore the possibilities and advantages of antiviral PROTACs, we have developed an antiviral PROTAC against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro) using an allosteric warhead. Here, we present the design of ten MPro degraders that were developed using pelitinib as a warhead, an allosteric binder of MPro. Among several candidates, LLP019 emerged as the most potent molecule, capable of degrading up to 90% of MPro after ectopic expression in HEK293F cells. LLP019 displayed significant antiviral activity against several variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 in infected Calu3 cells.

To date, the relative contribution of each developmental mechanism to the origins of neoteny remain unclear. We examined this question in the plant genus, Acacia, which contains species that undergo the juvenile-to-adult vegetative transition (vegetative phase change) early in shoot development, as well as species that remain permanently juvenile, or have delayed vegetative phase change. Mapping the timing of vegetative phase change onto a molecular phylogeny of Acacia revealed that permanent juvenility has evolved multiple times and is sometimes associated with a delay in vegetative phase change in related species. In three cases, the absence or delay in vegetative phase change was associated with either higher amounts or a delayed decline in level of miR156, the master regulator of vegetative phase change in plants.

Pattern formation involves communication through extracellular signals and complex intracellular gene networks integrating these signals to determine cell responses (e.g., further signaling, cell division, cell differentiation, etc.). In this article we ask: 1) Are there any logical or mathematical principles determining which gene network topologies can lead to pattern formation by cell signaling over space in multicellular systems? 2) Can gene network topologies be classified into a small number of classes that entail similar dynamics and pattern transformation capacities? In this article we combine logical arguments and mathematical proofs to show that, despite the large amount of theoretically possible gene network topologies, all gene network topologies necessary for pattern formation fall into just three fundamental classes and their combinations. We show that gene networks within each class share the same logic on how they lead to pattern formation and hence, lead to similar patterns. We characterize the main features of each class and discuss how they constitute an exhaustive zoo of pattern-forming gene networks. This zoo includes all gene networks that, to our knowledge, are experimentally known to lead to pattern formation as well as other gene networks that have not yet been found experimentally.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

A primary challenge, however, is that findings are often interpreted through binary distinctions between sets of stimuli (e.g. related/unrelated words, same/different semantic category). This approach ignores the analysis of individual words, which mirrors every-day language use and is crucial for understanding semantic cognition. In this work, we used semantic similarity, as measured by a language model, to investigate how Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) effects on semantic cognition unfold at the level of individual words. We re-analyzed 5 publicly available TMS datasets, covering multiple stimulation sites and lexical semantics tasks. We propose a simple methodology that can straightforwardly be applied to any TMS experiment on semantic cognition, and showcase its potential to generate new insights. We modelled trial-level response times using the language model and computed the correlation between the two. We also repeated the analyses for two lower-level variables (word frequency and length). Importantly, for each dataset, we compared correlations for effective and control (sham or vertex) stimulation conditions. We found that, for the language model, correlation was almost always significantly different depending on the type of stimulation (effective or control). Our results provide evidence that the stimulation effect interacts with the meaning of individual words. However, a similar pattern emerged in some cases for word frequency and length, suggesting that the effects of TMS on cognition can be widespread, well beyond their intended functional target. Collectively, our results demonstrate that language models provide new insight into the impact of neurostimulation on semantic processing, complementing standard measures.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Recent work has suggested that the mode of release also differs between classical and modulatory transmitters. Although many components of neurotransmitter release machinery have been identified, we still understand little about the mechanisms responsible for differences in release. In this study, we address the differences between release of dopamine and glutamate by comparing the composition of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that contain the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) versus vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2). Previous work has shown that these SV populations differ in frequency dependence, recycling kinetics and biogenesis. Taking advantage of a CRISPR-generated knock-in mouse with a cytoplasmic hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of VMAT2 to immunoisolate monoamine SVs, we find differences in the abundance and isoform expression of many SV protein families. Validation in primary neurons and in brain tissue confirms these differences in SV protein abundance between dopamine and glutamate release sites. Functional analysis reveals that the loss of differentially expressed SCAMP5 selectively impairs the recycling of VGLUT2 SVs, sparing VMAT2 vesicles in the same neuronal population. These findings provide new insights into the molecular diversity of SVs and the mechanisms that regulate the release of dopamine and glutamate, with implications for the physiological role of these transmitters and behavior.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Brain hemorrhage increases intracranial pressure through blood accumulation and brain swelling, leading to impaired cerebral blood flow, ischemia, and potentially, secondary injury, thus further exacerbating neurological damage. This study investigates the role of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in the injury response and clinical outcomes, focusing on their potential as therapeutic targets for intracranial pressure control after injury. To this end, we developed a sustained, resuscitated pig model of acute mixed intracranial bleeding with ICP and hemorrhagic shock. Multimodal brain monitoring and neurological assessments offered insights into the progression of the injury. Our findings showed that 36-48 hours post-injury, animals exhibited signs of cerebral tissue hypoxia, neuroinflammation, and extensive tissue damage. Elevated HIF1- expression in the injured hemisphere confirmed local hypoperfusion. Inflammatory markers such as TNF-, CD68, and MMP-9 were upregulated in both hemispheres, reflecting a generalized neuroinflammatory response. Gene expression analysis revealed increased markers of vascular, astrocytic, and neuroimmune activation, particularly related to endothelial integrity and astrocyte activation. RTK expression analysis showed increased levels of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, Tie-2, EGFR, and Axl in the injured cortex, with activation of EGFR/ErbB4 and HGFR/Met pathways. Hierarchical clustering of our transcriptional analysis revealed distinct patterns of activation, highlighting the direct relationship between severity of ICP increase and astrocyte response. In particular, EGFR phosphorylation correlated with i) severity of ICP increase, ii) neurological evaluation using a modified Glasgow Coma Scale, and iii) survival.

Blocking visual access or replacing the partner with an automated agent disrupted coordination.

We show that the grapevine core microbiome is dominated by phylum Bacillota and Pseudomonadota. Leveraging HiFi long-read sequencing technology, we assembled 19 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the grapevine pan-microbiome, representing the first MAG reconstruction in plant-associated microbial communities using HiFi long reads. These MAGs encode genes associated with antibiotic resistance, secondary metabolism, and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), which could potentially influence grapevine biology. During downy mildew (DM) infection, DM-resistant grapevines exhibit significantly higher microbial network complexity than susceptible counterparts. Among the key taxa contributing to this complexity, Bacillota emerged as the dominant phylum with displaying strong abundance correlations with phylum Euglenozoa and Cyanobacteriota, and an isolated Bacillota species from the grapevine leaves, Bacillus cereus, demonstrated potent biocontrol activity against DM infection. Pan-metatranscriptomic analysis further revealed significant upregulation of eukaryotic microbial genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism.

We isolated and sequenced the genomes of 15 spontaneous resistant mutants and found that 10 had acquired novel CRISPR spacers targeting the phage, with a total of 18 new spacers identified. Additionally, eight strains contained mutations in rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide (RGP) biosynthetic genes, three of which also acquired spacers. Only the rgp mutants exhibited defects in phage absorption, supporting the role of these cell surface glycans as the phage receptor. Mutations in rgpF and the newly identified gene rgpX led to severe cell division defects and impaired biofilm formation, the latter of which shared by the rgpD mutant. Thus, rgp mutations confer phage resistance but impose severe fitness costs, limiting pathogenic potential. Surprisingly, we found that {phi}APCM01 was capable of binding to and injecting its genome into UA159, a model serotype c strain.

In this paper, we offer an information-theoretic account of the costs associated with context-dependent decisions. According to this account, the brain's limited capacity to store context-dependent policies necessitates \"compression\" of policies into internal representations with an upper bound on code length, quantified by an information-theoretic measure (policy complexity). These representations are decoded into actions by sequentially inspecting each bit, such that longer codes take more time to decode. When a response deadline is imposed, the account predicts that policy complexity should increase with the deadline. Higher policy complexity is associated with several behavioral signatures: (i) higher accuracy; (ii) lower variability; and (iii) lower perseveration. Analyzing data from a rule-based action selection task, we found evidence supporting all of these predictions. We further hypothesized that complex policies require higher neural dimensionality (which constrains the code space). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that policy complexity correlates with a measure of neural dimensionality in a rule-based decision task.

Effective targeting of complement in NDDs requires understanding of its source - in particular, which brain cells express complement genes, how expression is regulated, and how expression changes in disease. To address this knowledge gap, we identified and integrated single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) datasets from 398,097 nuclei across 48 hippocampal samples from non-demented brains to create a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas of complement gene expression (the complementome) in the healthy brain. Expression levels of genes encoding complement components, receptors, and regulators were analysed across different brain cell types, and the impact of sex and age on complement gene expression was tested. To test the impact of disease, we generated a further atlas from datasets comprising 11 non-demented and 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient hippocampi to assess changes in complement gene expression in AD. All glial cells in the non-demented hippocampus expressed complement genes. C1QA/B/C genes were exclusively expressed in microglia, while C3 was highly expressed in microglia and astrocytes. Notably, C3 expression defined a subset of pro-inflammatory microglia. Complement receptor-encoding genes (C3AR1, C5AR2, ITGAM, ITGAX, ITGB2, VSIG4) were predominantly expressed in microglia, while neurons expressed a set of brain-specific putative receptors (NPTX1/2, NPTXR, NRP1). Endothelial cells abundantly expressed key regulators (CD46, CD55, CD59, CFH), while neurons and OPCs expressed a set of putative regulators (CSMD1/2/3 and SUSD4). Astrocytes abundantly expressed CLU. Cell type-specific gender differences included higher expression of C1QA/B/C, C1R, and C1S in female microglia, and higher expression of ITGAM and ITGAX in male microglia. Generally, higher complement gene expression was seen in older donors. Compared to controls, AD microglia showed higher expression of C1QB and C3, and AD astrocytes showed higher C1S and C3 expression. Expression of ITGAX was elevated in AD microglia compared to controls, while many AD cell types demonstrated reduced expression of brain-specific putative receptors.

This study investigated hemispheric lateralization in 35 adults with dyslexia and 35 matched controls using functional MRI across three language tasks: word generation, rhyming decision, and lexical decision. Laterality indices (LIs) were calculated to comprehensively assess the strength, direction, and consistency of activation across global and regional task-specific brain areas. No significant group differences were found in the absolute strength of lateralization for either global or regional measures. Directional asymmetry was similar across the two groups, except in the fusiform gyrus during the reading task, where dyslexic individuals showed a higher prevalence of right-hemisphere lateralization compared to controls. Importantly, we found that dyslexic participants demonstrated greater inconsistency in regional lateralization during the reading and rhyming tasks. Among individuals with dyslexia, those with inconsistent lateralization in the reading task had lower reading performance and weaker fusiform lateralization, although fusiform LI strength itself did not predict reading outcomes. Our findings suggest that dyslexia is characterized by inconsistent, rather than universally weaker, lateralization patterns.

The species C. parvum is zoonotic and causes significant morbidity and mortality for both humans and farm animals; most commonly, calves and lambs. A One Health approach that integrates human, animal and environmental health perspectives is required to tackle this disease. Current treatments are limited and ineffective, meaning there is an urgent need to develop new anti-cryptosporidials both for human and animal health. The neonatal calf model is a natural model of infection employed as a tool for drug discovery or generating parasite material. However, the model is seldom utilised to investigate host-parasite interaction. Fundamental information about this model, including the location of the parasite in the gut, is lacking. It is also unclear how the more commonly utilised immunocompromised mouse models of cryptosporidiosis compare to the neonatal calf model. To address this, we established an acute, moderate experimental C. parvum infection in neonatal calves. Using transgenic parasites, we created a tissue atlas of infection for neonatal calf gut and immunocompromised mouse models and mapped and quantified infection to draw robust comparisons between models. Cryptosporidium infection was observed at high levels throughout the neonatal calf gastrointestinal tract and was not limited to the ileal-cecal junction, as previously suggested. This infection pattern is most similar to the acute interferon-gamma knockout (IFN{gamma}KO) mouse model. Infection with transgenic parasites allowed us to perform in vivo and ex vivo tissue imaging of the chronic cryptosporidiosis mouse model, NOD SCID Gamma KO (NSG) mice. In contrast, in NSG mice infection is low in the small intestines and highest in the caecum and colon. Understanding the true distribution of infection in the gastrointestinal tract of these three key animal models provide new perspectives on how to interpret and design drug efficacy studies and provides new insight into host-pathogen interaction.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

However, it often encounters challenges related to low efficiency of donor DNA templates insertion through homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway or unwanted insertions and/or multiplications. Here, we present findings from multiple targeting experiments aimed at generating a Nup93 conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model. Injection of CRISPR/Cas9 components into over two thousand zygotes, resulted in 270 founder animals. Our study revealed various obstacles associated with the use of single-stranded (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) templates during cKO generation, highlighting the critical role of denaturation of long 5'-monophosphorylated dsDNA templates in enhancing precise genome editing and reducing template multiplications. Application of RAD52 protein increased HDR efficiency of ssDNA integration almost 4-fold, albeit with an associated increase in template multiplication. Targeting the antisense strand of DNA using two crRNAs demonstrated better efficacy in HDR-mediated precise genome editing when compared to targeting the sense or sense-antisense strands. In addition, the application of 5'-end biotin-modified donor DNA resulted in up to a 8-fold increase in HDR-mediated single-copy template integration compered to unmodified dsDNA donor. Furthermore, application of 5'-end C3 spacer modified template resulted in up to a 20-fold increase in correctly HDR modified mice independent from ssDNA or dsDNA template employment. This study underscores potential pitfalls in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and offers simple practical solutions to refine this potent tool.

We performed an explorative study at the dynamic first month of life, to compare the composition of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome and stomach gene expression of mice neonatally infected with H. pylori with that of uninfected mice. We found that H. pylori was present only in the stomach, and that H. pylori loads increase with age from one week after infection and onwards, especially after weaning. Stomach and colon microbiome composition was strikingly similar between sites at the same sampling time, but changed significantly over one week, with increased diversity at both sites. Despite that the relative abundance of H. pylori in the stomach was low and never exceeded 3%, the composition and alpha diversity of the gastrointestinal microbiome was significantly affected by infection. In a pathway enrichment analysis we found that stomach gene expression related to the extracellular matrix, muscle contraction, and metabolism was affected by infection. Expression of these key processes was, in infected mice, shifted away from that of control mice, towards that of all mice sampled the subsequent week, which we speculate represents accelerated development in infected mice.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

D.; Zhong, Q.; Brisson, J. A.", "abstract": "A fundamental focus of evolutionary-developmental biology is uncovering the genetic mechanisms responsible for the gain and loss of characters. One approach to this question is to investigate changes in the coordinated expression of a group of genes important for the development of a character of interest (a gene regulatory network). Here we consider the possibility that modifications to the wing gene regulatory network (wGRN), as defined by work primarily done in Drosophila melanogaster, were involved in the evolution of wing dimorphisms of the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). We hypothesize that this may have occurred via changes in expression levels or duplication followed by sub-functionalization of wGRN components. To test this, we annotated members of the wGRN in the pea aphid genome and assessed their expression levels in first and third nymphal instars of winged and wingless morphs of males and asexual females. We find that only two of the 32 assessed genes exhibit morph-biased expression. We also find that three wing genes (apterous (ap), warts (wts), and decapentaplegic (dpp)) have undergone gene duplication. In each case, the resulting paralogs show signs of functional divergence, exhibiting either sex-, morph-, or stage-specific expression. Two gene duplicates, wts2 and dpp3, are of particular interest with respect to wing dimorphism, as they exhibit a wingless male-specific isoform and wingless male-biased expression, respectively. These results supplement our understanding of trends in developmental gene network evolution, such as side-stepping pleiotropic constraint via duplication and sub-functionalization, underlying the emergence of novel phenotypes.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Here we employed OTTR-seq to comprehensively profile tRNA modifications across nine archaeal species spanning diverse ecological niches, including thermophiles, methanogens, acidophiles, and halophiles.

Comparative genomic analyses revealed clear associations between modifications and evolutionary changes in enzyme domain architectures, including divergence in homologs of Trm14, Trm10, Trm11, and Trm1. We also expanded upon previously characterized identity elements in the D-stem, such as the conserved G10oU25 pair critical for Trm11 specificity, providing additional insight into determinants that likely govern enzyme-substrate interactions.

However, these same factors may also facilitate the emergence of viruses already circulating in local vector populations. The use of metagenomics to assess mosquito viromes has expanded in recent decades, enabling the detection of both arboviruses and insect-specific viruses (ISVs), and helping to fill gaps in our understanding of virus circulation. In particular, zoological collections are potential interfaces for virus transmission between mosquitoes, animals, and humans, making them valuable sentinel sites for surveillance. Although mosquito virome studies have been conducted globally, UK mosquito populations remain comparatively understudied. To address this gap, we investigated the viromes of two key mosquito species, Culex pipiens s.l. and Culiseta annulata, through metagenomic sequencing of specimens collected at two UK zoos between 2021 and 2022. A total of 4,042 mosquitoes underwent sequencing across 44 pools, leading to the identification of 26 viral genomes, including nine novel species spanning RNA and DNA virus families. Viral distribution patterns revealed viruses shared across all pools, supporting the possibility of a conserved virome between mosquito species. Notably, two novel Orthobunyavirus species (Family Peribunyaviridae), Atherstone and Deva viruses, were detected. These represent the first documented mosquito-associated orthobunyaviruses in the UK, a genus that includes several known pathogens. Classification using the machine-learning tool MosViR suggests Atherstone virus, present at both zoos, is a putative arbovirus warranting further investigation. Supporting this is the presence of a non-structural protein S (NSs), a known virulence factor in orthobunyaviruses. In contrast, Deva virus had no NSs ORF and was not predicted to be an arbovirus. These findings improve our understanding of UK mosquito viruses, indicate possible risks to people or animals from orthobunyaviruses, and highlight the role of metagenomic surveillance in detecting emerging viral threats.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Upon therapy interruption, reactivation of the persistent HIV-1 reservoir propagates viral rebound and mediates continued immunological decline. While furthering understanding of the HIV-1 reservoir is essential for HIV-1 cure, commonly used sequencing strategies are often limited by the reliance on short-read sequencing across separate assays to determine integration sites and proviral integrity - something that does not always adequately resolve complex human genomic repeats or low complexity regions. Simultaneous identification of proviral integration sites and proviral integrity at the single molecule level would enable HIV-1 reservoir characterization with minimal imputation or bioinformatic reconstruction. Here we present HIV Single Molecule Real Time Capture (HIV SMRTcap), a novel molecular and computational pipeline that directly and simultaneously identifies HIV-1 integration sites, defines proviral integrity, and characterizes clonal expansion of HIV-1 provirus-containing cells with single molecule resolution. In combination with long-read, single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing and custom analytic pipelines, HIV SMRTcap enables a highly comprehensive characterization of HIV-1 reservoirs. Moreover, we demonstrate here that HIV SMRTcap performs robustly across the major global subtypes (HIV-1 subtype A, B, C, D and A/D recombinant viruses), and can use both cell- and tissue-derived inputs, including samples from antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated individuals with undetectable viral loads. Our results demonstrate that HIV SMRTcap serves as a comprehensive, robust method for unbiased HIV-1 reservoir characterization. Used alone, or in combination with single-cell based methods, HIV SMRTcap will enable novel exploration of viral reservoirs across subtypes and in tissue-specific compartments, providing critical information needed to inform HIV-1 cure.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

This study reproduces and validates the AF2Rank pipeline, which utilizes AlphaFold intrinsic confidence metrics predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) and predicted Template Modeling score (pTM) to evaluate and rank decoy protein structures without dependence on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The pipeline was implemented locally using the Rosetta decoy dataset, overcoming reproducibility challenges such as software dependency conflicts, residue indexing inconsistencies, and system-level execution issues. This framework successfully enabled high-confidence evaluation of over 1000 decoys for a benchmark target (1a32), with ongoing expansion to 133 protein targets. Notably, we discovered that AlphaFold confidence metrics encode protein-specific \"fingerprints,\" enabling reverse classification of structures to their source proteins. Our XGBoost-based classifier achieved 61.5% accuracy across 133 distinct protein targets, substantially exceeding random chance (0.75%). Feature importance analysis revealed that traditional energy functions (Rosetta normalized score, 26%) and derived interaction features (pLDDT-pTM ratio, 16%) provide the strongest discriminative power, suggesting AlphaFold metrics capture meaningful biological and structural information beyond generic quality assessment. Building upon this foundation, a novel hypothesis is introduced: Context-Aware Refinement of AlphaFold Predictions(CAR-AF). This approach postulates that AlphaFold-predicted structures may be further improved through refinement in the presence of their native binding partners such as receptors or ligands thereby producing conformations that are both structurally and functionally enhanced. The proposed methodology comprises four stages: generation of initial predictions via AlphaFold, structural modeling of relevant binding partners, docking of predicted proteins into these biological contexts, and refinement of the resulting complexes using molecular modeling tools such as Rosetta or HADDOCK. Structural and energetic metrics including TM-score, RMSD, and binding energy will be used to assess potential improvements in predictive quality.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Our snRNA-seq profiling uncovered differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across multiple cell types, including transcriptional signatures of enhanced synaptic transmission in upper-layer pyramidal neurons of the AD+P cortex.

This neuronal response is associated with microglial exhaustion and astrocytic inflammation signatures triggered by layer-specific neuropathological changes in the brains of AD+P patients.

Pharmacological blockade of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain lowered oxygen consumption and mitochondrial ROS by reducing NF-{kappa}B signaling.

Integrative RNA sequencing and ChIP sequencing analyses identified genome-wide cortisol-responsive immunoregulatory genes. Genetic deletion of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, encoded by NR3C1) abolished cortisol-induced gene expression changes, confirming GR-dependency.

A promising strategy to enhance crop resilience against drought is the utilisation of root channels left by winter cover crops, which can improve access to subsoil water and nutrients for subsequent cash crops like maize (Zea mays L.). The impact of drought on bacterial communities inhabiting these root channels remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated drought-induced shifts in maize rhizosphere bacterial communities and their functional adaptation in cover crop root channels across three soil types in northern Germany (Luvisol, Podzol, and Phaeozem). Results: Using a multi-omics approach (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, qPCR, and metaproteomics), we identified significant taxonomic and functional responses to drought. A rise in the abundance of K-strategist bacterial communities indicate a shift towards stress-tolerant populations with drought. Under drought stress, the relative abundances of Acidobacteriota, Actinomycetota, Planctomycetota, and Pseudomonadota increased, while Chloroflexota, Methylomirabilota, Ca. Patescibacteria, and Verrucomicrobiota declined. Functional analyses revealed that drought-stressed aerobic taxa among the Pseudomonadota and Verrucomicrobiota upregulated the glyoxylate cycle, potentially enhancing carbon and energy conservation, and increased antioxidant defences (catalase-glutathione peroxidase and methionine cycle-transsulfuration pathway). These drought-mitigating strategies were especially pronounced in root channels formed by Brassicaceae and Poaceae cover crops in the Luvisol and Podzol soils.

Some types tend to occurr as the sole Cas present, but typically comprise two or more arrays, especially for types I-E and I-F. Multiple Cas types are also common, with some systems showing a preference for specific co-occurrence. Distinct array distributions and orientations around Cas loci indicate substantial differences in functionality and transcriptional behavior among Cas types. Our analysis suggests that arrays with identical repeats in the same genome acquire new spacers at comparable rates, irrespective of their proximity to the Cas locus. Furthermore, repeat similarities in our data set indicate that arrays of systems that often co-occur with other systems tend to have more diverse repeats than those mostly appearing alongside solitary systems within the genome. Our analysis suggests that co-occurring Cas type pairs might not only collaborate in spacer acquisition but also maintain independent and complementary functions and that CRISPR systems distribute their defensive spacer repertoire equally across multiple CRISPR arrays.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

While Arf1 and Arf6 deficiency results in embryonic lethality, in vivo functions of cytohesins are rarely described and mostly inconspicuous. We analyzed the role of cytohesin-2 in vivo and in vitro and found that cytohesin-2 full knockout mice die within one day after birth. Mass spectrometry-based organellar proteomics in wildtype and CRISPR-Cas9-generated cytohesin-2-/- C2 myoblasts revealed a markedly altered Golgi compartment. Golgi volumes were reduced in different cytohesin-2-/- cell lines compared to wildtype cells as revealed by immunofluorescence. Reduced Golgi volumes were rescued by introducing cytohesin-2. Finally, we observed that typical functions of the Golgi apparatus were disrupted in cytohesin-2-deficient cells. Cytohesin2-/- C2 myoblasts exhibited significant changes in the galactose / N-acetyl-galactosamine glycosylation on the cell surface compared to wildtype cells when stained with peanut agglutinin. Further, protein secretion was overall reduced in neonatal cytohesin-2-/- mice compared to wildtype as determined by mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

It has been found in various human bodily fluids and is a potential reproductive toxicant. However, the effect of TCS on early embryo development in mammalian species is limited. We therefore asked whether exposure to TCS affects mammalian cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs), and if so, whether the effects persist into the early embryo. COCs, isolated from abattoir-derived bovine ovaries were exposed to two environmentally relevant doses of TCS (1 nM and 10 nM) during in vitro maturation. When exposed to 1 nM TCS during in vitro maturation, progesterone release from bovine oocytes was elevated. Furthermore, altered pyruvate metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction also observed; specifically, O2 consumption coupled to ATP production was significantly decreased in COCs after acute exposure of TCS prior to maturation, whereas proton leak from the respiratory chain was increased. Subsequently, TCS-exposed COCs were fertilised. Fewer oocytes were able to develop to blastocyst when exposed to 1 nM TCS during maturation compared to the Control group (12.22% vs 29.11% n=5; p=0.02) and those that did reach the blastocyst displayed impaired glycolytic and amino acid metabolic activity. These findings indicate for the first time that oocytes exposed to TCS during the final stages of maturation give rise to embryos with impaired mitochondria function, altered steroidogenesis and disrupted metabolic activity.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Contrary to the common assumption that PGCs directly develop into germline stem cells (GSCs), recent mammalian data and our zebrafish observations suggest a more complex picture. We hypothesized that individual PGCs contribute differentially to gonad development. To test this hypothesis, we developed two Cre-based lineage tracing systems and demonstrate that PGCs give rise to at least four distinct clone types in zebrafish. We observed no restriction in clone type localization along the anterior-posterior axis, suggesting these differences are PGC intrinsic or locally determined. Further examination of the ovarian reserve revealed functional evidence that some PGCs generate self-renewing GSCs, while others produce non-renewing progenitors that are depleted with successive matings. Collectively, our findings propose a revised model of vertebrate germline establishment with implications to reproductive lifespan. This model suggests that differentiation potential varies among PGCs, allowing individual PGCs to directly differentiate into multiple distinct germ cell types, including renewing GSCs and transient populations that contribute to an early wave of gametes.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Traits such as size, weight, and morphology can be used to predict the insect specimen age and help estimate the time since death. The blowfly Phormia regina is a key forensic insect, yet age estimation for older maggots in this species is particularly challenging due to the limited morphological changes in the late-stage larvae. To enhance precision, we employed transcriptomic profiling on blowfly maggots, aiming to identify genes as markers for time of death estimation. Our study characterized maggot development, reinforcing that weight and behavior cannot precisely determine age between 100 and 130 hours. We built a chromosomal scale annotated genome, establishing a reliable database for uncovering transcriptomic signatures during larval development. Applying differential gene expression analyses, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and the generalized linear model, we identified nine candidate genes (Y5078, Y5076, agt2, ech1, dhb4, asm, gabd, acohc, Ivd) that delineate the age of otherwise indeterminate maggots.

Many studies have explored different materials and active cues to guide neural regeneration, with some success. However, none have demonstrated a comparable or better functional recovery than the clinical standard autograft. Autografts are often insufficient for reconstruction of an injury to long nerves such as the sciatic or brachial plexus. Synthetic nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) have been investigated for these injuries to guide axonal regeneration and lead to functional recovery. We have designed a biologics-free hydrogel-based multi-channel conduit with defined microscale features to guide axonal outgrowth. To investigate extraneural vascular infiltration and its effects on functional recovery, we also designed a multi-microchannel conduit with defined regularly spaced micropores, orthogonal to the axon guidance channels. Using our custom-built Rapid Projection, Image-guided, Dynamic (RaPID) bioprinting system, we are able to fabricate each hydrogel conduit within minutes from a milliliter-volume prepolymer vat. With our state-of-the-art printing platform, we have achieved NGCs with a consistent channel wall width of 10 microns. We implanted the NGCs for 17 weeks in a murine sciatic nerve transection injury model. We assessed the functional recovery by dynamic gait analysis throughout the recovery period and by compound muscle action potential (CMAP) electrophysiology before NGC harvesting. Both the non-porous and micro-porous conduit groups led to functional nerve regeneration on par with the autograft group.

Material testing confirmed biocompatibility, while vinyl cutting reproducibility demonstrated high manufacturing fidelity. The platform reliably supported long-term culture (up to 14 days), and the open insert format facilitated uniform seeding and imaging access.

Automation has improved various stages of this process, from compound procurement to data analysis, supporting small molecules, peptides, and oligonucleotides. However, challenges remain, particularly in the time-consuming analysis of samples for metabolite identification. This article introduces new algorithms for automated Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS) data applicable to both small and macromolecules. While methodologies for small molecules are well established, adapting them for macromolecules presents challenges, including computational demands, peak detection complexities, and visualization issues. A data analysis employing diverse algorithms in the data preprocessing step was conducted across six datasets, ranging from small/medium linear or macrocyclic peptides to oligonucleotides with natural and unnatural monomers. Two peak detection approaches were evaluated: using the monoisotopic mass versus the most abundant isotope for mass calculation.  Additionally, an exploration of two distinct structure visualization options was conducted for one of the datasets. Furthermore, data obtained through two different acquisition modes was processed. The computational time required for data processing was recorded throughout, ranging from 5 minutes to 2 hours per experiment. The results have been compared against prior studies, revealing substantial reductions in processing time, consistent identification of degradation products, and improved visualization techniques, thereby enhancing result interpretation. A comprehensive identification of 970 metabolites was achieved under varied incubation conditions across the six datasets, showcasing the workflow's efficiency in managing experimental data within a molecular range from 700 to 7630 Daltons (Da). Particularly in larger molecules, the most abundant mass algorithm demonstrated higher scores and a greater number of matches, instilling greater confidence in the accurate prediction of metabolite structures.

Using clinically relevant models of triple-negative breast and non-small lung cancer cells we previously showed that these cells respond to repeated paclitaxel exposure by inter alia lysosome enrichment in ABCC3, ABCC5 and ABCC10, which contribute to drug sequestration in these organelles and reduced drug cytotoxicity. In this study we provide experimental evidence that transcription of above mentioned ABCC genes is enabled by BRG1-based SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Pharmacological inhibition of SWI/SNF with PFI3 or ACBI1, the PROTAC degrader of SMARCA2/4, substantially decline transcription of ABCC3, ABCC5 and ABCC10. Similar effect is caused by transient silencing of SMARCA4 (BRG1), but not SMARCA2 (BRM). The deficiency of BRG1 led to extralysosomal distribution of anticancer drugs, their deeper penetration of spheroids and substantial increase in drug cytotoxicity. Interestingly, in BRG1 deficient cell line paclitaxel triggered mutations, which reverted BRG1 truncating deletion in SMARCA4, thereby restoring SWI/SNF ATPase expression in paclitaxel-resistant cells and increasing transcription of ABCC. Acquisition of drug resistance was associated with BRG1 redistribution in the genome, de novo occurrence at the promoters of genes functionally linked to endo-lysosomal system and stronger co-occurrence with EP300.

The SV2A-BRV-UCB1244283 complex reveals how UCB1244283 allosterically enhances BRV binding by occupying an allosteric site near the primary binding site, preventing BRV dissociation. This allosteric site, formed by hydrophobic and uncharged residues, is a novel small-molecule binding site in SV2A. Structural analysis and mutagenesis suggest that an allosteric network between the primary and allosteric sites governs high-affinity ASM binding. UCB1244283 selectively binds SV2A over SV2B and SV2C, with specific mutations disrupting binding. The structure explains why UCB1244283 binding to SV2A selectively allows interaction with specific ASMs but not others due to steric hinderance. Structural comparison reveals that distinct conformational differences between the SV2A-BRV-UCB1244283 and other SV2A-ligand complexes, particularly in the transmembrane domain, influence binding at both sites.

The cell populations that respond to disease-inducing stimuli in these models and their relationship to human disease remain incompletely defined. Materials and methods: This study analyzed the relationship between several rodent models of PH and human disease at single-cell resolution. scRNA-seq was performed on lungs from mice exposed to hypoxia or Sugen/hypoxia, rats exposed to monocrotaline, and controls. A cross-species single-cell dataset was integrated with human lung cell atlas (HLCA) and single-cell dataset from idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) to identify overlapping cell subsets between experimental and human disease and species. Results: High levels of overlap were found between species and models of PH, HLCA, and IPAH datasets. Cell subsets perturbed in rat and mouse PH were similar to those found in human disease, with macrophages and endothelial cells being most affected. A novel Dhcr24high macrophage subset harboring both tissue-remodeling and pro-inflammatory features was consistently increased across models. Several functionally diverse endothelial subtypes were found, including novel Ednrb+ and Nox2+ subpopulations, reflecting enhanced apoptosis, dysregulated angiogenesis and proliferation, and reactive oxygen species-mediated stress. These macrophage and endothelial subtypes expressed numerous PH drug target genes, and exhibited potential disease-specific intercellular interactions involving Angptl4, Cxcl12, and Sema3 signaling.

S.; Toh, Y. P.; Loupasaki, T.; Hodge, E. A.; el Jundi, B.; Montgomery, S. H.", "abstract": "Neural circuits have evolved to produce cognitive processes that facilitate a species variable behavioural repertoire. Underlying this variation are evolutionary forces, such as selection, that operate on changes to circuitry against a background of constraints. The interplay between selection and potentially limiting constraints determine how circuits evolve. Understanding how this process operates requires an evolutionary framework that facilitates comparative analysis of neural traits, within a clear behavioural and functional context. We leverage a large radiation of Heliconiini butterflies to examine how selection shapes the evolution of the central complex and the mushroom bodies, two integration centres in the insect brain involved in spatial navigation. Within the Heliconiini, one genus, Heliconius, performs systematic spatial foraging and navigation to exploit specific plants as a source of pollen, a novel dietary resource. Closely related genera within Heliconiini lack this dietary adaptation, and are more vagrant foragers. The evolution of increased spatial fidelity in Heliconius has led to changes in brain morphology, and in specific learning and memory profiles, over a relatively short evolutionary time scale. Here, using a dataset of 41 species, we show that in contrast to a massive expansion of the mushroom bodies, the central complex and associated visual processing areas are strongly conserved in size and general architecture. We corroborate this by characterising patterns of fine anatomical conservation, including conserved patterns in dopamine and serotonin expression. However, we also identify a divergence in the expression of a neuropeptide, Allatostatin A, in the noduli, and in the numbers of GABA-ergic ellipsoid body ring neurons and their branching in the fan-shaped body, which are essential members of the anterior compass pathway. These differences match expectations of where evolutionary adaptability might occur inside the central complex network and provide rare examples of divergence of these circuits in a shallow phylogenetic context. We conclude that due to the contrasting volumetric conservation of the central complex and the massive volumetric differences in the mushroom bodies, their circuit logics must determine distinct responses to selection associated with divergent foraging behaviours.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

We have investigated the role of ENAs in spore adhesion to abiotic surfaces using wild-type (WT) B. cereus spp. strains and isogenic mutants lacking ENAs or an intact exosporium. WT spores expressing both short and long ENAs (S+L+) adhered significantly more to stainless steel (SS) and polypropylene (PP) compared to bald spores (S-L-) and spores of an exosporium-deficient mutant ({Delta}exsY), while adhesion to polystyrene (PS) and glass was not significantly affected by the presence of ENAs. The {Delta}exsY mutant showed the lowest adhesion across all tested surfaces, a pattern also observed for vegetative cells. The individual roles of S-ENA and L-ENA were also assessed, where the strongest adhesion occurred when both fibers were present on PP. A trend also emerged on PP; WT remained adhered for an hour, while bald spores tended to detach within that time. For saline conditions and pH, bald spores adhered strongly to SS, while for non-ionic surfactant and concentrated protein solutions, WT spores exhibited the strongest adhesion.

In this study, we investigated the role of the host cellular clock during infection by Staphylococcus aureus, a highly drug-resistant, facultatively intracellular human pathogen. Our findings revealed that S. aureus invasion into epithelial cells is dependent on the cellular circadian phase. Interestingly, in BMAL1, an essential clock protein, deficient cells bacterial uptake was significantly higher compared to parental A549 cells. RNA sequencing of BMAL1 knockdown (KD) cells showed a significant upregulation of GP340, coding for the receptor of SraP, an S. aureus adhesin. An S. aureus mutant lacking SraP did not exhibit a circadian rhythm of uptake into A549 cells nor an increased uptake into BMAL1 KD compared to the parental A549 cells.

Its ability to thrive in diverse environments and disseminate antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) across ecological niches highlights the importance of understanding its ecological, evolutionary, and epidemiological dynamics. The CRISPR2 locus has been used as a valuable marker for assessing clonality and phylogenetic relationships in E. faecalis. In this study, we identified a group of E. faecalis strains lacking CRISPR2, forming a distinct, well-supported clade. We demonstrate that this clade meets the genomic criteria for classification as a novel subspecies, here referred to as \"subspecies B\". Through a comprehensive pangenome analysis and comparative genomics, we explored the adaptive ecological traits underlying this diversification process, identifying clade-specific features and their predicted functional roles. Our findings suggest that the frequent isolation of subspecies B from meat products and processing facilities may reflect dissemination routes involving environmental contamination (e.g., water, plants, soil) from avian species. The absence of key virulence traits required for pathogenicity in mammals, particularly humans, and the lack of clinically relevant resistance determinants indicate that subspecies B currently pose minimal threat to public health compared to the broadly disseminated \"subspecies A\". Nevertheless, the unclear potential for genetic exchange between these subspecies, and the frequent association of subspecies B with food sources, calls for continued genomic surveillance of E. faecalis from a One Health perspective to detect and mitigate the emergence of high-risk variants in advance.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Cell chirality participates in the left -right asymmetric morphogenesis and tissue integrity. However, the mechanisms of cell chirality formation remain elusive. In Drosophila, two evolutionarily conserved myosin I genes, Myosin 1D (Myo1D) and Myosin 1C (Myo1C), respectively, dictate the dextral and sinistral chirality of the cells and body. Here, we reported that Myo1D and Myo1C respectively directed the clockwise and counterclockwise circumferential flow of F-actin in Drosophila macrophages. Both induced the corresponding circular cytoplasm flows and depended on Myosin2 (Myo2). In a modified in vitro motility assay using near-physiological actin concentrations, Myo1D triggered the self-organization of the F-actin ring (chiral F-actin ring) that rotated clockwise; conversely, Myo1C induced the random flow of F-actin. The chiral F-actin ring implied that the F-actin bundle was parallelly and annularly polarized concerning its barbed pointed end. Considering that Myo1D and Myo1C are localized to the dorsal plasma membrane of macrophages, Myo1D and Myo1C might organize the parallelly polarized F-actin in macrophages. Our results suggest that Myo2 might drive the clockwise circumferential flow of F-actin along its parallel and annular polarity induced by Myo1D, which may be a molecular basis of cell and organ chirality.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

M.; Donker, L.; Godinho, S.; Nightingale, T. D.", "abstract": "Endothelial cells rapidly respond to blood vessel injury or infection by releasing haemostatic and inflammatory proteins from their secretory organelles called Weibel-Palade Bodies (WPBs). Upon stimulation, WPBs traffic to the cell surface to secrete cargo such as von Willebrand factor (VWF), essential for platelet recruitment, and P-selectin, which facilitates the capture and subsequent rolling of immune cells. While this process is critical, many aspects of WPB trafficking and exocytosis remain unclear particularly how release sites are selected across the cell surface and how fusion is directed to either the apical (lumen-facing) or basolateral (basement membrane-facing) side. These decisions directly impact the biological consequences and effectiveness of the secreted proteins. Using live-cell imaging, fibronectin micropatterning, loss-of-function and biochemical assays, we identified trafficking and release at hot spots near focal adhesions (FAs). We also discovered that the FA-resident guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), {beta}-PIX (ARHGEF7), regulates VWF secretion. {beta}-PIX is known to activate Rho GTPases (Cdc42/Rac), triggering downstream p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) signalling and cytoskeletal remodelling. Here, depletion of {beta}-PIX impaired VWF secretion and delayed its release by perturbing cytoskeletal reorganisation. Knockdown and rescue experiments using truncated mutants further revealed which domains of {beta}-PIX are necessary for exocytosis and cytoskeletal reorganisation. This is the first demonstration of {beta}-PIX's role in VWF secretion from endothelial cells and our data provides new insights into spatial targeting of WPB exocytosis. Such targeting may be essential for guiding leukocyte transmigration or platelet binding, thereby maintaining vascular integrity.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Vocal cord injection is a commonly utilized therapeutic approach to rectify this gap by augmenting vocal cord volume; however, the optimal injectable material remains undetermined. Dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs), derived from mature adipocytes, exhibit robust proliferative capacity and multipotency, establishing them as potential candidates for treating glottic insufficiency. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of DFATs in a rat model of recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. In the experimental design, the recurrent laryngeal nerve of each rat was resected unilaterally, and 5 weeks later, the atrophied vocal cord muscles were injected with either 10 l of saline (control), 1.0 x 106 DFATs in 10 l (DFAT group), or 1.0 x 106 DFATs combined with 500 ng of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in 10 l (DFAT + bFGF group). At 4 weeks post-injection, laryngeal endoscopy was performed to evaluate the glottic gap, followed by histological analyses to assess vocal muscle atrophy, collagen deposition, and markers of cellular proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (TUNEL). To confirm DFAT engraftment, GFP-labeled DFATs were evaluated at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-injection. Results indicated that both the DFAT and DFAT + bFGF groups exhibited significantly reduced glottic gaps, increased collagen deposition, and decreased TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells compared to controls. Notably, the DFAT + bFGF group displayed superior outcomes, including a greater vocal muscle area and enhanced Ki-67-positive cell proliferation, indicating mitigation of muscle atrophy. GFP-positive DFATs were detectable in the tissue for up to 6 weeks, confirming engraftment. These findings underscore the potential of DFATs, particularly in combination with bFGF, as an innovative and effective therapeutic approach for glottic insufficiency secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

In mammals, three PHD isoforms (PHD1-3) are responsible for proline hydroxylation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) alpha, a key regulator of the hypoxia response. In the accompanying paper (Jiang et al) we report development of a mass spectrometry-based method to reliably identify proline hydroxylation (OH-Pro) sites on proteins and use this to identify a PHD-dependent OH-Pro modification at Pro604 on the protein RepoMan (CDCA2), a regulatory subunit for protein phosphatase PP1{gamma}, with important roles in mitotic progression and cell viability. Here, we investigate the functional significance of hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604. During M phase, the PP1- RepoMan complex dephosphorylates Thr3 of Histone H3 (H3T3) on chromosomes arms to ensure the correct localisation of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) at centromeres. We show that siRNA depletion of PHD1, but not PHD2, increases H3T3 phosphorylation in prometaphase-arrested cells. In cells depleted of endogenous RepoMan, exogenous expression of wild type RepoMan, but not a RepoMan P604A mutant, restored normal H3T3 phosphorylation localisation in prometaphase arrested cells. RepoMan P604 is located proximal to the Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) that function as binding sites for the serine/threonine Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The interaction of RepoMan and PP2A-B56{gamma} is reduced in cells expressing RepoMan P604A. Moreover, analyses in both fixed and live cells released from a prometaphase arrest, show that expression of the RepoMan P604A mutant results in defects in chromosome alignment and segregation, leading to increased levels of cell death. These data support a role for PHD1-mediated prolyl hydroxylation in controlling progression through mitosis, acting, at least in part, via hydroxylation of RepoMan at P604 regulating the interaction of RepoMan with PP2A during chromosome alignment and thereby controlling the levels of Histone H3 phosphorylation at Thr3.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Rust fungi are a large group of obligate plant pathogens with complex life cycles and diverse reproductive modes. In the rust fungus Cronartium pini, which exists in both macrocyclic heteroecious and microcyclic autoecious forms, transitions between reproductive modes can be studied within a single species. Here, we used comparative genomics to analyse the structure, diversity, and organization of mating-type (MAT) loci across both forms of C. pini. We identified a canonical tetrapolar system in the heteroecious form, characterized by unlinked, multiallelic homeodomain (HD) and pheromone/receptor (P/R) loci, consistent with obligate outcrossing. In contrast, the autoecious form displayed distinct reproductive signatures, including MAT gene homozygosity in some samples, indicative of clonal reproduction, and MAT gene duplications in others, suggesting self-fertility or altered mating pathways. Three HD loci were detected, but only one exhibited high allelic diversity and was consistently present, indicating functional divergence. Expanded allelic diversity at the STE3.2 pheromone receptor further suggests plasticity at the P/R locus. Although allele sharing between life cycle forms was rare, isolated cases of shared MAT alleles suggest limited historical connectivity and possible trans-specific polymorphism. Together, our findings reveal flexibility in the mating system architecture of C. pini and suggest that transitions between sexual and asexual reproduction may be facilitated by retained, functionally ambiguous MAT structures. This work highlights C. pini as a powerful model for studying life cycle evolution and mating system transitions in rust fungi.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

We investigate the potential for predation to shape AM evolution across different combinations of three species comprising a multi-trophic food web. Together in a three-species community, the fruiting bacterium Myxococcus xanthus is a mesopredator, while the bacterivorous nematode Pristionchus pacificus is apex predator and the bacterium Escherichia coli is a shared basal prey for both predators. The number and morphology of M. xanthus fruiting bodies is found to respond evolutionarily to nematodes, regardless of whether E. coli is present. E. coli alone with M. xanthus tends to reduce both fruiting body formation and spore production, but adding nematodes eliminates those negative effects. M. xanthus lineages with an ancestral antibiotic-resistance mutation evolved less overall, revealing strong historical contingency and suggesting potential tradeoffs between antibiotic-resistance and responsiveness to biotic selection. Our results suggest that predation both of and by mesopredators has played important roles in the evolution of aggregative multicellularity and reveal complex inter-trophic evolutionary interactions in a relatively simple three-species food web.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Additionally, while selection on plant reproductive traits is predicted to be stronger through male fitness than female fitness, male fitness remains less studied. We investigated how selection on flowering traits in Brassica rapa varied temporally and spatially by measuring male reproductive fitness in four experimental populations with two spatial arrangements. To estimate longitudinal and cross-sectional selection, we introduced male-sterile plants at successive intervals. We genotyped over 3000 plants and calculated selection on flowering time, duration, and total flowers. Cross-sectional analyses revealed directional selection was common, but patterns were masked by longitudinal estimates. Comparing selection gradients and coefficients revealed conflicting selection directions, suggesting the importance of trait correlations in selection estimates.

In ants, social structure may contribute to queens' Reproductive Output (RO), alongside environmental conditions and genetic attributes. Polygynous species like the Neotropical trap-jaw ant, Odontomachus chelifer, are valuable biological systems to investigate the contribution of these factors to the RO of queens. We hypothesize that O. chelifer queens' RO increases with (1) higher multiple mating (polyandry) per queen; (2) higher queen heterozygosity; (3) greater food availability. We sampled workers from 18 colonies from the Brazilian Cerrado savanna (15 workers per colony) and used eight microsatellites to infer the number of male mates per queen, queens' heterozygosity, and the proportion of offspring produced per queen. The latter was used to calculate the index of deviation from even offspring production (DEM) among queens. Arthropod communities from sampling sites were used as a proxy for food resources availability. We evaluated the relationships between DEM and the predictor variables using bivariate generalized linear models. Our results showed a positive relationship between polyandry and DEM (Coefficient = 0.41, P < 0.001). It suggests that the number of male mates likely benefits queen productivity, highlighting the role colony structure plays in the fitness of individual queens within O. chelifer colonies. Our findings did not support the remaining hypotheses. This work illuminates the role of social forms in evolutionary processes in ants, making way for similar studies in different social insects and contributes to a better understanding of the reproductive traits of trap-jaw ants.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

These analyses use genome-wide patterns of variation to provide an average picture of genetic structure and relatedness. However, evolutionary processes result in different patterns of relationship among samples in local genomic regions as compared to the genome-wide aggregate. Recently, these local patterns of relatedness have been used to identify regions under selection and inverted segments. Here, we propose a unifying method to dissect these local deviations in genetic relatedness. Our method, Local Decomposition and Similarity to All Regions (LODESTAR), uses Procrustes Analysis to assess the similarity between local MDS results computed using pairwise allele sharing distances or a set of user-defined points. Given two sets of points, Procrustes Analysis computes the optimal rotation and scaling that fits one set of points onto the other, while maintaining the relative relationship between points within both sets. We use the Procrustes statistic to measure the similarity between the two sets of points. We show how this method can be used to explore local relatedness patterns that mirror sampling geography or population stratification by performing Procrustes analysis between local relatedness plots and coordinates representing sampling geography or between local relatedness plots and the genome-wide relatedness plot, respectively. In addition, we show how the variance of samples in lower-dimensional space can capture regions lacking population structure and inverted segments.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Specifically, we examine a three-habitat multilocus model in which each allele is favored in habitat 1, disfavored in habitat 3, and the selection pressure in the intermediate habitat may be different across loci. Employing the diffusion and fixed state approximations under the assumption of linkage equilibrium, we investigate conditions for the persistence of a polymorphism. We derive analytical thresholds for such persistence, which reveal scaling for the model parameters, local deme size (N), migration rate (m), selection pressure (si) and the proportion, (i) of each habitat. We show that under the assumption of infinitely many islands and selective neutrality in the intermediate habitat, the size of the intermediate habitat does not affect the maintenance of polymorphism. With symmetric selection pressure (s1=s3=s) in habitats 1 and 3, the system can be fully characterized by the product Ns, the product Nm, and a parameter {beta}, defined as the ratio of the size of habitat 1 (favoring the allele) to habitat 3 (where the allele is disfavored). We find that the range of polymorphism widens as gene flow between demes decreases and the symmetry of habitats increases ({beta} approaches 1). In the final section, we explore the effect of drift on the critical migration threshold as well as the effect of symmetry between selection. We demonstrate that genetic drift considerably lowers the critical migration threshold required for the maintenance of polymorphism. Furthermore, when each island is small but there are (infinitely) many of them, relatively low levels of gene flow can have a large impact in preventing genetic differentiation in a fragmented population.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Methods: We used a short-term heatwave treatment in controlled growth chamber environments to study evolutionary responses in Mimulus cardinalis populations to a recent repeated extreme heat event. Individuals from before (ancestors) and after (descendants) this extreme heat event were resurrected from seeds harvested from six populations across the range of M. cardinalis, and their physiological, performance, and functional responses (stomatal conductance, leaf temperature difference, photosystem II efficiency, relative growth rate, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content) to the heatwave treatment were assessed. Key Results: Our results allow for two main conclusions: 1) plants responded favorably to the heatwave treatment in terms of their overall performance and the magnitude of response was generally greatest among trailing-edge populations, and 2) despite some evidence of divergent evolutionary responses among regions to the recent natural extreme heat event, we did not find adaptive evolution that affected how M. cardinalis populations responded to the heatwave treatment. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that many M. cardinalis populations may be residing in natural environments that are below their optimum average temperature, indicating that M. cardinalis populations could exhibit resiliency to future warming. However, limited evolutionary responses in M. cardinalis to the recent extreme heatwave could still indicate that there is potential for future vulnerability to extreme climate events of increased intensity, frequency, and duration in the future.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

We isolated 315 clones from different time points of six independent experiments and characterized changes in genome sequences, bacterial fitness, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to 14 antibiotics. Resistance evolution under ampicillin and cefotaxime was driven by mutations in the ftsI gene, encoding the penicillin-binding protein 3.

Bacterial fitness assessments revealed trade-offs between resistance-associated mutations and growth, though no systematic correlation of MIC increase and growth deficit was detected. Over 50% of the mutants became more susceptible to aminoglycosides, clarithromycin, and colistin, while some mutation patterns resulted in cross-resistance to meropenem and fluoroquinolones.

Here, we investigate this question by engineering synthetic OLGs using state-of-the-art generative models. To evaluate the approach, we first design overlapped sequences targeting two different protein families. We then encode distinct highly ordered de novo protein structures and observe surprisingly high in silico and experimental success rates. This demonstrates that the overlap constraints under the structure of the standard genetic code do not significantly restrict simultaneous accommodation of well defined 3D folds in alternative reading frames. Our work suggests that OLG sequences may be frequently accessible in nature and could be readily exploited to compress and constrain synthetic genetic circuits.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is most susceptible to injury which leads to deficits in executive function, social behaviors, and cognitive flexibility. Prior research has shown a significant role of the oxytocin (OXT) system in the modulation of social behaviors, and that intranasal OXT (IN-OXT) is potentially neuroprotective. Therefore, we believe IN-OXT could improve behavioral deficits caused by a PFC injury. Methods: Animals received a single midline cortical contusion bilaterally damaging the medial PFC (mPFC) and immediately given a single dose of IN-OXT, placebo, or no treatment. Animals were assessed using behavioral and histological measures. Results: The results indicated that IN-OXT in jTBI animals mildly improved spatial learning but did not improve spatial memory. Additionally, TBI increased social dominance behavior, but IN-OXT did not mitigate those behaviors. IN-OXT did not alleviate neuroinflammation but did elevate OXT receptors and OXT peptide levels. Furthermore, TBI decreased OXT in the SON of the hypothalamus, and IN-OXT returned OXT levels in this region to normal. Discussion: These results show that IN-OXT increases OXT levels in the brain via pathways originating in the SON and improved spatial learning.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

To improve signal-to-noise ratio and coverage, fetal brain MRI often uses thick-slice scanning to reduce motion artifacts and ensure image quality for single slices. Reconstructing 3D MR volumes from multiple motion-corrupted stacks of 2D slices has shown promise in imaging of moving subjects like fetal MRI. However, raw scans acquired with varying slice thicknesses present substantial disparities in quality when retrospectively reconstructed into isotropic high-resolution volumes (e.g. 0.8 mm slice thickness). In particular, thick-slice acquisitions (e.g. 5-6 mm) tend to yield suboptimal reconstruction results compared to thin-slice scans (e.g. 2-3 mm), often exhibiting residual noise, interpolation-induced artifacts, and inter-slice structural discontinuities. This challenge has highlighted the need to further reduce noise caused by reconstruction errors when the reconstructed volumes are used for downstream tasks. With the success of neural networks in computer vision, deep learning methods based on architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved outstanding performance in single-image denoising. Nevertheless, CNN-based methods still heavily rely on large-scale datasets comprising noisy-clean image pairs. Although unsupervised GAN variants such as CycleGAN have been developed to mitigate this dependency, the inherent variability of GAN-generated outputs often results in tiny anatomical distortions, significantly limiting the applicability of GAN-based methods. While several approaches have introduced regularizations to address this issue, they largely focus on denoising individual slices, overlooking inter-slice structural inconsistencies that arise from treating slices independently. In this work, we propose Pseudo-Warping Field Guided Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Network (PW-GAN), which formulates post-reconstruction optimization as an unpaired style transfer problem between low-quality and high-quality MRI domains. Moreover, by incorporating a pseudo-deformation field module based on optical flow estimation, our method significantly enhances inter-slice continuity in the reconstructed volumes while effectively suppressing residual noise and interpolation artifacts introduced during the reconstruction process. Evaluations on both simulated and in vivo data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unsupervised models and achieves performance on par with several state-of-the-art supervised methods.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Early studies of such stimuli involving frequency-modulated sweeps revealed that neurons in the primary auditory cortex of a variety of mammals show differences in firing rates depending on either the direction of the sweep and/or the sweep velocity. Psychophysical studies have also shown that the perception of such time-varying stimulus parameters is quite acute, underscoring the importance of such signals in normal acoustic perception. Surprisingly, the responses of auditory neurons in alert primates has been little studied, and we have limited information relating neural activity to the perception of these signals. In this study, we investigated the neural discriminability of sweep direction and velocity for frequency-modulated sweeps presented to alert rhesus macaque monkeys in both core and belt auditory cortical areas. We quantified how well these information-bearing parameters were encoded using spike train pattern discriminators, and compared decoder performance when neural responses were restricted to temporal patterns or firing rates. Decoding accuracy for firing rate alone exceeded chance, and rate-normalized, spike-timing information was essentially equivalent to the complete firing pattern. Although most belt areas showed small decreases in decoding accuracy relative to the primary field, all fields encoded and represented sweeps similarly. Thus, there was little evidence of hierarchical processing between core and belt fields for these stimuli, indicating that frequency modulation sweep direction and velocity are not specifically extracted in the early auditory cortical hierarchy.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Most mouse hepatocytes are tetraploid (4n), which can exist as either mononucleated (1x4n) or binucleated (2x2n) cells. Despite this distinction, these two cell types have traditionally been grouped and studied as a single population. One likely reason for this is that conventional ploidy-sorting methods classify hepatocytes based solely on total DNA content, without distinguishing between mononucleated and binucleated states. In this study, we developed a novel flow cytometry strategy to distinguish and isolate 1x4n and 2x2n hepatocytes. Our approach leverages Hoechst-Area to assess total ploidy and Hoechst-Height to differentiate mononucleated and binucleated hepatocytes. Transcriptome analysis comparing these two populations revealed that 1x4n hepatocytes exhibit a broader and more metabolically active gene expression profile. Importantly, this enhanced metabolic activity was independent of liver zonation, a well-known driver of metabolic heterogeneity in hepatocytes.

The development of hypoimmunogenic, universal cells that could be transplanted to any recipient without requiring a matching donor, could significantly enhance their therapeutic potential and accelerate clinical translation. To create off-the-shelf hypoimmunogenic cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete B2M (HLA class I) and CIITA (master regulator of HLA class II). Double-knockout (DKO) iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) evaded T cell-mediated immune rejection in vitro and after grafting into the injured spinal cord of athymic rats and humanized mice. However, loss of HLA class I heightened susceptibility to host natural killer (NK) cell attack, limiting graft survival. To counter this negative effect, we engineered DKO NPCs to overexpress macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), an NK cell checkpoint ligand. MIF expression markedly reduced NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and improved long-term engraftment and integration of NPCs in the animal models for spinal cord injury. These findings demonstrate that MIF overexpression, combined with concurrent B2M and CIITA deletion, generates hiPSC neural derivatives that escape both T- and NK-cell surveillance.

While these analyses often rely on phylogenetic trees, increasing evidence suggests that non-treelike evolutionary events, such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer, are prevalent in the evolutionary histories of many species, and in such cases, tree-based models are insufficient. Phylogenetic networks can capture such complex evolutionary histories, but current methods for accurately inferring them lack scalability. For instance, state-of-the-art model-based approaches are limited to around 30 taxa. Implicit network inference methods like NeighborNet and Consensus Networks are fast but lack biological interpretability. Here, we introduce a novel method called InPhyNet that merges a set of non-overlapping, independently inferred networks into a unified topology, achieving linear scalability while maintaining high accuracy under the multispecies network coalescent model. Our simulations show that InPhyNet matches the accuracy of SNaQ on datasets with 30 taxa while drastically decreasing the overall network inference time. InPhyNet is also more accurate than implicit network methods on large datasets while maintaining computational feasibility. Re-analyzing a phylogeny of 1,158 land plants with InPhyNet, we recover known reticulate events and provide evidence for the controversial placement of Order Gnetales within gymnosperms.

In this study, we tested for asymmetric reinforcement between morphs in the polymorphic damselflies Ischnura elegans and Ischnura graellsii, in which female morphs exhibit alternative reproductive strategies and males show a preference for the gynochrome morph. These species have formed two independent hybrid zones where reinforcement has strengthened a mechanical barrier and reproductive character displacement has shaped mating-related structures. We compared the strength of five reproductive barriers between female morphs to assess the interplay between female-limited color polymorphism and reinforcement. We detected asymmetric reinforcement in premating and postmating barriers between morphs in both hybrid zones, likely driven by their different reproductive strategies. Additionally, we observed weakening of oviposition and fertility barriers probably associated with gene flow and purging of incompatibilities.

Culturing a dysbiotic cervico-vaginal microbiome on-chip increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in patients with preterm labor and enhanced production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade stromal extracellular matrix (ECM). Perfusion with inflammatory cytokines at clinically relevant concentrations altered cervical mucus composition, upregulated prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 expression, increased MMP secretion, and reduced collagen production, which together drive dissolution of the stromal ECM and promote cervical ripening. Addition of circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) amplified these effects.

We compared a no-harvest baseline, a business-as-usual regime guided by economic criteria, and a risk informed strategy that prioritizes harvesting of the most susceptible stands. Across two climate trajectories, we found that susceptibility-guided harvesting significantly reduced average forest susceptibility and fragmented high-risk areas, particularly in southern Norway. However, our results also reveal limitations to this approach: even with aggressive susceptibility-guided harvesting, long-term risk reductions plateau due to the homogenizing effects of even-aged forestry. Spatial connectivity analysis using electrical circuit theory further showed that susceptibility-guided harvesting disrupted landscape continuity among high-risk patches, suggesting a potential to constrain outbreak spread.

This could enhance multi-tasking efficiency by facilitating cohesion with group mates while monitoring for threats. In our study, we examined visual lateralisation of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) tested either alone or in groups, in either the presence or absence of a live predator, the blue acara (Andinoacara pulcher). We consistently observed low levels of visual lateralisation across all treatments. Contrary to our expectations, however, guppies exhibited significantly higher absolute lateralisation when tested alone in the absence of the predator compared to the other treatments. Moreover, a significant left-eye bias was observed when the predator was present, and the fish showed a right-eye bias when the predator was absent. Use of a repeated measures design and assessing individual and group ID as random effects provided evidence that both relative and absolute laterality were repeatable at the group level, but there was limited evidence for repeatability at the level of the individuals. This repeatability in lateralisation when tested as a group, but not when individual fish composing these groups were tested alone, suggests social conformity in lateralisation.

Here, we present a computational method that takes advantage of modern high-throughput fitness measurements to learn a map from high-dimensional fitness profiles to a low-dimensional latent space in a geometry-informed manner. We demonstrate that our approach using a Riemannian Hamiltonian Variational Autoencoder (RHVAE) outperforms traditional linear dimensionality reduction techniques by capturing the nonlinear structure of the phenotype-fitness map. When applied to simulated adaptive dynamics, we show that the learned latent space retains information about the underlying adaptive phenotypic space and accurately reconstructs complex fitness landscapes. We then apply this method to a dataset of high-throughput fitness measurements of E. coli under different antibiotic pressures and demonstrate superior predictive power for out-of-sample data compared to linear approaches. Our work provides a data-driven implementation of Fisher's geometric model of adaptation, transforming it from a theoretical framework into an empirically grounded approach for understanding evolutionary dynamics using modern deep learning methods.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

T.-S.; Mullis, M.", "abstract": "The mechanical resilience of the aortic wall hinges on the organisation of its concentric elastic laminae, yet histological evaluation of these fibers remains largely qualitative and observer-dependent. We present a fully automated, stain-aware pipeline that transforms Verhoeff-Van Gieson (VVG) whole-slide images of mouse aortae into reproducible, quantitative maps of elastic-fiber architecture. Leveraging optical-density deconvolution to disentangle elastin from collagen, the workflow couples multi-resolution processing with graph-based skeletonisation to preserve gigapixel detail while scaling efficiently. It returns pixel-level measurements of fiber thickness, tortuosity, lamina count and network complexity, together with validation snapshots for transparent quality control. By eliminating observer bias and delivering high-throughput morphometry, our framework enables powered genotype-phenotype screens in genetically diverse mouse populations and provides objective read-outs for interventions aimed at preserving matrix integrity. The modular codebase is open-source, readily extendable to other elastin-rich tissues or stains, and forms a bridge between qualitative microscopy and biomechanical phenotyping-setting the stage for large-scale, data-driven exploration of vascular structure-function relationships.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

P.; Benson, D.; Watts, J.; Velasque, M.; Warden, A.; Morgan, M.", "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) predict emergent phenotypes by modeling the metabolic networks encoded in genomes. While GEMs have significantly advanced systems biology, metabolic engineering, biomedicine, and environmental science, they require extensive time and resources for manual curation, which can limit their utility in rapidly evolving research landscapes. Recent findings suggest that manually curated reactions can sometimes reduce prediction accuracy, indicating that integrating additional biologically grounded constraints may better capture emergent phenotypes. One promising approach is the incorporation of enzyme allocation constraints, which has been shown to enhance the predictive accuracy in metabolic models. Enzymatically constrained GEMs (ecGEMs) rely on enzyme turnover rates (kcat) and protein molecular weights (MWs) to account for intracellular resource limitations by introducing an enzyme pool variable and assigning costs to reactions, thereby simulating enzymatic resource constraints. Tools such as GECKO, AutoPACMEN, and ECMpy provide computational pipelines for ecGEM generation. However, these pipelines are often limited by their reliance on experimentally measured kcat values or deep learning-predicted values, such as those generated by DLKcat, which face challenges in predicting kinetics for enzymes dissimilar to their training data. Additionally, these methods frequently require extensive manual curation of kcat values based on empirical data, a time-intensive process that hampers scalability and applicability to non-model organisms. To address these limitations, we introduce EMMAi (Enzyme-constrained Metabolic Models with AI), a pipeline that fully automates the incorporation of enzyme constraints into GEMs. Unlike existing pipelines, EMMAi exclusively utilizes kcat values predicted by UniKP, an AI framework with improved accuracy over DLKcat, particularly for enzymes not present in training datasets. UniKP achieves a 13% improvement in correlation for unseen enzymes, enabling EMMAi to deliver ecGEMs with enhanced prediction accuracy without manual curation requirements. We evaluated EMMAi by applying it to three GEMs: two manually curated models, iJO1366 (Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655) and iMO1056 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1), and one draft GEM constructed and gap-filled using CarveMe. EMMAi-generated ecGEMs showed an average Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) improvement of 0.27 for manually curated GEMs when compared to predicted and experimentally measured growth rates and Biolog readings. Notably, for the draft GEM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, the PCC improved dramatically from -0.3 to 0.6. EMMAi demonstrates that automating the integration of enzyme allocation constraints using AI-predicted kinetic parameters significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of GEMs, even in the absence of manual curation. These results underscore EMMAi's potential as a scalable, efficient, and accurate tool for advancing GEM-based research in systems biology, metabolic engineering, and beyond.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Clinical trials of the photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis PRIMA demonstrated feasibility of prosthetic central vision with resolution matching its 100 m pixel size. To improve prosthetic acuity further, pixel size should be decreased. However, there are multiple challenges, one of which is related to accommodating a compact shunt resistor within each pixel that discharges the electrodes between stimulation pulses and helps increase the contrast of the electric field pattern. Unfortunately, standard materials used in integrated circuit resistors do not match the resistivity required for small photovoltaic pixels. Therefore, we used a novel material - doped amorphous silicon (a-Si) and integrated it into photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes down to 20 m. Approach. To fit within a few m2 area of the pixels and provide resistance in the M{Omega} range, the material should have sheet resistance of a few hundred k{Omega}/sq, which translates to resistivity of a few {Omega}*cm. The a-Si layer was deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and its resistivity was adjusted by PH3 doping before encapsulating the resistors between SiO2 and SiC for stability in-vivo. Main Results. High-resolution retinal implants with integrated shunt resistors were fabricated with values ranging from 0.75 to 4 M{Omega} on top of the photovoltaic pixels of 55, 40, 30 and 20 m in size. Photoresponsivity with all pixel sizes was approximately 0.53 A/W, as high as in the arrays with no shunt resistor. The shunts shortened electrodes discharge time, with the average electric potential in electrolyte decreasing by only 21-31% when repetition rate increased from 2 to 30 Hz, as opposed to a 54-55% decrease without a shunt. Similarly, contrast of a Landolt C pattern increased from 16-22% with no shunt to 22-34% with a shunt. Further improvement in contrast is expected with pillar electrodes and local returns within each pixel. Significance. Miniature shunt resistors in a MOhm range can be fabricated from doped a-Si in a process compatible with manufacturing of photovoltaic arrays. The shunt resistors improved current injection and spatial contrast at video frame rates, without compromising the photoresponsivity. These advances are critical for scaling pixel sizes below 100 m to improve visual acuity of prosthetic vision.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Z.; Narayanan, S. N.; Stagliano, L. M.; Huynh, P. Q.; Sundaram, S.; Mackey, E. J.; Miller, C. T.; Square, T. A.", "abstract": "Organ initiation is often driven by extracellular signals that activate precursor cells competent to receive and respond to the signal, yet little is known about how dynamic competency is in space and time during development. Teeth are excellent organs to study organ initiation competency because they can be activated with the addition of a single signaling ligand, Ectodysplasin (Eda). Eda, a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) ligand, is a critical regulator of ectodermal organ development, including teeth, acting through TNF receptors, like Edar, to activate NF-{kappa}B signaling in tooth precursor cells. While Eda is both necessary for normal tooth formation and sufficient for ectopic tooth formation, the spatial and temporal dynamics of competency for ectopic tooth initiation and maintenance remains unknown. To investigate the role of Eda in tooth specification, we generated transgenic sticklebacks and zebrafish with heat shock-inducible Eda overexpression. We find that stickleback Eda can drive de novo tooth formation in at least eight distinct oropharyngeal and cranial domains. Both zebrafish and stickleback exhibit maximal responsiveness to Eda overexpression during the critical window of pioneer tooth initiation, highlighting that the precursors of ectopic pharyngeal teeth likely follow a similar developmental trajectory as endogenous tooth precursors. Furthermore, we observe that some induced dental fields often undergo tooth regeneration to maintain themselves, allowing them to persist for months after the cessation of transgene activation. Finally, analysis of TNF receptor expression in sticklebacks reveals that ectopic tooth formation in the pharynx correlates with Edar and Troy expression, while in the region where teeth can form on the face, only Troy expression was detected, providing a possible molecular mechanism of competency involving spatially restricted receptor expression. These findings underscore the latent developmental potential, i.e. competency, of the vertebrate dentition and provide insights into organ competency during embryonic and post-embryonic development.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Early maternal treatment with valaciclovir has been shown to reduce fetal infection. However, newer, more potent anti-CMV medications such as letermovir and maribavir are not routinely used in pregnancy due to limited safety data. This study aimed to assess the effect of aciclovir (the active metabolite of valaciclovir), letermovir, and maribavir on cell viability, functionality, and key cell signalling pathways in first-trimester human placental tissue. First-trimester placental tissue was obtained from individuals undergoing surgical abortion for psychosocial indications at 9-13 weeks of gestation. The effect of anti-CMV medications on primary cytotrophoblast cell survival was measured using a standard cell viability assay. The effects of anti-CMV medication exposure on Wnt and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signalling pathways were evaluated in placental explant cultures. Their impact on cellular proliferation and migration was assessed using placental outgrowth cultures. Exposure to physiological or supraphysiological levels of aciclovir, letermovir, or maribavir for 48 hours did not significantly alter cytotrophoblast cell viability compared to vehicle-treated controls. Aciclovir did not significantly impact Wnt and EMT signalling gene expression in first-trimester placental explants; however, letermovir and maribavir induced significant gene dysregulation. None of the three anti-CMV medications altered first-trimester trophoblast proliferation or migration. These results provide reassuring data supporting the safety of maternal valaciclovir therapy in the first trimester.

P.; Kim, T.; Issadore, D. A.; Meaney, D. F.", "abstract": "There is a critical unmet need for concussion biomarkers for injury prognosis and cognitive recovery. Existing traumatic brain injury (TBI) biomarkers are largely focused on acute cellular damage and reactivity, rather than the cellular repair mechanisms that contribute to differential concussion outcomes. Neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are an emerging alternative to traditional protein biomarkers, providing a brain-specific molecular signature that can inform mechanistic insights and subsequent therapeutic intervention. Although neuroinflammation plays a key role in injury repair and cognitive recovery, its influence on neuronal EV signatures is unknown. In this work, we examine the role of inflammation in subacute neuronal EV biomarkers for differential concussion recovery in male mice. In particular, we identify general diagnostic biomarkers for concussion using miRNAs from neuronal EVs in blood serum, and then subtyped concussion based on prior injury history. Using PLX5622 to diminish the brain's inflammatory response, we find that acute inflammation significantly contributes to differential cognitive recovery post-concussion and can enhance or impede recovery based on injury history. Furthermore, we find that removing microglia prior to injury eliminates diagnostic biomarkers of concussion. Finally, we identify a general panel of EV-derived miRNA biomarkers associated with cognitive recovery across all experimental conditions. Together, we not only identify putative biomarkers for post-acute concussion diagnosis, injury history, and cognitive recovery, but also define a novel role for neuron-derived EVs in indirectly surveilling brain inflammation. Broadly, these findings could inform efforts to subtype concussion patients and identify more precise recovery profiles for individual concussion patients.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis revealed diverse malignant and immune cell populations, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) emerging as the primary source of SPP1 (osteopontin), a glycoprotein that suppresses T cell activation through CD44 binding. Cell-cell communication analysis identified the SPP1-CD44 axis as a dominant immunosuppressive pathway in the tumor microenvironment. Despite extensive transcription factor screening, no strong regulators of SPP1 were identified, suggesting regulation occurs via alternative mechanisms. To assess structural features of SPP1, replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations were performed, revealing that the CD44-binding domain is conformationally stable. Phosphorylation at Ser169, a conserved site, further stabilized this region, suggesting a potential mechanism for enhanced CD44 interaction. To disrupt this axis, among 2,500 variants of anti-SPP1 23C3 antibody, a lead candidate variant (23C3-v1) with improved SPP1 binding affinity and minimal sequence divergence was identified.

Our analysis identified seven major cell types across 11 brain regions and further characterized glial subtypes microglia and astrocytes revealing subtype-specific chromatin accessibility changes in 5xFAD mice relative to controls. These alterations were associated with AD-related pathways, including neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation, and synaptic dysfunction and neuronal signaling in microglia, as well as lysosomal and proteasomal activity, lipoprotein metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes. We also characterized cell-type-specific enrichments of motifs and transcription factors, including enrichment of Bcl11a in microglia. Furthermore, we linked chromatin accessibility changes in 5xFAD mice to human AD risk genes, highlighting altered epigenetic signatures in genes such as Trem2. Supporting the spatial ATAC-seq findings, flow cytometry validated a selective increase in VISTA (encoded by Vsir) protein expression in 5xFAD microglia, supporting the spatial ATAC-seq findings and indicating a shift toward a pro-inflammatory, disease-associated microglial (DAM-like) phenotype.

Here, the Human Urogenital Microbiome (HUGMi) workflow is introduced, wherein a manually curated, niche-specific, 16S rRNA database is integrated with a novel hybrid classification algorithm to enhance amplicon-based species-level taxonomic resolution in urogenital microbiome investigations. The HUGMi database is curated through rigorous quality assessment of sequences, nomenclature correction of taxonomies and meticulous selection of bacterial species biologically significant to the human urogenital region. Quantitative evaluation of taxonomic assignment with mock communities demonstrates that HUGMi consistently achieved superior accuracy compared to conventional databases, with statistically significant improvement in F1 scores. Comparative analyses across three sets of biological data also reveal a robust and versatile performance, with both QIIME2 BLAST and sklearn-based taxonomic classifiers and with varied 16S regions. Following these outcomes the HUGMi hybrid classifier was developed that combines the specificity of BLAST-based methods with the probabilistic framework of learning-based classifiers. This approach enabled superior species-level identification through varying confidence thresholds. In contrast to the limited number of species identified in real-time studies, the integrated outcome of the HUGMi database and hybrid classifier, not just replicated the original results but simultaneously revealed a spectrum of previously unidentified species. Despite its crucial role in human health, the urogenital microbiome is comparatively understudied with respect to other body sites.

We previously identified Argonaute 1 (AGO1)--a canonical component of the RNA-induced silencing complex--as a regulator of EC function in angiogenesis and metabolism. In this study, we uncover a previously unrecognized, non-canonical role of nuclear AGO1 in ECs as a transcriptional coactivator of NF-{kappa}B, and demonstrate that EC-specific AGO1 inhibition simultaneously improves lipid metabolism, liver function, and vascular inflammation, thereby attenuating atherosclerosis. METHODS: EC-conditional AGO1 knockout (EC-AGO1-KO) and wildtype mice were subjected to pro-atherosclerotic models induced by AAV9-PCSK9 and a western diet, or carotid artery ligation. Metabolic and vascular phenotyping and gene expression analyses were performed. In human liver sinusoidal ECs (HLSECs) and human aortic ECs (HAECs), AGO1 was knocked down using antisense oligos (ASO), followed by assays for inflammatory responses (qPCR, RNA-seq, ELISA, and monocyte adhesion). Mechanistic studies included Cut&Tag sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and EC-hepatocyte co-cultures. Therapeutic effect of AGO1 inhibition was assessed using lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-delivered ASO in mice. RESULTS: EC-AGO1-KO mice exhibited significantly improved plasma lipid profiles, reduced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, and decreased aortic atherosclerotic burden. AGO1 knockdown in ECs dampened inflammatory responses and monocyte recruitment and enhanced hepatocyte lipid metabolism via paracrine signaling. Mechanistically, nuclear AGO1 interacted with NF-{kappa}B p65 to enhance transcription of pro-inflammatory genes including ICAM1, THBS1. LNP-delivered AGO1-ASO improved hyperlipidemia, liver function, and atherosclerosis without evident hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial AGO1 promotes vascular inflammation and liver dysfunction through a non-canonical role as an NF-{kappa}B coactivator. Its inhibition provides dual benefits--ameliorating lipid dysregulation and suppressing vascular inflammation--highlighting EC-AGO1 as a promising therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and cardiometabolic diseases.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

While many meta-analysis methods and tools have been developed for transcriptomic data, each manifests certain limitations, typically relying on either P-value combination or effect size integration alone. To address these limitations, we introduce AWmeta, a novel method for transcriptomic meta-analysis, which, for the first time, integrates the advantages of transcriptomic meta-analysis P-value and effect size methods, resulting in performance enhancement. By leveraging 35 transcriptomic datasets from Parkinson's and Crohn's disease, encompassing diverse tissue types, AWmeta exerts superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, including REM (Random Effect Model), across a range of key metrics. Specifically, AWmeta provides highly reliable differentially expressed genes (DEG) via accurate DEG discrimination in real and simulated data. Moreover, AWmeta results in gene difference quantification converging closer to theoretical baselines at both gene- and study-level compared to independent studies and REM. Importantly, AWmeta requires only a small sample size of independent studies to achieve substantial gene difference quantification effects, aiding in reducing experimental costs. We also observed that AWmeta requires fewer DEGs from integrated independent studies to achieve significant gene difference quantification effects, easing experimental operation and reducing researcher workload. While maintaining reliable differential gene quantification, AWmeta demonstrates robust performance against external interference and internal defects. In addition, AWmeta generates gene difference quantification results that offer more biologically meaningful insights than those from original independent studies and REM. Systematic evaluation demonstrates that AWmeta outperforms existing methods by achieving superior convergence, stability, and robustness with smaller sample size and fewer DEGs. Overall, AWmeta serves as a powerful and effective tool for transcriptomic meta-analysis.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that weakly adhered giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) can be osmotically deflated to reduced volumes as low as 0.1, similar to what is found in flattened, disc-shaped organelles such as Golgi cisternae and ER sheets. Using shape analysis with the spontaneous curvature model, we determine mechanical parameters including adhesion strength, membrane tension, and pressure of individual vesicles. We find that the rate of shape flattening during deflation is governed by a normalized adhesion strength that combines vesicle size, adhesion energy, and bending rigidity. For highly flattened disc-like vesicles, we identify a geometric relationship that allows the adhesion strength to be estimated solely from the vesicle's aspect ratio, size, and bending rigidity. These results provide a quantitative experimental platform for bottom-up studies of membrane shaping mechanisms and shape-dependent phenomena, such as curvature-mediated protein sorting.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

We present context-dependent identification of spatial motifs (CISM), a two-step method to identify local cell structures associated with a disease state in single cell spatial data. First, for each tissue, CISM enumerates structures of enriched reoccurring multicellular patterns that define modular 'motifs' in the multicellular network. Second, discriminative motifs are selected according to the context - their presence in patients at different clinical disease states. By applying CISM, we show that modular structures composed of as little as 3-5 cells and their relative spatial arrangement can encode differences in clinical disease states in cohorts of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and melanoma patients. Machine learning validation indicated that discriminative motifs outperform state-of-the-art methods for disease state prediction while enabling interpretation of which interactions in what spatial context are associated with these predictions.

(marijuana, hemp) is a dioecious angiosperm species currently evolving sex chromosomes. Genetic mechanisms, primarily controlled by an XY chromosome system, appear to dictate sex expression in C. sativa. However, sexual expression is also governed by the interplay of hormone regulatory gene networks, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Within the species, some populations exhibit dioecy, monoecy, or a gradient of both. Dioecious individuals produce exclusively male or female flowers, while monoecious plants bear both male and female flowers. However, through interruption of phytohormone signal transduction via abiotic stressors, male and female Cannabis are able to produce flowers of the opposite sex. This mechanism appears to be mediated via long-range signaling cascades enabling alternative cell wall embryo-genesis programming. When the pollen produced by these masculinized XX (genetically female) plants is applied for breeding, the seeds produced all lack a Y chromosome, and are thus considered feminized seeds. Previous transcriptomic analysis have identified genes associated with masculinization through the application of phytohormone signal disruption using silver thiosulfate treatment. We used Jack and Nota (Network Ontology Transcript Annotation), tools developed by SciAnno Mosaics and CU Boulder, to analyze transcriptomic data from C. sativa treated with colloidal silver to induce masculinization. Jack streamlined differential gene expression analysis and functional annotation of the resulting transcripts. Using Nota's multilayer network analysis (random walk with restart), we identified candidate sex-determining genes. Nota and Jack operate on the principle of building a reference-free biology, enabling discovery and annotation of gene-trait associations without relying on pre-existing genomic references. Our findings highlight Nota's power to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits, particularly in systems like C. sativa where sex determination is influenced by multiple factors.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

However, its role in defending against self-view threat, common in social interactions and critical to well-being, remains unclear. This study investigates the neural mechanisms through which vasopressin modulates self-protective responses to spontaneous social comparison. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled neuroimaging experiment, participants rated their satisfaction with social evaluations and monetary outcomes assigned to a stranger, friend, or themselves. Compared to placebo, vasopressin selectively intensified contrastive emotional responses to social evaluations of the stranger, decreasing satisfaction with positive evaluations and increasing satisfaction with negative evaluations, relative to those of the self or friend. At the neural level, vasopressin reduced the distinctions between the stranger and the self/friend in the medial prefrontal cortex activity, multivariate response patterns, and functional connectivity with the temporoparietal junction and precuneus, with this effect being especially pronounced among socially dominant individuals. These converging neuroimaging findings support the hypothesis that vasopressin alters the neural representation of the stranger, shifting it from a socially irrelevant figure under placebo to a psychologically salient competitor, thereby triggering self-protective emotional processes. These findings elucidate novel neuropsychological mechanisms through which vasopressin amplifies emotional defense against social threats and offer insights into potential clinical applications for psychiatric conditions characterized by impaired self-protection.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Healthy adults stood wearing a VR headset that presented two interleaved adaptive staircases of virtual sinusoidal pitch rotation about the ankle axis. In separate conditions of randomly ordered blocks, subjects were asked to indicate (yes/no) if the room moved (regardless of perceived postural sway) or if their postural sway increased (regardless of perceived room motion). Head sway area was measured by tracking movement of the VR headset. Binary response data were fit with psychometric curves to determine points of subjective equality (PSEs) for room motion and postural sway. PSEs were compared between conditions. Effects of motion perception (binary responses) on head sway area before, during, and after visual stimulation were examined. The mean PSE for room motion (0.42 degrees) was significantly lower than for postural sway (2.02 degrees) [t(1,18) = 4.4714, p = 0.00029].

We can use the relationship between stimulus area and this \"threshold\" contrast to study the detection process. Contrast signals combine linearly over short distances, as if summed within the receptive fields that define the inputs to early visual neurons. Beyond this range, the effects of area summation decrease. We set out to find whether the relationship between stimulus area and threshold is the same across the visual field. We measured thresholds for detecting \"tiger tail\" strips of grating (that grow orthogonal to the major axis of those presumed early receptive fields) in the fovea, parafovea (3 deg), and periphery (10.5 deg). The interpretation of previous studies taking similar approaches has been complicated by the variation in local contrast sensitivity across the visual field. In our study, we have mapped a detailed \"Witch Hat\" attenuation surface of this inhomogeneity for our three participants. We used this both in our model to account for the results, as well as to generate \"compensated\" stimuli that are equally detectable at each location within the stimulus extent. Our results follow a common fourth root summation rule in the fovea, parafovea, and periphery. Our \"noisy energy\" model predicts this behaviour through a combination of: i) the Witch Hat surface, ii) linear filtering by receptive fields that mimic those of V1 simple cells, iii) square-law contrast transduction, and iv) the application of an internal template that devotes the participant's attention to the extent of the stimulus. Fitting this model with one global sensitivity parameter (per participant) accounts for the foveal and parafoveal data (56 thresholds), with one further parameter allowing us to also model the periphery (84 thresholds).", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Given evidence of increased intestinal permeability in ALS, we investigated its link to neuroinflammation and oxysterol alterations in SOD1G93A rats. Methods: Oxysterols were quantified in plasma and spinal cord from presymptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G93A rats and age-matched controls via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Circulating LBP, a marker of intestinal permeability, was quantified via ELISA. Results: Oxysterols involved in bile acid biosynthesis - 7-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH), and 3{beta}-hydroxycholestenoic acid - were increased in the plasma of symptomatic rats. The neuronal oxysterol 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-OH) decreased in the spinal cord but increased in the plasma. In contrast, 27-OH and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH) levels were elevated in both plasma and spinal cord, with 25-OH rising during the presymptomatic stage. Presymptomatic animals also exhibited elevated LBP levels, which strongly correlated with spinal cord 25-OH levels, suggesting a link between systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation in ALS. Conclusion: Oxysterol alterations in plasma and spinal cord suggest compromised blood-spinal cord barrier integrity and early neuroinflammation. Elevated LBP levels indicate increased intestinal permeability and circulating LPS as contributors to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These findings highlight 25-OH and LBP as markers and mediators of gut-brain axis interactions in ALS pathogenesis, particularly in the presymptomatic phase.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Our previous transcriptomic analysis identified an increased hepatic type-1 interferon (IFN-1) response in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected rhesus macaques, including pronounced upregulation of the IFN-1 stimulated gene product MX1. Here, we interrogated the role of different cell types in the IFN-1 response, focusing on macrophage subsets. During the acute phase of SIV infection, the expression of MX1 in liver biopsies was elevated in the resident macrophage Kupffer cells (KCs, CD163+ CD206+) as well as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs, CD163- CD206+). Chronic infection was associated with increased MX1 expression both within KCs and the recruited monocyte-derived macrophages (MdMs, CD163+ CD206-) although the KCs were associated with the highest MX1 expression levels. We explored factors in the liver potentially associated with the macrophage IFN-1 response: 1) SIV DNA load, 2) bacterial DNA load (assessed via SIV DNA and 16S bacterial DNA qPCR, respectively), and 3) acute-phase hepatocyte lipid accumulation (steatosis). Both SIV and bacteria were elevated during chronic infection and directly correlated with MdM frequency. KC frequency did not correlate with SIV load but inversely correlated with bacterial load and also correlated directly with hepatocyte microvesicular steatosis in acute infection. Hepatocytes expressed variable levels of MX1 during acute and chronic infection. Overall, our data identify MdMs, LSECs and KCs as contributors to the heightened expression of MX1 in the liver during SIV infection. KCs express the highest levels of MX1 and therefore represent a potential target to reduce liver inflammation in people with HIV.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

AIDR112H GC B cells had reduced capacity to up-regulate IRF4 to initiate plasma cell differentiation, leading to accumulation of a transitional GC population with reduced GL7 expression. Genetic introduction of a high affinity B cell receptor (BCR) was unable to restore plasma cell differentiation of AIDR112H B cells while ectopic expression of catalytic active AID rescued plasma cell generation. AIDR112H impaired recruitment of AID to the Irf4 promoter/enhancer and disrupted the interaction with Ten-eleven Translocation 2 (TET2). Consequently, DNA demethylation at the Irf4 promoter/enhancer was reduced in AIDR112H GC B cells and impeded high Irf4 expression for transition into plasma cells.

Here, we present the first systematic study investigating the impact of natural single nucleotide variants on antigen recognition by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, both approved and in clinical development. For every antibody analysed, we identified genetic variants within or near the antibody-antigen interface, a subset of which are predicted to disrupt antigen recognition. Experimental studies corroborated the impact of select variants for four different antigens, revealing complete loss of antibody binding in some cases. As a consequence, a human breast cancer cell line overexpressing ErbB2 but engineered to carry the ErbB2P594H variant, was completely resistant to killing even by highly potent clinical antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). These findings suggest that natural variants can confer primary resistance to antibody-based therapies, with critical implications for treatment outcomes, patient management and safety, particularly in the context of potent modalities such as ADCs.

While the ubiquitin-proteasome system is established as the central mediator of myofibrillar protein degradation, the role of autophagy in selective protein turnover remains largely unexplored. To address this, we employed a quantitative, time-resolved analysis of protein synthesis and degradation in C2C12 myotubes undergoing TNF--induced atrophy, using dynamic Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (dynamic SILAC) coupled with LC-MS/MS. Our data challenges the classical view of atrophy as a uniform, degradation-centric process. Instead, we reveal temporally distinct patterns of selective protein turnover, including differential degradation of myofibrillar, ribosomal, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident proteins. Early atrophy is characterized by suppressed short-term protein synthesis, increased ubiquitin-ligase expression, proteasomal activation, and ribosome turnover. In contrast, late atrophy features proteasome-dependent myofibrillar protein degradation, selective synthesis of mitochondrial ribosomes and cytoplasmic ribosome degradation, indicative of metabolic adaptation. Moreover, we identify a temporal shift in autophagic selectivity: from ER homeostasis maintenance to a stress-induced ER-degradation program. Notably, inhibition of autophagy during atrophy leads to accumulation of ER-phagy receptors Tex264 and Calcoco1, implicating ER-phagy as a key contributor to atrophic remodeling, underscoring an underexplored regulatory mechanism in muscle proteostasis. By elucidating the role of autophagy in degradation of the ER, this study opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting proteostasis regulation in inflammation-induced muscle-wasting disorders, ultimately contributing to a more refined understanding of muscle atrophy beyond proteasomal degradation.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

We show in the embryonic lung that the PA arises from an endothelial niche harbored within the vascular plexus, regulating Aplnr+ progenitors that differentiate into arterial endothelial cells (ECs) and Ebf1+ ECs. Instead of directly incorporating into the PA endothelium, these Ebf1+ ECs secrete vasculotrophic signals that organize the proper expansion and arterialization of plexus progenitors with the recruitment of the mesenchymal cells that muscularize and ensheathe the maturing PA. Although essential in development, most Ebf1+ ECs disappear by completion of PA morphogenesis. In adult PAH, the embryonic artery-forming niche is reactivated. The normally quiescent Aplnr+ general capillary stem cells re-enter the cell cycle and regenerate arterial ECs and Ebf1+ ECs. By expressing key vasculotrophic signals including Apelin, Cxcl12/Cxcr4, Notch, and Tgf-b, these Ebf1+ ECs promote angiogenesis, neoarterialization, and neo-muscularization in a maladaptive process echoing their role in development.

Yet, how and when heterochromatin is reconfigured to facilitate changes in cell-fate remains a key open question. Here, we address this by mapping a prevalent heterochromatic feature - genome-lamina interactions - relative to transcription in single-cells during mouse embryogenesis. We find that genome-lamina interactions remain relatively uniform between germ layers following gastrulation but are extensively reconfigured in diverse tissues during later organogenesis. Focusing on limb development, we demonstrate that genome-lamina interactions are selectively released in early multipotent progenitors at key developmental genes and their surrounding regulatory domains. This lamina-release often precedes gene expression at later developmental stages, suggesting it primes regulatory domains for future potential activation. Conversely, lamina-release coincides with chromatin opening at sites of crucial limb transcription factor binding, and so is closely intertwined with the regulatory machinery driving limb formation. Finally, we show that the boundaries of topologically-associated domains (TADs) constrain the spread of lamina-release at a limb gene locus. This ensures independent lamina dynamics between neighbouring domains. Together, our data suggest a previously unrecognised process where genome-lamina interactions are selectively released at regulatory domains to transition loci toward more permissive chromatin states, thereby potentiating cell type specific activation. Our work thus reveals how systematic heterochromatin reorganization links to developmental multipotency, providing mechanistic insights into cell-fate decisions in vivo.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

In this study, we identified fatty acids found on the exterior of eggs laid by female P. papatasi that could be potential oviposition pheromones. We tested the effect of different treatments on 1) the number of eggs laid and 2) the spatial distribution of eggs laid. The treatments included three quantities of eggs (80, 160 and 320), hexane extracts of 160 eggs, 160 eggs after being washed with hexane to remove any pheromones, and three concentrations (1ng, 10ng and 100ng) of synthetic versions of three fatty acids that we identified as being present on egg exteriors. The saturated fatty acids dodecanoic (C12) and tetradecanoic (C14) acid, identified by GC/MS analysis, were abundant in hexane extracts of both eggs and gravid females but were present in only trace amounts in males. Hexadecanoic and hexadecenoic (C16) acids were abundant on eggs, gravid females and males. A negative binomial GLM found that significantly more eggs were oviposited by gravid females in response to 80 eggs (P=0.0255), 160 eggs (P<0.001), 320 eggs (P<0.001) and the hexane extract of 160 eggs (P<0.001). Eggs washed in hexane were not more attractive than a control (P=0.591). The number of eggs laid was increased by all three concentrations of hexadecanoic acid (P<0.001), 10ng and 100ng of tetradecanoic acid (P<0.001), and 1ng and 10ng of dodecanoic acid (P<0.001). The spatial response of oviposition (the proportion of eggs laid on the test vs. control side of the oviposition pot) was weaker than the response of total eggs laid. A beta GLM found that gravid females laid a significantly higher proportion of eggs near 160 eggs (P=0.004) and significantly lower proportion of eggs near 100ng of dodecanoic acid (P=0.016). Bootstrapping and permutation tests also suggested significant attractive effects of 320 eggs, egg extract, and 1ng and 10 ng of hexadecenoic acid. These results suggest that hexadecanoic acid is the oviposition pheromone, of P. papatasi from Tunisia because its presence increases both the number of eggs laid and attracts oviposition over the small spatial scales of the assay.

In this study, dodecanoic acid increased the number of eggs laid but either did not change their spatial distribution or was repulsive at the highest concentration. The observed difference may be related to the different geographical origins of the sand flies used in this study.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

One potential reason for this variability is priority effects, where historical contingency in arrival order affects how symbionts assemble into communities. Focusing on the luminous bacterium (Photobacterium mandapamensis) in the light organ of the sea urchin cardinalfish (Siphamia tubifer), we studied how priority effects might influence bacterial symbiont assembly. In in vitro experiments that used three P. mandapamensis strains isolated from the same individual fish, we found that whichever strain arrived first dominated over the other two strains, indicating strong priority effects. We also found that the strains differed in growth and luminosity, and that the bioluminescence of the three-strain community could not be predicted from individual strain performances. These findings suggest that priority effects can be a major process shaping the composition and function of these symbiotic microbial communities.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Yet, despite their importance for biodiversity and human livelihoods, the TGBs of South Asia, including India, have historically been undervalued, and as result, understudied. Here, we address this gap with the first subcontinental-scale analyses of grass species richness and distribution across the Indian region. Using data on species occurrences collated from multiple regional floras, we describe the distribution of families, functional groups and species of Poaecea across this region, and their variation as a function of climate and geomorphology. India hosts >1100 grass species, comprising ~10% of global grass richness. Over half of these were perennial C4 grasses, with Panicoideae being the most speciose subfamily in the country. Consistent with patterns observed globally, the PACMAD clade consisting of both C3 and C4 species was more speciose in warmer regions, while the C3 subfamilies of the BEP clade, Pooideae and Bambusoideae, were more abundant in cooler regions of the country. Both total and C4 species richness were greatest in warmer districts with high moisture availability, while cooler and wetter districts with low precipitation seasonality supported greater C3 species richness. Our results spotlight previously unrecognized areas of high grass species richness in the arid and semi-arid areas of North-West India and the Deccan Peninsula in India, and call for conservation attention to neglected regions that are outside known biodiversity hotspots and protected areas.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Differential expression analysis across PD cell subpopulations, combined with MR, revealed four causal genes: SLC11A1and DDX17 (protective) and MRAS and PDIA3 (risk). These genes were enriched in antigen presentation and calcium signaling pathways and exhibited dynamic expression in astrocytes and microglia during differentiation. Subsequent protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, regulatory (SCENIC), and drug-target analyses further characterized their roles.

Their unique biology and ecological importance have made them of particular interest. Recent work revealed siphonophore genomes to be larger than in most other cnidarians. To investigate siphonophores' genome biology and develop resources for future studies, we sequenced the genome of a single Nanomia septata to chromosome scale. The haploid genome is 1.5GB across 8 chromosomes, a reduction relative to the 15 chromosomes seen in closely related hydrozoan genomes, and is highly rearranged, consistent with multiple mixing events. Genome expansion occurred through intergenic repeat expansion, with protein-coding genes shorter than in most cnidarians. We found no genomic features clearly associated with siphonophores' exceptional colony-level complexity. Gene families that play critical roles in cnidarian development have not expanded, and gene proximity was not generally correlated to their expression across zooids, except in male gonophores. To contextualize these observations, we genome sequenced 20 additional Nanomia specimens across the globe and mapped them to our chromosome-scale reference. Population genomic analyses support three previously recognized species of Nanomia, and at least one additional undescribed species. Overlapping geographic distribution of some Nanomia species suggest reproductive isolation in sympatry. Phylogenetic analyses of genome size indicate Nanomia septata and Nanomia cara have similarly large genomes between 1.5-1.7GB, while Nanomia bijuga and an undescribed species show a secondary reduction to 0.7GB.

We sought to build on this work by adapting thermal proteome profiling screens to uncover novel glucose binders involved in metabolism. We found that TSC22D4, an intrinsically-disordered, leucine-zipper protein previously linked to insulin resistance and liver fat accumulation, exhibits altered thermal stability in the presence of glucose. Furthermore, glucose decreased TSC22D4 DNA binding and altered TSC22D4 protein-protein association. Employing UV-crosslinking mass spectrometry, we found glucose binds near the C-terminal leucine zipper domain. Mutating isoleucine 322 to tryptophan (I322W) abolishes glucose binding. Crosslinking-MS and chemo-proteomic experiments suggest that glucose increases accessibility of the leucine zipper region, resulting in intra-protein contacts between C-terminal zipper domain and N-terminal intrinsically-disordered domain. TSC22D4 is essential for adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 model system, and glucose can increase nuclear localization of TSC22D4 and remodel its protein-protein interactions.

During morphogenesis, cellular self-organization and matrix development are strongly influenced by the mechanical constraints provided by surrounding tissues, suggesting that such biophysical cues should be integrated into bioprinting strategies to engineer more biomimetic grafts. Here we introduce a novel 4D bioprinting platform that spatially patterns mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC)-derived microtissues into temporally adapting support baths. By modulating the bath`s mechanical properties, we can precisely control the physical constraints applied post-printing, directing both filament geometry and cellular behavior. Support bath stiffness regulated mechano-sensitive gene expression and microtissue phenotype, with softer matrices favoring chondrogenesis and stiffer environments promoting (myo)fibrogenic differentiation. In addition, the physical properties of the support bath modulated microtissue fusion and extracellular matrix organization, with increased collagen fiber alignment in stiffer baths. Leveraging these findings, it was possible to engineer either articular cartilage, meniscus, or ligament grafts with user defined collagen architectures by simply varying the physical properties of the support bath. This platform establishes a foundation for bioprinting structurally anisotropic and phenotypically distinct constructs, thereby enabling the scalable engineering of a range of different musculoskeletal tissues.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are two NSCLC subtypes that pose challenges for accurate diagnosis using conventional methods. Existing methods are histological examination and imaging which lacks definitive histologic features and requires intense time. Methods: To address these concerns, we propose RPSLearner, which combines Random Projection (RP) for dimensionality reduction and stacking ensemble learning to accurately predict lung cancer subtypes. Specifically, multiple independent RP matrices were first generated to project the high-dimensional RNA-seq data into lower-dimensional space, whose features were subsequently concatenated. After that, we fed the fused features into a stack of diverse base classifiers and integrated the predictions from base models via a deep linear layer network. Results: Benchmarking tests on 1,333 NSCLC patients demonstrated that RPSLearner outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for lung cancer subtype classification. Specifically, RPSLearner efficiently preserved sample-to-sample distances even after significant dimension reduction, and the meta-model in RPSLearner yielded consistently higher accuracy, F1 and AUC scores than individual base models and state-of-the-art approaches for lung cancer subtyping. Besides, the feature fusion method applied in RPSLearner shown better performance than conventional scores ensemble methods. Conclusion: We developed a novel stacking learning method called RPSLearner which combines RP and stacking learning, enabling efficient and accurate identification of NSCLC subtypes. RPSLearner is a promising lung cancer subtyping model for downstream lung cancer clinical diagnosis and personalized treatment, and the framework holds the potentiality to be extended to subtyping of other types of cancer.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Experimental studies have also shown that estrogen regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a hormone system involved in many physiological processes, including blood pressure regulation. Additionally, the RAS has an interconnected relationship with calcium regulatory and bone remodeling systems. Given these dynamic interplays, how would perturbations in one system affect the others? To answer that question, we developed a physiology-based mathematical model that simulates the interactions of estrogen, key RAS components, calcium regulation, and bone remodeling. Through sensitivity analysis and model simulations, we investigated how declining estrogen levels affect the RAS and bone mineral density.

Analysis of whole blood networks revealed two subnetworks of miRNA-mRNA interactions significantly (FDR<0.05) associated with changes in FEV1/FVC. We found that miRNAs (and mRNAs) in the network-identified groups had distinct expression patterns, with miRNAs (and mRNAs) in one group having overall higher expression in COPD (decreasing FEV1/FVC) and miRNAs (and mRNAs) in the other group having overall higher expression in controls (increasing FEV1/FVC). In addition, miRNAs (and mRNAs) within the same group were positively correlated, while those in different groups were negatively correlated, indicating distinct functional roles for these miRNAs (and mRNAs) as a function of increased COPD severity. Network analysis also identified PAX5, a transcription factor master regulator of B-cell development, as the main mRNA network hub. Using ChIP-seq data in lymphoblastoid cells, we identified a PAX5 binding site overlapping with a COPD genome-wide association signal in the promoter region of ADAM19. We also found a loss of co-expression between PAX5 and ADAM19 in COPD subjects. Furthermore, in B-cell deconvoluted data, PAX5 was differentially co-expressed with genes associated with B-cell activation and differentiation, revealing a possible mechanism for the regulation of the immune response in COPD. Finally, in B-cell receptor sequencing data, PAX5 and the identified mRNA subnetworks were negatively associated (FDR<0.05) with immunoglobulin class switching, and positively associated with IgM and IgD counts. In conclusion, PAX5 is a known regulator of B-cell identity. B cells are recognized as key players in chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation in COPD.

Despite emerging as important sensors of infection to regulate immunity and inflammation, the mechanisms by which pain-sensing nociceptor neurons can detect infections are poorly defined. Using C. elegans as a tractable model host that shares many features with mammalian systems, we investigated nociceptor function during bacterial infection. Results In vivo intracellular Ca2+ imaging of nociceptor ASH neurons revealed a drastic reduction in ASH responses to aversive stimuli in Staphylococcus aureus-infected animals compared to noninfected controls. Morphological examination showed that the ASH neurons lost integrity in the sensory processes that extend to the mouth, in a pathogen growth phase-dependent manner. Neighboring neurons did not exhibit this pathogen-induced neurodegeneration (PaIN) phenotype. Genetic analysis suggested that apoptosis, necrosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy are dispensable for the PaIN phenotype. In contrast, loss of the evolutionarily conserved stress-response transcription factor HLH-30/TFEB reduced the penetrance of ASH PaIN by about 50%. Moreover, infected animals showed defective ASH-mediated evasive behaviors, suggesting that the S. aureus-triggered drop in ASH activation and morphological degeneration are physiologically relevant. Conclusions Collectively, these findings reveal that nociceptor neurons lose functional and morphological integrity during infection with S. aureus, with severe consequences for animal behavior.

Using virtual reality, we studied people performing a realistic bimanual plate-lifting task while learning to account for a visual gain distortion applied to the right hand. We measured adaptation of early hand speed and the final plate position in three task conditions: bimanual lifting to a narrow target, unimanual lifting to a narrow target, and bimanual lifting to a wide target. As in previous studies, both hands initially adjusted to the distortion in bimanual conditions. But ultimately only the right hand adapted its speed and showed after-effects, contrasting prior reports. Contrary to our expectation, participants did not adapt early speed more when using one versus two hands. When we widened the target zone, participants achieved greater success in final plate position without reducing adaptation of early speed. Finally, both bimanual groups used a strategy of tilting the plate to be successful and showed no after-effects in final plate position when the distortion was removed.

These findings reveal that in naturalistic tasks, people leverage multiple movement strategies to achieve goals. Overall, our findings support established principles of adaptation but also challenge expectations derived from more constrained motor learning paradigms, highlighting the importance of studying motor learning in more naturalistic contexts.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Understanding the mechanisms underlying brain dynamics is a long-held goal in neuroscience. However, these dynamics are both individualized and nonstationary, making modeling challenging. Here, we present a data-driven approach to modeling nonstationary dynamics based on principles of neuromodulation, at the level of individual subjects. Approach. Previously, we developed the mesoscale individualized neural dynamics (MINDy) modeling approach to capture individualized brain dynamics which do not change over time. Here, we extend the MINDy approach by adding a modulatory component which is multiplied by a set of baseline, stationary connectivity weights. We validate this model on both synthetic data and publicly available EEG data in the context of anesthesia, a known modulator of neural dynamics. Main Results. We find that our modulated MINDy approach is accurate, individualized, and reliable. Additionally, we find that our models yield biologically interpretable inferences regarding the effects of propofol anesthesia on mesoscale cortical networks, consistent with previous literature on the neuromodulatory effects of propofol. Significance. Ultimately, our data-driven modeling approach is reliable and scalable, and provides insight into mechanisms underlying observed brain dynamics. Our modeling methodology can be used to infer insights about modulation dynamics in the brain in a number of different contexts.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Research on anxiety and cognitive effort are mixed: some studies suggest anxiety increases the perceived effort cost and avoidance, while others indicate that cognitive effort engagement can serve as an adaptive coping strategy. To reconcile these perspectives, we examined the interaction between state and trait anxiety on cognitive effort evaluation and engagement in two experiments. We hypothesized that state anxiety enhances task engagement as difficulty increases, and that this effect is diminished in individuals with high trait anxiety. Experiment 1 assessed self-reported anxiety in an online sample, while Experiment 2 manipulated state anxiety through autobiographical recall. Both experiments employed flow induction and effort discounting paradigms. Across both studies, the effect of state anxiety on task engagement depended on trait anxiety, but the direction of the state anxiety effect was opposite to the effect we predicted. In Experiment 1, participants with low trait anxiety reported reduced task engagement, as indexed by lower flow scores, when state anxiety was higher, but only in easy tasks. This effect was attenuated in participants with higher trait anxiety. The same pattern was observed in Experiment 2, but this time the interaction between trait and state anxiety was present regardless of task difficulty. These findings suggest that trait anxiety may reflect reduced impact of state anxiety on task disengagement.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Whether this relationship is causal or spurious is unknown. We previously reported a novel Hfe-/-xTfr2mut mouse model of hemochromatosis with elevated brain iron (~1.5-1.8x). We now show these mice have reduced substantia nigra tyrosine hydroxylase expression at 3 months and 9 months age, sometimes exhibit severe hindlimb clasping by 7-8 months, have impaired rotarod and balance beam performance at 9 months and are untestable on the pole test. These parkinsonian features place the model at the forefront of genetic mouse models of PD, which generally do not show both TH loss and motor impairment. This confirms hemochromatosis-related mutations can cause parkinsonian features, substantiating causality of epidemiological relationships. Despite total brain iron elevation, neuronal iron remains low in Hfe-/-xTfr2mut mice, consistent with hemochromatosis-related mutations disrupting the normal, iron-responsive regulation of the neuronal iron exporter ferroportin by hepcidin. Parkinsonian features may reflect reduced mitochondrial respiratory complex (MRC) activity due to functional neuronal iron depletion. This may be exacerbated by indiscriminate chelation and could instead respond to drugs targeting the hepcidin-ferroportin axis or MRC activity. This new model of chronic parkinsonism that increases with age provides unprecedented insights into the complex relationships of brain iron regulation and movement impairment. Since parkinsonism of diverse etiologies can exhibit iron dysregulation, the model may facilitate pre-clinical to end-stage studies relevant to both sporadic and genetic PD.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

M.; Dexter, T.; Noback, M.; Flesher, M. M.; Achim, C.; Fields, J. A.; Minassian, A.; Brody, A.; Young, J. W.", "abstract": "Rationale: Antiretroviral development has improved the longevity of people with HIV (PWH), but many experience impaired cognition potentially due to neuroinflammation. PWH smoke cigarettes at higher rates than the general population, possibly for self medication given cognitive-enhancing and anti-inflammatory properties of nicotine, the primary psychoactive ingredient cigarette smoke. We hypothesized that chronic nicotine would improve cognition in a mouse model of HIV, gp120 transgenic (Tg) mice, and reduce neuroinflammation. Methods: Male and female gp120 Tg mice (n=64) and littermate controls (n=67) were operantly trained then tested for effortful motivation in the progressive ratio breakpoint task (PRBT). Mice were counter-balanced into three groups for saline or nicotine minipump implantation (0, 14 or 40 mg/kg/day) then retested 25 days later in the PRBT, probabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT; reinforcement learning and cognitive flexibility), and Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; risk-based decision-making), with a subset tested for neuroinflammation (Iba1 levels). Results: Gp120-Tg mice exhibited worse PRLT performance, attenuated by nicotine. Furthermore, nicotine selectively optimized their response strategies in the PRLT and IGT, increasing loss sensitivity, shifting animals towards safer responses. No motivation effects were observed. Nicotine also reduced Iba1 expression, suggesting that its cognitive-enhancing effects may relate to reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusion: Gp120 Tg mice exhibited deficits in the PRLT, which are attenuated by chronic nicotine. Furthermore, nicotine improved reinforcement learning and risky decision-making supporting its therapeutic potential for cognitive deficits in PWH, possibly via reducing neuroinflammation. With potential negative consequences of long-term nicotine use, future studies should determine its mechanism of action to develop more targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

M.; Zoller, K. A.; Fastiggi, V. A.; Ather, J. L.; Poynter, M. E.", "abstract": "NLRP3 inflammasome activation induces the cleavage and secretion of IL-1{beta} and IL-18, and causes pyroptosis. Generated during times of energetic crisis (e.g., caloric insufficiency), the ketone body {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) has been reported to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, the conditions under which BHB exerts this activity and whether other short-chain carboxylic acids (SCCAs) share this effect are unexplored. Since BHB is often produced in high abundance endogenously accompanied by metabolic acidosis, we aimed to examine the pH-dependence for the ability of BHB and similar molecules to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and to test receptors conferring these effects. Whereas {beta}-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) enantiomers function equivalently to dose-dependently inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome-induced IL-1{beta} secretion, sodium-{beta}-hydroxybutyrate (NaBHB) and NaOH-neutralized BHBA do not inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Acidifying the pH of the NaBHB stock solution or the media in which cells are exposed to NaBHB, or allowing the cells to endogenously acidify their media, enables NaBHB to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Several other SCCAs also inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a pH-dependent manner and prevent pyroptotic cell death. Finally, Free Fatty Acid Receptor 3 (GPR41/FFAR3) activation phenocopies and augments the NLRP3 inflammasome-inhibiting effects of BHBA. In conclusion, acidification licenses the ability of BHB and related SCCAs to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, in part through GPR41/FFAR3, thereby expanding the repertoire of metabolites capable of modulating this important pro-inflammatory pathway during times of energetic crisis and optimizing conditions for the potential use of ketone bodies as anti-inflammatories.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

We previously designed a bioinformatics-based candidate selection pipeline (CASS) and identified potential novel gonococcal vaccine targets among hypothetical proteins expressed during natural human infection. One of these candidates, NGO1701, is a predicted periplasmic four-helix bundle protein with amino acid sequence homology to the copper storage protein 1 (Csp1) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. In this study, we confirmed that purified NGO1701 binds 15 Cu(I) ions per monomer in vitro, supporting its function as Csp in N. gonorrhoeae. Using a ngo1701 deletion mutant generated in N. gonorrhoeae F62, we investigated its role in bacteria physiology. We showed that ablation of Csp was not limiting for bacterial growth and fitness in vitro, but the {Delta}csp strain became significantly more susceptible to copper mediated toxicity. This phenotype was rescued by csp gene complementation, indicating a role in protection against copper toxicity. Our results indicate that Csp participates in periplasmic copper homeostasis in N. gonorrhoeae, buffering excess copper to reduce toxicity and playing a putative role in copper delivery to important copper-enzymes. Csp does not appear to be involved in bacterial host cell interaction and activation in vitro, since no difference in the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to adhere/invade epithelial cells or induce IL-8 secretion was reported among wild type, csp deletion mutant and complemented strains. Furthermore, sera from mice immunized with NGO1701 failed to recognize {Delta}csp by dot blot and ELISA, and the sera s ability to kill N. gonorrhoeae was abrogated against {Delta}csp. However, both functions were restored after gene complementation, supporting the relevance of Csp as a potential vaccine target. Allelic analysis of Neisseria species revealed that this gene is absent in N. meningitidis, thus making it a gonococcal-specific target.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

The combined role of the parasite and the host's immune response in determining disease severity has made it challenging to discover new anti-leishmanial treatments. Previous work from our lab has established that the dermal lymphatic network is necessary for wound resolution in a model of healing CL with Leishmania major parasites. In CL, lymphatic remodeling allows for accumulated fluid to drain from the lesional site, thereby reducing disease severity. In this report, we present a new mechanism of immunopathology during non-healing CL brought about by L. amazonensis infection. We show non-healing CL develops alongside an accumulation of cells and fluid in the skin, resulting in chronic inflammation. Lymphatic remodeling is attenuated during the chronic phase of L. amazonensis infection. Moreover, the percentage of proliferating lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) decreases from 6 to 12 weeks post infection (wpi), leading to a decrease over time in lymphatic vessel (LV) density. To induce lymphangiogenesis, exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) was administered by adenoviral delivery. VEGF-C increased LV dilation leading to reduced lesion sizes without altering parasite burdens, arguing targeting the lymphatics can alleviate immunopathology. Taken together, these results show impaired lymphatic function contributes to non-healing disease due to L. amazonensis infection and the lymphatics can be targeted to decrease inflammation in the skin during infection.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Defining the transcriptional and translational programs that govern these processes is critical for understanding airway disease and advancing regenerative therapies. Objectives: To map the transcriptional landscape of the human airway epithelium and identify regulatory factors controlling basal stem cell function and epithelial differentiation. Methods: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on bronchial biopsies from nine healthy never-smokers, categorized into young (<40 years) and aged (>60 years) cohorts. Unbiased cell type annotation and pseudotime trajectory analysis were used to define cell states and transcription factor dynamics. Measurements and Main Results: All major airway epithelial cell types were identified, with conserved composition and transcriptional programs across age groups. Basal stem cells (BSCs) exhibited elevated ribosomal gene expression, indicating increased translational readiness. Pseudotime analysis revealed transitions from basal to differentiated states, with MYC, JUN, and FOS upregulated in proliferative suprabasal cells. HLF emerged as a BSC-enriched transcription factor downregulated upon differentiation. Functional assays showed that HLF overexpression suppresses proliferation in airway BSC and in lung squamous carcinoma cells, while Hlf-deficient mice display basal cell hyperplasia and deficient differentiation. In lung cancer datasets, low HLF expression correlated with worse patient survival. Conclusions: This study defines conserved gene programs in the human airway epithelium and identifies HLF as a novel regulator of BSC proliferation and potential tumor suppressor.

The effect of ABVD treatment on ovarian reserve and fertility has not been fully characterized, and whether fertility preservation is required is controversial and not empirically known. Methods: Eight-week-old female mice were injected intravenously with saline solution or ABVD for 4 weeks, respectively. Estrous cycles, level of serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), body weight and ovary weight were recorded. Ovarian tissue structure and the number of follicles at each stage were analysed. IVF assay and natural mating trials were performed. Finally, transcriptome sequencing of ovarian tissue was conducted. Results: Most mice completely lost their estrous cycle soon after ABVD injection. After 4 cycles of treatments, the body weight gain and gross ovarian weight were significantly lower than those of the control. However, estrous cycles were returned to normal at 4 weeks after ABVD discontinuation. Serum AMH and the numbers of primordial follicles were significantly increased compared to controls. ABVD withdrawal did not affect the rate of cleavage or blastocyst formation in IVF assays. Furthermore, the mice were fertile and there was no significant difference in offspring weight, but the number of offspring in the ABVD discontinuation group was smaller compared with the controls. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the JAK/STAT pathway, which is involved in the inhibition of primordial follicles activation and apoptosis, was upregulated in ABVD-treated ovaries, whereas few gene expressions were altered 4 weeks after ABVD withdrawal. Conclusions: The ovarian reserve and reproductive function can be recovered after ABVD treatment, and combined ABVD treatment for a short time has a beneficial effect on the ovarian reserve, which can be used to provide a basis for guiding fertility preservation decision-making for HL patients.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

In this shifting disease landscape, it is important to leverage tools that can predict the potential distributions of invading vectors to target surveillance and control efforts and identify at risk populations. Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are widely used to predict ranges of invasive species; however, invasive species often violate assumptions of equilibrium and niche conservatism. Moreover, these studies are rarely validated using independent data. Here, we use long-term mosquito surveillance data for Aedes albopictus, a highly invasive mosquito capable of transmitting several arboviruses, at its range-edge to evaluate a variety of SDMs (MaxEnt, GAM, Random Forest, Boosted Regression Tree) in predicting Ae. albopictus range. We identify key environmental drivers of distributions and areas where models tended to disagree in predicting occurrence. At sites where models disagree, we sampled for Ae. albopictus to generate an independent dataset for field-validation of models in addition to the common practice of cross-validation. Finally, we determine if models based on early invasion data can predict later stage invasion ranges. We found that landscape and climatic variables are important drivers of population distributions. SDM methods varied in predictive accuracy between models and across validation methods (i.e. cross- vs. field-validation). GAM and MaxEnt best predicted later-stage invasion distributions, requiring fewer years of training data.

In a previous study, we developed an optimization pipeline, utilizing stochastic simulations and an evolutionary algorithm, suitable for the joint optimization of multiple class and continuous parameters. Here, we assess the applicability of our framework to realistic plant breeding schemes. For this, a wheat line breeding scheme simulated using AlphaSimR and a wheat hybrid breeding scheme simulated using MoBPS were considered. Both schemes were further optimized using our optimization pipeline. When aiming to maximize genetic gain while maintaining a fixed budget, the breeding program design suggested by our optimization pipeline results in 32.6% higher genetic gain compared to a proposed baseline wheat line breeding program. When adjusting the breeding objective to put 20% of the weight on the maintenance of genetic diversity, genetic gain still increased by 4.5% while maintaining 9.1% higher genetic diversity compared to the baseline. Similarly, 4.6%/8.8% higher genetic gains for the male/female part of the hybrid breeding scheme compared to its baseline scenario were obtained.

We explore this issue using goddard (gdrd), an orphan gene essential for spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Although the Gdrd protein has maintained structural conservation across the Drosophila genus, its overall length and primary sequences, especially at its disordered termini, show substantial divergence. Using gene swaps assays that included gdrd orthologs from multiple species across different evolutionary distances, we investigated how lineage-specific evolutionary changes have affected Goddard's ability to function in D. melanogaster. Our results indicate that most orthologs possess the ability to interact with axonemes and insect ring centrioles in D. melanogaster, suggesting these interactions could have been present in the orthologs' common ancestor. Surprisingly, a highly divergent ortholog from D. mojavensis fully rescued fertility in goddard null D. melanogaster, indicating that the Gdrd protein at the base of the Drosophila genus was most likely fully integrated into an essential spermatogenesis pathway. However, several orthologs, including one from a more closely related species, failed to complement fertility in D. melanogaster. All of these complementation failures correlated with weaker axonemal binding. Furthermore, we noted that all tested orthologs exhibited divergent subcellular localization patterns. In parallel with these gene swap studies, we computationally analyzed each ortholog's structural stability and flexibility, physicochemical properties within its intrinsically disordered regions, and amino acid sequence divergence. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated structural instability in the most closely related, non-functional ortholog, while shared motifs identified in the disordered termini correlated with functionality, notably present in D. mojavensis and D. melanogaster but absent in non-rescuing orthologs. These findings suggest that although Goddard's central structure and key interactions likely existed at the base of the Drosophila genus, several orthologs have undergone consequential lineage-specific evolutionary changes.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

While significant progress has been made in migratory birds, where multiple compass systems are well described, similar knowledge for migratory Lepidoptera remains limited. Most insights into butterfly and moth orientation come from just two species: the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and the Australian Bogong moth (Agrotis infusa), both of which possess multimodal compass systems involving visual and geomagnetic cues. However, these species follow unusual migratory strategies that include diapause or aestivation and multigenerational round-trip migrations between breeding region and very specific non-breeding areas, that are not representative of most other Lepidoptera migrants. In contrast, European species such as the painted lady (Vanessa cardui) and red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) undertake regular seasonal migrations involving multiple generations and no diapause, yet the sensory mechanisms guiding their orientation remain largely unexplored. Here, we report findings from a two-year study investigating compass orientation in red admirals using a flight simulator under a range of controlled light and magnetic conditions. Our experiments yielded three key results: (1) red admirals orient using solar cues when selecting migratory direction; (2) the sun compass in this species appears to be time-independent, as clock-shifted individuals did not alter orientation; and (3) there is no sign of magnetic sense in red admirals. These findings sharply contrast with those from monarch butterflies, which rely on both time-compensated sun and light-dependent magnetic compasses. Our results reveal important interspecific variation in compass use among diurnal Lepidoptera and underscore the need to expand orientation research beyond traditional model systems to better understand the diversity of migratory strategies and orientation mechanisms in migratory Lepidoptera.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Due to its high conservation, the 3CLpro is relatively stable across all these variants without significant changes, suggesting that drugs targeting this enzyme could be effective against all variant viruses. And compared to traditional antibodies, nanobodies show significant advantages against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Traditional antibodies often lose their inhibitory activity due to viral mutation. Nanobodies are characterised by their small size, high stability, high affinity for antigen binding, and high water solubility, which enable them to capture viruses quickly and effectively address the continuous mutations and persistent infections of SARS-CoV-2. In this research, we devised a strategy to produce nanobodies by utilizing a fragment-generating large language model, resulting in the identification of a nanobody named Nb01. Nb01 exhibits potent and broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants. The nanobody Nb01, directed against the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, demonstrated efficacy against the majority of prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, it has a higher affinity than the current best performing nanobodies (S43, bn03, R14, and 3-2A2-4) for most of the variants, including the Alpha (27.5%), Gamma (29.7%), Omicron BA.2 (32.2%), BA.4/5 (81.2%), BF.7 (64.2%) and XBB (5.5%) variants. For other variants, Nb01 displayed affinities that were on par with these benchmark nanobodies.

To cite just one interesting example, using quantile regression we are able to show that even though variants at the G6PC2 locus increase glucose levels, their effects are much stronger at lower quantiles of glucose level distribution than at higher quantiles, showing that G6PC2 serves as a guardian against low glucose levels without driving dangerous hyperglycemia, which may explain the lack of association with diabetes risk.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Integrated eCLIP and RNA-sequencing analysis identify that poly(U)-binding splicing factor 60 (PUF60) drives exon inclusion within proliferation-associated transcripts that, when mis-spliced, induce cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. Furthermore, disrupting PUF60 interactions with 3' splice sites via a substitution in its RNA-binding domain causes widespread exon skipping, leading to downregulation of proliferation-associated mRNAs and inducing apoptosis in TNBC cells. We demonstrate that loss of PUF60-RNA interactions inhibits TNBC cell proliferation and shrinks tumor xenografts, revealing the molecular mechanism by which PUF60 supports cancer progression.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Prior studies suggest a role for Miro1 in cell migration and proliferation in both normal and tumor cells. High Miro1 expression is associated with poor overall survival in breast cancer patients. To investigate the role of Miro1 in breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis, we established stable Miro1 knockdown (KD) in MDA-MB-231 human triple-negative breast cancer cells using shRNA. Miro1 KD significantly impaired cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. When implanted into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice, MDA-MB-231 cells formed tumors, whereas Miro1 KD cells showed markedly reduced tumorigenesis. Additionally, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model with inducible, tissue-specific Miro1 deletion in mammary epithelial cells, alongside polyomavirus middle T-antigen (PyVMT) oncogene activation. In this model, wild-type (WT) mice formed tumors at all mammary gland sites, with frequent lung metastases. However, Miro1-deficient mice failed to develop tumors, while heterozygous mice exhibited reduced tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, these findings identify Miro1 as a key regulator of breast cancer onset and metastatic potential, positioning it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

S.; Ghosh, K.", "abstract": "Activated neutrophils contribute to retinal endothelial cell (EC) death and capillary degeneration associated with early diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, the factors and mechanisms driving neutrophil activation and cytotoxicity in diabetes remain insufficiently understood. Here we show that lysyl oxidase (LOX), a collagen crosslinking and matrix stiffening enzyme that increases retinal EC susceptibility to activated neutrophils, simultaneously activates neutrophils in its alternate soluble form. Specifically, treatment of diabetic mice with LOX inhibitor {beta}-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) prevented the diabetes-induced increase in neutrophil activation (extracellular release of neutrophil elastase and superoxide) and cytotoxicity towards co-cultured mouse retinal ECs. Mouse neutrophils and differentiated (neutrophil-like) human HL-60 cells treated with recombinant LOX alone exhibited similar activation and cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, this LOX-induced neutrophil activation was associated with biphasic F-actin remodeling, with the initial and rapid (<15 min) F-actin depolymerization followed by a significant increase in F-actin polymerization and polarization. Preventing the initial F-actin depolymerization blocked LOX-induced neutrophil activation and cytotoxicity towards co-cultured retinal ECs. Finally, we show that this biphasic F-actin remodeling is essential for LOX-induced membrane clustering of azurophilic granule marker CD63 and NADPH organizer p47 that are associated with extracellular release of neutrophil elastase and superoxide, respectively. By revealing a causal and previously unrecognized link between LOX and actin-dependent neutrophil activation in diabetes, these findings provide fresh mechanistic insights into the proinflammatory role of LOX in early DR that goes beyond its canonical matrix-stiffening effects.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

The gene WW-domain containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) has been identified in recent LOAD risk meta-analyses, yet its function in the brain is poorly understood. Using Drosophila, we discovered that knockdown of the highly conserved Wwox gene impacts longevity and sleep, having roles in both neuronal and glial subtypes. In an amyloid beta 42 (A{beta}42) transgenic model of AD, RNAi- mediated knockdown of Wwox significantly decreased both lifespan and locomotion whilst elevating soluble A{beta}42. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that these effects were accompanied by elevated lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) mRNA and lactate levels, downstream of an increase in the key unfolded protein response protein Atf4. Strikingly, we found that upregulation of Wwox in the A{beta}42 model through CRISPR activation significantly reduced amyloid load, improved longevity and locomotion. Multi-omics analysis revealed Wwox upregulation partially reversed several key A{beta}42-induced transcriptional pathways in the brain and reduced levels of L-methionine and associated enzymes. These findings support a role for reduced WWOX levels in the genetic risk of developing LOAD via pyruvate metabolism and point towards WWOX activation as a protective therapeutic strategy.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

The Continuous Relative Phase (CRP) method quantifies lower-limb coordination by assessing the phase relationships between joints. However, the reliability of CRP measurements during walking in individuals with CP remains unexplored, and may be affected by measurement variability due to marker placement errors, soft tissue artifacts, and natural movement fluctuations. Quantifying this reliability is important for appropriate clinical comparisons. This study aimed to quantify within- and between-assessor reliability of lower-limb CRP measurements in individuals with CP and their non-impaired (NI) peers. Methods: CP (n=19, age=18.4 (7.3) years, GMFCS I to III) and NI (n=19, age=18.3 (11.2) years) individuals completed two gait assessment sessions, each including 3D motion capture of at least 10 walking trials. Two trained assessors independently placed reflective markers and conducted gait analyses. Standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change (MDC) were computed for knee-hip and ankle-knee coordination across gait subphases. Findings: The SEM and MDC were lower for knee-hip than ankle-knee coordination, suggesting higher measurement reliability for proximal joint coupling. For knee-hip coordination, MDC reached 15.1 (0.7) deg (CP) and 9.3 (0.6) deg (NI) between assessors, and 23.8 (3.0) deg (CP) and 9.1 (1.6) deg (NI) within assessors. For ankle-knee coordination, MDC reached 29.0 (2.6) deg (CP) and 25.0 (3.5) deg (NI) between assessors, peaking at 47.3 (10.9) deg (CP) and 28.6 (1.5) deg (NI) in mid-swing within assessors.

A series of FtsZ-associated proteins (Zaps), which crosslink FtsZ filaments, promote Z ring formation in Escherichia coli. However, how these proteins interact with FtsZ is still unclear. In this study, we discover that ZapC binds to both FtsZs globular domain and its conserved C-terminal peptide (CCTP) to crosslink FtsZ filaments. An AlphaFold 3 structural model of the FtsZ-ZapC complex indicates that ZapC binds to the globular domain of FtsZ via a loop region connecting its N-terminal and C-terminal domains and to the CCTP of FtsZ via a hydrophobic pocket in the N-terminal domain. Substitutions in these regions of ZapC disrupt its binding to FtsZ, validating the dual binding mode. Strikingly, we find that the intrinsically disordered C-terminal linker (CTL) of FtsZ affects the interaction of FtsZ with ZapC as well as other partners, indicating an important role of the CTL in FtsZ functionality.

Lateral transfer of carbon needs to be more widely studied, especially in smaller streams and catchments, as they receive high loading of organic matter and are hotspots of carbon degradation. In this study we combined measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and quantity with microbial community data from a small Arctic catchment. Our aim was to understand how the catchment is affected by two sub-catchments, degrading palsa permafrost mire and peatland thawing in spring. The small thaw ponds in the palsa mire were clearly distinct from the rest of the catchment and ponds in the peatland. Palsa ponds had higher DOM quantity, more aromatic DOM and distinct microbial communities.

D.; Brow, D. A.", "abstract": "Anti-termination factors for eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) that are released upon binding sequences in the terminator of nascent transcripts were proposed almost 40 years ago but few candidates have been found. Here we report genetic evidence that the yeast nuclear RNA-binding protein Hrp1, also known as Nab4 and CF1B, acts as an RNAP II anti-termination factor. A Lys to Glu substitution at residue 9 (K9E) of the Rpb3 subunit of RNAP II causes readthrough of Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1-dependent (NNS) terminators and cold-sensitive growth, as does Asp but not Ala, Met, Arg, or Gln substitution. These allele-specific phenotypes and the location of Rpb3-K9 suggests substitution with Glu or Asp stabilizes binding of an anti-termination factor via a salt bridge. A genome-wide selection for suppressors of the cold-sensitivity of Rpb3-K9E yielded an Arg to Gly substitution at residue 317 of Hrp1 in RNA recognition motif 2 (RRM2), consistent with the hypothesis. A targeted selection for suppressors of Rpb3-K9E in HRP1 yielded substitutions in RRMs 1 and 2, an essential Met- and Gln-rich region C-terminal to the RRMs, and other mutations. We propose that Hrp1 binds to the RNAP II elongation complex via these regions to promote elongation and, in the presence of Rpb3-K9E, is less rapidly released upon binding terminator sequences in the nascent transcript, resulting in terminator readthrough. The Rpb3-K9E-suppressor substitutions in Hrp1 likely weaken binding to the RNAP II elongation complex, compensating for Rpb3-K9E.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

In order to slide fast on nonspecific DNA but still bind strongly at specific sequences, TFs have been proposed to change from search conformation to recognition conformation upon binding. For the lac repressor of E. coli, LacI, the folding of the hinge helices has been implicated in the conformational switch. Here, we have tested how the flexibility of the hinge region impacts the speed of search and the stability of binding. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, we selected two LacI mutants that favor search and recognition confirmation, respectively. We measured the binding kinetics of the mutants both in vitro on DNA microarrays with 2,479 different Lac operators and in vivo using single-molecule experiments in living cells. We conclude that a more flexible hinge helix enhances the specificity of the TF but reduces binding strength, while a more stable hinge helix has the opposite effect. The impact of altered binding specificity on target DNA search speed is, however, lower than expected. Instead, the ability of LacI to allosterically change its conformation in response to an inducer limits the stability of the recognition conformation, i.e., the trade-off in LacI binding is in stability vs inducibility rather than speed vs stability.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

We find that reduction in endogenous Sox2 transcription is correlated with the strength of the inserted promoter. Transcription from the inserted promoter is required for competition, with longer transcript resulting in more competition. Furthermore, competition is dependent on the location of the inserted promoter, but independent of cohesin mediated loop extrusion.

R.; Hu, J.; Hofman, C.; Tse, V.", "abstract": "R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures consisting of an RNA/DNA hybrid and a displaced strand of DNA. These structures have been implicated in a variety of regulatory cellular processes. Their untimed or excess accumulation, however, can cause genomic instability and induce DNA damage. Most R-loops form co-transcriptionally when the nascent transcript reanneals to unwound DNA duplex. Changes in the rate of transcription have the potential to impact R-loop formation, and compounds that modulate R-loop formation would be useful molecular tools and therapeutic leads. Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specific Factor 3 (CPSF3) recognizes the pre-mRNA 3' cleavage site, cleaves the transcript prior to polyadenylation, and has been linked to R-loop formation. Inhibition of CPSF3 has been found to induce transcriptional readthrough and cell proliferation defects. A previous report suggested that inhibition of CPSF3 with a small molecule causes a global increase in R-loop abundance. Here we test the impact of YT-II-100, a novel inhibitor of CPSF3. We find that addition of YT-II-100 increases global R-loop formation but does not change R-loop formation at specific genes that are normally used as positive controls for R-loop formation. We performed parallel assays using previously reported compound JTE-607 and observed similar results. Our data emphasize the need for cautious interpretation of experiments using JTE-607 and YT-II-100.

Here we have applied a novel single particle fluorescence technique known as Burst Analysis Spectroscopy (BAS) to the study of the E. coli sHsps IbpA and IbpB (IbpAB). We show that in the presence of IbpAB, two different model proteins converge toward similar, limited aggregate particle size distributions. Additionally, while IbpAB dramatically accelerates the disassembly of protein aggregates by the bacterial KJEB bi-chaperone disaggregase, this enhancement does not appear to be strongly influenced by aggregate particle size. Rather, it is the ability of IbpAB to alter aggregate structure during particle formation that appears to be essential for stimulated disassembly. These observations support a model of aggregate recognition by IbpAB that is not only highly adaptable but capable of shaping aggregate particles into a specialized range of physical properties that are necessary for efficient protein disaggregation.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

In Bacillus subtilis, there is an intricate developmental program which involves the precise coordination of gene expression and ongoing morphological changes to yield the mature spore. The histone-like protein HBsu is involved in proper spore packaging and compaction of the chromosomal DNA. Previously, we found that the acetylation of different lysine residues on HBsu impairs sporulation frequency and spore resistance properties. One mechanism by which HBsu influences the process of sporulation could be through the regulation of gene expression. To test this idea, we performed RT-qPCR to analyze gene expression throughout the sporulation process in wildtype and seven acetylation-mimicking (glutamine substitutions) mutant strains. Acetylation of HBsu at K41 increased the expression of key early and late sporulation genes, especially during the later stages. For example, overexpression of {sigma}F and {sigma}G drive expression of their regulon members at inappropriate times. These findings suggest that K41 acetylation activates gene expression and might represent an on-off switch for important regulatory factors as cells transition from early to late phases. The gene expression profiles of hbsK3Q, hbsK37Q, hbsK75Q, hbsK80Q, and hbsK86Q mutants were largely unchanged, but did have significant reductions of key late sporulation proteins, which could explain the observed defects in spore resistance properties.

Altered selection on genes encoding the respiratory nitrate reductase were specific to Burkholderiales, a major group of denitrifying bacteria. We provide evidence that agriculture is driving evolution of protein regions implicated in substrate access to the enzyme's active site, possibly resulting in increased rates of nitrate reduction. We hypothesise that increasing substrate turnover would be evolutionarily advantageous under excess nitrate availability, ultimately enhancing growth rates despite potential enzymatic trade-offs.

Because gene exchange will blur the historically defined species boundaries, we assessed the patterns and extent of recombination for nearly 2,000 fully sequenced Bacteroides genomes representing 36 named species, and redefined species boundaries based on their capacity to exchange genes. We recognized numerous incongruences between traditional classification schemes, those based on nucleotide sequence identity thresholds, and species defined by gene flow. Almost all named species of sufficient sample size for analysis included genomes that failed to recombine with other genomes that were historically assigned to the same species. Such misclassifications occurred even for cases in which sequence identities surpassed the thresholds regularly used to define species. Conversely, we detected instances in which species previously considered distinct were found to recombine extensively--the most striking of which supported unification of B. kribbi, B. koreensis, and B. ovatus (which freely recombines with B. xylanisolvens). Among the broadly distributed populations of B. fragilis, we detected elevated levels of recombination among human-derived strains, although this result is confounded by geographic and sampling biases.

Using the conceptual, process-based model 'Lake2D', we addressed the question: To what extent can pelagic and benthic producer dynamics, integrated over a lake basin, be captured by approaches that use mean depth as the only morphometrical variable? We created two models of algal biomass dynamics in a radially symmetric, cone-shaped lake - one preserving the lake's vertical and radial dimensions and one preserving only the lake's mean depth - and compared model predictions of algal biomass dynamics across a wide range of lake sizes, mixing conditions, water transparency, and nutrient content. Our analyses reveal that model predictions differ substantially but predictably in much of the investigated parameter space, and identifies the light environment set by lake depth, water clarity and pelagic nutrients, but also lake area, as main drivers of the differences. Most commonly, the model based on mean depth underestimates benthic algal biomass and overestimates pelagic algal biomass, the net effect on total biomass being a 5-50% underestimate in shallow lakes and a 5-20% overestimate in many deeper lakes. Since gross primary production (GPP) in our model scales with algal biomass, we believe that global estimates of lake GPP should be corrected for the systematic errors inflicted by the prevailing 1-dimensional approaches.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Plants and animals typically have several classes of small RNAs, along with multiple Argonautes. These Argonautes often confer distinct functionality to the various classes of small RNAs. But how small RNAs are selectively loaded into the appropriate Argonaute is not well understood. miRNAs and siRNAs are typically generated from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors by the endoribonuclease Dicer. siRNAs are often processed from fully base-paired precursors derived from various endogenous and exogenous sources, whereas miRNAs typically originate from genetically encoded partially base-paired hairpins. In C. elegans, Dicer/DCR-1 processing of siRNAs and a related small RNA class, known as 26G-RNAs, is mediated by the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4. Here, we show that RDE-4 also facilitates loading of siRNAs (but not miRNAs) into the Argonaute RDE-1, but not into ALG-1, and loading of 26G-RNAs into the Argonaute ERGO-1. Although we do not find evidence that ALG-3/4 associated 26G-RNAs require RDE-4 for Argonaute loading, their levels are strongly reduced in rde-4 mutants indicating that RDE-4 is broadly required for their formation or stability.

Our team utilizes a femtosecond-laser-cut lens capsule disc as a bioengineering scaffold, taking advantage of this novel tissue,s biocompatibility, transparency, curvature, and availability. In the present study, we provide proof of concept, in 12 TEEKs, that it is possible to control the final endothelial cell density (ECD) by varying the seeding density per mm2. Cell characterization was performed through morphometric analysis of the endothelial mosaic stained with anti-NCAM (a lateral membrane marker used as a differentiation marker), using the CellPose artificial intelligence algorithm specifically trained for in vitro endothelium segmentation. Five criteria related to pleomorphism, polymorphism, and elongation were combined into a single endothelial quality score. The median cell viability at 28 days of culture, assessed by Hoechst 33342 and Calcein-AM staining, reached 98% (range: 83-99%). The median viable ECD (number of live cells per surface unit) in the highest-density group was 3,245 cells/mm2 (range: 2,778-3,753), paving the way for the bioengineering of supra-physiological TEEKs, or super TEEKs.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Those datasets are based on census conducted at national/sub-national scale which are then downscaled using machine learning algorithm and relevant spatial-explicit environmental predictors. The most known dataset of livestock disaggregated observations is the Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW), which produces global maps of livestock density at 10 km spatial resolution for several livestock species. Though this spatial resolution can be appropriate to describe livestock distribution at the global scale, it inherently leads to a coarse representation of breeding species density for smaller territories such as the Caribbean Islands. In this study, we propose an adaptation of the GLW methodology that accounts for the spatial autocorrelation in observed cattle distribution, thereby better capturing the specific characteristics of geographically limited areas such as the Guadeloupean archipelago. Cattle census data were collected for the 32 municipalities of the archipelago and associated to environmental predictors derived from remote sensing and land cover datasets. Together with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm used in the standard GLW methodology, we tested the performance of a Geographical Random Forest (GRF), a novel methodology allowing for taking into account the spatial autocorrelation of the response variable. The GRF algorithm demonstrated significantly better performance compared to the RF algorithm, albeit with longer processing times, and allowed us producing cattle distribution maps for the entire Guadeloupe archipelago at a spatial resolution of 225 m using both algorithms. The approach developed holds potential for application to other small territories, including other islands in the Caribbean.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Our data demonstrate that early multipotent RGPs generate all extra-telencephalic (ET) and intra-telencephalic (IT) PNs across all layers through parallel sublineages and the random specification, during the earliest neurogenic divisions, of fate-restricted daughter RGPs. While the neuronal production of the parental multipotent RGPs consists of small ET-PN or IT-PN outputs, fate-restricted RGPs produce larger translaminar outputs spanning deep and upper layers of only IT-PNs, the predominant mammalian PN subtype. We further show that the emergence of IT-PN fate-restricted RGPs also leads to quantitatively and temporally stereotyped neurogenesis population-wise.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Notably, when memorised content is spatially lateralised, the power of posterior alpha activity exhibits corresponding lateralisation during the retention interval, consistent with the retinotopic organisation of the visual cortex. Beyond power, alpha frequency has also been linked to memory performance, with faster alpha rhythms associated with enhanced retention. These findings position alpha oscillations as a promising target for neuromodulation. In this study, we demonstrate that although alpha frequency is not typically lateralised in a retinotopic manner during working memory retention, such lateralisation can be externally induced. Using alpha closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS), and leveraging the phase-dependent responsiveness of alpha oscillations to sound, we successfully modulated alpha frequency asymmetrically between the visual cortices. The extent of induced frequency lateralisation was associated with the behavioural asymmetry in task performance.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

A.; Geary, B.; Barnes, D.; Jonsson, A. H.; Ho, I.-C.", "abstract": "SIRPG, a primate-specific type 1 transmembrane protein in the Signal Regulatory Protein (SIRP) family, is predominantly expressed in T cells. It contains a short cytoplasmic domain, which does not contain any known signaling motif, and its only known ligand is CD47. Several genetic variations in SIRPG, including the V263A (rs6043409) polymorphism, linked to increased type 1 diabetes risk, highlight its potential importance. However, its expression and physiological role remain largely unclear due to its absence in rodents. Here, we demonstrate that SIRPG and GzmB exhibit near mutually exclusive expression in resting peripheral CD8+ T cells. We further show that SIRPG serves as a valuable marker for GzmK-expressing CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood and inflamed synovial fluid and that its expression in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is upregulated by anti-CD3 stimulation, with further enhancement by the TNF inhibitor adalimumab, but not certolizumab. While SIRPG ablation minimally affects T cell activation and IFN{gamma}/TNF production, it impairs the expression of mitosis-regulating genes like UBE2C and TOP2A, leading to reduced proliferation, and alters the expression of certain activation-induced surface molecules, including CRTAM. Notably, SIRPG-mediated proliferation and CRTAM expression are cell-autonomous and CD47-independent. Structural and functional analyses reveal that SIRPG-driven proliferation is independent of its extracellular D1 domain, not significantly affected by the V263 variant, but dependent on its cytoplasmic domain. Collectively, our findings offer novel insights into the expression, function, and mechanism of action of SIRPG in T cells.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

Primary cilia are sensory organelles present on most quiescent cells, where they play essential roles in receiving environmental and developmental signals. Given that ciliated cells are non-proliferative, we investigated whether mTORC1 signaling influences the growth of primary cilia. Here, we show that mTORC1 promotes primary cilia elongation, without effects on ciliogenesis or cell growth, by suppressing autophagy. Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling through pharmacological, nutritional, or genetic interventions gave rise to shortened primary cilia, while activation of the pathway resulted in elongation. Furthermore, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of autophagy, a key downstream process blocked by mTORC1, also elongated primary cilia and rendered them resistant to mTORC1 inhibition. Notably, these mTORC1-mediated effects on primary cilia extend to mouse neurons ex vivo and in vivo. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized role for mTORC1 signaling in the control of primary cilia length that may contribute to diseases where ciliary function is altered, referred to as ciliopathies.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

It makes early prediction of trial outcomes crucial for reducing attrition and guiding strategic decisions, especially in immunology and inflammation (I&I) diseases. Herein, we present EVA, the first pre-trained foundation model in complex inflammatory diseases tailored to support drug development. EVA learns generalizable patterns from large-scale data of cell biology and immunology, enabling superior predictive performance and generalization compared to traditional approaches. EVA is pre-trained on tens of millions of single-cell RNA-seq samples and tens of thousands of bulk RNA-seq samples from I&I diseases patients, enabling it to learn disease-relevant transcriptomic patterns in this therapeutic area. By fine-tuning EVA in few-shot settings on both preclinical (mouse) and clinical (human) data and harnessing its wide pre-training knowledge, EVA predicts drug responses in I&I with high precision at both cohort and patient levels, as illustrated by accurate forecasting of anti-TNF therapeutic activity in ulcerative colitis. By deciphering its decision process, we further highlight that EVA's ability to stratify patients based on predicted drug response can also be leveraged to discover drug response biomarkers as early as preclinical stages. EVA's applications in precision immunology encompass therapeutic target validation prior to clinical entry, identification of patient subpopulations most likely to benefit from treatment, and comparative efficacy analysis against competitor compounds. EVA's versatility makes it an invaluable tool for strategic decision-making throughout the drug development pipeline: by leveraging it to prioritize the most promising drug candidates and optimize RCT designs, it can contribute to reduce late-stage failures and accelerate the delivery of effective therapies.

J.; Gelhaus, S. L.; Lamitina, T.", "abstract": "In multicellular organisms, signaling from the nervous system to the peripheral tissues can activate physiological responses to stress. Here, we show that inter-tissue stress communication can also function in reverse, i.e. from the peripheral tissue to the nervous system. osm-8 mutants, which activate the osmotic stress response in the C. elegans skin, also exhibit defective osmotic avoidance behavior, which is regulated by the ASH neuronal avoidance circuit. osm-8 osmotic avoidance behavior is completely suppressed by mutation of the Patched/NPC1 homolog ptr-23 . The function of osm-8 and ptr-23 in the hypodermal epithelial cells is both necessary and sufficient for directing neuronal osmotic avoidance behavior. Endogenously tagged alleles of osm-8 and ptr-23 co-localize exclusively in the hypodermal lysosomes. Unbiased lipidomic analysis shows that osm-8 leads to a ptr-23 -dependent elevation of the lysosome specific lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) and expansion of the pool of hypodermal lysosomes. Just as genetic activation of the osmotic stress response by loss of osm-8 in the hypodermis causes an Osm phenotype, acute physiological exposure to osmotic stress also confers a reversible Osm phenotype. Behavioral plasticity requires glycerol production, as mutations in the glycerol biosynthetic enzymes gpdh-1 and gpdh-2 are defective in acquired Osm behavior. While the osm-8 induced Osm behavior requires ptr-23 , physiologically induced Osm behavior does not. Instead, both genetic and physiologically induced Osm phenotypes require the unusual non-neuronal lysosomal V-ATPase subunit vha-5 , which is also critical for organismal osmotic stress survival. Together, these data reveal that genetic or physiological activation of stress signaling from the skin elicits lysosome-associated signals that modulate the function of a sensory neuron circuit. Such body-brain interoceptive communication may allow organisms to better match neuronal decision-making with organismal physiological state.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is essential for almost every cognitive task and behavior. The neural and synaptic mechanisms supporting the rapid encoding and maintenance of memories in diverse tasks are the subject of an ongoing debate. The traditional view of WM as stationary persistent firing of selective neuronal populations has given room to newer ideas regarding mechanisms that support a more dynamic maintenance of multiple items, which may also tolerate more activity disruption. Various computational WM models based on different biologically plausible synaptic and neural plasticity mechanisms have been proposed. We show that these proposed short-term plasticity mechanisms may not necessarily be competing explanations, but instead yield interesting functional interactions on a wide set of WM tasks and enhance the biological plausibility of spiking neural network models, in particular of the underlying synaptic plasticity. While monolithic models (WM function explained by one particular mechanism) are theoretically appealing and have increased our understanding of specific mechanisms, they are narrow explanations. WM models need to become more capable, robust and flexible to account for new experimental evidence of bursty and activity-silent multi-item maintenance in more challenging WM tasks, and generally solve more than one particular task. More detailed models also allow for electrophysiological constraints from recordings. In this study we evaluate the interactions between three commonly used classes of plasticity, namely intrinsic excitability, synaptic facilitation/augmentation and Hebbian plasticity. Combinations of these are systematically tested in a spiking neural network model on a broad suite of tasks or functional motifs deemed principally important for WM operation, such as one-shot encoding, free and cued recall, delay maintenance and updating. In our evaluation we focus on the operational task performance and biological plausibility. Our results indicate that a composite model, combining several commonly proposed plasticity mechanisms for WM function, is superior to more reductionist variants. Importantly, we attribute the observable differences to the principle nature of specific types of plasticity.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

The human Y chromosome (chrY) is widely used in evolutionary studies, yet current references represent evolutionarily young sequences, which can lead to misleading variant calling. To address this issue, we constructed a Y-chromosomal ancestral-like reference sequence (Y-ARS) to improve the detection of evolutionarily informative variants on the Y chromosome. The Y-ARS was constructed by applying a weighted maximum parsimony approach to human and primate Y chromosome sequences. To benchmark the performance of the Y-ARS, 40 chrY short-read sequences from diverse haplogroups were aligned to Y-ARS and existing references (GRCh37, GRCh38, and T2T-CHM13). Overall, the Y-ARS yielded the highest and most consistent number of SNPs per sample (mean=1197; SD=105), while other references yielded on average fewer variants (mean=866-968) and showed greater variability across samples (SD=457-531) depending on their phylogenetic distance from the reference. Additionally, alignments to the Y-ARS resulted in calling solely SNPs with evolutionarily derived alleles, while alignments to other references resulted in calling on average 44% SNPs with ancestral alleles. This study demonstrates how the existing reference sequences fail to capture the full range of evolutionary information on the chrY. The Y-ARS improves capturing evolutionary information on the chrY, making it a valuable resource for various evolutionary applications, such as TMRCA estimations and phylogenetic analyses. Finally, alongside the Y-ARS, we provide a publicly available tool, polaryzer, to annotate variants as ancestral or derived in pre-aligned chrY data.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}

A.; Sankararaman, S.; Lohmueller, K. E.", "abstract": "Negative natural selection on deleterious mutations plays a key role in shaping human genetic variation. Understanding the dominance of deleterious mutations is critical as it can fundamentally impact the rate and efficiency of natural selection, the magnitude of inbreeding depression, and the prevalence and evolution of genetic diseases. Despite its inarguable importance, the dominance effects of mutations remain poorly understood in humans, primarily because existing statistical methods cannot distinguish them from the overall selective effects of mutations. In this work, we take a fundamentally different approach to infer dominance by leveraging the distribution of Neanderthal ancestry across the human genome. We show through simulations that recessive deleterious mutations lead to an increase in archaic introgressed ancestry in the absence of positive selection, contrary to what is expected when deleterious mutations are additive. Leveraging this unique pattern, we develop a machine learning classifier to infer dominance in genomic windows at a megabase resolution, trained on simulations of a human demographic model with Neanderthal introgression using fully recessive or additive mutations. Our method demonstrates robust accuracy at detecting genomic windows containing recessive deleterious mutations, with particularly high power in exon-dense regions. When applied to the non-African populations from the 1000 Genomes Project, we find that approximately 3-9% of the human genome is enriched for recessive mutations with most recessive regions shared across human populations. Furthermore, our method reveals that recessive deleterious mutations are not evenly distributed across the genome: regions enriched for recessive mutations are significantly depleted of haploinsufficient genes and runs of homozygosity, and are enriched with non-additive variants associated with complex traits. Overall, our Neanderthal ancestry-based approach reveals the presence of recessive deleterious mutations in the human genome and suggests that these mutations are found in regions containing genes associated with metabolism and immune-related traits.", "date": "2025-05-07", "journal": ""}
