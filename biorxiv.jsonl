Whether it shapes collective decision-making under predator threat is unknown. Here groups of six medaka (Oryzias latipes) cohabited for one month were used to test whether cohabitation promotes instantaneous collective decision-making in response to a looming stimulus (LS) mimicking a predator attack. Firstly, we analysed behavioural transitions before, during, and after LS in groups composed of six individuals. Individuals showing high-speed swimming in response to LS typically tended to shift to freezing-like behaviour afterwards, whereas non-responders were more likely to maintain normal swimming. Group-level analysis revealed a bimodal distribution in the number of individuals exhibiting freezing-like behaviour, with peaks at zero and six individuals, corresponding to 'all non-freezing' and 'all-freezing'. Importantly, clustering analysis revealed that experimental groups showed consistent collective behavioural characteristics that could be categorised into three profiles: 'all-freezing', 'all non-freezing', and 'partial freezing'. In non-cohabited groups assembled immediately before testing, the 'all-freezing' profile was absent, and the distribution in the number of individuals exhibiting freezing-like behaviour shifted to unimodal. In these groups, even at the individual level, responses more often showed a transition from high-speed swimming to normal swimming rather than freezing. The results indicate that cohabitation promotes synchronous freezing-like behaviour and consensus decisions under looming threat. Our study presents a behavioural assay for predator-evoked collective decision-making in a genetic model fish, providing a framework laying the groundwork for future efforts to link behavioural ethology with neuroscience.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

While tonic firing produces asynchronous spiking driven by diverse external inputs, collective burst firing consists of rapid clusters of spikes followed by a period of silence, happening synchronously within the network. Synaptic plasticity has typically been studied only in either one of these regimes, leaving unclear how alternating states jointly shape long-term weight dynamics. Here, we use a conductance-based network model endowed with calcium-based or spike-timing-based plasticity rules to examine how synaptic weights evolve across state transitions. During tonic firing, synaptic weights are driven by the statistics of external inputs, producing a broad distribution across the network. In contrast, during collective burst firing, weights converge to a narrow region in weight space: a burst-induced attractor. We derive the location of this attractor analytically in terms of plasticity parameters and activity statistics, and confirm its emergence across diverse plasticity rules. The attractor reflects the synchronization of plasticity-driving signals during bursts, which homogenizes synaptic dynamics and forces convergence toward shared fixed points. We further show that neuromodulation and synaptic tagging can shift or split the burst-induced attractor, stabilizing selected synapses while weakening others. This mechanism reconciles flexibility during tonic-driven learning with stability during burst-driven consolidation. These results identify burst-induced attractors as a robust emergent property of networks combining collective bursting with soft-bound plasticity rules. By showing how they can be analytically predicted and experimentally modulated, our work provides a general computational framework linking state transitions, synaptic plasticity, and memory organization.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

The network is required to have surface spin-half particles. We show that the signals thus generated carry information regarding their creation and can transfer and store this information to form memory structures in helical aligned surface spin-half particles present on the surfaces of the pathways traversed by the signals. Theoretical neuroscience is progressing strongly with novel representations of the brain, enhanced by the increase of computational power now available. New methods to explore complex brain events and the structures for storing memories as engrams are emerging. However, there are major conceptual theoretical problems that remain unaddressed. Current theoretical methods are very capable of reacting to experimental results and modelling both neural signalling and structure. Yet they still fall short to throw light on how the brain creates its own information code, or relate the variety of brain signals observed, or explain where and how memories are stored. We prove that current brain signals cannot carry information regarding their formation so that they cannot be used to understand how memories of events are related to signals. Thus our results address these basic unresolved theoretical problems of neuroscience and suggest testable solutions. The memory structures of aligned spin-half particles suggested have not been observed in biological organisms as yet they but they have been observed in solid state physics and their existence is consistent with conventional understandings of neurobiology. All the results stated follow from the dynamical law for the network.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

M.; Reppmann, Z.; Krause, F.; Hermans, E. J.", "abstract": "Physiological noise substantially affects fMRI data quality, particularly in areas near fluid-filled cavities and arteries such as the brainstem. Peripheral physiological signals can be recorded alongside fMRI and incorporated into general linear models to remove variance associated with cardiac and respiratory cycles using methods such as Retrospective Image Correction (RETROICOR). In contrast, data-driven noise reduction methods such as anatomical component correction (aCompCor) and independent component analysis based automatic removal of motion artifacts (ICA-AROMA) do not rely on additional peripheral physiological recordings. These methods have shown efficacy in correcting for motion, scanner as well as physiological artifacts. This raises the question of whether logistically demanding peripheral recordings offer added value. We therefore used nuisance regression methods based on peripherally recorded physiology (RETROICOR, heart rate, respiratory volume) as well as fMRI data itself (ICA-AROMA, aCompCor) to account for noise in a resting-state data set. Subsequently, we compared variance explained by the respective methods and improvements in temporal signal-to-noise ratio throughout different regions of interest in the brain. Consistent with prior research, RETROICOR, heart rate and respiratory volume explain significant variance throughout the brain with peaks around areas of strong cardiac pulsations. ICA-AROMA and aCompCor account for a substantial proportion of the variance explained by the methods using peripheral physiology. Nonetheless, the methods based on peripheral physiological recordings retain unique explanatory power. Analysis revealed a pattern of unreliability of ICA-AROMA to consistently identify and remove physiological noise across recordings in each participant, which is compensated by RETROICOR, heart rate and respiratory volume. This unreliability partially results from misclassifications in the noise selection models of ICA-AROMA. Our results suggest that it is advisable to additionally apply cleaning based on peripheral physiological recordings, especially when assessing inter-individual differences and areas with regionally high levels of physiological noise.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

What organizational principles in cells enable the simultaneous realization of adaptability and homeostasis? To address this question, we measure Raman scattering light from Escherichia coli cells under diverse conditions, whose spectral patterns convey their comprehensive molecular composition. We reveal that dimension-reduced Raman spectra can predict condition-dependent proteome profiles. Quantitative analysis of the Raman-proteome correspondence characterizes a low-dimensional hierarchical stoichiometry-conserving proteome structure. The network centrality of each gene in the stoichiometry conservation relations correlates with its essentiality and evolutionary conservation, and these correlations are preserved from bacteria to human cells. Furthermore, stoichiometry-conserving core components obey growth law and ensure homeostasis across conditions, whereas peripheral stoichiometry-conserving components enable adaptation to specific conditions. Mathematical analysis reveals that the stoichiometrically constrained architecture is reflected in major changes in Raman spectral patterns. These results uncover coordination of global stoichiometric balance in cells and demonstrate that vibrational spectroscopy can decipher such biological constraints beyond statistical or machine-learning inference of cellular states.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Small RNAs, 20-30 nucleotides in length, bind to PIWI proteins and guide them to nascent transcripts by sequence complementarity, triggering the recruitment of histone methyltransferase enzymes on chromatin to repress the transcriptional activity of TEs and other repeats. In the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, 25-nt scnRNAs corresponding to TEs recruit Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), and trigger their elimination during the formation of the somatic nucleus. Here, we sequenced sRNAs during the entire sexual cycle with unprecedented resolution. Our data confirmed that scnRNAs are produced from the entire germline genome, from TEs and non-TE sequences, during meiosis. Non-TE scnRNAs are selectively degraded, which results in the specific selection of TE-scnRNAs. We demonstrate that PRC2 is essential for the selective degradation of non-TE-scnRNAs, independently of its histone methyltransferase activity. We further show that the PRC2 cofactor Rf4 is required for the physical interaction between the scnRNA-binding protein Ptiwi09 and the zinc finger protein Gtsf1, pointing to an architectural role of PRC2 in scnRNA degradation.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

How the timing and integration of these signals program the epigenetic and functional fate of these cells is not completely understood. In this study, we find that interleukin (IL)-12 signaling received by innate and adaptive lymphocytes has a context-dependent role for immune memory formation. In the absence of a preceding and/or sufficient antigen receptor signaling event, IL-12 impairs the adaptive expansion of cytotoxic lymphocytes. In contrast, sufficient antigen-receptor signaling redirects inflammatory cytokine signals to promote memory differentiation via cooperation of STAT4 and AP-1 transcription factors. By this crucial epigenetic mechanism, optimally equipped lymphocytes are selected for memory formation rather than a terminal effector cell fate. Whereas T cells are hardwired to be shielded from premature IL-12 signaling, NK cells rely on coincidental early antigen receptor signaling for adaptive responses. Together, step-wise integration of antigen and cytokine signaling optimizes both effector and memory differentiation, allowing for promiscuous recruitment into the acute immune response while promoting avidity maturation in memory populations of both innate and adaptive lymphocytes.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

To investigate infection phase-specific gene expression in the pathogen, we analyzed gene expression during infection of susceptible (Taichung 29) and resistant (Veranopolis and Israel 493) wheat cultivars, plus the non-host species barley at 1, 3, 6, 10, 17 and 23 days post inoculation (DPI). There were dramatic differences in pathogen gene expression at 10 DPI in the susceptible compared to both resistant interactions. The most pronounced differences in pathogen gene expression were observed at 3 DPI in both the susceptible and resistant host interactions compared to the non-host interaction. Thirty-one putative effectors showed early expression during the susceptible interaction compared to the non-host interaction, and six effectors were selected for subcellular localization studies. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, subcellular localization assays revealed that two candidate effectors, Mycgr3109710 and Mycgr394290, localized to putative mobile cytosolic bodies when expressed without their signal peptides, suggesting potential roles in intracellular signaling or host gene regulation. When expressed with their native signal peptides, four candidate effectors localized to the cytosol, while one effector, Mycgr3107904, did not accumulate to detectable levels, as shown by immunoblot analysis, indicating degradation. Comparison of pathogen gene expression in the susceptible host to expression in the resistant hosts, allowed us to identify genes that are expressed during the transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic growth at 10 DPI. Comparison of pathogen gene expression in resistant and susceptible hosts, versus in the non-host barley, allowed us to identify genes involved in initial colonization and host recognition. In addition, our study contributes to understanding candidate effectors that are activated early during infection and may play a role in the initial suppression of plant immunity, making them strong candidates for functional characterization.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

We focus on statistical learning paradigms. These require identifying underlying regularities in seemingly arbitrary word sequences and are primarily considered to require neural plasticity. LLMs can capture arbitrary structures without requiring weight adaptation, despite divergence from their natural language training data.

Despite the longstanding dominance of target-based approaches, phenotypic virtual screening is undergoing a resurgence due to its potential being now better understood. In the context of cancer cell lines, a well-established experimental system for phenotypic screens, molecules are tested to identify their whole-cell activity, as summarized by their half-maximal inhibitory concentrations. Machine learning has emerged as a potent tool for computationally guiding such screens, yet important research gaps persist, including generalization and uncertainty quantification. To address this, we leverage a clustering-based validation approach, called Leave Dissimilar Molecules Out (LDMO). This strategy enables a more rigorous assessment of model generalization to structurally novel compounds. This study focuses on applying Conformal Prediction (CP), a model-agnostic framework, to predict the activities of novel molecules on specific cancer cell lines. A total of 4320 independent models were evaluated across 60 cell lines, 5 CP variants, 2 set features, and training-test splits, providing strong and consistent results. From this comprehensive evaluation, we concluded that, regardless of the cell line or model, novel molecules with smaller CP-calculated confidence intervals tend to have smaller predicted errors once measured activities are revealed. It was also possible to anticipate the activities of dissimilar test molecules across 50 or more cell lines. These outcomes demonstrate the robust efficacy that LDMO-based models can achieve in realistic and challenging scenarios, thereby providing valuable insights for enhancing decision-making processes in drug discovery.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Using genetic approaches and lipid reconstitution assays, we show that these ether lipid-regulated biophysical properties permit non-clathrin-mediated iron endocytosis via CD44, resulting in significant increases in intracellular redox-active iron and enhanced ferroptosis susceptibility. Using a combination of in vitro three-dimensional microvascular network systems and in vivo animal models, we show that loss of ether lipids from plasma membranes also strongly attenuates extravasation, metastatic burden and cancer stemness.

However, image quality may vary in MRI. Poor quality MR images can lead to unreliable segmentation of MTL subregions. Considering that different MRI contrast mechanisms and field strengths (jointly referred to as \"modalities\" here) offer distinct advantages in imaging different parts of the MTL, we developed a muti-modality segmentation model using both 7 tesla (7T) and 3 tesla (3T) structural MRI to obtain robust segmentation in poor-quality images. Method: MRI modalities including 3T T1-weighted, 3T T2-weighted, 7T T1-weighted and 7T T2-weighted (7T-T2w) of 197 participants were collected from a longitudinal aging study at the Penn Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Among them, 7T-T2w was used as the primary modality, and all other modalities were rigidly registered to the 7T-T2w. A model derived from nnU-Net took these registered modalities as input and outputted subregion segmentation in 7T-T2w space. 7T-T2w images most of which had high quality from 25 selected training participants were manually segmented to train the multi-modality model. Modality augmentation, which randomly replaced certain modalities with Gaussian noise, was applied during training to guide the model to extract information from all modalities. To compare our proposed model with a baseline single-modality model in the full dataset with mixed high/poor image quality, we evaluated the ability of derived volume/thickness measures to discriminate Amyloid+ mild cognitive impairment (A+MCI) and Amyloid- cognitively unimpaired (A-CU) groups, as well as the stability of these measurements in longitudinal data. Results: The multi-modality model delivered good performance regardless of 7T-T2w quality, while the single-modality model under-segmented subregions in poor-quality images. The multi-modality model generally demonstrated stronger discrimination of A+MCI versus A-CU. Intra-class correlation and Bland-Altman plots demonstrate that the multi-modality model had higher longitudinal segmentation consistency in all subregions while the single-modality model had low consistency in poor-quality images. Conclusion: The multi-modality MRI segmentation model provides an improved biomarker for neurodegeneration in the MTL that is robust to image quality. It also provides a framework for other studies which may benefit from multimodal imaging.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

VASCilia includes five deep learning-based models that streamline the analysis process, including: (1) Z-Focus Tracker (ZFT) for selecting relevant slices in a 3D image stack; (2) PCPAlignNet (Planar Cell Polarity Alignment Network) for automated orientation of image stacks; (3) a segmentation model for identifying and delineating stereocilia bundles; (4) a tonotopic Position Prediction tool; and (5) a classification tool for identifying hair cell subtypes.

Using VASCilia, we demonstrate its utility on challenging datasets, including neonatal wildtype and Eps8 KO 5-day old mice), revealing that total actin content does not necessarily scale with bundle height. We further showcase its power by quantifying complex bundle disorganization in Cdh23-/- cochleae via texture analysis, which revealed systematically more heterogeneous and less regular bundles than in controls. These novel biological findings demonstrate the power of VASCilia in facilitating detailed quantitative analysis of stereocilia. VASCilia also provides a user-friendly interface that allows researchers to easily navigate and use the tool, with the added capability to reload all their analyses for review or sharing purposes.

Biochemical, physiological, and structural analyses revealed that specialized Bacteroidota employ a four-enzyme pathway to metabolize this mannan. Metagenomic and transcriptomic data indicate that the mannan globally selects for bacteria carrying these enzymes and associated traits.

Inferring illness causes, relative to all control conditions, selectively engaged a portion of the precuneus (PC) previously implicated in the semantic representation of animates (e.g., people, animals). Neural responses to causal inferences about illness were adjacent to but distinct from responses to mental state inferences, suggesting a neural mind/body distinction. We failed to find evidence for domain-general responses to causal inference. Implicit causal inferences are supported by content-specific semantic networks that encode causal knowledge.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Despite its significant importance in crop breeding, the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis remain debated, mainly attributable to discrepancies across genotypes, traits, tissues, populations, developmental stages, growth environments, and species. In this study, we systematically identified heterosis-associated genes and metabolites derived from parental molecular differences for seedling length in rice and incorporated them into network modules to explain the variance of heterosis. The predominant inheritance patterns of these heterosis-associated molecules were additive and partially dominant effects, namely at mid-parent levels or values between mid-parent and parental levels, respectively. These two genetic effects contributed to heterosis of 17 agronomic traits in rice, including grain yield and plant height across four developmental stages. They also explained yield heterosis in diverse hybrid populations and distinct growth environments in both rice and maize, as well as biomass heterosis in Arabidopsis. Notably, additive and partially dominant effects were associated with parental genomic variants in rice, and the number of these variants correlated significantly with heterosis of agronomic traits. Furthermore, we demonstrated the significant impact of parental genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic variation in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis on heterosis for seedling length/plant height. Unlike classical heterosis models primarily focused on genomic sequence variation, our findings provide quantitative insights from genomic downstream information into the molecular mechanisms of plant heterosis, highlighting their potential for improving breeding efficiency of hybrid crops.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with multiple human populations have uncovered single nucleotide variants of the CD2AP gene locus that are associated with Alzheimers Disease (AD) risk. However, the role of CD2AP in AD pathogenesis remains unknown. In adult PNS neurons, previous work demonstrated that CD2AP functions as a docking-scaffold/adaptor protein coordinator of nerve growth factor (NGF) trophic signaling and RAB5-mediated endocytosis. In the adult CNS, whereas CD2AP is robustly expressed in non-neuronal cells and neurovasculature, neuronal expression is restricted and poorly characterized. In this study using publicly available single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing, we observed that CD2AP mRNA is enriched in a population of TrkA-expressing cholinergic neurons of the adult mouse basal forebrain. Immunohistology using brain tissue from adult choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) GFP reporter mice, confirmed enrichment of CD2AP protein in cholinergic projections, and in neuron soma in the diagonal band of Broca where it co-localized with RAB5. Together with previous studies from NGF-responsive PNS primary sensory neurons, these observations indicate that CD2AP may play a role in retrograde trophic signaling in NGF-responsive CNS cholinergic neurons. In addition, we observed that CD2AP expression in these soma was increased in aged mice (18-month-old), concomitant with a reduction of co-localization with RAB5, suggesting a potential role for CD2AP in aging-associated changes in retrograde trophic signaling in these neurons. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons project to the hippocampus and cortex, are required for learning and memory, are critical for brain health during aging, and disruption of RAB5 mediated endocytosis in these neurons is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). Future studies are therefore warranted to determine if CD2AP risk variants impact endocytosis and trophic signaling in cholinergic neurons in healthy aging and/or AD.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Relative rates are assumed to be distributed according to a discretised Gamma distribution, where the probabilities that a site is included in each class are equal. Here, we identify a serious bias in the branch lengths of reconstructed phylogenies when the DGM is used, with the magnitude of the effect varying with the number of sequences in the alignment. We demonstrate the existence of the bias in both simulated dataset and using real HIV-1 sequences; in both cases branch lengths are overestimated. We show that the alternative \"FreeRate\" model, which assumes no parametric distribution and allows the class probabilities to vary, is not subject to the issue. We further establish that the reason for the behaviour is the equal class probabilities, not the discretisation itself. We explore the mathematics of for the phenomenon, showing how maximum likelihood branch lengths under the DGM may differ from the true ones used to generate the tree, and that branch lengths will be overestimated where there is a long-tail of fast-evolving sites in the true rate distribution, which is the usual situation in real datasets. We recommend that the DGM be retired from general use. While FreeRate is an immediately available replacement, it is known to be difficult to fit, and thus there is scope for innovation in rate heterogeneity models.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

The vast combinatorial space of possible perturbations and responses makes exhaustive experimentation infeasible. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that training on diverse datasets enables transfer learning across tasks, capturing patterns that generalize and improving performance on previously unseen problems. Inspired by this principle, we present Prophet, a transformer-based model pretrained on a vast, heterogeneous collection of perturbation experiments. This pretraining allows Prophet to predict the outcomes of untested genetic or chemical perturbations in novel cellular contexts, spanning phenotypes such as gene expression, viability, and morphology. By leveraging shared structure across apparently disconnected assays, Prophet provides a scalable framework for large-scale virtual screening and prioritization of informative experiments. Prophet consistently outperforms baseline models, including those trained on single phenotypes, showing that transfer learning between phenotypes not only is possible but improves predictive accuracy. Its capabilities extends to in vivo developmental systems, where it recapitulates known lineage biology and proposes new candidates.

Ninety-nine percent of individuals with BLBS show developmental delay/intellectual disability, but the mechanism by which variants in H3.3 result in these phenotypes is not yet understood, limiting the therapeutic interventions available to individuals living with BLBS. Methods Here, we investigate how one BLBS-causative variant, H3-3B p.Leu48Arg (L48R), affects neurodevelopment using an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model differentiated to 2D neural progenitor cells (NPCs), 2D forebrain neurons (FBNs), and 3D dorsal forebrain organoids (DFBOs). We employ a multi-omic approach in the 2D models to quantify the resulting changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. We used immunofluorescence (IF) staining to define the identities of cells in the 3D DFBO and whole-cell patch clamp to investigate the electrophysiological properties of neurons in DFBOs. Results In the 2D systems, we found dysregulated gene expression and chromatin accessibility affecting neuronal fate, adhesion, neurotransmission, and excitatory/inhibitory balance. Immunofluorescence of DFBOs corroborated altered proportions of radial glia and mature neuronal populations. Patch clamp recordings revealed decreased electrical activity in neurons from L48R DFBOs compared to control DFBOs. Conclusions These data provide the first mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of BLBS from a human-derived model of neurodevelopment, which suggest that H3.3 L48R increases H3-3B expression, resulting in the hyper-deposition of H3.3 into the nucleosome which underlies changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Functionally, this causes dysregulation of cell adhesion, neurotransmission, and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling.

During planning, different levels of speech units are coded discretely at distinct prefrontal sites. These planned units are then dynamically integrated at various cortical levels to guide subsequent execution. During speech execution, speech motor regions generate continuous sequences that reflect both discrete speech sound units and their transitional properties between units.

However, developing elite hybrids remains a laborious and time-consuming process. The genetic basis of heterosis has been debated for over a century, hindered largely by the lack of high-quality genomes. Here, we assembled genomes for 12 representative indica and japonica rice accessions. Using sequence variants of the Phr1 gene, we functionally validated two deletions responsible for phenol reaction variation between the subspecies. Comparative genomic analyses revealed extensive sequence variation among these inbred lines and highlighted the pivotal role of structural variants (SVs) in rice subspeciation. Importantly, the number of SVs between parental inbred lines significantly correlated with heterosis across 17 agronomic traits, with distinct correlation patterns for intra- and inter-subspecific F1 hybrids. We identified SVs associated with S5-ORF5 and OsBZR1 and validated their function to heterosis for seed setting rate and yield heterosis, respectively, underscoring the importance of SVs in breeding inter-subspecific hybrids. The genomic SVs altered gene expression and these transcriptional changes effectively explained the variances in heterosis. Furthermore, translocations outperformed other SVs and their heterozygous haplotypes exhibited heterosis over homozygous ones.

Mangroves, seagrass meadows and saltmarshes contribute to carbon sequestration not only through their photosynthetic activity but also by anchoring sediments with their extensive root systems. By modulating flow coastal vegetation creates a low energy environment for sediment that includes carbon to accumulate. These roots physically stabilize the sediment, prevent erosion and enhance long-term retention of organic carbon. Hence, we hypothesized marine, algae derived organic matter may especially accumulate in plant vegetated ecosystems. We used algal and plant glycans as carbon sequestration proxy to trace the input and stabilization from source to sink and found those molecules in 93 sediment cores across different coastal vegetated ecosystems from temperate to tropical regions. Specific monoclonal antibodies showed algal-derived fucoidans were present in sediments of coastal vegetated ecosystems.

The manner in which membrane tension propagates away from the stimulus into the membrane reservoir has emerged as a key property in cellular adaptation, mechanotransduction, and thus organismal physiology. However, it remains unclear whether tension propagation in membranes is actively regulated or is a passive property and how it depends on the cell type. Here, we combined membrane nanorheology with time-shared optical traps and mathematical modeling to investigate plasma membrane tension propagation in cultured Caenorhabditis elegans mechanosensory neurons using a dual tether extrusion assay. Our results showed that, surprisingly, the propagation of tension was restricted to ~30 m in the neurites and traveled quickly, at speeds exceeding 120 m/s. Although membrane lipid properties had minimal impact, tension propagation strongly relied on the intact actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. In particular, the organization of the /{beta} spectrin network and the MEC-2 stomatin condensates acted as barriers, limiting the spread of tension. A biophysical model for tension propagation suggests that obstacle density and arrangement play a key role in controlling the propagation of mechanical information. Our findings suggest that restricting membrane tension propagation in space and time enables precise localized signaling.

Yet, in many cases, concrete, sensory signals of past information must be transformed into the abstract codes to guide future cognition. However, this process remains poorly understood. Here, human participants used WM to maintain a separate spatial location in each hemifield wherein locations were embedded in a learned spatial sequence. On each trial, participants made a sequence-match decision to a probe and then updated their WM with the probe. The same abstract sequence guided judgments in each hemifield, allowing the separate detection of concrete spatial locations (hemifield-specific) and abstract sequence positions (hemifield-general), and also tracking of representations of the past (last location/position) and future (next location/position). Consistent with previous reports, concrete past locations held in WM could be decoded from VC and IPS. Moreover, in anticipation of the probe, representations shifted from past to future locations in both areas.

The wealth of sequence data available on ICs from diverse organisms provides a valuable source of untapped information for illuminating the unique modes of channel regulation and functional specialization.

We employ a well-established orthology inference approach to identify and extend the IC orthologs across diverse organisms to above 48,000.

Reduced GLP-1+ cells in ClpP{Delta}IEC mice and inhibition of respiration in organoid cultures supports a causative role for metabolism in steering differentiation Conclusion Reduction of GLP-1+ cells represents a general feature of ileal and colonic inflammation in mice and human. Given the numerous properties of GLP-1, this reduction likely affects inflammatory processes in the mucosa and disease-related symptoms on multiple levels, and therefore, should be considered a therapeutic target in IBD.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Traditionally, these components are identified as the independent and correlated fluctuations between identical gene copies within the same cell. However, intrinsic gene-gene interactions can introduce additional correlations, challenging this standard approach. Here, we develop a new noise decomposition framework based on a theoretical model of stochastic transcription for an intrinsically coupled gene pair under fluctuating environments. By analytically deriving correlated fluctuations of nascent RNA, we disentangle intrinsic coupling from extrinsic noise based on their distinct relationships with the mean and variance of gene activation probabilities across varying environments. Applying this framework to single-cell transcription data from Drosophila embryos, we uncover previously unidentified couplings between sister alleles and between alternative promoters of an endogenous gene. Our findings offer a versatile approach for deciphering intrinsic gene-gene interactions in stochastic transcription within fluctuating environments.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

How the brain overcomes interference between sensory input and working memory representations remains largely unknown. To formalize the solution space, we examined recurrent neural networks that were either hand-designed or trained using gradient descent methods, and compared these models with neural data from two different macaque experiments. Here we report mechanisms by which neural networks overcome sensory-memory interference using both static and dynamic coding strategies: gating of the sensory inputs, modulating synapse strengths to achieve a strong attractor solution, and dynamic strategies - including the extreme solution in which cells invert their feature preference during working memory. Neural data from the medial superior temporal (MST) area of macaques, where sensory and working memory signals first interact along the dorsal pathway, best aligned with a solution that combined input gating and tuning inversion. Behavioral predictions from this model also matched error patterns observed in monkeys performing a working memory task with distractors. Taken together, our results help elucidate how working memory circuits preserve information as we continue to interact with the world, and suggest intermediate cortical visual areas like MST may play a critical role in this computation.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Support for this idea in early sensory areas comes from studies involving repeated exposure and explicit recall instructions. In everyday life, however, people often remember details from single events without repeated practice or instruction. We used fMRI to test whether memory responses emerge in early visual cortex after a single encoding event. Twenty adults viewed objects presented once in one of four parafoveal locations, then later completed recognition (old/new) and location recall tasks in which objects were shown foveally. We observed low amplitude responses in V1 to V3 during both memory tasks. These responses were tuned to the encoded parafoveal location, even though the recognition task did not ask the participant to remember the encoded location. These responses were more robust and precise for successfully remembered items, linking neural tuning in early visual cortex to one-shot memory performance. Our findings demonstrate that early visual cortex supports the defining property of episodic memory, the ability to retrieve sensory details from a single event.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Background: Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease remains a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Salmonella Typhimurium is responsible for the majority of cases, with specific lineages being associated with increased risk of bloodstream infection. We have recently developed a Salmonella Typhimurium controlled human infection model (CHIM) to better understand disease pathogenesis and to provide a platform to test candidate vaccines. Selecting appropriate challenge strains is a central design consideration in developing challenge model protocols. We describe the rationale, manufacture, and detailed characterisation of the two Salmonella Typhimurium strains used in the first-in-human NTS CHIM. Methods: Two Salmonella Typhimurium strains, 4/74 (ST19) and D23580 (ST313), were selected from the UK Health Security Agency National Collection of Type Cultures and manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions. Challenge agent stocks underwent microbial limits testing, viability and stability assessments, and phenotypic characterisation including growth kinetics, motility, acid sensitivity, and antibiotic susceptibility. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to confirm genetic stability post-manufacture. The effect of pre-challenge handling conditions was assessed in saline and sodium bicarbonate buffers, and bacterial survival was evaluated under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions using a modified Rossett-Rice model. Transcriptomic profiling was undertaken to determine whether sodium bicarbonate exposure altered expression of key virulence genes. Results: Both strains retained their expected phenotypic characteristics, including reduced motility and melibiose utilisation in D23580. GMP stocks remained pure, viable, and stable post-manufacture, with no unexpected genomic mutations detected. Both strains were susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics used in the study. Survival was maintained in neutral and mildly acidic conditions, with significant reduction below pH 3.5. Stability was preserved for up to one hour in saline buffer and during simulated gastric transit in the Rossett-Rice model. Transcriptomic analysis showed no significant changes in Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 or 2, or flagellar gene expression following sodium bicarbonate exposure Conclusions: These findings confirm that the Salmonella Typhimurium 4/74 and D23580 strains retained genomic and phenotypic integrity post-manufacture. The resulting challenge stocks provide the foundation for an ongoing NTS CHIM that aims to advance understanding of NTS and iNTS pathogenesis and support candidate vaccine testing.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

PEtab Select addresses this challenge by providing a concise, standardized specification of model selection and its associated calibration problems through a new file format standard and software package. The standard facilitates the compact representation of even very large model selection problems; in one example, billions of model alternatives. PEtab Select builds on the PEtab standard for the specification of parameter estimation problems, and enables the use of state-of-the-art modelling and calibration workflows utilizing COPASI, Data2Dynamics, PEtab.jl, and pyPESTO. PEtab Select supports common model selection criteria (e.g., Akaike and Bayesian information criteria) and can be easily extended to use others. To ensure flexibility, PEtab Select implements several model space exploration approaches, including basic brute-force, forward, and backward selection, and also advanced, flexible selection methods.

The local breed populations are highly adapted to specific environments in the United Kingdom and these and other rare breeds provide solutions to niche needs. Rare breeds often contribute more than expected to overall species genetic diversity, which is important because genetic variation is needed for adapting to new challenges. It is therefore very important from both United Kingdom and global perspectives to maintain genetic diversity of rare livestock breeds in the United Kingdom, and to do this, we need to evaluate the monitoring of genetic diversity to identify gaps in our knowledge and prioritise resources reserved for conservation purposes. The objectives of this study were to survey the literature to: (1) summarise genetic/genomic characterisation (effective population size (Ne) and inbreeding) of domestic populations (livestock and equine) in the United Kingdom and Ireland; (2) compare number of populations on the United Kingdom's Rare Breeds Survival Trust watch list and the number of United Kingdom and Irish populations in the peer-reviewed literature with inbreeding, genetic diversity and/or Ne estimates; and (3) compare annually reported (census-based) estimates of Ne with (inbreeding- and DNA-based) estimates from peer-reviewed literature. We found a total of 37 publications with Ne or inbreeding estimates for United Kingdom or Ireland livestock populations, published from 1975 to 2024. While many (42%) of the breeds on the Rare Breeds Survival Trust watchlist have been included in publications, there are still many breeds, and a few species (turkey, duck and geese) with no publicly available pedigree- or DNA-based genetic diversity measures. We found census-based Ne estimates were, on average, higher than DNA-based estimates, likely due to violated assumptions when estimating Ne with census-based data because of the way livestock mating systems are designed. Most peer-reviewed papers estimated genetic diversity measures using pedigree, microsatellite markers, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers. To identify breed-unique variants responsible for adaptive traits in rare breeds, more studies using whole-genome sequencing will be needed.

Here, we investigated the evolutionary history of multifocal and unifocal SI-NET using whole genome sequencing data, obtaining timing information on primary tumors, metastases and key genetic events. Despite the late onset, the results indicated that major genetic alterations and the establishment of advanced metastatic tumor cell clones can often be traced back to childhood or adolescence in SI-NET. This was validated by re-examination of archival CT/MR scans, allowing longitudinal tracking of individual tumors up to 12 years prior. Metastases were detected at a high degree of consistency in the historical imaging data and estimated growth rates suggested several additional decades of tumor expansion. Collectively, our data support that slow growth of advanced lesions over half a century or more may precede SI-NET diagnosis in late adulthood.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

This study reveals that Spn-derived H2O2, primarily produced by pyruvate oxidase (SpxB), inhibits the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in lung epithelial cells by targeting aconitase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. This inhibition leads to citrate accumulation and reduced NADH production for oxidative phosphorylation, while RNA sequencing shows SpxB-dependent upregulation of glycolytic genes (e.g., HK2, PFKP), limiting pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle. Consequently, glucose consumption and lactate/acetate production increase, resembling a Warburg-like metabolic shift that may support bacterial survival. Despite TCA cycle suppression, mitochondrial membrane potential remains largely unaffected, with minimal apoptosis induced by Spn-mediated stress. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which Spn manipulates host metabolism to facilitate infection, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for pneumococcal diseases.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

While many theoretical studies have focused on understanding the consequences of coevolutionary cycling for the evolution of sex and recombination, little is known about the impact of coevolutionary cycling on the evolution of other life history traits. It is therefore currently unknown how coevolutionary cycling in allele frequencies affects the evolution of key disease characteristics, such as virulence. Here, we combine population genetic and quantitative genetic approaches to theoretically determine the impacts of coevolutionary cycling in allele frequencies on the evolution of virulence in a free-living parasite. By varying the level of genetic specificity required for infection while controlling for the average infection rate, we induce coevolutionary cycles and examine their effects on virulence evolution. We show that coevolutionary cycling does indeed have a strong impact on virulence evolution, with more specific infection genetics and higher allelic diversity generally driving larger and more rapid cycles in allele frequencies, leading to selection for higher virulence. Our research provides new fundamental insights into the relationship between coevolutionary cycling and the evolution of virulence.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Aim: We aim to evaluate and compare methods of SC regression as implemented in the most widely used fNIRS analysis toolboxes, with the goal of reaching a consensus on best practices for incorporating SC into generalized linear model (GLM)-based analyses. Specifically, we compared eight SC regression strategies addressing anatomical specificity, dimensionality reduction strategies, and SC availability. Approach: 16 healthy adults passively listened and watched ecological auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli while occipital and bilateral auditory cortices were recorded. Results: Oxygenated hemoglobin signals (HbO) processed without SC regression produced uninterpretable results. SC regression methods that pooled all available SC signals without spatial constraints consistently outperformed anatomically restricted approaches. Orthogonalization further enhanced performance by reducing redundancy and capturing shared systemic variance, improving detection of stimulus-specific cortical responses and contrast sensitivity. Deoxygenated hemoglobin signals (HbR), while less sensitive to systemic artifacts than HbO, benefited most, similarly to HbO, from the pooled, orthogonalized SC signal approach. Conclusion: Overall, our findings highlight the essential role of SC regression in recovering physiologically meaningful signals in fNIRS and recommend including all available SC channels within the GLM, coupled with orthogonalization techniques, as a generalizable best practice for denoising across diverse experimental designs and hardware configurations.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Additionally, while machine learning can be used to identify key microbial and metabolic features, the stability of feature selection across models and data types remains underexplored, despite its importance for downstream experimental validation and biomarker discovery.

Here, we show that fasting and caloric restriction, two forms of dietary restriction, induce transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding CYP11A1, CYP17A1, and 17{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family enzymes, promoting ADIOL biosynthesis. ADIOL, in turn, acts on the nervous system to reduce levels of kynurenic acid, a neuroactive metabolite linked to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. This effect requires NHR-91, the C. elegans homolog of estrogen receptor {beta}, specifically in the RIM neuron, a key site of kynurenic acid production. Consistent with the known benefits of fasting and caloric restriction on healthspan, enhancing ADIOL signaling improves multiple healthspan indicators during aging. Conversely, animals deficient in ADIOL signaling exhibit reduced healthspan under normal conditions and in genetic models of caloric restriction, underscoring the functional significance of this pathway. Notably, ADIOL does not significantly impact lifespan, indicating that its healthspan benefits are not simply a byproduct of lifespan extension. Together, these findings establish a physiological role for ADIOL in mediating the neuroprotective and pro-healthspan effects of fasting and caloric restriction and suggest that boosting ADIOL signaling may help narrow the gap between lifespan and healthspan. This positions ADIOL as a promising mimetic of dietary restriction effects on healthspan that could be used as a therapeutic strategy for age-related neurodegenerative conditions.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Epidemiological studies indicate that lifestyle and environmental exposures may result in chronic inflammation, which is known to trigger tissue fibrosis. This study tests the hypothesis that fibrotic remodeling and biomechanical stiffening of colorectal tissues represent measurable hallmarks and potential drivers of EO CRC. Using primary human tissues, this work shows that EO CRC is associated with changes in collagen microstructure, increased stiffness and elevated viscosity of primary tumors. Spatial transcriptional profiling and immunostaining reveal pro-fibrotic signatures in stromal cells, alongside enhanced Yes-associated protein (YAP) mechanotransduction and proliferation in epithelial cells of EO CRC tissues.

A key difficulty lies in reconstructing the codon landscape of the target expression system within a foreign host with a native-like codon preference. To address this, we present TransCodon, a Transformer-based deep learning model that leverages both 5` untranslated regions (5`UTRs) and coding sequences (CDS), along with explicit species identifiers and RNA secondary structure information, to learn nuanced codon usage patterns across diverse organisms. By incorporating multisource genomic data and modeling sequence dependencies in a masked language modeling paradigm, TransCodon effectively captures both local and global determinants of codon preference. Our experiments demonstrate that integrating species-level information during training significantly improves the model`s ability to predict optimal synonymous codons when considering different evaluation metrics. More importantly it identifies native-like codons with less divergence from natural sequences compared to other methods.

Treatment with SRT leads to lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, thereby activating the cholesterol-sensing transcription factor SREBP2 and increasing biosynthetic cholesterol flux in macrophages. In addition, this buildup of cholesterol induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), mitochondrial ROS production, and downstream NLRP3 inflammasome activation, contributing to enhanced macrophage-mediated bacterial killing.

Despite the diversity of cortical regions and thereby supported tasks, we identify two fundamental computations that explain neural activity across visual cortex: object and appearance-free motion recognition. Strikingly, a single objective underlies both: these inherent computations in the brain emerge from optimising for understanding world dynamics, and their arrangement is highly distributed and smooth across cortex rather than strictly aligning with the two visual streams.

Starting as the EMA granule, Visham distributes asymmetrically in cyst cells along with Pard3, and enriches in future oocytes. Transient spindle remnants containing stable acetylated microtubules link early cyst cells; a gap in these microtubules beginning at the 8-cell stage suggests cysts are programmed to fragment into six-cell groups. Visham also acts during meiosis to mediate Pard3-dependent polarity, Xbp1-dependent adaptive UPR, and organelle rejuvenation. In Dazl mutants, cysts still form, but normal Visham behavior, polarity, rejuvenation and oocyte production are blocked.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

M.; Humphries, K. M.; Beckstead, M. J.", "abstract": "A growing body of work has recently linked ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron dysfunction to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Work in AD mouse models suggests that VTA dopamine neurons are intrinsically hyperexcitable, yet release less dopamine and exhibit disrupted downstream signaling. Significant focus has been placed on describing dopamine release in projection regions; however, dopamine neurons somatodendritically integrate vast synaptic input, altering action potential output and ultimately determining neurotransmitter release. Synaptic transmission is broadly disrupted in AD, but it is not known to what extent excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the VTA are altered. Here we describe enhanced synaptic excitation in dopamine neurons in the amyloid + tau-driven 3xTg-AD mouse model. Patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments revealed enhanced AMPAR-mediated excitatory input in a subset of perisomatic connections. In contrast, GABAAR-mediated inhibition was decreased as a function of dendritic atrophy, determined by single neuron reconstructions. We also detected elevated protein kinase C (PKC) substrate levels in the midbrain, and pharmacological experiments suggested that the strengthened excitation depends on elevated PKC activity. Additionally, postsynaptic AMPA receptor conductance was enhanced and displayed diminished ability to induce plasticity (long-term depression), but this was not dependent upon increased AMPA receptor expression. Morphologically detailed biophysical modeling predicted that synaptic changes, in combination with altered dendritic morphology and intrinsic hypersensitivity, produce increased spontaneous firing rates and a steeper input-output relationship in 3xTg-AD neurons. The results argue against a uniform decrease in synaptic connectivity across the brain in AD, and sheds light on the involvement of deep brain circuits. AD pathology is therefore associated with increased sensitivity of single dopamine neurons, which may help to maintain phasic dopamine signaling in early stages of degeneration.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized HDGECs with depression history would show accelerated grey matter atrophy and disinhibition of striatal-to-default mode network connections over time. Methods The study utilised the largest longitudinal study of premanifest HD, TrackOn-HD, including structural and resting-state brain scans. HDGECs were stratified by depression history and followed over three annual assessments. Analyses focused on 8 predefined regions spanning striatal and default mode network regions. Here, we applied spectral dynamic causal modelling to examine effective connectivity, alongside voxel-based morphometry of grey matter atrophy and linear mixed models of depressive symptoms. Spectral DCM employed Bayesian model reduction with free energy thresholds [&ge;]0.95 for strong evidence of connectivity changes. Results The study included 105 HDGECs (53 females, mean age = 43, mean CAG = 43). Depression-related network dysconnection operated independently of regional grey matter atrophy, with HDGECs exhibiting widespread striatal volume loss but no differential atrophy patterns between depression groups. Larger posterior cingulate cortex volumes predicted increased depression severity specifically in HDGECs with depression history, across both Beck Depression Inventory-II ({beta} = 36.79, 95% CI = 2.33-71.25, p = .041) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression Subscale ({beta} = 27.31, 95% CI = 11.12-43.50, p = .002). Spectral dynamic causal models explained 88.6% of variance in depression groups and 90.4% in non-depression groups. Longitudinal effective connectivity analyses revealed distinct dysconnection profiles: HDGECs with depression history showed widespread interhemispheric alterations including progressive inhibitory changes of striatal-DMN circuits and aberrant hippocampal regulatory control, while those without depression exhibited more focal dysconnection. These patterns occurred despite no group differences in grey matter atrophy trajectories over 24 months. Discussion Depression in HDGECs emerges through network dysconnection that operates independently of regional atrophy. Functional alterations may precede detectable structural breakdown and represent pathological responses to subclinical neurodegenerative processes, suggesting functional connectivity markers may serve as early indicators of depression vulnerability in premanifest HD.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

F.; Coughlan, J. M.", "abstract": "Postzygotic reproductive isolation is often thought to accumulate as a byproduct of neutral divergence. Yet, it frequently evolves rapidly, in line with non-neutral evolution. A major driver of intrinsic postzygotic reproductive barriers are intragenomic conflicts, such as conflict between maternal and paternal interests in resource allocation to offspring (i.e., parental conflict). Parental conflict may underlie hybrid seed inviability, a common and rapidly evolving reproductive barrier in angiosperms. Yet, in closely related, hybridizing species, it remains unclear how intragenomic conflicts and introgression interact to determine the fate of incompatibility alleles in nature. Here, we explore repeated incidences of hybrid seed inviability in a rising model: the Mimulus guttatus species complex. Using an extensive, range-wide crossing survey, we discover patterns of hybrid seed inviability within the widespread M. guttatus that are better described by geography than phylogeny. These patterns of reproductive isolation transgress species boundaries, as geographically-proximate but phylogenetically-distant species also exhibit similar patterns of hybrid seed inviability with allopatric populations of M. guttatus. We find strong support that patterns of reproductive isolation are consistent with parental conflict. Lastly, we provide evidence that introgression may underlie shared patterns of hybrid seed inviability between two species within this complex. Such introgression could have led to cascading reproductive isolation with other closely related species, creating a complex landscape of incompatibility. Overall, this work suggests that parental conflict and introgression can interact to shape the rapid and repeated evolution of strong reproductive isolation in the wild.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Although proliferative and differentiating tissues exhibit markedly different cell cycle dynamics, how these differences shape the histone modification landscape in vivo remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that levels of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 are tightly linked to cell cycle dynamics in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. We demonstrate that both physiological and pathological elongation of the cell cycle led to an accumulation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, whereas cell cycle acceleration reduces their levels. In contrast, H3K27ac exhibits the opposite pattern: levels decrease in arrested cells and increase with faster cycling. Genome-wide CUT&Tag analysis reveals that these changes predominantly affect genomic loci already modified in normally proliferating tissue. Importantly, the regulation of methylation levels at H3K9 and H3K27 is not solely mediated by the cell cycle machinery but reflects a metabolically guided process in which the rate of methylation is coupled to the rate of cell proliferation through metabolic activity, including signaling via the Insulin/PI3K/Akt pathway. Our study thus reveals key principles for understanding histone methylation in proliferating, senescent, and differentiating cells. In contrast, H3K27 acetylation is regulated through a distinct, cell cycle-coupled mechanism. We find that CBP/Nejire-mediated acetylation of H3K27 peaks during S-phase and is reversed by HDAC1, as cells exit replication. Disruption of this acetylation cycle leads to replication stress and a G2 cell cycle arrest via a DNA damage checkpoint. Notably, this genome-protective function of CBP/Nejire depends specifically on acetylation of the H3K27 residue itself, revealing a novel role for H3K27ac beyond its well-established function in transcriptional activation. Together, our findings establish a robust link between cell cycle progression and histone modification dynamics, highlighting the necessity of maintaining balanced PTM levels under varying proliferative states.

M.; Gu, Y.; Ye, M.; Barroga, F.; Evans, S. M.; Zhou, X.; Chen, J.", "abstract": "BACKGROUNDActivating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) functions as a transcriptional regulator in various cell types and tissues under both physiological and pathological conditions. While previous studies have linked ATF4 activation with promoting cardiomyocyte (CM) death in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, its role in developing CMs remains unexplored.\n\nMETHODSWe generated multiple distinct CM-specific (Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) and Atf4cKO(e2)) and global Atf4 knockout (Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins) mouse models targeting different Atf4 regions, as well as cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 to study cardiac phenotypes. Detailed morphological and molecular analyses were performed.\n\nRESULTSAtf4cKO(e2/3/pA) (targeting exon 2-3 including the polyadenylation signal (polyA)) mice exhibited severe cardiac defects and died before E17.5, likely due to ectopic activation of p53 signaling pathway resulting from Rps19bp1 downregulation, a potent suppressor of p53. Further investigation revealed that deleting the polyA signal of Atf4 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice led to transcriptional readthrough, resulting in the formation of an Atf4-Cacna1i fusion transcript and Rps19bp1 downregulation. To avoid readthrough while abolishing ATF4 function, we introduced small indels into exon 3 of Atf4 in mice (Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins), which showed normal Rps19bp1 expression and cardiac morphology. Importantly, CM-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 recapitulated the cardiac defects and transcriptional change seen in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA)mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWe found that the downregulation of Rps19bp1, not loss of ATF4 function, underlying the cardiac phenotypes in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice. The reduced expression of Rps19bp1 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice is likely due to the unintentional deletion of Atf4 polyA signal and subsequent transcriptional readthrough, underscoring the essential role of RPS19BP1, not ATF4, in cardiac development. Consistent Rps19bp1 downregulation has been observed in other tissue-specific Atf4 knockout models utilizing the Atf4fl(e2/3/pA) allele, suggesting that previously reported Atf4 KO phenotypes may result from Atf4 transcriptional readthrough effects. These findings reveal a locus-dependent transcriptional interference mechanism and emphasize the importance of avoiding confounding cis effects in genetically engineered models.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVEOur findings clarify ATF4s role in heart development by showing that cardiac defects in cardiomyocyte-specific ATF4 knockout mice--using a widely employed floxed ATF4 line--result from unintended downregulation of RPS19BP1 caused by transcriptional readthrough. This shifts the focus from ATF4 to RPS19BP1, a key regulator of p53 activity, as a potential driver of cardiac developmental abnormalities. Clinically, these insights caution against misinterpretation of genetic knockout models and highlight RPS19BP1 as a promising target for congenital heart disease and related cardiac dysfunctions, with potential implications for future therapies.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

We reveal an unsuspected role for PRDM1 (BLIMP1), a plasma-cell determinant, as a feedback regulator of affinity maturation. Single cell RNA-seq and BCR-seq showed that B-cell-specific Prdm1 loss drives an exaggerated GC reaction with larger clones, increased somatic hypermutation, and greater clonal dominance, independent of Nr4a1. Single cell chromatin profiling with base-resolution modelling indicated that PRDM1 represses expression of BCR-signaling genes and gates chromatin accessibility at ISRE, EICE, NF-KB, and POU (Oct) motifs. In the absence of PRDM1, enhanced engagement of signaling-inducible transcription factors promotes G1-S transition during light-zone (LZ) selection and fuels dark-zone (DZ) expansion. Thus, PRDM1 attenuates BCR signaling and constrains the LZ-DZ transition, fine-tuning clonal competition thereby maintaining repertoire diversity.

Our study aims to determine the specific clinical significance of SOR across diverse child samples and establish whether SOR is associated with distinct patterns of functional connectivity (FC). We analyzed data from 15,728 children (ages 6-17.9 years) across five datasets: three community samples, including the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD] and Healthy Brain Network [HBN] studies, and two autism-enriched samples. Bivariate and multivariate models examined associations between SOR and symptoms of anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder, as well as autistic traits. Analysis of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from the ABCD study tested brain-wide and circuit-specific FC correlates of mild SOR, replication of effects in an independent ABCD subsample, as well as extension to severe SOR in ABCD. Multivariate analyses revealed that SOR is associated with a remarkably consistent transdiagnostic profile: greater levels of both autistic traits and anxiety symptoms and, in community samples, lower levels of conduct disorder symptoms. Across samples, SOR is not reliably associated with symptoms of any other analyzed psychiatric conditions. SOR is associated with both brain-wide and circuit-specific resting-state functional connectivity (FC) patterns that replicate across independent subsamples and highlight FC differences between cingulo-parietal network and bilateral caudate nucleus. Our results demonstrate that SOR may constitute a transdiagnostic latent trait with both specific clinical risk and protection, and with replicable neural correlates that implicate specific cortico-subcortical circuits. These findings advance our understanding of the neurobiology and clinical relevance of SOR.

However, they often overlook crucial aspects of adaptation, including the long-term temporal evolutionary dynamics, the predictability of evolutionary outcomes, the influence of past evolution on future evolutionary trajectories (contingency), and the extent and diversity of molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation. Experimental evolution has been a useful tool to answer these questions, but extracting fundamental principles and predictive features of evolutionary outcomes from these datasets remains challenging due to the large number of covariates and confounding effects, such as differences in experimental setups, species lifestyle, gene content, and evolution rate. Here, we sought to circumvent these challenges by comparing distant yeast species with similar evolutionary features but different evolutionary history and genome architecture, i.e. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We evolved 10 populations of the fission yeast for 10,000 generations in the same conditions as a pre-existing budding yeast dataset, i.e. high-sugar media and hypoxic conditions, allowing us to observe repeatable evolutionary outcomes within species but diverse molecular mechanisms and targets of adaptation across species. Most of the S. pombe evolved populations exhibited adaptations to hypoxic stress (HS) at the expense of increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (OS). This trade-off has not previously been observed in S. cerevisiae evolved populations or wild Kluyveromyces lactis, but is seen in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus and clinically relevant populations such as some cancer cells, indicating that parallelism is pervasive in the tree of life and that mechanisms of adaptation can be shared among closely related or distant species. Despite similar gene content and identical environments, recurrent adaptations across S. pombe populations involved different genes than in S. cerevisiae and were mostly detectable at the transcriptomic level. This suggests that trans-regulatory effects may play an important role in adaptation on short evolutionary timescales and that differences in evolutionary outcomes between these species may be attributed to contingency.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

The local maize cultivar is characterized by extended maturity, tall stature, and presence of thick aerial roots that secrete an abundance of polysaccharide-rich root exudate, or mucilage, that is implicated in the recruitment of diazotrophic microbes to facilitate biological nitrogen fixation. Here we estimate the broad sense heritability of traits related to nitrogen fixation in a panel of Zea entries spanning pre-domestication, post-domestication and post-improvement, and identify QTL via F2:F3 families for traits including aerial root node counts and various other yield related traits (i.e. germination rate, time to reproductive maturity, total biomass and nitrogen content of shoot and grain). Across two separate field studies, aerial root node count (AR) demonstrates heritability of 64% and 73%, and genetic mapping reveals three distinct QTL distributed on chromosomes 1 and 9.

Competing models of basal ganglia (BG) function propose that BG neurons either signal sequence boundaries or encode movements across ordinal positions. Prior studies have largely examined fixed sequences with end-of-sequence rewards, leaving open whether such findings generalize to more naturalistic conditions. We trained four rhesus macaques to perform a visuomotor sequence task requiring four or five out-and-back joystick movements to peripheral targets. Sequences were completed under two conditions: a random condition, in which target order varied across trials, and a fixed condition, in which order was predictable and consistent. Rewards were delivered after each movement, dissociating reward timing from sequence completion. We recorded single-unit activity in arm-related regions of the globus pallidus (GP; n = 458) and primary motor cortex (M1; n = 306). Regression analyses revealed that many neurons in both GP and M1 encoded ordinal position within a sequence. Order effects were more frequent in the fixed condition, but were also present during random sequences. We found no evidence for preferential encoding of sequence initiation or termination in overlearned sequences, in contrast to prior studies reporting start/stop signals in basal ganglia. Weak effects appeared under the random condition in one animal pair, but these did not generalize across animals or conditions. Instead, neurons exhibited heterogeneous order-related responses spanning the full sequence. These results demonstrate that GP neurons, like those in M1, encode ordinal position throughout a sequence rather than acting solely as sequence initiators or terminators. This challenges boundary-specific models of BG function and highlights a broader role for the BG in representing serial order during motor sequence production.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Leveraging intravital two-photon microscopy, resting-state magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound-based and transdermal recordings, we found TGF-mediated oscillations across spatial scales, from single-nephron to whole-organ levels, and that male kidneys exhibited higher frequencies than females. To understand the mechanisms involved, we developed a dynamical systems model of TGF that agrees with physiological observations. Analysis of the mathematical model indicated that higher reabsorption rate and fluid flow efficiency in male proximal tubules not only result in higher frequencies, but also render male nephrons more susceptible to lose TGF-mediated oscillations. Furosemide abolished TGF-mediated oscillations in male kidneys and upregulated tubular injury marker, suggesting that the propensity to lose TGF-mediated oscillations underlies the heightened risk for injury in males.

P.; Fahmy, K.", "abstract": "The cell membrane facilitates interactions with the environment and serves as an organizational platform for coordinating cellular processes, with lipids playing a central role in determining membrane property and function. Yet, how lipidome composition influences cellular fitness remains poorly defined. Recent approaches to chemically tune and minimize the lipidomes of genomically minimized bacterial organisms such as JCVI-Syn3A/B offer a streamlined system to explore why cells need such diverse lipid chemistries. In this study, we use isothermal microcalorimetry to assess how changes in lipid composition affect heat dissipated by JCVI-Syn3B cells, a parameter reflecting both growth and metabolic efficiency. By transposing the Monod equation into a calorimetric equation and extending it to the full life times of batch cultures, we introduce a new approach to quantify the metabolic efficiency of JCVI-Syn3B. Remarkably, our results demonstrate that tuning lipidome composition results in considerable variations of energy dissipation at the expense of biomass production. As a consequence, the volume of these minimal cells becomes inversely coupled to the lipidome-dependent entropic cost of cell division. The corresponding change in heat flow per cell mass gives rise to a complex but systematic dependence of growth rates on lipid composition. Interestingly, the maximal rate correlates with maximal lipid diversity, suggesting that the ability to tune local cell membrane charge and curvature through lipid structural diversity is crucial for divisome function. Our observations highlight the critical role of lipidome composition in cell metabolism and growth, and provide a new tool for interrogating the relationship between membrane composition and cell fitness.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

To derive meaning from written words, visual input is first processed in unimodal (i.e., sensory-specific) visual streams and then engages a distributed language network (LANG) that includes classic perisylvian language areas and supports transmodal (i.e., sensory-nonspecific) functions. A reading-relevant region in the inferotemporal cortex (ITC), sometimes called the visual word form area (VWFA), has been the subject of controversy because it displays properties of both systems: it responds to meaningless written pseudowords, implying a unimodal visual function, but also responds to meaningful speech, implying a transmodal function. We investigated whether precision functional mapping could help clarify this region's role in reading. We characterized a stream of visual regions along the ITC that responded preferentially to visual orthographic forms (i.e., written pseudowords, consonant strings, and real words). Network mapping revealed that only the most anterior region of this \"orthographic stream\" was connected to the LANG network and accordingly showed responses to meaningful speech. Furthermore, this anterior region was more selective, responding preferentially to text-based stimuli, whereas the more posterior regions of the stream were additionally activated by perceptually similar images (i.e., number strings, foreign script). Our results support that connections to the LANG network may drive specialization along the orthographic stream for writing. This basal language network region may represent an interface between visual and transmodal language systems, thus serving as a critical nexus for reading.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of newly synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of pre-existing sarcomeres.

Yet, whether MR exerts an anti-tumor effect in the presence of an immune-competent background remains inconclusive. Accumulating evidence has shown an essential role of methionine in immune cell differentiation and function. Thus, competition for methionine between tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment may drive tumor growth and tumor response to therapy. Here, we aim to define the impact of MR on tumor growth and associated immunity. We first assessed the effect of MR in a series of immunocompetent mouse models of melanoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and lung. MR led to a broad tumor inhibition effect across these models and such tumor inhibition was not sex- or genetic background-dependent but appears to be fully or partially immune-dependent. Through flow cytometry analysis, we found a consistent increase in intratumoral activated CD8+ T cells across different tumor models and depletion of CD8+ T cells partially or completely reversed MR-induced tumor inhibition in a model dependent manner. Interestingly in young healthy non-tumor-bearing mice, MR increased spleen CD3+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Metabolomics and RNAseq analysis of spleen-derived CD8+ T cells revealed significant increase in purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism and that are in line with the metabolic feature of activated T cells. Furthermore, MR improved the efficacy of anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade. Together, MR primes T cell metabolism for its anti-tumor effect and improves the efficacy of anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

We show that cells defective in fork reversal exhibit reduced nucleosome density at replication forks, accompanied by the loss of parental histones during their transfer onto nascent DNA. Mechanistically, we showed that PrimPol activation leads to single-stranded DNA gaps in fork reversal deficient cells; PARylation and DNA-protein crosslinking on single-stranded DNA subsequently evicts nucleosomes.

Using an in vitro reprogramming, differentiation and neural maturation protocol, we obtained highly purified populations of post-mitotic motor neurons for both normal and diseased cells. As expected, as fibroblasts are reprogrammed into iPSCs, and as iPSCs differentiate into motor neurons, chromatin accessibility, chromosome conformation, and nuclear organization change along with large-scale alterations in transcriptional profiles. We find that the transcriptome changes extensively during the first three weeks of post-mitotic neuronal maturation, with thousands of genes changing expression, but then is relatively stable for the next three weeks. In contrast, chromosome conformation and nuclear organization continue to change over the entire 6-week maturation period: chromosome territoriality increases, long-range interactions along chromosomes decrease, compartmentalization strength increases, and centromeres and telomeres increasingly cluster. In motor neurons derived from ALS patients such changes in chromosome conformation were much reduced. Chromatin accessibility changes also showed delayed maturation. The transcriptome in these cells matured relatively normally but with notable changes in expression of genes involved in lipid, sterol and mitochondrial function. We conclude that neural maturation is associated with large scale post-mitotic changes in gene expression, chromosome conformation and nuclear organization, and that these processes are defective in motor neurons derived from ALS patients carrying C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Negative symptoms have been conceptualized in a hierarchical structure of two second-order dimensions -motivation and pleasure (MAP) and expression (EXP)- and five first-order domains: anhedonia, avolition, and asociality (MAP), and blunted affect and alogia (EXP). A better understanding of the neural circuitry underlying negative symptom dimensions and domains is important given their reported association with poor functional outcome and lack of available treatments. Study Design: The meta-analysis included 1,591 individuals with schizophrenia across 16 samples with structural imaging and Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms data. The study generated correlations of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes with the negative symptom dimensions and domains. Study results: Negative symptoms showed mainly negative associations with cortical thickness and subcortical volumes. The effect sizes were small but there was a pattern of associations in predominantly frontal lobe cortical thickness and limbic subcortical volumes. The regional correlation patterns of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes with symptom domains support the conceptualized hierarchical structure of negative symptoms: correlations of MAP domains were stronger with the MAP than EXP dimension, and vice versa. Exploratory analyses with receptor densities further supported the hierarchy.

Using Caenorhabditis elegans EDMD models, we demonstrate that lamin mutations dramatically alter cytoplasmic organization, reducing macromolecular crowding and increasing diffusivity of 40 nm Genetically Encoded Multimeric (GEM) nanoparticles. These striking biophysical changes coincide with nuclear positioning defects and collapsed endoplasmic reticulum architecture, mirroring phenotypes associated with ribosome depletion.

EMT triggers robust endolysosomal system upregulation and metabolic adaptations that balance proliferative and invasive states. Surprisingly, invasive cells rely on scavenging via lysosomes and macropinocytosis to acquire amino acids, rather than plasma membrane transport, even in nutrient-rich conditions. Macropinocytosis increases intracellular amino acid storage, promoting survival during amino acid deprivation. This metabolic shift depends on c-MYC downregulation, an early EMT event. Reintroducing c-MYC suppresses the metabolic switch, endolysosomal induction, macropinocytosis, and the proliferation-to-migration transition.

Initially, numerical softening factors were implemented, allowing greater overlap between particles to expedite computations, with an optimal value of 0.03 selected. Adhesion forces between RBCs and the channel wall were incorporated, with a minimum effective distance of 0.4 um identified as computationally feasible. However, inter-RBC adhesion led to artificial clustering and was therefore omitted. Coarse-graining methods were applied up to a factor of 2 to further reduce simulation time, with a value of 1.8 chosen based on consistent cell-free layer (CFL) thickness and drag force characteristics. To correct for the increased drag in coarse-grained models, rolling resistance (Type C) with a coefficient of 0.8 was employed, bringing deviations within 10%. The validated model was then extended to simulate the detachment of adherent C2C12 myoblasts under physiological flow. Experimental validation showed increasing cell retention with seeding time, and simulations reproduced this trend with <5% deviation. The resulting Detachment Force Ratio (DFR) at 6 hours indicates near-equivalence between adhesion and hydrodynamic forces, establishing the model's robustness for cell-substrate interaction studies in microfluidics.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Sgo1, a meiosis-specific shugoshin in fission yeast, collaborates with the PP2A phosphatase enzyme to remove phosphate groups from Rec8 cohesin, thereby preventing its cleavage by separase during meiosis. Here we show that ectopic expression of Sgo1 causes chromosome segregation errors during mitosis, especially in cut1-206 separase mutant cells, but that the D-box mutant Sgo1 has no effect in cut1-206 cells. Our molecular genetic analyses suggest that the D-box of Sgo1 directly binds Slp1/CDC20 and inhibits APC/C-dependent separase activation, thereby preventing cleavage of Rad21 cohesin. In contrast, during meiosis, the Sgo1 D-box mutant makes the cut1-206 mutant more difficult to cleave Rec8 cohesin. This is because the D-box mutation increases the amount of Sgo1 protein during meiosis, thereby enhancing its canonical protective ability against Rec8 cohesin. Thus, our studies using a separase mutant have revealed that Sgo1 has multiple faces to protect coheisn.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Using a PI5P biosensor, we identify a significant mitochondrial PI5P pool, whose abundance increases upon metabolic stress induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose exposure, most likely in a PIKfyve-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PIKfyve-positive endolysosomes localize in close proximity to mitochondria in an actin-dependent manner, suggesting a spatial and functional coupling between these two organelles.

Here, we comprehensively measured human NK cells and T cell expression of NK cell-associated receptors to define their co-expression and patterns associated with donor sex, maturation, and activation. To assess the activating and inhibitory receptor repertoire of human T cells and NK cells, we developed a 25-colour flow cytometry panel that included channels based on receptor functions. Since NK cell function is known to be driven by interactions with HLA supergroups (KIR ligands), we stratified donors based on KIR-HLA allelic combinations. NK and CD8+ T cell phenotypes and responsiveness were assessed at rest, and in response to the missing self target cell line, K562.

However, the scarcity of genetic interaction data in most species hinders research progress. Understanding the conservation of genetic interactions across species can partially bridge the current data gap. Previous conservation studies focused on subsets of genes and relied on the incomplete genetic networks available at the time, limiting the generalization of their findings. This study systematically quantifies the conservation of the genetic interaction networks between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe using a comprehensive global genetic interaction map. Conservation is evaluated at three levels of increasing complexity: gene connectivity, individual genetic interactions, and genetic interaction profiles. Overall, the analyses show significant conservation across species at all levels, particularly among functionally related genes, 1:1 orthologs, and less diverged orthologs. However, the functional redundancy caused by gene duplication decreases cross-species conservation, resulting in lower connectivity, loss of individual interactions, and enrichment for trigenic interactions. This disruptive effect can be partially reversed upon divergence of the duplicated pair. Additionally, this work provides predictions for genetic interactions in S. pombe and trigenic interactions in S. cerevisiae. Together, the findings presented here offer a framework to explore the genetic interaction landscape in species lacking such experimental data, including cancer cell lines once large-scale genetic interaction data for human becomes available.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Integrins are extracellular matrix receptors expressed on skeletal muscle cells and hepatocytes and have been implicated in modulating obesity-associated insulin resistance. Integrins regulate cell function through intracellular proteins including the ILK-PINCH-Parvin (IPP) complex. ILK promotes skeletal muscle and liver insulin resistance in diet-induced obesity in mice but the role of Parvin is unexplored. Here we demonstrate that hepatocyte specific deletion of alpha-Parvin had only minimal influence on endogenous glucose production or whole-body insulin sensitivity. In contrast, deletion of alpha-Parvin in skeletal muscle caused a striking reduction in muscle glucose uptake during an insulin clamp in lean mice which was not exacerbated by diet-induced obesity. Insulin-mediated GLUT4 membrane recruitment was impaired in mutant muscles which displayed significant morphological abnormalities due to actin cytoskeleton dysfunction. Consistent with severe muscular dysfunction, mitochondrial oxidative capacity and aerobic exercise capacity were blunted in muscle alpha-Parvin-null mice. Thus, alpha-Parvin has a minor role in liver insulin action but is required for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle due to its role in actin cytoskeleton regulation.

Using a Bayesian framework, curated fossil data, and an expanded method to assess competition intensity at multiple spatial scales, we quantify speciation, extinction, and diversity patterns across 17 families. Our results show that competition significantly influences diversification on both continents. Mechanisms vary by scale, with contrasting associations between diversification rates and predictive timeseries. While competition can hinder speciation by saturating ecological niches, it may also foster diversity via character displacement and niche partitioning, especially under local spatial coexistence. At regional scales, abiotic factors, particularly cooling temperatures and habitat shifts, act as selective extinction drivers, disproportionately affecting specific regions of the morphospace and creating gaps. By integrating temporal and spatial perspectives, our study enhances understanding of how biotic interactions and environmental changes jointly shape biodiversity through deep time.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

In particular, inclusion of very long branch (VLB) taxa with highly elevated rates may lead to phylogenomic misinference. Methods: We explore how rapidly evolving plastomes behave in model-based phylogenetic inferences of the yam order Dioscoreales, which experienced convergent photosynthesis losses. The taxon sampling includes all photosynthetic genera, and mycoheterotrophic lineages with a broad range of substitution rates. Results: When only moderately rapidly evolving heterotrophs are included, relationships within Dioscoreales are congruent with recent mitochondrial analysis, and generally strongly supported. Photosynthetic Stenomeris (represented by only three genes) is moderately supported as sister to Dioscoreaceae. Notably, Burmanniaceae and Thismiaceae, two mycoheterotrophic families including highly reduced plastomes, are strongly supported as distantly related within Dioscoreales. Constrained analysis rejects combining Thismiaceae with Burmanniaceae, conflicting with current angiosperm classification. Including VLB mycoheterotrophs in phylogenetic inference can lead to localized to broad reduction in branch support, substantially so for Afrothismiaceae, a family placing in disparate locations in Dioscoreales (and beyond) in variant analyses, with no ability to differentiate among its alternative placements. Conclusions: Inclusion of highly rate-elevated taxa in analyses of Dioscoreales phylogeny can depress branch support. Inferred relationships in the order are otherwise congruent with studies based on mitochondrial data; the family-level classification needs updating. The extraordinarily rapidly evolving family Afrothismiaceae places inconsistently in diverse plastid analyses, pointing to probable analytical limits for plastid-based phylogenomic analyses of VLB heterotrophs.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

To maximise the translatability of preclinical toxicology studies, an understanding of the relative hepatic stress response capacities of humans and widely-used preclinical animal species is vital. In control liver tissue, the basal gene and protein expression of stress response pathway components was found to be greater in rodents than non-rodent preclinical species and humans. In addition, following in vitro exposure to pharmacological modulators of the NRF2 and ER stress responses, rodent hepatocytes generally displayed a greater capacity, relative to those of non-rodent preclinical species and humans, for adaptation to cellular stress. Consistent with the reported lower concordance of drug toxicity between humans and rats, the latter displayed a greater level of Torin1-induced autophagic flux than all other species, while the robust transcriptional responses to thapsigargin-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and Bardoxolone- or Ki696-mediated NRF2 activation were comparable between mouse and rat hepatocytes. In all, our results indicate that rodent preclinical species possess a greater basal and adaptive hepatic capacity for mitigation of chemical insult than non-rodent preclinical species and humans.

I curated 39,121 hemagglutinin (H3) protein sequences from GISAID with passage annotations and associated sample metadata to create models of sequence change. Gradient boosted decision trees were trained with encoded amino acids plus latitude, longitude, and date; SHAP values quantified site importance. The passage classifier achieved 81% overall accuracy (balanced accuracy = 0.77), distinguishing egg grown from unpassaged isolates with nearly 90% recall, and recovering known and novel adaptive substitutions. A separate regressor, trained solely on unpassaged sequences, predicted sample collection date with R2 = 0.98 and a mean absolute error of 74.5 days. Crucially, the sites identified as most important by the models showed a strong enrichment for experimentally validated antigenic sites, with the passage model ranking these functionally critical residues far more effectively than traditional evolutionary metrics. Across both tasks, correlations between SHAP values and standard evolutionary metrics were strong (0.63 [&le;] {rho} [&le;] 0.9), indicating a strong connection between importance and variability depending on model specification.

Instead, diversification has been driven by chromosomal rearrangements and the emergence of subgenome asymmetry. The dominant D subgenome maintains more genes, exhibits higher expression, and is enriched for adaptive functions, while the submissive S subgenome is inclined towards housekeeping roles. This asymmetry is further reinforced by the accumulation of transposable elements near genes exhibiting expression biased toward the S-subgenome. We also identify a derived epigenetic mechanism in the cave ecotype, i.e., differential methylation of these elements, absent in the surface ecotype. These findings show how structural, regulatory, and epigenetic processes have interacted following allopolyploidy to produce ecological and phenotypic diversity in Sinocyclocheilus.

Reliable circulating biomarkers for vascular remodeling are lacking, and extracellular vesicles (EVs), which transport molecular cargo that reflects their cellular origin, have emerged as potential biomarkers and modulators of vascular inflammation. However, their role in TAK remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between EV-derived microRNA (miRNA) signatures and clinically relevant vascular phenotypes, with a primary focus on aortic dilation. Methods: Circulating small EVs (sEVs) were isolated from the serum of patients with TAK and healthy controls, characterized by high-sensitivity flow cytometry, were profiled for miRNA content, and analyzed using bioinformatic pathway enrichment. In vitro assays were employed in assessing their impact on endothelial activation, while the diagnostic performance of miRNAs was compared to conventional biomarkers and clinical parameters. Results: sEVs from patients with TAK upregulated the endothelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, thereby enhancing monocyte adhesion in vitro, consistent with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched in PI3K?Akt signaling, with phosphatase and tensin homolog identified as a key predicted target. Among patients, miR-223-3p was selectively downregulated in those with aortic dilation, regardless of disease activity or treatment status. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that miR-223-3p identified aortic dilation with an area under the curve of 0.748, outperforming C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Flow cytometric analysis suggested that platelet-derived EVs represent a predominant source of circulating miR-223-3p, and their proportion tended to be reduced in patients with aortic dilation. Conclusions: Reduced platelet-derived EV-associated miR-223-3ps are associated with aortic dilation in TAK and demonstrate superior diagnostic accuracy over conventional inflammatory markers.

We found that nestlings with good body condition also showed increased activity levels. Active nestlings fledged earlier and remained more active after fledging than passive nestlings during early post-fledging. Increased post-fledging activity levels were related to an increased number of pre-dispersal forays and an early timing of dispersal.

Nonetheless, root exudation data and its spatio-temporal plasticity is scarce. This study provides insights into compound-specific root exudation in three temperate tree species in two seasons (late spring and late summer) and two soil compartments (forest floor and the top mineral soil), including the effect of soil chemistry. At four sites with differing mean annual temperature and soil phosphorus level, root exudates were sampled using an in-situ cuvette-based system and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found seasonally and spatially varying site- and species-specific exudation patterns. While the seasonal pattern was similar among species and sites, with higher exudation rates in late spring, soil compartment-specific exudation depended on species and site. Acer pseudoplatanus tended to exude more into the mineral soil at warmer sites, while Picea abies exuded more in the mineral soil at all sites. Exudation by Fagus sylvatica was independent from the soil compartment. Significant correlation between exchangeable soil cations and specific compounds exuded by F. sylvatica and P. abies were found. Exudation of specific compounds in F. sylvatica increased with the concentration of exchangeable Mg, Al and Fe, whereas exudation rates in P. abies decreased with most base cations' concentration, while sugar exudation increased with the exchangeable non-base cations Al and Fe. These results demonstrate that root exudation is dynamically adjusted to the species-specific nutritional needs governed by site, season and soil characteristics.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

U.; Nasiri, S.; Chiasson, S. A.; Couvrette, L. J.; Laliberte, A. M.; Bui, T. V.", "abstract": "Adaptation of muscle activity to meet a certain target or intention is traditionally attributed to supraspinal structures. However, evidence is mounting that this process can occur within the spinal cord through intrinsic plasticity and circuit reorganization. Here, we investigate the role of a class of excitatory spinal interneurons, called dorsal interneuron 3 (dI3), in the acquisition of novel motor behaviors independent of supraspinal input. Using a real-time closed-loop stimulation paradigm in spinalized mice, we promoted a persistent adaptation in the hindlimb position to be higher than its resting level by delivering saphenous nerve stimulation contingent on toe elevation. The stimulation intensities were calibrated to selectively recruit low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs). To test the contribution of dI3s in this motor adaptation, inhibitory DREADD (hM4Di) receptors were expressed in Isl1/Vglut2 cells, achieving reversible, cell-type-specific silencing of dI3s. Our results demonstrate that stimulation of cutaneous inputs to the spinal cord contingent on a certain positional goal can generate sustained changes in motor activity, in this case, in the form of elevation of toe position above a preset vertical threshold. Chemogenetic silencing of dI3s abolished this motor adaptation induced by activation of LTMRs. These findings indicate that dI3 activity is essential for a particular type of motor adaptation driven primarily by LTMR input.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYWe developed a real-time, closed-loop stimulation paradigm in spinalized mice using kinematic video tracking to trigger electrical stimulation of the saphenous nerve. We discovered that low-threshold stimulations targeting non-nociceptive cutaneous afferents can elicit sustained motor adaptations independently from supraspinal input. Furthermore, using two chemogenetic techniques to transiently inhibit a population of spinal neurons, called dI3s, we found that these neurons are crucial for integrating these low-threshold stimuli to elicit sustained changes in motor behaviour.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

From 2012 to 2023, 3443 juveniles were ringed and monitored. Estimated survival rates varied significantly with age, but there was no difference between rehabilitated and wild birds.

The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model remains a cornerstone of mathematical epidemiology, yet the robustness of its numerical treatment strongly influences predictive reliability in applications ranging from outbreak forecasting to intervention assessment. Here, we introduce a high-order Summation-By-Parts (SBP) framework with Simultaneous Approximation Terms (SAT) for the numerical solution of the SIR system. Unlike standard integrators, the SBP-SAT method enforces stability at the discrete level while retaining high accuracy, offering a principled approach for handling nonlinear epidemic dynamics. We validate the scheme against the analytical solution of the classical SIR model, demonstrating both accuracy and robustness. By situating SBP-SAT methods within the growing landscape of numerical approaches for SIR-type models--including Runge-Kutta, finite difference, and fractional-order solvers--this work establishes SBP-SAT as a powerful and generalizable alternative for computational epidemiology. Beyond the classical SIR model, these results pave the way for applying SBP-SAT schemes to more complex epidemic models where stability and accuracy are critical, thereby advancing the methodological foundations of computational biology.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

However, an in vivo study shows that cantilever loading-induced osteogenesis is prominent only at the anterio-lateral side of the mid-diaphyseal section of a mouse tibia, despite an equal magnitude of strain, fluid velocity, and pore pressure at the medial-posterior surface, located just opposite to it. This indicates that the magnitude of individual stimuli alone is not sufficient, as these stimuli appear to interact to induce new bone formation. The present work aims to investigate this interplay by analysing the above-mentioned in vivo study, and developing an improved mathematical model to predict new bone formation. A poroelastic model was developed using finite element analysis. The tensile side of the bone section was found to have predominantly negative pore-pressure, which stretches the cell processes radially. In contrast, the compressive side predominantly exhibits positive pore pressure, which compresses the osteocyte processes radially. According to the literature, fluid flow applies drag forces on the tethering fibres of osteocytes, resulting in radial stretching of the cell processes, similar to the effect of negative pressure. Accordingly, the net radial displacement due to the combined effect of fluid flow and pore pressure is expected to be greater at the anterio-lateral site compared with the medio-posterior site. We hypothesize that this mechanism leads to new bone formation at the anterio-lateral side only. To test this hypothesis, a Fourier series was used to approximate pore pressure as well as fluid velocity. In line with the literature, effective negative pressure due to fluid flow was assumed to be proportional to the fluid velocity. The strains induced by these stimuli were analytically computed assuming viscoelastic behaviour. The viscoelastic dissipation energy density due to the combined effect was then computed. The mineral apposition rate (MAR) was assumed to be proportional to the square root of the dissipation energy density above a reference value, consistent with the literature. The present work provides evidence that fluid velocity and pore pressure are not only critical stimuli for new bone formation but that their interaction governs the process. This insight advances existing knowledge and may help in designing interventions for treating bone loss.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

The enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) is a key contributor to endogenous H2S and polysulfide production, but its role in tumor-immune interactions remains poorly defined. Here, we show that 3-MST is the most abundantly expressed H2S-synthesizing enzyme in human renal cell carcinoma cells (RCC) and that high 3-MST expression correlates with reduced patient survival. Pharmacological inhibition of 3-MST lowered intracellular H2S levels in Renca renal carcinoma cells, suppressed proliferation, induced apoptosis, and increased surface expression of the immunogenic markers CD70, CD86, and PD-L1. In immune cells, partial inhibition of 3-MST promoted T cell activation, as evidenced by increased CD69 expression on both CD4+; helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. In contrast, complete inhibition of 3-MST, achieved by high concentrations of the inhibitor, modestly reduced CD8+ T cell proliferation. Functionally, 3-MST inhibition potentiated antigen-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated killing of tumor cells, an effect further amplified by PD-L1 blockade. These results establish 3-MST as a redox-sensitive metabolic driver of tumor growth and immune evasion in RCC and demonstrate that its inhibition can boost antitumor immune responses, offering a potential avenue for combination immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Its infectious cycle goes through an early phase of leaf infection and a late phase of colonization and infection of the stem. The disease is mainly controlled by plant genetic resistances targeting a limited set of early fungal effector genes overexpressed during leaf infection and located in dynamic repeat-rich genomic regions. Thus, these resistances can be rapidly overcome by the pathogen. To find new sources of resistance, we focused on late effector genes, expressed during stem infection and located in gene-rich regions. A previous study revealed a quantitative resistance in the stem partly relying on a gene-for-gene interaction with a late effector gene. In this study, we deciphered whether all late effector genes shared the same genomic and evolutionary characteristics, and if they could be more stable than early effector genes, rendering the resistances they trigger more durable. In addition, as previous studies highlighted new criteria for selecting late effectors and suggested B. napus semi-winter genotypes as an interesting genetic pool for uncovering resistance sources, we selected six new late effector gene candidates and screened an enlarged panel of semi-winter genotypes. We revealed that early and late effector genes diverged for most of their genomic characteristics supplying for the hypothesis of late effector genes being more conserved. Moreover, we revealed new resistance sources to late effector genes, almost all belonging to the semi-winter genetic pool, validating their importance to uncover new resistance sources.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

It also contains transposases, redundant genes, repetitive DNA sequences, integrases, and remnants of lysogenized mycobacteriophages. These factors can result in intragenomic recombination, resulting in the formation of fusion transcripts. The present study aimed to identify signatures of long-distance gene fusion transcripts in RNA-seq data of clinical Mtb isolates. Methodology: Three approaches based on separate principles (split read alignment, repurposing STAR chimera, and transcript de novo assembly). The intersections of fusion calls between the three approaches that showed maximum performance were used for detecting fusions with real RNA-seq datasets of Mtb. Results: The junction of the split reads approach and the repurposed STAR chimera showed a high performance (F1 > 0.9). Sequence characteristics, clustering, and gene burden of operonic and long-distance gene fusions were consistent between the two independent real datasets, showing robustness of the optimized strategy. Fusion transcripts showed lineage specificity and signatures of indirect involvement of transposases, and transposition accessory genes (Rv1199c, Rv2512c, Rv3115, Rv0395, Rv2808, and Rv3327) in intragenomic recombination, resulting in the formation of fusion transcripts. The fusions mainly were within transposases, PPE, PE_PGRS family proteins, and some isolated fusions were of genes involved in the MoCo pathway, vesicle transport, and lipid turnover. Conclusions: The observed fusions are likely driven by natural recombination, resulting in the formation of fusion proteins, coregulating proteins, or disruption. The study shows that the Mtb genome, especially of clinical isolates, may not be as stable as believed. Importance: The Mtb genome is believed to be stable, clonal, and immune to HGT, and thus, only SNPs and INDELs are thought to drive evolution. However, the drastic differences in phenotypes such as growth kinetics, virulence, and metabolic rate observed in clinical isolates compared to laboratory strains cannot be entirely attributable to SNPs and INDELs. The Mtb genome contains transposases and other accessory genes that can drive intragenomic recombination, bringing distant genes closer. As a result, there is a possibility of the occurrence of fusion transcripts. Growing evidence and our previous contributions also suggest changes in gene repertoires and gene copy numbers, which are also likely driven by intragenomic recombination events. This study presents optimization of a robust and easy-to-implement fusion calling algorithm using traditional bioinformatic calls. Using the same, we report fusion transcripts of non-operonic genes in the RNA-seq data of clinical Mtb isolates.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

A critical factor for achieving this goal is the optimization of electrical coupling between the skin and external electrodes, especially when detecting weak brain signals in the millivolt to microvolt range. In this study, we employed a Taguchi Design of Experiment (DoE) methodology to optimize the composition of an electrolyte solution used to enhance signal quality in a 14-electrode wearable EEG sensor system. We investigated four electrolyte components Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Potassium Chloride (KCl), Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHCO), and Tween-20 surfactant each varied across three concentration levels using an L9 orthogonal array. For each experimental condition, ten measurements were collected to ensure statistical reliability. Two statistical analytical approaches were applied: average signal strength analysis, which exhibited considerable variability and limited diagnostic value, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis, which used logarithmic scaling to provide more meaningful insights by minimizing noise effects. Results underscore that while the three salts made comparable contributions, the Tween-20 surfactant was the dominant factor affecting EEG signal strength. Additionally, all four factors exhibited non-linear behavior across concentration levels. This work presents a systematic optimization approach for improving electrolyte formulations and offers practical guidance for enhancing electrical coupling in EEG systems.

OTMalign leverages the theory of Optimal Transport (OT) to establish a soft correspondence between protein structures, guided by a TM-score-inspired reward matrix. This avoids the pitfalls of combinatorial searches and provides a global perspective at each iteration. The optimal rigid body transformation is then determined analytically using a weighted Kabsch algorithm, where the weights are derived from the OT correspondence matrix (the P matrix). We demonstrate that this P matrix effectively captures the structural similarity, and its use in a weighted covariance matrix allows for a direct SVD-based solution for the rotation and translation.

Our previous work demonstrated that combining Fulv with acetyl-CoA synthase inhibitor (ACSI) targeting Acyl-CoA Synthetase Short Chain Family Member 2 (ACSS2), synergistically reduced ER+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) cell viability in vitro. Using multiple analytical approaches, isotope tracing, CUT&RUN sequencing, immunofluorescence, western blot, and RNA sequencing, we characterized the effects of acetyl-CoA synthesis inhibition on Fulv-induced alterations. Fulv treatment of MBC cells increased ACSS2 expression and acetate utilization. Isotope tracing revealed that Fulv decreased acetate flux to the TCA cycle while promoting fatty acid synthesis. Importantly, ACSS2 was predominantly nuclear and CUT&RUN sequencing showed that Fulv treatment increased ACSS2 chromatin occupancy and ER/ACSS2/H3K27ac overlapping sites near genes associated with tumor progression, which was eliminated by combination of ACSI and Fulv. RNA sequencing revealed reduction of Fulv-induced expression of genes involved in cancer cell metabolism and key signaling pathways in cancer with the Fulv+ACSI combination. In a therapy-resistant xenograft model, combining Fulv and ACSI reduced Fulv-dependent increase in metastatic burden. Our findings indicate ACSS2 contributes to endocrine therapy resistance through nuclear acetyl-CoA provision for epigenetic alterations. Targeting these cancer cell adaptations represents a novel therapeutic approach potentially reducing metastasis-related mortality and improving breast cancer treatment outcomes.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Classical models proposed that these activity patterns are generated by mutual inhibition between the front signal Rac1 and the back signal RhoA, leading to opposing gradients that define the direction of cell migration. However, direct measurements of signal crosstalk showed that Rac1 can activate RhoA, which is incompatible with mutual inhibition. Furthermore, opposing Rac1 and RhoA gradients generated by mutual inhibition would need to overlap at least partially in the cell center. In contrast, both Rac and Rho activities were largely absent in the cell center, and both found to be highly localized near the cell edge in the cell periphery. Here, we hypothesized that these spatio-temporal Rho GTPase activity patterns are generated by the mutual inhibition between RhoA and the unconventional Rho family member Rnd3. Using rapid, optogenetic and chemical perturbations, we confirmed this mutual inhibitory crosstalk. However, we found that this crosstalk does not lead to the expected mutually exclusive spatio-temporal patterns of Rnd3 activity and cell retraction in spontaneously migrating, unperturbed cells. Instead, Rnd3 activity was even slightly elevated during cell retraction and was surprisingly depleted during cell protrusion. We discovered that this depletion is caused by the inhibition of Rnd3 by Rac1 activity, and that this newly identified inhibition is much more pronounced compared to the inhibition of Rnd3 by Rho. By combining rapid optogenetic perturbations with pharmacological manipulations, we found that Rac1 inhibition by Rnd3 is mediated by p21-activated kinases (PAKs). Investigations into the function of Rnd3 showed that it is required for the tight spatio-temporal regulation of the cell contraction/retraction signal Rho, and that it prevents ectopic, highly dynamic, spontaneous Rho activity pulses within the whole cell attachment area. Interestingly, protrusion-retraction dynamics were also severely inhibited in the absence of Rnd3, and its overexpression stimulated this process. Taken together, we show that Rac and not Rho acts as the major Rnd3 inhibitor in cells. Furthermore, our findings support a mechanism, in which Rnd3 acts as a global inhibitor of Rho that spatially restricts Rho activity to regions near the edge of migrating cells.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

The pathological hallmark is the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are intraneuronal lesions enriched in aggregated alpha-synuclein (S) that is typically hyper-phosphorylated at serine 129. Therefore, lowering phosphoserine 129 (pS129) may be a viable therapeutic strategy to treat PD. However, pS129 has also been proposed to regulate synaptic transmission and S degradation. In both cases, inhibiting pS129 could be detrimental. Here, we developed a sensitive assay in a human neuroblastoma model and utilized it to assess the relative expression levels and cytotoxicity of pS129 by comparing wild-type (WT) vs. S129A (pS129-deficient). We show that the S129A mutant does not affect the acute expression levels or toxicity of S in this transient transfection paradigm. This provides new insight into the intricate interplay between S, phosphorylation, toxicity, and degradation.

Although the role of dystrophin as a structural protein is well known, the cellular processes underlying myofiber degeneration are still not fully understood. Despite advances from studies in murine models, these models do not fully replicate the human pathology. Methods: We investigated sarcolemmal integrity, membrane repair capacity, and annexin protein expression in DMD patient muscle biopsies and human skeletal muscle cell lines using immunohistochemistry, a shear stress-based injury assay, western blotting, and live-cell imaging of GFP-tagged annexins. Results: We identified defective membrane repair in DMD skeletal muscle cells, independent of increased membrane fragility. Massive intracellular IgG uptake and impaired resealing after mechanical stress, respectively observed ex vivo and in vitro, confirmed this defect. We also observed altered expression patterns of annexins, a family of key proteins involved in membrane repair. Control skeletal muscle cells upregulate ANXA5 and ANXA6 upon mechanical stress, likely as part of an adaptive mechanism to counteract membrane damage. Conversely, DMD cells failed to induce this upregulation. Strikingly, ANXA2 was not only significantly overexpressed in DMD cells but also aberrantly localized to the extracellular space due to the defect in membrane repair. This extracellular ANXA2 is associated with adipocyte accumulation in muscle tissue, suggesting a mechanism similar to that seen in dysferlinopathies. Conclusions: Our findings propose that ANXA2 contributes to muscle degeneration in DMD and highlight it as a potential therapeutic target to prevent adipogenesis and muscle loss.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Much work has focused on how the nucleotide state of {beta}-tubulin regulates the structure and dynamics of microtubules. In contrast, less is known about the structure and function of the C-terminal tails (CTTs) of - and {beta}-tubulin which are thought to freely protrude from the surface of the microtubule. To study the CTTs, we developed three different biosensors that bind the tyrosinated -tubulin CTT (Y-CTT) on the microtubule lattice. Surprisingly, live imaging of the probes indicates that the Y-CTT is not accessible under normal cellular conditions. Lattice binding of the Y-CTT probes can be increased by three different ways of changing the tubulin conformational state: the drug Taxol, expression of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that recognize or promote an expanded tubulin conformation, or expression of tubulin that cannot hydrolyze GTP. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Y-CTT undergoes numerous transient interactions with the bodies of -tubulin and {beta}-tubulin in the lattice, and that the frequency of these interactions is regulated by the tubulin nucleotide state. These findings suggest that accessibility of the Y-CTT is governed by local nucleotide- and MAP-dependent conformational changes to tubulin subunits within the microtubule lattice.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Recent estimates suggest that the human genome contains more than 35,000 lncRNA genes, with roughly 20% predicted to encode micropeptides (MPs) with unknown functions. In this study, we focused on the subset of lncRNAs with strong statistical evidence for MP-encoding potential, accounting for approximately 8% of the unfiltered MPs collection. Our analysis centered on 1,782 high-confidence lncRNA-MPs derived from 478 genes expressed across 17 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We show that lncRNA-MPs display distinct amino acid compositions and unique 4-mer patterns compared to the human coding proteome. A few genes (9) with exceptionally long transcripts are characterized by [&ge;]20 MPs each. Functional interference confirmed that most of the lncRNA-MPs are unstructured. Only a third of the genes display some phylogenetic conservation, and only 4 genes display canonical N-terminal signal peptides characteristic of secreted proteins. We focused on cancer progression-associated lncRNAs that show differential expression (z-score >|3|) across consecutive tumor stages and metastatic states (transitional lncRNAs, Tr-lncRNAs). A collection of 72 genes encoding 314 MPs (Tr-lncRNA-MPs) was detected, with 76% of the MPs being [&ge;]30 amino acids long. Prediction by AlphaFold 2.0 and homology modeling tools revealed dozens of MPs with well-defined secondary structures and recognizable 3D motifs. Among the longer Tr-lncRNA-MPs (>60 amino acids), we confirmed the presence of ubiquitin-like, RNase H-related, and other conserved foldable motifs. Known cancer lncRNAs containing high-confidence MPs (XIST, UCA1, HOXA11-AS, LINC01234, and HAND-AS1) overlap with 50 pan-cancer lncRNAs associated with tumor stage or metastasis transitions. Together, these findings demonstrate that integrating sequence motifs (e.g., signal peptides, k-mers) with structural foldability offers a multifaceted view of lncRNA-MPs in cancer. We argue that the capacity to produce MPs may reinforce the oncogenic impact dominated by the lncRNA entity.

Recent studies have identified \"neogenes\" (NGs), genes normally silent in normal tissues but transcriptionally activated by OCTFs, as potential tumor-specific markers in fusion-driven cancers. In this study, we investigated the expression and regulation of DSRCT-specific NGs (DSRCT_NGs) using multimodal data across different cohorts of patients, PDX, and cell line data. We evaluated bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of patient specimens from MD Anderson Cancer Center, revealing the robust ability for DSRCT_NGs to distinguish FP-positive DSRCT from samples failing detection of the EWS::WT1 FP. To elucidate the regulatory role of the EWS::WT1 FP in driving NG expression, we performed knockdown experiments in four DSRCT cell lines. This consistently resulted in a reduction of DSRCT_NG expression. Isoform-specific expression of EWS::WT1 in LP9 and MeT-5A mesothelial cells revealed that the E-KTS isoform of EWS::WT1 predominantly drives DSRCT_NG expression. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq analyses demonstrated that EWS::WT1 directly binds to accessible chromatin regions near NG transcription start sites, enriched for WT1 motifs and active histone marks. Integration of Hi-ChIP data further revealed that EWS::WT1 facilitates long-range enhancer-promoter looping at DSRCT_NG loci, promoting the expression of nearby genes. Collectively, these findings establish DSRCT_NGs as direct transcriptional outputs of the EWS::WT1 FP and implicate their loci as regulatory regions of the DSRCT transcriptome.

This work investigates the use of NODEs to model protein crystallisation dynamics under data-scarce conditions. A NODE trained on a data-rich source system successfully captures solute consumption and particle size dynamics, but when applied to data-sparse target systems, scratch-trained NODEs exhibit limited generalisation and unphysical behaviours. To address this, several TL strategies are evaluated, including layer freezing, parameter deviation penalisation, and system-embedding within the neural architecture. Results show that layer freezing and deviation penalty consistently improve knowledge transfer, while system-embedding offers robustness in noisy or undersampled datasets. In addition, physics-informed NODEs, constrained to enforce monotonic concentration decay and crystal growth, demonstrate greater stability under high noise and sparse measurement regimes, ensuring physically consistent predictions. Overall, the combination of constrained NODEs with appropriate TL strategies provides a robust framework for accurate, transferable modelling of crystallisation systems in low-data regimes.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Results: We introduce DREAM-Stellar, a parallelized, updated version of the pairwise local aligner Stellar. The new aligner, DREAM-Stellar, is composed of four steps: preprocessing the queries and references, building a data structure for distributing the queries, computing in parallel the results and finally combining them. For distributing the queries we use the IBF data structure and a new prefilter for local alignments. We present our comparison of five local aligners on simulated and real genomic data and conclude that heuristic tools like BLAST miss a large percentage of significant local alignments or \"drown\" them in millions of less significant matches. The new version of Stellar is up to $900$ times faster than its predecessor and can find all alignments between a pair of genomes in minutes.

A.; Dimova, R.", "abstract": "Membrane fusion is essential for signaling, cargo delivery, and synthetic cell growth, yet its mechanical consequences remain poorly defined. How fusion-driven membrane growth can be sustained without compromising compartment stability remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we established a minimal reconstituted system where content-loaded small liposomes fuse with single cell-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), combining micropipette delivery, electrodeformation, and live imaging. Fusion outcomes were quantified through lipid and content mixing assays, GUV electrodeformation to track area and tension, and phase contrast imaging to monitor leakage. GUVs incorporated lipids and cargo from hundreds of thousands of vesicles at unprecedented efficiency rates, enabling substantial growth. However, accumulation of leaflet asymmetries induced curvature and tension, driving budding, rupture and leakage. Hemifusion amplified these destabilizing effects. Lipid number asymmetries emerge as a dominant mechanical cost of fusion, highlighting how cells may regulate these processes and guiding the design of therapeutic delivery systems and synthetic cells capable of robust and stable growth.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

However, research evidence on the application of PGRs in Soft White Common Spring Wheat (SWCSW) varieties is limited particularly in Columbia Basin. Therefore our objectives were to evaluate the effects of PGRs on SWCSW varieties exposed to different nitrogen (N) application levels. Two widely grown SWCSW varieties Louise and Diva were planted for two growing seasons using split plot design with four replications. Crop growth (stem height and diameter), yield and yield attributes (grain numbers per head, head numbers per fit, grain weight), quality characteristics (test weight, protein content) and lodging score were recorded following the application of PGRs at tillering (GS21-26), stem elongation (GS30-32), and flag leaf emergence (GS37-39) stages combined with high N fertilization. No lodging was observed during first season whereas it was witnessed during second season , and we observed a variable but positive response particularly under application of CC-C, TE, CC-BC and CC-AB. An increase in stem diameter and reduction in stem height were observed under PGR application which indirectly contributed to stem strength and reduced lodging. Although impact of PGRs application on grain numbers, head numbers grain yield and grain weight were non-significant and variable, we observed an improved performance of these attributes such as higher grain yield was observed under application of CC-B and CC-BC. The grain yield of Louise and Diva was similar at low and high N input. These results indicate that application of 168 kg N / ha is sufficient for an acceptable grain productivity and to gain agronomic returns. As we observed a significant seasonal impact and variations in the performance of SWCSW varieties, future research should consider long term evaluations to evaluate the impacts of PGRs on soft white common spring wheat varieties.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Hard red spring wheat (HRSW) is an important market class of wheat in North America with a rich history of breeding. We genotyped 1,013 HRSW lines representing a century of breeding material using a SNP array and targeted KASP genotyping to assess the changes in genetic diversity and Rht genes in HRSW from North America. Results show that early breeding efforts broadened an initially narrow gene pool derived from a few founders and subsequently maintained the genetic diversity. Analysis of Rht genes revealed that Rht-D1b was the predominant semi-dwarf allele from introduction of the Green Revolution genes (Rht-B1 and Rht-D1) in 1960s until the FHB epidemics of 1990s, when most breeding programs shifted to Rht-B1b. However, adoption of Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b remains low in some regions of the Great Plains. The dwarf alleles at GA-sensitive Rht24 and Rht25 have persisted in the region at low frequencies before the introduction of Green Revolution genes and have increased in frequency in recent decades. We also analyzed the effect of Rht genes on plant height (PH) in the HRSW growing region and found that Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b results in ~12% reduction in PH, which decreases to ~9% in dry environments. Notably, combining dwarfing alleles at Rht24 and Rht25 reduced height by ~6% in dry environments, suggesting an alternative approach for reducing PH. Our analysis also revealed significant genetic interactions between Rht-B1 and Rht25, as well as between Rht-D1 and Rht24, which could help fine-tune PH for different environments by employing appropriate Rht combinations. Furthermore, our results demonstrate positive selection for photoperiod sensitivity in recent decades, particularly in high-latitude regions. This study provides a valuable genomic resource, and the findings enhance our understanding of past breeding efforts while offering insights to guide future plant breeding strategies.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

We used a nascent allopolyploid lineage derived from goldfish (Carassius auratus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and established two populations in small and large water bodies for two generations. Genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic analyses revealed that the larger population had higher genetic diversity in subgenome R, while the smaller population had higher diversity in subgenome C. Potential selection regions were associated with growth regulatory genes, suggesting a role for gene regulation in body size adaptation. Dynamic gene expression patterns in various tissues indicated potential mechanisms underlying muscle development and adaptation to smaller water bodies. Furthermore, selection regions were linked to changes in chromatin accessibility, with subgenome R being more susceptible to these changes during genetic divergence.

Here, we present the first application of long-read single-cell RNA sequencing on nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls to resolve transcript-level changes across cell types. Our analysis identified major epithelial cell types and pronounced immune infiltration, with cell-type annotations concordant with those from short-read data. By enabling isoform-level resolution, our nanopore sequencing approach revealed cell-type specific alternative splicing, undetectable with short-read sequencing. For example, although gene-level expression of the key immune and apoptosis regulators, IFNAR2 and FAIM, did not differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls we identified marked shifts in isoform usage. Between moderate and critical cases, we observed cell-type specific differential transcript usage in the T cell signaling kinase FYN and the immune-regulatory transcription factor IRF2. As some of these splicing alterations yield functionally distinct isoforms, we hypothesize that alternative splicing modulates immune signaling and apoptosis, fine-tuning the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study demonstrates the unique power of long-read single-cell transcriptomics to uncover isoform-resolved regulatory changes, offering novel insights into the role of alternative splicing in shaping immune responses to viral infections.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Clinical-grade recombinant sACE2 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro but shows limited clinical success. This study reports an optimized sACE2 mutant fused to human IgG1 Fc (B5-D3), which redirects virus-decoy complexes to lysosomal degradation in macrophages. Intranasal prophylactic delivery of B5-D3 confers complete protection in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Abrogation of Fc effector functions compromises antiviral protection, indicating that Fc-mediated uptake of virus-decoy complexes is critical. Transcriptomic analysis suggests that B5-D3 induces early immune activation in lungs of infected mice. Bio-distribution and flow cytometry reveal selective targeting of airway phagocytes.

Additionally, this means that the uptake of both vaccines (including SARS-CoV-2 boosters) will be encouraged within the same timeframe. Currently, patients receive separate vaccines in different arms on the same or different days. Induction of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) is used as the measure of efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations while, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is the gold standard for seasonal influenza vaccine assessment. However, with the advent of novel universal influenza vaccine and dual SARS-CoV-2/Influenza vaccine approaches it is possible that functional NAb assays will become an essential component of a vaccine assessment toolbox. This assay is capable of distinguishing NAb responses during both dual vaccination development, and as part of co-infection and imprinting studies. Taking advantage of existing pseudotyped viruses developed by us, we present herein a dual neutralisation assay, which utilises 2 different luciferase (Renilla and Firefly) reporter lentiviral vectors. We configured assays with various combinations of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza subtype/variant combinations and compared sensitivity of this dual approach to neutralisation levels seen in single virus pseudotype Micro-neutralisation (pMN) in a double-blinded test of monoclonal antibody cocktails, and subsequently with a pre-screened serum panel. Mono and dual neutralisation pMN identified correctly positive and negative samples and IC50 values were all within 2-fold of each other, suggesting that specificity and sensitivity are retained post-multiplex. As we have taken a pseudovirus based approach there is the potential to tailor to specific vaccination candidates or currently circulating strains of each virus. The use of this versatile assay could form part of the toolbox of analysis of dual vaccination candidates and investigating responses during co-infection including studies assessing the impact of immune imprinting in the future.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

This model supports medium-throughput screening workflows for assessing antibiotic-mediated control of intracellular mycobacteria. Using this platform, we screened FDA-approved antipsychotics and identified the phenothiazines- trifluoperazine (TFP) and fluphenazine (FFP), as potent adjuncts to frontline anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). Combinations of either phenothiazine with frontline TB drugs enhanced intracellular bacterial clearance more effectively than the previously reported antidepressant sertraline, initiating significant control within 12 hours of treatment in macrophages. In murine models of TB infection, TFP and FFP further potentiated bacterial clearance and tissue recovery when used in combination with standard anti-TB therapy (ATT).

The supplement regimen reshaped the gut microbiota, counteracting the expansion of key mucin-degrading bacteria, including Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides goldsteinii. Metatranscriptomic analysis revealed this compositional change corresponded to a community-wide functional pivot away from expressing mucinolytic enzymes, such as sialidases, and towards utilizing alternative substrates.

To study the lasting impacts of decreased winter rain, we implemented two precipitation regimes (100% vs. 50% mean annual precipitation) in California Mediterranean-climate grassland field plots. After the dry season, soils were rewetted in the laboratory with H218O, and sampled at 0 h, 3 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 168 h post rewet. We quantified CO2 efflux; measured microbial growth and mortality via quantitative stable isotope (18O) probing and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; and characterized the soil organic carbon chemical composition, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes. We found that reduced winter precipitation imposed a strong legacy effect on microbial turnover; despite maintaining similar respiration rates, microbial growth declined by ~1 order of magnitude, yielding decreased community growth efficiency (CGE = gross community growth/net respiration), and microbial mortality declined by ~ 2 orders of magnitude. Soil organic carbon also shifted from lipid-like, amino-sugar-like, and protein-like compounds (indicative of microbial necromass) to more oxidized lignin-like and tannin-like compounds (indicative of decomposing plant-derived compounds). Meta-omics revealed distinct metabolic strategies linked to CGE. At high-CGE, microbes appeared to consume more energetically favorable N-rich necromass (released via high microbial turnover). This supported increased amino acid and peptidoglycan biosynthesis and enhanced aromatic compound degradation, generating acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle that sustains higher energy yield and growth efficiency. At low-CGE, communities had elevated carbohydrate metabolism and lipid turnover, consistent with increased investment in plant detritus degradation and membrane repair and maintenance rather than growth. Together, our findings demonstrate that reduced winter rainfall decreases microbial turnover.

There is increasing awareness of the ingestion of microplastics in a wide range of wild animals and humans, but their health and fitness impacts remain poorly understood. Mounting evidence suggests that microplastics could accumulate in the gut, affecting the microbiome and hindering its function. This may constitute a direct pathway through which exposure to microplastics could affect health and disease. However, prior studies on the effects of microplastic exposure on the microbiome show contrasting findings raising the question whether microplastics truly affect the microbiome. Here, we performed the first meta-analysis on the effects of dietary microplastic exposure on the gut microbiome of mice. Results: Overall, we found support for a significant impact of microplastic exposure on the relative abundance of gut bacteria. More in-depth analysis revealed microplastic exposure significantly increased the relative abundance of Bacillota and Pseudomonadota. In the gut microbiome, Bacillota is associated with carbohydrate metabolism and Pseudomonadota is associated with facultative anaerobes, thus these changes may have functional consequences.

Vaccine serotypes can persist despite pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction. To examine serotype persistence, we leveraged 6,545 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from children hospitalised with pneumonia before and after PCV13 introduction in Mongolia and undertook molecular, epidemiological and experimental analyses. Methods: Serotype, genetic lineage and antimicrobial resistance genes were inferred from DNA microarray. Patients carrying lineages that were predominant pre- and post-PCV introduction were examined for differences in disease severity. We also compared the pre- and post-PCV lineages by bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. Capsule gene expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), capsule thickness by transmission electron microscopy, and virulence using an infant mouse model. Findings: Changes in lineage composition were observed within serotypes 6A, 6B, 14, 19F and 23F over the six-year surveillance period. Children carrying pre-PCV lineages were more likely to have severe pneumonia than those carrying post-PCV lineages (serotypes 6B, 14 and 19F). Pre-PCV lineages were more likely to be multi-drug resistant than post-PCV lineages (serotypes 6A, 6B and 23F). For serotype 6B the post-PCV lineage had higher cell surface hydrophobicity, lower IgG, lower expression of capsule genes and evidence of thinner capsule than the pre-PCV lineage. Notably, the post-PCV 6B lineage was also less virulent in mice than the pre-PCV 6B lineage. Interpretation: Despite persistence of vaccine serotypes in highly vaccinated populations, vaccination may select for lineages with differences in capsule and antibody binding and that are less virulent.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and RNAscope integrated with spatial transcriptomics provided a high-resolution map of infection-induced gene expression, revealing localized immune responses and epithelial remodeling in defined colonic regions. Region-specific analysis further demonstrated that tissue-associated C. jejuni differentially modulates host gene expression compared to tissue-associated Enterobacteriaceae. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of defined microbial consortia and spatially resolved transcriptomics to dissect the complex interplay between host, microbiota, and pathogens during enteric infection.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Here we examine the molecular interactions between fungal cells and the brain endothelium by utilizing a human 3D organoid model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We show that Cn exploits the process of macropinocytosis as the mechanism of endocytosis into brain endothelial cells by recruiting CD44 and EphA2 as a molecular complex.

Yet, the findings from different data types or cohorts are often difficult to reconcile. Collecting multiple omics from the same individuals allows a comprehensive view of disease-related molecular mechanisms, while addressing conflicting findings derived from single omics. Such same-sample multi-omics can reveal, for instance, when changes observed in the transcriptome share distinct but coordinated signals in epigenetics and proteomics, relationships otherwise unclear. Here, we apply a data-driven multi-omic framework to integrate epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and cell-type-specific population data from up to 1,358 aged human brain samples from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We demonstrate the existence of sprawling cross-omics cross-system biological factors that also relate to AD phenotypes. The strongest AD-associated factor (factor 8) involved elevated immune activity at the epigenetic level, decreased expression of heat shock genes in the transcriptome, and disrupted energy metabolism and cytoskeletal dynamics in the proteome. We also showed immune-related factors (factors 2 and 3) with discordant enrichments, reflecting reactive-like glial subpopulations and protective contributions from surveillance microglia. Both were negatively associated with AD pathology, suggesting potential immune resilience mechanisms. Finally, unsupervised clustering of participants revealed eleven molecular subtypes of the aging brain, including three clusters strongly associated with AD but displaying distinct molecular signatures and phenotypic characteristics. Our findings provide a comprehensive map of molecular mechanisms underlying AD heterogeneity, highlighting the complex role of neuroinflammatory processes, and yielding potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine approaches to AD treatment.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

However, many prokaryotic Thi4 genes cluster on the chromosomal regions with genes encoding ThiS, ThiF, and other proteins that produce, relay, or use persulfide or thiocarboxylate sulfur. Such clusters include DUF6775 proteins, with domains of unknown function that feature a metal-binding motif. This comparative genomic evidence suggests that certain suicide Thi4s might use a persulfide or thiocarboxylate as sulfur donor instead of the active-site cysteine - i.e., that they can operate in a non-suicide mode - and that a metal cofactor reservoir supports Thi4 function. We explored both possibilities using Escherichia coli as a heterologous platform. A representative bacterial Thi4 (clustered with thiS and thiF) complemented an E. coli {triangleup}thiG (thiazole auxotroph) single mutant better than a {triangleup}thiG {triangleup}thiF {triangleup}thiS triple mutant, indicating that this Thi4 interacts with the E. coli sulfide transfer chain. A representative archaeal DUF6775 protein was expressed in E. coli; however, the bound metal was not detected in protein prepared from inclusion bodies.

In kinetoplastid parasites, acidocalcisomes and their polyphosphate content are essential for osmoregulation and environmental adaptation during host switching. In this organelle, polyphosphate is synthesised and transported to the lumen by the vacuolar transporter chaperone (VTC) complex. Interestingly, unlike yeast VTC, which has five components, only two have been observed in kinetoplastids: Vtc1, which contains only a transmembrane domain and Vtc4, which, in addition to a transmembrane domain, also consists of SPX and catalytic domains. In this study, we used proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) in Leishmania tarentolae to identify proteins located close to the VTC complex. The complex was found near several known acidocalcisomal proteins, including membrane-bound pyrophosphatase (mPPase), vacuolar-type V-H+-ATPase (V-H+-ATPase), Ca2+-transporting P-type ATPase (Ca2+-ATPase), zinc transporter (ZnT), and palmitoyl acyltransferase 2 (PAT2). Importantly, this approach revealed three novel VTC binding partners (VBPs) that colocalise and interact with the complex in acidocalcisomes, as confirmed by confocal microscopy, pulldown assays, and AlphaFold 3 structural predictions. Together, our results expand the acidocalcisome interactome and suggest that the newly identified VBPs may contribute to the structural organisation and regulatory function of the VTC complex in phosphate homeostasis of kinetoplastid parasites.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Fluidic exchange based sequential multiplexed imaging overcomes this limitation but requires time-consuming incubation and washing steps. We introduce a novel multiplexed fluorescent imaging method that uses rapid, orthogonal DNA strand displacement reactions to enable unlimited multiplexed fluorescent imaging without fluidic exchange. The signal switching between targets is achieved by strand displacement with added non-fluorescent DNA displacer strands, no fluidic washing step is required for sequential multiplexed imaging. We experimentally screened a set of rapid and orthogonal DNA displacement sequences for probe design and applied it for RNA imaging, which takes less than 30 seconds per round to complete in fixed cells. Because of the vast sequence design space of DNA probes, theoretically unlimited multiplexity can be achieved. Using 25 developed rapid orthogonal probes, we achieved 25-plex RNA imaging in a single fluorophore channel in fixed cells within 20 minutes. To further demonstrate robustness and practical usage of DIRSE-based imaging, we showed 24-plex RNA imaging with the method in retinal tissues and resolved different cell types. This DIRSE mechanism significantly simplifies the high-plex fluorescent imaging process with pre-programmed DNA probes and has broad biotechnical applications for future medicine and diagnostics.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

Yet, the majority of sequences in metagenomic datasets lack close relatives in existing references, representing a vast viral \"dark matter\" whose biology and evolution remain largely unknown. The central task is threefold: 1) to determine whether a genome is viral or non-viral, 2) to correctly assign viral genomes to known lineages when possible, and, critically, 3) to recognize when no existing lineage applies and thereby identify candidates for entirely novel viral groups. Existing approaches, which depend on sequence homology or narrow markers, struggle to capture this uncharted viral space. Here we present DeepVirus, a hierarchical transformer-based framework that models viral genomes as structured sequences of protein-coding genes. By combining protein-level embeddings from a foundation model with genome-aware representations, DeepVirus not only achieves accurate classification across deep taxonomic hierarchies, but also extends beyond conventional classification to detect and organize candidate novel viral lineages through open-set recognition. Applied to large-scale metagenomic resources, DeepVirus uncovered extensive viral diversity, including previously uncharacterized RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), thereby expanding the known evolutionary space of RNA viruses.

Using metagenomic sequencing and colony forming unit (CFU) counts in both conventional and gnotobiotic conditions, we uncover substantial microbiota differentiation among these populations. The most striking pattern is the consistent loss of Wolbachia in populations selected for rapid aging, in contrast to its near complete dominance in long-lived populations. This suggests a positive association between relative abundance of Wolbachia and lifespan, alongside a negative correlation between Wolbachia and Acetic Acid Bacteria (AAB) titres.

Adapting to these extremes, most bacteria possess high-affinity hydrogenases and carbon monoxide dehydrogenases, enabling them to use atmospheric trace gases such as hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) to generate energy and fix carbon. Despite the foundational importance of this process in polar desert ecosystems, little is known about the thermal sensitivity of trace gas oxidation or how this process will respond to climate warming. Here, we show through in situ and ex situ incubations that H2 consumption is an exceptionally thermally resilient process that can occur from -20 to +75{degrees}C, at rates comparable to temperate ecosystems (peaking at 8.56 nmol H2 h-1 g dry soil-1 at 25{degrees}C). Temperature ranges of CO (-20 to 42{degrees}C) and CH4 (-20 to 30{degrees}C) oxidation are also wider than expected, though the pattern of thermal sensitivity conforms with general theory. Metagenomic analyses support these data, revealing that atmospheric H2 and CO oxidisers are widespread, diverse, and abundant, and suggesting most Antarctic bacteria function below their temperature optima for these processes. Modelling of seasonal temperatures across ice-free Antarctica under current and future emissions scenarios indicates that H2 and CO oxidation can occur year-round, increasing by up to 35% or 44%, respectively, by 2100.

They are generated in a multi-step process initiated by the Microprocessor, a protein complex composed of DROSHA and DGCR8. Recent studies have described the phenomenon of \"cluster assistance\", in which a prototypic primary miRNA hairpin can license the Microprocessor-mediated processing of a clustered suboptimal hairpin in cis. Genetic screening and mechanistic analyses led to the identification of two critical factors for this process, SAFB2 (scaffold attachment factor B2) and ERH (enhancer of rudimentary homolog), which have been shown to associate with the N-termini of DROSHA and DGCR8, respectively, but also form a complex with each other. However, it remains unclear how SAFB2 and ERH can alter the Microprocessor substrate specificity, and whether the described protein-protein interactions are required for cluster assistance. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the SAFB2-ERH complex, revealing the interaction interface and show that mutation of critical residues weakens complex formation but does not affect cluster assistance. Accordingly, loss of SAFB1 and 2 or of ERH results in overlapping, but not identical defects in primary miRNA biogenesis, suggesting that both factors confer also unique roles in this process. Moreover, our data indicate that SAFB1/2 and ERH are required for efficient Microprocessor feedback regulation, uncovering a clear physiological function of cluster assistance impacting global miRNA abundance. Most importantly, we demonstrate that ERH-mediated cluster assistance does not require its described association with DGCR8, and show that its disruption affects only a small subset of cluster assistance-unrelated pri-miRNAs. Thus, this study reveals dual roles of ERH in primary miRNA biogenesis, one driven by its direct binding to DGCR8, and the other in cluster assistance that does not require DGCR8 binding.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}

SCP-MS analyses was performed using an Orbitrap Ascend Mass Spectrometer with a FAIMS Pro Duo interface coupled with Wide ISolation window High-resolution MS1 Data Independent Acquisition (WISH-DIA). Spectronaut was used for protein identification and quantification, and cell-type annotation and clustering were performed in Python by scanpy implementation. Results Workflow benchmarking using Hela cells confirmed a successful SCP-MS setup. From 768 single mouse kidney cells, SCP-MS identified 2626 unique proteins. Computational approaches resolved various nephron segments, including distinct DCT populations. From enriched DCT cells, 1912 proteins were identified, enabling classification of three populations - DCT1, DCT2, and a proliferative subset (ProLIF) that represented a transient state between DCT1 and DCT2. ProLIF cells had elevated abundance of the sodium-chloride cotransporter NCC and represented approximately 33% of DCT cells, substantially exceeding previous transcriptomic estimates of ProLIF cell frequency (~0.1%). High proliferation (~39%) of DCT cells was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. Conclusions This SCP-MS analysis of mouse kidney uncovered significant cellular heterogeneity not captured effectively using transcriptomics. Despite imitations in proteome depth and throughput, SCP-MS provides a powerful approach for investigating kidney cellular dynamics at the protein level.", "date": "2025-09-23", "journal": ""}
