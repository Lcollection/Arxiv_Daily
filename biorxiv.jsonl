We previously generated a single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) dataset for every anatomical neuron class in the C. elegans hermaphrodite. Here we present a complementary set of bulk RNA-seq samples for 52 of the 118 canonical neuron classes in C. elegans. We show that the bulk RNA-seq dataset captures both lowly expressed and noncoding RNAs that are not detected in the scRNA-Seq profile, but also includes false positives due to contamination by other cell types. We present an analytical strategy that integrates the two datasets, preserving both the specificity of scRNA-Seq data and the sensitivity of bulk RNA-Seq. We show that this integrated dataset enhances the sensitivity and accuracy of transcript detection and differential gene analysis. In addition, we show that the bulk RNA-Seq data set detects differentially expressed non-coding RNAs across neuron types, including multiple families of non-polyadenylated transcripts. We propose that our approach provides a new strategy for interrogating gene expression by bridging the gap between bulk and single cell methodologies for transcriptomic studies.

G.; Pezzulo, G.", "abstract": "Sequential sampling models of choice, such as the drift-diffusion model (DDM), are frequently fit to empirical data to account for a variety of effects related to choice accuracy/consistency and response time (RT). Sometimes, these models include extensions that can also account for choice confidence. However, no model in this class is able to account for the phenomenon of choice-induced preference change. Studies have reported choice-induced preference change for many decades, and the principle findings are robust: decision-makers tend to rate options higher after they choose them and lower after they reject them. This spreading of alternatives (SoA) in terms of their rated values is fundamentally incompatible with traditional sequential sampling models, which consider the rated values of the options to be stationary throughout choice deliberation. Here, we propose a simple modification of the basic DDM that allows the drift rate to vary across deliberation time depending on which attributes are attended to at which points in time. Critically, the model assumes that initial ratings are based only on the more salient attributes of the individual options, and that more attributes will be considered when decision-makers must choose between options with different salient attributes. We show that this model can account for SoA (in addition to choice consistency and RT), as well as all previously reported relationships between SoA and choice difficulty, attribute disparity, and RT.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Whereas animal studies have offered cellular- and synaptic-level accounts of these effects, human neuroimaging studies show that exercise improves hippocampal-cortical connectivity at the macroscale level. However, the neurophysiological basis of exercise-induced effects on hippocampal-cortical circuits remains unknown. Experimental evidence supports that hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWR) play a critical role in learning and memory. Coupling between SWRs in the hippocampus and neocortex may reflect modulations in inter-regional connectivity required by mnemonic processes. Here, we examine the hypothesis that exercise modulates hippocampal-cortical ripple dynamics in the human brain. We performed intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation, during awake resting state, before and after an exercise session. Exercise increased ripple rate in the hippocampus. Exercise also enhanced the coupling and phase-synchrony between cortical ripples in the limbic and the default mode (DM) cortical networks and hippocampal SWRs. Further, higher heart rate during exercise, reflecting exercise intensity, was related to a subsequent increase in resting state ripples across specific cortical networks including the DMN. These results offer the first direct evidence that a single exercise session elicits changes in ripple events, a well-established neurophysiological marker of mnemonic processing. The characterization and anatomical distribution of the described modulation points to hippocampal ripples as a potential mechanism by which exercise elicits its reported short-term effects in cognition.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

We compared the relative performance of a deep learning approach, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN), and outline analyses via geometric morphometrics using elliptical Fourier transforms (EFT) at identifying pairs of plant taxa. We used their seeds and fruit stones that are the most abundant organs in archaeobotanical assemblages, and whose morphological identification, chiefly between wild and domesticated types, allows to document their domestication and biogeographical history. We used existing modern datasets of four plant taxa (barley, olive, date palm and grapevine) corresponding to photographs of two orthogonal views of their seeds that were analysed separately to offer a larger spectrum of shape diversity. Sample sizes ranged from 473 to 1,769 seeds per class, which constitute a relatively small dataset for training CNNs models yet typical within archaeobotanical research. On these eight datasets, we compared the performance of CNN and EFT coupled with linear discriminant analyses. Our objectives were twofold: i) to test whether CNN can beat geometric morphometrics in taxonomic identification and if so, ii) to test which minimal sample size is required. We ran simulations on the full datasets and also on subsets, starting from 50 images in each binary class. For the CNN network, we deliberately used a candid approach relying on pre-parameterised VGG19 network. For EFT, we used a state-of-the art morphometrical pipeline. The main difference rests in the data used by each model: our CNN used bare photographs where EFT used outline coordinates. This \"pre-distilled\" geometrical description of seed outlines is often the most time-consuming part of morphometric studies. Results show that our CNN beats EFT in most cases, even for very small datasets. We finally discuss the potential of CNNs for archaeobotany, and how bioarchaeological studies could embrace both approaches, used in a complementary way, to better assess and understand the past history of species.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

In total, we identified 471,196 peptides from 22,479 proteins by searching against Araport11, revealing 32,110 isoform-specific peptides. Using an integrated proteogenomic workflow coupled with SUPPA, we classified these peptides into 2,442 AS events, 879 of which involved intron retention (IR). Further analysis of unannotated events revealed 91 additional IRs that are translated, confirming that retained introns can give rise to peptides. AlphaFold modeling predicted the structural and functional impacts of these isoforms. Our dataset improved existing gene model annotations. By comparing wild-type plants with the AS mutant acinus pinin, we found that IR regulates transcript and protein abundance nonlinearly. Phenotypic assays confirmed the functional consequences, including reduced chlorophyll, impaired growth, and increased anthocyanin.

The main vector of JEV is Culex spp. (mainly C. tritaeniorhynchus). The intraspecies structure of JEV comprises five genotypes (GI-GV). In the previous studies, the substitution rate and the age of the JEV most recent common ancestor (MRCA) based on complete open reading frame (ORF) / whole genome sequences were reported, however, the estimates are significantly different between some of the studies. Most importantly, the temporal signal in nucleotide data as the key aspect of the molecular clock application was evaluated by neither formal nor informal tests. In February 2023, we found 325 non-recombinant nucleotide sequences of ORF with known collection dates. The purpose of our study is the evaluation of temporal signal in the JEV ORF nucleotide data set using the Bayesian approach with the subsequent re-estimation of substitution rate and the age of the JEV common clade (GI-GV) and two JEV genotypes (GI and GIII) characterized by the number of sequences enough for reliable estimates. Results showed the presence of temporal signal in all analyzed data set. The substitution rate of the JEV GI-GV was 2.41x10^-4 (95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval, 1.67x10^-4--3.14x10^-4) or approximately 2.5 nucleotide substitutions per ORF (10,296 nucleotides) per year that is one the lowest substitution rate among the species closely related to JEV and other well-studied members of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. The substitution rate of GI and GIII evaluated as 4.13x10^-4 (95% HPD interval, 3.45x10^-4--4.82x10^-4) and 6.17x10^-5 (95% HPD interval 3.84x10^-5--8.62x10^-5), accordingly, with the ages of clades of 153 (95% HPD, 87--237) and 216 (95% HPD, 139--317), respectively.

The main hypothesis invoked to explain the evolution of imprinted genes is the kinship theory, which posits a conflict between parental genomes over resource allocation in progeny. According to this theory, imprinted genes are expected to undergo a shift from balancing to directional selection, in coding or regulatory regions. However, most studies addressing selection in imprinted genes have focused on self-fertilizing species, where conflicts over resource allocation are predicted to be weak. Consequently, the impact of kinship theory on the evolution of imprinted genes remains largely untested. Furthermore, the predicted coevolution between certain imprinted genes under kinship theory has not been tested yet empirically. Combined phylogenetic and population genomic approaches, we investigated signatures of selection on imprinted genes across the Brassicaceae family and in autogamous and allogamous populations of Arabidopsis lyrata, and searched for evidence of coevolution among imprinted genes. We found that endosperm-expressed genes exhibited signals of balancing selection across Brassicaceae and within allogamous populations, consistent with unresolved intralocus conflicts. Supporting the kinship theory, these signals varied with mating system. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses further indicated negative directional selection acting on imprinted genes. However, population-level signals were independent of mating system and showed limited concordance with kinship predictions, possibly due to stronger selection acting on expression than on coding sequences. Finally, we identified coevolution between imprinted genes, although not at specific sites, suggesting that interactions beyond protein sequence drive this process.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

To quantify phenotypic adaptation in BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma, we develop a theoretical model informed by growth-rate data of WM239A-BRAFV600E cells challenged with the BRAF-inhibitor encorafenib. We use an individual-based model (IBM) in which each cell is described by one of multiple discrete and plastic phenotype states that are directly linked to drug-dependent net growth rates and, by extension, drug resistance. To describe how cells transition between phenotype states, we explore a gamut of candidate models common in the mathematical biology literature. Comparing these on their ability to reproduce in vitro growth curves, data-matched simulations suggest that phenotypic adaptation is directed towards states of high net growth rates, enabling the evasion of drug-effects. The model subsequently provides an explanation for when and why intermittent treatments outperform continuous treatments in the studied system, and demonstrates the benefits of not only targeting, but also leveraging, phenotypic adaptation in treatment protocols. Building on the IBM, we present a flexible mathematical methodology based on ordinary differential equations to compare responses to continuous and intermittent treatments through long-term effective net growth rates.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Studies often characterize biodiversity patterns along urban-rural gradients with statistical models that include one or more generic indices of urbanization. Such models may be useful for prediction, but they do not permit explicit tests of causal hypotheses by which urbanization mediates ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we show how a graphical causal modeling framework with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to design clear conceptual models and inform appropriate statistical analysis to better evaluate mechanistic hypotheses about the effects of urbanization on biodiversity. We first introduce the basic structure of DAGs and illustrate their value with simulated datasets. We then apply the framework to a case study on coat color variation in eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) along an urbanization gradient in Syracuse, New York, USA. We show how statistical models ungrounded in causal assumptions are difficult to interpret and can lead to misleading conclusions about mechanisms in urban ecology and evolution. In contrast, DAGs - by making causal assumptions transparent - help researchers identify appropriate control variables for statistical models to estimate the effects of interest. When applied to our case study, statistical models informed by a DAG revealed a surprising finding: although squirrel melanism was more prevalent in urban than rural populations, the prevalence of melanism was constrained by components of environmental change common to cities, namely roads, forest loss, and predator activity, contrary to expectations. Managing biodiversity in an increasingly urbanized world will require a mechanistic understanding of how urbanization impacts biodiversity patterns; graphical causal models such as DAGs can provide a powerful approach to do so.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Although LPS/LOS is typically essential, A. baumannii can survive without LOS, offering the opportunity to examine how the Gram-negative envelope remains stable in the absence of this major glycolipid. We previously found that the peptidoglycan biogenesis protein NlpD, an activator of peptidoglycan degradation by cell division amidases, is critical for fitness during LOS-deficiency. Here we show that NlpD is required under these conditions because a second putative amidase activator, WthA (cell wall turnover hub protein A), no longer functions in LOS-deficient cells. Mutants lacking WthA exhibited severe cell-division defects and were synthetically sick with loss of NlpD. Acinetobacter lack canonical periplasmic amidases, raising the question of which enzymes partner with NlpD and WthA. Previous work showed that overexpression of an Acinetobacter beta-lactamase increased denuded peptidoglycan, a product of amidase activity. Guided by this finding, we examined the chromosomally encoded beta-lactamase Oxa51 and found that its co-expression with WthA or NlpD enhanced release of amidase products, suggesting that Oxa51 participates in peptidoglycan degradation and that WthA is an amidase activator. Further, WthA influenced peptidoglycan endopeptidases and lytic transglycosylases through a network of protein interactions.

According to Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, both alleles of a TSG must typically be inactivated for tumorigenesis to proceed, whereas a single activating mutation can drive an OG. However, this diploid framework overlooks the distinct evolutionary dynamics of sex chromosomes. In males, the hemizygous (functionally haploid) state of the X chromosome implies that only a single mutational \"hit\" is needed to disable an X-linked TSG, potentially accelerating its contribution to cancer development. Here, we integrate somatic population genetics models with whole-genome mutation data to investigate how ploidy and dominance shape somatic evolution. We show that X-linked TSGs in male tumours evolve significantly faster than autosomal TSGs, particularly in highly proliferative tissues, whereas in low-proliferation tumours autosomal OGs accumulate mutations more rapidly than X-linked OGs. We further demonstrate that fixation times of advantageous mutations differ systematically between OGs and TSGs, converging only for male X-linked genes, as predicted from mathematical models. Our findings reveal that haploidy of sex chromosomes fundamentally alters the dynamics predicted by the two-hit hypothesis, providing the first systematic evidence that chromosomal context biases cancer gene evolution.

Yet how progenitors generate distinct but functionally related subtypes remains unknown. In the Drosophila lamina (five lamina neuron subtypes receiving photoreceptor input), we uncover the regulatory logic: a pan-class homeodomain transcription factor (HDTF), induced by Hedgehog in progenitors and maintained in all lamina neurons, drives diversification within the lamina neuron class by orchestrating a four-step program across the progenitor-to-newborn neuron transition. Specifically, it establishes progenitor identity, promotes cell-cycle exit, induces subtype-specific HDTFs, and acts as their obligate cofactor to specify distinct subtypes. Loss of subtype-specific HDTFs in newborn, but not older, neurons drives subtype-to-subtype fate conversions at molecular, morphological, and functional levels, including a contrast-to-luminance encoding switch. In the mouse retina, we find that each of the 63 amacrine, 15 bipolar, and 45 retinal ganglion cell subtypes expresses pan-class and subtype-specific HDTFs, indicating evolutionary conservation of this regulatory logic. Given the brain-wide expression of HDTFs across species, these findings convert a longstanding mystery into a testable, generalizable principle for within-class subtype diversification and lay the groundwork for subtype-precise reprogramming and cell replacement strategies.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Despite this challenge, the uridine analogue 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) has been commercialized and routinely used as specific label for nascent RNAs. Here, we employ confocal imaging, flow cytometry and biochemistry methods to study the specificity of EU to label RNA in six different animal species. We demonstrate that EU integrates as expected predominantly into RNA of a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293), the Drosophila wing disc and the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi.

In Nematostella, we show that inhibiting RNR by hydroxyurea abolishes cell proliferation and the incorporation of EU into DNA. Alternative compounds for labelling nascent RNA, such as 5-ethynyl cytidine (EC), 5-ethynyl uridine triphosphate (EUTP) or 2-ethynyl adenosine (EA) show similarly low specificity for RNA in Nematostella. Our findings raise concerns about the specificity of ethynylated nucleosides and nucleotides, including EU, to label RNA in some animals.

Here we analyze T cell receptor (TCR) $\\beta$ repertoires from 30,000 individuals and find that TCR diversity, essential for recognizing and eliminating malignant cells, declines with age. This immune decline occurs 11 years later in females and coincides with their lower cancer incidence, suggesting a biological connection. To test this link, we formalize immunoediting as a quantitative model of carcinogenesis, relating the measured age-associated decline in TCR diversity to rising cancer incidence. We find that both mutational and immune processes shape cancer risk, with lower incidence in females attributable to delayed immune decline. Extending this analysis across subtypes uncovers structured patterns in cancer incidence that reflect the relative contributions of these processes. Cancers cluster along an emergent immune-mutation axis that aligns with known features of cancer biology and indicates convergent evolutionary dynamics. Together, our results establish a quantitative, population-level framework for immunoediting that connects direct measurements of immune competence to cancer risk, integrating the molecular mechanisms, evolutionary dynamics and incidence patterns of cancer to reveal a fundamental balance between mutation and immunity that underlies carcinogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Leveraging the advancements in third-generation sequencing, we investigated the methylation patterns of non-reference insertions of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), particularly polymorphic transposable elements (TEs). We validated the high concordance between long-read methylation calls and conventional whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) method. By characterizing thousands of polymorphic TE insertions genome-wide using long reads from the draft Human Pangenome Reference, we aimed to establish general rules of TE methylation by addressing three key questions: 1) what is the methylation profile of each insertion? 2) do newly inserted TEs adopt the methylation pattern of their genomic context? and 3) do new TE insertions affect the methylation of their flanking regions? While most non-TE insertions exhibit DNA methylation patterns consistent with their genomic context, TE insertions are generally highly methylated, exhibiting distinct, class-specific patterns, and with profound variation within TE bodies. A small percentage of Alu insertions are hypomethylated, particularly those inserted within hypomethylated CpG islands. By comparing DNA methylation of flanking regions of TE insertions between individuals with and without the TE insertions, we revealed that majority of TEs exhibited minimal impact on nearby regions, although numerous exceptions exist where the methylation status of both L1 and Alu insertions leak into nearby regions, leading to either methylation spreading or hypomethylation sloping shores. In conclusion, we demonstrated the methylation calling capability of third-generation sequencing and its unique advantage in characterizing epigenomic features within non-reference positions. While TE insertions primarily exhibit methylation patterns restricted within their boundaries, some TEs are able to engage in context-dependent complex interactions with genomic neighborhood.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Nearly 800 inteins were retrieved through this process; the majority of which were previously unreported. We describe the nature of these inteins, their classes, integration target sites, distribution within phage clusters, and explore the geographical location of nearly identical intein sequences found in divergent exteins. Our findings suggest that these inteins recently invaded local phage populations. We also find two instances of a Cas4 exonuclease intein evolving from a terminase intein, and propose a model by which one of these inteins was able to utilize sequence similarity conferred by a shared nucleotide binding site to jump between genes. Additionally, we find inteins with never-before reported homing endonucleases, and inteins with homing endonucleases encoded in a reading frame separate from that which encodes the extein and the intein's self-splicing domains. We provide predicted structures for these elements and hypothesize on their evolution and relation to free-standing homing endonucleases within phage genomes.

Here, low-detail refers to resolutions {approx} 2.5-3.5[A], where the location of the phosphate groups and the glycosidic bonds can be determined from experimental maps but all other backbone atom positions cannot. In contrast, higher-resolution maps allow high-detail determinations of all backbone atomic positions. To this end, we first create a gold standard dataset of highly curated, experimentally supported RNA suites. Second, we develop and employ a modified version of the previously devised algorithm MINT-AGE to learn clusters that are in high correspondence with the gold standard's conformational classes of suites based on 3D RNA structure. Since some of the gold standard classes are of very small size, a new modified version of MINT-AGE is able to also identify very small clusters. Third, we create a new conformer prediction algorithm, RNAprecis, which assigns low-detail structures to newly designed 3D shape coordinates. Our improvements include: (i) learned classes augmented to cover also very low sample sizes and (ii) replacing distances from clusters by Bayesian posterior probabilities. On test data containing suites modeled as conformational outliers, RNAprecis shows good results suggesting that our learning method generalizes well. In particular, we show that the modified MINT-AGE clustering can more finely delineate between previously unseen suite conformer separations. For example, the 0a conformer has been separated into two clusters seen in different structural contexts.

In this study, we examined synchronization of brain activity, heart rate, and electrodermal activity between participants while they listened to engaging and non-engaging stories. Subjective engagement ratings were collected as a ground truth reference. Results showed higher interpersonal synchronization across all modalities when participants listened to engaging stories compared to non-engaging ones, with significant correlations between synchronization measures and ratings of subjective engagement.

We further investigated the developmental trajectory of amygdala across social grades and found that intolerant species showed a gradual increase in relative amygdala volume across the lifespan. Unexpectedly, tolerant species exhibited a decrease in relative amygdala volume across the lifespan, contrasting with the age-related increase observed in intolerant species, a developmental pattern previously undescribed in primates.

These sources can originate from distinct channels, such as internally maintained latent cognitive representations or externally presented sensory cues. Because these signals are often stochastic and carry inherent uncertainty, integration is challenging. However, the neural and computational mechanisms that support the integration of such stochastic information remain unknown. We introduce a computational neuroimaging framework to elucidate how brain systems integrate internally maintained and externally cued stochastic information to guide behavior. Neuroimaging data were collected from healthy adult human participants (both male and female). Our computational model estimates trial-by-trial beliefs about internally maintained latent states and externally presented perceptual cues, then integrates them into a unified joint probability distribution. The entropy of this joint distribution quantifies overall uncertainty, which enables continuous tracking of probabilistic task beliefs, prediction errors, and updating dynamics. Results showed that latent-state beliefs are encoded in distinct regions from perceptual beliefs. Latent-state beliefs were encoded in the anterior middle frontal gyrus, mediodorsal thalamus, and inferior parietal lobule, whereas perceptual beliefs were encoded in spatially distinct regions including lateral temporo-occipital areas, intraparietal sulcus, and precentral sulcus. The integrated joint probability and its entropy converged in frontoparietal hub areas, notably middle frontal gyrus and intraparietal sulcus.

Although co-occurring taxa have long been appreciated to undergo HGT more often, this association is confounded with other factors, most notably their phylogenetic relatedness. To disentangle these factors, we analyzed 15,339 marine prokaryotic genomes (mainly bacteria) and their distribution in the global ocean. We identified HGT events across these genomes and enrichments for functions previously shown to be prone to HGT. By mapping metagenomic reads from 1,862 ocean samples to these genomes, we also identified co-occurrence patterns and environmental associations. Although we observed an expected negative association between HGT rates and phylogenetic distance, we only detected an association between co-occurrence and phylogenetic distance for closely related taxa. This observation refines the previously reported trend to closely related taxa, rather than a consistent pattern across all taxonomic levels, at least here within marine environments. In addition, we identified a significant association between co-occurrence and HGT, which remains even after controlling for phylogenetic distance and measured environmental variables. In a subset of samples with extended environmental data, we identified higher HGT levels associated with particle-attached bacteria and associations of varying directions with specific environmental variables, such as chlorophyll a and photosynthetically available radiation.

Several recent studies have demonstrated performance gains from pretraining neural foundation models on multi-session datasets, seemingly overcoming this challenge. However, these studies typically lack fine-grained data scaling analyses. It remains unclear how different sources of heterogeneity influence model performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, and whether all sessions contribute equally to downstream performance gains. In this work, we systematically investigate how data heterogeneity impacts the scaling behavior of neural data transformers (NDTs) in neural activity prediction. We found that explicit sources of heterogeneity, such as brain region mismatches among sessions, reduced scaling benefits of neuron- and region-level activity prediction performances. For tasks that do exhibit consistent scaling, we identified implicit data heterogeneity arising from cross-session variability. Through our proposed session-selection procedure, models pretrained on as few as five selected sessions outperformed those pretrained on the entire dataset of 84 sessions. Our findings challenge the direct applicability of traditional scaling laws to neural data and suggest that prior claims of multi-session scaling benefits may be premature.

These cycles require conformational transitions of Hsp70 driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis. The ATPase activity of Hsp70 is controlled by J-domain protein (JDP) cochaperones, which allosterically stimulate ATP hydrolysis via interactions between their J-domains and Hsp70. The J-domain binds at the interface between the nucleotide (NBD) and substrate (SBD) binding domains of ATP bound Hsp70. Although, it was established that the JD interaction involves residues of helices II and III, and the interhelical loop critical for ATPase stimulation, the mechanism by which the allosteric signal induced by J-domain binding is transmitted to the distal nucleotide-binding pocket of Hsp70 remains unclear, as do the conformational changes leading to the ATP hydrolysis. Here, we addressed these questions by means of all-atom free energy simulations and dynamic network analysis, starting from the crystal structures of ATP-bound Hsp70 DnaK alone and in complex with the J-domain of DnaJ. We demonstrated that the presence of the J-domain results in the rearrangement of the nucleotide-binding pocket into a hydrolysis competent state, characterized by close contact between universally conserved T199 of NBD and {gamma}-phosphate of ATP. With network analysis we revealed that the allosteric signal for this rearrangement is transmitted along the {beta}-strand containing T199. Finally, we provide rationale for the signal transmission, where steric repulsion between the J-domain's helix III and SBD induces a push of the T199 containing {beta}-strand.

In Drosophila, patterned stimulus independent neural activity (PSINA) engages the entire brain in highly stereotyped, globally coordinated cycles of activity. A molecularly-defined population of ~2,000 neurons (Transient Receptor Potential Gamma, Trp{gamma}+ neurons) act as an activity template for PSINA. We show that this activity template is patterned by four neurons expressing the neuropeptide SIFamide (SIFa).

In turn, Trp{gamma}+ neurons regulate SIFa neuron activity through a recurrent interaction. Neuropeptides act through synapse-free, or wireless, signaling; a fitting mode of communication for a process tasked with refining on-going synapse formation. By placing neuropeptide signaling at the core of developmental activity, this work highlights the rich neurophysiological potential of the chemical connectome in shaping the developing brain.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Populations of neurons in motor cortex signal voluntary movement. Most classic neural encoding models and current brain-computer interface decoders assume individual neurons sum together along a neural dimension to represent movement features such as velocity or force. However, large population neural analyses continue to identify trajectories of neural activity evolving with time that traverse multiple dimensions. Explanations for these neural trajectories typically focus on how cortical circuits learn, organize, and implement movements. However, descriptions of how these neural trajectories might improve performance, and specifically motor precision, are lacking. In this study, we proposed and tested a computational model that highlights the role of neural trajectories, through the selective co-activation and selective timing of firing rates across the neural populations, for improving motor precision. Our model uses experimental results from a center-out reaching task as inspiration to create several physiologically realistic models for the neural encoding of movement. Using a recurrent neural network to simulate how a downstream population of neurons might receive such information, like the spinal cord and motor units, we show that movements are more accurate when neural information specific to the phase and/or amplitude of movement are incorporated across time instead of an instantaneous, linear tuning model. Our finding suggests that precise motor control arises from spatiotemporal recruitment of neural populations that create distinct neural trajectories. We anticipate our results will significantly impact not only how neural encoding of movement in motor cortex is described but also future understating for how brain networks communicate information for planning and executing movements. Our model also provides potential inspiration for how to incorporate selective activation across a neural population to improve future brain-computer interfaces.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Pathogens acquire AMR much faster than we discover new drugs (antibiotics), warranting innovative methods to better understand its molecular underpinnings. Traditional approaches for detecting AMR in novel bacterial strains are time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, advances in sequencing technology offer a plethora of bacterial genome data, and computational approaches like machine learning (ML) provide an optimistic scope for in silico AMR prediction. Here, we introduce a comprehensive multiscale ML approach to predict AMR phenotypes and identify AMR molecular features associated with a single drug or drug family, stratified by time and geographical locations. As a case study, we focus on a subset of the World Health Organization's Bacterial Priority Pathogens, the frequently drug-resistant and nosocomial ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species. We started with sequenced genomes with lab-derived AMR phenotypes, constructed pangenomes, clustered gene and protein sequences, and extracted protein domains to generate pangenomic features across molecular scales. To uncover the molecular mechanisms behind drug-/drug class-specific resistance, we trained logistic regression ML models on our datasets. These yielded ranked lists of AMR-associated genes, proteins, and domains. In addition to recapitulating known AMR features, our models identified novel candidates for experimental validation. The models were performant across molecular scales, data types, and drugs while achieving a median normalized Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.89. Prediction performance showed resilience even when evaluated on geographical and temporal holdouts. We also evaluated model generalizability and cross-resistance across the drug-/drug class-specific models cross-tested on other available drug-/drug class genomes. Finally, we uncovered multiple drug class resistance features using multiclass and multilabel models. Our holistic approach promises reliable prediction of existing and developing resistance in newly sequenced pathogen genomes, while pinpointing the mechanistic molecular contributors of AMR.

GLP-1-based drugs have massively transformed care, but long-term consequences are unclear in part due to reductions in energy expenditure with ongoing use. Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and cold exposure (CE) raise EE via brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT). Methionine restriction (MetR) is a candidate DIT stimulus, but its EE effect has not been benchmarked against CE, nor have their tissue-level interactions been defined. Objective & Methods: In a 2*2 design (Control vs. MetR; room temperature, RT: 22 C vs. CE: 4 C for 24 h), we used male C57BL/6N mice to benchmark MetR-induced thermogenesis against CE and mapped how diet and temperature interact across tissues. Bulk RNA-seq profiled liver, iBAT, iWAT, and eWAT. Differential expression was modeled with main effects and a diet:temperature interaction. KEGG GSEA was used to assess pathway-level enrichment. Results: MetR increased EE at RT and shifted fuel use towards lipid oxidation, supporting MetR as a bona fide DIT stimulus. CE elevated EE across diets and blunted diet differences. Transcriptomic responses were tissue-specific: in liver, CE dominated gene induction while MetR and CE cooperatively repressed genes. The combination enriched glucagon/AMPK-linked and core metabolic pathways. In iBAT, CE dominated thermogenic and lipid-oxidation programs with minimal MetR contribution. In iWAT, MetR and CE acted largely additively with high concordance, enhancing fatty-acid degradation, PPAR signaling, thermogenesis, and TCA cycle pathways. In eWAT, robust co-dependent and synergistic differential expression emerged only with MetR+CE. Conclusion: MetR is a genuine DIT stimulus that remodels metabolism in a tissue-specific manner. Our study provides a tissue-resolved transcriptomic resource that benchmarks diet-induced (MetR) against cold-induced thermogenesis and maps their interactions across liver, iBAT, iWAT, and eWAT.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Neither the factors that control strength of interference, nor the extent to which they vary within and between species, are well understood. Here we confirm that that crossover interference is stronger in male than in female meiosis in house mice (Mus musculus), provide the first estimate of the proportion of non-interfering crossovers in female mice, and show that this proportion is lower than in males. Interference is stronger on shorter chromosomes in both sexes, but the frequency of interference escape is similar across the range of chromosome size. Together with evidence that interference varies across strains and subspecies, our results provide a foundation for studying the evolution and sexual dimorphism in this important feature of meiosis in mice.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Recent work indicates that the RE plays a critical role in the acquisition and retrieval of fear extinction memories. Functional inactivation of the RE impairs both mPFC-HPC coherence and extinction memory. Here we examine whether imposing theta activity on the RE entrains oscillations in the mPFC and HPC and facilitates extinction learning. Methods: To deliver theta-paced (8 Hz) optogenetic stimulation, we expressed an excitatory opsin, (channelrhodopsin; AAV9-CaMKIIa-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry) or control virus (AAV9-CaMKIIa-mCherry) in the RE in male and female rats. A single optic fiber targeting the RE was implanted during the same surgery. After recovery, animals underwent auditory fear conditioning, extinction training, and an extinction retrieval test, each separated by 24-h. During extinction training, conditioned stimuli (CS) presentations were paired with 8-Hz sinusoidal optostimulation (473 nM, 10 mW) of the RE. In another experiment, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the mPFC and dorsal HPC during using these behavioral procedures. Results: Theta-paced stimulation of the RE during extinction training significantly decreased freezing behavior compared to the control group. Notably, the reduction in conditioned behavior was evident during the subsequent stimulation-free retrieval test. This reveals that RE stimulation during extinction not only suppresses conditioned fear responses acutely, but also facilitates the acquisition of long-term extinction memories. Theta-paced RE stimulation markedly enhanced both neural activity and entrained theta oscillations in the mPFC and dHPC. Conclusion: This work suggests that the RE oscillatory activity is critical for the acquisition of extinction memories through the modulation of hippocampal-prefrontal network dynamics. In the future, RE theta-paced stimulation can be an important therapeutic tool by strengthening extinction memories.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Deep sequencing of barcodes revealed preferred enrichment of early-disseminated clones across metastatic niches. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with RNA velocity analyses in ascites and metastasis-bearing omenta uncovered an emergent and distinct interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}) centric transcriptional trajectory, enriched among early seeding clones.

We show that the p48 isoform of ITAF45, but not the p42 isoform, is crucial for efficient EMCV/Mengovirus replication and for propagation of replicons in human cell culture. Loss of ITAF45 markedly diminishes EMCV and FMDV IRES activities, which can be rescued by re-expression of ITAF45-p48. Interestingly, cell-free translation assays reveal that EMCV IRES activity is less ITAF45-dependent in vitro, in contrast to FMDV, raising questions about the versatile functions of ITAFs in IRES-driven translation.

This study aimed to determine whether these farming practices differentially affect body mass, coloration intensity, and sperm quality in passerine birds inhabiting agricultural landscapes. We captured seven passerine species in hedgerows adjacent to fields farmed organically or conventionally, within a 250 meter radius representative of their breeding home ranges. Body mass was measured across all species, and an index of coloration intensity, based on carotenoid (yellow/orange) and melanin (black) pigments, was assessed in four species. Additionally, we evaluated three sperm quality parameters (sperm density, percentage of abnormal sperm, and intra individual variance of sperm morphology) using fresh sperm samples collected from four species in the field. We hypothesized that birds living near conventional fields would exhibit lower body mass due to reduced food availability. Additionally, we predicted that the more favourable conditions associated with organic farming, such as greater food abundance and lower exposure to pollutants, would benefit birds, leading to enhanced coloration and improved sperm quality. Our results did not reveal any difference in body mass or coloration. The absence of observable effects might be due to several factors: methodological limitations, cross contamination between habitats or insufficient exposure to farming practices that may hide any potential difference between the two habitats, or the intrinsic adaptive strategies of the species. However, subgroup analysis of three and four species revealed a decrease in sperm density and a higher proportion of abnormal spermatozoa in the Common Whitethroat and Common Nightingale living in conventional farming, respectively.

We introduce In-Pocket, a quantum mechanical optimisation method biased by experimental data that resolves the chemical nature of protein-ligand binding interfaces. In-Pocket improves model quality, corrects chemically inconsistent structures, and identifies the energetically most favourable conformers within biomacromolecular complexes. Further, it generalises across a wide range of systems, including those containing transition metals. Benchmarking demonstrates that In-Pocket enhances the reliability of legacy and newly solved structures. With automated and simple-to-use routine chemical validation, In-Pocket stands to improve the integrity of structural databases and impact diverse domains: from molecular biology to rational drug design and application of generative AI.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Prognosis is currently assessed using cytogenetic biomarkers and measurable residual disease (MRD) after one chemotherapy cycle, with the highest-risk patients referred for stem cell transplantation (SCT) in first remission. Because aggressive therapies such as SCT are highly toxic, yet cures after relapse are rare, accurate early risk prediction is essential for improving outcomes. To address this need, we analyzed paired diagnosis-relapse samples from 33 pAML patients at single-cell resolution and identified chemoresistant populations whose abundance at diagnosis significantly improved risk prediction. Incorporating these populations into a risk model revealed a previously unrecognized subgroup, representing 20% of pAML cases and accounting for half of the deaths among patients who were not prescribed SCT in first remission, with a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) below 40%. Moreover, molecular characterization of these chemoresistant cell populations uncovered potential therapeutic targets and candidate interventions relevant to most high-risk patients, paving the way for more effective targeted treatments for high-risk pAML patients.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

However, structural variation, such as gene duplications and deletions, can also reshape genomes and drive rapid phenotypic change. Yet, how these classes of mutations jointly influence long-term adaptation remains unclear. Here we evolve six replicate diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations for 1200 generations in either glucose or galactose and show that adaptation is dominated by large-scale copy number variations (CNVs) rather than single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In glucose, adaptation proceeds through early, extensive telomeric deletions that target carbon-use modules, followed by later compensatory duplications that restore metabolic breadth. In galactose, adaptation is marked instead by persistent telomeric and subtelomeric duplications that reinforce specialization. Opposing selection acted on overlapping sets of genes, with loci deleted during glucose adaptation becoming duplicated during galactose adaptation, linking structural remodeling to divergent physiological strategies. Contrary to models emphasizing SNP accumulation, these findings demonstrate that predictable CNV trajectories dominate genome evolution in stable environments, and that the direction and persistence of such structural changes are constrained by both the ancestral genotype and the regulatory architecture of the cell.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

W.; Lu, T.; Bhatti, S.; Kouba, P.; Huang, P.-S.", "abstract": "Structure-conditioned sequence design models aim to design a protein sequence that will fold into a given target structure. Deep-learning-based approaches for sequence design have proven highly successful for various protein design applications, but many non-idealized backbones still remain out of reach for current models under typical in silico success criteria. We hypothesize that training objectives prioritizing native sequence recovery unintentionally push models to reproduce non-structural signals (e.g. phylogenetic relatedness, neutral drift, or dataset sampling biases), rather than a broadly generalizable structure-sequence mapping. Inspired by recent work bridging sequence likelihood and fitness prediction in protein language models, we introduce Caliby, a Potts model-based sequence design method capable of conditioning on an ensemble of structures. Conditioning on a synthetic ensemble generated from an input backbone allows sampling of sequences consistent with the structural constraints of the ensemble while averaging out undesired biases towards the native sequence. Ensemble-conditioned sequence design with Caliby reduces native sequence recovery while substantially improving AlphaFold2 self-consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art models ProteinMPNN and ChromaDesign on both native and de novo backbones. Finally, we train a variant of Caliby on only soluble proteins and demonstrate in silico that Protpardelle-1c binder designs that were previously deemed undesignable by SolubleMPNN are actually designable under SolubleCaliby, highlighting limitations of existing filtering pipelines.

Current conceptualizations of episodic and semantic memory interactions emphasize a one-way consolidation from episodic traces in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to semantic knowledge in neocortex (CTX). However, this tradition has left largely unexplored how semantic memory may affect episodic encoding of new memories. Here we introduce a cognitive model in which the code used in episodic memories shifts from purely sensorial to including explicit semantic representations of stored events. Simultaneously, we propose a computational circuit model of how such a cognitive strategy could be implemented in the brain using biologically-plausible learning rules. We show that increased sparsity during replay enables neocortex to extract compositional structure from overlapping episodes, which creates a dictionary of inter-connected concepts in semantic memory. Furthermore, we show that spontaneous activity in neocortical areas can imprint the abstracted representations into the medial temporal lobe, giving rise to concept-like cells. This bidirectional interaction improves episodic recall and replay fidelity, and facilitates the consolidation of higher-order representations based on previous semantic knowledge. The model accounts for behavioural advantages of schema-congruent learning, the emergence of concept neurons, and enhanced memory performance for semantically familiar stimuli. Together, our results provide a mechanistic account of how episodes and concepts reinforce each other, extending standard consolidation theories and suggesting a cooperative framework where semantic knowledge scaffolds episodic encoding, which in turn favours compositional abstraction.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

In this paper we develop a spiking network that consists of populations of E, I and an additional interneuron type, the somatostatin (S) internerons that receive excitation from the E cells and inhibit both the E cells and the I cells. These S cells are modulated by a third inhibitory subtype, VIP neurons that receive inputs from other cortical areas. We reduce the spiking network to a system of nine differential equations that characterize the mean voltage, firing rate, and synaptic conductance for each population and using this we find many instances of multiple rhythms within the network. Using tools from nonlinear dynamics, we explore the roles of each of the two classes of inhibition as well as the role of the VIP modulation on the properties of these rhythms.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Twenty percent of patients survive beyond three years, but known clinical factors like age, performance status, resection extent, and MGMT promoter methylation status do not fully explain the observed outcomes. Objective: Our objective was to identify novel histology derived biomarkers associated with end-of-spectrum overall survival (OS) to provide novel biological insight with a translational potential. Methods: We analyzed a total of 748 GBM patients from 3 different cohorts, uniquely enriched in long survivors (n=98 with overall survival (OS) > 5y including n=196 with OS[&ge;]3y), with clinical data and H&E slides obtained from the primary tumor at baseline. We propose an interpretable machine learning (ML) methodology for the discovery of histological biomarkers. Our method learned to segment each H&E slide into three distinct regions associated with long-term survival, short-term survival, and non-informative tissue. We characterized these regions by integrating unsupervised learning, nuclei segmentation, blood vessels detection, pathologist annotations, and multimodal data including spatial transcriptomics from n=31 patients of the GBM MOSAIC dataset to discover fully interpretable biomarkers. Results: Our OS prediction model using histology and clinical data as input achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 for the classification of patients between OS<2 and OS[&ge;]3y in external cohort validation, outperforming significantly models trained on clinical data or on histology alone (AUC of 0.76; 0.73, respectively). Two novel biomarkers were predicting poor survival: the presence of regions of lowly infiltrated white matter enriched in malignant cells with a mesenchymal-like phenotype, and lower levels of angiogenesis associated with higher hypoxia response in the main tumor regions. We also found that a subtype of immunosuppressive tumor macrophages - defined by high PLIN2 expression and lipid accumulation- is consistently enriched in histological areas predictive of poor prognosis. Conclusion: Our interpretable ML methodology identified a novel prognostic impact of biological processes and cell types according to distinct tumor regions of GBM.

However, the intrinsic spatiotemporal dynamics of SAR in human placentation remain poorly understood, largely due to the limited availability of high-quality maternal-fetal interface specimens. Electively terminated early pregnancies offer a valuable resource for studying SAR in situ, yet inconsistent methods for distinguishing fragmented villous and decidual tissues have hindered reproducibility and interpretation. Herein we present a standardized protocol for the classification and characterization of high-quality maternal-fetal interface specimens from elective terminations by integrating stereomicroscopic evaluation with confirmation by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Combined with multiplex immunofluorescence imaging with cell-type- specific markers, this approach enabled precise spatial mapping and quantification of key morphological and cellular events in SAR from gestational weeks 5 to 10. Our analyses reveal that SAR initiates as early as week 5 with extraluminal recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells, followed by the formation of tightly packed EVT plugs within the lumens of spiral arteries in the decidua compacta; these plugs progressively extend deeper into the vessels and gradually loosen as gestation progresses. Notably, enEVTs appear to acquire NK cell-like phenotypes that may facilitate the displacement of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, promoting progressive vessel dilation. In summary, we provide a robust and reproducible method for assessing physiological SAR in early human pregnancy, promoting the adoption of our methodology in future studies of pathological SAR and related pregnancy disorders.\n\nSummary SentenceA standardized protocol for classifying maternal-fetal interface specimens from electively aborted materials at gestational weeks 5-10 was developed to quantify the spatiotemporal spiral artery remodeling dynamics in early human pregnancy.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=171 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/682615v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@78e7d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc2722org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad2b18org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e8502f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Mutations in SOD1 are a leading genetic cause of familial ALS, driving motor neuron degeneration through toxic gain-of-function mechanisms. While gene silencing strategies targeting SOD1 hold therapeutic promise, their clinical translation has been hindered by inefficient delivery to the spinal cord and safety concerns associated with conventional viral vectors. Here, we report a minimally invasive gene therapy strategy that combines the retrograde transport capability of rAAV2-retro with the safety of an artificial microRNA (miRNA) to achieve pan-spinal SOD1 suppression. A single intramuscular injection of rAAV2-retro-miRNA into neonatal SOD1G93A mice resulted in widespread transduction of spinal motor neurons, significant reduction of mutant SOD1 protein, and multifaceted therapeutic benefits. Treated mice exhibited delayed disease onset, extended survival, preserved motor function, reduced neuroinflammation, and protection of neuromuscular junctions and spinal motor neurons. Importantly, the artificial miRNA platform demonstrated a superior safety profile compared to shRNA-based constructs, which caused severe toxicity and lethality in wild-type mice.

We find that loss of TRIM28 has a limited effect on global transposon expression and instead results in upregulation of genes proximal to TRIM28-bound Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) in both human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). MER11A elements show especially strong regulatory importance in hTSCs: these elements are bound by both TRIM28 and placental transcription factors and show both heterochromatic and euchromatic features. Some genes are positively regulated by MER11A elements in hTSC basal state, while other MER11A-proximal genes show upregulation only upon TRIM28 deletion. By contrast, loss of DNA methylation in hESCs or hTSCs leads to a global increase in transposon expression. While many genic 5mC targets are shared in hESCs and hTSCs, we also observe evidence that a handful of genes important for somatic development are repressed by 5mC in trophoblast, while a small parallel set of placental genes are repressed by methylation in embryonic tissue. Interestingly, loss of DNMT1 causes hESCs to be rapidly lost from culture in a TP53 and mitotic surveillance checkpoint-dependent manner, while hTSCs show little p53 response to DNMT1 loss or DNA damage generally, instead showing gradual mitotic defects and aneuploidy and slow loss from culture. This discrepancy may explain the higher frequency of karyotypic abnormality found in human placental cells.

NPTX2 RNA and protein were significantly reduced in AD, and to a lesser extent in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) samples. RNA expression of BDNF, VGF, SST, and SCG2 correlated with both NPTX2 mRNA and protein levels. We identified NPTX2-correlated synaptic and mitochondrial programs that were negatively correlated with lysosomal and chromatin/stress modules. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of NPTX2 correlations across all samples confirmed broad alignment with synaptic and mitochondrial compartments, and more NPTX2-specific associations with proteostasis and translation regulator pathways, all of which were weakened in AD. In contrast, correlation of NPTX2 protein with transcriptomic profiles revealed negative associations with stress-linked transcription regulator RNAs (FOXJ1, ZHX3, SMAD5, JDP2, ZIC4), which were strengthened in AD.

This bottleneck limits the achievable throughput of structure determination, especially in high-throughput settings such as structure-based drug design. In this work, we develop an end-to-end automation strategy for repeat-target structure determination using new tools in CryoSPARC. We demonstrate completely hands-off processing of 21 challenging G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) datasets. In 17 of 21 cases, automated processing meets or exceeds published resolution and map quality and, in several cases, provides significant improvement in receptor and ligand density that allows improved model building. Our results on both active and inactive state GPCRs show that our automation strategy generalizes easily to new target classes, and that complete automation of data processing is straightforward to achieve in CryoSPARC. We provide downloadable CryoSPARC Workflow files so that users can import, replicate, adapt and extend our automated workflow for their own targets, enabling cryo-EM to be applied at larger scales and to answer larger biological questions.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Primary neuroblastomas are well-characterized, but the mechanisms underlying metastasis remain poorly understood. Here, by applying single-cell and spatial multi-omics analyses to primary and metastatic tumors, we found that lymph-node metastases in high-risk neuroblastomas display distinctive cellular heterogeneity and plasticity, marked by mesenchymal-like and stem-like states and heightened epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition activity compared to primary adrenal tumors. Additionally, compared to primary adrenal masses, the metastatic niche display increased immunosuppressive myeloid programs, heightened immune checkpoint signaling, and lymphocyte exhaustion, which are indicative of immune evasion and dysfunction. Notably, metastatic neuroblastomas show elevated eIF4F translation machinery and XPO1 levels. Dual inhibition of eIF4A and XPO1 synergistically halted tumor growth and prolonged survival in xenograft models.

Aging, the strongest risk factor for AD, is also associated with some overlapping processes, such as neuronal cell transcriptional downregulation and glial cell activation. The middle temporal gyrus (MTG) is a brain region that supports semantic processing and default-mode connectivity and shows early vulnerability in both aging and AD. Here we profile bulk RNA-seq from 606 postmortem MTG samples with the goal of understanding the transcriptional changes associated with AD and aging. In 217 clinical and neuropathologically confirmed AD versus 290 no-dementia controls donors, we identify 613 differentially expressed genes (390 up, 223 down; |og2 fold change [&ge;] 0.5; BH P < 0.05), with NPNT and ADAMTS2 among the top upregulated signals. Cell set enrichment indicates reduced excitatory neuronal signatures together with increased microglial, astrocytic, endothelial, and pericyte programs. Gene-set analyses reveal strong activation of angiogenesis, extracellular-matrix organization, wound response, adaptive immunity, and coordinated suppression of neuronal and mitochondrial processes, including synaptic signaling and respiratory-chain complexes. Multiscale coexpression mapping resolves three disease clusters: a neuron-mitochondrial module suppressed in AD (M5; hub PJA2; key driver GABRB3), a microglial immune module upregulated in AD (M6; hub C1QC; key driver FCER1G), and an increased astrocyte-vascular extracellular-matrix module in AD (M8; hub ESAM; key driver TAGLN). Across 324 non AD controls aged 24 to 108 years, aging is associated with declines in gene expression associated with translation, proteostasis, and mitochondrial function and increases in those linked to oligodendrocyte and myelination programs (for example M4; hub CNTN2; key driver MOBP); in a 65+ subset, neuronal and protein-folding modules show the strongest decrements with reduced glial gene expression upregulation. Our results indicate that late-life aging involves increased glial responses and neuronal/proteostasis suppression, whereas AD is also associated with immune-vascular-ECM activation and suppression of neuronal programs.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a second high-quality Denisovan genome, reconstructed from a molar found at Denisova Cave. It belonged to a man who lived ~200,000 years ago in a small Denisovan group. This group mixed with early Neandertals and was then replaced by Denisovans who had mixed with later Neandertals. We show that in addition Denisovans received gene flow from hominins that diverged before the split of the ancestors of Denisovans and modern humans. The two Denisovan genomes allow us to disentangle Denisovan ancestry in present-day humans revealing contributions from at least three distinct Denisovan groups. In particular, Oceanians and South Asians independently inherited DNA from a deeply diverged Denisovan population which was likely isolated in South Asia. This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route. Finally, the two high-quality Denisovan genomes allow us to refine the catalogue of genetic changes that arose on the Denisovan lineage, some of which were contributed to present-day humans.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

By preserving the core mathematical models of GATK HaplotypeCaller, Rovaca achieves nearly identical output, ensuring high concordance and facilitating adoption. Performance gains are achieved through a sophisticated producer-consumer multi-threading architecture and targeted micro-architectural optimizations of the PairHMM algorithm using AVX-512 instructions.

H.; Javadpour, A.", "abstract": "Correlation methods play an important role in machine learning. They apply as a similarity or distance measure in machine learning models such as recommender systems, clustering methods, and distance-based algorithms such as KNN, leading to more accurate and interpretable results. Pearson's correlation is one of the most common methods for measuring dependence between biological variables. However, it works well only when data are linearly associated and follow a normal distribution. In cancer, most molecules do not follow a normal distribution. A sudden increase or decrease of gene expression in high stages of cancer usually leads to exponential distribution. In such circumstances, rank-based correlations would be a better choice for association detection. Misusing the Pearson correlation coefficient in cases where data exhibit a non-linear relationship can lead to misleading results and incorrect interpretations such as the exclusion of important features and selection of inappropriate relationships. In this paper, we applied four correlation metrics to define the association between genes in cancer networks. There was a significant difference between the rate of survival-related hubs among Pearson's and Spearman's based networks. For instance, in BLCA, the rate of survival-related hubs was 81% for the Spearman-based network vs 68% for the Pearson-based network. This discrepancy was 53 % vs 42 % for KIRC. Furthermore, Spearman-based networks enriched more GO terms, and their cancer-related enriched GO terms were twice as many as those of Pearson's.

By leveraging a large collection of 85,364 metagenomic samples, we implemented multiple self-supervised learning methods, including masked autoencoders with varying masking rates and adapted single-cell RNA sequencing models (scVI and scGPT), to generate embeddings from bacterial abundance profiles. These learned representations demonstrated significant advantages over raw bacterial abundances in two key scenarios: first, when training predictive models with very limited labeled data, improving prediction performance for age (r = 0.14 vs. 0.06), BMI (r = 0.16 vs. 0.11), visceral fat mass (r = 0.25 vs. 0.18), and drug usage classification (PR-AUC = 0.81 vs. 0.73); and second, when generalizing predictions across different cohorts, consistently outperforming models based on raw abundances in cross-dataset evaluation.

Molecular so-called eat-me signals, mediating axon-SC/axon-Mph crosstalk and debris clearance after injury are just at the beginning of being identified. Herein, we describe the axonal node protein contactin-associated protein (CASPR) as a potential novel signal for axonal debris removal in peripheral nerve injury. In healthy nerves, CASPR is restricted to Ranvier's nodes interacting with glia-derived partner proteins to assure saltatory action potential propagation. In injured murine and human nerves, we describe upregulation and re-localization of CASPR protein along the axons. Enhanced CASPR presence after injury appears to involve local axonal translation rather than transcriptional regulation. Of note, CASPR overexpression in murine central and peripheral neurons in vitro has a growth inhibitory effect. More importantly, axonal debris deriving from injured nerves - and hence having increased CASPR content - are phagocytosed more efficiently than debris of healthy nerves. Interfering with CASPR by function-blocking antibodies strongly reduces axonal debris uptake. This finding demonstrates a functional relevance of CASPR as a potential eat me signal in this process.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

In addition to its well-known acute toxicity, exposure to CPF has also been linked to chronic conditions such as an increasing risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and adverse effects on gut health, including disturbances to the gut microbiome and metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism of CPF's contribution to ASD remains unclear, and the roles of the gut microbiome and gut metabolites in CPF-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity remain elusive. Using a high-throughput social behavior assay, we found that embryonic exposure to CPF induced lasting social deficits in zebrafish. Through a small-scale screen of common health beneficial gut microbiome metabolites, we discovered that butyrate effectively rescued CPF-induced social deficits. RNA sequencing of zebrafish brain tissues revealed that early exposure to CPF induced a lasting suppression of neuronal genes, including many ASD risk genes, and elevated expression of circadian genes. Butyrate partially reversed the suppression of key neuronal genes. Butyrate is a non-selective inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Through a series of loss-of-function experiments utilizing CRISPR-Cas9-induced knockouts and selective chemical inhibitors, we found that the class I HDAC, HDAC1, most likely mediates butyrate's rescue effect. Metabolomics analysis detected changes in several nitrogen metabolism-related pathways in the zebrafish gut following CPF exposure. Metagenomics analysis revealed an increase in abundance of the denitrifying bacteria Pseudomonas and a reduction in the nitric oxide-sensitive bacteria Aeromonas in the CPF-exposed zebrafish gut microbiome. Our results connect CPF-exposure with changes in the gut microbiome, metabolome, epigenetics, gene expression, and behavior, inspiring a novel hypothesis for the underlying molecular mechanisms of CPF-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity.

This process is dependent on the DNA damage response kinase, ATR, and occurs in both human and mouse cells. We show that ATR promotes CENP-A eviction by recruiting the AAA+ ATPase VCP to centromeres, destabilizing CENP-A containing nucleosomes. The canonical CENP-A chaperone, HJURP, but not H3 histone chaperones DAXX or ATRX, is necessary for nucleolar CENP-A localization. Importantly, ATR-dependent CENP-A eviction endures after cell-cycle re-entry and correlates with the emergence of acentric chromosomes, linking replication stress directly to segregation defects.

In contrast, pericentromeric TEs demonstrate autonomous heterochromatin formation, less dependently on these H2A variants. Furthermore, H2A.Z protects protein-coding genes from ectopic heterochromatin formation, possibly by preventing its spreading.

Some evidence indicates that bone loss slows in the period beyond 15 years after surgery; however, there is substantial uncertainty in clinical data. To explore the effects of surgically induced menopausal transition, here we propose a mathematical model for the bone cell dynamical responses to sudden estrogen deficiency, which extends an existing model for osteoporosis due to aging and natural menopause. Using data on the key impacts observed in female mice and humans after bilateral oophorectomy, this new model considers the role of osteocytes embedded within the bone mineralized matrix in regulating osteoclastogenesis, which results in increased bone resorption after surgical menopause. The values of model parameters in natural and surgical menopause were estimated from aggregated human clinical data from existing longitudinal studies.

Here, we combine high-resolution diffusion MRI, a novel fibre-tracking pipeline designed to specifically probe anatomical connectivity of the in vivo human hippocampus, and track-weighted dynamic functional connectivity (TW-dFC) to investigate how direct anatomical connections between the hippocampus and the rest of the brain relate to time-varying functional interactions. In Study 1, TW-dFC maps were computed for 10 participants from the Human Connectome Project and subjected to ICA and k-means clustering to derive a data-driven parcellation of the hippocampus based on its structure-function relationships. This revealed circumscribed clusters distributed along anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes, which broadly aligned with hippocampal subfields. In Study 2, we examined the resting-state functional connectivity profiles of each TW-dFC derived cluster in an independent sample of 100 participants. Each hippocampal cluster displayed distinct patterns of functional connectivity with specific substructures within medial temporal, parietal, frontal and occipital cortices as well as subcortical and cerebellar regions. Our findings demonstrate that TW-dFC provides a powerful framework for anatomically informed functional parcellation of the hippocampus and offers new insights into the structural-functional organisation underlying hippocampal-(sub)cortical interactions. Our approach opens new avenues for probing memory systems in health and their disruption in aging and disease.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a female-selective corticosterone-mediated microglia-neuron interaction in vivo during ketamine anesthesia recovery, absent in males. This microglia-neuron interaction induces plastic and functional neuronal changes, as evidenced by increased spine density and mEPSC frequency, which is occluded upon microglia depletion. We show that this process is driven through upregulation of the stress-responsive co-chaperone Fkbp5 mRNA and its protein, FKBP51, in female microglia. Fkbp5/FKBP51 is a key intermediary in a corticosteroid-induced stress response, and its involvement points towards a critical interface between endocrine signaling and microglia. Thus, to counteract the observed KXA-mediated corticosterone increase in the blood, we remove the primary source of corticosterone through adrenalectomy. Close microglia-neuron interaction was absent, but was reinstated after corticosterone injection. Our findings offer a new mechanism of microglia-mediated neuronal plasticity during anesthesia recovery, which is mediated through corticosterone, enhancing our understanding of sex differences in brain function.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

M.; Appaqaq, S.; Guo, J.-Z.; Hantman, A. W.", "abstract": "The mammalian brain is fundamentally interconnected. Across species, a single neuron typically forms thousands of synapses spanning local and long-range connections. This architecture suggests that brain function is distributed, but it remains poorly understood how relevant networks are selectively engaged to produce appropriate behaviors. To address this, we recorded >40,000 neurons, simultaneously monitoring five cerebellar and cerebral brain areas as mice performed complex motor actions, capturing interactions of >5,000,000 cross-area neuron pairs. This revealed that complex pre-movement cross-area interactions coordinate distributed networks to produce precise and consistent actions. Prior to action production, action-informative neural populations across the brain become coupled, while non-informative populations decouple. This coupling and decoupling was mirrored by two distinct local field potential oscillations linking neuron-level to population-level dynamics. External modulation of these dynamics revealed their necessity for skilled action. Our work highlights that a complex pre-movement orchestration of coupling and decoupling ensures the selective engagement of relevant distributed networks to produce precise action.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Analysis of the DNA replication machinery of Asgard archaea may provide a valuable test of the hypothesis of this phylum being the origin of Eukarya. Among the replication proteins, primase, which comprises the catalytic subunit PriS and the noncatalytic subunit PriL, synthesizes primers for extension by DNA polymerase. Here we show that Asgard primases fall into two major groups, denoted the Heimdall group and the Loki group, which are phylogenetically and structurally more closely related to eukaryotic primases and primases from non-Asgard archaea, respectively. Notably, like human PriL, PriL of the Heimdall group possesses an extra C-terminal domain, which, absent in archaeal PriL of the non-Heimdall group, presumably serves to enhance the stability of the conserved iron-sulfur cluster in PriL. We overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified the PriS and PriL subunits of the Heimdall group from the Candidatus Gerdarchaeota archaeon B18_G1. Biochemical characterization reveals that the B18_G1 primase is capable of primer synthesis and extension, using preferentially dNTPs as the substrates, as shown for primases from non-Asgard archaea, but, unlike the non-Asgard archaeal primases, it produces short primers, a feature typical of eukaryotic primases. These results shed significant light on the evolutionary pathway of primase, and are consistent with the hypothesis of the Asgard origin of Eukarya.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

P.; Kaschner, K.; Kesner-Reyes, K.; Bailly, N.; Cheung, W. W. L.", "abstract": "Marine biodiversity underpins ecosystem health and is critical for the provision of essential ecological services. Global efforts to mitigate biodiversity loss are underway but require comprehensive knowledge on the biogeography of species to be effective. However, key challenges limit comprehensive mapping of species distributions, including the complexity of ocean ecosystems and the difficulty of sampling the marine realm. Global initiatives such as AquaMaps pioneered large-scale marine species mapping using species distribution models or Ecological Niche models and provided the knowledge base for effective marine conservation and management. Recently, methodological and data advances have enabled a more modern and robust approach that enables higher resolution outputs more suited to conservation applications at all scales. Building on AquaMaps, we develop a next-generation marine species habitat suitability modelling platform called AquaX, providing a suite of advances that include an ensemble of ten machine learning algorithms, enabling spatial uncertainty assessments, validation indices, and ecological niche representation at a ten-fold improved spatial resolution of 0.05{degrees}. Furthermore, AquaX integrates (i) accepted taxonomy from the World Register of Marine Species, (ii) species-specific ecological, physiological, and biogeographical information (D3-Ocean system), (iii) updated occurrence records validated through expert input, and (iv) refined species range maps using expert knowledge and biogeographical divisions. AquaX also projects species habitat suitability for both present and future conditions based on two time periods and three climate scenarios. This work provides species range maps for numerous species compared to previously available datasets and improves the accurate use of observational data. The approaches described here improve predictive accuracy at scales more relevant to marine biodiversity conservation and offer an openly accessible tool to support marine biodiversity research and conservation planning under accelerating environmental change. AquaX represents an important step forward in species distribution modeling, enabling researchers and policymakers to better understand marine biodiversity patterns and develop more effective conservation strategies.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

In Kenya, gonococcal molecular surveillance remains limited, leaving gaps in understanding circulating sequence types (STs). This study characterized Kenyan N. gonorrhoeae isolates using multiple molecular typing schemes. Methods Illumina MiSeq generated paired-end sequence reads prepared from 35 N. gonorrhoeae isolates recovered from males and females from four different regions in Kenya were analyzed. Assemblies were analyzed using PubMLST tools for multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and the N. gonorrhoeae sequence typing for antimicrobial resistance (NG-STAR) scheme. Multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) was carried out using the NG-MAST database. Phylogenetic relationships were assessed using concatenated NG-STAR loci and core genome-based analyses. Results Twenty-two MLST STs were identified, including eight novel STs; ST-1932 was most frequent. NG-MAST revealed 29 STs, of which 26 were novel, with a newly described ST-19168 predominating in Nyanza region. NG-STAR identified 23 STs with variation across mtrR, penA, 23S rRNA, gyrA, parC, ponA, and porB. Phylogenetic analyses showed clustering of isolates into distinct groups with diverse AMR profiles. One cluster comprised isolates resistant to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. No clear association was observed between MLST, NG-MAST, or NG-STAR types and specific AMR patterns. Conclusion Kenyan N. gonorrhoeae strains are genetically diverse, with high numbers of novel NG-MAST and MLST STs. The lack of regional clustering and varied AMR profiles suggest widespread transmission of heterogeneous gonococcal populations.

Despite the earlier data indicating that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection induces aberrant DNA methylation in the gastric mucosa, the CDO1 methylation level has not been studied in H. pylori-positive (HPP) chronic gastritis patients. This study aimed to investigate the CDO1 methylation level in patients with chronic gastritis who have and do not have H. pylori infection, in comparison to gastric tumours. The quantitative analysis of the promoter methylation of the CDO1 gene and CDO1 immunopositivity was determined in 45 primary gastric tumors, 17 biopsy samples of HPP-chronic gastritis, 23 H. pylori-negative (HPN) chronic gastritis, and 15 normal mucosa as the control. CDO1 expression levels were measured by immunohistochemical staining, and the methylation level of the promoter region was determined by quantitative methylation-specific PCR after bisulfite conversion. CDO1 gene promoter methylation levels were significantly higher in the gastric cancer (GC) group compared to the HPN-chronic gastritis and control groups (P = 0.000). There was no significant difference between the GC group and the HPP-chronic gastritis group. The CDO1 gene promoter methylation levels were higher in the HPP-chronic gastritis group than in the HPN-chronic gastritis group (P = 0.049). There was no significant difference between the study groups for the CDO1 immunopositivity score. The CDO1 gene promoter methylation levels are increased in GC and HPP-chronic gastritis patients. The CDO1 methylation, regardless of differences in protein expression, may be a promising non-invasive marker for early diagnosis of GC in HPP-chronic gastritis patients.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

As of now, approaches often are temporary through medication, permanently using invasive implants with surgical complications or neuromodulation therapy. However, non-invasive, state-dependent neuromodulation during sleep is technically challenging, especially with the lack of flexibility, comfortability and robustness for sleep conditions. Here, we introduce a Non-invasive Electrophysiological Recording and Ultrasound Neuromodulation Sleep Patch (NEUSLeeP) in delivering focused ultrasound stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) overnight with simultaneous stable polysomnography recording. Our sleep patch integrates a custom eight-channel concentric ring transducer array with real-time electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG) recording, and individualized line-of-sight targeting to sonicate deep brain areas while preserving mobility. Our platform operated safely and comfortably across the two-nights sleep study. Stimulation of the left STN was delivered every 90 minutes throughout the night and was associated with a 25% increase in REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep duration and a 43 minutes reduction in REM sleep latency compared to a sham night in a study of 26 subjects. Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal attenuation in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was localized primarily to a left ipsilateral basal-ganglia-midbrain-temporal circuit, consistent with selective network modulation rather than global arousal changes. Overall, NEUSLeeP demonstrates feasibility by (i) a light weight and wearable ultrasound neuromodulation and sleep recording during natural sleep; (ii) establishing a potential mechanism relating targeted ultrasound stimulation of STN/sleep networks to REM enhancement.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Understanding how the manipulation of the source-sink ratio (S-S ratio) affects yield and grain traits is critical for elucidating the physiological mechanisms behind yield stability in high-yield environments. This study aimed to evaluate how variations in the S-S ratio during the grain-filling phase influence grain weight and yield, biomass allocation, grain-filling dynamics, and grain quality traits in rapeseed. A field experiment was conducted during two seasons in Valdivia, Chile. One high-yield potential and adapted hybrid (Click CL) was evaluated under three radiation regimes in a randomized complete block design: control, -50 % incident radiation (shading), and +50 % incident radiation (reflected radiation pannels, PET). S-S ratio treatments were applied from the beginning of grain filling (BBCH 71) to physiological maturity (BBCH 89) aimed at modify the S-S ratio during the actual grain filling period. The reduced S-S ratio increased thousand-grain weight (TGW), particularly in basal siliques, resulting in yield compensation and demonstrating a strong structural and physiological buffering capacity. Conversely, increasing the S-S ratio enhanced grain number and grain yield, while TGW remained stable. Grain quality traits responded asymmetrically: under reduced S-S, oil concentration slightly declined whereas protein concentration increased. The increased S-S ratio, had no effect on grain oil and protein concentrations, remaining similar to the control. Sieving analyses revealed a shift toward larger grain size classes under reduced S-S, whereas the distribution under increased S-S resembled the control. Overall, these findings indicate that rapeseed maintains yield stability through compensatory adjustments in grain weight and size distribution under contrasting assimilate availabilities. Under high-radiation temperate conditions, rapeseed productivity during grain filling is predominantly governed by sink capacity, highlighting its physiological plasticity and resilience to variations in source-sink balance", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

To help understand this system, researchers need humanized experimental and computational models that can interrogate how endometrial cell populations impact each other in both physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model changes in the rates of endometrial cell proliferation and death in response to hormones, cytokines, and the specific cell types present. To calibrate this computational model, we used previously-published experimental datasets from a 3D co-culture platform supporting primary human endometrial epithelial organoids and endometrial stromal cells. Our ODE-based model can simulate the size of endometrial epithelial organoids and the density of stromal cells over time under multiple hormone/cytokine conditions in mono- and co-cultures. We further created a second, partial differential equation (PDE)-based model that simulates the diffusion of molecules added to these 3D cultures and their uptake by proliferating endometrial cells using the predicted cell densities from the ODE model as inputs to the PDE simulations. We show that the exposure to hormones and cytokines used in the experiments is reasonably homogenous throughout the 3D culture and identify conditions where this would not be true. Altogether we use these models to quantify the influence of stromal cells on epithelial cell proliferation and vice versa, to identify differences across cells from different donors, and to provide a quantitative assessment of experimental designs.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Understanding this neuroanatomical architecture in vitro is fundamental to elucidating the cellular computations underlying functional network formation. Neuronal connectivity orchestrated through axonal pathfinding, is an interplay of biochemical signals and electromechanical properties of the growth substrate. This study focusses on how neuronal morphology and networking are affected by the periodic, micrometer-scale patterned stripes of two electrically contrasting polymers - poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) - poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). This periodic confinement provides a length-scale driven cue which unfolds as a self-organized, frequency-modulated spatial phenomenon. Primary cortical cultures on these patterned substrates reveal significant differences with more elaborate network formation on PVDF-TrFE stripe. The features observed at the stripe boundaries, along with the dependence on stripe width, suggest that the neurons exhibit a preference to remain confined within the PVDF-TrFE region, with growth cones deflecting away from the PEDOT:PSS regions. These observations show a promising route for development of a functional template capable of directing axonal growth, synapse formation and neural rewiring in early models of connectivity disorders in vivo.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a biophysically-based meanfield model that integrates cellular and network-level details to simulate the effects of these compounds at different spatial scales. By incorporating the brain-wide distribution of 5-HT2A receptors, our model mechanistically links receptor activation to a reduction in leak membrane potassium conductance, consistent with electrophysiological data. Our simulations reveal that this microscopic perturbation leads to the emergence of a brain state characterized by asynchronous and irregular dynamics with increased firing rates, as well as significant alterations in spectral power. Specifically, we find a robust decrease in power within the delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands, a result consistent with empirical findings. This change in dynamics is accompanied by an increase in spontaneous complexity, as quantified by the Lempel-Ziv complexity index, as observed experimentally. Furthermore, our model accurately replicates experimental findings regarding the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI), demonstrating that PCI does not increase significantly by psychedelic drug administration. This crucial dissociation, where spontaneous complexity and spectral power are increased while perturbational complexity is preserved, highlights the distinct neurophysiological substrates underlying different metrics in psychedelic states.

Prior expression profiling studies of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice and rhesus macaques within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have shown variation in myelin gene expression may be linked with alcohol sensitivity and consumption. Methods: Combining gene expression studies from human and mouse PFC, we identified a cross-species gene network enriched for myelin-associated genes. Since myelin expression is correlated to alcohol sensitivity and alcohol drinking behavior, we hypothesized basal levels of PFC myelin gene expression may be a genomic determinant for these behavioral responses. Using an animal model of CNS demyelination, and localized knock down of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1), we measured effects of cortical myelin reduction on initial alcohol sensitivity and drinking behavior. Results: Reducing myelin-related gene expression significantly altered sensitivity to alcohol and decreased alcohol consumption. Mouse genetic-based studies identified Ndrg1 as a putative quantitative trait gene for sedative-hypnotic responses to alcohol. Site-specific injections of shNdrg1 lentivirus into PFC led to a significant decrease in NDRG1 expression, causing increased alcohol behavioral sensitivity and reduced preference for high concentrations of alcohol. Conclusion: Myelin is an important biological component underlying CNS disorders. Our studies demonstrate the role of a novel candidate gene (Ndrg1), and myelin-associated gene expression, as an important factor modulating initial sensitivity to alcohol and alcohol consumption. Differences in the expression of myelin-related genes, including Ndrg1, may serve as future therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorders.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Brain changes begin years before clinical symptoms emerge, making neuroimaging a strong candidate for onset prediction. However, FTD is highly heterogeneous, encompassing diverse molecular pathologies, affected brain networks, and symptom trajectories. This variability limits the predictive power of any single imaging biomarker and underscores the need for an integrative, multimodal approach to improve prediction accuracy and generalizability. We used machine learning to integrate diverse neuroimaging features, identifying a robust signature for risk stratification. We analyzed T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI scans from 71 symptomatic C9orf72 carriers, 90 presymptomatic carriers, and 69 healthy controls from the GENFI cohort. We used FreeSurfer to measure cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, and BISON to quantify white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We applied Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction and trained a random forest classifier to distinguish symptomatic carriers from controls. The model was subsequently applied to the presymptomatic cohort to identify individuals whose brain patterns resembled those of symptomatic cases, under the hypothesis that greater similarity indicated a higher risk of conversion. We validated the model with neuropsychological data and a two-year longitudinal follow-up. The classifier distinguished symptomatic C9orf72 carriers from controls with 87.0% accuracy. When applied to presymptomatic carriers, the model identified 21.1% of the cohort as having brain features comparable to those of symptomatic cases. This <span>\"high-risk group\"</span> showed significant neuropsychological weaknesses in executive function, language and social cognition compared to the non high-risk group. The model accurately predicted clinical conversion within a two-year period with 84.5% accuracy, a 70% sensitivity and a 93.3% negative predictive value. Our findings demonstrate the utility of a machine learning approach using multi-modal MRI to identify presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers at high risk of disease onset within the next two years. By capturing subtle neuroanatomical patterns associated with disease processes, this approach offers a promising method for stratifying genetic FTD carriers prior to symptom onset.

Using the Drosophila connectome and circuit modeling, we uncover a layered control architecture in the lateral accessory lobes (LAL) that arbitrates between goal pursuit and stimulus-driving overrides. First, a dorsal pathway that forms a dominant indirect ''pro-goal'' push-pull circuit that amplifies left-right asymmetries. Second, a faster ventral pathway forms an ''anti-goal'' circuit that recruits and inverts the pro-goal circuit to redirect movement, and only engages when a goal is present. The architecture also resolves two symmetry challenges: Rear Stalemate (goal 180 behind) and Front Stalemate (threat dead ahead), by rapidly amplifying tiny perturbations into decisive turns.

CD5 and TCF7 expression defined novel B-cell types. CD27+ mature B-cells occupied novel nodal spaces non-overlapping with the cortex and the plasma-cell rich medullary cords. Type 2 conventional dendritic cells were located in nodular paracortical aggregates. Statistically controlled pairwise neighborhood analysis showed sparse cell-cell interactions, known and new neighbors, established and novel LN landscape niches.

Aggregated community diversity metrics changed with depth, but were not statistically significant temporally at a fixed location. However, finer-scale population-level analyses revealed both depth and temporal change, including physicochemical depth-driven differences and, in surface waters, thousands of viral populations that exhibited statistically significant diel rhythms. Statistical analyses revealed three main archetypes of temporal dynamics that themselves differed in abundance patterns, host predictions, viral taxonomy, and gene functions. Among these, highlights include viruses resembling an archetype with a night peaking pattern in activity that include an over-representation of viruses that putatively infect Prochlorococcus, a phototrophic cyanobacteria.

Some phenotypes adapted to or induced by hatchery environments are thought to be maladapted for life in the wild. Thus, enriching the hatchery environment (abiotically and biotically) to make it more similar to the wild may induce phenotypes, including gene expression profiles, that are better suited to the environments fish will experience after release. Here, we took a molecular approach (TagSeq) to elucidate how abiotic and biotic (predator training) enrichment impacts the whole-brain gene expression of a species of conservation concern, the Arkansas darter (Etheostoma cragini), comparing the effects in two hatchery populations to a wild reference population. While we found no effect of biotic enrichment, we found that numerous genes were differentially expressed between populations and abiotic enrichment treatments. Notably, we found that expression profiles of hatchery fish more closely resembled those of wild fish when reared with abiotic enrichment. Functional analysis revealed that many differentially expressed genes were related to feeding behavior, development, and reproduction. These results have implications for conservation, supporting the management of darters at the level of the population and the use of abiotic enrichment to reduce phenotypic mismatch between hatchery and wild fish.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

S.; Libby, E.", "abstract": "Endosymbiotic relationships have fueled the evolution of complex life. The persistence of these relationships relies on coordinating the reproduction of hosts and their guests. Yet, such coordination may come at a cost, as one or both partners may need to slow their growth to synchronize. Here, we examine the fitness consequences of synchronization by using a combination of mathematical and bacterial metabolic models. Analyzing millions of putative host-guest pairings, we find that synchronization is typically costly for hosts but beneficial for guests. We show that synchronization can occur when hosts relinquish metabolic resources to guests. Given the costs to hosts, we investigate whether hosts can benefit from growing faster, at the risk of losing their endosymbionts. Our mathematical model suggests this outcome is theoretically possible, but metabolic modeling consistently indicates that synchronization increases overall fitness - provided the formation of new endosymbioses is rare. When new relationships can readily form, the optimal strategy shifts: hosts maximize fitness by growing as fast as possible, leading to regular cycles of loss and reacquisition of their guests. Overall, our findings indicate that while synchronization is costly for hosts, it offers long-term fitness benefits in contexts where endosymbionts are not easily replaced.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

RNA sequencing revealed that nine biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of the phytopathogenic Verticillium dahliae react to different nutrient environments. The adapt-to-nutrient NRPS-like (ANN) cluster contributes to antibacterial activity and developmental processes important for the early biotrophic life cycle, but is dispensable for virulence on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Transcription of the core biosynthetic enzyme-encoding ANN3 is highly induced in nutrient-poor environment. ANN3 is transcriptionally controlled by global and in-cluster transcription factors. ANN3 is activated by early colonisation transcription factors Som1 and Vta2, but repressed by Mtf1, which governs late stages of disease progression. The in-cluster transcription factor Ann1, which represses ANN3, is less stable in nutrient-poor environment or when V. dahliae encounters antagonists. Ann1 promotes resting structure formation but suppresses conidiation and antibacterial activity. Possible products of the ANN cluster were revealed by comparing metabolites extracted from ANN3 regulator mutants and from the bacterial-fungal interaction zone. Our findings revealed that V. dahliae perceives different nutrient environments and changes its survival strategy by differential expression of the ANN secondary metabolite gene cluster.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

To investigate the putative genetic basis of this disease, we generated high-quality whole-genome data from 249 individuals spanning the species' range, including from the New Zealand mainland (Northern range) and subantarctic Enderby and Campbell Islands (Southern). Population genomic analyses unexpectedly revealed three deeply divergent lineages with negligible gene flow, consistent with recognition of three distinct subspecies. Phylogenetic divergence dating suggests that these splits predate human arrival by several millennia, with the Northern lineage diverging from the Southern populations 5-16 ka. Genome scans for local adaptation revealed regions of strong differentiation, and genome-wide association analyses identified candidate immune and respiratory genes linked to RDS. In partnership with Ngai Tahu, who hold indigenous guardianship over yellow-eyed penguins, we recommend recognition of three subspecies, urgent conservation action for the critically small and rapidly declining Northern subspecies, and the need for immediate population size and trend assessments for Auckland and Campbell Island populations.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

While certain PP-InsP isomers have been conclusively linked to the regulation of phosphate homeostasis through interaction with SPX domain containing proteins in plants, the functions of the recently discovered isomer 4/6-PP-InsP5 remain largely unknown. Here, we employed two complementary affinity-based strategies - a matrix approach and a photoaffinity probe - to systematically identify 4/6-PP-InsP5-binding proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. The two methods yielded partially overlapping protein sets, with photoaffinity enrichment likely capturing additional transient and/or weak interactions. Moreover, competition experiments with different isomers were applied to obtain information about potential isomer-specific interactions. As a proof-of-concept, one candidate interactor (FHA domain-containing protein AtFHA2) was shown to bind 4-PP-InsP5 in vitro with substantially higher affinity than InsP6. Thus, besides the SPX domain, FHA domain containing proteins, of which 18 exist in Arabidopsis, are potentially regulated by inositol pyrophosphates.

When biological surveys with DNA (meta)barcoding target underexplored biological communities, sequence-based identification is often conducted using incomplete databases that do not fully cover the regional species pool. Consequently, specimens to be identified may include species not present in reference databases. Such unknown or \"out-of-distribution\" samples can cause misidentification if left undetected. A similarity cutoff is commonly used to detect out-of-distribution samples before taxonomic assignment, but its effectiveness has not been carefully studied. In this study, we evaluated the performance of out-of-distribution detection for DNA barcoding with genetic distance and deep learning metrics. Using extensively sampled datasets of multiple insect taxa, we measured the performance of identification and out-of-distribution detection under conditions in which genetic variations in species were sufficiently sampled. Although identification with DNA barcoding is a highly accurate process, even with short noisy fragments, out-of-distribution detection was more susceptible to a reduction in performance due to sequence noise and a lack of diagnosable characters.

Research on CSA has been challenging due to its size, chemical heterogeneity, and multitude of binding partners. To address these issues, we developed a model of CSA for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations based on the Martini 3 force-field. We demonstrate that this model is capable of reproducing atomistic properties of the repeating CSA disaccharide unit, including its molecular volume and bonded interactions, and structural polymer properties of CSA chains of different lengths. In particular, for biologically-relevant long chains and despite of using an explicit solvent, the computational cost is significantly reduced, relative to the cost equivalent atomistic simulations would require. The compatibility of the model with the Martini G[o] protein model was tested by retrieving the force-response of the CSA-malaria adhesin VAR2CSA complex. Importantly, we explored the influence of electrostatics on CSA aggregation. We show that the default Martini 3 parameters lead to over-aggregation. We provide at least three different strategies to alleviate this issue, making use of a bigger bead for sodium cations, reflecting its hydration shell, partial ionic charges, as a mean-field resource to take into account electronic polarizability, and, optionally, particle-mesh Ewald summation as a more robust treatment of long-range electrostatics.

Hygienic behavior and individual immunity enable bees to cope with some pests and parasites. Hygienic response of adult bees is driven by olfactory cues emanating from diseased brood. In this study, we tested the effect of viral inoculation on the chemical profile and immune response of pupae, independently of Varroa. We injected pupae with various doses of an enriched inocula of either a deformed wing virus (DWV) B-A recombinant or Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and followed their development and survival for five days. At the end of the five-day period, volatile profiles, viral loads, and expression of seven immune genes were assessed. Both IAPV and the DWV loads increased to equivalent high levels irrespective of the initial dose applied. Notably, greater rates of mortality (60% loss) were observed with the highest IAPV dose when compared to the lowest IAPV dose (15% loss). The DWV inoculum caused limited mortality but nonetheless inhibited pupae development. The IAPV injected pupae showed evidence of a dose-dependent DWV amplification from either a DWV variant in the original IAPV inoculum or from an endogenous source of DWV in the pupae themselves. IAPV-injected pupae had lower expression of immune genes than DWV-injected pupae, suggesting IAPV inhibits the pupae's immune response. Overall, among the seven tested immune genes, six were upregulated with only vago downregulated, suggesting inhibition of the RNAi pathway following infection. Chemical cues of mock and untreated pupae were similar, but notably different from the virus-injected pupae for both inocula. Our findings show that Varroa-independent virus-inoculated pupae produce unique virus-specific chemical cues; the ultimate consequence of such a change might lead to virus-specific bee behavioral responses.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

How moderate increases in temperature affect this plant immune signalling remains unclear. We explored this by using flg22 and the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) FLS2 as a model receptor-ligand system and Ca2+ signaling as a representative PTI output. A pre-treatment at 28{degrees}C significantly impaired the flg22-induced [Ca2+]cyt influx, leading to a reduced expression of calcium-dependent defence genes, ICS1 and EDS1. This effect correlated with a temperature-dependent reduction in FLS2 abundance. A qualitatively similar inhibition of these responses was observed when membrane fluidity was artificially increased using benzyl alcohol. This suggests that the effect of elevated temperature might act through changes in membrane properties. Artificially restoring FLS2 protein levels rescued flg22-dependent Ca2+ signalling and ICS1 and EDS1 expression in seedlings pre-treated at 28{degrees}C or with benzyl alcohol. Together, these findings indicate that increased membrane fluidity reduces FLS2 protein levels, thereby compromising Ca2+ signalling, and probably other, induced responses. This highlights a potential mechanistic link between temperature perception, membrane fluidity, and FLS2-dependent calcium signalling, providing insight into how an increase in global temperatures may compromise plant immune responses in the future.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

MIQ-RS showed a bifactorial structure (visual and kinesthetic modalities) according to confirmatory factor analysis, and its reliability (internal consistency) was good. In the iFST, internal validity analyses via generalized mixed models showed a clear effect of sequence complexity, stronger for execution than imagery. Reliability, estimated via signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) using hierarchical Bayesian models, was also adequate (SNR > 1.6). In the HLJT, expected effects of rotation angle, hand view, and their interaction, consistent with biomechanical constraints, were also found. Reliability was also adequate (SNR > 1.75).

However, the specific impact of right frontoparietal dysfunction on the functional (re)organization of the left hemisphere remains poorly understood. In this study, we introduce a novel application of functional connectivity gradient analysis to investigate macroscale functional reorganization in the non-lesioned left hemisphere of patients with chronic left spatial neglect. Focusing on resting-state fMRI data, we demonstrate that abnormal segregation patterns in the left frontoparietal and default mode networks are robustly associated with neglect severity and spatial attentional bias. Notably, the principal gradienttypically capturing a global unimodal-to-transmodal hierarchy--was altered in these patients, suggesting a reorganization favoring lateralized unimodal networks. We also show that the structural integrity of the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) plays a key role in shaping these functional dynamics.

To thrive across different salinities, picocyanobacteria strains acclimate internal turgor by expending metabolic energy to accumulate compatible solutes and extrude inorganic ions. We grew five picocyanobacterial strains, derived from a range of source habitat salinities, under a matrix of light and salinity levels. Although Chl is a general proxy for phytoplankton biomass, Chl/cell is itself a key component of acclimation. Indeed, for all strains, except the brackish water CZS48M, the conditions supporting the highest Biovolume-specific growth rates shifted upwards towards higher salinities and PAR, compared to conditions for maximum Chl-specific growth. Therefore, the apparent optimal niche for a strain varies depending upon the metric used to track growth. Strains CZS48M and CZS25K derived from brackish lagoons of the Baltic Sea may be true 'brackobionts', with maximal growth at brackish salinities and high PAR, coinciding with their maximal metabolic capacities. CZS48M and CZS25K both also show high metabolism under higher salinity and low PAR, suggesting a situation of rapid metabolism, but lower achieved growth, under stress at the edges of their environmental tolerance ranges. Conversely, NIES981 (full marine, East China Sea) shows rapid metabolism under high, but also under low, salinities. The preferred salinity of each strain is consistent with its genome-encoded capabilities to synthesize different compatible solutes. In general, across strains, maximal metabolic rate is often offset from growth rate optima, showing conversion of metabolic electrons to biomass varies widely depending upon strain and condition, likely partly reflecting the costs of turgor regulation at the limits of salinity tolerance.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

One recent method to determine single-cell activity of prokaryotes is bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), which offers a non-radioactive approach to measure protein synthesis. However, direct comparisons between BONCAT and radioisotope-based techniques across ocean depth gradients remain limited, particularly for low-activity prokaryotic communities. To address this knowledge gap, we tested an optimised BONCAT protocol using picolyl azide fluorophores (BONCAT-pic) to assess single-cell heterotrophic activity in prokaryotic communities from surface to bathypelagic depths (1000-4000 m) in the Southern Ocean near the Kerguelen Islands. The method was first optimised using aged coastal and open-ocean seawater, and then compared to microautoradiography with 3H-methionine uptake. Statistical analysis shows that BONCAT-pic significantly improved detection sensitivity compared to standard azide reagents.

As an essential nutrient and second messenger, calcium (Ca2+) is widely implicated in diverse plant physiological activities; however, its role in the ethylene signal transduction pathway remains elusive. Here, we identified a calcium-dependent antagonism of ethylene response (CAER) specifically modulates root elongation in the model cereal rice (Oryza sativa). Interestingly, we demonstrate that the ethylene receptors OsERS1 and OsERS2 both function as Ca2+-permeable channels, with OsERS1 further acting as a non-selective cation channel capable of permeating both monovalent and divalent cations. Mutagenesis analysis reveals that OsERS1 channel activity relies on homomeric assembly sites (C4/C6) rather than its ethylene-binding site (C65), indicating a clear decoupling of the molecular modules governing receptor signaling and ion channel function. The loss-of-function mutant Osers1/2 does not exhibit the CAER phenotype of the wild type (WT), confirm that this calcium-dependent regulatory mechanism is dependent on both OsERS1 and OsERS2.

Here, we resolve this paradox by explicitly modelling the resource dynamics that control species diversity, which May neglects. Although increasing resource diversity can increase species diversity (the competitive exclusion principle) and thus should destabilise communities according to May, we find the opposite: resource diversity consistently generates stable, species-rich communities. Furthermore, we show that contrary to the prevailing belief that interaction heterogeneity is always destabilising, different biological sources of interaction variance have opposing effects on stability. Our analytically derived stability condition showed that, consistent with previous work, stability is always induced when the correlation between growth and consumption exceeds the square root of species packing ratio (the number of surviving species/the number of surviving resources). Our work overturns a longstanding view in theoretical ecology, and demonstrates that resource dynamics are not just negligible background but are central drivers of ecosystem stability.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, such analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between a proteins sequence, structural conformation, and functional output. Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) is an alchemical, all-atom molecular dynamics based computational approach that determines the free energy change ( from wild type to mutant states. Two widely adopted software platforms used for this purpose are Schrodinger and GROMACS. We have compared the results of FEP simulations for mutations using these platforms, employing the OPLS4 force field implemented in Schrodinger, and the Amber99SB-ILDN force field implemented in GROMACS for this work. For the 38 single mutants of S. nuclease, the Pearson r between the experimental and the calculated free energy change was 0.86 using Schrodinger and 0.87 using GROMACS. The reliability of the FEP method using the two software platforms with the specified force fields was further demonstrated by its performance on 24 single mutants of T4 lysozyme, yielding strong correlation between predicted and experimental values, with Pearson r of 0.80 for Schrodinger and 0.85 for GROMACS. Additionally, the computed folding free energy changes for 45 double mutations in S. nuclease using Schrodinger correlated well with both experimental measurements (Pearson r = 0.74) and previously reported GROMACS values (Pearson r = 0.71). Correspondingly, the nonadditivities of the double mutations derived using Schrodinger for these 45 double mutants of S. nuclease were also found to be in good agreement with the experimental values (Pearson r = 0.79), as well as with the previously reported GROMACS results (Pearson r = 0.61). A good correlation was also observed between computed values from Schrodinger and GROMACS, with a Pearson r of 0.71 for double mutants and 0.61 for their nonadditivities. Collectively, these findings establish the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of Schrodinger FEP+ and GROMACS in predicting mutation induced free energy changes in S. nuclease and T4 lysozyme.

FCD type II is defined by abnormal lamination, altered cellular composition, and pathological cells, notably dysmorphic neurons (DNs) and balloon cells. DNs are thought to drive epileptogenicity through both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, the latter including not only aberrant connectivity but also indirect modulation of excitability in local cell populations. We performed a multiscale structural and morphological analysis to elucidate the basis of FCD epileptogenicity and the impact of somatic mTOR mutations during brain development. Using a mouse model of FCD type II, we show that lesions in frontal and motor cortical regions are the strongest predictors of spontaneous seizure occurrence. This localization-dependent epileptogenicity offers an experimental explanation for the higher clinical epileptogenicity of frontal FCDs and suggests that posterior lesions may remain silent - an open question in human pathology. In our model, FCD tissue displayed considerable expansion, with cortical thickness up to ~20% in seizure-bearing animals. This expansion coincided with an overall ~40% reduction in neuronal density, consistent with tissue hypertrophy. DN density did not differ between seizure and non-seizure animals, challenging the notion that higher DN load directly predicts epileptogenesis. At the microscopic level, we describe DN axonal pathologies, including giant varicosities. In the cortex, these appeared as vesicle-filled boutons, whereas along callosal axons they were frequent but largely empty. Bouton density was markedly reduced in FCD cortex. Together, these findings leave the net synaptic effect of dysmorphic neurons unresolved, challenging the assumption that axonal hypertrophy translates into increased excitatory drive. While morphological abnormalities in FCD type II are well documented, their functional consequences remain incompletely understood. Here, we used macro- and microscopic structural features of FCDII to assess seizure susceptibility, providing new insights into epileptogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Previous neuroimaging work suggests that such contextual associations shape the neural representation of isolated objects even in the absence of the scene context. Yet, three key questions remain unanswered: (1) How do representations of contextual associations relate to perceptual and categorical representation in visual cortex, (2) how do they emerge across time, and (3) how are they mechanistically implemented? To answer these questions, we recorded fMRI and EEG while participants (human, both sexes) viewed isolated objects stemming from two scene contexts. Multivariate pattern analysis on the neural data revealed that objects from the same context were coded more similarly than objects from different contexts in object-selective LOC and scene-selective PPA, even when systematically controlling for perceptual and categorical similarities. Such contextual relation representations emerged relatively late during visual processing (i.e., after perceptual and categorical representations), specifically in the anterior PPA, and likely through a mixture of object-to-object and object-to-scene associations. Together, our results demonstrate that contextual relation representations emerged for isolated objects, and without a task that encourages their formation, suggesting that objects automatically activate context frames that support visual cognition in real-world environments.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

B.; Urgen, B. A.", "abstract": "Perceiving the direction of observed actions is critical for interpreting intentions and guiding social interaction. While direction selectivity has been extensively studied with simple stimuli such as dots, gratings, or point-light displays (PLDs), little is known about how the brain encodes direction in naturalistic, repetitive actions that are seen frequently in daily life. The present fMRI study investigated direction-selective representations during observation of complex actions performed along three bidirectional dimensions (left-right, up-down, front-back) within a 96-video stimulus set. The brain activity was analyzed using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and multiple regression representational similarity analysis (RSA). MVPA revealed above-chance classification of action direction across occipital, parietal, and motor cortices, with the highest decoding in occipital, primary motor, and somatosensory regions. Crucially, RSA demonstrated that when accounting for low-level and motor features, direction information was still represented in early visual cortex, occipito-temporal areas, parietal regions, and motor-related regions. These findings indicate that action direction is represented across multiple levels of the action observation network (AON), extending from early sensory regions to higher-order parietal and frontal cortices. By using naturalistic, repetitive action videos, this study provides new evidence that the coding of action direction in the human brain is broadly distributed, reflecting the complexity of perceiving actions in everyday life. These findings suggest that direction selectivity is a core feature of the action observation network, linking basic motion processing with higher-level action understanding.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

The AAA+ ATPase TRIP13 is a master meiotic regulator involved in numerous cellular processes, including DSB repair, organization of the meiotic chromosome axis, and meiotic silencing of unsynapsed axes. Here, we examine the involvement of TRIP13 in transcription suppression and DSB repair during meiotic prophase I in mice. Because TRIP13 is required for silencing of sex chromosomes at pachynema, we hypothesized that it may also be involved in the global transcription suppression that begins at the onset of meiotic prophase. Indeed, as predicted, we observed increased incorporation of 5-ethynyl uridine in early stages of meiotic prophase I and a higher presence of the active form of RNA polymerase II in Trip13 mutant spermatocytes. RNA sequencing data revealed that more than two-thirds of upregulated transcripts came from the sex chromosomes. Given this more general role in transcription silencing, we also tested whether TRIP13 promotes the transcription block that causes meiotic arrest in synapsis-deficient oocytes. However, Trip13 ablation did not rescue Spo11-/- oocytes, which experience asynapsis without DSB repair defects. Instead, Trip13 mutation did increase the number of oocytes in Dmc1-/- Chk2-/- mice, in which DSBs persist unrepaired. This rescue seems attributable to a previously unknown function of TRIP13 in preventing DSB repair by non-canonical pathways, as we observed fewer homologous recombination markers along with an increased presence of non-homologous end joining markers in the triple mutant cells. These findings underscore TRIP13's multifaceted role in transcription and DSB repair regulation during meiosis, highlighting its importance and potential for further meiotic regulation and fertility research.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

This is especially problematic for the rapid developments of floating offshore wind farms (OWFs), and decommissioning of oil and gas (O&G) platforms in deep (>100 m) habitats of Norway, the U.K. and Ireland. In this study, we analysed the stable isotopic composition of muscle and liver and the condition of three codfishes of commercial importance (saithe; Pollachius virens, tusk; Brosme brosme and ling; Molva molva) at a floating OWF and two floating O&G platforms off Norway to evaluate how codfish diet and habitat use may be altered by the structures. We find that differences in carbon, nitrogen and sulphur stable isotopes between offshore energy sites and control sites were lower for liver measurements (weeks prior to capture) than muscle (months prior to capture), indicating that codfish diet and habitat use was less impacted by offshore energy structures than longer-term natural feeding variation. Size explained some isotopic differences between sites in saithe, and condition differences between sites in tusk; suggesting that the diet and habitat use of the three species is not significantly impacted by offshore structures. However, we found evidence of lower condition in ling at Hywind Tampen OWF, corresponding to lower nitrogen isotope liver values in ling; that may indicate trade-offs in shelter and diet provision.

We quantified morphology in 133 species spanning the Dipteran phylogenetic and size range, and for a subset of 46 species, we combined high-speed stereoscopic videography with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to characterize wingbeat kinematics and aerodynamic performance, respectively. Our results reveal that morphology is strongly structured by phylogeny, whereas wingbeat kinematics are broadly conserved across Diptera, reflecting dominant aerodynamic constraints. Two basal lineages, Culicomorpha (mosquitoes and midges) and Tipulomorpha (crane flies), exhibit strikingly divergent kinematics and aerodynamics, suggesting lineage-specific selective pressures. Scaling analyses show that smaller species compensate for reduced aerodynamic force production efficacy through relatively larger wings, and higher wingbeat frequencies. Moreover, miniaturization is constrained by increased viscous drag at low Reynolds numbers, causing a plateau in aerodynamic power reduction with decreasing size. We further demonstrate that mosquitoes exhibit disproportionately high aerodynamic and acoustic power, coupled with enlarged flight musculature, consistent with sexual selection favoring acoustic signaling during in-swarm mating. This trade-off highlights how reproductive pressures can override aerodynamic efficiency.

Brain oscillations can control signal transmission in brain networks by modulating the timing and excitability of sender and receiver areas. For effective transmission, signals should arrive at target areas when their excitability is maximized. For reciprocally connected neural populations, this mechanism works if the transmission delay matches the period of their evoked oscillation. However, the mechanisms underlying such development of the connections with matched delays remain elusive. While transmission delays in brain networks change during development, the process by which delays are tuned for efficient transmission is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the well-known Hebbian learning rule can provide a mechanism for selecting connections with delays that match the period of network oscillations. We consider a reciprocally connected bi-layer network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that generate network-level oscillations spontaneously or in response to external stimuli. When exposed to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), the network self-organizes to potentiate connections with delays matching the oscillation period, while depressing those with non-matching delays.

The spleen acts as a major plasma cell reservoir, with perivascular localization conserved in mice and lupus patients. Relapse after anti-CD19 CAR-T occurred through newly-generated B cells rather than treatment-resistant clones. Plasma cell depletion by anti-BCMA CAR-T failed to eliminate some precursors that become autoantibody-secreting. These findings demonstrate that continuous B cell-to-plasma cell differentiation, not intrinsic plasma cell longevity, sustains pathogenic antibody responses in lupus, supporting a potential benefit of adjunctive therapies after CAR-T, particularly in genetically predisposed patients.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Previously, we reported high levels of CNNM1 expression in the testicular germ cells of neonatal mice, which were maintained in the SSCs of pubertal and adult mice. CNNM1 exhibited a progressive decline in expression levels as the SSCs progressed through the spermatogenic differentiation sequence. However, the specific functional role of CNNM1 during spermatogenesis remains elusive. Here, we studied the expression pattern of Cnnm1 during gonocyte to spermatogonia transition (GST), and expression levels were found to be higher at the initial establishment phase of SSCs marked with a higher rate of cell proliferation. GDNF mediated self-renewal/proliferation of the C18-4 spermatogonial cell line enhanced the expression of CNNM1. Overexpression of CNNM1 in C18-4 spermatogonial cell lines resulted in the upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, nucleic acid metabolism, male germ cell development and various pathways involved in cell cycle regulation, whereas CNNM1 knockdown altered the cell cycle progression. Based on the expression analysis and proteome profiling, we conclude that CNNM1 regulates and maintains the self-renewal, proliferation, and survival of mouse spermatogonial cells.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

WMAs are established on community lands to ensure the protection of wildlife and their habitats along the fringes of centrally managed protected areas like National Parks and Game Reserves. A recent cross-sectional study of the Ifakara-Lupiro-Mang'ula (ILUMA) WMA in the south of the country suggests that small, authorized fishing camps established legally inside the designated conservation area act as resident custodian communities who actively collaborate with the WMA to enforce conservation of the surrounding forest ecosystem. Here a retrospective cartographic analysis of a longitudinal series of surveys of human, livestock and wildlife activities across ILUMA between 2022 and 2025 reveal a clear increase of illegal timber harvesting in forested areas around custodian communities immediately after they were displaced by extreme floods in 2024. Furthermore, recorded narratives of resident members of these fishing camps indicate that charcoal burners, timber harvesters and even game meat poachers have taken advantage of such absences to exploit the forest undetected. These observations further support the view that resident custodian communities living within WMAs may play vital roles in conservation efforts, particularly in settings where financial resources for enforcement of regulations are limited.

While traditional likelihood-based methods are available, deep learning offers a powerful, simulation-based alternative.

This model analyzes phylogenies--containing both extant species and fossils--simulated under a complex skyline Fossilized Birth-Death model that incorporates mass extinctions and fluctuating background rates. We validate the architecture's effectiveness through ablation studies. Our investigation revealed that the stochasticity of the simulation was a primary obstacle, creating significant \"label noise\" that initially limited performance. A direct comparison showed our deep learning approach performed slightly better than Bayesian methods. It is robust to uncertainty in phylogenetic branch lengths and topology and generalizes to larger trees, but its performance degrades under model mismatch with higher background extinction rates. However, our work highlights a critical limitation: the model is highly specific to the definition of mass extinction it was trained on. Consequently, any modification to this definition necessitates retraining a new model from scratch.

Across multiple datasets and profiling approaches, the infiltrative zone showed reduced cellular heterogeneity compared with the tumor core. By comparison with an integrated reference of single-cell RNA sequencing data, we revealed that this reduction reflects a preferential differentiation of infiltrative GBM cells toward an oligodendrocyte-like lineage, accompanied by attenuated inflammatory signaling. In contrast, necrotic and proliferative regions display pronounced astrocyte-like and mesenchymal-like programs. Combined immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the enrichment of oligodendrocyte-like tumor cells in the infiltrative area.

L.; Smith, E.; Sweeny, A.; Pedersen, A. B.", "abstract": "Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases and safeguard public health. Yet, most new vaccines fail in late clinical trials, and even established ones often underperform in populations apart from those in which they were initially tested. This can lead to reduced vaccine responsiveness, breakthrough infections, and prevent or delay herd immunity. While the causes of vaccine hyporesponsiveness remain difficult to identify, quantify, and therefore address, numerous reports indicate a predominant role of environmental factors. This has notably been demonstrated by a reduction in the immunogenicity and efficacy of various vaccines when transitioning from urban to rural human populations. Here, we tested whether and, if so, how the environment can cause vaccine hyporesponsiveness. We hypothesised that if the leading causes of vaccine hyporesponsiveness were environmental, then the reduced efficacy would be exacerbated when individuals are under nutritional stress; specifically predicting that high quality diet supplementation would increase vaccine responsiveness. Finally, we predicted that parasitic helminth infection, which are more common in rural populations, would degrade vaccine responsiveness, e.g. due to their ability to suppress host immunity, and that anthelmintic treatment could rescue vaccine responsiveness in infected individuals. To test these hypotheses, we coupled lab and field experiments with structural causal modelling, and measured antibody responses of paired conspecific cohorts of laboratory-reared and wild wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) to a single or two doses of diphtheria toxoid vaccine formulated with alum; with and without diet supplementation. We found that vaccine-specific IgG1 antibodies were {approx}47% lower in the wild wood mice compared to the laboratory reared population. We also demonstrate that, across both habitats (wild and lab), substantial variation in vaccine responsiveness was caused by diet. However, contrary to our predictions, this high quality dietary supplementation resulted in lower vaccine responsiveness. Further, once the effects of habitat, diet, and sex were adjusted for, increasing helminth infection burdens negatively affected vaccine-specific antibody production. Using counterfactual modelling, we show that targeting anthelmintic treatment at heavily infected individuals would have improved their vaccine responsiveness by 2 to 4-fold. Our results indicate that the wild environment and access to a high-quality diet play a dramatic role in shaping the immune systems response to immunisation. Further, we show that laboratory settings, even when using a genetic diverse, nontraditional model, may systematically overestimate vaccine performance by failing to capture natural environmental variability. Our study provides a robust, causally explicit modelling approach to disentangle and quantify the complex factors that drive vaccine responsiveness in focal populations. This framework offers a pathway for predicting vaccine performance across diverse populations and identifying targeted interventions to enhance immunisation outcomes in real-world settings.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

We attenuated ACD across distinct striatal regions, finding that ACD attenuation specifically in ventral striatum (VS) increased decision noisiness and impaired reward-guided choice. This effect was largely due to a reduction in win-stay behavior. Using in-vivo calcium imaging, we found that VS ACD correlated with reward prediction errors (RPEs). Furthermore, these trial-by-trial ACD fluctuations predicted trial-by-trial choice variability. Finally, ex-vivo slice electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed two mechanisms through which astrocytes could regulate behavioral variability: by regulating presynaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance, and by sharing RPE signals across populations of striatal neurons.

In Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), disordered neural dynamics have been reported, but their nature and consistency remain incompletely understood. Here, we study brain criticality, excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance, combined excitation-inhibition strength (E+I), and complexity of brain dynamics associated with MDD. Using resting-state EEG from 183 patients with MDD and 133 healthy controls (HC), we identified disruptions of critical dynamics and excitation-inhibition balance which discriminate groups. We found that amplitude bistability is lower, and long-range temporal correlations are weaker in MDD, implying deviation from criticality. Excitation-inhibition metrics show frequency-specific alterations in MDD. Estimates of excitation-inhibition ratios (E/I) derived from the statistical properties of amplitude fluctuations show higher values in HC than MDD in the theta band, indicating relative over-excitation, and lower values in the gamma band, indicating relative over-inhibition. An excitation-inhibition strength index reflecting combined excitatory and inhibitory drive (E+I), was decreased in theta through beta bands and increased in gamma in MDD. Collectively, excitation-inhibition measures suggest decreased inhibitory drive in the mechanisms underlying theta oscillations in MDD and increased inhibitory drive in the mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations. Classification using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression achieved high accuracy and the predictive feature set includes measures of criticality, E/I ratios, and combined E+I strength.

Here, we introduce TF-MAPs, a scalable and general platform to chart complete functional maps of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. We apply TF-MAPS to three human disease TFs: HNF1A, FOXG1 and FOXP1. Allostery in all three proteins is distance-dependent, anisotropic, and couples the DNA-binding interface to the protein surface. The allosteric surfaces of FOXG1 and FOXP1 are quite diverged, revealing a potential for protein-specific regulation in protein families. All three TFs have potentially druggable pockets where mutations have strong functional effects on binding, either within the binding interface or distant from it. Using TF-MAPS it should be possible to chart functional and allosteric maps for hundreds of human TFs and other DNA-binding proteins to understand DNA recognition and TF regulation, to mechanistically interpret clinical variants, and to guide the development of TF-modulating therapeutics.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

The molecular chaperone DNAJB6, a J-domain protein that partners with Hsp70s and nucleotide exchange factors, is very potent in preventing amyloid formation of proteins with large intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), including several disease-associated proteins. Complementary to this, we recently demonstrated a role for DNAJB6 in surveilling IDP phase transitions, highlighting its role in nuclear pore complex assembly. Here, we further show that DNAJB6 and the closely related DNAJB2 and DNAJB8 prevent several FG-rich nucleoporins (FG-Nups) from undergoing aberrant phase-transitions. We demonstrate that this surveillance mechanism of DNAJB6 is encoded in an unusually highly conserved IDR that promotes the formation of stable, gel-like assemblies of the chaperone itself. These assemblies likely provide a stable environment that can outcompete homotypic FG-Nup interactions and instead favors dynamic, multivalent heterotypic chaperone:FG-Nup interactions. The evolutionary conservation of the DNAJB6-IDR and mutant analyses suggest that the sequence space for encoding stable gel-like assemblies is narrow and optimized to avoid self-aggregation while providing remarkable anti-amyloidogenic capacity.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Using BRD4 as a model, we identified twelve clustered sites in its C-terminal IDR and showed that O-GlcNAc decreases condensate size while increasing fluidity in vitro and in cells. Removing O-GlcNAc strengthened BRD4 binding at active enhancers and promoted LLPS-mediated co-recruitment of transcriptional factors, including YTHDC1, leading to altered expression programs linked to the cell cycle and DNA repair.

Leveraging foundational gene embeddings and incorporating interaction information can help address these challenges, improve gene network analysis, and enable the detection of subtle changes that drive disease progression or drug response. Results: We finetuned gene embeddings from foundation models using healthy tissue gene expression data and used them in temporal GNNs to model gene expression of responder and non-responders to treatment in 3 disease datasets - ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis. Application of our method to these datasets confirmed known mechanisms associated with drug action and also identified key differences between activated and repressed pathways for responders and non-responders including B-Cell activation and mitochondria related activity in ulcerative colitis patients. Conclusion: Finetuning gene embeddings from foundation models provide a richer context to model gene expression data compared to using them in their naive state.

Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized immunological mechanism whereby mEGFR exploits cGAS-STING innate immune signaling, conventionally regarded as tumor-suppressive, to sustain oncogenic signaling and therapeutic resistance. Mechanistically, mutant EGFR kinase aberrantly incorporates into STING signalosomes, directly phosphorylating STING (Y245/Y314) and TBK1 (Y577/Y677), stabilizing and hyperactivating TBK1 proteins, and establishing an unexpected and kinase loop critical for DNA damage repair. Disruption of this mEGFR-STING-TBK1 axis, genetically or pharmacologically, profoundly sensitized resistant patient-derived NSCLC organoids to chemotherapy. Combining TBK1 inhibition with cisplatin notably eradicated mEGFR-driven tumors in spontaneous and immunocompetent NSCLC murine models and patient-derived organoids.

Oct4, a master regulator of pluripotency, exemplifies this capacity as it can bind nucleosome-occupied DNA. Yet, how Oct4 reshapes chromatin fibres beyond the scale of a single nucleosome has remained unclear. Here, we harness our near-atomistic coarse-grained chromatin model to dissect how full-length Oct4 interacts with chromatin fibres of varying nucleosomal repeat lengths. We find that Oct4 increases DNA accessibility not by decondensing chromatin, but by driving fibres into compact liquid-like states in which nucleosomes breathe, reorient, exchange neighbours, and transiently expose DNA. Oct4 binds preferentially to linker DNA through its structured POU domains, while its disordered activation domains mediate cluster formation: a three-stage process consisting of nucleation of small clusters, attachment to chromatin via the DNA binding domains, and growth that is amplified when long DNA linkers enable fibre bending and looping. Oct4 clusters deform chromatin and bridge distal DNA segments in a stoichiometry- and linker length-dependent manner, revealing a tunable mechanism for controlling higher-order structure. Together, our results establish how Oct4 exploits multivalency, nucleosome breathing, and chromatin flexibility to reorganise fibres into liquid-like states that reconcile condensation with enhanced accessibility, providing a physical route to overcome the transcription-factor \"search problem\" and activate silenced genes during reprogramming.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

However, studying Dmd is difficult due to its size, low-abundance transcripts, and with multiple isoforms, limiting the sensitivity and isoform resolution of standard sequencing methods. To overcome these limitations, we applied Xenium spatial transcriptomics to target splice junctions, enabling isoform-specific and exon 51 skipping events detection across brain regions and cell types. Using this approach, we analyzed mdx52 mice lacking the full-length and Dp140 isoforms, treated with two exon 51 skipping therapies (antisense oligonucleotides or AAV-U7ex51). We observed distinct spatial expression patterns in the wild type brain between the full-length isoforms (Dp427c/m/p1) and shorter isoforms (Dp71 and Dp40). The full-length isoforms were predominantly expressed in cortex layers 2/3-6b and the CA1 region, while the shorter isoforms were localized to cortex layer 1 and the dentate gyrus.

However, comparing these studies remains difficult due to variations in analytical methods and focus. To address this, we conducted an integrative analysis of 13 studies (16 datasets) using a unified bioinformatic pipeline to identify common and stress-specific methylation responses. Our results show that the number and distribution of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) vary by stress type and methylation context CG, CHG, and CHH. CG DMRs were primarily located in gene bodies, while CHG and CHH DMRs were enriched in transposable elements (TEs). Gene Ontology analysis revealed consistently enriched stress-related terms across conditions, indicating shared epigenetic regulation. As TEs have been proposed to act as stress sensors and regulators of nearby gene expression, we examined gene-proximal TEs in more detail. We found significant enrichment of stress-responsive methylation changes in LINE/L1, RathE1_ons, and DNA/HAT elements. While stress-induced methylation is often considered transient, many affected CG DMRs overlapped with loci known to accumulate stable epimutations over generations, suggesting that stress may contribute to long-term heritable epigenetic variation. These findings enhance our understanding of epigenetic regulation in plant stress responses, highlighting both shared and stress-specific methylation dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

The underlying neurophysiology is often studied by having observers view pictures varying in affective content. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promise in modeling visual recognition of objects, their capacity to model visual affective processing remains to be better understood. In this study, we proposed a biologically inspired deep neural network model, referred to as the Visual Cortex Amygdala (VCA) model, that integrates a vision transformer with an amygdala-mimetic module designed to reflect both the anatomical hierarchy and self-attention-based computational mechanisms of the human brain. We evaluated the model along three dimensions: (1) predictive accuracy for emotional valence and arousal, (2) representational alignment with human amygdala activity, and (3) neural mechanisms of emotion representation. Our results showed that (1) the model can predict with high accuracy human emotion ratings on 1,182 images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) dataset (valence r > 0.9; arousal r > 0.7), (2) the model's internal representations aligned with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from the human amygdala, and (3) at the single neuron level, the amygdala module evolved emotion selectivity, and at the neuronal population level, the representational geometry became progressively more aligned with psychological models of emotion. Additional issues explored included (1) the effect of visual encoding and (2) the effect of structure and computational mechanisms on emotional assessment.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Segregation of speech into syllables is a key step in neural speech processing. It relies on the alignment of neural activity with the rhythmic structure of speech. Two neurological mechanisms have been suggested: phase-resetting of existing neural oscillations, or evoked responses to acoustic features of the speech signal. From EEG experiment, it is known that a distinct feature of this neural entrainment is that its strength is correlated with phonemes sharpness. Here, we reproduce this EEG experiment in-silico. In particular, we use a biophysical neural mass model to simulate the neural response to the same near-isochronus, consonant-vowel stimuli as the EEG study. We compare this to the response of two other, phenomenological, models that are designed to represent the proposed mechanisms: one a phase-resetting oscillator, the other an evoked-response filter. The biophysical neural mass model captures population-level oscillations without being tailored to speech. All three models can reproduce the correlation between phoneme sharpness and entrainment strength. While both the phase-resetting and evoked models succeed in reproducing the experimental result, the phase-resetting model is arguably more parsimonious since it does not require the preprocessing the evoked model needs to convert a sound envelope into features. Interestingly, the neural mass model also succeeded, without being tailored to the stimulus, unlike the other two models. For example, it does not respond at a specific stimulus-targeted frequency and it is robust across different parameter settings. Our results suggest that generic oscillatory dynamics in cortical populations may be sufficient to generate sharpness-dependent entrainment to speech.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Early alterations in astrocyte perisynaptic functions have been observed in AD, yet the molecular underpinnings remain poorly characterized. Here, we hypothesized that local protein synthesis, a critical mechanism for maintaining astrocyte polarity and subcellular compartmentalization, could be impaired at early AD stages. METHODS We studied the effect of oligomeric Ab on mRNA translation by imaging puromycylated-nascent protein chains in primary astrocytes alone or in coculture with neurons. To further characterize effects on astrocyte translation, we extracted by translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP), ribosome-bound mRNAs from hippocampal astrocytes and perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAP) in wild type (WT) and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP) mice at 5.5 months, a pre-symptomatic stage corresponding to the initiation of Ab plaque formation. mRNAs were analyzed by high throughput RNA sequencing and compared between genotypes and astrocyte compartments. Results were further verified by RT qPCR in purified hippocampal synaptogliosomes as well as gliovascular units, and by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). We addressed the role of the Janus Kinase (JAK) Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, a master regulator of reactive astrocytes, on the early mRNA expression and distribution in astrocytes by astrocyte-specific viral gene transfer of the pathway inhibitor Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3) in hippocampal astrocytes in WT and APP mice. RESULTS Ab induced global and local translational perturbations in primary astrocytes. 5.5 months APP PAPs showed prominent translational changes compared to whole APP astrocytes and WT. They were related mainly to axon development, neurotransmitter transport, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Some upregulated mRNAs accumulated in APP PAPs from 3 months, but not in astrocyte perivascular processes (PvAP). From this stage, Serpina3n total mRNAs encoding the serine protease inhibitor A3 accumulated in astrocyte soma and PAPs, and this effect was rescued in PAPs upon JAK STAT3 inhibition. DISCUSSION Our findings show that in APP mice, significant translational changes predominantly occur in PAPs at pre-symptomatic stages of AD. They are sustained, as observed for Serpina3n, by the upregulation and distribution of total mRNAs specifically in PAPs from 3 months. The JAK-STAT3 pathway contribute to the distribution of Serpina3n mRNAs in APP PAPs as early as 3 months. These early local events could be related to soluble Ab as well as early synaptic dysregulations sensed by PAPs, which may trigger local astrocyte reactivity. Thus, targeting local translation in astrocytes may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract early synaptic alterations in AD.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

This immune imprinting explains that infection or vaccination with currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants primarily recalls cross-reactive memory B cells and antibodies induced by prior Wu spike (S) glycoprotein exposure rather than priming de novo responses. The magnitude and persistence of immune imprinting in mRNA vaccinated populations and the prospect to overcome it are not understood. To understand the impact of immune imprinting, we investigated memory B cell and plasma antibody responses after administration of multiple doses of XBB.1.5 and JN.1/KP.2 updated COVID-19 vaccine boosters. We found that administration of the JN.1/KP.2 booster elicited broadly neutralizing antibody responses against recently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants that were accounted for by recall of Wu S-induced immunity. We detected an increased fraction of serum antibodies and particularly memory B cells recognizing XBB.1.5 S and KP.2 S, but not Wu S, relative to individuals who received a single XBB.1.5 booster a year prior. These findings suggest that repeated exposures to antigenically divergent S trimers contribute to progressively overcoming immune imprinting and support vaccine updates and innovation to provide continued protection against COVID-19.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Design We analyzed 60 young adults stratified by HLA-DQ2/8 status (28 carriers, 32 non-carriers). Over 8 weeks, we collected fecal and salivary metagenomes, serum metabolomes, dietary records, and clinical phenotypes. We combined species-level and strain-level analyses of microbiome composition and function, HLA class II binding predictions of microbial gene products, and structural modeling of HLA-DQ-microbial peptide complexes. Results HLA-DQ2/8 carriers showed higher gut microbial -diversity, elevated Gut Microbiome Health Index, and fewer virulence genes. Gut species composition differed significantly by genotype (PERMANOVA p<0.01), and species-level profiles predicted genotype with high accuracy (LASSO AUC=0.90). Strain-level divergence was identified in 15 gut species, with functional specialization in peptidoglycan, indole, and coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathways; Blautia obeum was the principal contributor to CoA-related differences. At the gene level, GO enrichment highlighted membrane-associated processes across gut and saliva, suggesting adaptation at the host-microbe interface. Microbial genes with predicted HLA-DQ binding occurred at lower prevalence than non-binders, and AlphaFold3 modeling confirmed haplotype-specific microbial peptide-HLA interactions. Serum metabolomics revealed lower pantothenate in carriers, with reduced HDL-cholesterol, heart rate, neutrophil and basophil counts; HDL-cholesterol correlated positively with pantothenate. Conclusions HLA-DQ2/8 genotype is associated with the adult microbiome at strain and functional levels through antigen-presentation-mediated selection, with systemic signatures in vitamin B5/CoA metabolism and HDL-cholesterol.

Its active moiety, manogepix, inhibits Gwt1 which is an enzyme essential for the assembly and attachment of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors to cell wall proteins. Manogepix has a strong fungistatic activity against most human pathogenic fungal species. Here we characterized the activity of manogepix against the major human pathogenic mold Aspergillus fumigatus. We show that manogepix susceptibility is linked to the expression of gwt1, the gene encoding Gwt1, thereby demonstrating that overexpression of gwt1 can confer resistance. In agreement with a previous study conducted with a different fungal pathogen, we observed an increase of cell well chitin after manogepix treatment. Using a luciferase-based reporter assay, we show that manogepix activates the cell wall integrity stress response pathway. However, manogepix only occasionally causes cell lysis. Mutants that lack the cell wall stress sensor Wsc1 or the Rho GTPase Rho4, which is important for septum formation, are slightly more susceptible to manogepix. In contrast, mutants that lack the Rho GTPase Rho2 or the cell wall stress sensor MidA, both of which are key for A. fumigatus to survive cell wall stress caused by granulocytes, heat and other cell wall perturbing chemical compounds, grow better than wild-type when exposed to manogepix. We show that both mutants, especially {Delta}rho2 but also {Delta}midA, fail to upregulate cell wall chitin to wild-type-like levels in response to manogepix. These results implicate a role for the Rho2-dependent stress response in the fungistatic activity of manogepix against A. fumigatus.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe respiratory infections in children and older adults. Several vaccines have recently been approved, which are all based on the RSV fusion (F) protein. Among the strategies to induce a broader immune response is the development of live-attenuated RSV vaccines, for example by disabling nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). RSV NS1 has been found to modulate the host immune response by repression of interferon (IFN) production. However, functional characterization of this protein was mainly performed in immortalized cell lines, which do not necessarily represent the in vivo situation. Here, we assessed the effect of NS1 mutations on replication and host responses in differentiated primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI), which mimic several physiological properties of the human airways. Using a newly developed yeast-based RSV reverse genetics system, inactivating mutations in the NS1 gene were introduced. These mutations did not affect viral replication in Vero and A549 cells. However, in HNEC we observed a delayed replication of the NS1 mutants compared to the WT virus. Bulk RNA sequencing data from early post infection revealed a stronger antiviral signature in HNEC that were infected with NS1 mutants compared to WT, characterized by upregulation of IFN-{beta} and IFN-{lambda}1/2/3 and chemokines CXCL11 and CCL5. This signature was confirmed by analysis of the cytokines that were released into the HNEC basal medium. Finally, the basal medium containing these cytokines was used for an indirect immune cell migration assay. In this set-up, both WT and NS1 mutant viruses induce migration of mainly neutrophils. In conclusion, this study shows that RSV NS1 supports viral replication not only via inhibition of the production of IFNs, but also by reducing early chemokine production and secretion by epithelial cells. Furthermore, our data highlight the suitability of the ALI transwell model for preclinical assessment of live-attenuated vaccine candidates.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate gut microbiota variation in Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) chicks and adults across six British populations using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We find that chick microbiotas show strong population-level structuring that disappears in adults, with spatial patterns particularly pronounced in anaerobic bacteria. Puffin microbiotas become increasingly individualised and aerotolerant with age, while taxonomic richness remains stable; patterns that contrast with the convergent, richness-increasing trajectories observed in several mammalian species.

At the same time, the ecosystems providing the services are under constant pressure from anthropogenic activities, causing loss of biodiversity. Since all species are connected to each other via interaction networks, the loss of one species can trigger additional, secondary extinctions. However, the consequences of these secondary extinctions for ecosystem services are not known. Here we address this gap by coupling threats to species and their interaction networks, and these networks to ecosystem service provisioning. We use a highly resolved food web dataset of the Barents Sea, and simulate secondary extinctions using Bayesian networks. We explore a range of assumptions on how the loss of service-providing species translates to the disintegration of the services they provide. We find that activation of threats cause secondary extinctions of service-providing as well as supporting species which negatively affect ecosystem services, and that the magnitude of these effects are highly dependent on the sensitivity of consumers to resource loss as well as service robustness. We also show that the indirect effects from species interactions causes substantial decreases in service provisioning. Understanding the linkages between ecological threats, species interactions in ecological networks and ecosystem service provisioning will be an important tool for guiding management strategies for effective ecosystem service management.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Every organism requires a minimum intake to meet maintenance needs, and every trophic transfer dissipates part of the energy flow as heat. Classical theory has emphasized lower bounds on supply---the minimum resource level required for consumers to persist---yet the possible upper bounds and their role in limiting food-chain length remain unclear. We develop a thermodynamically grounded framework that reveals a triad of boundaries: (i) consumer thresholds, (ii) a basal protection limit that reframes the paradox of enrichment as a thermodynamic constraint, and (iii) environmental or physiological supply caps. We show that the intersection of these three boundaries determines the exact range of conditions under which a given ecosystem structure can occur, and that within this range trophic configurations arise as the unique solution that maximizes energy flow. As chain length increases, consumer thresholds rise while the basal protection limit falls, causing this range to contract and eventually disappear. Whether this limit is reached depends on the relative position of these two boundaries and the external supply cap. Their crossing defines an energetic ceiling: a thermodynamic bound on food-chain length beyond which no further level can be sustained. Our results show that feasibility conditions are directly shaped by thermodynamic laws, providing a mechanistic explanation for the emergence and limits of trophic systems.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

It facilitates molecular evolution and has been characterized in a variety of biological systems, but studies of prokaryotic promoters are limited. Prokaryotic promoters are non-coding DNA sequences that regulate transcription. The main housekeeping promoters (sigma70) share two sequence motifs called the -35 and the -10 box that are spaced 17+/-1 base pairs (bps) apart. The sequence of these boxes, their distance, and the existence of multiple nearby boxes can determine promoter strength, the ability of a promoter to drive high levels of transcription. Here we used computational modelling to show that the mutational robustness of sigma70 promoters - the persistence of promoter strength upon mutation - correlates with promoter strength itself. Mutational robustness is also influenced by potential overlaps between -10 and -35 boxes, and by specific positions within the boxes. It is higher when the boxes are exactly 17 bps apart. These findings can be partially explained by the flexibility of -35 boxes, which enables adjacent bases to create overlapping and new -35 boxes.

In addition, cancer cells expressing a myelodysplastic syndrome-associated splicing factor mutation (SRSF2P95H) are more sensitive to one of these compounds than those expressing the wild-type version of the protein. Transcriptome analyses showed that this compound causes widespread changes in gene expression in sensitive SRSF2P95H-expressing cells. Our results demonstrate the utility of using a yeast-based HTS to identify compounds capable of changing pre-mRNA splicing outcomes.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

However, challenges persist regarding EV isolation, particularly in their co-isolation with impurities such as soluble proteins and lipoproteins. Among the methods available for EV isolation, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is widely used, as it is reproducible and amenable to high-throughput with a rapid turnaround time. However, its size-based separation leads to the co-isolation of EVs with impurities of similar size. This study, for the first time to our knowledge, compares SEC columns with different pore sizes, 20 and 35 nm, to evaluate their efficacy in non-EV contaminant removal and EV recovery from pancreatic EndoC-BH1 cell culture media and human plasma. To assess EV purity and yield, we compare EV particle concentration, the presence of unintended co-isolates, and RNA EV cargo. This study demonstrates that smaller pore size SEC columns enhance EV yield and purity, making them ideal for biomarker studies involving limited biological samples or downstream analysis sensitive to contaminants.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Chemically defined poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based microgels are produced via parallelized step-emulsification microfluidics, enabling scalable production. This approach leverages the self-organization of iPSCs with microgels to build three-dimensional constructs, driven by robust cell-material interactions achieved through vitronectin-coated PEG microgels. This technology allows the iPSCs to expand and retain their pluripotency, after which they can be differentiated into the three germ layers, providing a suitable platform for organoid differentiation.

Suppressor Of Variegation 4-20 Homolog 1 (SUV420H1) is a protein lysine methyltransferase that writes H4K20me3. Approximately 35% of HPV-negative HNSCC tumors carry gains/amplifications of SUV420H1. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed enrichment of proliferation-, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)- and immune-response pathways in SUV420H1-overexpressing HPV-negative HNSCC tumors. Depletion of SUV420H1 led to decreased proliferation, cell cycling and invasion in human HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines, while enzymatic inhibition decreased the invasive capacity but not the proliferation and cell cycling of HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines, supporting the presence of catalytically-independent and -dependent functions of SUV420H1. In a syngeneic mouse model of mouse oral carcinoma 1 tumors (MOC1), Suv420h1 knockout (KO) in MOC1 cancer cells halted tumor growth and synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy. In the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of Suv420h1 KO MOC1 tumors, a significant increase in the macrophage compartment with a concurrent decrease in the protumorigenic granulocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs) was observed. Genome-wide mapping of SUV420H1-mediated H4K20me3 revealed enrichment of EMT-, IFN-response, and myeloid-attracting chemokines.

At high plasmid copy numbers, the intracellular equilibrium of tetA+ and tetA- plasmids robustly responds to tetracycline through rapid evolutionary dynamics.

H.; Rieke, F.; Euler, T.; Deistler, M.; Berens, P.", "abstract": "Visual processing starts in the outer retina where photoreceptors transform light into electrochemical signals. These signals are modulated by inhibition from horizontal cells and sent to the inner retina via excitatory bipolar cells. The outer retina is thought to play an important role in contrast invariant coding of visual information, but how the different cell types implement this computation together remains incompletely understood. To understand the role of each cell type, we developed a fully-differentiable biophysical model of a circular patch of mouse outer retina. The model includes 200 cone photoreceptors with a realistic phototransduction cascade and ribbon synapses as well as horizontal and bipolar cells, all with cell-type specific ion channels. Going beyond decades of work constraining biophysical models of neurons only by experimental data, we used a dual approach, constraining some parameters of the model with available measurements and others by a visual task: (1) We fit the parameters of the cone models to whole cell patch-clamp measurements of photocurrents and two-photon glutamate imaging measurements of synaptic release. (2) We then trained the spatiotemporal outer retina model with photoreceptors and the other cell types to perform a visual classification task with varying contrast and luminance levels. We found that our outer retina model could learn to solve the classification task despite contrast and luminance variance in the stimuli. Testing different cell type compositions and connectivity patterns, we found that feedback from horizontal cells did not further improve task performance beyond that of excitatory photoreceptors and bipolar cells. This is surprising given that horizontal cells are positioned to mediate communication across cones and that they add to the model's number of trainable parameters. Finally, we found that our model generalized better to out of distribution contrast levels than a linear classifier. Our work shows how the nonlinearities found in the outer retina can accomplish contrast invariant classification and teases apart the contributions of different cell types.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Therapeutic approaches involving DMT have been proven to promote positive mental health outcomes in various patient groups. This study aimed to evaluate the possible efficacy of DMT on the subjective perceptions of quality of life, satisfaction with life, and personal well-being of a sample of healthy adults aged over 65.

Comparison of pre- and post-DMT scores by repeated measures ANalysis Of VAriance (rmANOVA) showed a positive effect of DMT, especially in terms of overall quality of life and social relationships. Participants in the over-70s age group who showed significantly lower scores than their younger counterparts in terms of overall quality of life, Social subscale, and PWI, exhibited analogous DMT-related changes.

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a valuable experimental model to study immunity and the pathophysiology of brain infections. The exact cellular pathways through which brain-specific immune responses are mounted in Drosophila, however, remain poorly characterized. Here, we investigated how brain-specific or systemic infection with Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli bacteria activates the Drosophila NF-{kappa}B innate immune pathways Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) in the central nervous system of the fly. We tested the hypothesis that these pathways are acutely activated in the Drosophila brain, and that their activation persists over time, even if bacteria have been cleared. We demonstrate that in control genotypes, brain-specific bacterial infection leads to Drosomycin (Drs, Toll pathway) and Diptericin B (DiptB, IMD pathway) upregulation and that glia appear to be the primary cell type mounting this immune response at both early and later stages of infection, although some activation is observed in neurons as well. We show that the upregulation of Drs and DiptB expression also depends on canonical components of the Toll and IMD pathways, respectively. Interestingly, we found that systemic infection with M. luteus leads to brain-specific Drs activation and that signals from the fat body and hemocytes can activate the Toll pathway in the brain, pointing to an inter-organ communication. Together, these results contribute to our understanding of how non-lethal bacterial infections result in activation of NF-{kappa}B immunity in Drosophila brain that could potentially be targeted to prevent progression of neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we sought to define the mechanisms whereby IL-36 may contribute to the over-activation of type I Interferon (IFN) responses observed in SLE. Methods: We carried out single-cell (sc)RNA-seq in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with IL-36 (n=5 donors). We compared the genes and transcriptional networks that were induced by IL-36 with those that were upregulated in a published SLE scRNA-seq dataset (n=33 cases and 11 controls). In follow-up studies, we validated the effects of IL-36 on monocytes by real-time PCR (n=9 donors) and flow-cytometry (n=6). Results: Classical monocytes were the immune population most affected by IL-36 treatment (n=203 Differentially Expressed Genes). In these cells, IL-36 upregulated transcriptional networks (regulons) driven by IRF7, a key activator of type I IFN responses. A similar upregulation of IRF7 regulons was observed in the monocytes of SLE cases, where measurements of IL-36 and IRF7 activity were significantly correlated (r=0.35, P=0.02). Experimental follow-up studies in human monocytes showed that IL-36 downregulates multiple RNAse genes (RNASE1, RNASE6, RNASET2). IL-36 treatment of monocytes also increased the percentage of apoptotic cells (45% vs 37% in untreated cells; P=0.001), which are a critical source of self-nucleic acids. Conclusion: We find that IL-36 promotes monocyte apoptosis while downregulating self-nucleic acid clearance. Thus, IL-36 contributes to the accumulation of self-nucleic acids, a key driver of type I IFN responses in SLE.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

Using a nanoluciferase (Nluc)-expressing attenuated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the open reading frames (ORF) 3a and 7b ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc), we characterized resistance profiles of two broadly protective NAbs targeting the S receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (1301B7) and the stem helix domain (SH) in S2 (1249A8). Serial passaging of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc under selective pressure identified a 1301B7 antibody-resistant mutants (ARM-B7) harboring an RBD mutation (S371F) that conferred resistance to 1301B7 and other RBD-directed NAbs (Casirivimab, SC27 and Sotrovimab). In contrast, no ARM emerged under treatment with 1249A8, or an antibody cocktail of 1301B7 (RBD) + 1249A8 (SH). These findings demonstrate that S2 SH-targeting NAbs shows higher genetic barrier to resistance than S1 RBD-targeting NAbs, and that a NAbs cocktail therapy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD and S2 SH offers the most effective strategy to prevent the emergence of escape mutations.

The most severe manifestation of COVID-19 is observed in the distal lung, where SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in massive inflammation and barrier breakdown. To date, few therapies are approved for clinical use in COVID-19 patients partially due to the lack of highly translational pre-clinical models of the alveoli. Human-derived microphysiological systems pose a promising new class of in vitro models to study viral infection in a relevant context. Therefore, we aimed to develop a Lung-on-Chip (LOC) model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection at the alveolar barrier. Using an immortalized alveolar epithelial cell line, AXiAEC, and human lung microvascular endothelial cells (hLMVEC) we established a SARS-CoV-2 infection model on a LOC system. The LOC models the alveolar epithelial/endothelial barrier under physiological breathing motion. Our results demonstrated that AXiAEC maturation at the air-liquid interface (ALI) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infected the breathing LOC model and induced breakdown of the air-blood barrier. Finally, we evaluated the application of the LOC SARS-CoV-2 infection model for efficacy testing and demonstrated the antiviral effect of remdesivir. Drug treatment not only inhibited viral replication but also protected the alveolar barrier from damage and partially reverted SARS-CoV-2-mediated transcriptional dysregulation in AXiAEC. This novel LOC infection model recapitulates aspects of COVID-19. Our results highlight the importance of physiological cues such as ALI and stretch to accurately model host-pathogen interactions in the distal lung.

L.; Spormann, A.; Cremer, J.; Grembi, J. A.", "abstract": "Microorganisms capable of producing hydrogen sulfide have been associated with inflammatory diseases within the human gastrointestinal tract. Using a weighted protein homology search followed by phylogenetic fragment insertion, we sought to characterize the diversity and prevalence of microbial dissimilatory sulfite reduction genes (dsrAB) from over 70,000 human gut samples from publicly available metagenomic sequencing data. We found over 1,700 unique dsrAB sequences that were predominantly within two clades of sulfate- and sulfite-reducing microorganisms (SSRM): the well-studied Desulfovibrionaceae family and the Firmicutes group sensu lato (s.l.). We detected SSRM in over a third of adults, but very few children. Bilophila wadsworthia was the most prevalent SSRM, and along with other members of Desulfovibrionaceae, constituted the majority of SSRM found. About one fifth of people with SSRM contained members of the Firmicutes group s.l. Our study characterizes the overall diversity of SSRM in the human gut from different global populations while highlighting the potential importance of SSRM from the Firmicutes group, which have commonly been overlooked as contributors to microbial hydrogen sulfide production in the human gut.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

S.; Emerman, M.", "abstract": "Host immune factors shape viral evolution. The HIV-1 Vif protein counteracts viral hypermutation caused by the host cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G), ensuring productive infection. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS) across two divergent HIV-1 clade B Vif proteins, we systematically mapped the mutational landscape governing their antagonism of A3G. These high-resolution fitness maps define conserved and adaptable regions of Vif, illuminating core principles of host-virus coevolution. Most missense mutations were strongly deleterious, reflecting pervasive purifying selection. Yet several highly conserved residues at binding interfaces with A3G, RNA, and CBF{gamma} exhibited unexpected mutational tolerance, revealing structural flexibility at these sites. Comparative analysis revealed shared constraints and striking differences between HIV-1 strains, shaped by epistatic interactions and additional selective pressures, including Vif antagonism of A3H and PP2A. By pinpointing evolutionary vulnerabilities and adaptive mechanisms, this study provides a framework for understanding viral plasticity and developing targeted strategies to disrupt Vif-mediated immune evasion.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

C.; AHUMADA-MANUEL, C. L.; CHAVEZ-MARTINEZ, A. I.; GUZMAN, J.; Estrada, K.; Espin, G.; Nunez, C.", "abstract": "Azotobacter vinelandii, a member of the Pseudomonadaceae, produces the exopolysaccharide alginate during vegetative growth; however, the circuitry linking alginate biosynthesis to lifestyle transitions remains poorly defined. Here we show that the Ribbon-Helix-Helix (RHH) transcription factor AmrZ coordinates alginate production, intracellular c-di-GMP levels, and motility. Deletion of amrZ abolished alginate synthesis, whereas chromosomal complementation restored it. A PalgD-gusA fusion and RT-qPCR demonstrated that algD, the first gene in the alginate biosynthetic cluster, depends on AmrZ for expression. Motif analysis identified multiple AmrZ sites upstream of algD, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) confirmed specific binding to these regions. AmrZ also positively autoregulates: PamrZ-gusA activity decreased in {Delta}amrZ, and purified AmrZ bound the amrZ promoter in EMSA. Moreover, PamrZ activity required the sigma factor AlgU, consistent with the presence of an AlgU promoter; this positive, AlgU-dependent feedback may stabilize AmrZ under alginate-inducing conditions. To probe AmrZ control of c-di-GMP, we implemented a riboswitch-based biosensor in A. vinelandii. The DamrZ strain showed a markedly reduced signal, similar to a diguanylate cyclase (DGC) mutant; whereas a phosphodiesterase (PDE) mutant displayed elevated output, validating the assay. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR identified two DGC genes, AVAEIV_RS11610 and AVAEIV_RS18795, as AmrZ-activated targets; EMSA verified direct binding at the RS11610 regulatory region. By contrast, transcription of the principal vegetative DGC AvGreg was not AmrZ-regulated. Lower c-di-GMP in DamrZ correlated with larger swimming halos. Collectively, these genetic, biochemical, and transcriptomic data support a model in which AmrZ directly activates algD and elevates c-di-GMP via selected DGCs, thereby promoting alginate synthesis while reducing motility. RNA-seq data also indicate that AmrZ influences broader cellular programs, including metabolism and ion homeostasis, positioning AmrZ as a central regulator that links c-di-GMP homeostasis to coordinated exopolysaccharide production in A. vinelandii.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}

L.; Mbalaviele, G.", "abstract": "Evidence indicating that inflammation is commonly associated with ectopic osteogenesis in certain autoimmune and infectious conditions challenges the dogma that inflammatory responses always suppress bone formation. In this study, we find that systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mice causes not only inflammation in bone marrow, as expected, but also stimulates periosteal bone formation. This response can be reproduced in vitro as bone marrow supernatants from LPS-treated mice induce robust osteogenesis of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) compared to supernatants from PBS-treated counterparts. Periosteal bone accrual is partly dependent on periosteal leptin receptor-positive (LepR)+ SSCs but not bone marrow LepR+ or adiponectin (Adq)+ SSCs and correlates with pyroptosis within bone marrow. Consistent with the dependence of periosteal osteogenesis on pyroptosis, this response is slightly attenuated in Nlrp3-/- or caspase-1-/- mice but significantly inhibited in caspase-11-/-, caspase-1-/-;caspase-11-/-, or Gsdmd-/- mice. Our study reveals a novel role for pyroptosis in which lysed cells release intracellular contents that stimulate osteoprogenitors and promote osteogenic differentiation within the periosteal compartment.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Evidence of local adaptation in threatened bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) populations in Puget Sound", "doi": "10.1101/2025.10.20.683549", "authors": "Abbott, E.; Alves-Lima, C.; Toft, J.; Alberto, F.", "abstract": "Stark declines in the abundance and distribution of bull kelp and reduced genetic diversity have been observed in Puget Sound, Washington, especially in southernmost areas. Consequently, introducing new variation through genetic rescue (GR) has emerged as a promising restoration strategy. However, GR success hinges on the preservation of local adaptation, which has not yet been studied in the region. To that end, we performed whole-genome sequencing on 100 gametophyte individuals from our biobank, sourced from 14 populations across Puget Sound. We identified three genetic clusters, corresponding broadly to southern Puget Sound (SPS), Whidbey Basin (WB), and the Strait of Juan de Fuca (SJF). Despite low genetic diversity and high genetic load, we found evidence of local adaptation to five environmental variables. Although salinity emerged as the strongest predictor of environmentally associated genetic variance overall, in SPS the primary drivers were average winter sea surface temperature (SST) and seasonal turbidity. We identified SNPs and enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and analyzed their allele frequencies to assess functional variation between clusters. These frequencies revealed marked differences between SJF and the other clusters, while for most genes, the highest-frequency allele in WB was also most prevalent in SPS. However, for all genes linked to winter SST and turbidity, SPS harbored distinct alleles not found in any other cluster. These findings suggest that a WB population would likely be a strong candidate donor for SPS due to its higher genetic diversity and shared adaptive variation. Further experiments are needed to validate these results and assess the suitability of WB populations for GR.", "date": "2025-10-20", "journal": ""}
