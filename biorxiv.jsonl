R.; Marenduzzo, D.", "abstract": "Transcription is a fundamental cellular process, and the first step of gene expression. In human cells, it depends on the binding to chromatin of various proteins, including RNA polymerases and numerous transcription factors (TFs). Observations indicate that these proteins tend to form macromolecular clusters, known as transcription factories, whose morphology and composition is still debated. While some microscopy experiments have revealed the presence of specialised factories, composed of similar TFs transcribing families of related genes, sequencing experiments suggest instead that mixed clusters may be prevalent, as a panoply of different TFs binds promiscuously the same chromatin region. The mechanisms underlying the formation of specialised or mixed factories remain elusive. With the aim of finding such mechanisms, here we develop a chromatin polymer model mimicking the chromatin binding-unbinding dynamics of different types of complexes of TFs. Surprisingly, both specialised (i.e., demixed) and mixed clusters spontaneously emerge, and which of the two types forms depends mainly on cluster size. The mechanism promoting mixing is the presence of non-specific interactions between chromatin and proteins, which become increasingly important as clusters become larger. This result, that we observe both in simple polymer models and more realistic ones for human chromosomes, reconciles the apparently contrasting experimental results obtained. Additionally, we show how the introduction of different types of TFs strongly affects the emergence of transcriptional networks, providing a pathway to investigate transcriptional changes following gene editing or naturally occurring mutations.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

In this study, we characterize the geographical distribution, optical mechanism, genetic basis, and ecological and evolutionary importance of metallic color variation in the Nebria ingens complex, an alpine ground beetle in the Sierra Nevada, California. We find that elytral color varies continuously across two allopatric species (from black N. ingens to green N. riversi), with hybrid populations showing intermediate coloration, and we demonstrate that the metallic color is generated from multilayer reflectors in the epicuticle of the elytra. By applying association mapping in natural populations (wild-GWAS) using high-density genotype variants, we identify five promising candidate genes covarying with metallic variation, with known roles in cuticle formation and pigmentation pathways. This finding, together with a significant correlation between color variation and water availability, suggests that metallic variation evolves as a local adaptation to environmental variation in the N. ingens complex.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

The genes present on nucleomorph genomes can be used for phylogenomic reconstruction in order to unravel the evolutionary origin of all red complex plastids and provide data independent from previously analyzed plastid-encoded proteins. Here, we leverage these genes in a first attempt at pinpointing the position of cryptophyte nucleomorphs within a comprehensive diversity of Rhodophyta, including new sequence representatives from seven deep-branching red algae. Our analysis, supported by a series of rigorous topology tests, places cryptophyte nucleomorphs as sister to the extremophilic, freshwater subphylum Cyanidiophytina. This conflicts with previously published analyses based on plastidial genes that placed red complex plastids closer to the mesophilic Rhodophytina.

Two distinct mechanisms underpin multicellularity: clonality (serial cell division without sister-cell separation) and aggregation (whereby independent cells assemble into a multicellular entity). Clonal and aggregative multicellularity are traditionally considered mutually exclusive, with rare exceptions, and evolutionary hypotheses have addressed why multicellularity might diverge toward one or the other extreme. Both animals and their sister group, the choanoflagellates, are currently only known to acquire multicellularity clonally. Here, we show that the choanoflagellate Choanoeca flexa forms motile and contractile cell monolayers (or \"sheets\") through multiple mechanisms: C. flexa sheets can form purely clonally, purely aggregatively, or by a combination of both processes. We characterise the life history of C. flexa in its natural environment - ephemeral splash pools on the island of Curacao - and show that C. flexa undergoes reversible transitions between unicellularity and multicellularity during cycles of evaporation and refilling. Different splash pools house genetically distinct strains of C. flexa, between which aggregation is constrained by kin recognition. We show that clonal-aggregative multicellularity serves as a versatile strategy for the robust re-establishment of multicellularity in this variable and fast-fluctuating environment. Our findings challenge former generalisations about choanoflagellates and expand the option space of choanozoan multicellularity.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

L.; Vanhersecke, Z.; Omotosho, J.; Mather, J.; Muthukrishna, M.", "abstract": "Social factors have been argued to be the main selection pressure for the evolution of large brains and complex behavior on the basis of data from mammals and birds. Coleoid cephalopods (octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish) have large brains, complex nervous systems and show signs of intelligent behavior comparable to that of primates, cetaceans, and birds. However, many cephalopods live largely solitary, semelparous, short lives, and many are cannibalistic, leaving little to no opportunity for parental care, complex group dynamics, or social learning. This suggests that the large brains found in cephalopods are not the result of social selection pressures. Here, motivated by the predictions of the \"Asocial Brain Hypothesis\", a yet untested regime of the Cultural Brain Hypothesis formal model, we compare the relationships between brain size and social, ecological, and other factors in cephalopods. Consistent with the prediction that ecological factors should be the primary selection pressure with larger brains in more calorie-rich complex ecologies, we find that shallower and benthic (seafloor) habitats - arguably more complex environments than open-ocean (pelagic) habitats - are associated with larger brain sizes, and that measures of sociality are not. Our findings from these highly divergent evolutionary lineages, which diverged from vertebrates over 500 million years ago are not causal, but are consistent with the \"Asocial Brain Hypothesis\" mechanistic model that describes how ecological selection pressures can also produce large, complex brains.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Human perception is robust under challenging conditions, for example when sensory inputs change over time. Temporal adaptation in the form of reduced responses to repeated external stimuli is ubiquitously observed in the brain, yet it remains unclear how repetition suppression aids recognition of novel inputs. To clarify this, we collected behavioural and electrocorticography (EEG) measurements while human participants categorized objects embedded in visual noise patterns after first viewing these patterns in isolation, inducing adaptation to the noise stimulus. We furthermore manipulated the availability of object information in the visual input by varying the contrast of the noise-embedded objects. Our results provide convergent behavioral, neural and computational evidence of a benefit of temporal adaptation on sensory representations. Adapting to a noise pattern resulted in overall faster object recognition and better recognition of objects as object contrast increased. These adaptation-induced behavioral improvements were accompanied by more pronounced contrast-dependent modulation of object-evoked EEG responses, and better decoding of object information from EEG activity. To identify potential neural computations mediating the benefits of temporal adaptation on object recognition, we equipped task-optimized deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with different candidate mechanisms to adjust network activations over time. DCNNs with intrinsic adaptation mechanisms, such as additive suppression, best matched contrast-dependent human performance benefits due to adaptation, whilst also showing improved object decoding as a result of adaptation. Networks that use temporal divisive normalization, a biologically-plausible canonical neural computation, additionally showed robustness to shifting objects, suggesting that temporal adaptation via divisive normalization aids stable representations of time-varying visual inputs. Overall, our results demonstrate how temporal adaptation improves sensory representations and identify candidate neural computations mediating these effects.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

L.; Desrochers, T. M.", "abstract": "Completing sequences is a routine part of daily life. Many are abstract, defined by a rule governing the order rather than the identity of individual steps (e.g., getting dressed). In obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), excessive ritualistic behaviors suggest a disruption in abstract sequence completion. Executing abstract sequences requires at least two levels in a hierarchy of cognitive control: abstract sequential control (tracking steps) and task switching (shifting between tasks). While task switching has been studied in OCD, little is known in a sequential context. Understanding both hierarchical control types is key to uncovering how abstract sequences with nested task switches are processed in OCD. Previous studies showed that the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) supports abstract sequence monitoring in healthy individuals with an increase in activity across each sequence, a dynamic known as 'ramping'. Ramping outside the RLPFC is potentially indicative of other sequence-related processes such as progress towards a goal and increasing working memory load. Therefore, we hypothesized that abstract sequential control deficits would correspond to altered ramping dynamics in RLPFC and other cortical regions. Second, we predicted task switching deficits in OCD, coupled with altered activity in cortical regions canonically implicated in task level control. We found partial support for both hypotheses. Abstract sequential control did not show behavioral differences in OCD but did show increased overall ramping in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and superior frontal sulcus (SFS) and ramping differences in additional, novel cortical regions according to abstract sequence complexity. In contrast, behavioral differences were observed for task switching in OCD without neural differences between the groups. Together, these results suggest a group of areas support sequential control differentially in OCD than in healthy controls, despite behavioral similarity, and that this observation is likely not the result of neural deficits in task switching. These findings thus provide insight into OCD during complex behaviors more similar to daily life where sequence and task level control are intertwined and may inform future potential treatment.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

W.; van Heeswijk, R. B.; Lutti, A.", "abstract": "Purpose: Cardiac pulsation increases the noise level in brain MR images. Maps of the transverse relaxation rate R2* and magnetic susceptibility (QSM) are particularly affected by cardiac-induced noise as they are computed from gradient-echo data acquired at multiple echo times. Here, we introduce two data acquisition strategies to mitigate the impact of cardiac-induced noise in brain maps of R2* and QSM. Methods: The proposed strategies are based on the higher level of cardiac-induced noise near the k-space centre. Using a pseudo-spiral sampling trajectory, the first strategy allows for the acquisition of a specific number of averages at each k-space location, set from the local level of cardiac-induced noise. The second strategy synchronizes the acquisition with the cardiac cycle in real time. We compared in 10 healthy volunteers, the variability of data acquired across 4 repetitions and in the same session, using both strategies and with a standard linear trajectory. Results: Compared to linear sampling, the pseudo-spiral trajectory reduced the variability of R2* and QSM maps across repetitions by 26/28/22% and 19/18/16% in the brainstem/cerebellum/whole brain, for a 14% increase in scan time. The pseudo-spiral sampling also reduced the level of aliasing artifacts from pulsating blood vessels. The cardiac-triggered trajectory did not reduce the variability of R2* or QSM maps. Conclusion: Pseudo-spiral k-space trajectories can be designed to mitigate cardiac-induced noise in brain maps of the MRI parameters R2* and QSM. Synchronization of the acquisition with the cardiac cycle in real time did not lead to any reduction in cardiac-induced noise.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Yet, the mechanistic basis of this disease, and of the KCNC1 disease spectrum, is unclear. KCNC1 encodes Kv3.1, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that is highly and selectively expressed in neurons capable of generating action potentials at high frequency, including parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in cerebral cortex (PV-INs) known to be important for cognitive function and plasticity as well as control of network excitation to prevent seizures. In this study, we generate a novel transgenic mouse model with conditional expression of the Ala421Val pathogenic missense variant (Kcnc1-A421V/+ mice) to explore the specific physiological mechanisms of KCNC1 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Our results indicate that global heterozygous expression of the A421V variant leads to cognitive impairment, epilepsy and premature lethality. We observe decreased PV-IN cell surface expression of Kv3.1 via immunohistochemistry, decreased voltage-gated potassium current density in PV-INs using outside-out nucleated macropatch recordings in brain slice, and profound impairments in the intrinsic excitability of cerebral cortex PV-INs (but not excitatory neurons) in current-clamp electrophysiology. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging revealed altered basal activity in Kcnc1-A421V/+ PV-INs and excitatory cells, as well as hypersynchronous discharges correlated with brief paroxysmal movements that were subsequently shown to be myoclonic seizures on electroencephalography. We found alterations in PV-IN-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission in young adult but not juvenile Kcnc1-A421V/+ mice relative to wild-type controls.

In the present study, we reported that short-term HFCD (Choline Deficient High Fat Diet)-fed mice, which did not show significant signs of hepatic damage and inflammation in the first two weeks, are more susceptible to a non-severe sepsis-like systemic inflammation induced by LPS challenge. Mechanistically, endotoxemic mice show an excessive accumulation of NK-producing IFN-{gamma} cells in liver tissue, which trigger the recruitment and polarization of a distinct subset of neutrophils, characterized by high expression of PD-L1 and massive release of TNF. Remarkably, genetic inhibition of IFN-{gamma} or pharmacological blockade of PD-L1 effectively modulated the excessive recruitment of these neutrophils to the liver and TNF- production, thereby preventing hepatic damage and reducing the severity of host mortality.

UV crosslinking (reCRAC) revealed that in glucose conditions Pin4 binds mRNA 3' UTRs with preference for a specific motif in mRNAs involved in glycolysis, amino acid, and mitochondrial metabolism. Following glucose withdrawal, Pin4-RNA binding was greatly reduced, with residual binding favoring transcripts associated with protein translation. Cells lacking Pin4 were greatly impaired in recovery from nutrient starvation and hypersensitive to oxidative stress, consistent with the mRNA targets. RNAseq and reporter assays indicated that loss of Pin4 correlated with some increases in target mRNA abundance. In wildtype yeast, glucose depletion induces diauxic shift, with massive changes in transcription patterns. Unexpectedly, this response was almost entirely abolished in cells lacking Pin4, its C-terminal prion-like domain, the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) or with an RRM point mutation.

Many of these interactions are mediated by membrane-anchored molecules such as proteins or specific lipids, which we refer to as \"mobile tethers\" since they can typically diffuse within the membrane while still interacting with the condensate. The presence of mobile tethers creates a surface with dynamic and spatially inhomogeneous wetting properties that are typically overlooked by traditional wetting theories. Here, we propose a general theoretical framework to study how mobile tethers impact both equilibrium and dynamic properties of condensate wetting. We show that a favorable tether-condensate interaction leads to tether enrichment at the condensate-membrane interface, which modifies the equilibrium surface tension and contact angle. Increasing tether abundance on the membrane can drive transitions between wetting regimes, with only a modest tether density and binding energy required for biologically relevant scenarios. Furthermore, tethers modulate how condensates react to complex membrane geometries. By helping condensates coat membranes, mobile tethers can facilitate condensate localization to junctions of membrane structures, such as the reticulated membranes inside the algal pyrenoid. Both tether abundance and mobility affect how droplets interact with complex membrane geometries, such as droplet migration along membrane tubules of varying radii. These results provide a framework to study the implications of tether-mediated condensate-membrane interactions for cellular organization and function.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Using immunolabeling for two transcription factors, Sox9 (specific to macroglial progenitors and astrocytes) and Sox10 (specific to oligodendrocyte lineage), we determined their density, distribution within and across cortical layers and distance to the blood vessels from postnatal day (P) 5 and P60 in the somatosensory cortex. We found that Sox9+ cells are evenly distributed in the cortex with regular intercellular distances and comparable densities between the upper and lower parts of the cortex. In contrast, Sox10+ cells are predominantly concentrated in the lower cortical layers, and exhibited a more random distribution with variable distances between cells. Finally, while confirming the increased density and branching of the vascular network after P5, we also showed that macroglial cells are closer to blood vessels from P15 onward. In summary, VeCell provides a valuable tool for analyzing the development and spatial organization of macroglial cells. Our findings in the cortex reveal distinct patterns of distribution and proximity to the vasculature for macroglial cells during postnatal development.

ACE has two catalytic domains, located in the N-terminal or C-terminal region of the protein, but little is known about the roles that these two catalytic domains play in regulating endogenous opioid degradation in brain tissue. Using acute brain slice preparations from mice of both sexes, we developed methods to study degradation of Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (MERF) by ACE, and investigated the role of each ACE catalytic domain in MERF degradation. Using mutant mouse lines with functional inactivation of either the N-terminal domain or the C-terminal domain, we incubated acute brain slices with exogenous MERF at a saturating concentration. The degradation MERF to produce Met-enkephalin was only reduced by N-terminal domain inactivation. Additionally, application of a selective N-terminal domain inhibitor (RXP407) reduced degradation of both exogenously applied and endogenously released MERF, while a selective C-terminal domain inhibitor (RXPA380) had no effect. Taken together, our results suggest that the ACE N-terminal domain is the primary site of MERF degradation in brain tissue, and that N-terminal domain inhibition is sufficient to reduce degradation of this specific endogenous opioid peptide.

As a label-free and minimally invasive technique, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of coenzymes NADH and NADPH (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H) offers the possibility to resolve cellular metabolic profiles with high spatial precision. However, NAD(P)H FLIM capacity to detect subtle variations in neuronal metabolism has not been demonstrated. In this study, we applied NAD(P)H FLIM to map the metabolic profiles of Drosophila neurons in vivo across multiple scales, focusing on the primary centers for associative memory: the mushroom bodies (MBs). At a broad scale, we obtained an overview of the metabolic signatures of the main brain tissue and identified a marked difference between neuropil and cortex areas. At a finer scale, our findings revealed notable heterogeneity in the basal metabolic profiles of distinct MB neuron subtypes. Measurements performed after associative olfactory learning also uncovered a low-magnitude subtype-specific metabolic shift associated with memory formation, suggesting the utility of NAD(P)H FLIM in detecting physiology-driven changes linked to brain function. These results establish a promising framework for studying the spatial heterogeneities and the dynamics of cerebral energy metabolism in vivo.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

NRGRank is based on a coarse-grained evaluation of pairwise atom-type pseudo-energy interactions that implicitly accounts for compound and side-chain flexibility as well as limited backbone movements. We compare NRGRank to docking-based virtual screening software Glide, Autodock Vina and DOCK 3.7 on the DUD-E virtual screening benchmark using enrichment factors at 1% (EF1). We observe broad variations of EF1 values across targets, structural models and methods. For apo form or AlphaFold2 models, out of a subset of 37 targets from DUD-E, NRGRank has better EF1 values than Glide for 12 and 13 targets respectively. Even in holo form, where the accuracy of classical docking software increases, NRGRank has better EF1 values than 13, 10 and 5 targets out of 37 compared to AutoDock Vina, DOCK 3.7 and Glide respectively. Comparing the rank of true binders in Glide and NRGRank shows that true binders ranked in the top 1% are complementary between methods irrespective of the target form (AlphaFold, apo or holo). That is, utilizing NRGRank detects binders that are missed by Glide (and presumably other methods), whereas those found by Glide are missed by NRGRank. Furthermore, we observe that most hits found by NRGRank within the top 50 predictions (4.38 {+/-} 5.49 hits on average for AF2 targets) remain once the top 1% of predictions are re-scored with Glide, but the hit rate within the top 50 predictions increases. NRGRank can evaluate one molecule in 0.3 s on average, enabling a modern laptop with 8 cores to screen 1,000,000 molecules in 24 hours, up to two orders of magnitude faster than the reported speed of DOCK 3.7, AutoDock Vina running on GPUs and Glide. NRGRank occupies a unique niche among tools for virtual screening being insensitive to structural inaccuracies but with comparable accuracy as state-of-the-art docking methods and fast as AI-based methods but without the dangers of overfitting as it is based on 780 pseudo-energy parameters. Combined with the fact that NRGRank does not require extensive or expensive computational resources or expert pre-processing of targets, it is unique in making high-performance ultra-massive virtual screening accessible to all.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that morning (AM) hyperinsulinemia primes the liver for enhanced afternoon (PM) meal-associated net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU) and glycogen storage. However, depending on the meal composition, both insulin and glucagon may rise. Therefore, we investigated whether AM hyperglucagonemia alters the priming effect of AM hyperinsulinemia on subsequent hepatic glucose metabolism. Dogs underwent a 4h AM hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp paired with either basal (AM INS, n=8) or elevated glucagon (AM INS+GCG, n=8). After a 1.5h rest, dogs underwent a 2.5h PM hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamp designed to mimic postprandial conditions. AM hyperglucagonemia reduced PM NHGU through additive shifts in both hepatic glucose uptake and production, leading to lower direct glycogen synthesis and less glycolytic flux. Mechanistically, hepatic glucokinase protein was reduced in the AM INS+GCG vs. AM INS group, suggesting diminished capacity for glucose phosphorylation and lower intracellular G6P, a central node regulating downstream hepatic glucose metabolism. Thus, morning hepatic glucagon exposure diminishes insulins ability to prime the liver, limiting net hepatic glucose uptake during a later meal. These results underscore how antecedent hormonal signals govern subsequent postprandial hepatic glucose metabolism.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Animal models are important for modelling the development and progression of SVD across the lifespan. In humans, reduced FOXF2 is associated with an increased stroke risk and SVD prevalence in humans. In the zebrafish, foxf2 is expressed in pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells and is involved in vascular stability. We use partial foxf2 loss of function (foxf2a-/-) to model the lifespan effect of reduced Foxf2 on small vessel biology. We find that the initial pool of pericytes in developing foxf2a mutants is strongly reduced. The few brain pericytes present in mutants have strikingly longer processes and enlarged soma. foxf2a mutant pericytes can partially repopulate the brain after ablation suggesting some recovery is possible. Despite this capacity, adult foxf2a mutant brains show regional heterogeneity, with some areas of normality and others with severe pericyte depletion. Taken together, foxf2a mutants fail to generate a sufficient initial population of pericytes. The pericytes that remain have abnormal cell morphology. Over the lifespan, initial pericyte deficits are not repaired and lead to severely abnormal cerebrovasculature in adults.

Biodiverse grasslands support many arthropods, yet such ecosystems have declined due to land conversion and management changes. While restoration aims to conserve species-rich grasslands, long-term effects of plant richness on arthropod communities and associated functions remain underexplored. We addressed this gap by quantifying arthropods, herbivory, and predation over 13 years (2010-2022) across 80 grassland plots with varying plant richness. We examined (1) temporal trends in arthropod communities, herbivory and predation and whether changes depended on plant richness, (2) whether plant richness effects varied or strengthened over time, and (3) whether arthropod changes affected associated functions. Arthropod metrics declined over time across all plant richness levels, with average losses mainly being more pronounced in species-poor mixtures. Plant richness consistently had a positive effect on arthropods and their functions, although this effect varied between years without a consistent temporal trend. Notably, temporal changes in arthropod community metrics did not predict shifts in associated functions. Our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between plant richness and arthropods. From a conservation perspective, we can conclude that diversification in grasslands- the increase in plant diversity- directly supports arthropods and associated functions. Additionally, first trends indicate that the maintenance and protection of diverse semi-natural grasslands over a long period might mitigate the arthropod loss driven by environmental changes. In other words, diverse grasslands may buffer against the ongoing arthropod loss, though this effect may take years to become apparent. This again emphasizes the long-term nature of conservation efforts.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

However, most current methods rely on fixed-cell assays, capturing only a single time point and missing the dynamic nature of cellular responses. Live-cell imaging enables observation of these responses over time, with the potential to provide a deeper understanding of compound-specific effects and mechanisms. Despite its potential, analysing time-series image data remains a major challenge due to limited analytical tools. In this study, we present a workflow for morphological profiling using time series data from label-free live-cell imaging to yield interpretable and biologically relevant results called Live Cell Temporal Profiling or LCTP. The benefit of LCTP is showcased through a modes of action (MOA) classification study using label-free (phase contrast) data. The approach integrates several pre-existing deep learning models, such as cell segmentation, live/dead classification, and single-cell feature extraction, and data-driven models to capture MOA-specific temporal phenotypic effects. We use double-blinded cross-validation when assessing classification accuracy, as this simulates a real-world screening scenario. MOA classification accuracy is significantly improved when using LCTP compared to a single time point analysis; these results are consistent in both cell lines used in this study. Moreover, time-dependent phenotypic modelling through LCTP enables interpretable profiles that reveal transient, sustained, and delayed responses, providing insight into the temporal responses of compounds with different modes of action. The suggested workflow is modular, with each step designed to remove unwanted and irrelevant information, thereby enriching the remaining data. This modular approach also facilitates easy updates to the workflow as new technologies become available. We believe this approach offers significant value for high-throughput compound screening, demonstrating that live-cell imaging in combination with the presented workflow provides informative visualization of temporal effects and improved MOA classification.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Augmented intake reflected increases in the number of both consummatory and seeking clusters across sexes. In female Augmenters, strong correlations between consumption and seeking cluster size (i.e. measure of hedonic impact) and interlick interval indicated that heightened hedonic experience during consumption directly amplified motivation to seek drug; in males, this linkage was weaker.

Remarkably, this model shows explicitly how a fixed network can achieve flexible control of multiple behaviours through optimal mapping of sensory feedback onto the network. Finally, analytical decomposition of the controller reveals that low-dimensional network dynamics follow directly from the propagation of low-dimensional feedback signals from the biomechanical plant through the network.

A major barrier to developing effective regenerative strategies is the incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating chondrogenesis and cartilage maintenance. Cell surface proteins are key mediators of extracellular communication, adhesion, and signaling, yet the chondrogenic surfaceome remains incompletely mapped, with prior studies focusing primarily on mature or cytokine-activated chondrocytes. The aim of this study was to provide a temporal profile of the surfaceome during in vitro chondrogenic differentiation and to identify novel membrane proteins with potential roles in cartilage biology. Methods: We applied a sialoglycoprotein-targeted glycocapture strategy to selectively enrich plasma membrane proteins from chick embryonic limb bud derived micromass cultures undergoing chondrogenesis. Enriched samples underwent high-resolution shotgun proteomic analysis, and differentially expressed candidates were validated by western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and transient gene silencing. Functional effects on extracellular matrix gene regulation were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and matrix histochemistry. Results: This approach generated the first temporal surfaceome map of chondrogenic progenitors. Among identified candidates, two proteins not previously linked to chondrogenesis, podocalyxin (PODXL) and ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR), were detected at the plasma membrane and confirmed at the protein and transcript levels. Both proteins exhibited time-dependent downregulation during differentiation. Targeted knockdown revealed differential regulation of the fibrocartilage marker COL1A1 expression, indicating non-redundant roles in cell-matrix signaling and survival pathways. Single-cell transcriptomic meta-analysis confirmed expression of both proteins in discrete human articular chondrocyte subpopulations. Conclusions: This study expands the molecular framework of chondrogenesis, identifying PODXL and CNTFR as novel, temporally regulated surfaceome components with distinct roles in extracellular matrix signaling. These findings complement prior proteomic analyses of cytokine-activated mature articular chondrocytes and suggest new candidates for developmental cartilage biomarkers and therapeutic targets for osteoarthritis.

Previous studies have primarily investigated translational buffering in yeast due to genetic variation or environmental stress. However, it remains unclear how widespread translational buffering is across mammalian genes in various cellular contexts. In this study, we uniformly analyzed 1515 matched ribosome profiling and RNA-seq datasets from human and mouse. This resource enabled us to assess translational buffering by comparative analysis of variation at ribosome occupancy and the RNA expression and by examining the relationship between mRNA abundance and translation efficiency. We found that translational buffering is partly conserved between human and mouse, with homologous genes showing a moderate cross-species correlation in mRNA-translation efficiency relationships and a strong enrichment of shared buffered genes, particularly those encoding ribosomal, RNA-binding, and proteasomal proteins. Although the identified buffered genes show association with some sequence features, these alone are insufficient to predict translational buffering, highlighting the importance of cellular context. Genes exhibiting translational buffering have lower variation in protein abundance in cancer cell lines as well as human and mouse tissues. We also observed that translationally buffered genes are more likely to be haploinsufficient and triplosensitive suggesting a demand for stringent dosage limits in these genes. We hypothesize two models of translational buffering, namely \"differential accessibility model\" and \"translation initiation rate model\" with our analysis suggesting that some transcripts conform to the former and others align with the latter.

G.; Dias, M.; Frazer, J.", "abstract": "Generative models trained on natural sequences are increasingly used to predict the effects of genetic variation, enabling progress in therapeutic design, disease risk prediction, and synthetic biology. In the zero-shot setting, variant impact is estimated by comparing the likelihoods of sequences, under the assumption that likelihood serves as a proxy for fitness. However, this assumption often breaks down in practice: sequence likelihood reflects not only evolutionary fitness constraints, but also phylogenetic structure and sampling biases, especially as model capacity increases. We introduce Likelihood-Fitness Bridging (LFB), a simple and general strategy that improves variant effect prediction by averaging model scores across sequences subject to similar selective pressures. Assuming an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution, LFB can be viewed as a way to marginalize the effects of genetic drift, although its benefits appear to extend more broadly. LFB applies to existing protein and genomic language models without requiring retraining, and incurs only modest computational overhead. Evaluated on large-scale deep mutational scans and clinical benchmarks, LFB consistently improves predictive performance across model families and sizes. Notably, it reverses the performance plateau observed in larger protein language models, making the largest models the most accurate when combined with LFB.

However, recent experimental work has shown that this process can happen independently of such global cues, challenging the current paradigm. In this work, we developed a new model for PCP using the Cellular Potts modelling framework to investigate the conditions under which global tissue orientation can be achieved without a tissue spanning morphogen. We found that a combination of a local boundary signal, a small initial tissue size and uniform proliferation can effectively establish long-range polarity without the need for global cues.

We also demonstrate that downregulation of ZNF865 induces senescence and upregulation mitigates senescence and DNA damage in human nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. Importantly, upregulation of ZNF865 shifts the chromatin landscape and gene expression profile of human degenerative NP cells towards a healthy cell phenotype.

Understanding how some lineages evolved into major pathogens remains a central challenge and may be advanced by comparisons with their nonpathogenic counterparts. Integrative approaches have become essential for delimiting species and reconstructing evolutionary relationships, particularly in lineages with cryptic diversity or extensive chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we formally characterize six Cryptococcus species representing distinct evolutionary lineages, comprising both newly discovered and previously recognized but unnamed taxa, through a combination of phylogenomic analyses, divergence metrics, chromosomal comparisons, mating assays, and phenotypic profiling. Among pathogenic taxa, we formally name Cryptococcus hyracis sp. nov., corresponding to the previously characterized VGV lineage within the C. gattii complex. In parallel, we describe five saprobic, nonpathogenic species isolated from fruit, soil, and bark beetle galleries, spanning four phylogenetic clades. We identify a strong ecological association with bark beetles for Cryptococcus porticicola sp. nov., the only newly described nonpathogenic species with multiple sequenced strains from diverse sites. In this species, we detect strain-level chromosomal variation and evidence of sexual reproduction, along with population-level signatures of recombination. Across the genus, chromosome-level comparisons reveal extensive structural variation, including species- and strain-specific rearrangements that may restrict gene flow. We also identify multiple instances of chromosome number reduction, often accompanied by genomic signatures consistent with centromere inactivation or loss of centromeric identity. Comparative metabolic profiling with Biolog phenotype microarrays reveals clade-level differentiation and distinct substrate preferences, which may reflect metabolic divergence and habitat-specific diversification.

This implies that these two phenomena should exhibit similar properties. However, studies of somatosensory realignment with visuomotor adaptation have shown mixed support, possibly due to a confounding coactivation of sensory prediction errors and multisensory integration. While the former is thought to drive adaptation, both processes may contribute to somatosensory realignment. Here, we examined somatosensory realignment following force field adaptation, which is not confounded by multisensory integration. Across two experiments, we tested whether somatosensory realignment mimics three canonical properties of adaptation in this paradigm. Our first experiment examined whether sensory realignment (for the perception of movement or static position) correlated with adaptation across individuals, and generalized beyond the trained reach direction. The results showed that force field adaptation coincided with a selective realignment of somatosensory perception of movement in the direction of the perturbing force, but this realignment did not correlate with the magnitude of adaptation or generalize beyond the reach direction of the adaptation task. In a second experiment, we tested whether context-dependent dual adaptation to opposing force field perturbations coincides with a context-dependent dual realignment of somatosensory perception. The results showed no evidence of context-dependent somatosensory realignment after dual adaptation. Overall, our results indicate that somatosensory realignment and adaptation exhibit different properties and are therefore unlikely to rely on the same underlying mechanism, although realignment does display some coherence with the nature of the perturbation.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

These neurons develop hyperphosphorylated tau and demonstrate somatodendritic mis-localization. Unlike other stem cell models of tauopathy, these i3N neurons develop endogenous seed-competent tau and present pFTAA-positive tau assemblies after 28 days in culture. For scalable screening, we CRISPR-engineered a HiBiT luminescence tag at the endogenous MAPT locus into the S305N/IVS10+3 iPSC line, enabling precise quantification of tau levels and pharmacological responses. The model responded predictably to compounds affecting tau clearance, demonstrating its suitability for drug discovery.

Epigenetic dysfunction, particularly through altered microRNA (miRNA) expression, contributes to disease progression. Targeting these molecular aberrations is critical to prevent recurrence, limit metastasis and improve patient outcomes. Here, we identify the miR-214-3p/miR-199a-5p cluster as a stage-associated, tumor-suppressive network that is lost in recurrent and chemoresistant OC, but can be restored using engineered small extracellular vesicles enriched with this cluster (m214-sEVs). Using a clinically relevant mouse model that mimics spontaneous OC relapse following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, we showed that m214-sEVs were internalized by OC cells and the OC niche fibroblasts via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, resulting in the elevation of miR-214-3p/miR-199a-5p and the downregulation of chemoresistance-associated genes, including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), {beta}-catenin, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein YKT6. Moreover, secondary tumor-derived sEVs (t-sEVs) released by OC and niche cells that internalized m214-sEVs reduced pro-metastatic proteins, such as integrin {beta}1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), in their cargo and limited their capacity to promote invasion and resistance. In vitro, YKT6 overexpression in ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) attenuated the effect of m214-sEVs on sensitizing carboplatin to block OCSC migration. These findings demonstrate that engineered m214-sEVs designed to restore clinically lost tumor-suppressive miRNAs can concurrently reverse chemoresistance and reprogram tumor-derived EV communication by targeting oncogenic networks.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

The ways in which this process fails inform us of the complex mechanical conditions required for its correct completion. Previous results showed that the functional disruption of MARCKS, a protein which simultaneously interacts with the plasma membrane and actin filaments, resulted in neural tube closure defects with apical cell extrusion. Here, we demonstrate that this is an example of 'live cell extrusion', wherein extruded cells are not undergoing apoptosis. This suggests that extrusion in this case might be due to a mechanical instability in the neural plate. Using an expanded energy-based vertex model of pseudostratified epithelia we then show that extrusion may be elicited by a reduction in the relative surface tension of apical and basal interfaces with respect to cell-cell interfaces. Finally, by considering a continuum description of a simplified epithelium we derive an approximate quantitative threshold for single-layered epithelial stability in the form of a power law relating cell density to the relative value of interfacial surface tensions. Our work serves to explain an example of how alterations in polarization and forces at the single-cell level can produce tissue-scale instabilities which not only greatly alter its morphology but can also ultimately lead to severe developmental defects.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

After purifying actinorhodopsin from a cell-free expression system and from E. coli membranes upon overexpression, we demonstrated both in vitro and in silico that actinorhodopsin from Nanopelagicus ca. is a phospholipid scramblase, serving in its pentameric state as a retinal-independent phospholipid diffusion channel. Phospholipid headgroups move along a transbilayer path between actinorhodopsin protomers, to equilibrate lipid content in the inner and outer leaflets.

We explored whether a deep neural network known as AVHuBERT could provide an alternative modeling framework. AVHuBERT model variants were presented with syllables recorded from 8 different talkers. AVHuBERT identified the auditory syllable \"ba\" as \"B\" at a rate of 85%, but pairing with an incongruent visual \"ga\" reduced the \"B\" response rate to 41%, similar to the rate of 44% observed in 100 human participants presented with the same McGurk syllables.

Here we present a derivation of the solubility product showing that the solubility product is also a robust description of biomolecule phase boundaries if care is taken to account for soluble oligomers and variable composition within the dense phase. Our calculation describes equilibrium between unbound monomers, the dense phase, and an ensemble of oligomer complexes with significant finite-size contributions to their free energy. The biomolecule phase boundary very nearly resembles the power law predicted by the solubility product when plotted as a function of the monomer concentrations. However, this simple form is concealed by the presence of oligomers in the dilute phase. Accounting for the oligomer ensemble introduces complexities to the power law phase boundary including re-entrant behavior and large shifts for stoichiometrically matched molecules. We show that allowing variable stoichiometry in the dense phase expands the two phase region, which appears as curvature of the phase boundary on a double-logarithmic plot. Furthermore, this curvature can be used to predict variations in the dense phase composition at different points along the phase boundary. Finally, we show how the solubility product power law can be identified in experiments by using dilute phase dissociation constants to account for the oligomer ensemble.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

K.; Feola, E.; Rouwkema, J.; Sartori, M.", "abstract": "Studying skeletal muscle remodelling across large temporal scales is difficult because most 3D tissue-engineered skeletal muscle (3D-TESM) models cannot sustain stable development over prolonged culture. Skeletal muscle adaptations in vivo are strongly influenced by changes in tissue length, but most TESM models are mechanically restrictive, limiting elongation and thereby constraining structural remodelling. The stiffness of the pillars that anchor the tissues is a key determinant of how much they can shorten or elongate during development, thereby shaping both their morphology and force-generating capacity. To address this limitation, we investigated how TESMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) develop over two weeks when suspended between pillars with distinct mechanical properties, ranging from mechanically compliant to mechanically stiff boundary conditions. We focused on both passive and active force-generating properties. With compliant pillars, tissues compacted primarily along their length (~66% reduction), followed by progressive elongation (~50% increase) from day 5 onward. In contrast, with stiff pillars, tissues compacted across their width, with no longitudinal shortening. Despite these morphological differences, projected tissue area decreased similarly across setups. Spontaneous contractions emerged from day 7 and continued until day 14, typically occurring in bursts at 0.6-0.8 Hz. Passive force peaked early with compliant pillars and declined thereafter, while remaining relatively stable with stiff pillars. Under stepwise electrical stimulation, maximal contractility was consistently observed at ~50 Hz. Active force rose sharply between day 12 and day 14, with the steepest increase (up to 2000%) in compliant pillars. Although sample size was limited, the consistency of trends across stiffness conditions and surface treatments provides valuable insights into how boundary mechanics shape 3D-TESM development. These findings offer a foundation for designing next-generation muscle culture systems that support dynamic remodelling, force maturation, and training-responsive behaviours.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

However, the economic viability of large-scale algal cultivation in open raceway ponds is limited by biocontamination and environmental stressors, necessitating deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underpin resilience and productivity in these systems. We hypothesized that the molecular signature associated with the cellular responses of M. minutum to environmental stressors will reveal critical information for the timely prediction of resilience and productivity in algal cultures within open pond systems. Results: To test this hypothesis, we conducted a longitudinal multi-omic study, integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics, to monitor the acclimation, growth dynamics, and pathogen responses of algal cultures in two 1000 L raceway ponds, before and after the introduction of a pathogen as a stressor. We identified a number of molecular patterns that correlate with changes in the algal environment, and we can track these changes within the ponds per time. Furthermore, we identify scale-up and infection-specific molecular pathways through integrated multi-omics, showing that most patterns are unique to each studied stressor/transition.

Trial-based tasks allow their mechanistic dissection but tend to generate highly stereotypical behavior, whereas open-field investigations capture naturalistic dynamics with less experimental control. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we developed a behavioral framework which recreates dilemmas faced by animals during patch foraging. In the Tower Foraging Park (TFP), mice harvest rewards along square towers (patches) by making quarter-turns around them in a single direction (exploit) and alternating between towers (explore) as patches eventually deplete. Within a couple of sessions, naive mice performed quarter-turns in the rewarded direction with increasing vigor and reduced variability, and switched towers after short exploitation bouts. When the harvest direction was reversed, mice rapidly adapted their turning direction, with quarter-turn trajectory variability and speed becoming decoupled. Mice subjected to daily reversals adapted progressively faster, revealing meta-learning. When the next rewarding tower became harder to locate, all trained mice increased exploitation duration, although metalearners outperformed animals trained under stable contingencies. Altogether, the TFP produced behavior consistent with foraging theory and revealed new processes facilitating flexible foraging: meta-learning and the decoupling of movement variability and speed. Moreover, because the TFP accommodates diverse protocol variants, adheres to FAIR principles, and is fully compatible with modern neurophysiological techniques, it provides a promising platform for mechanistic investigations of brain functions underlying adaptive behavior while maintaining ethological validity.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

In contrast, the diffusible fraction of BMP promotes differentiation of cells by activating bam. How a single signaling pathway produces such opposing outcomes has remained unclear. Here, we show that the diffusible BMP fraction induces bam transcription by repressing the transcriptional repressor Brinker (Brk). We further found that brk mRNA displays a highly heterogeneous expression pattern within interconnected spermatogonia, suggesting that Brk may prime cell fate in a subset of transit-amplifying cells, helping to preserve a population poised for dedifferentiation while maintaining other cells for differentiation. Our findings propose a model in which a single niche-derived factor modulates reciprocal outcomes inside versus outside the niche, which is essential for the tissue homeostasis.

Here, we systematically quantify protein synthesis and clearance across over 4,200 cells from a primary tissue. Through integration with single-cell transcriptomics, we report the first quantitative analysis of how individual cell types regulate their proteomes across the continuum of gene expression. Our analysis quantifies the relative contributions of RNA abundance, translation, and protein clearance to the abundance variation of thousands of proteins. These results reveal a putative organizing principle: The contributions of both translation and protein clearance are linearly dependent on the cell growth rate. Further, we find that some proteins are primarily regulated by one mechanism (RNA abundance, translation, or clearance) across all cell types while the dominant regulation of other proteins is cell-type specific. Age related changes in protein abundance are cell-type specific and correlated to changes in protein clearance. Our reliable multimodal measurements enabled quantifying and functionally interpreting molecular variation across single cells from the same cell type. The protein-protein correlations are substantially stronger than the mRNA-mRNA ones both for directly interacting proteins and for functional protein sets. This difference is mediated by protein clearance regulation. Further, the protein correlations allow identifying cell-type specific functional clusters. These clusters vary across cell types, revealing differences in metabolic processes coordination, partially regulated by protein degradation.

Here, we integrated ocean metagenomic data with state-of-the-art habitat modeling to study LDGs of marine prokaryotes across seasons and depths on a global scale. We found a strong depth and taxonomic dependency of the LDGs: while mixed layer marine microbial communities exhibited pronounced gradients with a peak in diversity at (sub)tropical latitudes (40 S to 40 N) followed by a decline toward the poles, the communities at depth (200 to 1,000 m) showed no latitudinal structuring. The LDG in the surface mixed layer was largely underpinned by species of Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteriia, while other taxa exhibited distinct or even contrasting LDGs. Diversity structuring also varied by seasons and regions, governed by temperature, nutrients, and carbon dynamics. Together, these findings highlight that within the ocean microbiome, LDGs are not universal, but rather lineage-specific outcomes of differing ecological strategies and their responses to environmental gradients. By integrating taxonomic and spatiotemporal variability, our study provides fundamental insights into the structuring of ocean microbiome diversity and lays the foundation for predicting responses to environmental change.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Most analyses have focused on these biomarkers separately, and simultaneous detection has not yet been attempted in high grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). The aim of our study was to assess whether the tandem CTC/ctDNA approach increases HGSOC detection efficiency of peripheral blood liquid biopsy. Methods: For CTC detection, by using healthy donor samples spiked with known cancer cell numbers, we tested gene expression assays and TP53 next-generation sequencing (NGS). The latter was also applied for ctDNA detection where analytical validity was ensured by calculating the optimal variant allele frequency (VAF) threshold for mutation calling. The clinical validity of the assays was then verified on two HGSOC cohorts and respective controls. Standard 2x2 contingency tables and Wilson method were used to evaluate clinical validity, by calculating specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: High analytical sensitivity and specificity were found for both gene expression and TP53 NGS based CTC detection, as these assays specifically detected as few as five cancer cells spiked in control sample. Regarding clinical validity, the gene expression-based CTC detection showed 0.48 accuracy, 13.3% sensitivity, and 100% specificity, whereas TP53 sequencing demonstrated better assay performance (0.77 accuracy, 46.7% sensitivity, 100% specificity). For circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis, we first identified 0.31% VAF cut-off for accurate ctDNA TP53 mutation calling. Subsequent clinical validity assessment showed solid performance efficiency of the ctDNA based liquid biopsy (0.71 accuracy, 60% sensitivity, and 100% specificity), outperforming the CTC detection methods. Importantly, the tandem ctDNA/CTC analysis improved disease detection rate in both HGSOC cohorts, allowing to achieve, respectively, 73.3% and 93.3% sensitivity. Interestingly, TP53 NGS revealed CTC private variants, and shared ctDNA/CTC mutations undetected in the primary tissue, highlighting the ability of the dual-analyte approach to capture tumor heterogeneity and allow mutation cross-validation. Conclusions: Our study reveals the complementary value of simultaneous CTC and cfDNA analysis in HGSOC, advancing the translational potential of liquid biopsy integration for the management of this disease.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

K.; Abbate, M. F.; Greiff, V.", "abstract": "Motivation Protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in capturing the complex interaction patterns between amino acids in protein sequences. These models, trained on large datasets of protein sequences, can generate embeddings, high-dimensional numerical representations that encode valuable information about the structure, function, and evolution of proteins. However, conventional usage has largely been based on arbitrarily determined variable sets (embedding modes), including the choice of embedding layer, pooling method, and padding, which can potentially lead to a suboptimal representation with low information content for a given downstream task. The scalability of protein embedding mode extraction is limited by inefficiencies in both space (memory) and time (computation). (i) Accumulating all outputs in memory and writing them to disk in a single operation leads to a memory bottleneck. (ii) Additionally, repeated embedding of the same sequence to extract different embedding modes introduces unnecessary computational overhead and reduces throughput significantly. Results Here, we present PEPE (Parallel Extraction for Protein Embeddings), a command-line tool designed for high-throughput multi-modal protein sequence embedding extraction. We demonstrate that PEPEs parallel process achieves a total run time several orders of magnitude faster than sequential approaches. We also show how, SOTA peak memory usage scales with output size and fails once memory capacity is exceeded, whereas PEPEs peak memory usage remains consistently below the critical limit, allowing the extraction of multimodal embeddings that exceed the amount of available memory. PEPE supports a wide range of publicly available and custom protein language models, providing a simple command-line interface for researchers. PEPE enables the generation of protein embedding datasets at previously unfeasible scales, facilitating the identification of optimal protein embedding settings for downstream analyses without requiring additional resources for fine-tuning.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

While induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and tumor-derived cell lines have advanced mechanistic research, they are constrained by scalability, stability, and limited capacity to reproduce complex mutational states.\n\nMethodsWe developed aiAtlas, a reliable computational system that integrates Large Concept Model (LCM) based causal inference with aiPSC derived simulation libraries. The platform encodes 25 core biological and cellular features, including apoptosis, DNA damage and repair pathways, cell cycle regulation, pluripotency markers, and the hallmarks of cancer, in weighted causal networks. Simulations were iteratively propagated using early-stopping algorithms, with statistical evaluation performed using Mann Whitney U tests, Hodges Lehmann estimators (HLE), and Cliffs delta with Hedges correction. Bonferroni-adjusted significance thresholds (p < 0.002) to compensate for multiple testing were applied.\n\nResultsAcross 136 simulated aiPSC lines (10 wild type, 126 mutants), all 25 features demonstrated significant divergence between wild type and combined mutant states (median HLE -1.46, IQR -1.89 to -0.36). Subgroup analyses revealed distinct patterns: single mutations drove broad systemic changes; multiple mutations amplified genomic instability; human tumor-derived cell lines exhibited strong divergence but retained some overlap in repair and apoptosis pathways; and gene fusion models produced selective, intermediate phenotypes. Effect sizes were consistently large (Cliffs delta approaching -0.95 with 95% CIs).\n\nConclusionsaiAtlas reliably distinguishes wild type from mutant cell states, capturing both global and subgroup-specific mutational divergence.

This reliable platform establishes a new opportunity for rare diseases and cancer modeling, offering reproducible insights that can accelerate discovery and translational applications where traditional wet-lab approaches are impractical.\n\nFurthermore, in situations where the target mutational profile has been defined but no cellular models yet exist, aiAtlas can quickly generate custom virtual cell lines that precisely reproduce the corresponding genomic and phenotypic features.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Although IFN-{gamma} activates both STAT1 and STAT3, how these pathways interact to regulate immune evasion under hypoxia remains unclear. Methods: Using the MC38 murine colorectal cancer model and T cell-tumor spheroid co-culture assays, we examined how IFN-{gamma} signaling through STAT1 and STAT3 influences PD-L1 expression, CSC plasticity, and cytotoxic T cell function under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA knockdown were used to dissect pathway function, and Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelmintic, was evaluated as a dual STAT1/STAT3 inhibitor. Results: We found that IFN-{gamma} primarily induced PD-L1 through STAT1 activation, while CSC plasticity was associated with STAT3 signaling. STAT1 and STAT3 displayed reciprocal regulation-blocking one enhanced activation of the other. Niclosamide effectively inhibited phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, which led to suppressed PD-L1 upregulation and reduced CSC enrichment. In addition, it also partially inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1 expression. In co-culture assays, Niclosamide improved T cell infiltration and reduced exhaustion under hypoxic conditions, resulting in improved T cell killing. Conclusions: Our findings identified Niclosamide as a potent dual STAT1/3 inhibitor capable of reversing IFN-{gamma} and hypoxia-driven immune evasion.

Here, we present a genome-resolved metagenomic and comparative genomic analysis of facultative bacterial symbionts across 120 scale insect metagenomes from 20 different families. Our analyses reveal rich and taxonomically diverse facultative symbiont communities, dominated by the Pseudomonadota, such as Wolbachia, Rickettsia, Arsenophonus, and Sodalis. Genomic features reveal substantial variation in genome sizes, coding densities, metabolic potentials, and host-interaction genes among symbiont clades, indicating lineage-specific lifestyles and host interactions. Interestingly, alphaproteobacterial and gammaproteobacterial symbionts mostly co-occur within their respective hosts. Gammaproteobacterial symbionts exhibit broader metabolic repertoires and potential defense capabilities via the APSE phage toxin cassettes, while alphaproteobacterial symbionts retain reduced metabolic capabilities, Type IV secretion systems, and reproductive manipulation genes (cifAB and wmk).

Impaired FGF-21/KLB signaling has been linked to metabolic disorders, but its role in hypertension remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the expression of genes related to the FGF-21 signaling axis (FGF-21, FGFR1, and KLB) in the liver and central nervous system (CNS) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at pre-hypertensive (21 days) and hypertensive (90 days) stages. METHODS: Systolic tail pressure (STP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded by tail-cuff plethysmography. Gene expression in the liver, brainstem, hypothalamus, and frontal cortex was quantified by RT-qPCR and normalized to {beta}-actin. RESULTS: SHR-90d exhibited significantly higher STP compared to SHR-21d, with no difference in HR. Hepatic KLB mRNA expression was markedly reduced in SHR-90d compared to SHR-21d, while FGF-21 and FGFR1 levels remained unchanged. No significant alterations in FGF-21 pathway genes were detected in CNS regions. CONCLUSION: The selective downregulation of hepatic {beta}-Klotho in hypertensive SHR suggests a state of peripheral FGF-21 resistance, potentially linking metabolic dysregulation to the maintenance of hypertension.

The organelles and machinery of the endomembrane system, being responsible for material synthesis, intracellular targeting, uptake and secretion, are key eukaryotic hallmark to be explained. The period of eukaryogenesis after the merger of prokaryotic lineages but preceding the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, is inferred to have involved a rise in cellular complexity through expansion of organelle-specific protein machinery, but the steps and stages of organelle emergence is essentially a blackbox. This is particularly problematic since ancestral protein function is not necessarily inferable from modern components. Here we apply Ancient Protein Resurrection (Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction and molecular cell biological characterization) to explore the ancient evolution of the Arf GTPases. Arf1 is canonically understood to act in eukaryotic cells at the Golgi apparatus, while Arf6 acts at endosomes and the plasma membrane. We find that the inferred ancestral Arf1/6 protein acts at both Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane in both mammalian and yeast cells. Unexpectedly, we find that the mechanism of localization to the plasma membrane is due to a C-terminal motif found in Arf1 proteins from the wide diversity of modern eukaryotes, though not the best characterized models of yeast, plants, and humans. Our data suggests that the ancestral Arf protein acted at multiple locations in eukaryotic cells prior to the diversification of modern lineages and Arf1 proteins may do so to a greater extent than appreciated in organisms of medical and ecological importance today.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

We investigated male reproductive monopolization in wild Guinea baboons (Papio papio), an egalitarian multilevel society in which one-male \"units\" are nested within larger social groups (\"parties\") and male-male contest competition is low. Using nine years of behavioral and genetic data from five parties, we examined how reproductive success is distributed across males at different social levels. Paternity data show that 93% of the 71 infants were sired by the female's \"unit male\", with rare extra-unit paternities consistent with limited control models. Within parties, reproduction was shared among multiple unit males, resulting in low reproductive skew. The most successful males accounted for 23-40% of paternities within parties, well below the proportions reported in strictly hierarchical species. Takeovers of females were rare, suggesting male restraint. Reproductive success, assessed as the number of unit females, was positively associated with dominance ratings, yet males with average dominance ratings had the largest units. Altogether, prime-age was a better predictor of reproductive success than dominance. In conclusion, male Guinea baboons' reproductive success is shaped less by dominance and more by long-term associations with females, who play an active role in inter-sexual relationships. Our study emphasizes the need to move beyond frameworks focused solely on dominance-based mechanisms and to incorporate species-specific social organization when evaluating reproductive strategies.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

We have developed a modular platform, Interluminescence (Int), for experimental control of synaptic transmission: bioluminescent light, generated by a luciferase oxidizing a luciferin, from a presynaptic neuron is used to activate transsynaptic optogenetic ion channels in the postsynaptic neuron. Two strategies can activate or silence postsynaptic neurons in vivo in the presence of luciferin. In the Act-Int approach, a luciferase is genetically expressed in synaptic vesicles and released during depolarization-induced presynaptic vesicle fusion and exocytosis. In the Persist-Int approach, a luciferase is tethered to the presynaptic membrane where it can support sustained transsynaptic signaling. Both strategies can activate postsynaptic neurons with similar efficacy. By design, the modularity of the platform permits the use of luciferases and opsins ranging in brightness and light sensitivity, and the luciferase can be targeted to different subcellular regions of the presynaptic neuron. Our results demonstrate the utility and versatility of Interluminescence to mediate synapse-specific transmission that is either activity-dependent or activity-independent.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

M.; Cavanagh, P.", "abstract": "When two probes are flashed at different times within a moving frame they can be perceived as dramatically separated from each other even though they are at the same location in the display. This effect suggests that we perceive object position relative to the surrounding frame even when it is moving (Ozkan et al., 2021). Here, 8 experiments reveal new properties of this frame effect. First, the influence of the frame on the perceived probe positions extends beyond its bounding contours by several degrees of visual angle, both in the direction of the frame's motion and in the direction orthogonal to the motion. It is also undiminished when the probes and the frame are in different depth planes. Unlike the spread of the effect in space, the influence of the frame's motion shows no extension in time - there is no the effect on probes presented after the frame is removed and none retroactively before the frame appears either. The frame's effect is also driven primarily by the displacement of the frame, not by its motion signals: the effect is stronger for moving bounded frames compared to moving, unbounded random-dot textures. When the bounded region has an internal texture that moves with or against the frame's motion or remains static, it is the displacement of the frame that produces the perceived position shifts of the probes, while the effect of the internal motion is mostly suppressed. The frame's influence is unaffected by whether the motion is self-initiated or not and does not reduce in strength across 2 hours of testing.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Because HPAIV infection has occasionally caused outbreaks in captive rare birds, application of antiviral drugs for treatment purposes against them has been considered from the perspective of conservation medicine. In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of baloxavir marboxil (BXM) was evaluated using a duck model to help establish the post-infection treatment for rare birds. Sixteen four-week-old ducks were divided into four groups and intranasally inoculated with the HPAIV strain A/crow/Hokkaido/0103B065/2022 (H5N1). BXM was orally administered once daily at doses of 12.5, 2.5, 0.5, and 0 mg/kg to each of the four groups from 2 to 6 days post-infection. Blood samples were collected at 2, 8, and 24 hours after the initial BXM administration to measure the plasma concentrations of its active form, baloxavir acid (BXA). All ducks were monitored until 14 days post-infection, and their oral and cloacal swabs were collected for virus recovery. All eight ducks administered with 12.5 or 2.5 mg/kg of BXM survived, demonstrating a significant reduction in virus recovery compared to the 0 mg/kg group. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis of BXA suggested that parameters such as Cmax and AUC0-24hr were correlated with the suppression of virus shedding. These findings demonstrated that BXM administration within 48 hours post-HPAIV infection in ducks effectively reduced mortality and virus shedding. The comparison of PK parameters may help estimate efficient BXM dosing strategies in rare birds.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

M.; Coll, F.", "abstract": "Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), the causative bacteria of TB, is becoming increasingly resistant to anti-TB drugs, resulting in poorer treatment outcomes. The mutations arising in MTBC strains during infection provide a record of bacterial diversification and adaptation, and indirect evidence on the selective pressures and conditions that MTBC encountered in vivo, such as those exerted by the immune system and antibiotic therapies. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of MTBC sequenced strains with multiple clinical isolates sequenced from the same patient, from published studies and TB Portals. We applied stringent genomic QC criteria to keep only clonal isolates and applied robust genomic pipelines to identify mutations arising de novo during infection. A convergent evolution approach was applied to identify heavily mutated genes, operons, and candidate promoter across strains of multiple patients. We estimated the frequency of drug resistance acquisition during treatment for the subset of patients with available drug treatment data. Results: Using 5,899 high-quality genomes from 1,056 TB patients after ensuring clonality of isolate genomes we identified limited within-host diversity was identified including 3,296 fixed mutations across 501 patients. A total of 21 genes, 25 operons and 27 promoter regions were statistically enriched by mutations compared to the rest of the genome, and additional loci with established or plausible adaptive roles approaching statistical significance. Significantly, this included multiple loci known to be involved in resistance to first-, second-, and last-line anti-TB drugs. Fluoroquinolone resistance was acquired more frequently during treatment than resistance to any other anti-TB drug. Previously reported candidate drug-resistance and -tolerance genes (prpR, Rv2571c, fadD11, helY, ndhA, Rv0139, fadE5, and mce1 operon) were also identified. Genes encoding regulators (phoR, whiB6 and mycP1) and effectors (espK and eccE1) of the virulence ESX-1 locus were frequently mutated in host. Conclusions: Here we analysed a large dataset of MTBC within-host genetic diversity. We show that frequently mutated genes in MTBC during infection reveal known and biologically plausible in host adaptations, predominantly associated drug resistance, but also in genes involved in pathogenesis. The higher resistance acquisition rate observed for fluoroquinolones may have important clinical relevance. We reveal a list of candidate loci which will require mechanistic characterisation and whose impact on disease progression will need to be investigated.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

The flow profile of multiple co-flowing streams during the process, as one of the dimensions, dictates the cross-sectional morphology of the microstructures. Here, we introduce a three-dimensional hydrodynamic flow lithography (3D HFL) approach that enables rapid and programmable generation of desired flow profiles and their conversion into solid microstructures. By strategically combining multiple flow sculpting strategies, including variable inlet configurations, intra-channel pillar configurations, and outlet configurations, we achieved precise and versatile control over flow sculpting, as validated by computational fluid dynamics simulations and experimental production of microparticles and fibers, offering unparalleled design flexibility. Importantly, the flow sculpting device is fabricated using low-cost 3D-printed molds to cast PDMS channels with precisely aligned inlets and complex geometries that are difficult or impossible to achieve using conventional soft lithography. Our 3D HFL approach effectively overcomes the limitations of existing microfabrication techniques in device complexity, structural diversity, multi-material integration, and production throughput. Furthermore, we demonstrated the capability of this platform to produce anisotropic multi-material microparticles and fibers tailored for specific applications, such as amphiphilic particles for uniform microdroplet capture, biocompatible patterned hydrogels for controlled cell adhesion, and dual-layer fibers for temperature sensing.

While melanin confers photoprotection, its oxidative by-products can paradoxically extend DNA damage. Here we empirically validate an ancestry-aware computational framework coupling population pigmentation genetics with transcriptional regulation of DNA-repair pathways using Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx v9) skin RNA-seq data. We analyzed 604 GTEx donors from sun-exposed and non-exposed skin (lower leg, suprapubic) across inferred ancestry axes. Expression modules for melanin synthesis (TYR, TYRP1, SLC24A5, MC1R) and nucleotide-excision/oxidative-repair (XPC, DDB2, POLH, OGG1) were examined through differential expression, random-forest modeling, and 1,000-fold bootstrap uncertainty quantification.

We profiled DNA methylation, five histone post-translational modifications, and their transcriptional effects at bulk and cell-type-specific levels. Despite comparable tissue organization and neurophysiological responses to morphine, epigenetic adaptations occurred at highly sex-specific genomic loci. These adaptations nevertheless followed common mechanistic principles, acting at similar gene features and transcription factor binding sites across sexes. Strikingly, they converged on overlapping genes, biological functions, and co-expression modules, and partially recapitulated transcriptional signatures of OUD in men and women. Therefore, our findings uncover a profound epigenetic sex divergence that mediates convergent biological dysregulation, and highlight opportunities for developing improved therapeutic strategies tailored to sex-specific mechanisms.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

This generalizes previous results on linear networks to include a wide family of nonlinear activation functions, which enter as interaction terms in the path integral. These interactions can resolve the instability of the linear theory and yield a strictly positive participation dimension. We present explicit results for power-law activations, revealing scaling behavior controlled by the network coupling. In addition, we introduce a class of activation functions based on Pade approximants and provide analytic predictions for their correlation statistics.

Such a decrease is often linked to the impact of visual memory decay and the sensory transformation of visual target positional information into haptic-specific coordinates. It is, however, unclear whether this holds for haptically encoded spatial locations, where the target and reaching arm positions are both defined through haptics. Here, we asked participants to perform memory-guided right-handed reaching movements toward targets held with the left hand. In the Delay block, the left hand was removed after 2 seconds, and a right-handed reach was performed after a variable delay of 2, 4, or 6 seconds. In the No-delay block, the left hand was on the target for the entire duration of the trial. Targets were positioned in front (Center) and to the Left of the participants, such that the posture of the left arm during encoding was either the same or different from the final posture of the contralateral reaching arm. The introduction of the shortest delay caused a decrease in accuracy and precision, indicating that on-line haptic inputs play a crucial role in guiding reaching movements. However, performance did not worsen with longer delays, particularly when the two arms were in similar postures. Our findings suggest that postural information may contribute to guiding actions when on-line haptic feedback is unavailable.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

In contrast, our brains can adjust planning and action selection on the fly to the current context, and often make their action selection transparent by recalling related experiences. This capability results from a fundamental difference between the way how brains and current AI tools store learnt knowledge. Whereas the latter compress all experiences into parameter values, the brain also stores representations of the most salient experiences in the form of episodic memories, which support more sophisticated action selection and planning. We show that experimental data on neural codes for episodic memories in area CA1 of the brain support a method for reproducing these capabilities in artificial devices. The resulting Episodic Neighbor(EN)-algorithm complements reinforcement learning approaches by adding inherent flexibility, context-awareness, and explainability.

By comparing representations from deep video models to brain activity, we can gain insights into mechanistic solutions for effective video processing, important to better understand the brain and to build better models. Current works in model-brain alignment primarily focus on fMRI measurements, leaving open questions about fine-grained dynamic processing. Here, we introduce the first large-scale benchmarking of both static and temporally-integrating deep neural networks on brain alignment to dynamic electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of short natural videos. We analyze 100+ models across the axes of temporal integration, classification task, architecture and pretraining using our proposed Cross-Temporal Representational Similarity Analysis (CT-RSA), which matches the best time-unfolded model features to dynamically evolving brain responses, distilling 107 alignment scores. Our findings reveal novel insights on how continuous visual input is integrated in the brain, beyond the standard temporal processing hierarchy from low to high-level representations. Responses in posterior electrodes, after initial alignment to hierarchical static object processing, best align to mid-level representations of temporally-integrative actions and closely match the unfolding video content. In contrast, responses in frontal electrodes best align with high-level static action representations and show no temporal correspondence to the video. Additionally, state space models show superior alignment to intermediate posterior activity through mid-level action features, in which self-supervised pretraining is also beneficial. We draw a metaphor to a dynamic mixture of expert models for the changing neural preference in tasks and temporal integration reflected in the alignment to different model types across time.

The presence of IBG in sugi pollen enhances the production of SBP-specific IgE, which participates in inflammatory response via activation of mast cells to lead to their degranulation, resulting in sneezing. Another -glucan derived from black yeast, soluble -glucan (SBG: a dectin-1 antagonist), is known to have an anti-allergic function. Herein, we demonstrated that oral administration of SBG suppressed both SBP-specific IgE production and SBP-induced sneeze in sugi pollinosis mice model. DNA microarray analyses revealed previously unknown mechanisms underlying SBG-mediated anti-allergy action. SBG ameliorated the dysregulated expression of 16 immune-inflammatory genes that were unusually either up- or down-regulated in sugi pollinosis mice. Based on the DNA microarray informatics, it was suggested that SBG mitigated the IBG-mediated hyper-response of IgE production and inflammatory reaction in immune-inflammatory cells, B and T cells, antigen-presenting cells, and granulocytes (neutrophils and eosinophils) within iliac lymph nodes. The SBG-mediated inhibition of SBP-induced sneezing in pollinosis mice results from a decline in SBP-specific IgE level. The oral administration of SBG influenced gut microbiota, notably enhancing beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria. Consequently, it is plausible that short-chain fatty acids, produced by these beneficial bacteria, inhibited mast cell degranulation, leading to a reduction in sneezing.

Several strategies can be employed to approach such Traveling Salesman Problems. However, these may be strongly constrained by spatial scales, for instance if the goal is to navigate in a supermarket, in a city, or across a continent. Here, we monitored the route optimization performances of human subjects collecting objects in a video game simulating 3D environments at various spatial scales. Unexpectedly, route optimization performances peaked at intermediate spatial scales, where participants could use global optimization strategies. At very large and very small spatial scales, however, participants predominantly employed less efficient local optimization strategies. At the very large scale, the considerable distances between objects prevented them from being seen all at once, making global planning difficult. At the very small scale, participants reported having chosen the shortest path, although they did not. This mismatch between perceived and actual performances suggests suboptimal alternatives were sufficiently short to be considered equivalent to the optimal route. Spatial scale thus strongly influences route planning in human navigators and may determine the spatial behaviors of a wide range of animals facing similar routing problems in their everyday lives.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

C.; Bhattrai, A.; Wang, T.; Wiegand, J.-P.; Brinton, R. D.", "abstract": "Translational validity of mouse models of human aging and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk are essential for both fundamental mechanistic science and therapeutic development. Given that the strongest risk factors for LOAD are age, female sex, and APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriership, models must reflect these biological variables and disease phenotypes. The use of mouse models with humanized APOE (hAPOE) is a key strategy to advance translational validity. To initially address translational validity of the hAPOE mouse model, we conducted ex-vivo magnetic resonance imaging analysis of brain volumes in male and female mice across APOE genotypes ({varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}3, {varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}4, {varepsilon}4/{varepsilon}4) and ages corresponding to a human lifespan of approximately 30-70 years (6-25 months in mice). The primary outcomes indicated that total MRI brain volume increased with age (an average of 2.12mm3 per month), irrespective of sex or APOE genotype. Additionally, APOE-{varepsilon}4 carriers had greater total brain volumes than non-carriers. No sex differences were observed in total brain volume. Voxelwise analyses revealed a pattern of localized morphometric changes independent of differences in total brain volume. Age-related volumetric increases were distributed across subcortical regions (e.g., thalami, hippocampi), while age-related decreases were evident across cortical regions, notably the bilateral parieto-temporal and frontal lobes. Additionally, sex differences were evident after controlling for total brain volume, with females showing greater cortex-dominant volumes while males showed a pattern of greater volumes in regions including cerebellar cortices, olfactory bulbs, and striata. No genotypic effects were observed in the voxelwise analysis after correcting for multiple comparisons, suggesting that APOE genotype does not drive localized volume differences independent of total brain volume. These findings indicate that, at the MRI level of analysis, this humanized APOE mouse model does not recapitulate the volumetric atrophy typically seen in human brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. The results suggest that humanized APOE alone is insufficient to induce the LOAD atrophy phenotype. This model may better serve as a platform for studying vulnerable aging rather than a primary model for progressive neurodegenerative atrophy.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

To investigate the relationship between oscillations and memory performance, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been used to modulate LTM. However, due to the variability in stimulation parameters and locations, no clear picture has arisen on where tACS needs to be applied to improve LTM. Methods: We collected behavioral data from 20 studies (58 effect sizes) and computationally modeled the corresponding brain electric fields based on each study's unique tACS parameters. As a result, we generated a map of performance-electric field index (PEI) values using linear and quadratic fits. Results: Theta-tACS showed no regions with a positive linear association with LTM. However, left lateral prefrontal and temporal areas exhibited negative associations, meaning that theta stimulation of that region led to decreased LTM performance. A quadratic analysis revealed an inverted-U relation in the right parietal cortex, suggesting improved memory at moderate, but not high, electric field strengths. Gamma-tACS showed positive linear associations in parieto-occipital cortex and negative ones in frontal regions. For gamma, we found no regions that expressed a quadratic relationship. Conclusion: These findings indicate that LTM-relevant tACS effects are frequency- and site-specific and potentially nonlinear with respect to intensity. Integrating meta-analytic effect sizes with individualized field estimates provides a brain-wide framework for identifying targets of memory modulation and for guiding future fundamental and translational research.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

J.; Baacke, K. A.; Olshan, S. M.; Heller, W.", "abstract": "Background Advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have led to the ability to study the brain across many contexts. However, the large number of features generated by functional connectivity approaches may overfit the data. These problems can be overcome with either feature selection (FS) or dimensionality reduction (DR), which can be applied to less complex models. We utilize two open-source datasets to compare the performance of DR/FS methods on cognitive task decoding using a suite of ML classifiers. New Method While DR and FS methods have been used previously in decoding research, no systematic comparison of their performance has been undertaken. Here, we compare available methods using commonly utilized machine learning libraries to establish which methods provide the best predictive performance. We then conduct statistical tests to examine the relative contributions of DR and FS methods and classifiers on decoding accuracy. Results Neither DR or FS was found to be superior. However, differences were identified across datasets and tasks. In the majority of methods and datasets, a peak in predictive performance was found using a small percentage of the total number of original features. Comparison with existing methods Some methods perform better than the baseline method of prediction with all available features or selecting features randomly. Decoding performance utilizing the HCP datasets with certain DR/FS methods exceeds that of deep learning approaches. Conclusions Simple machine learning models with DR/FS have competitive decoding performance. These results suggest a sweet spot for the tradeoff between the retention of features and predictive accuracy.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

While this dissociation is well-established in younger adults, its integrity in healthy aging remains unclear. To address this, younger (n = 25, range: 18-25 years) and older adults (n = 25, range: 65-95 years) completed estimation and grasping tasks in two experiments. In Experiment 1, two rectangular objects with varying lengths (40 mm and 42 mm) were placed on the \"far\" and \"close\" surfaces of a Ponzo illusion. Despite age-related changes in grasping kinematics, the perception-action dissociation persisted. The Ponzo illusion influenced estimation such that objects placed on the \"far\" surface were perceived as longer. In contrast, grasping was not affected by the illusion, and even showed effect in the opposite direction, with larger apertures for objects placed on the \"close\" surface of the illusion. Experiment 2 tested whether this reversed effect was mediated by the surface size on which the object was placed, rather than perceived distance. To this end, we removed the illusory distance cues and varied only the background surface size (\"big\" versus \"small\"). While perceptual estimations were unaffected, surface size modulated grasping in both age groups, with a stronger effect in older adults. These findings indicate that the perception-action dissociation is preserved in aging, but older adults rely more on contextual cues during action, potentially reflecting compensatory mechanisms to maintain visuomotor performance.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Microbiomes that enhance host performance are likely to be co-introduced with hosts during colonization due to their intimate association. Yet, it is unclear how co-introduced microbes will impact host colonization, as both the microbiome and its effects could vary upon introduction into a new habitat. Here, we used duckweeds -a cosmopolitan, freshwater angiosperm- and their microbiome to track colonization dynamics during an experimental co-introduction in the wild. Notably, we found that host performance was substantially reduced when plants were co-introduced with microbes non-local to the introduced habitat, relative to hosts with a local microbiome. Moreover, negative impacts from the non-local microbiome persisted for multiple host generations despite a rapid turnover in microbiome composition during colonization. Overall, we suggest that considering the co-introduced microbiome can help predict host colonization success under global change.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Recent research in endemic host populations shows that Plasmodium reduces survival in juveniles, but not adults. Additional research is needed to understand 1) age-based variation in the impact of Plasmodium on host reproduction, and 2) sex-based variation in the impact of Plasmodium on survival and reproduction. To this end, we leveraged a long-term dataset from a dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis carolinensis) population with a high prevalence of Plasmodium. Juvenile males had lower probability of Plasmodium infection than juvenile females, indicating either elevated resistance or mortality in young males before the juvenile stage. Second year females had a lower probability of infection than females of other age classes, which suggests elevated mortality in infected yearling females after their first breeding season. Model comparison did not identify a direct relationship between Plasmodium infection and adult return (a proxy of survival), yet surprisingly, females paired with infected males in the previous breeding season had a higher probability of return. There was no relationship between Plasmodium infection and juvenile return, but returners with relatively higher parasite loads as juveniles had shorter lifespans than those without juvenile infections. Among adults, Plasmodium infection did not predict fledging success or fledgling number. However, returning juncos with relatively heavier bodies and higher parasite loads as juveniles had an increased probability of breeding in their first adult year. Combined with the shorter lifespans observed in infected juveniles, this suggests a terminal investment strategy for juncos contracting Plasmodium early in life. Our results indicate that the impact of Plasmodium on host fitness likely varies by host age at first infection and may exacerbate physiologically stressful life stages.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

While they have distinct diagnostic criteria, MDD and PTSD share considerable comorbidity, overlapping behavioral symptoms, and common neurobiological pathways. However, not all individuals exposed to chronic or traumatic stress develop these disorders, highlighting the importance of resilience, the capacity to maintain psychological and physiological stability under stress. An emerging yet understudied concept is cross-resilience: the idea that resilience to one form of stress may confer protection against another. While animal models have effectively captured individual differences in stress responses, few have explored whether resilience generalizes across distinct stress modalities or differs by sex. We examined cross-resilience using two validated rodent models: chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and learned helplessness (LH). These paradigms model complementary aspects of stress vulnerability. We assessed how prior CSDS experience influenced subsequent responses to LH. We also evaluated the role of the noradrenergic system using wild-type and norepinephrine (NE)-deficient (VMAT2loxDBHcre KO) mice. Behavioral phenotyping was combined with molecular analyses in key brain regions involved in emotion, motivation, and fear processing: the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and amygdala (AMY). We focused on BDNF and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, known to mediate neuroplasticity and stress resilience. Our findings reveal sex-specific patterns of cross-resilience, with prior CSDS resilience predicting LH resilience in males but not females. Molecular results indicate distinct adaptations across brain regions and sexes, underscoring the biological complexity of resilience.

Extracellular matrix degradation and remodeling are key parts of the vascularization process; however, it is difficult to isolate the effects of degradability in both natural and synthetic matrix models. Naturally-derived matrices typically couple degradability to other material properties, whereas synthetic matrices rely on short peptide sequences to impart degradability, which typically exhibit substrate overlap to many proteases. Here, we present a method to independently and broadly tune 3D hydrogel degradation using crosslinkers with non-natural peptoid (N-substituted glycine) substitutions. Increased peptoid substitutions reduced hydrogel degradability to collagenases without altering hydrogel modulus, swelling ratio, or crosslinker length. Using this approach, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) encapsulated in more degradable hydrogels proliferated more, formed more vessels, exhibited higher metabolic activity, and secreted more extracellular matrix than HUVECs encapsulated in less degradable or non-degradable hydrogels. Interestingly, HUVECs encapsulated in the least degradable hydrogels secreted significantly higher matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) than HUVECs encapsulated in the most degradable hydrogels, suggesting higher MMP secretion to compensate for the reduced matrix degradability. Overall, this work highlights the importance of protease-mediated remodeling on vascularization and suggests that peptoid substitutions are effective for tuning hydrogel degradability for a variety of 3D cell applications.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Current reconstruction relies on harvesting rib cartilage, an invasive procedure associated with donor site morbidity and unnaturally stiff ears due to the use of hyaline cartilage. Tissue engineered auricles could overcome these drawbacks by providing patient-specific elastic cartilage without the need for rib harvest. Yet, key challenges such as fibrocartilage formation, inhomogeneous extracellular matrix formation and mechanical inferiority during ex vivo maturation remain, often leading to graft deformation and degradation in vivo. To address this gap, we integrated approaches maintaining the chondrogenic potential with growth factors, promoting elastic cartilage formation through stress-relaxing materials, and achieving homogeneous maturation by culturing grafts on an elevated bioreactor platform that enables uniform nutrient diffusion, using primary human auricular chondrocytes. Together these approaches resulted in the maturation of bioprinted auricular grafts that closely resemble native human auricular cartilage, demonstrated by the uniform distribution of elastin, glycosaminoglycans, and collagen II, and lack of collagen I. RNA sequencing revealed gene expression patterns consistent with the transition from fibrocartilage towards elastic cartilage. On a functional level, grafts achieved a compressive modulus of 1.1+/-0.03 MPa, matching that of native human auricular cartilage (1.0+/-0.1 MPa) and maintained their structural integrity for 6 weeks in a subcutaneous rat model, where they transitioned towards mature elastic fibers. These grafts represent the closest approximation of native elastic cartilage achieved ex vivo to date, bringing the field closer to a clinically viable, long-term therapy for children affected by microtia.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

The parametrization of these models critically depends on atomistic data describing the underlying molecular interactions. In this work, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and potential-of-mean-force (PMF) calculations to investigate the interaction landscape between RNA nucleotides and protein amino acids. We begin by characterizing nucleotide-nucleotide binding modes through canonical base-pairing analysis, observing notable agreement in the predictions from both AMBER03ws and CHARMM36 force fields. Further rationalization of different nucleotide-nucleotide interaction modes involves the calculation of PMFs for ribose-ribose, phosphate-phosphate, and RNA tertiary interactions such as G-quadruplex formation. We also examine the effect of salt concentration on these interactions, finding a reduction on electrostatic self-repulsion for phosphate-phosphate binding upon increasing the ionic strength. Extending our analysis to amino acids, we first benchmark the performance of both AMBER03ws and a99SB-disp force fields for describing pairwise amino acid interactions, and then we evaluate different nucleotide-amino acid binding profiles. Our findings reveal a subset of amino acids---Lys and Arg (positively charged), Asp and Glu (negatively charged), and Gln, Ser, and Asn (polar residues)---that consistently engage with the nitrogenous bases of different nucleotides. Such binding is primarily mediated by hydrogen bonding and, in some cases, cation-{pi} interactions. Furthermore, we identify strong {pi}-{pi} stacking interactions with aromatic residues and phosphate-Arg contacts as key contributors to condensate cohesion in RNA-protein condensates. Our comprehensive analysis provides a detailed library of nucleotide-amino acid interactions, offering quantitative insights to inform coarse-grained model parametrization and deepening our understanding of condensate self-assembly, nucleic acid recognition, and phase-separation regulation at submolecular scale.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

The extent of phosphorylation of the different sites leads to different cellular outcomes. HSPB5 forms polydisperse oligomers, where the NTR regions can either be exposed to the solvent or buried within the oligomer, forming internal contacts. We assessed the effect of single and triple phospho-mimicry on HSPB5 oligomeric properties.

Few studies have assessed whether spontaneous night-to-night variation in sleep associates with variation in brain function within an individual. How this compares to the between-individual variation in sleep and cognition and their associations also remains largely unknown. These questions are of particular interest in the context of ageing because both sleep and cognitive abilities are altered in ageing. Furthermore, older people have been reported to be less sensitive to sleep loss. Here we investigated the relationship between sleep and cognition by quantifying associations between intra-individual variation in sleep and cognition as well as associations between inter-individual variation in sleep and cognition in 35 cognitively intact older adults (70.8 {+/-} 4.9 years; mean {+/-} SD; 14 females) living in the community. Subjective and actigraphic sleep measures and daily digital assessments of cognition (nine cognitive tests; 19 variables) were obtained over a two-week period. The cognitive test battery probed a wide range of cognitive functions including reaction time, working memory, attention, and problem solving. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified four principal sleep components which were labelled Sleep Duration, Sleep Efficiency, Subjective Sleep Quality, and Nap-Effect. Mixed model analyses were conducted with mean and deviation-from-the-mean cognitive variables to quantify how inter-and intra-individual variation in sleep associated with inter and intra individual variation in cognition. Longer sleep duration was associated with faster reaction times in both the inter-and intra-individual analyses and with reduced errors in the inter-individual analyses. Higher sleep efficiency was associated with faster reaction times in both the intra-and inter-individual analyses. By contrast, aspects of cognition relating to learning, visual memory, verbal reasoning, and verbal fluency did not associate with sleep.

Several factors, such as soil pH, host genotype, geographic location, and other environmental variables, are reported to influence the preferential selection between BR or SR species within soybean root nodules. However, it remains unclear whether the age of the host plant at the time of inoculation affects preferential rhizobial selection. To investigate this, we inoculated soybean plants with different cell densities of BR and SR strains at three time points: at sowing (T0), two weeks after germination (T2), and four weeks after germination (T4). We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of root nodule and rhizosphere samples to assess the relative abundance of BR and SR in nodule and rhizosphere. We observed a clear shift in nodule occupancy that favored BR at the time of seed sowing (T0) but increasingly favored SR when plants were inoculated at T2 and T4 stages. Specifically, at T4, SR dominated in nodules across all treatments, representing 88-99% of total sequences, regardless of applied inoculum ratio. In contrast, a similar number of sequences for both strains were detected in the rhizosphere at the time of the final harvest. These results highlight host age as an important ecological driver in legume-rhizobium interactions and suggest that inoculation time strongly influences microsymbiont selection.

Although the antigenic formula 1,3,19:z27:- was formerly designated as serovar Simsbury, this name was later removed from the WKL scheme due to reports of interconvertibility between serovars Senftenberg and Simsbury. The H:z27 antigen is currently recognized as one of the R-phase H antigens of S. Senftenberg. To elucidate the genetic basis of H:z27 antigen expression in S.

These isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 185 and harbored a horizontally acquired chromosomal region containing the fljA, fljB, and pinR genes, which are predicted to encode a translational repressor of fliC mRNA, a phase 2 flagellin, and an invertase, respectively. A deletion mutant lacking this region expressed the H:g,s,t antigen instead of H:z27, as confirmed by serotyping and Western blot analysis. Phylogenetic analysis based on S.

As global temperatures rise, how species adapt and respond to thermal shifts is crucial for anticipating global patterns of biodiversity change. Land vertebrates can be divided into two major thermoregulatory strategies, endothermy and ectothermy. One might hypothesize that, given their reputation as being cold blooded, ectotherms are thermal generalists, capable of operating across a greater range of body temperatures than endotherms and exhibit greater plasticity and evolvability in body temperature. However, a wide variety of traits and ecologies could modulate responses of thermal physiology to environmental change. Here, we employ macroevolutionary models to estimate the rate of adaptation of thermal physiology across squamates, mammals, and birds in the context of their ecology, physiology, and changing climatic conditions and whether there are fundamental differences in how the three clades respond to their environments. We find stronger relationships between squamates body temperature and their environment than in birds and mammals, significant effects of diel activity (nocturnal and diurnal) on body temperature evolution in all clades, and no effect of aquatic or terrestrial habits and rumination on the evolution of body temperature in mammals. Most surprisingly, our findings suggest shared limits on the evolution of thermal physiology across ectothermic and endothermic groups that argue for universal constraints on the rate of evolution in thermal physiology while explaining disparate patterns of body temperature and niche evolution across groups.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate this lag imposes a hard fitness constraint, forcing the optimal strategy toward slower switching rates as lag duration increases and reducing maximum expansion speed. Contrasting with models focusing on irreversible mutations, we show reversible switching enhances resilience by allowing recovery from maladaptation, influencing specialist persistence boundaries. Spatial structure also generates emergent phenomena: we find clustering provides collective protection, enhancing the survival of disadvantaged phenotypes. Additionally, our simulations show that conditioning on lineage survival alone is sufficient to generate the apparent stagnancy of deleterious sectors reported experimentally, revealing this observational bias as a crucial factor when characterizing selection effects at expanding fronts.

We demonstrate this lag imposes a hard fitness constraint, forcing the optimal strategy toward slower switching rates as lag duration increases and reducing maximum expansion speed. Contrasting with models focusing on irreversible mutations, we show reversible switching enhances resilience by allowing recovery from maladaptation, influencing specialist persistence boundaries. Spatial structure also generates emergent phenomena: we find clustering provides collective protection, enhancing the survival of disadvantaged phenotypes. Additionally, our simulations show that conditioning on lineage survival alone is sufficient to generate the apparent stagnancy of deleterious sectors reported experimentally, revealing this observational bias as a crucial factor when characterizing selection effects at expanding fronts. This work integrates bet-hedging theory with adaptation costs and spatial dynamics, offering a quantitative framework for fitness at expanding fronts.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Shared selective pressures on network members and compensatory changes between members can drive their parallel evolutionary trajectories. Indeed, correlated evolutionary rates of amino acid sequence change have been observed for interacting reproductive proteins. But whether gene copy number changes also correlate has not been widely studied. Here, we investigated copy number variation (CNV) of genes in the Drosophila Sex Peptide Seminal Fluid Protein (Sfp) network. Previous research analyzed CNV of the Sfp Sex Peptide (SP) in Drosophila species. We focus on 9 other Sfps whose function is required to mediate the binding of SP to sperm in D. melanogaster which is required for persistence of female post-mating responses. To exhaustively annotate CNV of genes, we developed a computational pipeline pairing iterative protein queries to genome sequence searches with phylogenetic clustering to resolve homology relationships. We observed that the Sfp network genes are ancestral to Drosophila and that there were repeated duplications and losses of network members across the genus. We detect statistically significant correlations in gene duplication or loss events among network proteins, and show this can be used to identify new members of the network. We also investigated CNV of female-derived proteins that act downstream of the SP sperm-binding network to modulate SP function, these proteins showed no significant correlation of gene turnover events with SP or its network. Our results provide insight into how evolving reproductive genes tolerate duplication and loss, and how network relationships could constrain reproductive protein evolution.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

In breeding birds, nest defence behaviour is particularly important, as it directly influences reproductive success. However, the flexibility of this behaviour, and its links to environmental conditions and fitness, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the repeatability of flight initiation distance (FID), a proxy for nest defence behaviour, in Common gull (Larus canus) breeding pairs within a seabird colony. We assess how consistent individual differences in FID relate to nesting site selection and fitness-related traits. We find that FID is strongly repeatable at the nest level (R = 0.50), indicating consistent behavioural differences among breeding pairs. Moreover, bolder pairs tend to nest at greater heights and in areas with higher conspecific density compared to shier pairs. Finally, our results suggest that different behavioural types may achieve similar fitness outcomes by selecting nesting sites that match their behavioural types.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

We implemented a comprehensive pipeline to detect positive selection across genome-scale datasets and identified Onychomys-specific mutations in Nav1.3 (Scn3a), a sodium channel gene expressed in the central nervous system and the peripheral sensory system after nerve damage. We detected an Onychomys-specific tandem gene duplication of the Cblif gene, which encodes a glycoprotein crucial for vitamin B12 absorption.

We show that even though skeletal muscle myosins are located in the same tandem gene cluster across vertebrate species, repeated gene duplication-loss turnover has resulted in each major vertebrate group now having an independently evolved set of core skeletal muscle myosins. Despite these separate derivations of skeletal myosins, each major vertebrate group exhibits tissue-specific patterns of expression, includes diverse myosin molecular properties, and employs different myosins in extreme muscles.

We hypothesize that some distribution and persistence of PFAS in humans arises from a distributed network of lipid transfer proteins that collectively solubilize and transport these compounds. To support this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction between various PFAS and human sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2), a promiscuous, structurally distinct LBP with no previously reported binding with PFAS. Using a combination of screening, fluorescence displacement assays, protein structure prediction of PFAS-SCP2 complexes, and NMR experiments, we demonstrate for the first time that SCP2 is a PFAS-binding protein.

In order to achieve lasting benefit with these therapies, effective strategies for tackling the evolution of drug resistance are required. We have developed a preclinical model system to mimic the development of resistance to KRAS G12Ci inhibitors (G12Ci) such as adagrasib and RMC-4998. Treatment of tumors containing a minor subpopulation of resistant cancer cells with G12Ci leads to their rapid outgrowth to replace the drug-sensitive cells within a few weeks. However, when combined with therapies that, at least in part, target the immune response, such as SHP2 inhibitors or PD-1 blockade, drug-resistant cells can be eliminated, even by drug combinations that do not impact their growth in the absence of drug-sensitive cells. This bystander killing of drug-resistant cells when drug-sensitive cells are targeted is dependent on an intact adaptive immune system. Mechanistically, these combination therapies lead to profound remodelling of the tumor immune microenvironment, with influx of T cells recognizing a tumor associated antigen shared between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cancer cells. Promotion of immune-mediated bystander killing of drug-resistant cells may provide a paradigm for tackling the problem of drug resistance in cancer more broadly.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Use of the Collaborative Cross (CC) addresses the problem of limited genetic diversity inherent in models like B6C3F1. In previous work, blood Pb levels in panel of female CC lines exposed to high-dose (0.1%) lead acetate showed a strain dependent response. Four strains from the original study with varying Pb blood levels after exposure were selected to determine if strain and sex dependence was exhibited in a two-week acute exposure to Pb, but also to Cr or Cd exposure. To investigate genetic background influence on metal deposition, five animals of each sex from each strain were placed on an American diet for one week prior to dosing high- (0.1%) or low- (0.01%) dose Pb acetate, high- (0.1%) or low- (0.01%) sodium dichromate, or high- (0.1%) or low- (0.01%) cadmium chloride via drinking water ad libitum for 14-days, matching the standard short-term exposure of the National Toxicology Program. Body composition was measured before the start of dosing and prior to necropsy using EcoMRI. Blood Pb at necropsy from this study suggests the strain dependent trends observed in previous exposures is conserved for acute Pb exposure but with different trends for Cr and Cd indicating that even a small panel of strains will not suffice for estimating variation across all toxicants.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed an aerodynamically-optimized guinea pig housing system that models natural, airborne, animal-to-animal Mtb transmission under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment. Iterative engineering and particle transport experiments revealed that airflow is a critical determinant of transmission efficiency. Static housing and excessive unidirectional ventilation both eliminated transmission, whereas controlled, low-velocity airflow enabled aerosol particle retention and exposure of naive animals. Under these optimized conditions, recipient guinea pigs converted their tuberculin skin tests above a defined positive threshold, developed Mtb-specific antibody responses, and exhibited pulmonary inflammation consistent with infection. These findings demonstrate that flow rates govern natural transmission of Mtb and provide a reproducible small-animal model for studying bacterial, host, and environmental factors that drive infectious spread.

TTX produced a rapid, dose-dependent reduction of nocturnal IOP when applied during the dark phase but had no effect during the light phase. This hypotensive effect was unilateral, short-lived, and consistent with local sodium channel blockade of sympathetic efferents.

Emerging evidence shows that mitochondrial dynamics (i.e., fission and fusion) could be regulated by exercise. Yet, there are knowledge gaps on the following questions: (i) which upstream signals are necessary and sufficient to bias mitochondria toward fission versus fusion? (ii) How does cellular energy status and ROS partition control between DRP1 and MFN/OPA1? And (iii) which combinations of intensity and duration produce similar cytosolic signals but distinct mitochondrial remodeling? To address these gaps, we developed an integrative computational framework that connects exercise regimens to mitochondria fission-fusion machinery by linking blood-myofiber energetics in cytosol and mitochondria to skeletal muscle signaling network. The influence of three exercise regimen (i.e., sprint, resistance, and endurance) on mitochondrial fission and fusion was simulated. Classified qualitative validation of signaling network model against studies not used in developing the model achieved 80% accuracy. The model predicts regimen-specific dynamics starting with acute DRP1-driven fission during exercise followed by MFN1/2-OPA1-mediated re-fusion as energy stress declines, consistent with a cyclical triage-then-rebuild paradigm. Changes are most pronounced and sustained with endurance, sharp but brief with sprint, and minimal with resistance. Global sensitivity analysis identified AMPK/PGC[-&gt;]1MFN1/2 as dominant fusion drivers, ROS and AMPK[-&gt;]MFF/DRP1 as primary fission switches, and calcium-calmodulin, ERK, and LKB1/AMPK as shared regulators of fission and fusion. Our model also predicts that an endurance base, augmented with 1-2 weekly high intensity interval traning (HIIT)/ sprint interval training (SIT) sessions could maximize AMPK-ROS pulses and mitochondrial fission-fusion.

Prior slice electrophysiology studies on the capacity for LTP after stroke reported conflicting results. Slice preparation could have influenced the results by disrupting neuromodulatory processes altered after stroke. Therefore, whether LTP can be induced in the peri-infarct cortex remains to be elucidated. We investigated LTP in the peri-infarct cortex of anesthetized rats using a novel in vivo method that preserves local and long-range circuit dynamics. Methods: LTP, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity were assessed under urethane anaesthesia in 15 rats (11 with focal stroke to the primary motor cortex, and 4 sham operated controls). Rats were tested one or two weeks after stroke using a minimally perturbed in vivo LTP induction protocol validated in naive rats. Motor function was evaluated using the cylinder test at baseline and at one or two-weeks post stroke. Results: LTP in the peri-infarct cortex was supressed in the stroke group compared to sham controls. In addition, synaptic transmission was reduced for higher stimulation intensities, and short-term plasticity shifted from facilitation to depression, indicating impaired synaptic function at one- and two-weeks post-stroke. Behaviorally, the lesioned rats exhibited motor deficits at one week but showed full recovery by two weeks post-stroke. Conclusion: In recovering animals, both LTP and synaptic transmission are profoundly impaired in the peri-infarct cortex.

Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed substantial diversity, with strains spanning seven phylogroups and 28 sequence types. Capsule biosynthesis loci linked to invasive infections, such as K1, K2ab, and K5, were also detected. The DFEC pangenome comprised 18,263 gene clusters, indicating high genomic plasticity. The plasmid repertoire was also varied and contributed to the genomic diversity of the strains. Approximately 78% of isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR), with resistance to last-resort antibiotics such as colistin and carbapenems also observed. High frequencies of virulence factors involved in host cell adherence, iron metabolism, serum survival, as well as toxins and type 3 secretion system (T3SS) genes were also detected. In contrast, metabolic modelling showed conserved biochemical profiles. Clustering based on accessory metabolic functions did not mirror phylogeny, suggesting metabolic convergence among distinct lineages.

B.; Weisbecker, V.", "abstract": "Accounting for phylogenetic relatedness in the analysis of shape has become a common practice, deemed necessary to factor in the non-independence between species because of common ancestry. However, when adjusting error distributions to account for relatedness, the phylogenetic-generalised-least-squares (PGLS) test can obscure an important component of variation called conservative trait correlation (CTC). This is the amount of variation in a response variable that is both attributable to a predictor variable and phylogenetically structured. If CTC represents a large amount of correlated variation, true biological associations with strong phylogenetic signal (from unrepeated evolutionary events for example) might not be supported using a PGLS. We demonstrate this effect using geometric morphometric shape analysis on 370 crania from the speciose Australian rock-wallabies (genus Petrogale). In this clade, well-recognised allometric patterns such as scaling of the braincase (Hallers rule) and snout length (craniofacial evolutionary allometry) are supported using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but not PGLS, indicating that important between-species shape variation is lost. We then apply two methods capable of quantifying aspects of the missing variation: variation partitioning (VARPART), which estimates the proportion of variation shared between the predictor and phylogeny, and multi-response phylogenetic mixed models (MR-PMM), which identify the strength of correlation within the phylogenetic component of trait variance. Both methods show that CTC dominates the allometric shape variation in our sample, highlighting its importance in assessing phylogenetically informed models. We suggest approaches that can consider CTC become more widely used to better understand morphology and its predictors.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Many developmental genes are controlled by multiple, redundant enhancers, raising the question of how robust regulatory systems can be dismantled to permit phenotypic transitions. We show that the loss of larval trichomes in Drosophila sechellia resulted from the independent inactivation of four embryonic enhancers of the shavenbaby gene. Each enhancer was extinguished by a distinct mechanism: (1) a large deletion that removed essential sequences, (2) the loss of activator sites and gain of repressor sites, (3) the acquisition of a long-range silencer, and (4) the unmasking of pre-existing repression. Notably, three of these mechanisms relied on repression, pointing to repression as a rapid route for the evolutionary loss of robust regulatory elements. These results show that robustness in gene regulation does not prevent morphological change but instead provides multiple opportunities for mutations to reduce enhancer activity, giving selection many paths to reshape form.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Neuronal branching is essential for establishing complex neural circuits. Many axons and dendrites in the CNS branch, forming complex process arbors. Some of these branches are formed during initial outgrowth and often occur via bifurcation of the growth cones of the extending neuronal processes. However, others are formed de novo by branch extension from a previously existing neurite. This process is often referred to as collateral branching. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. We show that in C. elegans, collateral branching of the PLM neuron is mediated by an actin assembly process guided by T ransducer of CDC-42-Dependent Actin assembly-1 (TOCA-1). This scaffolding protein is recruited to the branching site at the time of branch formation. cdc-42 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor dock-11 are also required for branch formation. Biochemically, TOCA-1 has been demonstrated to recruit WASP-1 and activate the Arp2/3 complex to promote actin assembly. In vivo, both wsp-1 and the Arp2/3 complex mutants also disrupt branch formation. While loss of TOCA-1 disrupts branching, it does not influence anterior-posterior (AP) or dorsal-ventral (DV) positioning of the branch, in contrast to previously defined branching regulators. Our data support a model in which TOCA-1 acts downstream of AP and DV positioning factors, directly orchestrating filopodial extension to form the nascent branch.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Here we introduce VIDEO (Visual Integration of Drosophila Enhancer Organization), a web-based analysis tool that enables visualization of conserved TF binding motifs within proximal promoters of genes differentially expressed in specific tissues. Starting with gene lists derived from in situ hybridization, microarray, and/or scRNA-seq studies of WT or mutant samples, one can identify the TFs expressed in each tissue and learn if and where the consensus binding motifs for those TFs are found within the proximal enhancers of a custom gene set. This pipeline also allows for coincident visualization of active chromatin, as determined from ATAC-seq data, and for the visualization of DNA binding data from ChIP-seq datasets for specific TFs.

Bumblebees have distinct ecological pressures acting upon individuals at different times: young queens (gynes) and workers share similar challenges as they both forage as part of the colony, but only queens overwinter and start a colony the following season, switching to a reproductive stage once established in a (dark) colony. Past work shows that gynes are better at visual learning than workers, but we know little about this varies between a foraging (gyne) stage and reproductive (queen) stage. Here we compared bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) visual learning and brain morphology across age-matched naive workers and gynes, and older reproductive queens. We expected foraging-stage gynes to be better at visual learning than reproductive queens and visual regions to be reduced in the latter stage, in line with past work in other social insects. However, we found that gynes and queens performed similarly, while both performed better than workers. We also found that reproductive queens had larger olfactory regions (antennal lobes) than gynes, while visual regions (medulla and lobula) did not differ, indicating a greater investment in olfactory regions in the reproductive stage. Brain regions scaled differently across gynes and workers with body size, suggesting that gynes are not simply large workers in terms of their neuromorphology.

S.; Rokstad, H.; Velazquez, J.; Browne, S.; Edwards, A. G.; Kravets, V.", "abstract": "Pancreatic beta cells regulate circulating glucose levels by releasing insulin. Beta cells transduce elevated blood glucose into electrical activity through an intrinsic cascade of metabolic and electrophysiologic responses. These responses are synchronized across the electrically connected network of beta cells, such that insulin release is also relatively synchronous. Despite their coordinated behavior, individual beta cells exhibit significant functional heterogeneity. This heterogeneity is thought to provide cells with specific functional phenotypes the ability to control the activity of the broader network. Hub cells, identified by their synchronized [Ca2+] activity, are one such functional subpopulation, and are believed to orchestrate the second, oscillatory phase of insulin release. However, it remains unclear whether the cell-autonomous characteristics of hub cells, such as their metabolic activity and electrophysiologic properties, are more important than their network characteristics (i.e. gap junctional coupling) for their ability to influence broader network activity. In this study, we investigate the roles of intrinsic metabolic and electrophysiologic properties and ionic coupling in determining the beta hub cell phenotype. Using a computational islet model of 1,000 beta cells, our analysis revealed that both intrinsic metabolic properties and structural coupling via gap junctions are crucial for determining the hub cell phenotype. After investigating the intrinsic coupling conductance of neighboring cells and the number of structural (direct electrical) links as independent contributors to the hub cell's local electrical coupling, we find that the number of cells to which a beta cell is directly coupled may be a key determinant of its propensity to serve as a hub cell in the model. As predicted for this subpopulation, we also demonstrate that decoupling hub cells impairs the functional connectivity of the entire network. Our findings indicate the importance of both autonomous cellular dynamics and non-autonomous structural coupling for the hub cell phenotype. These insights help build a fundamental understanding of hub cells, which in turn may contribute to identifying potential approaches to preserve or improve beta cell function and thereby manage the progression of diabetes.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Existing technology platforms remain inaccessible for research due to restricted access to commercial organ perfusion devices, high costs of both devices and proprietary consumables, and steep technical learning curves. Additionally, the available technology is not optimized to perfuse smaller organs such as the kidney. Methods: To overcome these barriers, a custom NEVOP circuit was developed using recycled, repurposed, and low-cost components. Porcine kidneys and autologous blood were used to iteratively optimize circuit design. A porcine kidney autotransplantation protocol was adapted to evaluate in vivo kidney function after ex vivo perfusion. To pilot the flexibility of this system as a multi-organ platform for ex vivo human biology, non-transplantable human donor kidney, spleen, and pancreas specimens were stably perfused using human blood products and analyzed. Results: An ultra low-cost NEVOP system engineered to perfuse porcine kidneys and diverse human organs (kidney, pancreas, and spleen) sustained viable organs for up to 24 hours with evidence of both function and viability. Key innovations included a parallel flow resistor to facilitate low-flow perfusion in non-heparinized organs and a containment bag with adjustable magnets to provide vascular stability and recycling of venous overflow. The circuit costs less than 1,500USD to construct, and porcine kidneys perfused for 24 hours on this platform demonstrated healthy in vivo function upon autotransplantation. Conclusions: Custom NEVOP platforms constitute novel and potentially transformative research platforms which use low-cost and readily available materials.

To address this, this paper introduce DNACSE (DNA Contrastive Learning for Sequence Embeddings), an unsupervised noise contrastive learning framework designed to fine-tune the DNA language foundation model while enhancing the distribution of the embedding space. The results demonstrate that DNACSE outperforms direct usage of DNA language models in DNA barcoding-related tasks.

In addition, zero-shot benchmarking and genomic benchmarking tests are evaluated, indicating that DNACSE enhances the performance of DNA language models in generalized genomic tasks.

We then analyzed distributions of subpopulations from cells stimulated with insulin secretion signals known to induce biophysical remodeling and maturation. We found significant changes in each subpopulation studied in response to stimulation, consistent with the increases in maturation, crystallization, and changes in size reported in the literature.

However, sex differences in thyroid disease risk varies with age, e.g. although the risk of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer, increases with age for both sexes, age of diagnosis for most thyroid cancers is lower for females than males. In contrast, the risk of Hashimotos thyroiditis (HT), an autoimmune condition, is higher in ages 30-50 than older age groups, and females have a higher risk than males at any given age. These age- and sex-dependent variations suggest that thyroid aging is a sex-biased process, where gene regulatory patterns evolve with age differentially between sexes. Yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. To characterize sex-specific aging-related changes in gene regulation in healthy thyroid and disease, we constructed individual-specific gene regulatory networks using a two-step approach. First, we estimated gene-gene co-expression networks for each individual using BONOBO. Second, we integrated these networks with sex-specific transcription factor (TF) motif data and protein-protein interaction priors using PANDA to infer individual-level TF-driven gene regulatory networks. We found that within normal thyroid, regulatory patterns of cancer-related genes and biological pathways involved in cell proliferation, immune response, and metabolic processes vary by age in a nonlinear manner. However, the direction and rate of age-related changes differ between sexes. In females we detect two inflection points around ages 40 and 60, when the gene regulatory patterns in healthy thyroid show significant change for most pathways. This drastic change in gene regulatory networks is mostly driven by estrogen and androgen receptor TFs. To understand how aging-related changes in gene regulation drive risk of thyroid disorders, we investigated two diseases that have known sex- and age- specific differences: HT and ATC. We observed that in ATC, disease-relevant immune and metabolic pathways change with age in the same direction as they change in disease. In contrast, in HT, disease-related pathway targeting patterns are in the opposite direction of those in aging. Moreover, in age groups where HT is most diagnosed, TF-targeting patterns of disease-associated immune, metabolic and cell proliferation pathways in females were closer towards the disease state than in males, emphasizing the influence of sex-biased regulatory patterns in increasing thyroid disease risk in females. In thyroid tissue, genes related to immune response and metabolic processes, are regulated by TFs in an age- and sex-biased manner. These age- and sex-specific gene regulatory variations may contribute to the variation in risk of thyroid conditions with age and an overall higher risk of diseases in females compared to males, thus emphasizing the need for tailored screening and prevention strategies.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

These biosensors detected the correct localization and orientation of TOM20, TOM22, VDAC1, MICU1, ATP5F1C, OTC, and SIRT2/3 proteins in their respective subcompartments, as well as the translocation of BAX and Drp1 from the cytosol to mitochondria in intact cells. The localization sensors provide non-invasive tools to monitor protein localization and translocation to mitochondria in real-time with nanometer resolution in intact cells submitted to various stressors.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

The functions of this broad targeting remain unclear. Here, we uncovered a surprising role for the piRNA pathway in regulating the splicing and fidelity of nascent mRNAs induced during stress. Upon heat shock, piRNAs target essential heat-shock protein (hsp) RNAs, normally absent but massively upregulated upon stress, and generate abundant sequence-specific secondary RNAs (22G-RNAs) antisense to these transcripts. Instead of enforcing silencing, these 22G-RNAs associate with nascent hsp transcripts and RNA polymerase II at the transcription complex, delaying splicing and preserving a pool of pre-mRNAs for processing during recovery from stress. This role of the piRNA pathway in enforcing splicing delays, extends beyond hsps to alternatively spliced genes and ensures the proper expression of long-intron-containing genes in the genome. In piRNA-deficient prde-1 mutants, splicing is precocious, hsp pre-mRNAs are depleted, expression of long-genes is impaired, transcripts accumulate errors, and consequently, embryos become critically dependent on nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) for survival. Downregulating NMD components in piRNA-deficient animals results in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and embryonic lethality. Thus, by safeguarding splicing under stress, the piRNA pathway complements NMD as a mechanism of RNA quality control, linking RNA fidelity to genome surveillance.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we combine a synchronized cargo-release assay with a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to systematically map regulators of GPCR ER-to-PM transport. Focusing on the {delta}-opioid receptor (DOR), a prototypical class A GPCR, we identify CNIH1 as a dedicated export factor. In the absence of CNIH1, DOR is retained intracellularly with immature glycosylation, and drives reduced PM signaling. CNIH1 localizes to both ER exit sites and the Golgi, promoting the anterograde transport of a subset of class A GPCRs. Opioid receptors directly interact with CNIH1 and require its putative COPII-binding site for export. Distinct from other human cornichon homologs, CNIH1 defines a selective GPCR-sorting receptor that couples GPCR biosynthesis to signaling competence.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

This activity affects gene expression by allowing chromatin domains to be stably regulated and maintained.

Here we explore how long-range interactions facilitated by insulator pairing are affected by the presence of two specifically interacting partners. Our results show that when two partners are present, they compete, reducing each other's effects, suggesting that interactions tend to be limited to two interacting partners at any given time. In particular, when a distant transgenic copy of an eve insulator (homie or nhomie) is present, it can interact with either endogenous insulator. But when one endogenous insulator is removed, the remaining one interacts more strongly with the transgenic copy, biasing the induced enhancer-promoter interactions toward those nearest the remaining endogenous insulator. We also show that removing one or both endogenous eve insulators significantly reduces endogenous eve function at a critical early stage of development, and that the eve Polycomb domain expands in both directions when its insulator boundaries are removed.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Most known two-component lantibiotics are made up of a structurally conserved -lanthipeptide that binds to the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II and a {beta}-lanthipeptide that interacts with the -peptide-lipid II complex to disrupt the membrane of susceptible bacteria. A few two-component lantibiotics including roseocin produced by Streptomycetes do not follow this general scheme and act by different, currently unresolved mechanisms. An important first step in studying this latter group of lanthipeptides is determination of their chemical structure. Roseocin's {beta}-peptide (Ros{beta}) is formed by the RosM lanthipeptide synthetase from the RosA1 precursor peptide. RosM carries out nine dehydrations of Ser and Thr residues to the corresponding dehydroamino acids followed by six Michael-type additions of the thiols of Cys residues to a subset of the dehydroamino acids to form six thioether crosslinks. Sequence alignment with other structurally characterized lanthipeptides does not allow prediction of the ring pattern of Ros{beta}. In this study, Ros{beta} was produced in Escherichia coli and its ring pattern was established by multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The stereochemistry of the lanthionine and methyllanthionine residues was determined by Marfey's analysis with authentic standards.

Although plantar flexor fatigue is believed to be responsible for the proximal shift in mechanical work generation, this has yet to be confirmed experimentally. Purpose: To 1) determine the effect of plantar flexor fatigue on lower limb positive joint work during running and 2) determine the effect of running shoes on this relationship. Methods: Trained male runners (n = 12) were analyzed over two 30 s runs at their 10 km race pace, without and with local plantar flexor fatigue induced via a calf-raise protocol to a level commensurate with that accumulated over an exhaustive run (~24% reduction in peak torque). Both the unfatigued and fatigued runs were performed in a traditional shoe and in advanced footwear technology on an instrumented treadmill while three-dimensional motion capture and ground reaction force data were collected. Results: Plantar flexor fatigue led to a redistribution of joint work, with lower positive ankle work (p < 0.001), greater positive knee work (p = 0.001), and similar positive hip work (p = 0. 550) in the fatigued run as compared to the unfatigued run. The relative positive joint contributions shifted proximally with fatigue (ankle -4%, knee +3%); however, this shift was not influenced by shoe condition (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Plantar flexor fatigue contributes to the proximal redistribution of positive joint work during running. However, the adoption of a suboptimal gait strategy appears to occur regardless of whether a runner wears a traditional shoe or advanced running footwear technology.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

In these cell types we identified an uncharacterised member of this family, Mdfic2/Gm765, that shares the ability to physically bind to PIEZO1 and PIEZO2. MDFIC2 is selectively expressed in subsets of mechanosensitive neurons, including dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglia, and vagal sensory neurons. Like its paralogues, MDFIC2 alters PIEZO1/2 mechanosensitivity and inactivation kinetics, converting them into high-threshold slowly inactivating mechanoreceptors. Extensive cryo-EM reveals a conserved binding pocket for these auxiliary subunits in the pore modules of both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 mediated by the post-translationally modified distal C-termini of MyoD-family inhibitor proteins.

Whereas the contribution of peripheral nerves to neuropathic pain is well established, the influence of peripheral non-neuronal cells that interact with injured nerves has not been studied in depth. Keratinocytes, the primary cell type in the epidermis, play an important role in the initial processing of environmental mechanical and thermal stimuli under normal conditions. Here, we investigated the role of keratinocytes following traumatic peripheral nerve injury and determined that these cells contribute to injury-associated heightened sensation. We performed tibial spared nerve injury (tSNI) in mice that selectively express archaerhodopsin in keratinocytes to temporally reduce activity from these cells at various timepoints following injury. Brief (5 min) optogenetic inhibition completely reversed both the mechanical and cold hypersensitivity at acute (4 days) and throughout chronic (17 weeks) timepoints following tSNI. Keratinocytes isolated from the spared glabrous skin dermatome were sensitized to mechanical and cold stimuli and found to release factors that enhance activity of sensory neurons. Moreover, we found that keratinocyte phospholipase A2 (PLA2) driven activation of pannexin-1 is critical for the long term development of mechanical allodynia. This discovery indicates that keratinocytes contribute substantially to the mechanical and cold allodynia after traumatic nerve injury and suggest that keratinocytes may be a topical therapeutic target to alleviate the severe touch- and cold-evoked cutaneous pain following peripheral nerve injury.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

While numerous studies have investigated the impact of macronutrient type and quantity on microbiota using in vitro systems, animal models, and human participants, most of these studies focused primarily on microbial-community composition and lacked the functional information that can be gained from transcript-level analyses. In this exploratory analysis, we use metatranscriptomic data to gain a functional perspective on how dietary composition is associated with the gut microbiota and hypothesized implications for host physiology. Data were derived from a tightly controlled, randomized cross-over feeding study conducted in a metabolic ward, where participants consumed two isocaloric and eucaloric diets differing in food processing and fiber content: A Western Diet (WD) limited in fiber, resistant starch, and whole foods and a Microbiome Enhancer Diet (MBD) composed of fiber-rich, whole foods. Our prior findings showed that a WD lead to a resource-limited microbiota enriched in mucin-degrading bacteria that resorted to metabolizing host-derived organic material, while the MBD supported a resource-replete microbiota that primarily metabolized dietary fiber. The objective of this work was to explore these findings more deeply using bioinformatic analyses of metatranscriptomic data. Our analysis showed increased transcription of fiber-degrading enzymes in the MBD and mucin-degrading enzymes in the WD. While in this analysis functional diversity of the gut microbiome was not affected, differences in resistant-starch and fiber content shifted the types of metabolic processes being actively transcribed. The MBD promoted biosynthetic and carbohydrate-fermenting pathways, while the WD was characterized by enzymes for host-glycan and protein degradation. Furthermore, the MBD-supported ecosystem benefits host health via enhanced SCFA production and reduced reliance on host glycan degradation. The WD fostered increased mucin and protein breakdown pathways that yield metabolites that may harm the gut barrier and systemic metabolism.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

This study investigated rhizosphere microbiome contributions to WCR resistance across the domestication gradient. We screened 23 accessions (15 wild teosinte accessions, 6 ancestral maize accessions, 2 modern maize accessions) for WCR resistance and analyzed rhizosphere microbiomes of selected resistant and susceptible accessions using Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Resistant accessions retained >80% of root structure (85.4%) while supporting minimal larval survival (22.5%) compared to susceptible accessions (46.7% root retention, 78.6% larval survival; P < 0.001). Resistant accessions recruited significantly more diverse bacterial communities under WCR pressure, with 28-31 enriched species versus 7-19 in susceptible accessions. Key enriched taxa included Pseudomonas putida (3.0-3.2-fold), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2.7-2.9-fold), and Bacillus subtilis, all possessing documented insecticidal properties.

Senescent cells did not reach a steady state but instead exhibited sustained, unbounded growth over a 12 day period, marked by a continuous rise in dry mass and volume coupled with declining mass density. Time resolved proteomics revealed extensive and asynchronous remodeling across organelles, with lysosomal, ER, and Golgi proteins increasing in abundance, whereas nuclear and mitochondrial proteins declined, indicating large scale reorganization of cellular composition. Phosphoproteomic inference linked these structural shifts to regulatory signaling, confirming the expected downregulation of CDK activity while revealing coordinated activation of stress and DNA damage responsive kinases such as CAMK2D, DNAPK, and MARK family members.

The DNA Damage Response (DDR) safeguards the genome from genotoxic stress through a coordinated system of sensors, relay proteins, and repair mechanisms. Since DNA repair is an energy-intensive activity, the process is tightly regulated and coordinated with various metabolic pathways. The nutrient-sensing insulin/IGF signalling (IIS) pathway has been extensively studied for its role in ageing and lifespan regulation in C. elegans through its downstream FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. However, there is limited understanding of its involvement in maintaining genomic integrity through the regulation of the DDR. In this study, we demonstrate the role of DAF-16/FOXO in preserving genome integrity by activating the expression of DDR repair genes in C. elegans. Activated DAF-16/FOXO directly binds to the promoter of DDR genes under conditions of low IIS, ensuring that their expression is maintained at a higher level, which is crucial for prompt DNA damage repair. Interestingly, we find that DAF-16 functions both cell autonomously as well as non-autonomously to support DNA integrity. We also determine that the DAF-16(d/f) isoform, but not the DAF-16(a) isoform, is essential for maintaining germline genome integrity. Furthermore, DAF-16 activation enhances the DDR primarily through the canonical DDR components and, to a lesser extent, via apoptosis-mediated clearance of damaged cells.

However, how macrophages regulate those receptors in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli is not completely understood. Endocytic membrane trafficking involving receptor internalization, followed by endosomal transport and recycling of the internalized receptors, plays essential roles in balancing cell-surface receptors to meet cellular needs. Here, we explored the role of the endocytic regulator EHD1 in immune responses in macrophages and determined its contribution to atherosclerosis progression. Methods EHD1 expression profiles in mouse and human plaques were determined by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunofluorescence staining. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) by transplanting bone marrow cells from Ehd1-/- or littermate wild-type mice to irradiated Ldlr-/- mice was performed to determine the effect of EHD1 deletion on atherosclerosis progression. In vitro mechanistic studies including inflammation signaling and endocytosis assays were performed in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Results EHD1 expression in macrophages is enhanced as atherosclerosis progresses in both mice and humans. Histological analysis of aortic root sections from BMT mice showed that EHD1 deletion reduces lesion size. ScRNA-seq of aortic CD45+ cells demonstrated that EHD1 deletion attenuates pro-inflammatory responses and cell-cell interactions. Mechanistic studies revealed that EHD1 accelerates the endocytic recycling of TNFR2 and activates NF-kB, leading to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, EHD1 interacts with retromer and stabilizes sortilin, a retrograde cargo of retromer and a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Conclusions EHD1 promotes inflammation by enhancing TNFR2-NF-kB signaling and stabilizing sortilin, leading to accelerated atherosclerosis.

Here, we introduce a method to impute missing values of relative protein abundance by leveraging measurements from other proteins in the dataset through regularized regression. Our technique, which is applicable to diverse datasets including different cell lines, animals, or biochemical perturbations, capitalizes on the hitherto overlooked biological covariation among protein abundance changes. Our analysis of eight published proteomics datasets reveals a robust imputation capability, achieving a median R2 of 0.55 to 0.8 between imputed and measured data. We demonstrate a similar imputation efficacy in multiple measurement modalities: TMT, DIA, label free, and TMT phosphoproteomics. When examining regression coefficients that were pivotal for accurate data imputation we found that those often mirror known biology. We propose that previously overlooked biological covariation might lead to the generation of novel hypotheses and ultimately advance our understanding of systems level protein organization.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Changes in biochemical properties, caused by iterative mutations in amino acid sequence, underlie the alterations in protein function over time that underpin the evolutionary process. An example is the switching of an enzyme's reliance from one essential metal to an alternative as their catalytic cofactor. We previously described such a neofunctionalisation in Staphylococcus aureus, which altered a superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme from being an ancestral manganese-dependent (MnSOD) into an extant isozyme that can equally utilise either manganese or iron, termed cambialism (camSOD). Yet it's unclear whether camSOD emergence involved selection solely for cofactor flexibility or whether other biochemical properties also diverged during neofunctionalisation. Here, we have investigated an independent biochemical property of the S. aureus SODs, their structural stability. We demonstrate that the neofunctionalised camSOD exhibits increased stability relative to the ancestral MnSOD. S. aureus camSOD is more resistant to both chemical and thermal unfolding in vitro. Crucially, while both isozymes possess a stable 'core' at the heart of their fold, consisting of regions of the protein localised around the metal cofactor that resist hydrogen-deuterium exchange when exposed to isotopically labelled solvent, this core is larger and more exchange-resistant in camSOD than MnSOD. Thus, during the recent divergence of this SOD pair, two distinct biochemical properties have undergone substantial and rapid evolutionary change. This study paves the way for investigations of the structural and functional relationship between these properties, a SODs metal-preference and stability, and of how these properties were concomitantly selected during neofunctionalisation in the S. aureus lineage.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

P97 utilizes various cofactors to process different substrates. For unfolding of proteins that are modified with K48-linked ubiquitin chains, p97 works with the heterodimeric cofactor Ufd1-Npl4, and the cofactor Faf1 was shown to enhance this activity in the context of replisome disassembly, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we employ an in vitro reconstituted system with human components for biochemical experiments, mutational studies, FRET-based assays, and cryo-EM structure determination to reveal that Faf1 plays a generic role in accelerating ubiquitin-dependent substrate processing by promoting the unfolding of an initiator ubiquitin and its engagement by the ATPase motor. Faf1 thereby uses its p97-bound C-terminal UBX domain to anchor a long helix that braces the UT3 domain of Ufd1 and apparently stabilizes the Ufd1-Npl4 cofactor for ubiquitin unfolding. Our findings demonstrate how p97 works simultaneously with several cofactors to facilitate the unfolding of ubiquitinated proteins, indicating more complex regulatory mechanisms for substrate selection than for the simpler Cdc48 ortholog in yeast.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Although cuticle biosynthesis is dynamically regulated by environmental cues, the molecular mechanisms integrating these external signals with intracellular responses remain largely unknown. Here, we discovered that cuticle biosynthesis is precisely orchestrated by two distinct regulatory modules acting in synchrony with the diel cycle. Daylight is perceived by phytochrome B (phyB), which suppresses cuticular wax biosynthesis by degradation of PIF4, a phytochrome-interacting bHLH factor that activates wax biosynthetic genes. This suppression is alleviated when phyB itself is degraded by the E3 ubiquitin ligase LRB, leading to diurnal activation of PIF4. In contrast, loss-of-function and transcriptional assays of CFLAP1 demonstrated its direct negative role in cutin biosynthesis. At night, the E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 mediates proteasomal degradation of CFLAP1, thereby promoting cutin accumulation via activation of BDG1. Together, these results reveal that two regulatory modules, LRB-phyB-PIF4 and COP1-CFLAP1 coordinate the diel regulation of cuticle formation, ensuring timely assembly of the protective barrier.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Despite advances in immunotherapy for other cancers, GBM remains refractory, potentially due to its lactate-rich, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While aerobic glycolysis-driven lactate accumulation is known to acidify the TME and impair immune function, the precise mechanisms linking lactate metabolism to immune evasion in GBM remain elusive. Methods: We integrated multi-omics analyses with machine learning to identify - gene signatures associated lactate metabolism (LM) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Multiple bioinformatic tools were employed to determine the association of key genes with TME remodeling, immunotherapy response and drug sensitivities. Results: Neuromedin B (NMB) emerged as a pivotal regulator of lactate-mediated immunosuppression, correlating strongly with LM and TIDE. We found that NMB expression was remarkably correlated with clinical characteristics, immune response, TME remodeling and drug sensitivities. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that NMB is a key cross-factor in metabolic and immune regulation in GBM. It breaks through the traditional perception that metabolism and immunity are mutually exclusive in cancer by promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism and enhancing anti-tumor immunity through its dual functions. It provides a new direction for the combined intervention of metabolic targeting and immunotherapy, and the strong predictive value of NMB expression for drug response further highlights its clinical application potential in the formulation of personalized treatment strategies for GBM patients.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Systematic conservation planning (SCP) offers a strategic framework to meet this challenge by prioritizing areas that promote species persistence and ecological resilience. Traditionally, SCP focuses on conserving adequate amounts of species' distributions to ensure their long-term persistence. More recently, partitioning species' distributions into bioclimatic components has emerged to explicitly represent niche variability, enhancing adaptive capacity by preserving local adaptations and genetic diversity across environmental gradients. Despite this conceptual progress, empirical comparisons of species-level and bioclimatic component prioritization remain scarce. This study aimed to compare species-level and bioclimatic component prioritization by assessing their trade-offs and effectiveness in supporting species persistence and ecological resilience. Specifically, we aimed to (i) assess the surrogacy between species-level and bioclimatic component prioritizations, (ii) examine their spatial overlap and divergence, and (iii) quantify and compare environmental heterogeneity within priority areas identified by each approach. We found that species-level and bioclimatic component prioritizations act as reasonable surrogates for one another overall, but species-level prioritization tended to underrepresent the least-covered bioclimatic components, with failures to capture certain components in the top-ranked areas. Spatial overlap between the two approaches was generally high, though it declined with more restrictive thresholds and under future conditions. Additionally, bioclimatic component prioritizations consistently captured higher within-group multivariate dispersion in environmental heterogeneity in selected areas. Our findings highlight that bioclimatic component prioritization captures greater environmental heterogeneity and complements species-based approaches by better representing niche diversity. Integrating both strategies may offer a more robust path toward climate-resilient conservation planning that accounts for ecological requirements and environmental variation.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

RTKs can adopt various DFGout conformations, but only the classical ones with a fully formed back pocket are structurally validated to accommodate type II inhibitors. However, such classical DFGout conformations are scarce, presenting a significant obstacle for selective RTK inhibitor design. Recently, a conserved disordered motif N-terminal to the kinase domain of RTKs, called the juxtamembrane (JM) motif, has been reported to regulate inhibitor binding to the DFGout conformation of VEGFR2, an RTK involved in angiogenesis. In this study, we performed extensive MD simulations to explore the impact of the disordered JM motif on the conformational space of the DFG motif in RTKs and its relationship to inhibitor binding at the active site of VEGFR2. We revealed that in VEGFR2, the disordered JM is highly dynamic and forms transient contacts with the kinase domain, and consequently fine-tunes the DFGout sub-conformational space to shift populations from non-classical to classical DFGout conformations. This dynamic model provides the structural basis underpinning the reported regulatory effects of JM on inhibitor binding toward VEGFR2. Addtionally, we demonstrated that in other RTKs beyond VEGFR2, the disordered JM similarly promotes classical DFGout conformations. Such role of JM is particularly favorable for creating druggable DFGout conformations that can be exploited for designing high-selectivity type II inhibitors.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Different small molecule inhibitors (SMI) have been designed to inhibit signalling proteins in oncogenic driver pathways in GBM. However, SMIs have been unsuccessful in improving patient outcomes. Here, we investigate whether crosstalk between signalling pathways and signalling pathway redundancy are responsible for single-agent resistance using a primary patient-derived glioblastoma organoid (PGO) platform.

This work aims to facilitate the selection of software tools for Boolean modelling of signal transduction and gene regulatory networks by developing benchmark and evaluation criteria and applying them to the available tools. Twenty Boolean modelling tools were identified, which were assessed on their compliance to ten FAIR4RS (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability for Research Software) aspects. Additionally, usability was assessed using a set of 25 developed sub-criteria. Furthermore, the functionalities were analysed, validated and the tools abilities to simulate and analyse Boolean models of different sizes were benchmarked. The evaluation demonstrated that, whilst the results produced by the 20 tools were completely consistent, their analytical functionalities and capabilities to simulate larger models varied widely. Size constraints for tools functionalities ranged between 25 and more than 10,000 nodes. Each tool only covered part of the available functionalities, and many exhibited deficiencies in FAIR4RS compliance and usability.

N.; Luxenburger, A.; Harris, L. D.; Johnson, J. R.; Almo, S. C.; Herold, B. C.", "abstract": "Studies of herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry uncovered a previously unappreciated \"outside-in\" signaling pathway whereby activation of the calcium (Ca2+) responsive enzyme phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1), which is known to trigger the bidirectional movement of phosphatidylserines (PS) between the inner and outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, also induces the translocation and subsequent extracellular activation of intracellular proteins, including Akt. We hypothesized that HIV-1, which has been shown to elicit scramblase TMEM16F-mediated PS externalization, may trigger a similar \"outside-in\" signaling cascade involving exofacial kinase activity to promote its entry into CD4+ T cells. To study this process, we utilized a cell impermeable staurosporine analogue, alkyl-CIMSS, which is a broadly active kinase inhibitor that blocks HSV-induced exofacial Akt phosphorylation and HSV infection. Using multiple cell types including TZM-bl, Jurkat T cells, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we show that, in contrast to the effects on HSV, treatment of cells with alkyl-CIMSS enhances HIV-1 infection post-entry that is not dependent on TMEM16F. To identify potential biological processes that are responsive to alkyl-CIMSS, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing and whole cell proteomics and found that alkyl-CIMSS treatment of cells robustly upregulates the cell surface density of the proteoglycan glypican-1 (GPC1). Lentiviral delivery of GPC1 overexpression and shRNA knockdown constructs reveal that the presence and absence of GPC1 independently of alkyl-CIMSS treatment significantly impact HIV-1 infection, with the effect on infection corresponding to GPC1 expression. Further, we demonstrate that the influence of GPC1 on HIV-1 infection is in part mediated by TGF-{beta} signaling. Collectively, these findings implicate a cell surface protein susceptible to alkyl-CIMSS in restricting HIV-1 infection and identify GPC1 as a novel modulator of HIV-1 infection.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Viral vRNPs comprise genomic RNA encapsidated by nucleoprotein N and associated with the polymerase complex (L, P, and M2-1). It was previously demonstrated that newly synthesized vRNPs are transported along microtubules by hijacking Rab11a, a small GTPase involved in the regulation of recycling endosomes. In our previous study, we showed an interaction between Rab11a and vRNPs in infected cells by immunoprecipitation assays, nevertheless the molecular mechanisms underlying Rab11a viral hijacking remained unknown. Here, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of the interaction between RSV vRNPs and Rab11a using immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence colocalization, GST pull-down assays, and biolayer interferometry. We demonstrate that the viral polymerase L is the sole vRNPs component responsible for Rab11a recognition: immunoprecipitation of L specifically co-precipitates HA-tagged Rab11a, whereas other vRNPs proteins show no interaction. In vitro binding studies confirm that L interacts directly and specifically with the active, GTP-bound form of Rab11a with sub-micromolar affinity. Domain mapping using truncated constructs reveals that this interaction requires the C-terminal methyltransferase and CTD domains of L (residues 1756-2165) and depends on Rab11a's Switch I region, known to mediate interactions with cellular Rab11a partners. Mutagenesis further highlights leucine 1860 in the L polymerase as critical for Rab11a binding. Competitive inhibition of Rab11a-L interaction using the minimal Rab11a-binding domain reveals its involvement in vRNPs transport as it significantly impairs vRNP dynamics during infection. Together, these findings establish RSV polymerase L as the key mediator of Rab11a engagement, define the molecular interface of their interaction, and reveal a potentially conserved viral strategy for genome transport. Targeting the L-Rab11a interaction could therefore be a promising strategy for the development of RSV-specific or broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

However, empirical evidence for consistent biodiversity-structure relationships across taxa is still limited. We investigated whether structurally more complex forests support greater species richness and higher multidiversity across taxonomic and functional groups in 19 mature forest plots in Flanders, Belgium. As one of the most densely populated and urbanized regions in Europe, with limited and highly fragmented forest cover, Flanders provides a particularly informative and policy-relevant context to test structure-biodiversity relationships. Its forests, often dominated by a few tree species and subject to long-term anthropogenic pressures and management, represent a realistic gradient of structural complexity. Structural complexity was quantified using a Structural Complexity Index (SCI), and biodiversity was assessed using a multidiversity index integrating scaled species richness across five taxonomic and seven arthropod functional groups. Using mixed-effects models and multivariate Bayesian analyses, we tested both direct effects of SCI on biodiversity and the covariation in species richness among groups. Contrary to expectations, SCI was not a consistent predictor of multidiversity, and most groups showed weak or inconsistent responses. These findings might suggest that structural complexity alone may be insufficient to enhance biodiversity in simplified forests.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

To date, no effective treatment is available for this debilitating condition. Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction, including oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) failure, accumulates within OA chondrocytes and may contribute to pathogenesis. In this context, mitochondrial dysfunction may be associated with observable changes in mitochondrial number, size and shape. However, a comprehensive characterization of mitochondria-related features during OA, from tissue to cell level, is still lacking. Addressing these gaps could inform therapeutic strategies, such as the partial restoration of OxPhos, which has been proposed as a therapeutic approach. Methods: Here, we employed a multimodal approach that included Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and real-time cellular metabolic assays (Seahorse technology) to better characterize mitochondrial parameters in cartilage during OA. Two types of experimental models were used using human cartilage: (1) undamaged versus damaged OA zones, and (2) non-OA versus OA samples. In addition, we investigated the potential of repurposing bezafibrate, an approved peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, as a mitochondria-based therapy to restore OxPhos in OA chondrocytes. Results: We identified that OA chondrocytes exhibit a decrease in glycogen deposits surface, and an increased number of mitochondria alongside an OxPhos dysfunction compared to non-OA chondrocytes. A similar trend toward glycogen storage deficiency and increased mitochondria number was observed in OA chondrocytes from damaged cartilage areas. Furthermore, multivariate analyses revealed that the clinical profiles of OA patients allowed OA chondrocytes to be separated into responders and non-responders to bezafibrate. Conclusion: We provide evidence that OA chondrocytes display decreased glycogen deposits surface, increased mitochondrial number and OxPhos dysfunction. Additionally, we identified that bezafibrate, a PPAR agonist, improved OxPhos function in a subgroup of OA chondrocytes derived from patients.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

The exocyst complex, especially the EXO70 subunit, has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in vesicle trafficking and plant immune responses in model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the function and evolution of EXO70 genes in fruit crops remain largely unexplored. Results: We conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the EXO70 gene family across five Actinidia species using Arabidopsis EXO70 sequences as queries. A total of 217 EXO70 genes (23 to 54 paralogues per species) were identified and classified into three subfamilies and nine clades (EXO70A-EXO70I), consistent with previous classifications in other plant taxa. Phylogenetic reconstruction and microsynteny analyzes revealed lineage- and genus-specific expansions of EXO70C members, as well as species-specific expansion events, particularly within the EXO70E and EXO70H clades. To investigate potential immune functions, yeast two-hybrid and in planta co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that kiwifruit EXO70B1 physically interacts with the immune hub protein kiwifruit RIN4_1. These interactions support conservation of the EXO70-RIN4 module in plant immunity. Conclusions: This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the EXO70 gene family across multiple kiwifruit species and uncovers candidate genes potentially involved in plant immunity through RIN4-mediated defense signaling. Notably, the expansion and diversification of the EXO70E and EXO70H clades suggest possible adaptive evolution within these clades and neofunctionalization. These findings provide valuable genomic resources and novel insights into the evolution of vesicle trafficking components in fruit crops, laying the groundwork for future efforts to enhance disease resistance in kiwifruit through breeding or biotechnological approaches.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Despite their widespread adoption, biological parts are complex and when used in a new molecular context can result in unexpected outcomes. Site-specific recombinases have been widely used due to their unique ability to induce precise, irreversible changes to a DNA sequence, making them ideal tools for memory logic operations. However, unexpected context-specific failures of even the most widely used recombinase, Cre, has limited the expansion and complexity of synthetic gene circuits in diverse species. Here, through a systematic analysis of Cre failure in plant gene circuits, we uncovered multiple unexpected post-recombination interactions within the transcriptional unit between the promoter region, recombinase, and their cognate recognition sites. These significantly inhibit transcriptional activity, preventing circuit functionality. Specifically, post-recombination Cre recombinase exhibits an inhibitory property by binding to lox sites, with the remaining lox site repressing transcription. By thoroughly characterizing these dynamics, we restored Cre functionality and expanded the plant-based recombinase toolkit for Cre-related recombinases, developing combinations of recombinases and cognate sites with different activation levels for constructing logic gates with stable memory functions. We further developed multiple functional split-recombinase systems for simultaneous logic using a range of dimerization domains and constructed complex logic gates, including 3-input and 6-input AND gates. Together, this exploration of component context dependency in genetic circuits, even with commonly used parts like the Cre/lox system, has implications extending beyond plant systems, and significantly expands plant memory circuit capabilities.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

We discovered that the host peptidylprolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (PPIA/CypA), was essential for the formation of the R. parkeri actin tails that enable pathogen motility. PPIA localized to actin-associated bacterial poles and directly interacted with Sca2, the R. parkeri surface-exposed autotransporter chiefly responsible for actin tail nucleation. Sca2 bound PPIA through a domain implicated in surface translocation, and Sca2 failed to reach the R. parkeri surface in PPIA-deficient host cells.

Expression analysis revealed condition-specific regulation of two of those pairs, spRNA23/asRNA93 and spRNA24/asRNA94, under oxidative, temperature, and osmotic stress. Overexpression of the corresponding small proteins, sP23 and sP24, revealed distinct physiological effects: both enhanced growth under high-salt conditions, while sP24 in addition supported cell size maintenance during osmotic stress, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Consistently, overexpression of asRNA94 let to impaired growth under salt stress, suggesting its negative regulatory role towards sP24.

However, the structural and functional mechanisms of nairovirus ENs remain poorly understood. Here, we describe biochemical and structural studies of the ENs from CCHFV and KASV. Biochemical assays demonstrate that the RNA endonuclease activity of both ENs is activated by manganese ions and exhibits a preference for uridine-rich RNA substrates. This activity is inhibited by three metal-chelating inhibitors (DPBA, L-742,001, and BXA), with BXA displaying the highest binding affinity and inhibitory potency. We further determine nine crystal structures of CCHFV and KASV ENs in apo, metal ion-bound, and inhibitor-bound states. Comparative structural analysis uncovers a two-metal-ion binding mode unique to nairovirus ENs, in which conserved residues coordinate two manganese ions via bridging water molecules. In the inhibitor-bound structures of KASV EN, BXA forms additional stabilizing interactions with the enzyme, explaining its superior inhibitory effect. Functional assays further confirm that the two-metal-ion mechanism is critical for viral transcription.

Here, we combine structural biology with in vivo approaches to show that Rhs2 from Serratia marcescens Db10 is a dual-kingdom T6SS-dependent DNase effector which hijacks distinct, essential target cell functions in order to reach its site of action in bacterial and fungal cells. In bacterial cells, the Rhs2 toxin domain (Rhs2CT) interacts specifically with the elongation factor, EF-Tu, and, in sibling cells, interacts with the cognate immunity protein in an unusual manner. Interaction with EF-Tu is essential for T6SS-mediated intoxication of bacterial cells by Rhs2, but not for DNase activity or intoxication of fungal cells, implying it facilitates entry of Rhs2CT across the inner membrane to the cytoplasm. Alternatively, in fungal cells, Rhs2CT translocates to the nucleus using the nuclear import machinery.

To circumvent ESX-5 essentiality, we made an M. tuberculosis strain in which the central ESX-5 membrane component EccD5 can be conditionally depleted. Here, we use this strain to demonstrate that M. tuberculosis requires the ESX-5 secretion system to grow using specific carbon sources in vitro, to grow in cultured macrophages, and to replicate and disseminate in aerosol-infected mice. M. tuberculosis requires ESX-5 to use glycerol or glucose as the sole carbon source. Use of glycerol and glucose also depends on the outer membrane protein PPE51. We show that M. tuberculosis requires ESX-5 activity for outer membrane export and surface exposure of PPE51. Expression of the outer membrane porin MspA enabled growth of ESX-5 deficient M. tuberculosis on glycerol, suggesting that the main function of ESX-5 in vitro is to export nutrient transporters to the outer membrane.

Lineage tracing using Myh11CreERT2;ROSA26-EGFP mice confirmed that osteochondrogenic cells originated from contractile VSMCs. scRNA-seq confirmed osteochondrogenic transdifferentiation of VSMCs and highlighted dynamic changes in surrounding cells involved in calcification-related and inflammatory processes. Conclusion The OTAC method enabled a comprehensive understanding of the microenvironmental dynamics during MAC progression at the single-cell level. This powerful model provides a robust platform for future therapeutic intervention research.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Considerable progress has been made in understanding the drivers of variation in vital rates. However, the question of whether interactions are highly plastic and context-dependent, or strongly constrained by internal (e.g., species traits and composition) and/or external factors (e.g., environmental conditions) remains unclear. We applied a theoretical approach based on the feasibility domain - the range of conditions allowing coexistence - to a nine-year dataset of time-changing interactions between annual plants under large variability in annual precipitation. Using subcommunities of three species, we found that species interactions are strongly constrained, forming a ``core-periphery'' structure of consistently feasible combinations across years. This main finding means that species sample repeatedly a restricted range of opportunities for coexistence. Similar findings were obtained for subcommunities of four species. Crucially, the constraints to variation in biotic interactions are determined by species identity (internal constraints) rather than precipitation or temporal autocorrelation (external environmental factors). Furthermore, we found a contrasting effect of precipitation on the feasibility of subcommunities. While wetter years increase similarity between subcommunities and reduce the overall feasible range, drier years increase dissimilarity between subcommunities and increase the probability of coexistence when the conditions seem harsher. These findings suggest that constraints to biotic interactions tend to be alike across species in wetter years, but more context dependency occurs across species in drier years. Our findings challenge the assumption of highly plastic species interactions even in a highly dynamic system of annual plants. Our results also highlight the critical importance of internal constraints generated by species identity in mediating community persistence and predicting community responses to environmental change.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of the expanded CCTG RNA may produce two tetrapeptide repeat proteins (TPRs), poly-QAGR and poly-PACL, whose roles in DM2 pathogenesis remain poorly understood. To investigate their individual contributions, we expressed codon-optimized QAGR and PACL peptides with ATG start codon in Drosophila melanogaster. Expression of QAGR and PACL TPRs significantly compromised fly viability and lifespan, induces eye degeneration and locomotor defects. We found that QAGR accumulated in the nucleolus, disrupted nucleolar integrity, and compromised rRNA processing. Moreover, QAGR expression interfered with autophagy, leading to the accumulation of Atg8a- and Ref(2)P-positive aggregates. Genetic interaction studies showed that overexpression of Atg8a or Ref(2)P mitigated QAGR-induced eye-toxicity, while knockdown of autophagy genes exacerbated it. Conversely, PACL repeats promoted stress granule formation, as indicated by their colocalization with TIAR in human cells and their epistatic interaction with the Drosophila orthologue Rox8. Notably, cytoplasmic PACL aggregates were observed in myoblasts of DM2 patient. Together these findings demonstrate that QAGR and PACL peptides exert distinct toxic effects, impairing nucleolar function and autophagy, or altering stress granule dynamics, respectively. Both mechanisms likely converge to drive DM2 pathogenesis and represent promising therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

The pUG fold directs the amplification of RNAi in C. elegans, and pUG sequences are abundant in eukaryotic transcriptomes. Here, we report the sequence and ionic requirements for pUG folding. The pUG fold requires 12 guanosines but has an otherwise flexible sequence requirement. The uridines can be substituted with other nucleotides, with some sequence variants folding better than pUG RNA. The GA repeat sequence (GA)12 also forms a pUG-like fold, albeit with lower thermodynamic stability than (GU)12. The pUG fold can tolerate multiple deoxyribose substitutions but does not fold when the backbone is entirely deoxyribose. It has a high affinity and specificity for potassium ions (K1/2 = 6 mM) and does not fold in sodium or ammonium ions. Addition of 2 mM Mg2+ does not further stabilize the pUG fold, and the polyamines spermine and spermidine slightly decrease its stability. Finally, the pUG fold is sensitive to surrounding sequence context and complementary flanking sequences can stabilize pUG folds, while other sequences can interfere with folding.

PREPL belongs to the serine hydrolase superfamily, but its physiological substrates remain unknown. Based on the predicted lipid binding pocket in its crystal structure and its in vitro esterase activity, we hypothesized that PREPL might act as a lipase in vivo and directly regulate lipid metabolism. To test this, we performed unbiased lipidomics in Prepl knockout (KO) mouse brains and CRISPR-Cas9-generated KO cell lines. Across tissue and cell types, global phospholipid composition was largely unchanged, with only modest, non-significant increases in lysophospholipids, arguing against a direct role of PREPL in (lyso)phospholipid turnover. In contrast, PREPL KO HEK293T cells exhibited a significant accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and an increased number of lipid droplets, indicating a selective shift toward lipid storage. Given the central role of peroxisomes in lipid metabolism, we assessed PREPL localization and examined peroxisome number, morphology, and levels of key peroxisomal proteins. PREPL did not localize to peroxisomes, and peroxisome number and proteins levels were largely unchanged. However, KO cells displayed elongated peroxisomes, a phenotype possibly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Indeed, previous studies have shown that PREPL localizes to mitochondria and is required for respiratory chain activity and oxidative phosphorylation. These mitochondrial defects are predicted to impair fatty acid {beta}-oxidation and disrupt redox balance, thereby promoting TAG synthesis and lipid droplet biogenesis as adaptive responses. Overall, our findings indicate that PREPL does not act as a canonical lipase but indirectly alters lipid homeostasis through its critical role in mitochondrial function. Elevated TAG levels and altered peroxisome morphology likely represent secondary consequences of impaired mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism in PREPL-deficient cells. These results establish a mechanistic link between mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid remodeling in PREPL deficiency, providing novel insights into the metabolic pathology of CMS22.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

J.; Kovac, K.; de Vries, C.; Mashaghi, A.", "abstract": "Nuclear receptors (NRs) comprise a superfamily of (ligand-)regulated transcription factors that are pivotal in orchestrating gene networks essential for development, metabolism, and cellular homeostasis. Their activity is critical for normal physiology, and consequently, dysregulation of NR signaling is implicated in a wide array of human diseases. Within this superfamily, the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are key regulators that exhibit significant crosstalk, primarily antagonistic, which is crucial for modulating inflammatory and stress responses. Despite the recognized importance of their interplay, the precise molecular mechanisms by which GR modulates Nur77's engagement with DNA remain incompletely defined. This study elucidates the direct impact of GR and its ligand, dexamethasone (Dex), on the DNA binding dynamics of Nur77. Single-molecule DNA tightrope assays revealed that Nur77 employs a three-dimensional diffusion-based search mechanism on non-specific DNA, characterized by transient interactions with two distinct dissociation kinetic profiles. GR significantly stabilizes Nur77-DNA interactions, evidenced by a shift towards longer residence times, primarily achieved by slowing the dissociation of the more transiently interacting Nur77 population. Conversely, single-molecule analysis and biochemical assays demonstrated that Dex alone markedly reduces Nur77's overall DNA binding affinity kinetics and frequency in a sequence-dependent manner, to such an extent that accurate quantification was unfeasible. These findings delineate distinct modulatory effects of the GR protein and its ligand on Nur77-DNA interactions, providing crucial biophysical insights into their complex regulatory interplay and revealing a direct, GR-independent impact of dexamethasone on Nur77's DNA engagement.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

A.; Fowler, P. W.", "abstract": "Background: Pyrazinamide is an important first-line antibiotic for treating tuberculosis and resistance is primarily caused by mutations in the pncA gene. Traditional machine learning models have been shown to be able to predict pyrazinamide resistance with some success, but are limited in their ability to incorporate three-dimensional protein structural information. Graph neural networks offer the potential to integrate protein structure and residue-level features to better predict the impact of mutations on drug resistance. Results: We trained a graph convolutional network model on PncA variants containing missense mutations and evaluated its ability to classify resistance to pyrazinamide. Each PncA variant was represented as an amino acid-level graph, with edges based on 3D spatial proximity and node features derived from chemical properties and mutation meta-predictors. We used AlphaFold2 to generate predicted structures of the PncA variants, which we used to create the protein graphs. The predicted structures of resistant PncA variants showed greater deviation from the wild-type structure compared to susceptible variants. Our model achieved an F1 score of 81.6 %, sensitivity of 81.6 % and specificity of 80.4 % on the test set and either matched or exceeded the performance of a published set of traditional machine learning models. We show that both structural graph connectivity and node features contribute significantly to model performance. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that graph-based deep learning can effectively leverage protein structure and biochemical features to accurately predict antimicrobial resistance, in spite of being trained on a small dataset with little variation. We present this as a proof-of-concept for applying these methods to resistance phenotype prediction. Our approach has the potential to be extended to modelling more complex patterns and mechanisms of resistance, particularly in more genetically diverse pathogens.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

The results revealed that oyster peptides at concentrations of 25-50g/mL significantly improved the decline in cell viability and myotube atrophy induced by DEX, while downregulating the expression of muscle atrophy markers Atrogin-1 and MuRF1.

S.; Gupta, A.", "abstract": "During development, embryonic tissues experience mechanical stresses ranging from cellular to supracellular length scales. In response, cells generate active forces that drive rearrangements, allowing the tissue to relax accumulated stresses. The nature of these responses depends strongly on the magnitude and duration of the deformation, giving rise to the tissue's characteristic viscoelastic behavior. Although experiments have characterized tissue rheology in various contexts, simpler theoretical approaches that directly connect cellular activity to emergent rheological behavior are still limited. In this study, we employ a vertex-based model of epithelial tissue incorporating active force fluctuations in cell vertices to represent cell motility. We capture distinct rounding dynamics and motility-dependent timescales by benchmarking against experimental observations such as the bulging of presomitic mesoderm (PSM) explants driven by Fibroblast Growth Factor(FGF) gradients. Stress relaxation tests reveal rapid short-timescale relaxation alongside persistent long-timescale residual stresses that decrease from anterior to posterior (AP) region of the PSM. By applying oscillatory shear, we analyzed the resulting elastic and viscous responses, revealing motility dependence of storage and loss modulus. Finally, we introduce spatially patterned cues applied in a temporally pulsed manner, mimicking dynamic biochemical or mechanical signals during development. Our results show that while higher motility promotes tissue remodeling in response to these cues, this response is constrained by spatial scale; cellular-scale perturbations are relaxed irrespective of motility strength, preventing complete morphological adaptation.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated two such lipids--MSPC (14:0-18:0 PC) and SMPC (18:0-14:0 PC)--to determine how chain length mismatch and acyl chain position on the glycerol backbone influence lateral organization. We studied the temperature- and composition-dependent phase behavior of liposomes composed of either mixed-chain or symmetric-chain high-melting lipids plus DOPC and cholesterol, using techniques sensitive to domain formation at both microscopic and nanoscopic length scales. All studied mixtures exhibited liquid-ordered (Lo) + liquid-disordered (Ld) phase coexistence with domains that were visible in confocal microscopy experiments. FRET measurements showed that all mixtures also exhibited nanoscopic heterogeneity at temperatures above the microscopic miscibility transition temperature, and cryo-EM imaging further revealed bilayer thickness variation consistent with coexisting Ld and Lo phases. Both the microscopic miscibility transition temperature, m-Tmix, and its nanoscopic counterpart, nm-Tmix, were strongly correlated with the melting transition temperature of the saturated lipid; the sole exception was SMPC/DOPC/Chol, whose m-Tmix showed a significant negative deviation from the expected value, implying an enhanced propensity for nanoscopic phase separation in mixtures containing this high-melting species.

Our data shows that scavenging of IFNs diminishes autophagy induced by several respiratory viruses. All types of IFN (I, II and III) mediated robust autophagic flux activation in both cell lines and primary human lung fibroblasts in a JAK1-3 dependent manner. Depletion or pharmacological inhibition of individual STAT transcription factors demonstrated that both STAT1 and STAT5B are required for IFN-induced autophagy. Upon IFN stimulation STAT1 and STAT5B associate and translocate to the nucleus. Transcriptome analyses revealed that inhibition of STAT5 only reduces expression of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes, whereas most known anti-viral IFN-stimulated genes remain induced to high levels. Among the STAT5 dependent genes was Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 (SOCS1). Overexpression of SOCS1 stimulated autophagy, whereas its depletion impaired IFN-induced autophagy. Successful viruses like measles virus (MeV) or respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) evolved strategies to exploit autophagy to promote their own replication. Uncoupling IFN-mediated ISG defenses from autophagy induction using by STAT5 inhibition reduced virus-induced autophagy, and inhibited efficient replication of autophagy-dependent MeV and RSV.

However, the spatial distribution and environmental drivers of its major pathways, i.e., nitrogen fixation, denitrification, assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (ANRA, DNRA), and nitrification are not well known. Furthermore, the taxonomic composition of the prokaryotes supporting each pathway remain incompletely understood. Leveraging newly assembled global marine metagenomic datasets and a state-of-the-art machine learning framework, we inferred the global biogeography of the genomic potential for key metabolic pathways of the marine nitrogen cycle. This was achieved using a multi-output regression of gene read counts against environmental climatologies. Our results reveal distinct biogeographic patterns of genomic potential: anaerobic or light-inhibited pathways are enriched in high-latitude regions, eastern boundary upwelling systems, and deeper ocean layers, while nitrogen fixation and ANRA dominate in oligotrophic gyres. These patterns are consistent with known metabolic strategies and model-based estimates. Moreover, we identify distinct microbial communities mediating these two types of nitrogen transformations, with Cyanobacteria associated primarily with aerobic, biosynthetic pathways, while Gammaproteobacteria and Nitrososphaeria encoding for nitrogen transformations related to energy requirements. By coupling microbial community composition with genome-level information, our approach advances understanding of the microbial foundations of nitrogen transformation pathways and offers new insights on underrepresented processes into biogeochemical models. We highlights the growing value of omic data to better understand marine ecosystem function in relation to environmental gradients and community composition, and their use as a potential observation-based alternative or complement to biogeochemical models.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone (O3) is a major air pollutant that threatens crop productivity, yet its effects depend strongly on environmental conditions that regulate plant O3 uptake. Here, we explore how citrus, an O3-sensitive perennial crop, responds to O3 exposure under humid subtropical (Florida) and semi-arid (California) climates. In controlled chamber experiments, Meyer lemon trees exposed to moderate O3 concentrations (80 ppb for 4 h d-1 over four days) showed a faster and more persistent decline in the maximum photosystem II efficiency (Fv/Fm) under humid air, while under dry air the response was delayed by one day and reversible. This humidity-dependent behavior reflects differences in stomatal conductance (gs) where high humidity maintains open stomata and accelerates O3 flux and dry air limits uptake but enhances slower non-stomatal injury pathways. At regional scale, satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI revealed similar patterns. In Florida, SIF decreased significantly during O3-episode weeks and remained low for up to three weeks, while in California it showed a brief rebound before a delayed decline - mirroring the timing observed in the chamber experiment. Analysis of the SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) relationship further showed that O3 decoupled canopy fluorescence from productivity in the dry region, whereas drought stress weakened this coupling in the humid region, indicating a climate-specific shift in the dominant stressor. We demonstrate and argue that humidity governs both the timing and persistence of O3 injury, linking leaf-level physiology to regional canopy responses. These findings emphasize that effective O3-risk assessments for perennial crops must incorporate local humidity and vapor pressure deficit conditions and both stomatal and non-stomatal deposition pathways.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

A.; Ferrari, T.; Mooney, J. A.", "abstract": "Complex demographic events have shaped human history, leaving signatures of genetic variation across the genome. Here, we recover the recent evolutionary history of admixed populations formed from multiple ancestral sources. We present a discrete, generalizable model of admixture that leverages ancestry switches, which are recombination breakpoints that mark changes in ancestral origin along a chromosome. We derive analytical expectations for the number of ancestry switches within a genomic segment as functions of recombination rate, ancestry heterozygosity, and effective population size, and extend these expectations to incorporate population-specific recombination maps. Forward-time simulations tracing ancestry junctions for ten generations after admixture show close agreement with theoretical predictions under constant and variable recombination models. We observe minimal variability in switch counts across ten replicates, underscoring the robustness of the theoretical expectation. Furthermore, model-based switch counts agree with empirical observations from African American individuals in the 1000 Genomes Project. For example, when modeling human chromosome 1, we found a mean of approximately six switches per haplotype, which aligns with the theoretical expectation under an initial African ancestry proportion of 0.85, and agrees with published estimates from other African-American cohorts. Overall, the model provides a new route for using ancestry switches to reconstruct how recombination and demography jointly shape ancestry patterns in admixed populations without requiring separation into parental sources.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

O.; Manica, A.", "abstract": "The extent to which selection acts upon the same molecular targets when faced with the same environmental changes has important implications for our understanding of the repeatability and predictability of evolutionary processes. Replicated natural experiments are well positioned to provide insight, however often these involve closely related species or populations of the same species. Given that the similarity of genetic background makes the same molecular change more likely, it is essential to evaluate the extent to which molecular parallelism occurs in more distantly related species. The rise of the Isthmus of Panama presents an ideal natural experiment to investigate the prevalence of parallel molecular changes in distantly related lineages exposed to the same environmental regimes of temperature, salinity and primary productivity in the two newly formed oceans. Here, we generate high-quality reference genomes for two replicate pairs of geminate reef fishes, one in the family Pomacentridae and one in the Serranidae. Comparative analyses of positive selection in protein-coding genes and of gene family evolution revealed multiple signals of potentially adaptive divergence between geminate species in response to environmental regime. Common targets of selection between families included MAPK signalling (MAP3K10), solute transport (SLC46A2) and reproduction (ZPL3L), as well as expansions in immune and MAPK related gene families. Overall, however, we found minimal evidence of parallelism between families either at the gene level or when considering higher functional categories. Our findings suggest that phylogenetic constraints may limit the levels of molecular parallelism in distant lineages even when faced with comparable selective pressures.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

Here we develop a new SV calling method that jointly considers the alignment against a pangenome and the de novo assembly of the germline genome. It dramatically reduces false positive mosaic SVs in normal samples and somatic SVs in cancer cell lines with little loss in sensitivity. Our study highlights the essential need for pangenome or personal genome assembly to integrate SV calls for both SV discoveries and clinical diagnostics.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}

H.; Mehta, D.; Heberle, F. A.", "abstract": "We present a robust and easy-to-use methodology for determining the nanoscopic miscibility transition temperature, nm-Tmix, of lipid bilayer mixtures from FRET measurements. The method relies on the use of freely diffusing fluorescent donor and acceptor lipids that partition non-uniformly between coexisting ordered and disordered phases. When this condition is met, changes in lipid clustering that occur as the sample passes through the transition result in abrupt changes in the spatial distribution of probes and consequently, abrupt changes in the FRET signal. FRET vs. temperature data can then be modeled with a phenomenological piecewise function that describes how the signal changes above and below nm-Tmix. Using lattice simulations, we show that the transition between these regimes occurs when the size of lipid clusters surpasses a critical threshold that is approximately equal to twice the Forster distance of the donor/acceptor pair, or about 10 nm. Because other, trivial factors can also influence the FRET signal (for example, temperature-dependent changes in the average lipid molecular area), we also fit the data using a simpler model of uniform mixing. An information theory-based test comparing the fit quality of the uniform and phase separated models provides a straightforward and robust criterion for objectively assessing whether a given sample undergoes a nanoscopic miscibility transition within a temperature range of interest. We highlight the distinction between nm-Tmix determined by FRET (or methods with comparable spatial resolution) and the micron-scale transition temperature, m-Tmix, determined from diffraction-limited optical techniques.

C.; Perales, H.; Pinero, D.; Mastretta-Yanes, A.", "abstract": "Understanding how genetic diversity is distributed within maize races is critical for conserving maize genetic diversity. While maize races are traditionally treated as homogeneous units to be targeted by conservation, each race may encompass genetically distinct populations of landraces, shaped by environmental conditions and farmer selection. In this study, the genetic diversity and population structure of the Olotillo race were examined using 89,810 SNPs from 158 samples collected across local, regional, and national scales in Mexico. Additional samples from other races Dzit-bacal, Tuxpeno, and a Mix group combining Olotillo with other varieties, brought the total to 171 individuals. Population structure analyses (ADMIXTURE, PCA) revealed that genetic clusters do not align with race identity, but instead reflect geographic origin. Inbreeding depression was evident within Olotillo populations, with mean FIS = 0.746 {+/-} 0.066. A heterozygote deficiency was observed: mean HeOB = 0.075 {+/-} 0.020, compared to a higher expected heterozygosity (HeEX = 0.295 {+/-} 0.002). Expected homozygosity (HOEX) of 0.705 {+/-} 0.002 was observed, reflecting reduced effective genetic variation. The above is reflected in the population contraction signal (e.g., positive Tajimas D), and no significant differences between scales in HeEX, HOEX, and nucleotide diversity ({pi}), suggesting that similar evolutionary forces act across regions with a strong directional selection. These findings underscore the need to ascertain the genetic background among races and to recognize meaningful within-race differentiation. Conservation actions should reflect this structure, promoting targeted seed exchange to counteract genetic erosion while respecting farmer preferences. Olotillo exemplifies how maize diversity is structured not only by genetics, but by cultural and management systems that shape evolution in situ.", "date": "2025-10-28", "journal": ""}
