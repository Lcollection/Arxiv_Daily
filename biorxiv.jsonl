The lamina-associated domain at the inner nuclear membrane has been shown to harbor heterochromatin, while the nuclear interior has been shown to contain most of the euchromatin. Here, we show that a sub-set of actively transcribing genes, marked by RNA Pol II pSer2, are associated with Lamin B1 at the inner nuclear envelope in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and the number of genes proportionally increases upon in vitro differentiation of mESC to olfactory precursor cells. These nuclear periphery-associated actively transcribing genes primarily represent housekeeping genes, and their gene bodies are significantly enriched with guanine and cytosine compared to genes actively transcribed at the nuclear interior. We found the promoters of these genes to also be significantly enriched with guanine and to be predominantly regulated by zinc finger protein transcription factors. We provide evidence supporting the emerging notion that the Lamin B1 region is not solely transcriptionally silent.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

N.; Lazzari, J.; Saxena, S.", "abstract": "How does the motor cortex (MC) produce purposeful and generalizable movements with the complex musculoskeletal system in a dynamic environment? To elucidate the underlying neural dynamics, we use a goal-driven approach to model MC by considering its goal as a controller driving the musculoskeletal system through desired states to achieve movement. Specifically, we formulate a model of MC as a recurrent neural network (RNN) controller producing muscle commands while receiving sensory feedback from biologically accurate musculoskeletal models. Given this real-time simulated feedback implemented in advanced physics simulation engines, we use deep reinforcement learning to train the RNN to execute desired movements under specified neural and musculoskeletal constraints. For general use, we provide a modular computational framework that allows the flexible integration of user-defined musculoskeletal models, training algorithms, tasks and constraints. We also provide a combination of modules to analyze and quantify the dynamical alignment and similarity of the trained RNN with the recorded neural data on the population and single-unit level. Using these modules, we find that the activity of the trained RNN can accurately decode experimentally recorded neural population dynamics and single-unit MC activity, while generalizing well to testing conditions significantly different from training. Finally, we also provide perturbation modules to generate insights about neural dynamics for perturbed conditions different from training, and show that this framework unveils computational principles of how such neural dynamics enable flexible control of movement.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Integrated information theory (IIT) predicts that such vivid experiences may occur when the cortical substrate of consciousness is virtually silent. To test this, we analyzed high-quality 256-electrode high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) from twenty-two long-term Vajrayana and Zen meditators who reported reaching PP during a week-long retreat. Because neural activity typically increases gamma power, we predicted PP would show widespread gamma reductions. Across both traditions, PP was associated with broadband power decrease compared to within-meditation mind-wandering, most consistent in the gamma range (30-45 Hz). Source reconstruction revealed widespread gamma decreases, strongest in posteromedial cortex. PP gamma power was lower than in all other control states, including watching or imagining a movie, active thinking, and open-monitoring. PP delta power (1-4Hz) was also markedly reduced compared to dreamless sleep. Meditative states resembling PP--with minimal perceptual contents or accompanied by bliss--showed similar signatures. Overall, PP appears to be a state of vivid consciousness during which the cortex is highly awake (low delta) yet widely quiescent (low gamma), in line with IIT's predictions.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we analyze the evolution of wtf genes across 21 strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

As proof-of-principle, we generate a novel meiotic driver through artificial recombination between wtf drivers, and its encoded poison cannot be detoxified by the antidotes encoded by their parental wtf genes but can be detoxified by its own antidote.

However, the precise mechanism linking ERK activity to memory stabilization and restabilization are still poorly understood, and the role of ERK1/2 dimerization remains unexplored. ERK dimerization is essential for the binding and activation of cytoplasmic targets, many of which have been strongly implicated in memory and plasticity. In this work, we studied the role of ERK2 dimerization in memory and synaptic plasticity through several experimental approaches. We found that reactivation of a weak inhibitory avoidance (wIA) memory led to a significant reduction in hippocampal ERK2 dimerization. Furthermore, intrahippocampal infusion of DEL-22379 (DEL), an ERK dimerization inhibitor, following memory reactivation had a bidirectional effect: it blocked the reconsolidation of a strong inhibitory avoidance (sIA) memory, but enhanced the reconsolidation of a wIA memory. Moreover, DEL administration blocked hippocampal ERK2 dimerization in vivo and impaired high-frequency stimulation-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices. These findings demonstrate for the first time that ERK2 dimerization occurs in the intact rodent nervous system and plays a pivotal role in plasticity and memory. While further research is needed, this study highlights the relevance of ERK dimerization in these processes.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Previously, we showed that representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) of the shape ratings of pseudowords correlated significantly with RDMs of acoustic parameters reflecting spectro-temporal variations; the ratings also correlated significantly with voice quality parameters. Here, we examined how perceptual ratings relate to these parameters of pseudowords across eight meaning domains. We largely replicated our previous findings for shape, while observing different patterns for other domains. Using a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) machine-learning algorithm, we compared 4095 combinations of twelve acoustic parameters (3 spectro-temporal and 9 characterizing vocal quality) to determine the optimal combination associated with iconicity ratings in each domain. We found that iconic mappings were linked to domain-specific combinations of acoustic parameters. One spectro-temporal parameter, the fast Fourier transform, contributed to all domains, indicating the importance of time-varying spectral properties for iconicity judgments. We applied the KNN approach to generate shape ratings for 160 real words. These generated ratings strongly correlated with perceptual ratings of real words, indicating the value of the KNN approach to assess iconic mapping in natural languages.

One notable missing feature in most ANN models is top-down feedback, i.e. projections from higher-order layers to lower-order layers in the network. Top-down feedback is ubiquitous in the brain, and it has a unique modulatory impact on activity in neocortical pyramidal neurons. However, we still do not understand its computational role. Here we develop a deep neural network model that captures the core functional properties of top-down feedback in the neocortex, allowing us to construct hierarchical recurrent ANN models that more closely reflect the architecture of the brain. We use this to explore the impact of different hierarchical recurrent architectures on an audiovisual integration task. We find that certain hierarchies, namely those that mimic the architecture of the human brain, impart ANN models with a light visual bias similar to that seen in humans. This bias does not impair performance on the audiovisual tasks. The results further suggest that different configurations of top-down feedback make otherwise identically connected models functionally distinct from each other, and from traditional feedforward and laterally recurrent models. Altogether our findings demonstrate that modulatory top-down feedback is a computationally relevant feature of biological brains, and that incorporating it into ANNs affects their behavior and constrains the solutions it's likely to discover.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of consensus on how to evaluate the quality of the recovered manifolds. Here, we present a novel measure of distortion to evaluate low-dimensional representations obtained using different techniques. We additionally develop a novel bottom-up manifold learning technique called Riemannian Alignment of Tangent Spaces (RATS) that aims to recover low-distortion embeddings of data, including the ability to embed closed manifolds into their intrinsic dimension using a unique tearing process.

One prominent approach to forecasting such long-run outcomes is the successor representation (SR), which predicts future states aggregated over multiple timesteps. Although much behavioral and neural evidence suggests that people and animals use such a representation, it remains unknown how they acquire it. It has frequently been assumed to be learned by temporal difference bootstrapping (SR-TD(0)), but this assumption has largely not been empirically tested or compared to alternatives including eligibility traces (SR-TD({lambda} > 0)). Here we address this gap by leveraging trial-by-trial reaction times in graph sequence learning tasks, which are favorable for studying learning dynamics because the long horizons in these studies differentiate the transient update dynamics of different learning rules. We examined the behavior of SR-TD({lambda}) on a probabilistic graph learning task alongside a number of alternatives, and found that behavior was best explained by a hybrid model which learned via SR-TD({lambda}) alongside an additional predictive model of recency. The relatively large {lambda} we estimate indicates a predominant role of eligibility trace mechanisms over the bootstrap-based chaining typically assumed. Our results provide insight into how humans learn predictive representations, and demonstrate that people simultaneously learn the SR alongside lower-order predictions.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Here we characterise how well a freely-available tool we have developed, gnomonicus, predicts the antibiotic resistance profile of a sample (given its variant call file) using our implementation of the second edition of the WHO catalogue of resistance-associated variants (WHOv2). To facilitate this, we have constructed a Diverse Testset of 2,663 publicly-available M. tuberculosis samples which have both genetic and drug susceptibility testing (DST) data. We have chosen to apply the catalogue such that our tool will return a result of (i) Fail if there are insufficient reads at a genetic locus associated with resistance, (ii) Unknown if a genetic variant in a resistance gene not listed in the catalogue is encountered and (iii) Resistant if three or more short-reads support the presence of a resistance-associated variant. The last step increases the sensitivity for all 15 antibiotics but only reaches significance in a few in our testset. Comparing our results to those of TB-Profiler, an existing tool, highlights the different design choices and demonstrates the performance of both tools on our Diverse Testset is comparable.

While lower L2HGDH expression was found to portend a strikingly worse prognosis in a multivariate survival analysis of ccRCC patients (n=509; TCGA) highlighting its translational importance, the paradoxical downregulation of HIF1A mRNA in ccRCC despite the upregulation of HIF1 protein (secondary to VHL loss) is of significant scientific interest. Using a comprehensive array of in vitro assays, clinicogenomic bioinformatic analyses of large ccRCC datasets, and the Cdh16-Cre Vhl-fl mouse model with kidney specific Vhl-loss, we show that the hypoxia-inducible factors upregulate miR21-3p and miR155-5p, which subsequently target L2HGDH and HIF1A respectively, during ccRCC pathogenesis and progression. In doing so, we unveil a conserved inhibitory feedback loop for HIF1A in ccRCC (HIFs[-&gt;]miR155[-&gt;]HIF1A), providing a mechanistic explanation for HIF1A downregulation despite elevated HIF1 protein.

Using resting-state fMRI, we compared functional connectome gradients and their association with cortical structure. Both groups exhibited similar principal gradients: unimodal to transmodal, somatosensory to visual, and frontoparietal segregation, demonstrating that the fundamental scaffold of cortical organization emerges largely independently of visual experience. However, blindness altered specific features of the functional connectome: the visual network was more segregated from the sensorimotor network and more integrated with transmodal and frontoparietal networks. Moreover, blind individuals showed reduced canonical hierarchical ordering within early visual areas, weaker structure-function coupling in visual and temporal regions, and altered functional areal boundaries in V1.

Here, we study the implications of heterogeneous inhibitory neurons on the dynamics and computations of spatially-structured neural networks. We develop a mean-field model of the system in order to systematically examine excitation-inhibition balance, dynamical stability, and cell-type specific gain modulations. The model incorporates three inhibitory cell types and excitatory neurons with distinct connectivity probabilities and recent evidence of long-range spatial projections of SST neurons. Position-dependent firing rate predictions are validated against simulations, and balanced solutions under Gaussian assumptions are derived from scaling arguments. Stability analysis shows that while long-range inhibitory projections in E-I circuits with a homogeneous inhibitory population result in instability, the heterogeneous network maintains stability with long-range SST projections. This suggests that a mixture of short and long-range inhibitions may be key to providing diverse computations while maintaining stability. We further find that conductance-based synaptic transmissions are necessary to reproduce experimentally observed cell-type-specific gain modulations of inhibition by PV and SST neurons. These gain modulations are distance-dependent, and a linear response analysis suggested that shifts in the excitation-inhibition balance of the network underlie these effects.

Heterozygous dominant mutations in the nucleoporin RANBP2/Nup358 predispose to influenza-triggered ANE1. The aim of our study was to determine whether RANBP2 plays a role in IAV-triggered inflammatory responses. We found that the depletion of RANBP2 in a human airway epithelial cell line increased IAV genomic replication by favouring the import of the viral polymerase subunits, PB1, PB2 and PA following viral transcription and translation. Additionally, RANBP2 knockdown enhanced the cytoplasmic export of viral RNA (vRNA) and disrupted segment stoichiometry, which associated with elevated production of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4 in human primary macrophages. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in for the ANE1 disease variant RANBP2-T585M, we further demonstrate that this point mutation causes a loss-of-localisation phenotype that excludes RANBP2 from the nuclear envelope, which phenocopies RANBP2 knockdown by increasing IAV replication and driving pro-inflammatory cytokine expression following infection. Together, our results reveal that RANBP2 regulates influenza RNA replication and nuclear export, thereby restraining virus-induced hyperinflammation, and further suggest that ANE1 pathogenesis results from the impaired localisation of RANBP2 at the nuclear envelope.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

This capability is at the heart of OFCs proposed role in a network responsible for cognitive mapping, and its loss can explain many deficits associated with OFC damage or inactivation. Substance use disorder is defined by behaviors that share much in common with these deficits, such as an inability to modify learned behaviors in the face of new information about undesired consequences. One explanation for this similarity would be if addictive drugs impacted the ability of OFC to recognize underlying similarities, hidden states, that allow information learned in one setting to be used in another. To explore this possibility, we trained rats to self-administer cocaine and then recorded single unit activity in lateral OFC as these rats performed in an odor sequence task consisting of unique and shared positions. In well-trained controls, we observed chance decoding of sequence at shared positions and near chance decoding even at unique positions, reflecting the irrelevance of distinguishing these positions in the task. By contrast, in cocaine-experienced rats, decoding remained significantly elevated, particularly at the positions that had superficial sensory differences that were collapsed in controls across learning. These neural differences were accompanied by increases in behavioral variability at these positions.

The ability to consistently identify N. gonorrhoeae lineages is important for surveillance of this increasingly antimicrobial resistant organism, facilitating efficient communication regarding its epidemiology; however, all current typing systems fail to reflect N. gonorrhoeae strain taxonomy in a reliable and stable manner. Here, a N. gonorrhoeae genomic lineage nomenclature, based on the barcoding system of Life Identification Number (LIN) codes, was developed using a refined 1430 core gene MLST (cgMLST). This hierarchical LIN code nomenclature conveys lineage information at multiple levels of resolution within one code, enabling it to provide immediate context to an isolate's ancestry, and to relate to familiar, previously used typing schemes such as Ng cgMLST v1, 7-locus MLST, or NG-STAR clonal complex (CC). Clustering with LIN codes accurately reflects gonococcal diversity and population structure, providing insight into associations between genotype and phenotype for traits such as antibiotic resistance.

While detecting spatially variable molecules is a well-studied problem, robust methods for identifying spatially varying co-expression between molecule pairs remain limited. We introduce SpaceBF, a Bayesian fused modeling framework that estimates co-expression at both local (location-specific) and global (tissue-wide) levels. SpaceBF enforces spatial smoothness via a fused horseshoe prior on the edges of a predefined spatial adjacency graph, allowing large, edge-specific differences to escape shrinkage while preserving overall structure. In extensive simulations, SpaceBF achieves higher specificity and power than commonly used methods that leverage geospatial metrics, including bivariate Moran's I and Lee's L. We also benchmark the proposed prior against standard alternatives, such as intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) and Mat'ern priors. Applied to spatial transcriptomics and proteomics datasets, SpaceBF reveals cancer-relevant molecular interactions and patterns of cell-cell communication (e.g., ligand-receptor signaling), demonstrating its utility for principled, uncertainty-aware co-expression analysis of spatial omics data.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

The barcode lineage tracking (BLT) approach is an important advance toward measuring DFEs. BLT experiments enable researchers to track the frequencies of ~105 of barcoded lineages in large microbial populations and detect up to thousands of nascent beneficial mutations in a single experiment. However, reliably identifying adapted lineages and estimating the fitness effects of driver mutations remains a challenge because lineage dynamics are subject to demographic and measurement noise and competition with other lineages. We show that the commonly used Levy-Blundell method for analyzing BLT data and its improved version FitMut2 can produce biased fitness estimates, particularly if selection is strong. To address this problem, we develop a new method called BASIL (BAyesian Selection Inference for Lineage tracking data), which dynamically updates the belief distribution of each lineage's fitness and size based on the number of barcode reads. We calibrate BASIL's model of noise with new experimental data and find that noise variance scales non-linearly with lineage abundance. We test how BASIL and FitMut2 perform on simulated data and on down-sampled data from the original BLT data by Levy et al and find that BASIL is both more robust and more accurate than FitMut2. Our work paves the way for a systematic inference of the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations from BLT experiments in a variety of scenarios.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Classical experiments have suggested that contact between cells derived from distinct orientations-dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior-within the regenerating blastema is necessary for accurate limb pattern formation. However, the molecular basis for this requirement has remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that both dorsal and ventral tissues are required for limb formation via induction of Shh expression, which plays a crucial role in limb patterning. Using the accessory limb model (ALM), we induced position-specific blastemas lacking cells derived from a single orientation (anterior, posterior, dorsal, or ventral). Patterned limb formation occurred only in blastemas containing both dorsal- and ventral-derived cells. We further observed that Shh expression requires dorsoventral contact within a blastema, highlighting the necessity of dorsoventral contact for inducing Shh expression. In addition, we identified WNT10B and FGF2 as dorsal- and ventral-mediated signals, respectively, that create the inductive environment for Shh expression. Our findings clarify the role of dorsal and ventral cells in inducing Shh, a mechanism that has rarely been studied in the context of limb regeneration and pattern formation.

This represents the most extensive and highest degree of homology reported to date between a viral protein and an MHC class I molecule. Phylogenetic analysis of MHC class I-like DNA sequences from primate HLA-A orthologs and SBHV4-S9 gene suggested that SBHV4-S9 was likely acquired via LINE-1-mediated horizontal gene transfer from the African Old World monkey Piliocolobus tephrosceles or a close ancestor 1.63-6.02 million years ago. SBHV4-S9 appeared to have undergone purifying selection following divergence from P. tephrosceles. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the SBHV4-S1 gene and primate SLAMF6-like genes suggested that this gene was acquired after divergence from a close ancestor of the New World monkeys Saimiri oerstedii and Saimiri sciureus. Comprehensive evaluation of the similarity between eight SBHV4 genes (including S1 and S9) and their respective homologs in 241 primate species, assessed via PCA-syncmer-based Wasserstein distances, revealed that the overall relatedness between SBHV4 and African Cercopithecus ascanius, Cercopithecus pogonias, and Allenopithecus nigroviridis, respectively was significantly greater (i.e., exhibited shorter Wasserstein distances) in each case than that observed with all examined members of the genus Saimiri and Piliocolobus tephrosceles.

In contrast, non-mammalian orthologues function as anion transporters, lacking electromechanical activity. To investigate the molecular and structural basis of this functional divergence, we performed ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) of prestin across vertebrates, followed by comparative structural modeling using AlphaFold2-multimer. We identified more than 200 amino acid substitutions along the lineage that lead to placental mammals, with early substitutions concentrated in the transmembrane domain (TMD) and late substitutions clustering in the STAS domain, particularly in the intervening sequence (IVS). Structural modeling revealed that early substitutions modulate protein-lipid interactions and interhelical contacts. In placental mammals, the IVS-oop adopts a distinct conformation that places a negatively charged patch near the chloride access pathway, potentially affecting the ion dynamics and voltage responsiveness. These structural transitions occurred without major rearrangements of the global fold of prestin, supporting a notion in which the novel function evolved through distributed substitutions within a conserved scaffold. Our findings illustrate how molecular exaptation, and incremental structural remodeling enabled the repurposing of an ancestral anion transporter into a voltage-sensitive area-motor, providing a framework for understanding the molecular evolution of complex biophysical traits central to auditory neuroscience.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Clonality is particularly common in harsh environments and at the margins of species ranges, where it supports persistence, enables rapid growth, and promotes the maintenance of locally adapted genotypes. In the rapidly changing Arctic, increasing ecological connectivity is eroding historical barriers for sessile species. Evaluating genetic diversity in this context, before global change further alters Arctic ocean, is essential for understanding evolutionary dynamics during range expansion and for informing conservation strategies. Aulactinia stella is a circumpolar sea anemone with physiological characteristics in laboratory conditions suggesting a potential for clonal reproduction. In this study, we investigated its reproductive modes in natural populations across the Arctic ocean, from the northern Pacific to the Atlantic, and examined how genetic diversity is structured between adults and juveniles at five sampled sites. Across all study sites, we observed only females or individuals lacking gonads, with the exception of Kamchatka, where males were also present. Genetic indices and changes in genotype frequencies between adults and juveniles confirmed that this species reproduces partially by parthenogenesis. Populations on the Atlantic side were highly clonal with clonal rates (c) estimated at 80-99%, whereas populations on the Pacific side reproduced more sexually (c around 50%). Allelic diversity was twice as high in Kamchatka and Kuril populations, suggesting North Pacific coasts being the main last glacial refugia of A. stella. We found a stepping-stone pattern of genetic structure from Kamchatka to Atlantic populations, consistent with contemporary ocean currents and melted summer sea ice. Only a subset of the juvenile genetic diversity, mostly of local origin, was found in the established adults, while juveniles exhibited lower levels of genetic differentiation across the Arctic Ocean. Our findings underscore the need for further ecological and behavioral investigations to elucidate the mechanisms allowing the current possibilities of dispersal of this species across the Arctic Ocean.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

We rendered thousands of object images, varying in lighting, shape, and viewpoint, and crowdsourced perceptual reflectance estimates for each image. Curiously, gloss judgments were highly consistent with one another, yet systematically deviated from reality. We compared the responses with neural networks trained on two different learning objectives: one set trained to estimate physical reflectance (ground-truth networks) and another to mimic the human responses (human-like networks). By reducing network size, we identified the minimum computations needed for each objective. While estimating physical reflectance required deep networks, shallow networks with as few as three layers accurately replicated human judgments. Remarkably, even a miniscule network with just a single filter could predict human judgments better than the best ground-truth network. The human-like networks also captured known gloss illusions outside the training range. These results suggest human gloss judgments rely on simpler, more general-purpose computations than previously thought, and also demonstrate the extraordinary power of using tiny but interpretable neural networks to uncover functional computations in human brains.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Apical actomyosin is required to fold the neuroepithelium (NE), with a midline hinge and lateral neural folds into the neural tube. However, the large size and complex tissue curvature has complicated a detailed analysis of its actomyosin networks. Here, we developed a computational workflow to create 2D apical shell reconstructions of the NE. Using these projections, we confirmed a midline-lateral gradient of apical cell area and discovered a negative correlated gradient of actomyosin density. We hypothesized that lateral neural folds, with high apical cell constriction and actomyosin, have higher apical tension than the midline hinge, with large apical cell area and low actomyosin. Through target laser ablations in live embryos that allow us to infer tension, we confirmed that tension is isotropic and low at the midline and anisotropic and high on the lateral neural folds. Finally, we identified sex differences in cell shape, apical constriction rates, actomyosin in the NE at an earlier time point than previously appreciated. We use these findings to propose a lateral tension mechanism used in murine NTC that is distinct from the contractile hinge mechanism identified in other model systems.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

We use coarse-grain MD simulations with the CALVADOS model to investigate the conformational landscape of tau without and with phosphorylations. Characterizing the local compacity of IDPs allows us to highlight how disorder comes in various flavors, as we can define different domains along the tau sequence. We define the IDP's Statistical Tertiary Organization (STO) as the average spatial arrangements of domains, which constitutes an extension of the tertiary structure of folded proteins. We also use IDP specific metrics to characterize the local curvature and flexibility of tau. Comparing the local flexibilities with T2 relaxation times from NMR experiments, we show how this metric is related to the protein dynamics. A curvature and flexibility pattern in the repeat domains can also be connected to tau binding properties, without having to explicitly model the protein's interaction partner.

We additionally recruited three control groups: 8 permanently congenitally blind individuals, 11 individuals with reversed later-onset cataracts (developmental cataract reversal individuals), and 24 age- and sex-matched typically sighted controls. Results Diffusion tensor metrics exhibited significant group differences which were specific to visual tracts. Compared to normally sighted controls, congenitally blind and congenital cataract reversal individuals both showed impaired white matter integrity. However, differences were much more spatially extensive for permanently congenitally blind individuals, and a direct comparison revealed relatively higher tract integrity for congenital cataract reversal individuals, suggesting a high degree of recovery following sight restoration. Discussion The present pattern of results is compatible with the idea of both a sensitive period for white matter development and significant white matter plasticity later in life. We propose that group differences are largely driven by differences in myelination.

These streaks are caused by non-uniform material removal forming long straight trenches parallel to the FIB milling direction. These artifacts get worse along the milling direction and ultimately limit size of the SEM field of view. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate the streaks in acquired images. While these techniques often provide noticeable visual improvement, the underlying problem remains. The structural information in the 'streaked' areas is lost due to non-uniform material removal during milling and cannot be fully recovered. We propose a simple modification allowing for a significant reduction of milling non-uniformities of streaks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on various samples.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) is a vital intercellular messenger with diverse signaling functions throughout the human body. We have characterized and implemented a novel, in vitro fluorescence-based method of measuring 5-HT binding to gain a fuller understanding of the interactions between 5-HT and its receptors. This method involves expression of 5-HT receptor proteins in cultured cells with the fluorescent, non-canonical amino acid L-3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2-aminopropanoic acid (ANAP) incorporated into the ligand binding site. ANAP fluorescence was quenched in solution by both 5-HT and dopamine. Time-resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed that ANAP quenching by 5-HT occurs via a charge-transfer process that recovers through back-electron transfer on the nanosecond timescale. Supported by density functional theory calculations, this process likely involved a ANAP reduction by 5-HT. To test this method on intact receptors in a cellular context, we expressed 5-HT3A receptors (5-HT-gated ion channels) in HEK293T cells with ANAP inserted co-translationally into the transmitter binding site. Fluorescently labeled 5-HT3A receptors were functional and activated by 5-HT, as assessed by whole-cell patch clamp. Addition of 5-HT caused a concentration-dependent quenching of fluorescence from ANAP-tagged channels in intact cells and unroofed plasma membranes, demonstrating the utility of this method for measuring 5-HT binding to its receptors. Collectively, these results delineate a technique for measuring transmitter binding that can be widely adopted to explore 5-HT binding not only to 5-HT3 receptors, but to any 5-HT receptor, transporter, or binding protein in heterologous expression systems.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Fluorescent microscopic analysis with a chitin-specific dye, Calcofluor white, demonstrated reduced A. solani colonization in PKM-1 pretreated with LaM (0.1%), followed by A. solani infection on par with Arka Rakshak.

M.; Buzhdygan, T.; Fossati, S.", "abstract": "Background: Disrupted brain hemodynamics and cerebrovascular damage resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion occur early within Alzheimers Disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cerebral hypoperfusion is also an extremely common consequence of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases (CVRFs/CVDs), which usually manifest in midlife, when AD pathology initiates, and actively contribute to AD onset and progression. Previously our lab has demonstrated that the vasculotropic Dutch mutant, amyloid beta Q22, and amyloid beta 42 promote endothelial cells (ECs) apoptosis, barrier permeability, and angiogenic impairments. Prior research has indicated that hypoperfusion promotes analogous EC dysfunction. Amyloid beta deposition occurs within a hypoperfused environment in AD, but whether exposure of cerebral ECs to amyloid beta under hypoperfusion results in potentiated cerebral EC dysfunction through activation of common molecular mechanisms remained unknown. Methods: Human cerebral ECs were treated with Amyloid beta 40-Q22 or Amyloid beta 42, glucose deprivation (GD), or a combination of both, under normoxia or hypoxia conditions. Cell death mechanisms (apoptosis/necrosis), endothelial barrier dysfunction/permeability (TEER/barrier-regulating proteins/proinflammatory activation), and angiogenesis impairment (vessel branching/VEGF signaling) were evaluated. Results: Reduction of glucose and/or oxygen potentiates Amyloid-induced cerebral EC death, barrier instability, junction protein dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and angiogenesis/wound healing failure. In particular, hypoperfusion exacerbates Amyloid beta Q22-mediated cerebral EC apoptosis, TEER/ZO1 decreases, ICAM1, IL6, and IL8 upregulation, monocyte migration, and wound healing impairments. Differentially, when in combination with Amyloid beta 42, hypoperfusion more strongly potentiates cerebral EC necrosis as well as increases in MMP2, phosphorylated claudin-5, IFN gamma, and IL12p70 expression. Additionally, this study identified that GD exerts stronger effects on promoting increases in cerebral EC caspase-3 activation, apoptosis, and MMP2/ICAM1 expression, while hypoxia particularly increases necrosis, ZO1 expression, and pro-angiogenic protein expression. Conclusions: This study reveals specific and selective mechanisms through which hypoxia, low glucose and amyloidosis mutually operate to produce brain EC dysfunction and death, highlighting new potential molecular targets against vascular pathology in AD/CAA comorbid with hypoperfusion conditions.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Materials and Methods: Seven-day-old (P7) C57BL/6J mice maintained in room air (controls) or subjected to oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) were treated with/without 20 mg/kg of the CYP46A1 activator efavirenz (EFV) from P7 to P17.

Instead, lifetime growth curves capture the same central aspect of individuals life-history, while accounting for its dynamics through time. Growth curve is a complex, function-valued traits, which requires a specialised framework to study its quantitative genetics. Here, we study growth in a squamate, the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara). We use two large datasets with available pedigree information: one from a wild population in a colder, montane environment; the other from an experimental population in a warmer, lowland environment. We found slower growth and larger asymptotic sizes in the colder population. We also found faster growth to lower asymptotic sizes for males. Inferences using a non-linear animal model show very low to moderate heritabilities in the parameters of individual growth curves, varying across populations and sexes. The decomposition of the additive genetic variance show a small to moderate heritability of the overall growth curves, with a stronger importance of the heritability in the shape of growth curves (variation in the dynamics of growth) than on their offset (variation between smaller and larger individuals). Genetic variation in growth curves differed between the two populations, with higher heritabilities in the experimental population. It also differed between sexes: there was more genetic variation in the growth rate at earlier ages for males, while genetic variation was larger for asymptotic size and at later ages for females. Our results tend to show that there is more adaptive potential in the earlier ages for males and in the later ages for females, which seems to be linked to their different life-history strategies. They also suggest that climate might have a positive impact on the adaptive potential of growth, which remains to be confirmed.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

A high level of type I FHB resistance was reported in an accession of wheat wild relative Triticum timopheevii. Hexaploid wheat-T. timopheevii introgression lines carrying a segment of the short arm of chromosome 3G (Chr3G) of this accession expressed high levels of FHB resistance following spray inoculation. Further analyses of these introgression lines showed that the Chr3G segment confers a potent type II resistance, accompanied by improved grain weight retention, and reduced deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation in grain. These results indicate that the Chr3G resistance has the potential to dramatically reduce FHB susceptibility and DON accumulation in grain in wheat cultivars. An introgression of a segment of Chr7At into the short arm of chromosome Chr7A also enhanced type II FHB resistance.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Thirteen organs and tissues from sheep (Ovis aries) were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based untargeted proteomics and lipidomics.

From an ultrahigh throughput screening dataset of >30,000 unique sequences paired with function data.

To address this, we developed CRISPR-rabies virus (CRV), which leverages the trans-synaptic spread of rabies virus to enable gene editing within anatomically defined neural circuits. By pairing CRV with cell type-specific Cas9 expression, we achieved targeted gene modifications in specific circuits. We demonstrate that CRV can modulate sodium and potassium channel expression in parvalbumin interneurons, thereby effectively regulating synaptic transmission of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Its compatibility with 3'-capture single-cell RNA-seq allows simultaneous circuit perturbation and molecular profiling.

Currently, genomic prediction is limited to numeric phenotypes. In some cases, though, plant and animal phenotypes are better understood through images and text rather than numbers. The current best practice for incorporating images and text in genomic prediction is to first extract scalar numeric phenotypes from images and text, and then to perform genomic prediction on the numeric phenotypes. While this approach is effective for some traits, it involves discarding most of the information in the image or text, including potentially useful information. Additionally, numeric phenotypes derived from images and text may not be as interpretable as the images and text themselves.\n\nApproachWe present a novel approach for predicting images and text from SNP markers, which we refer to as end-to-end genomic prediction, and validate this approach using genotypes, text, and image phenotypes derived from a strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) diversity panel. Our approach combines nonlinear latent space encoding with linear genomic prediction to generate accurate breeding values for a high-dimensional phenotype, for example, images or text.\n\nResultsFor both genome-to-image and genome-to-text prediction, we found that predicting images and text and then extracting numeric traits from them was in some cases as accurate as directly predicting extracted numeric phenotypes, demonstrating for the first time that genome-to-image prediction accuracy can be comparable to conventional genomic prediction accuracy.\n\nConclusionsBased on our proof-of-concept using the same core end-to-end method in both images and text, we believe end-to-end genomic prediction could be of use in a wide range of visual and multidimensional phenotypes in plants and animals, although further work to improve the accuracy of the embedding and genomic prediction steps is needed.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

K.; Roy, S.; Govind, R.", "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is an important nosocomial pathogen that has been classified as an urgent threat by the CDC. Antibiotic use is the primary risk factor for the development of C. difficile-associated disease because it disrupts healthy protective gut flora and enables C. difficile to colonize the colon. C. difficile damages host tissue by secreting toxins and disseminates by forming spores. Nutrient availability and other environmental factors greatly influence toxin production in C. difficile. CodY is a global transcriptional regulator that coordinates metabolism and virulence in Gram-positive pathogens in response to nutrient availability, primarily through sensing branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine; ILV) and GTP. In C. difficile, CodY indirectly represses toxin production by inhibiting transcription of the positive regulator tcdR and influences sporulation through unknown mechanisms. Here, we characterized two naturally occurring CodY variants, CodY(Y146N) and CodY(V58A). The Y146N substitution is located near the GTP-binding pocket, while V58A is near the ILV-binding site. Ligand binding assays revealed GTP binding ability of CodY(Y146N) is severely compromised. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that ligand binding differentially influenced promoter binding; in the presence of GTP, CodY(Y146N) bound to the tcdR promoter less efficiently than CodY(WT). In C. difficile, production of either variant resulted in reduced repression of toxin production compared to CodY(WT). Subsequent in vivo experiments in a hamster infection model showed that strains producing CodY(Y146N) or CodY(V58A) were significantly more virulent than the CodY(WT) strain. These findings demonstrate that a single amino acid change in this global regulator can alter its ligand affinity and promoter-binding properties to potentially rewire the gene regulatory networks to enhance the pathogenic potential in C. difficile.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

However, precise and high-throughput quantification of glutamate in physiological samples remains challenging. Here, we report an ultrasensitive and highly specific glutamate aptamer-based biosensor, or aptasensor, developed through in silico design and microfabrication, followed by in vitro and clinical validation. The biosensor consists of arrays of graphene field-effect transistors functionalized with a novel DNA aptamer, NG-Apt-Glu, designed and characterized computationally and biochemically, revealing two putative glutamate binding sites. The aptasensor detects glutamate in artificial cerebrospinal fluid with a 1 aM detection limit, a wide linear range (1 aM-10 pM), and 24 mV/decade sensitivity, showing strong selectivity against GABA, glutamine, dopamine, and serotonin. To evaluate clinical applicability, glutamate levels were measured in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Alzheimer's Disease, showing a significant increase relative to controls and correlating with neurofilament light chain concentrations, a biomarker of neuronal death. These findings underscore glutamate's involvement in Alzheimer's pathophysiology and its potential as a biomarker for neurodegeneration. This ultrasensitive graphene-based aptasensor enables point-of-care monitoring, paving the way for early diagnosis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

We illustrate the approach using a hierarchical reference dataset of 3,500 food items to derive dietary patterns from stool metabolomics data of omnivore and vegan participants. The analysis reveals clear dietary group separation, demonstrating how RDD metabolomics can extract biologically meaningful patterns from otherwise unannotated spectra.

H.; Ward, M.; Aviran, S.", "abstract": "The diverse regulatory functions, protein production capacity, and stability of natural and synthetic RNAs are closely tied to their ability to fold into intricate structures. Determining RNA structure is thus fundamental to RNA biology and bioengineering. Among existing approaches to structure determination, computational secondary structure prediction offers a rapid and low-cost strategy and is thus widely used, especially when seeking to identify functional RNA elements in large transcriptomes or screen massive libraries of novel designs. While traditional approaches rely on detailed measurements of folding energetics and/or probabilistic modeling of structural data, recent years have witnessed a surge in deep learning methods, inspired by their tremendous success in protein structure prediction. However, the limited diversity and volume of known RNA structures can impede their ability to accurately predict structures markedly different from the ones they have seen. This is known as the generalization gap and currently poses a major barrier to progress in the field. In this Perspective article, we gauge method generalizability using a new benchmark dataset of structured RNAs we curated from the Protein Data Bank. We also discuss the emergence of deep learning methods for predicting structure probing data and use a new dataset to underscore generalization challenges unique to this domain along with directions for future improvement. Expanding beyond improving predictive accuracy, we review how advances in deep learning have recently enabled scalable and accessible optimization of traditional structure prediction methods and their seamless integration with modern neural networks.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce AlgoraeOS, a biologically informed, attention-aware deep neural network designed to address these challenges. Trained on the largest harmonised dataset of experimentally tested drug combinations, AlgoraeOS simultaneously predicts multiple synergy metrics, while preserving their empirical correlations and accurately estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong out-of-distribution generalisability across diverse tissues and drug mechanisms, including rigorous zero-shot and few-shot evaluations. Notably, AlgoraeOS predicts the entire dose-response surface, providing dose-specific inhibition profiles with high precision and scalability to multi-million-point datasets. By integrating uncertainty aware, multi-metric, and dose-resolved prediction into a single unified framework, AlgoraeOS offers a powerful solution for drug combination discovery and establishes a new standard for model development and validation in the field.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

The APOE-R136S (Christchurch, CC) point mutation has been shown to protect against AD pathology and dementia, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this protection and its effects on -syn pathology are not well understood. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we created a CC arginine-to-serine point mutation at the conserved location in mouse APOE (R128S) to understand its effects on A{beta}, tau and -syn pathologies. We crossed these APOE CC mice to 5xFAD, PS19 and A53T-Syn-GFP (A53T) mice. Using these various double mutant mice, we tested the effect of mouse APOE CC on different proteinopathies, including A{beta}, tau, A{beta}-induced tau after paired helical filament (PHF)-tau intracortical injections, and -syn after preformed fibril (PFF) intracortical and intramuscular injections. We used immunohistochemical, biochemical and behavioral measures to test for protective effects of APOE CC on these different proteinopathies. Heterozygous (Het) and homozygous (Hom) APOE CC mice showed increased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as seen in humans, but no differences in body or brain weight, or life expectancy. APOE CC decreased A{beta}-induced tau pathologies in PHF-tau injected 5xFAD;Hom mice but did not change A{beta}-plaque pathology in 5xFAD mice or tau pathology in PS19 mice. Although A{beta} levels, tau levels and mouse sex correlated strongly with the behavioral performance, we only detected subtle effects of APOE CC on anxiety-like behaviors in crosses with 5xFAD, PS19 and PHF-tau injected 5xFAD mice. Interestingly, Het and Hom APOE CC mice both showed reduced formation and spread of Lewy pathology in brain after intracortical -syn PFF injection and reduced formation in spinal cord after -syn PFF injection into the hindlimb gastrocnemius muscle in A53T mice. Our study emphasizes the protective effects of the APOE CC variant against different proteinopathies important for dementia and movement disorders, including A{beta} plaque, tau and -syn, and suggests that targeting APOE CC could provide new therapeutic strategies for AD, DLB and PD.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

The polycystins likely function as a complex in the primary cilium, yet previous work hinted at a critical role for PC1 function outside of the primary cilium (extra-ciliary) during tubule development. Here, we investigate an extra-ciliary role for the polycystins in regulating renal cell and tubular morphology. First, we found acute loss of polycystins significantly increased the circularity of renal epithelial cells and tubuloids grown in 3D culture. Next, we demonstrated that both PC1 and PC2 can immunoprecipitate Ezrin, an ERM protein important for apical compartment shape. In human ADPKD renal cystic tissue, and after acute inducible knockout of Pkd1 or Pkd2, we found that Ezrin protein abundance is significantly reduced, with the remaining Ezrin protein mis-localized. Immunofluorescence in 2D cells and 3D tubuloids suggested acute polycystin loss specifically reduced the active form of Ezrin at the apical surface, leaving inactive Ezrin colocalized with ZO1 in the cell junctions. A specific ERM phosphorylation inhibitor, NSC668394, phenocopied the increased circularity observed in the Pkd1 knockout spheroids, as did inhibition of PKC activity, implicating the polycystin complex in regulating Ezrin phosphorylation. Our data strongly support a role for the polycystin complex in regulating renal cell and tubular shape via interactions with the ERM protein Ezrin, interactions that do not require trafficking to the primary cilium.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

The extent of this deficiency, the specific DC subsets affected , and the causative mechanisms remain undefined. Furthermore, DCs in other brain tumors have not been systematically investigated. Methods: High-parameter flow cytometry was used to profile circulating and intra-tumoral DCs in patients with glioblastoma, low-grade gliomas, and brain metastases, and non-CNS cancers. Plasma DC growth factors were quantified using ELISA. We also evaluated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets to compare intra-tumoral DCs in brain and lung tumors, and quantified DC number and phenotype in three intracranial mouse brain tumor models. Results: Our studies reveal a profound systemic reduction of multiple DC subsets in the blood of patients with diverse brain tumors, coupled with reduced DC activation marker expression and lower plasma levels of FLT3L and G-CSF. Furthermore, scRNAseq analyses revealed reduced intra-tumoral DCs in glioblastoma compared to lung tumors. Circulating DC numbers inversely correlated with perioperative corticosteroid dose in patients with or without a brain tumor. However, brain tumor patients not receiving corticosteroids also had reduced DCs, suggesting a direct effect of the brain tumor. This was supported by our observation of systemic DC defects in mouse brain tumor models.

Following the imaging process, three different DNA extraction methods with different levels of sample destruction were tested. ESEM imaging showed that there were no visual differences between specimens that underwent drying treatments and ones that were not dried. No significant differences in DNA yield were observed for drying treatments and extraction methods post extraction. However, extraction methods demonstrated significant differences in yield of PCR products. Sequenced PCR products aligned with 100% identity to the C. rufifacies mitochondrial genome reference sequence.

Plants with reduced levels of microRNA156 or increased expression of its downstream targets, the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE genes SPL3, SPL4, and SPL13 exhibited accelerated heading time, with stronger effects under suboptimal inductive conditions. Earlier heading was associated with the upregulation of miR172 and flowering-promoting genes VRN1, FUL2, and FT1 and the downregulation of flowering-repressing genes AP2L1 and VRN2. Additionally, we uncovered complex interactions among SPL, SQUAMOSA (VRN1 and FUL2), and DELLA proteins that modulate wheat heading time. We showed that DELLA proteins, which are negative regulators in the gibberellic acid pathway, can interact with SPL proteins reducing their ability to induce flowering. We also discovered previously unknown interactions between SQUAMOSA and DELLA proteins in wheat that compete with the DELLA-SPL interactions, likely reducing DELLA ability to repress SPL3 and SPL4 activity. Since SPL3 and SPL4 directly promote VRN1 and FUL2 transcription, these interactions generate a positive regulatory feedback loop that accelerates wheat heading time.

However, the temporal dynamics of how different evaluative tasks modulate pupil size remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how pupillary responses vary when observers evaluate the same set of object images for either glossiness or attractiveness. These two perceptual attributes were selected to exemplify distinct cognitive demands: one rooted in surface-level visual analysis and the other involving emotional valuation. The stimuli consisted of 60 grayscale object photographs selected from the THINGS database, representing common real-world items without social or facial content. Low-level image statistics were controlled using histogram matching to equalize luminance and contrast across all stimuli. Participants viewed each image for 3000 ms while maintaining central fixation and rated either its glossiness or attractiveness on a 7-point scale in separate task blocks. Ground-average waveforms revealed task-dependent modulations of pupil size across rating levels, consistent with prior reports that pupillary responses vary with evaluative context even for identical stimuli. Using temporal principal component analysis and generalized additive modeling, we found that higher glossiness ratings were associated with greater pupil constriction at early, light-reflex-like latencies, whereas higher attractiveness ratings elicited greater pupil dilation at later time points. These findings suggest that distinct temporal profiles of pupil size reflect task-specific processing demands, potentially aligning with the notion that visual and affective evaluations may unfold in temporally distinct stages, as suggested in prior theoretical models. Our results underscore the value of pupillometry as a non-invasive tool for dissociating task-dependent perceptual processes, with potential applications in cognitive neuroscience and affective computing.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "We present mdBIRCH, an online clustering method that adapts the BIRCH CF-tree to molecular dynamics (MD) data by using a merge test calibrated directly to RMSD. Each arriving frame is routed to the nearest centroid and added only if the post-merge radius computed from the cluster feature remains within a user-supplied threshold. This keeps the average deviation to each cluster centroid bounded as the cluster grows and preserves a simple interpretation of resolution in physical units. We evaluate mdBIRCH on a {beta}-heptapeptide and the HP35 system. We propose two protocols to make the threshold selection easier: (a) RMSD-anchored runs that use controlled structural edits to define interpretable operating points and (b) blind sweep that tracks how cluster count, occupancy, and coverage change with the threshold. In both systems, increasing the threshold reduces the number of clusters, concentrates coverage in high-occupancy states, and broadens within-cluster RMSD distributions. Furthermore, because decisions rely only on cluster summaries, mdBIRCH completely avoids the need for pairwise distance matrices, scales near-linearly with the number of frames on standard hardware, and naturally supports incremental operation. The method offers a practical combination of speed and interpretability for large-scale trajectory analysis.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) accounts for 5-25% of OC and its incidence rate is rising. Liver metastasis is particularly high in OCCC patients and leads to significantly reduced median survival. Why OCCC metastasizes to liver at such high frequency remains elusive. We previously identified MEX3A as a key factor that promotes OCCC tumorigenesis in part by circumventing p53-mediated ferroptosis. Here, we report that MEX3A control of mitochondrial fitness, which occurs independently of p53, is essential for OCCC primary tumor growth and liver metastasis. MEX3A depletion resulted in chronic mitochondrial fragmentation and accumulation of non-functional mitochondria. MEX3A-depleted cells had decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased superoxide and decreased NAD+/NADH ratio, resulting in inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and decreased ATP levels. In an environment enriched with mitophagy stressors, such as the liver, MEX3A-depleted OCCC cells had greatly reduced survival due to failure to recover from mitophagy. Consistent with these observations, MEX3A knockdown greatly reduced liver metastasis. Together, these data demonstrate that MEX3A-mediated mitochondrial fitness is a major factor underlying its p53-independent promotion of OCCC tumorigenesis and liver metastasis. Thus, targeting MEX3A will be a promising strategy to inhibit OCCC progression.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

However, comprehensive validation of their concordance in mutation detection and variant allele frequency (VAF) quantification across heterogeneous sample types remains limited. Inconsistent results from different sample types (e.g., cfDNA, FFPE) pose a significant challenge to clinical decisions. This is particularly critical for advanced NSCLC patients, who often rely on liquid biopsy, yet the concordance between liquid and tissue-based testing lacks validation in large-scale studies. Another issue in clinical practice is that many tumor samples are limited in quantity, making it difficult to meet testing requirements. Therefore, it is worth exploring whether pre-capture NGS libraries can serve as substitutes for original DNA. Methods: In this study, we first developed three assays to detect EGFR L858R, exon 19 deletions (Ex19del) and T790M, respectively using ddPCR platform. Their Limit of Detection (LOD) could reach 0.01% at 100 ng of input DNA. Subsequently, we conducted a large retrospective clinical study to systematically compare the detection performance of ddPCR and NGS across three mutation types using approximately 1,000 EGFR-positive samples, including cell-free DNA (cfDNA), pre-capture NGS libraries of cfDNA (cfDNA-prePCR), FFPE-derived DNA (ffpeDNA), pre-capture NGS libraries of FFPE-derived DNA (ffpeDNA-prePCR), fresh tumor tissue DNA (ttDNA), pre-capture NGS libraries of ttDNA (ttDNA-prePCR), pleural effusion supernatants DNA (peDNA), and pre-capture NGS libraries of peDNA (peDNA-prePCR). They were analyzed for detection concordance and VAF correlation. Especially, we made comparisons of the tumor DNA, including ctDNA and tumor tissue DNA , with their paired pre-capture NGS library. Results: Key findings demonstrated excellent overall agreement between NGS and ddPCR. The mutation detection concordance rates were 98.72% (overall), with subtype-specific rates of 98.93% (L858R), 99.23% (Ex19del), and 97.14% (T790M). VAF measurements between ddPCR and NGS showed exceptional correlation (Pearson's r = 0.975, P<0.001). Notably, pre-capture NGS libraries showed remarkable VAF concordance with their source materials (0.993 for cfDNA libraries vs cfDNA; 0.998 for tumor tissue libraries vs tumor DNA with EGFR L858R; 0.991 for tumor tissue libraries vs tumor DNA with EGFR Ex19del). Conclusions: NGS and ddPCR demonstrate high concordance in EGFR mutation detection and VAF quantification, supporting their complementary roles in clinical testing. Using pre-capture libraries as an alternative to source samples can avoid repeat biopsies and enables subsequent testing for patients with inadequate FFPE sample quantity. These findings establish an evidence base for integrated diagnostic paradigms leveraging NGS's multiplexing power and ddPCR's sensitivity.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

H.; Sashindranath, M.", "abstract": "Disruption of the pulmonary endothelium by drugs, toxins, viruses (e.g., COVID-19), or bacterial sepsis can cause acute pulmonary vasculopathy leading to pulmonary hypertension and consequential heart failure. CD39 is a membrane-anchored ecto-enzyme expressed on endothelial cells (EC), integral in maintaining the antithrombotic profile of the endothelium. This ecto-enzyme works in concert with CD73 to hydrolyze both eATP (pro-inflammatory) and ADP (pro-thrombotic) ultimately to adenosine, which is anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and antithrombotic. CD39 activity and adenosine signalling are disrupted in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In this work, we explored the efficacy of endothelial cell-targeted delivery of CD39 to prevent the development of acute toxin-induced PAH in a mouse model. We generated a novel therapeutic anti-VCAM-CD39 containing an scFv recognising VCAM-1 (a receptor expressed on activated EC) fused to the soluble form of extracellular human CD39. In a mouse model of endothelial cell-toxin-induced PAH, we show that a single administration of anti-VCAM-CD39 (0.4 mg/kg IV) prevented the development of PAH- as reflected in the preservation of right ventricular systolic pressures and the absence of right ventricular hypertrophy at day 10 when compared with controls. This protection is conferred by multiple mechanisms: IL-10-driven potentiation of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, a known inhibitor of smooth muscle proliferation; VCAM-1 blockade reduces leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium; and cytoprotective effects through adenosine signalling. Thus, anti-VCAM-CD39 is a novel bifunctional therapeutic strategy for PAH.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

However, empirical support for such functional reorganization processes, especially in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), is limited. To delineate precise sensory representations of the back and test for altered somatotopic processing in CLBP, we utilized an MR-compatible pneumatic vibration device and applied frequency-specific vibrotactile stimuli (20 Hz and 80 Hz) at nine thoracolumbar paraspinal sites in 45 patients with CLBP and 41 healthy controls. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was employed via a whole-brain searchlight method, and the neural representational patterns were contrasted against theoretical models including a segmental (based on anatomical proximity), simple (upper vs. lower back division) and a random model. In addition, a machine learning classifier was trained to predict afferent input from the upper vs lower back in healthy controls and tested in CLBP patients. Both groups displayed well-organized segmental representations spanning somatosensory, motor, and posterior parietal cortices. Posterior parietal regions exhibited the best model fits, followed by S1. No evidence for differences in representational patterns between groups was found. In CLBP patients, these patterns did not show associations with pain duration, severity, fear of movement or self-reported back perception. The classifier, trained on healthy controls, accurately predicted upper vs lower back afferent input in CLBP patients. These findings indicate preserved cortical maps of the back in CLBP, challenging the hypothesis of sensory cortical reorganization in this condition.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

We analyze electrophysiological recordings of mouse visual cortex to examine whether within-session representational drift is consistent with this principle. Within-session representational drift was not explained by changes in behavioral state. Instead, it showed a systematic temporal structure that reflected sensory experience rather than behavior. Drift for a given set of stimuli accelerated during blocks presenting that set of stimuli and slowed down during blocks in which other stimuli were presented. Thus, sensory inputs, not elapsed time, organize representational drift in a stimulus-specific manner, consistent with theoretical predictions for training neural networks.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

In this study, we present ECLIPSE, a systems-level framework for compound/ligand-protein interaction (CPI) representation and prediction, combining heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs), which encode large-scale entity-relation structure, with graph neural networks that exploit relational inductive biases to perform inference on graph-structured data. ECLIPSE uses our comprehensive biomedical KG-based platform, CROssBAR, incorporating genes/proteins, drugs, compounds, pathways, diseases, and phenotypes, along with their multi-layered relationships. Each entity is assigned input features derived from language or graph representation learning models and projected via type-specific neural network layers. To process these featurized biomedical KGs for bioactivity prediction, we employed the heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) architecture. In contrast to the majority of GNN algorithms, which are restricted to homogenous graphs, HGT can handle graph heterogeneity and maintain node- and edge-type dependent representations through its attention mechanism. ECLIPSE achieves strong performance on challenging, protein-family-specific CPI benchmarks compared with baseline and state-of-the-art methods; ablations confirm performance gains from modelling graph heterogeneity and all feature sources. Use-case analyses on a druggable kinase (PIM1) and a historically undruggable receptor (HER3) illustrate generalizability across target classes and activity ranges.

Here, we present an AI-driven framework for the rational identification of tissue specific E3 ligases suitable for precision-targeted degradation. Our model leverages a BERT-based protein language architecture trained on billions of sequences to generate contextual embeddings that capture structural and functional motifs relevant for E3 substrate compatibility.

Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a leading cause of chronic low back pain and disability. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying disc degeneration is crucial for developing effective therapies. Sheep have emerged as a promising large-animal model for IVDD research due to their similarities with humans. They exhibit resembling spine anatomy and biomechanics, and they develop spontaneous age-associated degeneration of the disc. However, the specific cellular alterations occurring in annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) ovine cells during degeneration remain poorly characterized. In vitro, the benefits of using cells from aged sheep over young ones to mimic degenerative processes remain to be tested. Methods. AF and NP cells from young and aged sheep were analysed using bulk RNA sequencing, with a focus on two hallmarks of IVDD: cellular senescence and metabolic alterations. Functional assays completed this focus by assessing cells response under basal conditions and after pro-degenerative stimuli (IL-1{beta}, senescence induction). In addition, bulk transcriptomic data were deconvoluted using a reference single-cell RNA-seq dataset from healthy and degenerated human discs, and gene co-expression modules were compared across species. Results. MRI and histological analyses revealed homogeneous mild degeneration across all lumbar discs in aged sheep, while lamb discs were uniformly healthy. Cells transcriptomic profiling identified robust age- and tissue-specific signatures, with aged NP and AF cells showing upregulation of inflammatory mediators, ECM-remodelling enzymes, and senescence-associated pathways. Cross-species analysis revealed shared transcriptional modules between aged sheep cells and human degenerated disc cells, supporting the translational relevance of the ovine model. Remarkably, young and aged cells shared a similar functional behaviour when exposed to stress-related stimuli. Conclusions. This work confirms the compatibility of sheep cells with in vitro testing and their relevance to model human IVDD. Cross-validation with human single-cell data further highlights common pathogenic pathways, reinforcing the translational potential of the model.

We investigate the extent of seasonal elevational migration for birds that are present year-round in the tallest mountains of the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, the Nilgiris. We combined rigorously curated participatory science data with systematic field surveys. We estimated the elevational shifts of 70 bird species between the hottest and coldest quarters in the eastern Nilgiris. We ran regression models to quantify the associations between these shifts and their suspected drivers. Around 70% of the species in the region shifted in their elevational ranges, and the frequency of these shifts was higher at lower and mid-elevations. Downslope shifts were positively associated with a narrow thermal range and species lower temperature limit, while the opposite associations were observed for upslope shifts. We suspect species might be tracking their thermal regimes, and the temperature limits of species can be a major driver of elevational migration in the Nilgiris. The predominance of partial elevational migration in the region provides opportunities for testing theories on biotic drivers of these movements in the future. We highlight the combined usage of field and participatory science in examining ecological patterns in understudied parts of the world.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

However, most studies addressing global-change impacts focus on a very limited number of environmental variables, taxa, and ecosystem functions. Evidence is mounting that many belowground ecosystems are subject to an underappreciated aspect of global change: the invasion of earthworms. While we know that earthworm invasion can impact the physical, chemical, and biological properties of invaded ecosystems, it remains poorly understood how these changes are interconnected and how they concurrently affect the overall functioning of an ecosystem. To fill this gap, we collected data on six environmental variables, ten functional groups of microbes, plants, and animals, and 16 ecosystem functions from four forests in the USA and Canada, well-known hotspots of earthworm invasion. We used a multi-step Structural-Equation Modeling approach to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of earthworm invasion on environmental conditions and the ecosystem multidiversity and multifunctionality of invaded forests at different levels of resolution. Our analysis revealed that earthworm invasion reduced total multidiversity (combined microbial, plant, and animal multidiversity). Ecosystem multifunctionality was reduced via a combination of direct and indirect effects, with the latter involving both effects mediated by altered environmental conditions and by total multidiversity. In contrast, when resolving total multidiversity into taxon-specific multidiversity indices for microbes, plants, and animals, the above-mentioned effects of earthworm invasion on multifunctionality via multidiversity disappeared. Invasion effects on single ecosystem functions differed in their mediators but were net negative across the board. Given these differences across the differently-resolved analyses, the results suggest that a whole-ecosystem perspective is paramount to comprehensively understanding the impacts of biological invasions. Combining a multi-step analytical design with multiple biodiversity indices and multiple ecosystem functions assessed at the same time and place, our study represents the most complete assessment of the mechanisms and ecosystem-level consequences of earthworm invasion to date.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

However, the role of tree microbial associations for this key trait remains largely unclear. In this study, we investigated how geographic origin, species identity, and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) shape the rhizosphere microbiome and root-rhizosphere metabolome of pedunculate (Quercus robur) and sessile (Q. petraea) oaks. In a six-year common garden experiment, we analyzed trees from both species, each grown from seeds from two distinct geographic origins, the upper Rhine basin (URB) and the north-east German lowlands (NGL), differing in water availability, using 16S and ITS rRNA gene based metabarcoding and untargeted metabolomics. We found a consistent legacy effect of seed origin on the composition of the prokaryotic rhizosphere microbiome and the metabolome, whereas tree species had no significant impact. The bacterial family Pseudonocardiaceae was enriched at trees from the drier origin NGL, while Blastocatellaceae and Micromonosporaceae were positively associated with iWUE across samples. Higher iWUE was furthermore significantly correlated with lower prokaryotic diversity and shifts in beta-diversity, thereby linking a drought-adaptive host trait to the assembly of the belowground environment. Ellagic acid, a plant derived polyphenol associated with drought tolerance, was enriched in the drier origin NGL and linked to several prokaryotic taxa in correlation networks. The rhizosphere fungal community, however, was largely unaffected by origin or species. Solely fungal community evenness declined with increasing iWUE. Together, our findings suggest that ecotypic adaptation linked to origin can outweigh the effect of species-level traits in shaping the oak rhizosphere microbiome and metabolome. These findings emphasize that provenance-driven ecotypic adaptation can strongly influence plant-microbe interactions and underscore the need for provenance-aware selection and microbiome-informed assisted migration as strategies to strengthen forest drought resilience under global climate change.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

O.; Oka, K.; Sakakibara, Y.; Hotta, K.", "abstract": "Background Ascidiella aspersa is an invasive tunicate, one of the closest relatives of vertebrates. Despite its ecological nuisance, A. aspersa is anticipated to be a valuable model organism for developmental studies due to its remarkably transparent embryos. However, annotated genome assemblies and transcriptomic resources have not yet been fully established. Although several tunicate genomes have been sequenced, most lack annotations, and a comprehensive analysis across tunicates has not yet been conducted. Results We performed de novo genome assembly and transcriptome analysis of A. aspersa, producing a high-quality 306.5 Mb genome assembly. The transcriptome was derived from nine different organs of adults and embryos at six developmental stages. Ab initio and homology-based gene predictions identified 24,504 genes as part of the KAS25 gene model with a BUSCO score of 92.2%. Functional annotation was added for 18,636 genes in the model. To understand the relative features of this species among tunicates, we conducted genome-wide comparative analysis using publicly available data from 35 other tunicate genomes across three classes, five orders, and 12 families, constructing gene models for 27 species with BUSCO scores >80%. Overall, Phylogenetic analysis revealed a new hypothesis regarding the relationships among Phlebobranchia and Aplousobranchia families. Gene duplication analysis showed distinct contractions of gene families in some taxa, with losses of specific DNA repair related genes that were shared among Thaliacea, which may have contributed to their evolutionary diversification. Tunicate genomes exhibited a high level of variation in genomic GC content (28.0% to 42.7%). A. aspersa has the highest GC content in coding regions and the third position of codons among tunicate species, with changes in codon usage bias differing from other Ascidiidae species. We also constructed an online comparative tunicate genome database (TUNOME), that provide functional annotations of gene models and ortholog analyses based on these genomic and transcriptomic data. Conclusions We constructed genomic resources for A. aspersa and another 35 tunicate gene models. Comparative analysis reveals a variety in tunicate species genomes and characterizes class-level features. Our resources are expected to serve as a foundation for experimental studies involving non-model tunicates and for comparative analysis among tunicate species.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

For example, during migration in narrow spaces, or in solid tumors, cells and their nuclei experience confinement which they sense and respond to. Emerging evidence identifies the genome as a central mediator of these responses, dynamically reorganizing its three-dimensional (3D) structure to regulate both short- and long-term gene expression programs, enabling cellular adaptation to mechanical constraints. However, the mechanisms underlying such responses, especially those linking the 3D genome and transcriptome, are unknown. Here, we utilize controlled cell confinement followed by Hi-C and transcriptome analyses to map and model temporal responses to mechano-confinement in the 3D genome. We identify clusters of genes (termed \"TECs\") exhibiting coordinated temporal transcriptional responses tied to their differential radial positioning within the nucleus. Additionally, we uncover a genome-wide, partially reversible response, wherein chromosomes reposition under confinement to enhance select genome compartments, aligning with temporal gene regulation patterns. Specifically, one such cluster, TEC7, is linked to 3D genome restructuring and nuclear translocation of NF-{kappa}B, driving cytokine expression and secretion. Our findings reveal how 3D genome reorganization and transcriptional programs can drive mechanoresponses, opening up for new views into the mechanisms of mechanogenomic regulation in health and disease.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

F.; Seretny, A.", "abstract": "Objective: Primary liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and harbors recurrent mutations in chromatin regulators such as BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), yet their functional impact remains unclear. We investigated how BAP1 deficiency affects liver homeostasis and tumorigenesis to clarify its functional role. Design: We employed inducible, liver-specific BAP1 knockdown in mice subjected to diet-induced metabolic stress (including rescue experiments), alongside autochthonous hydrodynamic CRISPR models, and profiled livers by RNA-seq, immunohistochemistry, and mass spectrometry-based lipidomics. Complementary mechanistic assays in liver cancer cells examined the unfolded protein response (UPR) under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress; findings were supported by immunohistochemical and transcriptomic analyses of BAP1-mutant patient samples. Results: BAP1 safeguards liver homeostasis under diet-induced metabolic stress, as its loss triggers ER stress, hepatocyte death, and acute liver failure. Lipidomics revealed a shift toward ER-stress-associated dyslipidemia, and transcriptomics showed negative enrichment of fatty-acid metabolism and positive enrichment of UPR pathways. In contrast, BAP1 loss synergizes with oncogenic drivers to accelerate tumorigenesis in autochthonous liver cancer models, underscoring its context-dependent tumor suppressor function. Mechanistically, BAP1 directly regulates the ER stress mediator DDIT3 (CHOP) through chromatin remodeling, linking BAP1 loss to maladaptive stress responses. Consistently, elevated CHOP expression was observed in BAP1-mutant human liver cancers and other tumor types. Conclusion: These findings establish BAP1 as a key chromatin regulator that connects stress adaptation to both liver homeostasis and tumorigenesis, highlighting the BAP1-UPR axis for future translational assessment.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Profiling urinary proteomes from 1,215 individuals across three cohorts and integrating whole-genome sequencing from >500 participants to map genotype-proteome associations, we identified 177 urinary proteins associated with pathogenic LRRK2, enriched for lysosomal/glycosphingolipid, immune, and membrane-trafficking pathways.

Objectives: Determine how ACh dynamics are altered by dopamine under normal and parkinsonian conditions following acute and chronic L-DOPA treatment. Methods: We used fiber photometry to record fluorescent DA and ACh sensors in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of normal mice treated with vehicle or amphetamine and in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of mice with unilateral substantia nigra (SNc) DA neuron lesions (using 6-OHDA) subjected to an L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) protocol. Results: Under normal conditions, ACh exhibited transient increases followed by pauses and fluctuated at ~1-Hz frequency in an anti-correlated manner to DA. Amphetamine treatment reduced the frequency of ACh fluctuations and amplitude of ACh transients while prolonging after-transient pauses. In 6-OHDA-lesioned mice, ACh dynamics oscillated at a higher frequency and ACh events had reduced peaks and pauses. L-DOPA increased DA and, after repeated treatments, also reduced ACh. However, L-DOPA neither restored the anti-correlation between DA and ACh nor normalized the reduced ACh transient and pause amplitudes or the increased frequency of ACh fluctuations. In extended recordings during the transition to the L-DOPA OFF state, ACh remained low as DA diminished, and ACh transient and pause amplitudes remained suppressed and the oscillatory frequency elevated. Conclusions: Dopamine depletion transforms striatal ACh dynamics and L-DOPA fails to normalize these dynamics. Because these dynamics are unresponsive to treatment, new therapies targeting them may offer symptomatic improvements for PD and LID.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Where and how this transformation emerges along the somatosensory axis from peripheral proprioceptive receptors remains unclear. We simultaneously recorded many lumbosacral spinal neurons in two decerebrate, immobilized cats while a robotic device held the hindlimb at 16 static endpoint positions spanning hip-knee configurations. Using high-density multielectrode recordings, we asked how spinal populations encode static limb state. At the single-neuronal level, activities in a majority of neurons covaried with a single joint's angle (hip or knee), a smaller subset showed combined modulation by both joints, and a distinct subset ('single-endpoint'neurons) fired selectively at one unique hip-knee configuration near the sampled joint-range limits and was quiescent in adjacent postures. Population analyses revealed a low-dimensional structure: the first two principal components tracked knee and hip angles, respectively, whereas a third component isolated a boundary-aligned, posture-specific pattern, with loadings peaking at the same extreme configurations preferred by single-endpoint neurons. Decoders trained on ensemble activity reconstructed both joint angles and the limb's endpoint position in body-centered coordinates, indicating that the recorded spinal-interneuron populations contain sufficient information to reconstruct whole-limb kinematics. Together, these findings are consistent with a hierarchical organization whereby joint-based representations within spinal-interneuron populations could contribute to the emergence of limb-centered representations in the ascending proprioceptive pathways. The boundary preference of single-endpoint neurons supports a possible categorical coding scheme at workspace limits that may provide spinal ''landmarks'' for switching control modes, enhancing stability near kinematic extremes, and supporting recalibration of proprioceptive population codes.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Traditionally, masking is assessed through behavioral methods, witch requires active participant engagement. This study investigates the potential of using Auditory Steady-State Response (ASSR) to assess auditory masking, enabling masking assessment without requiring active participation. ASSRs were measured in response to a 40-Hz amplitude-modulated probe signal with and without the presence of a masker. The probe signals were 1/3-octave bandwidth Gaussian noise centered at 891 and 1414 Hz (center frequency, CF) and presented at 10, 20, 30, and 40 dB above individual behavioral masking thresholds (MT). The masker was lowpass Gaussian noise (cut-off 707 Hz) presented at 65 and 85 dB SPL (masker level, ML). The ASSR amplitude increased with presentation level (PL) and decreased in the presence of a masker, confirming a masking effect on ASSR. At 65 dB ML, ASSRs did not differ between center frequencies when probe signals were presented relative to MT, suggesting a simple relationship between MT and ASSR.

Enhancing innate immunity represents a promising adjunctive strategy to conventional antibiotic therapy. Bacterial flagellin, a Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist, has been shown to stimulate innate immune defenses when delivered via the respiratory route, demonstrating efficacy in both preventing and treating bacterial pneumonia in murine models. This protective effect is primarily mediated through TLR5-driven activation of airway epithelial cells. This study aimed to characterize the immunomodulatory effects of flagellin on human primary respiratory epithelium. Using the MucilAir air-liquid interface model and RNA sequencing, we demonstrated that apical administration of flagellin induced robust immune responses in airway epithelium derived from healthy individuals, as well as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). TLR5-mediated epithelial signaling triggered key immune-related pathways, including cytokine production, leukocyte chemotaxis, neutrophil recruitment, and antimicrobial defense, with strong commonalities across healthy and diseased airway epithelia. Furthermore, we demonstrated that flagellin effectively activated epithelial immune responses even in the presence of the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, epithelial activation alone was insufficient to directly limit bacterial colonization or replication, highlighting the potential role of epithelial-immune cell interactions in achieving effective bacterial clearance. These findings support TLR5 activation as a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance host defense mechanisms and improve treatment outcomes for bacterial pneumonia in both healthy individuals and patients with COPD or CF.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Cell imaging analysis shows that ORP5 stabilizes PA levels at MAM to promote TAG synthesis.

Here, we have utilized Drosophila melanogaster and human somatic cells as experimental models to shed light on their mode-of-action. Fly germ cells lacking dTorsin are arrested in development and display defects in the final steps of NPC biogenesis due to a failure in fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes. Using proximity labelling of Torsin1A in human cells, we identify the conserved membrane protein chloride channel CLIC-like protein 1 (CLCC1) as a novel Torsin binding partner. Absence of human CLCC1 or its Drosophila homolog dClcc1 phenocopied the membrane fusion defects at NPC assembly sites observed upon Torsin deletion. Furthermore, CLCC1 is enriched at arrested fusion sites, suggesting it to be a candidate for the elusive NE membrane fusogen. Importantly, CLCC1/dClcc1 overexpression is sufficient to rescue NPC biogenesis and developmental defects associated with Torsin-loss-of-function.

Here, we present the first validated deep learning approach using an attention-augmented 3D U-Net architecture to segment the adult zebrafish (Daino rerio) mandible. The network was trained on a dataset of 47 manually segmented specimens and evaluated using a novel combined Dice-Hausdorff metric that integrates both volumetric and surface accuracy to capture morphology. To assess model performance in practical biomechanical contexts, we compared automated segmentations to those produced by three expert human annotators and constructed finite element (FE) models from each segmentation. Comparisons of Dice-Hausdorff metrics and statistical analyses of FE outputs demonstrates that automated models perform within the range of human segmentations. This framework establishes a generalisable pipeline linking geometric and mechanical validation for biological image analysis.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Y.; Mogilner, A.; Oelz, D. B.", "abstract": "Bundles of actin filaments with similar positions and orientations commonly occur in cytoskeletal networks. We use mathematical modelling and simulation to investigate how filament turnover and mechanics influence contractility and bundle formation in disordered actomyosin networks. Using a two-dimensional agent-based model for an actomyosin network, we investigate four simplified models for filament turnover: uniform, biased, branching, and treadmilling. With no turnover, over time contractility decreases and bundle formation increases, and networks eventually form stationary patterns that cannot contract. Introducing turnover allows contractility to persist longer compared to the no-turnover scenario. Uniform turnover, where new filaments have random positions and orientations, disrupts bundle formation and enables persistent contractility. In biased turnover, branching, and treadmilling, the positions and orientations of new filaments depend on the existing network. These non-uniform turnover models increase bundle formation compared to uniform turnover, while still allowing long-term contractility. Branching at 70 degrees disrupts bundle formation to enable prolonged contractility, whereas filament treadmilling disrupts the trade-off between bundle formation and contractility. Biased turnover places new filaments near existing ones, which promotes bundle formation but is less effective at maintaining contractility. We also varied mechanical factors in our simulations, especially filament bending flexibility and protein friction, which enhance bundle formation and contractility, respectively. Our results suggest that variations in turnover and mechanics might allow cells to tune contractility and bundle formation in disordered actomyosin networks.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

A total of 128 healthy human adults (92 females) aged 20-83 (mean 39) years performed an allocentric working memory task during fMRI, in which object-location bindings had to be learned, maintained, and manipulated across an 8 second delay. The design included a staircase procedure to balance task difficulty across participants and a passive viewing condition to control for perceptual and attentional demands. Across the full sample, anterior and mid hippocampal subregions and cortical MTL areas were engaged in all phases, showing study-related activation, widespread delay-phase deactivation with region-specific sustained responses, and posterior hippocampal and cortical MTL reactivation during test. Contrary to predictions, hippocampal and cortical MTL activation did not vary with performance among younger adults. Instead, differences emerged in a left temporoparietal cluster, potentially reflecting verbal encoding strategies. Older adults, relative to younger adults with the most comparable performance levels, showed lower anterior hippocampal activation and smaller correct-passive viewing differences in perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices.

Stimulation elevates miR-219 loading into Argonaute complexes without altering mature miR-219 levels, revealing a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism.

We found in general motility is severely impaired in strains carrying motY deletions and which express C-terminal periplasmic regions of MotD, compared with strains expressing MotB C-terminal counterparts. Motility in soft agar is slightly increased in strains expressing N-terminal MotB transmembrane domains and MotD C-terminal periplasmic plug, PGB, and extensions, but motility is severely impaired in {Delta}motY strains. Addition of the extended 24-residue C-terminus of MotB to the C-terminus of MotD does not significantly affect either motility or compensate for the deleterious effect of motY mutation, but does significantly increase motility in motY+ backgrounds. The soft agar motility results for organisms with wild type MotAB stators was not different from those with MotAB stators carrying 24 residue MotB C-terminal deletions; however, motility of these mutants was significantly lower in motY mutants compared to motY mutants expressing wild type MotAB stators. We discuss contributions of stator functional domains to motility and the effects of {Delta}motY deletion.

Ticks are important vectors of animal and human pathogens worldwide. Their host-seeking activity (questing) directly influences the risk of exposure to ticks and their pathogens, but the drivers of this behaviour are poorly understood. Here, the concurrent seasonal and diel variation in Ixodes ricinus questing behaviour was investigated, for the first time, by blanket dragging every four hours over a 24-hour sampling cycle each month, from January to December 2022. A predominantly nocturnal questing activity pattern was observed, moderated by seasonal moisture availability, being most evident in months with high saturation deficit. Generalised Linear Mixed Modelling predicted that the density of questing nymphs was positively associated with darkness, and negatively associated with saturation deficit, which interacted with soil temperature. The observed seasonal questing patterns are largely consistent with published data; however this is the first study to highlight the importance of nocturnal feeding at periods of high saturation deficit. These commonly overlooked daily rhythms and environmental moderators of tick behaviour have important implications for assessing the relative risk of exposure to ticks and their pathogens for different hosts, and for estimating abundance in scientific research and surveillance.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

This coupling promotes recruitment and activation of the Rho-GTPase ROP6 in response to auxin, whereas disruption of VLCFA synthesis or sphingolipid composition disperses PS and ROP6 nanodomains, impairing cytoskeletal reorganization and directional growth.

In plants, ppGpp signalling plays a role as a regulator of photosynthetic activity, which is important in acclimation to environmental stresses such as nitrogen limitation. However, the full range of stresses involving ppGpp signalling is not yet known. Here, we investigated the role of ppGpp accumulation in the acclimation of plants to high light. We found that the over-accumulation of ppGpp in transgenic lines that overexpress RSH3 (OX:RSH3) increases tolerance to high light intensity. Although ppGpp leads to higher non-photochemical energy dissipation (NPQ) than in wild-type plants, we show that NPQ is not critical for the enhanced high-light tolerance. Rather, our results show that ppGpp accumulation leads to broad changes in plant physiology that prime plants to resist and subsequently recover from high light exposure. ppGpp levels themselves also increase in response to high light exposure, suggesting that ppGpp signalling may play a physiological role in high light acclimation.

This study examined 33 patients with semantic dementia and 20 healthy controls using a comprehensive behavioral battery (word and picture versions of the Pyramid and Palm Trees Test and a word picture verification task) combined with multimodal neuroimaging, including voxel based morphometry, diffusion-weighted imaging, and resting-state fMRI.

METHODS: 21 participants watched a full-length horror movie while their eye-movements were recoded with eye tracker. Moment-to-moment intensity of sustained fear as well as the onsets of the jump scares (acute fear) were annotated and used to predict gaze parameters (fixation duration & counts, blink frequency, saccade amplitude, pupil size and intersubject synchronization of gaze position). RESULTS: Acute fear events led to shortening of fixation duration, suppression of blinking, as well as increase of fixation count, saccade amplitude, and pupil size. Sustained fear was in turn associated with increased pupil size and decrease in blinking and saccade amplitude. These effects remained significant when controlling for luminosity.

With a statistical physics approach, we provide experimental evidence of an effective male-male interaction. We find that individual speed fluctuations are strongly correlated in space, meaning that mosquitoes in close proximity tend to display similar deviations from the group average, effectively flying at a similar speed. We also prove that this correlation is not compatible with a random arrangement of individuals, indicating that an interaction process is at play.

Light is a particularly attractive trigger for contactless stimulation of hydrogels that can induce reversible morphological changes without damaging the fragile gels. To meet the varied needs of applications in microfluidics, soft robotics, biomedicine, and other fields, there is significant demand for novel valve designs that are highly tunable, miniaturizable, and respond quickly to stimuli while maintaining their function over many activation cycles. Additionally, it is crucial to develop a more quantitative understanding of the mechanics of valve operation in response to different stimuli, especially when active hydrogels are combined with other materials in multi-component devices. Here, stimuli-responsive valves are fabricated using active hydrogels deformed upon temperature changes and exposure to near-infrared radiation. Gold nanorods (AuNRs) acting as photothermal transducers are embedded inside N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), allowing local morphological changes in response to light with high spatiotemporal control. These changes are described precisely as a function of the valve's confinement, aspect ratio, and the parameters of the stimulus using quantitative image analysis, providing novel mechanistic insights. Changing the aspect ratio of the valves and the degree of confinement of the hydrogel causes valves to either open or close during heating and can be used to control the magnitude of their response to different stimuli. These varied morphological changes are due to local, inhomogeneous deformations of the gel. The use of light as a trigger enables local confinement of the valve, reversible opening and closing, and fast response times on the order of seconds. The valves are shown to withstand hydrostatic pressures of up to 18 kPa, providing high potential for biomedical applications where precise pressure control and quick switching between open and closed states is critical.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Yet, mechanisms by which gut microbiota shape immune responses remain elusive as taxonomic biomarkers have failed to generalize across multiple cohorts. In this study, we develop a taxonomy-agnostic framework to identify microbial biomarkers of ICI response and immune-related adverse event (irAE) occurrence from metagenomic sequencing. Applying this approach to four independent melanoma cohorts from clinical centers across the United States, we uncover gut microbial proteins produced by diverse bacterial taxa that consistently predict ICI response. Notably, we uncover a previously uncharacterized operon involved in cellular redox homeostasis that is encoded by different bacteria and reliably predicts irAE occurrence. We further validated the predictive power of this operon in a prospectively sequenced melanoma cohort. Our results demonstrate that taxa-agnostic microbial protein biomarkers are robust, generalizable, and provide a path towards pretreatment risk stratification for melanoma patients initiating ICI therapy.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

This study explores transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in low-density granulocytes (LDGs), a proinflammatory neutrophil subset expanded in SLE, focusing on NADPH oxidase (Nox) function and minor intron splicing. Methods: LDGs and normal-density neutrophils (NDGs) were isolated from SLE patients and healthy controls (HCs). CYBA (P22phox) expression was evaluated at transcript and protein levels. Nox activity was measured using luminol assays. Bulk RNA sequencing and rMATS software were used to assess alternative splicing, particularly of U12-type intron-containing genes. Results: CYBA expression was reduced in SLE LDGs (n=11) compared to SLE NDGs and HCs (n=6), with levels resembling those in chronic granulomatous disease neutrophils. SLE LDGs exhibited impaired Nox activity (n=7 SLE, n=12 HC). CYBA is a U12 intron-containing gene, and transcriptomic analysis revealed broad downregulation of this gene class in SLE LDGs, suggesting minor spliceosome dysfunction. rMATS analysis showed increased U12-type intron retention and widespread splicing defects, including exon skipping and mutually exclusive exon use, in genes such as GBP5, MAEA and STX10. These abnormalities were validated in an independent long-read RNA-seq dataset from SLE PBMCs. Importantly, splicing disruptions correlated with disease activity and autoantibody profiles. Conclusion: Impaired U12-dependent splicing may contribute to neutrophil dysfunction in SLE, potentially via defective oxidative burst and altered immune regulation. These findings highlight the minor spliceosome as a novel player in lupus pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Earthworms are key contributors to healthy and productive soils, yet their reliance on water makes them vulnerable to the increased frequency and severity of droughts predicted under climate change. To avoid desiccation, some earthworms induce aestivation, a period of reduced metabolism during which they coil up and seal themselves into a chamber until conditions improve. However, the environmental conditions that trigger aestivation remain poorly understood. Here the responses of Allolobophora chlorotica, a common UK earthworm, to gradual air drying (at 15 {+/-} 1 {degrees}C) were examined in four soils differing in texture. Earthworm activity (active or aestivating) and mass change relative to initial values (pre- and post- 24 hours hydration) were measured at three gravimetric moisture contents (~19.7, 15.55 and 12.39 wt%) and three water potentials (~pF 1.59, 2.92 and 4.05). Water potential, rather than bulk water content, was the strongest predictor of behaviour. All earthworms remained active and gained ~36-53 % mass at the highest water availability (~pF 1.59), but 100 % aestivated at the lowest (~pF 4.05) in all but the sandiest soil. In contrast, responses at equal gravimetric moisture contents varied by soil type. All individuals in the clay aestivated and lost up to ~45 % mass, whereas those in sand and sandy loam soil largely remained active and gained mass. Differences likely reflect textural constraints on movement and the construction of aestivation chambers, which were fragile in sandy soils but more robust in clay-rich soils. After 24 hours of hydration, all earthworms had increased beyond their starting mass, indicating changes in mass were largely due to reversible water loss. However, some residual mass differences between control and drying treatments suggest differences in tissue mass, potentially attributable to suspended feeding and clitellum regression, characteristic features of aestivation. Overall, these findings show that Al. chlorotica is highly desiccation tolerant, but that soil texture strongly modulates both the onset and viability of aestivation, with implications for predicting earthworm resilience under future drought regimes.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

For example, Colias philodice and C. eurytheme (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) hybridize when their ranges are in contact or overlap and are commonly found in large cities throughout North America. However, it is an open question how variation in urbanization might affect variation in hybridization. Using wild Colias across a gradient of urbanization in Toronto, Ontario, we tested how the variation in Colias colour, as an indicator of hybridization, relates to human disturbance and urbanization. We created an objective numeric classification for both C. eurytheme and C. philodice, against which we categorized Colias samples. We found that some of the urbanization metrics, including distance to road, Julian date, and number of pedestrians affect the variation in Colias colour, suggesting that urbanization affects Colias colouration, and potentially rates of hybridization, in Toronto.

Especially when the parameter space is large and data is semi quantitive but comparable across different experimental conditions. Here, we present a set of command line tools utilising Pycotools (COPASI) that leverages the power of high-performance computing to facilitate parameter estimation of large models with many unknown parameters. In particular, we expand upon the abilities of Pycotools to address two particular issues. Firstly, the difficulty of constraining a model's parameterisation to assume the system begins in a steady state (prior to a perturbative stimulation). And secondly, parameterising against relative quantitative time series data that have no absolute scale. Our software operates on the SLURM workload manager system and can be applied to any parameter estimation against time series data produced by applying a single perturbation at time zero to an equilibrated system. We validate that our technique can produce a parameterised model of the MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) network based on semi-quantitative time-series data from 2 breast cancer cell lines, stimulated with insulin and amino acids. We also show our model can make reasonable predictions on distinct signaling dynamics in one breast cancer cell line based on the other by adjusting the initial protein quantities only. In conclusion, models should fit both the initial steady state and the dynamics following stimulation, given that stabilising systems prior to stimulation is a common experimental protocol in signaling research.

A target-cell limited approach is often used to model within-host viral kinetics to characterize disease infection dynamics. The standard target-cell limited model, the TEIV model, has been instrumental for understanding SARS-CoV-2 within-host viral kinetics, however, its core assumptions of instantaneous viral budding and exponentially distributed cell lifetimes oversimplify fundamental biological processes, potentially limiting predictive power. In this work, we consider a novel model approach, the TEAIV model: an extension to the TEIV model that considers an infected partially-productive cell state that ramps up through n stages to a fully productive state. We fit the TEAIV model to various SARS-CoV-2 viral load datasets, separated by hospitalized (severe infection) and non-hospitalized (mild infection) individual data, consider multiple different ramping functions, and compare to standard TEIV model fits. We further compare TEAIV and TEIV model fits with and without infected cell death incorporated in the eclipse (E) and partially infected (A) compartments and investigate best-fit frameworks up to 10 A states. We find that linear budding ramp-up dynamics minimizes the BIC (with DeltaBIC > 2) across all model formulations when the total number of eclipse and budding compartments exceeds three. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion or exclusion of cell death applied to eclipse or ramping compartments does not substantially affect this result. Finally, we analytically consider the most general TEAIV model and discuss future modelling considerations. Our results demonstrate that accounting for non-instantaneous viral budding provides a better fit to SARS-CoV-2 viral load data and establishes a foundation for more mechanistically informed within-host models.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

The effects of E2 and progesterone, selective estrogen receptor agonists, and direct brain infusions of E2 and receptor antagonists were evaluated. Results: E2 administration increased wakefulness, reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and decreased NREM slow-wave activity (SWA), predominantly during the dark phase. These effects required both estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and beta (ER{beta}) activation and were mediated by estrogen receptor signaling within the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Direct infusion of E2 into the MnPO was sufficient to replicate systemic effects, while local infusion of the pure estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (Fulvestrant) attenuated them.

M.; Sabatini, B. L.", "abstract": "Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons provide precisely timed, context-dependent inhibition within cortical circuits. PV neuron firing properties are specialized among cortical neurons, suggesting that they express a unique complement of ion channels. Here, we identify the PV-specific silent voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel subunit Kv6.4 (encoded by Kcng4) as a modulator of both intrinsic and synaptic properties. Kv6.4 does not form functional channels on its own but assembles with Kv2 subunits to create heterotetrameric channel complexes. Kcng4 expression is enriched within a distinct Pvalb-expressing subclass in primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex and emerges during postnatal development. Kv6.4 depolarizes the interspike and threshold potentials, broadens action potentials (APs), increases AP height, and decelerates the AP upstroke. These changes in AP waveform enhance GABA release probability and paired-pulse depression at synapses made by PV onto pyramidal (PYR) neurons. The effects of Kv6.4 loss are amplified during high-frequency firing, within the physiological range of fast-spiking PV neurons, likely due to altered repolarization dynamics that accumulate across successive APs. These findings are thus consistent with the function of Kv6.4 in modifying Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier currents. Hence, Kv6.4 tunes the temporal precision of PV inhibitory output, a feature that may be critical for stable excitation-inhibition ratios and adaptive circuit function underlying learning and behavior.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Methods based on radioactive [3H]-GABA uptake come with significant regulatory concerns, cost, and workflow complexity, which could be resolved by an alternate assay. To address this issue, we developed a high-content fluorescence imaging assay of GAT-1-mediated GABA uptake using a genetically encoded GABA sensor, iGABA-Snfr. We demonstrated that pathogenic variants strongly reduced uptake (mean, -89.4% [95% CI, -71.5% to -107.3%]).

Methods: We developed an end-to-end offline dMRI reconstruction pipeline for GE HealthCare acquisitions, building on and augmenting the Orchestra software development kit and validated its output against scanner reconstruction. We used it to compare MPPCA, NORDIC and ARDL denoising approaches, considering underlying metrics reflecting noise variance and noise floor suppression, such as the signal dynamic range and ADC in highly anisotropic areas, noise variance in maximally-suppressed dMRI signal and downstream measurements, such as fibre orientation estimation and white matter tractography. Results: Our validated offline reconstruction starts from single-channel complex k-space data and allows channel combination, support of various in-plane/out-of-plane accelerations and partial Fourier reconstruction methods and retrospectively switching filters off.

Using reconstituted cell systems and human intestinal enteroids (HIEs), we found that NS7 interacts with both NLRP3 and NLRP6, promoting ASC speck formation, caspase-1 cleavage, and secretion of IL-1{beta} and IL-18. HNoV infection of HIEs recapitulated these events, including gasdermin D processing and robust IL-18 release. Importantly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NLRP6 deficiency abrogated inflammasome activation and markedly enhanced viral replication, underscoring the essential role of NLRP6 in epithelial antiviral defense. These findings identify NS7 as a novel inflammasome activator and establish NLRP6 as a key determinant of innate immune control of HNoV. Our study highlights inflammasome signaling as a potential therapeutic target for norovirus infection.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

S.; Jarboe, L.

However, their distribution in fresh (loafing pen surface) versus pit-stored dairy manure has not been previously characterized. To address this gap, we quantified the abundance of six ARGs (tetG, tetM, tetX- tetracyline, sul1- sulfonamide, and ermB-macrolide) and three mobile genetic elements (MGEs: intI1, intI2, and intI3) in iDNA and exDNA extracted from fresh and pit-stored manure collected at a dairy farm in Iowa. While total DNA yields were lower in pit-stored relative to fresh manure samples, exDNA-to-iDNA ratios were significantly elevated across all genes (p<0.001), indicating relative enrichment of exDNA during storage. Notably, tetM exhibited a higher free (unattached) to bound (surface-attached) exDNA ratio in pit samples, which suggested an increased potential for gene transfer in the pit. Correlation network analysis revealed similar numbers of strong ARG-MGE linkages in pit and fresh exDNA, but combining fresh and pit datasets showed broader associations: intI1 and intI3 co-occurred with tetracyclines and macrolide resistance in iDNA, while sul1 correlated with MGEs only in exDNA. Microbial community profiling showed similar taxa in exDNA across manure types, while iDNA communities diverged significantly. This result could support that exDNA is relatively stable over time and in varying environments, and that iDNA is more reflective of selective pressures. Overall, our results highlight exDNA as a critical but overlooked reservoir of resistance determinants, warranting further investigation and targeted management strategies in dairy systems.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

While competition for limiting resources is well studied, the combined effects of competition and facilitation remain poorly understood when microbes require multiple, non-substitutable resources such as carbon and nitrogen. Here we develop a trait-based consumer-resource framework to test how recipient populations-whose growth relies on the metabolic products of other groups-reshape the ecological niches of their feeders and competitors. Invasion analysis shows that recipients expand either their feeder's or the feeder's competitor's niche, depending on whether they are superior competitors for resources limiting the feeder's rivals or the feeder itself. These shifts alter biogeochemical outcomes: high organic matter to nitrate supply ratios favor nitrous oxide cycling over dinitrogen gas production. Moreover, anammox bacteria occupy a wider range of organic matter and nitrate supply regimes than nitrite-reducing denitrifiers, consistent with their more frequent detectability in diverse marine environments. Together, our results link microbial interaction networks to global biogeochemical fluxes, advancing trait-based ecological theory for multi-resource systems.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

We focused on three positive-sense RNA viruses that naturally establish persistent infections: Drosophila A virus (DAV), Drosophila C virus (DCV), and Nora virus. We examined how these viruses interact with their hosts during development and we found that pupal metamorphosis is a critical window where virus-host immune interactions influence persistence differently across viruses. Peak viral loads and replication occur during pupation, coinciding with increased endogenous reverse transcriptase activity. Notably, reverse transcription of viral RNA genomes produces viral DNA (vDNA) forms of DAV and DCV that are first detectable during pupation and are involved in persistence. In contrast, Nora virus achieves persistence without detectable vDNA. Immune responses during pupation are virus-specific, involving suppression of RNA interference components and varied regulation of JAK-STAT signaling. After metamorphosis, DAV continues producing vDNA into adulthood while DCV shows transient vDNA production, and Nora virus bypasses vDNA production altogether. These findings point to pupation as a key developmental stage for the establishment of persistent infections through distinct viral persistence strategies.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Dental implants provide a unique opportunity to investigate these processes by establishing a defined time-zero for initial bacterial attachment. In this cohort study, we performed shotgun metagenomics on 95 subgingival plaque samples from 19 participants, including peri-implant sites at weeks 1-4 after crown placement and adjacent teeth as controls. Peri-implant and adjacent periodontal microbiomes exhibited distinct taxonomic and functional profiles. Even the same taxa had different functional potential across the two sites. These findings indicated that oral microbiome development is a niche-specific process with selective colonization rather than passive microbial translocation from adjacent sites. Longitudinal analysis identified three microbial community modules driving the succession of oral microbiome, including pioneer colonizers, constitutive species, and late commensals. Each module followed distinct temporal abundance patterns and played unique ecological roles throughout the succession process. Strain-level resolution revealed divergent microevolutionary trajectories: pioneer colonizers and late commensals exhibited higher cumulative mutation rates and greater strain heterogeneity overtime, with enrichment of nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants in genes related to virulence and metabolism, whereas constitutive species remained evolutionarily stable by contrast. Our study reveals that the development, succession, and microevolution of the oral microbiome is structured, niche-dependent, and modulated by inter-species facilitation and selective genomic adaptation.

Here we present the first comprehensive study of Halogranum sp. SS5-1 isolated from a solar saltern in Samut Sakhon, Thailand. Hgn. SS5-1 is a pleomorphic, aerobic heterotroph that thrives in high salinity and moderate temperature and is capable of hydrolysing starch. Its genome consists of a 3.6 Mbp chromosome and seven additional plasmids. Based on our phylogenetic analyses, which establish Hgn. SS5-1 as a distinct species, we propose that it will be classified as the novel species Halogranum roseipondis sp. nov. SS5-1T. Additionally, we report that Hgn. roseipondis sp.nov. SS5-1T is infected by Hagravirus capitaneum (HGTV-1), the only virus known to infect a Halogranum host. HGTV-1 exhibits a unique head-tailed morphology and encodes the largest archaeal virus dsDNA genome known to date, including 34 tRNA encoding genes. Codon usage analysis of the viral genome suggests partial alignment with host preferences, yet the abundance of viral tRNA genes hints to broader roles, potentially including translation modulation.

This study identifies, for the first time, the complete Efg1 regulon that is active during growth in human urine. We confirmed the clinical relevance of this discovery, finding that many of these Efg1-regulated factors are present and significantly upregulated in catheter samples from patients with C. albicans infections. Furthermore, we characterized two of these key factors, ECE1 and EED1, validating their roles both in vitro in urine conditions and in vivo using a CAUTI mouse model.

Here, we introduce a multimodal proteomics approach to systematically characterize these overlooked effects, providing a crucial framework for comprehensive target engagement analysis. Our integrated platform, which combines affinity purification coupled with limited proteolysis mass spectrometry (AP-LiP-MS), AP-MS and in vivo proximity labelling, enables comprehensive exploration of inhibitor-induced allosteric and non-catalytic functional changes. Using this pipeline, we discovered that all four kinases analyzed (DCLK1, CAMKK2, CHEK1, and PRKCA) undergo structural rearrangements upon inhibitor binding in the autoinhibitory domain (AID) and other regions. These structural shifts underlie changes in complex formation, membrane association and other non-catalytic functions.

How plant cells communicate with neighboring cells to coordinate expansion for properly patterned tissues and organs is not well understood. In seed plants, organ growth is known to be modulated by sulfotyrosyl peptide signaling. Here, we report that the activity of TYROSYL PROTEIN SULFOTRANSFERASE (TPST), which is responsible for the post-translational modification of sulfotyrosyl peptides, is essential for expansion during development in the non-vascular plant, Physcomitrium patens. Plants that harbor a null mutation in the gene encoding TPST ({triangleup}tpst) were smaller, and while they formed gametophore initials, the gametophores did not fully expand. Mutational analysis of P. patens TPST identified the residue Histidine 124, a candidate catalytic residue, as essential for TPST function. Notably, addition of the sulfated signaling peptide, PSY1 from either P. patens or Arabidopsis thaliana, rescued all {triangleup}tpst developmental deficits. Taken together, these data suggest that TPST functions to sulfate PSY, and this activity is necessary for plant growth and development. Furthermore, since addition of AtPSY fully rescues {triangleup}tpst and PpPSY promotes root elongation in Arabidopsis and rice, these findings suggest that PSY signaling is evolutionarily conserved.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Yet, theoretical models of direct-benefits sexual selection are scarce. Here, we use individual-based evolutionary simulations to explore the joint evolution of female mating preferences and male ornamentation under sexual selection driven by direct benefits. We find that, within each generation, male ornamentation reliably indicates paternal quality (the direct benefit); females thus benefit from being choosy and readily evolve preferences for male ornamentation. Yet this in turn selects for males to invest resources in ornamentation at the expense of paternal care. Across generations, female selection for ornamented males (driven by the pursuit of direct benefits) thus erodes the very benefit it seeks, leading to population decline and potentially extinction.

Inbreeding depression is a well-known risk in small, isolated populations, where reduced genetic diversity can compromise fitness and threaten population persistence. While correlations between inbreeding and reduced fitness are well documented, so far, no causal variant for a fitness-relevant phenotype has been described in a wild population. Here, we combine long-term health and population data with genomic analyses to identify a recessive lethal allele responsible for extensive organ mineralization in young Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) from a reintroduced population in Switzerland. The causal variant is located in FGF23 and predicted to impair secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23, an important regulator of phosphate homeostasis. The deleterious allele was likely introduced from one of the lynx source populations and subsequently increased in frequency through founder effects and inbreeding. All three Swiss lynx populations show high inbreeding levels (FROH > 0.4), reflecting substantial loss of genetic diversity.

Remarkably, no related enzymes have ever been reported in prokaryotic organisms. Here, we describe the discovery of a novel family of diverse bacterial heme-thiolate peroxygenases through structure database mining, followed by functional characterization of selected representatives. The bacterial UPO-like proteins (BUPOs) are structurally analogous to family I (short) fungal UPOs, despite having sequence similarity below 20%. Expression of one of these proteins (HydBUPO) in its native host (Hydrogenophaga sp. A37) was confirmed by proteomics. Further, several BUPOs were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. In biochemical assays, the BUPOs were able to catalyze one-electron oxidation (peroxidase activity) of ABTS and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and two-electron oxidation (peroxygenase activity) of naphthalene, indole, 3-phenyl-1-propanol and 16-hydroxypalmitic acid, using hydrogen peroxide as co-substrate.

Conventional metagenomic classifiers based on exact k-mer matching or alignment lose discriminative power on such short and damaged reads, limiting the analysis of paleogenomic samples. We present FALCON2, a compression-based metagenomic classifier that leverages position-aware finite-context models to maintain high accuracy on degraded viral ancient viruses. FALCON2 consolidates the capabilities of its predecessor, FALCON-meta, into a unified executable with enhanced features including model persistence, direct processing of compressed inputs, multiple file handling, and optional pre-filtering methodologies for contaminated samples. Under controlled benchmarking with database, taxonomy, and thread parity on simulated viral datasets, FALCON2 achieved an Area Under the Curve of Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC) of 0.999, an Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.968, and an F1-score of 0.918, substantially outperforming Centrifuge (AUPRC = 0.625), Kraken2 (AUPRC = 0.184), and CLARK-S (AUPRC = 0.013) on pooled micro-averaged metrics. FALCON2's advantage is most pronounced on ultra-short reads (20-40 bp), where exact k-mers become sparse. FALCON2 pre-filtering at threshold 0.7 improved precision by 10 percentage points with negligible recall loss. FALCON2 runs on systems with 4-8 GB RAM for typical analyses.

Influenza C virus possesses a single surface glycoprotein, the haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein that forms hexagonal arrays on the membrane envelope and is sufficient for budding of spherical particles. However, a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice cannot completely cover a spherical virus membrane without defects. Using electron cryotomography (cryo-ET), we study the structural arrangement of the influenza C virus surface and find the hexagonal HEF lattice contains 5-fold and 7-fold defects organised in grain boundaries. The number of excess dislocations increases with system size while maintaining a net topological charge near 12. Our observations of defects in spherical crystals on influenza C virus particles of varying radius and shape matches theoretical predictions of continuum elastic theory for the proliferation of defects on soft lattices and experimental observations on colloidal systems. These findings provide new principles for assembly of pleomorphic viruses, extending the description of defects required for viral lattice assembly beyond the Caspar-Klug theory developed for isometric viruses. Our study informs a wide range of molecular self-assembly processes in biology and may also have implications for developing lattice materials with curved surfaces.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

A computational extension of the Hybrid Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)-Branching framework was developed to model clonal diversification and phenotypic stabilization in pediatric leukemia. The OU component captures mean-reverting dynamics representing developmental homeostasis, while the branching component introduces stochastic lineage bifurcation and extinction. Using de-identified clinical metadata from Ahlgren et al. (Nature Communications, 2025; 16:8964), the model simulates patient-specific evolutionary trajectories across relapse categories and disease subtypes (B-ALL, T-ALL, MPAL, AML). Simulations reproduce observed clinical trends-rapid relapse and limited diversification in early or refractory KMT2A-r ALL, and slower, therapy-resistant relapses in AML. Group- and patient-level analyses demonstrate how the balance between stabilizing selection (theta) and diversification rate (lambda) determines clonal persistence and phenotypic drift. This computational implementation provides a quantitative framework for linking developmental constraint, clonal diversity, and therapeutic response in pediatric malignancies and establishes a tractable platform for model-driven hypothesis testing and translational oncology.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Developing wheat lines with biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) is a promising strategy to reduce such emissions. However, the effectiveness of BNI depends not only on plant characteristics, but also on how they interact with environmental factors such as soil pH and elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2). This study evaluated the response of a BNI-capable wheat line (Triticum aestivum cv. ROELFS) to eCO2 under contrasting soil pH during the 30 days following ammonium fertilization. Two wheat lines (ROELFS-Control and ROELFS-BNI) were grown under ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) CO2 in acidic (pH 5.3) and alkaline (pH 8.8) soils. N2O emissions, nitrifying and denitrifying microbial communities, and soil chemical properties were monitored to assess plant-soil-microbe interactions. ROELFS-BNI consistently reduced N2O emissions under all conditions by reducing archaeal (Nitrososphaeraceae) and bacterial nitrifiers (Nitrosomonadaceae, Nitrospiraceae) without major shifts in overall microbial composition, indicating high specificity of BNI exudates. Elevated CO2 effects on N2O emissions were pH-dependent. In acidic soil, eCO2 increased emissions in ROELFS-Control but not in ROELFS-BNI, likely due to the enrichment of complete denitrifiers (e.g. Rhodanobacteraceae). However, in alkaline soil, eCO2 reduced N2O emissions in both Control and BNI lines, especially the latter, which was associated with a higher abundance of N2O-reducing denitrifiers (e.g. Burkholderiaceae). This study highlights the potential of ROELFS-BNI wheat as a sustainable practice to mitigate N pollution adaptable to diverse soils and predicted CO2 atmospheric conditions.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we propose a multi-scale simulation approach which couples molecular simulations with neuronal simulations to predict the variations in membrane potential and neural spikes. We illustrate this through two examples. First, molecular dynamics simulations predict changes in current and conductance through the AMPAR neuroreceptor when transitioning from the wild-type protein to certain disease-associated variants. The results of these simulations inform morphologically detailed models of cortical pyramidal neurons, which are simulated using the Arbor framework to determine neural spike activity. Based on these multiscale simulations, we suggest that disease associated AMPAR variants may significantly impact neuronal excitability. In the second example, the Arbor model is coupled with coarse-grained Monte Carlo gating simulations of voltage-gated (K+ and Na+) channels. The predicted current from these ion channels altered the membrane potential and, in turn, the excitation state of the neuron was updated in Arbor. The resulting membrane potential was then fed back into the Monte Carlo simulations of the voltage-gated ion channels, resulting in a bidirectional coupling of current and membrane potential. This allowed the transitions of the states of the ion channels to influence the membrane potentials and vice versa. Our simulations also included the crucial - so far unexplored - effects of the composition of the lipid membrane embedding the ion channels on the membrane potential and revealed a significant impact of temperature on the neuronal excitability. Our combined approaches predicted membrane potentials consistent with electrophysiological recordings and established a multi-scale framework linking the atomistic perturbations to neuronal excitability.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

During the early stages of retroviral infection, such as with murine leukemia virus (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), host core and H1 histones are rapidly deposited onto unintegrated viral DNAs upon nuclear entry. These unintegrated viral DNAs are transcriptionally silenced through histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), including high levels of H3K9 trimethylation and low levels of H3 acetylation. Linker histone H1 is closely associated with chromatin compaction and histone PTMs, suggesting a potential role in regulating retroviral DNA fate. In this study, we demonstrate that simultaneous knockdown of four somatic H1 variants (H1.2, H1.3, H1.4, and H1.5) in K562 cells reverses the silencing of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA, resulting in increased viral expression. Notably, this effect was specific to HIV-1, as the same H1 depletion did not alter the silencing of MLV unintegrated DNA.

The plrSR genes are in the middle of a six-gene cluster whose regulation and roles during infection were unknown. rsmB and plrP are often found 5' to plrSR homologs in {beta}- and {gamma}-proteobacteria, while trkAH are often found 3' to plrSR homologs in -proteobacteria. We investigated these genes to determine if they have a functional link to plrSR. We found that this gene cluster does not function as an operon. Rather, it contains two internal promoters: a weaker promoter in the 3' end of rsmB and a stronger promoter in the 3' end of plrS. Additionally, our results indicate that PlrP functions as a third component of the PlrSR TCS. Genetic manipulations of plrP, plrS, and plrR indicate that PlrP is essential in vitro and inhibits PlrS phosphatase activity, likely through PlrS's PDC domain. Since our results indicate that PlrR can be phosphorylated by another unknown phosphodonor in vitro, limiting PlrS phosphatase activity ensures PlrR~P is not dephosphorylated to lethally low levels. Using natural-host models, we determined that high levels of PlrR~P are required for in vivo survival, and PlrP affects PlrS activity in vivo. Given that plrP homologs always colocalize with ntrYX homologs, we propose that PlrP may fulfill similar functions in other {beta}- and {gamma}-proteobacteria that encode NtrYX-family TCSs, including nonpathogens.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that Ni-CODH/ECH enables metabolically flexible facultative anaerobes within the Anoxybacillaceae to survive electron acceptor limitation. Analysis of 387 Anoxybacillaceae genomes revealed that Ni-CODH/ECH had a patchy distribution and, with one exception, was mutually exclusive with the aerobic molybdenum-containing CODH. Culture experiments using the three isolates (Parageobacillus sp. G301, P. thermoglucosidasius NBRC 107763, and Thermolongibacillus altinsuensis B1-1) demonstrated that CO-dependent proton respiration is activated during stationary phase when exogenous electron acceptors are limiting, enhancing cell density 1.2- to 1.5-fold under 25% CO, whereas no effect was observed in a Ni-CODH knockout ({Delta}cooCSF) strain. RNA-seq analysis of strain G301 under twelve conditions revealed that Ni-CODH genes reached 2,000-12,500 TPM (top 0.2-1.9% of all genes) during stationary phase, independent of CO presence, under the predicted control of the redox-dependent transcriptional repressor Rex. {Delta}cooCSF cultures accumulated more trace CO than the wild-type, suggesting trace CO uptake by the wild-type. Thus, Ni-CODH/ECH is a redox-regulated auxiliary energy-conservation system that supports adaptation to electron acceptor limitation.

The structure shows how interactions between the F2A nascent chain (NC) and the ribosomal exit tunnel induce a conformational change in the peptidyl transferase center that precludes further translation elongation but instead pre-exposes the P-tRNA:F2A-NC ester bond for hydrolysis and NC release. Additionally, we bioinformatically characterized variation and host association across nearly 10,000 StopGo sequences identified in virus genomes. We expanded the canonical core motif to (D/G/C/N)(V/I)ExNPGP and identified additional rare but functional variants. We also revealed several distinct upstream motifs that we showed biochemically to be important for StopGo activity.

In this study, we characterized cis-regulatory elements controlling programmed SCR of the Drosophila POU3-family member drifter/ventral veins lacking (dfr/vvl).

The tree-cover gradient differentially influenced guild-level richness, evenness, and functionality. In open and semi-closed covers, insectivores showed greater functional richness, with traits adapted to foraging in open habitats, whereas intermediate vegetation supported higher evenness and functional complementarity in frugivores and granivores. Closed covers imposed stronger filtering on trait diversity. The results are consistent with metacommunity dynamics in which local assemblages and functional spillover sustain ecological processes at the mosaic scale.

We examined CUP1 copy number in 220 mutation accumulation lines and their ancestors to quantify spontaneous genetic change at this locus. We also measured copper tolerance in the same strains to understand the phenotypic effects of CUP1 copy number change and other mutations. We found that mutations in CUP1 copy number occurred rapidly, with a bias towards the loss of copies. While copper tolerance also declined due to spontaneous mutations, this change was less rapid overall and was only partly driven by CUP1 copy number.

In this study, we re-evaluated the prevalence, structure, and functional attributes of PPs across publicly available datasets comprising over 5 million viral and plasmid sequences. By employing a conservative and domain-centric approach that strictly filtered for high-quality phage genomes devoid of insertion sequences (ISs) and containing plasmid hallmark domains, we identified 3,002 putative PPs, representing a significantly lower proportion (~0.25%) than previous estimates. Our functional analyses revealed that PPs are more closely related to virulent phages than to temperate phages or plasmids and primarily encode partitioning proteins rather than conjugative machinery, suggesting episomal maintenance and vertical inheritance. PPs displayed genome sizes larger than most phages or plasmids, indicating a potential fitness cost to their bacterial hosts and explaining their rarity. Despite prior claims, we found no evidence of ARG carriage in PPs or virulent phages; only a minority of temperate phages harbored such genes. Furthermore, the dihydrofolate reductase genes commonly mistaken as ARGs were excluded due to their structural and functional roles during phage infection. Interestingly, majority of the PPs were Caudoviricetes with plasmid partitioning proteins, and PPs classified under Faserviricetes universally carried the relaxase NicK, likely reflecting their rolling-circle replication rather than conjugative potential. Our findings challenge earlier generalizations regarding PPs and support a revised view that emphasizes their derivation from bacteriophages, limited functional resemblance to plasmids, and limited role in ARG dissemination.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

However, genetic and genomic information on this species remains limited. In this study, we present a series of genomic analyses of selected D. catenulata strains, encompassing the full spectrum of their phylogenetic diversity. The species exhibits pronounced genetic structuring, with distinct clades representing deeply diverged lineages that show limited gene flow. This phenomenon is likely the result of clonal propagation or historical divergence. This study also uncovers a wide range of genes in both dairy and clinical isolates that are homologous to the drug resistance and virulence factors found in Candida albicans. A notable feature of D. catenulata genomes is an extensive degree of chromosomal instability associated with a novel DNA transposon family, called Dici, which has invaded all lineages. The high sequence conservation of Dici copies suggests a recent and potentially ongoing transpositional burst that is actively reshaping genome architecture. While the primary drivers of clade diversification remain to be elucidated, transposon activity and chromosomal rearrangements may have contributed to reproductive isolation and maintained genome plasticity. This multilayered genomic landscape provides a valuable model for studying DNA transposon proliferation, genome evolution, adaptation, and the emergence of pathogenicity in yeasts.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Palladin, an actin scaffold protein essential for cytoskeletal organization, contains tandem immunoglobulin domains (Ig3-4) separated by an unusually long (41-residue), arginine-rich, intrinsically disordered linker. While Ig3 mediates direct F-actin binding, the adjacent Ig4 domain and linker enhance binding and bundling, suggesting active roles beyond passive connection. Using targeted mutagenesis, actin co-sedimentation, bundling assays, and SAXS, we show that linker length, charge, and residue patterning are critical for activity. Shortening or replacing the 41-residue linker with the native Ig4-Ig5 linker reduced binding and abolished bundling, while small internal deletions decreased affinity but unexpectedly increased bundling efficiency. Neutralizing basic residues eliminated activity, increasing net positive charge favored bundling at the cost of binding affinity, and scrambling the sequence impaired both functions - demonstrating that electrostatic tuning and residue order, not just net charge, are essential. SAXS revealed that the native linker supports a broad, dynamic interdomain ensemble, enabling multiple binding-competent geometries. Shortened linkers restricted this conformational space, locking domains in extended orientations incompatible with efficient actin engagement. These results establish the Ig3-Ig4 linker as a finely tuned structural and electrostatic module that coordinates domain flexibility and filament crosslinking. More broadly, these findings highlight long, intrinsically disordered linkers as active determinants of cytoskeletal scaffold function, providing a general mechanism for modulating multivalent interactions in actin-binding proteins.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

A major obstacle to efficient MetaT analysis is the removal of highly abundant rRNA transcripts present in complex microbial communities, which may contain thousands of species. Although commercial rRNA depletion kits can effectively reduce rRNA content, they are typically optimized for specific host microbiomes and often underperform in others. For example, probes designed for the human gut microbiome frequently show reduced efficiency when applied to non-human samples such as mouse cecal donor samples - a common model in microbiome research. Regardless of the depletion strategy used, designing rRNA removal probes solely based on a microbiome's taxonomic composition often requires an extensive number of probes, making the approach expensive, difficult to manufacture, and sometimes technically impractical [3]. Here, we present RiboZAP, a species-agnostic computational pipeline for designing custom RNase H depletion probes directly from MetaT sequencing data and without prior knowledge of sample composition.

Beat type and waveform are tailored to function, differing between species and cell types, and individual flagella can switch between beat types.

Eight distinct dynein motor protein complexes bind to axonemal doublet microtubules (DMTs) within flagella and drive beating, yet despite extensive structural analysis3-5, how this machinery achieves different beat types is unknown. Here, using the flagellate unicellular parasite Leishmania, we show a division of labour where specific dyneins drive specific beat types. Using cryo-EM, we determined the structure of the 96-nm repeat unit of the DMT and identified its dynein composition. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to systematically delete all 96-nm repeat proteins, comprehensively mapping necessity for swimming, and determined the contribution of each dynein to incidence and waveform of the preferred beat types. Outer dynein arms (ODAs) were required for symmetric tip-to-base beats, specific single-headed inner dynein arms (IDAs) were important for asymmetric base-to-tip beats (IDAd), and double-headed IDAf important for both.

These systems can learn desired responses, encode memory, and robustly reorganize under repeated stimuli, much like artificial neural networks but without requiring processors to adjust their weights. Here, we extend this paradigm to morphogenesis and show that the epithelium can be viewed as tunable matter and that epithelial convergent extension (CE) can be understood as a self-tuning process. Using a vertex model with active interfacial tensions, we systematically compare distinct tension-update strategies, including externally imposed shear, global gradient descent optimization, and decentralized local feedback rules. We find that while all methods can generate tissue elongation, only local orientation- and length-sensitive rules reproduce key experimental features of CE, such as supracellular actomyosin pattern formation, cell shape changes, and junctional alignment. In contrast, global optimization produces homogeneous tension patterns and mechanically fragile states. By interpreting CE through the lens of tuning, our framework bridges the physics of tunable matter with developmental biology, revealing how simple, local rules enable tissues to efficiently orchestrate complex morphogenetic outcomes through decentralized mechanical adaptation.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Ezrin is a peripheral membrane protein that contributes to the organization and stability of cellular membrane structures by reversibly linking the plasma membrane to actin filaments. The formation of this membrane-actin linkage has been experimentally shown to require ezrin N-terminal (FERM) domain binding to PI(4,5)P2 phospholipid-enriched membrane sites and the phosphorylation of the ezrin Cterminal domain (CTD) at residue T567. Collectively, membrane association and T567 phosphorylation are believed to promote separation of the FERM and CTD domains; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains less clear. In this study, we investigate the mechanistic steps of ezrin activation and the thermodynamic free energy landscape of FERM-CTD dissociation using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD). We find that upon ezrin attachment to a lipid membrane, PI(4,5)P2 molecules outcompete other phospholipids at the surface of the FERM F1 and F3 subdomains. This interaction triggers a major conformational rearrangement within the FERM domain that destabilizes the FERM F2-CTD interface and initiates dissociation between the FERM and CTD. By employing well-tempered metadynamics (WTMetaD) with a contact-map collective variable, we determine that the principal barrier to FERM-CTD dissociation comes from F3-CTD interactions and that this dissociation can happen spontaneously with a moderate free energy barrier. We also show that the FERM-CTD reassociation after ezrin T567 phosphorylation is impeded due to reduced dissociation energy barrier. The free energy profile of dissociation between FERM and the CTD-replacing EBP50 protein is similar to that of the FERM-CTD system with nonphosphorylated T567, which agrees well with an in vivo experimental observation that EBP50 competes with the CTD for F2-F3 binding after CTD is dissociated. Together, our results help establish a revised view on the ezrin activation mechanism where FERM binding to PI(4,5)P2 enables spontaneous dissociation of the nonphosphorylated CTD.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Improving these assays is essential for hatchery managers, farmers, and scientists seeking to identify resilient stocks and monitor stress in shellfish populations. Resazurin, a redox-sensitive dye commonly used in cell viability assays, offers a promising, high-throughput assay for metabolic rate assessment, but its application at the whole-organism level remains under explored. This study evaluates the efficacy of a resazurin-based metabolic assay in oysters (Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea virginica) through four experimental approaches: (1) adaptation of the resazurin assay to measure oyster metabolism, (2) examination of temperature effects on oyster metabolism, (3) characterization of acute thermal stress responses, (4) examination of genetic variability in metabolism, and (5) correlations between metabolism and predicted performance in a selective breeding case study. Our findings confirm that resazurin fluorescence is correlated with oxygen consumption, validating its use as a measure of metabolism. Thermal performance assays reveal expected metabolic responses to temperature, including identification of optima and tipping points where metabolic stimulation shifts to depression under temperature stress. Acute thermal stress experiments demonstrate that oysters exhibiting greater metabolic depression are more likely to survive, supporting metabolism as a predictor of mortality. Further, genetic variation in stress responses is detected as family-level variation in metabolism. Metabolism of 50 families (C. virginica) selectively bred for performance in varying environments was measured and significantly correlated with predicted performance. By establishing resazurin as an additional reliable and scalable method for metabolic assessment, this study lays the groundwork for its broader adoption in aquaculture and conservation.

Although this phenomenon is well established for simple stimuli, its underlying neural mechanism during natural scene perception remains unclear. Using fMRI, we examined how motion congruence and categorical similarity between central and surrounding scenes shape surround modulation across the visual hierarchy. Central and surrounding scenes systematically varied in categorical similarity (identical exemplar, different exemplar of the same basic-level category, different basic-level category, or different superordinate category) and in motion direction (same or opposite direction). Neural responses were measured in primary visual cortex (V1), motion-selective cortex (hMT$+$), and scene-selective occipital and parahippocampal place areas (OPA and PPA). hMT$+$ showed robust motion-dependent surround suppression, which was stronger for same-direction motion. In contrast, V1 showed surround facilitation across all conditions, which was reduced when center and surround were identical and moved in the same direction, consistent with sensitivity to physical similarity. OPA and PPA primarily exhibited facilitation. Multivariate decoding between center-only and center-surround conditions complemented these findings, revealing motion-dependent surround modulation in hMT$+$, and category-dependent surround modulation in OPA and PPA. Across the visual hierarchy, surrounding scene context thus systematically attenuates redundant input or enhances informative differences: from low-level facilitation in V1 to motion-dependent suppression in hMT$+$ and category-dependent modulation in scene-selective regions.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Both drugs reduced the expression of belief precision between 160 to 184 ms, peaking at 172 ms. For higher-level volatility pwPEs, ketamine reduced the expression at 312 ms while psilocybin had a null effect.

To our knowledge, our work is the first to show that during pneumonia, transcription of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is increased in macrophages by the NF-{kappa}B transcription factor, p65, through its signaling adaptor protein, MyD88, leading to increased Piezo1 Ca2+ channel activity. Piezo1 mRNA abundance is increased in association with open chromatin at the Piezo1 promoter in macrophages. The enhanced level of Piezo1 increases the abundance of transcription factor EB (Tfeb) resulting in lysosome biogenesis and stiffness-dependent phagolysosome maturation, a critical step for macrophage bacterial clearance.

To investigate its diversity and possible introduction routes, we performed whole-genome sequencing of Slovenian and other Pss isolates and compared them with publicly available genomes. Comparative genomics revealed that Pss forms a distinct clade within P. stewartii, exhibiting high average nucleotide identity (>99.9%). Most of the Slovenian isolates clustered closely together, forming a separate branch consistent with at least two independent introduction events. They were genetically distinct from recent Italian isolates. Additionally, several unique plasmids and prophages were identified in Pss isolates, with notable diversity in mobile genetic elements despite overall genomic homogeneity. Pangenome analysis confirmed an open pangenome for P. stewartii, with greater genomic diversity among non-Pss strains. Functional analysis identified multiple secretion systems in Pss, which are likely to contribute to its pathogenicity and insect-mediated transmission. Our findings highlight previously unrecognised diversity within the subspecies and confirm the presence of at least two distinct clades within P. stewartii. So far, the detections in Slovenia remain confined to the Vipava Valley with evidence of multiple introduction events.

The lipid Phthiocerol Dimycocerosate (PDIM) directs the physical organization of these amyloid-encased bacilli into a foundational corded scaffold, while the ESX-1 secretion system contributes to the biochemical complexity of the extracellular matrix. This three-component model, which separates structural integrity, physical organization, and biochemical maturation, provides a new architectural paradigm that may inform strategies to overcome drug tolerance by dismantling these protective communities.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

The specific enzymes governing H4K16ac homeostasis, particularly the deacetylase responsible for its loss in HGPS, remain poorly defined. Here, we sought to identify the enzymes regulating H4K16ac and determine if their inhibition could rescue HGPS-associated cellular defects. Using systematic siRNA screening in HeLa and U2OS cells, we confirmed that KAT8/MOF is the principal H4K16 acetyltransferase. Surprisingly, we identified HDAC2 as the dominant class I histone deacetylase for H4K16ac; knockdown of the highly homologous HDAC1 had no effect. While SIRT1 knockdown also increased H4K16ac, its contribution was minimal in HGPS vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) compared to HDAC2. Crucially, selective pharmacological inhibition of HDAC2, but not SIRT1, robustly restored H4K16ac levels in HGPS VSMCs. This restoration led to a significant rescue of premature aging phenotypes, including improvements in nuclear morphology, preservation of proliferative capacity (Ki67) at late passages, and a significant reduction in cellular senescence. The effects of HDAC2 inhibition on cellular senescence and nuclear morphology suggests that HDAC2-mediated histone deacetylation contributes directly to the pathological features of HGPS, extending the functional impact of HDAC2 inhibition beyond DNA repair defects to fundamental aspects of cellular aging.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

The gut microbiome serves as an indicator for health and fitness and indicates the types of stress. To investigate the combined effects of thermal stress and pathogenic infection on bee guts, we performed a two-by-two crossed design where Bombus impatiens workers were subjected to hot conditions, pathogenic infection, or both. Incubation groups were given 2-weeks of stress conditions, with infected bees initially inoculated with Crithidia bombi, a common bee gut parasite. We measured body size, quantified the infection intensity of C. bombi using qPCR, and defined the composition of the gut microbiome using full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies Mk1D. While the core gut microbiome thrived with genera such as Bombilactobacillus and Snodgrassila which were not impacted by treatment; there were notable changes in other key organisms. Asaia bogorensis spiked in control temperature infected organisms, while species of Lactobacillus were overtaken in hot temperatures by significant increases in Apilactobacillus kunkeei. Species such as Citrobacter freundii dominated in hot infected bees suggesting an increased immunocompromised state from the combined stressors impacts on bee gut health. Our novel combined effects from thermal stress and pathogenic infection strengthen existing literature and provide new directions on how to quantify the health-state of wild bees based on their gut microbiome composition.

To address these clinical problems, we have developed a two-drug treatment that induces lethal DNA damage and G2-arrest in p53 mutant cancer cells. Here, we present a triple-drug therapeutic strategy that combines our two-drug regimen with a G2-checkpoint kinase inhibitor. The two-drug treatment with TAS102 plus PARP inhibitor (PARPi) acts as an inducer-amplifier pair to induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and a prolonged G2-arrest specifically in p53 mutant cells. Subsequent inhibition of the G2-checkpoint kinases, such as WEE1 or ATR, releases these G2-arrested cells into mitosis, leading to cell death. The delayed administration of a G2-kinase inhibitor provides p53 wild-type cells with time to repair DNA, thereby minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. This sequential triple-drug strategy exhibited robust efficacy in preclinical models of colorectal and pancreatic cancers.

Our results showed that emotional salience strengthened neural tracking of attended but not ignored conversations. This enhancement unfolded nonlinearly across the conversational arc, peaking early when the dialogue was coherent and later when incoherent. Cortical temporal response functions revealed latency-specific effects: emotional salience amplified early sensory encoding under uncertainty in auditory and language networks, whereas late semantic integration in these areas was driven by salience alone.

In many of these instances, nascent multicellularity has remained facultative, manifesting only under conditions where it provides a decisive fitness advantage to the genome in which it has arisen. Here we investigate the mechanistic basis for, and the selective advantages of, cryptic multicellularity in wild strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Meiotic purification of this trait, followed by genome sequencing, indicates that the genome of diploid champagne yeast DB146 is homozygous at the AMN1 locus (Antagonist of Mitotic exit Network) for an allele that dysregulates post-mitotic cell separation. Expression of this trait in haploid derivatives of DB146 results in clonal multicellular clusters in which daughters remain attached to mother cell walls. Systematic analysis of viability in haploid and diploid DB146 derivatives subjected to benign conditions as well as to starvation, desiccation, and low temperature at different cell titers demonstrates that haploid multicellular variants exhibit higher survivorship under conditions that wild yeast likely experience when they overwinter. Examining a collection of other wild strains, we find that ~20% exhibit ploidy-dependent expression of clonal multicellularity. Altogether, our data suggest that in yeast that sporulate when starved, cryptic multicellularity may come under balancing selection because haploid multicellular progeny enjoy a transient survival advantage that fades once favorable growth conditions resume.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

Our approach consisted of 18 iterative loops of measurements and models, combining distributed participatory field sampling, lab analysis, automated machine learning (ML) predictions, and error and distinctiveness analyses to autonomously guide the next sampling at optimal site locations. Through our approach, we increased the predictive power of sediment oxygen consumption across CONUS by over fifteenfold between the first and last iteration. Relative to our last sampling iteration, our first sampling missed sites with high rates and underestimated median oxygen consumption rates by 68%. In addition to identifying areas of high oxygen consumption rates, iterations enabled refinement of laboratory and data handling methods, and engagement with a broad community of field researchers.

The attractive targeted sugar baits (ATSBs) have demonstrated effectiveness in some settings but have shown limited impact in other areas, likely due to differences in mosquito species preferences and the presence of competing natural sugar sources. However, these factors remain poorly understood and understudied. We evaluated sugar-feeding behaviour of Anopheline mosquitoes in a sugarcane plantation area of Chikwawa, Malawi, to generate additional field data that could enhance the efficacy and design of sugar-based vector control tools tailored for malaria endemic regions such as Malawi. Methods Using three collection tools, CDC Light traps; Prokopack aspirator and the barrier screen, we collected 187 adult anophelines from the Illovo sugar plantations. Collected mosquitoes were subjected to cold anthrone tests in the laboratory to assess the presence of plant sugars in their gut. Additionally, 810 adult Anopheles gambiae s.l, reared in the insectary from wild caught larvae, were exposed in an olfactory-driven choice experiment to identify the most attractive available sugar source in the area. Sugar sources included guavas, melon, bananas, mango, marula and sugarcane. Results Over 40% (n=74) of the collected Anopheles mosquitoes- including An. gambiae s.l, An. funestus, An. coustani and An. tenebrous were found to have fed on natural sugar sources. For the sugar attractiveness tests for An. gambiae s.l, guava was found to be twice as attractive (IRR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.49-2.62, p < 0.001) as sugarcane (our reference fruit), followed by banana (IRR= 1.68, 95% CI: 1.26-2.24, P < 0.001), then mango, and melon (IRR= 1.49, 95% CI: 1.11-2.01, P= 0.008) and (IRR=1.45, 95% CI: 1.08-1.96, P= 0.014) respectively. Conclusion Sugar feeding is a key activity for Anopheles mosquitoes and presents a potential target for control efforts. In this setting with abundant sugarcane, guava was identified as the most attractive sugar source for An. gambiae s.l, followed by banana, mango, and melon, with sugarcane being the least attractive.

Existing computational models of Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) model long-term synaptic changes with varying degree of biological details. A common approach is to neglect the influence of short-term dynamics on long-term plasticity, which may represent an oversimplification for certain neuron types. Thus, there is a need for new models to investigate how short-term dynamics influence long-term plasticity. To this end, we introduce a novel phenomenological model, the Short-Long-Term STDP (SL-STDP) rule, which directly integrates short-term dynamics with postsynaptic long-term plasticity. We fit the new model to layer 5 visual cortex recordings and study how the short-term plasticity affects the firing rate frequency dependence of long-term plasticity in a single synapse. Our analysis reveals that the pre- and postsynaptic frequency dependence of the long-term plasticity plays a crucial role in shaping the self-organization of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their information processing through the emergence of sinks and source nodes. We applied the SL-STDP rule to RNNs and found that the neurons of SL-STDP network self-organized into distinct firing rate clusters, stabilizing the dynamics and preventing connection weights from exploding. We extended the experimentation by including homeostatic balancing, namely weight normalization and excitatory-to-inhibitory plasticity and found differences in degree correlations between the SL-STDP network and a network without the direct coupling between short-term and long-term plasticity. Finally, we evaluated how the modified connectivity affects networks' information capacities in reservoir computing tasks. The SL-STDP rule outperformed the uncoupled system in majority of the tasks and including excitatory-to-inhibitory facilitating synapses further improved information capacities. Our study demonstrates that short-term dynamics-induced changes in the frequency dependence of long-term plasticity play a pivotal role in shaping network dynamics and link synaptic mechanisms to information processing in RNNs.", "date": "2025-11-07", "journal": ""}

We identified two leads (cjDAE8, cjDAE4) by systemic AAV delivery and dual-color fluorescence screening in mice.

Once learning was consolidated, DN population activity preceded that of PCs, suggesting a progressive transfer of information from the cerebellar cortex to the nuclei, where long-term memory traces are stabilized. Spike-time analyses revealed that temporal regularity and bursts provide coding dimensions independent of firing rate and dynamically modulated across learning.

In instrumental settings, discriminative stimuli (DSs) signal when a response will produce reward, while conditioned stimuli (CSs) are paired with reward delivery after responding. Basolateral amygdala (BLA) projections are known to mediate CS-guided reward seeking, but their role in DS-guided behaviour remains unclear despite DSs being uniquely effective in triggering reward seeking. Here, we used optogenetic stimulation of BLA projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core or prelimbic cortex (PrL) to probe their causal involvement in DS- and CS-guided sucrose seeking. Female and male rats learned to lever press during DS+ trials to obtain sucrose paired with a CS+, and to withhold responding during DS- trials where sucrose was unavailable. We then assessed sucrose seeking evoked by response-independent DS+ and CS+ presentations, without sucrose. The DS+ prompted the greatest increases in lever pressing, acting as a strong Pavlovian conditioned excitor. Cue-paired photostimulation of BLA[-&gt;]NAc core or BLA[-&gt;]PrL projections did not alter this effect. In a test of instrumental responding for conditioned reinforcement, rats lever pressed most for DS+ and CS+ presentations, with no effect of cue-type, indicating that the two cues gained comparable conditioned reinforcing value. While cue-paired photostimulation of BLA[-&gt;]NAc core neurons had no impact, photostimulation of BLA[-&gt;]PrL projections suppressed instrumental responding for both the DS+ and CS+.

A subset of RNN neurons exhibited dynamics similar to those of anterior claustral neurons during this behavior. These neurons formed a recurrent cluster, a structure supported by in vitro stimulation experiments in claustral brain slices. We analyzed the computational properties of this claustrum-like cluster via dimensionality reduction of population activity. The network showed nonlinear integration of temporally distributed inputs and increased synergistic information. Rather than settling into attractors, integrated information was dynamically encoded along continuously evolving neural trajectories. Notably, the evolving trajectories that reflected dynamic integration in the RNN model matched those approximated in claustral recordings, suggesting the models biological plausibility.

In hippocampus, an alternative form of plasticity driven by plateau potentials (behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity; BTSP) alters synaptic weights in a single trial to reorganize spatial representations.

Spontaneously occurring and experimentally induced plateaus rapidly and persistently modified L5 PN responses to visual stimuli. In acute slices, plateau potentials drove synapse-specific plasticity with few repetitions across seconds-long pairing intervals.
