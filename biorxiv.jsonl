R.; Heldrich, J.; Kim, K. P.; Hochwagen, A.", "abstract": "Crossover recombination supports meiotic chromosome inheritance and fertility by establishing chiasmata between homologous chromosomes prior to the first meiotic division. In addition to the physical exchange of DNA mediated by meiotic recombination, chiasma formation also involves restructuring of the underlying chromosome axis, possibly to help with chiasma maturation or to resolve chromosomal interlocks. Here, we identify condensin as an important regulator of axis remodeling in S. cerevisiae. Condensin is recruited near sites of meiotic crossover designation by pro-crossover factors but is largely dispensable for DNA exchange. Instead, condensin helps to create discontinuities in the meiotic chromosome axis by promoting removal of cohesin. In addition, chromosomes of condensin mutants exhibit unusually common parallel chromatin clouds and experience a chromosomal buildup of the conserved axis remodeler Pch2. Consistent with an important role of axis restructuring at crossover sites, the canonical anaphase-bridge phenotype of condensin mutants is partly rescued by redirecting meiotic DNA repair to sister chromatids instead of homologous chromosomes, suggesting that crossover-associated axis reorganization is important for faithful meiotic chromosome segregation.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Monosynaptic connectivity tracing with G-deleted rabies virus (RV) establishes synaptic input connectivity, but cannot distinguish networks at cell resolution. We implemented a barcoded {Delta}G rabies virus to introduce unique molecular tags - and make network tracing amenable to readout by RNA-sequencing. First, we optimized and characterized library complexity and uniformity, such that detection of specific barcodes can reliably distinguish the individual monosynaptic input networks of multiple infected neurons in parallel. To deploy the method at scale; to hundreds of cells and full-brain volume per experiment, we developed regions-of-interest network sequencing (ROInet-seq); an accessible, scalable and low-cost spatial assay. ROInet- seq combines routine fluorescent imaging and processing of fixed tissue sections with a simple molecular biology workflow to capture barcode sequences in relevant regions-of-interest, and ultimately describes single-neuron networks brain-wide. In cortical brain areas the assay revealed preserved regional network motives, including co-inputs to single cortical neurons from distant and local sites. Towards improved spatial resolution and simultaneous detection of transcriptomes and networks we finally sampled barcoded {Delta}G rabies virus-infected hippocampus on commercial spatial transcriptomics assays and reveal details of the regions' neurons local network architecture.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

However, the relationships between the gut microbiota, metabolome (microbial metabolites), and stool consistency in infants and young children remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the microbiota and metabolome of 618 stool samples from children aged 2.5 months (n = 360), 6 months (n = 229), 14 months (n = 274), and 30 months (n = 169) from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study, correlating these data with stool water content and parent-reported stool consistency. We found that breastfeeding had the strongest association with both stool consistency and fecal water content. We observed that the concentrations of newly discovered microbial bile acid amidates were associated with constipation and negatively correlated with stool water content. Partial versus exclusive breastfeeding was further linked to higher levels of specific bile acid amidates through mediation by constipation. Bile salt hydrolase, an enzyme involved in deconjugating primary bile acids and generating novel microbial bile acids, was also predicted to be negatively associated with stool water content. In addition, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly acetic acids, were positively associated with stool water content, whereas branched SCFAs showed a negative association. These findings suggest longer transit time appeared to allow more extensive bacterial metabolism of microbial metabolites, including the transformation of bile acid amidates. Here, we also observed that the relative abundances of specific genera such as Clostridium, Hungatella, and Lactobacillus were associated with firmer stool consistency. Overall, our results highlight the importance of documenting stool consistency in fecal metabolomics and microbiome research, and provide new insights into how breastfeeding, microbial metabolism, and gut transit time shape early-life gut development.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

In individuals with psychiatric disorders and high adversity exposure, we identified distinct alterations to glutamate-related synaptic functions, supported by histological quantification of >20,000 astrocytes. Early-life adversity exposure produced more pronounced cellular changes than adversity experienced later in life, and female cases displayed stronger transcriptomic associations than males with adversity exposure.

However, confounding factors such as age or gender call for stratified analysis, by creating sub-tables, which is common in bioscience, epidemiological, and social research, as well as in meta-analyses. Traditional methods for testing associations across strata, such as the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, struggle with small sample sizes and heterogeneity of effects between strata. Exact tests can address these issues, but are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, the Gamma Approximation of Stratified Truncated Exact (GASTE) test is proposed. It approximates the exact statistic of the combination of p-values with discrete support, leveraging the gamma distribution to approximate the distribution of the test statistic under stratification, providing fast and accurate p-value calculations, even when effects vary between strata. The GASTE method maintains high statistical power and low type I error rates, outperforming traditional methods by offering more sensitive and reliable detection. It is computationally efficient and broadens the applicability of exact tests in research fields with stratified binary data. The GASTE method is demonstrated through two applications: an ecological study of Alpine plant associations and a 1973 case study on admissions at the University of California, Berkeley.

Potential Oct4 interactors have been cataloged but the manner and significance of these interactions are incompletely defined. Oct4 is capable of binding to DNA in multiple configurations, however the relationship between these configurations and cofactor recruitment (and hence transcription output) are unknown. Here, we show that Oct4 interacts with common and unique proteins when bound to DNA in different configurations. A unique protein is Jade1, a component of HBO histone acetyltransferase complexes. Jade1 preferentially associates with Oct4 when bound to More palindromic Octamer-Related Element (MORE) DNA sequences that bind Oct4 dimers. Surprisingly, we find that the Oct4 N-terminal activation domain, rather than facilitating Jade1 binding, serves as an autoinhibitory domain that dampens the interaction. ChIP-seq using HBO1, the enzymatic component of the complex, identifies a preference for binding adjacent to Oct4 at MORE sites. Using purified recombinant proteins and nucleosome complexes, we show that the HBO1 complex acetylates histone H3K9 within nucleosomes more efficiently when Oct4 is co-bound to a MORE. An Oct4 mutant with superior MORE binding characteristics also shows superior ability to catalyze H3K9 acetylation. Jade1 knockdown reduces H3K9Ac at regions where Oct4 binds a MORE but not a simple octamer. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals that Oct4 bound to a MORE near the nucleosome entry/exit site partially unwinds DNA from nucleosome core particles, and identifies additional mass associated with the HBO1 complex. These results identify a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation by Oct4.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

However, there is a lack of general methods to quantify the uncertainty and stability of these predictions from various RNA velocity methods. Results: In this paper, we present a novel framework for evaluating the stability of RNA velocity estimates by generating two independent splits of the original data using negative binomial count splitting, which we call replicate coherence. We apply our workflow to five RNA velocity methods and three well-characterized datasets about mouse erythroid development, pancreatic endocrinogenesis, and human brain development. Our results highlight key differences between methods, identify inconsistencies such as reversed velocity flow between different RNA velocity methods, and demonstrate robustness when certain intermediary cell states are missing. Building on top of replicate coherence, we additionally propose a signal-to-random coherence metric that aids in selecting the most appropriate RNA velocity fit. We demonstrate that by selecting an RNA velocity fit with higher replicate coherence compared to the baseline, we can also uncover more informative gene pathways that correlate with the temporal dynamics. Overall, our framework is broadly applicable across RNA velocity methods and provides a robust way to assess and compare method performance. This generalizability makes our approach a crucial tool for selecting reliable RNA velocity methods across diverse biological contexts.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We evaluated three core tasks-generalization to unseen single-gene perturbations, prediction of combinatorial interactions, and transfer across cell types-using 24 metrics covering expression-level accuracy, relative changes, differential expression recovery, and distributional similarity. Across tasks, performance depended strongly on perturbation effect size and evaluation perspective: expression-level agreement was highest for small-effect perturbations resembling controls, whereas delta- and DE-based metrics improved with larger effects, providing clearer signals. Models shared a conservative bias, with fine-tuned foundation models compressing variance and underestimating synergistic effects in combinations. PerturbNet showed superior recovery of DE signatures in Tasks 1 and 2, while no method consistently generalized across cell types in Task 3, where dataset heterogeneity dominated outcomes.

While the canonical trans-interaction of the ligand and receptor on neighboring cells initiates forward signaling that brings about biological activities, their cis-interaction on the same cell attenuates the forward signaling, modulating the biological effects. Yet, non-canonical cis-interactions with heterotypic surface proteins and kinases regulate certain biological effects. In cancer, the canonical signaling is believed to be tumor suppressive, while the ligand-independent non-canonical signaling drives tumor progression and poor prognosis. Self-renewal ability of cancer cells is a major underlying cause of recurrence and poor prognosis of cancer. Using SILAC-based proteomics, we identified Ephrin-B1 signaling as a crucial regulator of oral cancer self-renewal. Though Ephrin-B1 is known to regulate normal stem cells, its role in cancer remains underexplored. Our biochemical analyses show that Ephrin-B1 binds to a nonconventional receptor EPHA2, which is known to regulate cancer stem cells (CSCs), though the mechanism is less explored. Contrary to the belief that the cis-interaction of receptors and ligands is a means to block functional signaling, our immunoprecipitation, FRET facilitated photoswitching analysis, proximity ligation assay, and in vitro kinase assay provide evidence for the Ephrin-B1-EPHA2 cis-interaction leading to the phosphorylation of EphrinB1 at Y324/329 and Y317. Extreme limiting dilution assay in vitro and in vivo confirmed that this cis-interaction promotes CSC enrichment. Substantiating our in vitro results, mouse orthotopic models showed that Ephrin-B1/EPHA2 interaction regulates prognosis. The clinical relevance of the finding was validated using a TCGA data set and immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarray using samples from oral cancer patients with recurrence in comparison to patients, who showed disease-free survival. Given that Ephrin-B interacts with EphB for normal stem cell homeostasis, this unconventional EPHA2/Ephrin-B1 cis-interaction, specifically manifested in CSC niches, might serve as an attractive target for therapy, warranting further validation.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Here we focus on the evolution of this class of isolating mechanism, behavioural sexual isolation, through the empirical study of two closely related species of small marine isopods. The males of Jaera albifrons and J. praehirsuta similarly engage females in tactile courtship by brushing a specific region of the female's back, but they do so with divergent sets of specialised setae and spines, and female choice results in strong reproductive isolation. Using bi-allelic SNP genotypes obtained from double-digest RAD sequencing of individuals from natural populations and controlled crosses, we found that secondary contacts between J. albifrons and J. praehirsuta resulted in different levels of heterospecific gene flow depending on the ecological context. Comparison of the genomic landscapes of differentiation in the two most contrasting situations (extremely low heterospecific gene flow in one region of western France, but strong introgressive hybridisation in another), combined with linkage map analyses, allowed us to conclude that genomic regions impervious to interspecies gene flow are primarily located either on the sex chromosomes or on rearranged chromosomes (several fusion-scissions and one reciprocal translocation). These genomic regions show low recombination, and in two cases QTL analyses found genetic variation associated with several male courtship traits. These results suggest that a long period of allopatry may have allowed the divergent co-evolution of male traits and female preferences, with genetic bases located at least in part in non-recombining regions on sex chromosomes and rearranged chromosomes.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

However, protein modifications including deamidation of glutamine and asparagine, and conversion of glutamine or glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid, can change the sequence of peptides, leading to spurious taxonomic detections and potentially inaccurate archaeological interpretations. While a handful of examples of this phenomenon have been reported in the literature, the issue is potentially much wider reaching than currently realised. In reality, any time a peptide containing a deamidated glutamine or asparagine residue, an unmodified glutamic acid or aspartic acid residue, or a pyroglutamic acid modification is detected by proteomic search software, the sequence, and therefore potentially its taxonomy, may be incorrect, which could potentially lead to unsound archaeological interpretations. The Demodifier is a fast, open source tool which solves this issue by screening for modification-induced alternate peptide taxonomy, enabling archaeologists to make informed interpretations of the taxonomies of peptides detected in ancient samples. To assess its utility, the Demodifier is tested against an archaeological dataset containing all unique peptides reported in palaeoproteomic studies of dental calculus and vessels. The results reveal that modification-induced alternate peptide taxonomies are severely under-reported, occurring 15% more frequently than previously understood. Modifications were found to produce three different types of inaccurate taxonomic matches: those which yielded completely different taxonomic lowest common ancestors to the input peptide, those which were more taxonomically specific than the input peptide, and those which were less taxonomically specific than the input peptide. The Demodifier therefore enables the rapid detection of potentially inaccurate peptide taxonomies, avoiding spurious archaeological interpretations in future studies.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

While dairy remains a component of the human diet beyond weaning, the impact of continued milk supplementation on gut epithelial homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model, we show that continued milk-based feeding post-weaning promotes intestinal barrier function by enriching the commensal bacterium Dubosiella newyorkensis, which produces acetate to activate epithelial JNK2 signaling. This pathway enhances barrier integrity and suppresses inflammation induced by mild Dextran Sodium Sulphate (DSS) treatment. In contrast, feeding a lard-based high-fat diet or transient pharmacologic inhibition of JNK2 induces epithelial P38 activation, resulting in barrier disruption and inflammation. Importantly, the beneficial effects of milk were observed only if initiated during the weaning period, when the microbiome is in a metastable transitional state. Initiation of the same intervention two weeks after weaning led to P38 activation and inflammatory responses. These findings highlight the microbiome-dependent, stage-specific effects of diet and underscore the importance of early-life nutritional interventions for long-term gut health.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

BV-associated bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella timonensis damage the vaginal mucosa through the activity of sialidase enzymes that remodel the epithelial glycocalyx and degrade mucin glycoproteins. This damage may contribute to adverse health outcomes. However, whether BV-associated glycolytic enzymes also damage sperm has not yet been determined. Here, we show that sialidase-mediated glycocalyx remodeling of human sperm increases sperm susceptibility to damage and adversely affects their function in vitro. Specifically, we report that sperm motility was not adversely affected by sialidase treatment, but desialylated human sperm demonstrate increased susceptibility to agglutination and complement-mediated cytotoxicity as well as impaired transit through cervical mucus. Our results demonstrate mechanisms by which BV-associated sialidases affect sperm survival and function and potentially contribute to adverse reproductive outcomes such as infertility.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Transitions to fossorial lifestyles impose strong selective pressures favoring adaptations for underground life, such as increased skull ossification and reduced eye protrusion. Fossoriality may simultaneously relax constraints on vision leading to diminished visual capabilities. Caecilians (Gymnophiona), specialized, fossorial amphibians, possess reduced eyes covered by skin or bone. For years, these traits, along with the presence of a single photoreceptor expressing one functional opsin gene, have been interpreted as evidence of limited vision, including an inability to focus or perceive color. Our results challenge these assumptions: we identified the long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsin gene in 13 species of caecilians spanning 8 of 10 recognized families. Molecular evidence indicates that LWS is intact and transcribed in the eye of at least one species (Caecilia orientalis). However, the specific photoreceptor type expressing LWS remains uncertain, as our survey of cone phototransduction genes revealed a mosaic of losses, and anatomical observations from five families did not conclusively identify cone-like cells, though they revealed highly organized retinae even in families with vestigial eyes. Altogether, our results suggest that vision in caecilians may be underestimated and the role of light perception in their ecology is possible.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used time-resolved fMRI, group spatial independent component analysis (ICA), dual regression, and Gaussian curve fitting to examine both the spatial and temporal properties of whole-brain networks during a behavioral task. This task included trials that spanned over 25 seconds of watching short, emotionally evocative movie clips, making emotion-related decisions, and an intertrial rest period. We identified four whole-brain networks with unique spatial and temporal features that mapped onto different stages of the task. A network activated early in the course of the task included perceptual and affective evaluation regions, while two later networks supported semantic interpretation and decision-making, and a final network aligned with default mode activity. Both spatial and temporal properties of all four networks were modulated by the emotional content of the movie clips. Our findings extend current models of emotion by integrating temporal dynamics with large-scale network activity, offering a richer framework for understanding how emotions unfold across distributed circuits. Such temporal-spatial markers of emotional processing may prove valuable for identifying and tracking alterations in clinical populations.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Using single-molecule tracking and lattice light-sheet microscopy, we find that RNAPII cluster formation depends on transcription initiation, and that cluster lifetimes depend on transcriptional activity when not constrained by interphase duration. We show that single clusters are stably associated with active gene loci during transcription and that cluster intensities are strongly correlated with transcriptional output. Collectively our data and simulations on cluster formation kinetics show that RNAPII clusters reflect local accumulations of transcriptionally engaged polymerases and do not form through higher-order mechanisms such as phase separation.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

This study quantifies developmental differences in zebrafish embryos incubated at 26 degrees Celsius and 28 degrees Celsius, focusing on key endpoints (heartbeat onset, hatching time, eye size, yolk sac consumption, and body length). For this purpose, we recorded a high-resolution time series comprising hourly observations of early developmental stages and key events and bi-hourly observations of body length until 120 hours post fertilization. Additionally, we recorded a low-resolution time series at 72, 96, and 119 hours post fertilization for detailed measurements of eye size, yolk sac area, and body length. Embryos incubated at 26 degrees Celsius showed consistent delays in developmental stages compared to those at 28 degrees Celsius, with delays becoming more pronounced at later stages. Yolk sac consumption was delayed by about 19.8 hours at 26 degrees Celsius by 119 hours post fertilization, suggesting a delayed onset of independent feeding. These findings suggest that time-based regulatory limits for rearing zebrafish, such as the 120-hour threshold in German regulations (TierSchVerV), do not fully account for temperature-dependent development.

Here, we show that responses from neurons throughout the ferret auditory cortex are nearly completely unaffected by sounds falling beyond a time-limited \"integration window\". This window varies substantially across cells within the auditory cortex (~15 to ~150 ms), increasing substantially from primary to non-primary auditory cortex across all cortical layers, but is unaffected by the information rate of sound.

V.; Ragsdale, A.", "abstract": "In many taxa, levels of genetic diversity are observed to vary along their genome. The framework of background selection models this variation in terms of linkage to constrained sites, and recent applications have been able to explain a large portion of the variation in human genomes. However, these studies have also yielded conflicting results, stemming from two key limitations. First, existing models are inaccurate in the most critical region of parameter space (Nes~-1), where the reduction in diversity is sharpest. And second, they assume a constant population size over time. Here, we develop predictions for diversity under background selection based on the Hill-Robertson system of two-locus statistics, which allows for population size changes. We treat the joint effect of multiple selected loci independently, but we show that interference among them is well captured through local rescaling of mutation, recombination and selection in an iterative procedure that converges quickly. We further accommodate existing background selection theory to non-equilibrium demography, bridging the gap between weak and strong selection. Simulations show that our predictions are accurate over the entire range of selection coefficients. We characterize the temporal dynamics of linked selection under population size changes and demonstrate that patterns of diversity can be misinterpreted by other models. Specifically, biases due to the incorrect assumption of equilibrium carry over to downstream inferences of the distribution of fitness effects and deleterious mutation rate. Jointly modeling demography and linked selection therefore improves our understanding of the genomic landscape of diversity, which will help refine inferences of linked selection in humans and other species.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

V.; Geisler, C.; Janshoff, A.; Ko\u0308ster, S.", "abstract": "The eukaryotic cytoskeleton consists of three filament types: actin filaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments (IFs). IF proteins are expressed in a cell-type specific manner, and keratins are found in epithelial cells. In certain cell types, keratin forms a layer close to the membrane which may be referred to as an \"IF-cortex\". It is hypothesized that this IF-cortex arranges with radial bundles in a \"rim-and-spokes\" structure in epithelia. Based on this hypothesis, IFs and actin filaments might add complementary mechanical properties to the cortex. It was previously shown that single IFs in vitro remain undamaged at high strains and display a non-linear stretching behavior. We now ask the question of whether this unique force-extension behavior of single IFs is also relevant in the context of a filament network within a cell. We show that keratin-deficient (KO) MDCK II cells readily form 2D cell layers and 3D cysts and withstand high equibiaxial strains. High-resolution imaging using STED microscopy reveals altered actin cortex structures in KO cells, presumably in response to the missing keratin. We investigate the influence of the equibiaxial strain on the viscoelastic properties of wild-type (WT) and KO cells using atomic force microscopy. We find that the KO cells exhibit a higher pre-stress than the WT cells, likely due to the change of the cortical structure. Interestingly, both the pre-stress and the fluidity of the KO cells are altered already at intermediate strains, whereas the WT cells show a response only at high strain. Similarly, the KO cysts are stretched more easily at low strains than the WT cysts during injection experiments. The compressibility modulus is analyzed in a spatially resolved manner and we find this modulus to be increased at the cell rim, compared to the inside region, due to the geometry of the cell layer. Our results indicate that KO cells compensate for the missing keratin, but are nevertheless very sensitive to external strain, whereas the intricate interplay between the actin and keratin cortices in WT cells preserves the mechanical state and cell stability.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Binders with varying binding strengths were identified for all eight targets, including a case where no experimentally resolved target protein structure was available, demonstrating the highest level of precision compared to previous de novo antibody design reports. To further validate the designed antibodies, they were characterized in the IgG format for five distinct targets.

Furthermore, binders capable of distinguishing closely related protein subtypes or mutants were identified, demonstrating that the method can achieve high molecular specificity. Cryo-EM analysis experimentally validated the design's accuracy by confirming that the key binding interactions were precisely as designed.

This approach demonstrates glucose responsive CaMPARI2 labeling that correlates with insulin secretion. Using this novel high-throughput approach, we examine the relationship between islet size and calcium response.

However, urban green infrastructures (UGIs) can influence the distribution of disease vectors, potentially affecting vector-borne diseases (VBDs). UGIs may provide new suitable environments for urban vectors, while also creating opportunities to mitigate VBD risks through predation, competition, and dilution effects. This article examined the relationships between UGIs, vectors, and associated pathogens, impacting both human and animal health, highlighting knowledge gaps and identifying research priorities to support VBD risk mitigation measures and to guide smart urban planning and design. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines in three databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science). Selected articles involved (i) any aspect of a urban vector system, (ii) in UGIs, and (iii) statistical analysis of the effects of UGIs on VBD risk. Methods employed to characterize UGIs and VBDs were described and the identified impacts were summarized by vector group. Results: Among the 98 articles reviewed, most addressed mosquito-pathogen systems (66), tick-pathogen systems (29), and few other vector-borne pathogen systems (3), with studies often confined to a single city or several cities within the same country and focused on one vector group. Urban vegetation generally appeared to heighten the risk of tick-borne diseases. In contrast, the influence of UGIs on the risk of mosquito-borne diseases varied depending on the vector system and on the environmental and climatic context. The diversity of indicators used to assess UGIs and VBD risks may affect the observed impact on VBD risk. Conclusion: Given the increasing popularity of urban greening, it is crucial to investigate its potential implications for public health, and thereby urban planning decisions. However, the lack of standardized protocols complicates the accurate assessment of the effects of UGIs on the risk for VBD emergence and transmission and consequently, on potential mitigation measures.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

It inhibits multiple steps of the viral life cycle; however, the molecular details of the effect of LEN on capsid structure and the mechanistic steps of the inhibition are not understood. Recent studies show that intact cone-shaped capsids and capsids with LEN-induced breaks can dock at nuclear pore complexes (NPC), but only intact capsids enter the nucleus. In this work, we combined large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and live-cell imaging to investigate the stepwise mechanism of docking of LEN-treated capsids into the NPC. Capsids bound to substoichiometric concentrations of LEN can reach the NPC central channel. As the capsid advances to the nuclear end, lattice defects are formed at the pentamer-hexamer interface - primarily at the narrower end - leading to pentamer dissociation. Dissociation of pentamers is detrimental to capsid integrity, leading to both rupture of the narrow end and destabilization of the hexamer-hexamer interface. Structural analysis of LEN-capsid complexes in our simulations demonstrates heterogeneous hyperstabilization and loss of the essential pliability of the capsid protein lattice. Live-cell imaging of HIV-1 cores labeled with two different fluorescent markers showed that LEN-treated ruptured capsids were docked at the NPC but were not imported into the nucleus. We conclude that LEN contributes to the loss of capsid elasticity and integrity, inhibiting HIV-1 nuclear entry and replication.

This study reports on the role of FN and its molecular conformation in mediating macromolecular assembly of synovial fluid ad-layers. FN films as precursor films on functionalized surfaces, a model of FN's articular cartilage surface, adsorbed and retained different amounts of synovial fluid (SF). FN conformational changes were induced by depositing FN at pH 7 (extended state) or at pH 4 (unfolded state) on self-assembled monolayers on gold-coated quartz crystals, followed by adsorption of diluted SF (25%) onto FN precursor films. Mass density, thin film compliance, surface morphologies, and adsorbed FN films' secondary and tertiary structures reveal pH-induced differences. FN films deposited at pH 4 were thicker, more rigid, showed a more homogeneous morphology, and had altered alpha-helix and beta-sheet content, compared to FN films deposited at pH 7. FN precursor films deposited at pH 7 adsorbed and retained more synovial fluid than those at pH 4, revealing the importance of FN conformation at the articular cartilage surface to bind and maintain a thin lubricating and wear protective layer of synovial fluid constituents.

The predicted structure and experimental data both show that the N-terminus of TFIIIA-7ZF binds to the left terminal domain of PSTVd, while the C-terminus interacts with Rpb2. Interestingly, AlphaFold3 also predicts the bending at PSTVd loop 8 in the TFIIIA-7ZF/PSTVd complex. Replacing this loop 8 with a rigid double-stranded conformation impairs the TFIIIA-7ZF/PSTVd interaction. Altogether, our demonstrate an active form of heterogenous organization of the essential Pol II enzyme in vivo and provide structural insights into the organization of Pol II transcription complex on RNA template.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

The underlying neural mechanisms and how it is influenced by individual sensitivity to feedback are not known. We measured cognitive flexibility under uncertainty with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Using a behavioral sequential learning model, we show that variability in cognitive flexibility is predicted by individual reward and punishment sensitivity to feedback and anticipation and exploration tendencies. Uncovering their brain oscillatory signatures showed that individual learning speed is predicted by suppressed alpha-beta (7-32 Hz) and increased broad-band gamma (52-96 Hz) amplitudes along with concurrent large-scale alpha (7-13 Hz) desynchronization. Importantly, these oscillatory sub-processes were explained by individual levels of distinct feedback sensitivities.

In our dynamic and constantly changing environment, we continuously need to adapt our behavior, either due to external (e.g., a change of wind) or internal factors (e.g., muscle noise). Motor adaptation is the process of recalibration of movements in response to such perturbation. It activates when an agent needs to change their movement in response to a perceived error. It has been proposed that in order to perform motor adaptation, the brain continuously updates an error sensitivity signal that controls how much is learned from a past error. Such error sensitivity reflects the speed of learning, and understanding its dynamics is crucial to promoting efficient learning. In our experiment, healthy participants performed a visuomotor adaptation task requiring reaching multiple targets using a joystick. They experienced two periods of stable perturbations and two periods of random perturbations. In agreement with past research, we found that error sensitivity is lower in unstable environments. Moreover, error sensitivity is higher in a stable environment without perturbation than in a stable environment with perturbations. We observed a continuous increase of the error sensitivity within a stable perturbation environment. Finally, continuous spatial (across target locations) and temporal (across trials with same target) generalization of learning is present not only in stable but also in the random environment.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

While 3D Z-stack imaging offers high-resolution data, the complexity of 3D structures makes direct interpretation and manual annotation challenging and time-consuming, especially for large datasets. Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is a common strategy to create more interpretable 2D representations, but this inevitably leads to artificial overlaps between structures, significantly hindering accurate automated segmentation of individual instances by conventional methods or standard deep learning tools. To address this critical challenge in 2D projection analysis, we developed DeMemSeg, a deep learning pipeline based on Mask R-CNN, specifically designed to segment overlapping membrane structures, called prospore membranes (PSMs) during yeast sporulation. DeMemSeg was trained on a custom-annotated dataset, leveraging a systematic image processing workflow. Our optimized model accurately identifies and delineates individual, overlapping PSMs, achieving segmentation performance and derived morphological measurements that are statistically indistinguishable from expert manual annotation. Notably, DeMemSeg successfully generalized to segment PSMs from unseen data acquired from gip1{triangleup} mutant cells, capturing the distinct morphological defects in PSMs. DeMemSeg thus provides a robust, automated solution for objective quantitative analysis of complex, overlapping membrane morphologies directly from widely used 2D MIP images, offering a practical tool and adaptable workflow to advance cell biology research.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Although studies have investigated dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition in breast cancer, they have not determined biomarkers which predict success. We present evidence of a patient subset with EGFR amplification and PI3Kinase pathway mutations in breast cancer which can be synergistically targeted by dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition. This study identified that EGFR amplification occurs in approximately 1-5% of breast cancer patients with shorter overall survival compared to unamplified patients. Up to 71% of EGFR amplified tumors have activating mutations in the PI3K pathway. Dual EGFR/PI3K inhibition more dramatically reduced mTOR and AKT signaling in BT20 and MDA-MB-468 cells which both have EGFR amplification and PI3K pathway activating mutations, compared to control cells. Dual inhibition synergistically reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-468 and BT20 compared to control. Single agent therapy in a BT20 xenograft model reduced tumor volume, however only the combination statistically significantly reduced tumor volume compared to control.

Identifying new genes involved in the interaction between V. vinifera and B. cinerea appears to be a promising strategy for enhancing grapevine resistance in future breeding programs. During pathogen infection, plasma membrane-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are responsible for detecting conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Among PRRs, members of the LysM receptor-like kinase family are well known to mediate the recognition of fungal MAMPs and triggering plant immune signaling pathways. Interestingly, a novel member of this receptor family, named VvLYK6, was identified in grapevine as the most highly upregulated during B. cinerea infection. To investigate the role of VvLYK6 in plant immunity, we conducted overexpression studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and grapevine cell suspensions. Overexpression of VvLYK6 led to a reduction in chitin-induced MAPK activation, decreased expression of defense-related genes, reduced callose deposition, and increased plant susceptibility to fungal pathogens in A. thaliana. Based on these findings, we conclude that VvLYK6 acts as a negatively regulator of chitin-triggered immune responses, suggesting its potential role as a susceptibility gene during fungal infections.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

M.; Van Domselaar, E.; Mitchell, Z. H.; Deelen, L.

Here, we demonstrate that SALL4, a transcription factor highly expressed in cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) and associated with syndromes featuring craniofacial anomalies, plays a critical role in this early regulatory process. Using SALL4-haploinsufficient human iPSC models that recapitulate clinical haploinsufficiency, we show that SALL4 directly interacts with the BAF chromatin remodeling complex at the neuroectodermal stage, specifically when neural crest lineage specific gene expression is induced from the neural plate border. The SALL4-BAF interaction at this stage is essential for the recruitment of BAF to CNCC-induction enhancers. Without functional SALL4, BAF is not loaded at chromatin, leaving CNCC enhancers inaccessible. Consequently, the cells cannot undergo proper CNCC induction and specification due to persistent enhancer repression, despite normal neuroectodermal and neural plate progression. Moreover, by performing SALL4 isoform-specific depletion, we demonstrate that the SALL4A is the isoform essential for CNCC induction and specification, and that SALL4B cannot compensate for SALL4A loss in this developmental process. In summary, our findings reveal SALL4 as essential regulator of BAF-dependent enhancer activation during early stages of neural crest development, providing molecular insights into SALL4-associated craniofacial anomalies.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Molecular evidence has suggested that chrysophytes are commonly infected by giant viruses, but no isolates of such viruses have been reported. Here, we describe the chrysophyte-infecting virus Chrysophyceae Clade H virus SA1 (ChrysoHV). Both mixotrophic host and virus were isolated from surface waters in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. The ChrysoHV capsid (290 {+/-} 40 nm diameter) is associated with a loose, sac-like membrane that extends its effective diameter (720 {+/-} 120 nm), and presents a long, thin tail extending 1,200 ({+/-} 240) nm in length. This morphology has not been previously observed in other virus isolates or environmental surveys. The sequenced, assembled genome is 1.19 Mbp, and phylogenetic analysis places ChrysoHV as the third cultivated member of the Aliimimivirinae subfamily in the Mimiviridae family of giant viruses. ChrysoHV is the first cultivated member of Aliimimivirinae to encode a rhodopsin, and the most similar rhodopsin sequences from cultivated organisms derive from marine bacteria in the genus Pelagibacter. The rhodopsin homolog in ChrysoHV may thus represent a new lineage of viral rhodopsins. The ChrysoHV genome also contains nine genes, mostly related to nutrient uptake, with the closest known homologs in the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus. Therefore, lateral gene transfer may be occurring between abundant marine bacterial clades and giant viruses, a process that may be promoted by phagotrophic mixotrophs as both giant viruses and bacterial prey are taken into the cell.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We investigated the relative contributions of two hypothesized transmission routes: sexual inheritance (via reproductive organs) and asexual inheritance (via the plant vascular system). To do that, we sampled shoot endophytes both before bloom and at seed maturity stages, apple flower ovaries and pollen sacs, and mature seeds from field-grown apple trees (Malus domestica BORKH. cv 'Gala Galaxy Selecta'). We showed that bacterial richness, diversity and composition differ among tissue types, with shoots before bloom harboring a higher diversity than ovary and pollen. Source tracking revealed that both sexual (30.3%) and asexual (23.8%) pathways contributed to seed microbiome assembly, with shoots at seed maturity being the dominant source. Notably, a large proportion (49.5%) of the seed microbiome originated from unknown sources. Lastly, the transmission pathways significantly differed among bacterial genera, with Pseudomonas primarily linked to shoots, Rhizobacter to pollen and Burkholderia to the ovary.

We developed two novel functional assessments of short-term spatial memory that were administered by community science participants in a sample of 6,753 dogs through the Dog Aging Project. We compared data generated by community scientists to those gathered by research professionals, estimated relationships between age and task performance, and tested the hypothesis that associations between age and cognitive performance vary by dog body mass, as a proxy for expected lifespan. Community scientists generated similar data to research professionals and both cognitive tasks were sensitive to age-related deficits, beginning in midlife. Relationships between age and cognitive function were highly similar across small and large dogs and, for both tasks, comparison of models with and without an interaction between age and body mass yielded decisive evidence for the model without the interaction. Large dogs exhibit accelerated aging across many traits, and so the lack of evidence for accelerated cognitive aging raises the possibility that their large size confers a neuroprotective advantage. We consider possible mechanisms underlying this effect and address how experimental studies of dog cognition using community science methods can support future research on mechanisms of brain and cognitive aging.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

In this study, we developed mathematical models and computer applications to investigate one- and two-allele models of habitat-preference barriers in sympatric populations under disruptive ecological selection. We examined two spatial arrangements: an open-space model inspired by sympatric cichlid fishes that meet in open water with niche habitats that are small relative to lake size, and a no-open-space model inspired by sympatric hawthorn and apple maggot flies that move directly between trees without lingering in midair. Next, we examined coupling between habitat-preference barriers and a two-allele mating-bias barrier developed in a prior study to analyze how their invasion and coupling dynamics could lead to stronger RI. Our findings confirm that habitat preference is an independent mechanism capable of establishing initial premating barriers in sympatric speciation. Moreover, it can couple with additional barriers, such as those based on mating-trait discrimination, to enhance overall RI. Because habitat preference is an adaptive barrier mechanism, its invasion and coupling are driven by selection pressures arising from maladaptive hybrid loss, and it is readily reversed when disruptive ecological selection weakens. The one-allele model is easier to evolve than the two-allele model because it is immune to recombination by gene flow. Habitat-preference barriers can facilitate the emergence of mating-bias barriers. Open-space systems provide fewer opportunities for inter-niche encounters and tend to result in stronger RI compared to no-open-space systems. By elucidating the habitat-preference mechanism, our study reinforces the important role of habitat-preference barriers in sympatric speciation. It also provides insights into a wide range of premating isolating mechanisms--temporal, behavioral, and mechanical--that function similarly by reducing mating encounters.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Marchantia polymorpha spores are single cell structures formed at meiosis. On germination, spores divide asymmetrically to form a basal cell that terminally differentiates and an apical germ cell that divides into an early cell mass on which a flat prothallus develops. A single stem cell niche (meristem) forms de novo at the margin of the prothallus to drive development of the thallus plant body. Here we show that the prothallus forms at the apical pole of the early cell mass and represses the formation of other prothalli. LOW AUXIN RESPONSIVE (MpLAXR) marks this apical pole indicating that an auxin minimum is located at the site of organogenesis. Light is required for the formation of the apical auxin minimum and for the development of the prothallus from the early cell mass. Disrupting the apical auxin minimum by exogenous auxin treatment suppresses the transitions to the prothallus and formation of the meristem from the early cell mass. A similar molecular program operates during plant regeneration from a single differentiated thallus cell, which regains stemness (pluripotency) upon surgical isolation from surrounding tissues; the isolated cell divides forming an early cell mass that develops a local auxin minimum where a flat prothallus with a single meristem forms.

Here, we present a comprehensive resource annotating conserved retroviral domains across 120,000+ ORFs derived from internal HERV regions. Using a reproducible pipeline based on HMMER and InterProScan, we identified over 17,000 domain hits - primarily from pol genes such as reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and protease - and quantified their structural conservation. Hundreds of domains exceed 95% alignment coverage, revealing a surprising abundance of full-length, retrovirus-like domains in both young and ancient HERV families. While the HERVK subfamily retains the most complete polyprotein architecture - including 13 loci with nearly intact Gag, Pol, and Env domains - many full-length Pol domains are also found in other families such as HERVH, HERVW, and HERVE. Our high-resolution annotations recover conserved catalytic motifs in Pol domains and transmembrane features in Env, enabling fine-grained functional interpretation.

The most prominent addition to SAGA in metazoans compared to yeast is a 150kDa splicing-factor module (SPL). SPL is also a part of the U2snRNP but its role in SAGA is elusive, partially due to absence of high-resolution structural information regarding its incorporation into the complex. In yeast, subunit TAF5 and TAF6 of SAGA are shared with the general transcription factor TFIID. In metazoans, gene duplication created proteins that occur only in SAGA (TAF5L and TAF6L) or in TFIID (TAF5 and TAF6). What functions of SAGA benefit from this protein specialization is unclear. Here we report the structure of endogenous human SAGA purified via an affinity-ligand from cells that were not disturbed by any genomic engineering tools such as CRISPR-Cas9. Our work reveals the high-resolution structure of SPL and of the TAF6L HEAT repeat domain that provides the SPL with a docking surface. We elucidate how SPL and the HEAT repeats are incorporated into SAGA. We find multiple major differences between TAF6L/TAF5L and the canonical paralogues that are directly implicated in structural re-arrangements required to accommodate SPL. Furthermore, SPL binding to SAGA is very different and occupying much less interaction surface than to U2snRNP. However, the two cases still share similar sequences in a helix that is deeply inserted into the SPL. The seemingly weaker interaction of SPL with SAGA raises the possibility that SAGA serves to relay this module to the splicing machinery. Our structure also suggests mutations that could uncouple SPL from SAGA to further interrogate the role of this module.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

The critically endangered white-winged wood duck (WWWD) Asarcornis scutulata has experienced substantial population declines, local extirpations and fragmentation of its former range in South-East Asia, making it one of the rarest birds in the world. Like other rare species, WWWD declines have led to the initiation of captive breeding programs, but these have been hampered by the WWWDs' high susceptibility to Mycobacterium avium, avian tuberculosis (TB). In this study we describe genome-wide patterns of diversity to understand the WWWD's demographic and phylogeographic history, inbreeding in the wild and in captivity, and the causes of TB susceptibility. Captive birds, which originated from northeast India, are genetically differentiated from wild birds sampled in Sumatra, Indonesia, likely reflecting long-standing phylogeographic structure. Demographic analyses revealed that long-term (Pleistocene) population declines preceded anthropogenic declines, a pattern shared with other codistributed, forest-dependent species. All sampled WWWD populations had extremely low genetic diversity but wild-sampled birds retained higher Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) diversity, reflecting important functional diversity in the wild. Genetic diversity has eroded over time in captivity and importantly, birds with higher levels of inbreeding succumb earlier to TB infections, suggesting inbreeding depression. Finally, by comparing gene expression between susceptible WWWD and resistant redhead ducks Aythya americana we identify possible mechanisms of TB susceptibility in WWWD.

However, traditionally used prokaryotic CFPS systems show limitations to produce complex proteins requiring post-translational modifications, whilst eukaryotic CFPS systems have historically been difficult to scale and show low protein yields. In this work, we establish the site-specific introduction of ncaas into complex proteins with the high-yielding and scalable eukaryotic tobacco BY-2 CFPS system (BYL), commercialised as ALiCE(R). The tyrosine transferase from Escherichia coli (eTyrT) was tested for amber suppression-mediated ncaa incorporation in BYL. eTyrT showed high incorporation yields of up to 2mg/ml recombinant protein for the azido-tyrosine and alkyne-tyrosine ncaas, with linear scalability up to 10ml without any losses in protein yield. We applied ncaa incorporation in BYL to enable click chemistry bioconjugation of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of influenza hemagglutinin to pre-assembled hepatitis B core (HBc) virus-like particles (VLPs). BYL efficiently produced the alkyne-modified RBD and azido-modified HBc VLPs, and their conjugation via copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) led to structurally intact, RBD-coated particles. VLP-RBD conjugates could efficiently hemagglutinate chicken erythrocytes where the individual proteins could not, proving both the sialic-acid binding activity of the RBD and its multivalent presentation by the HBc VLP. Finally, when used to vaccinate mice the conjugated RBD-VLPs showed a greater protection against live influenza challenge than free RBD.

Popular Euclidean embedding methods, such as UMAP and t-SNE, as well as domain-specific approaches like PHATE, distort hierarchical relationships in low dimensions, leading to a decrease in performance with growing tree depth. Hyperbolic geometry, which can represent trees with high accuracy in low dimensions, provides a natural remedy. However, existing hyperbolic methods, such as Poincare Maps (PM), lose accuracy in deeper trees and require extensive feature engineering and memory. We present Contrastive Poincare Maps (CPM), a self-supervised hyperbolic encoder that leverages contrastive learning in hyperbolic space to efficiently learn robust low-dimensional representations from scRNA-seq data. On synthetic trees with up to 5 generations and 34,000 individuals, CPM cuts distortion by > 99% and requires 13-fold less memory relative to PM. We further demonstrate CPM's utility on three biological case studies. CPM uncovers accurate hierarchies across 9 developmental stages in the mouse gastrulation dataset comprising 116,312 cells, disentangles global multi-lineage hierarchies in the chicken cardiogenesis dataset while preserving intra-lineage developmental trends, and enables sampling-density-invariant hierarchical analysis in the mouse hematopoiesis dataset. By leveraging hyperbolic geometry in combination with contrastive learning, CPM delivers a scalable framework that preserves hierarchical dependencies in developmental lineages, accelerates exploratory data analysis and opens new avenues for biological insights into developmental processes using scRNA-seq data.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

In the present study, our goal is to predict the progression of selected aging phenotypes in a given healthy individual as one continues aging past 65 years. Therefore, we developed a novel framework called Dynamic Views of Aging with conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (or DyViA-GAN) which is capable of predicting the plausible personalized trajectories of a selected aging phenotype conditioned on the available measurements of the phenotype at a few initial time instances, and additional covariates. Given the prevalence of osteoporosis in the aging population, we selected total hip Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of a healthy individual as the phenotype of interest, and baseline individual Body Mass Index (BMI) as the covariate. We trained DyViA-GAN on a publicly available longitudinal dataset of a large cohort of mostly white women in the United States of age 65 years or above. Thus, it generated, for each individual, continuous phenotype trajectories, along with a corresponding region of acceptable predictions, for an age range of 66 to 98 years, for eight different combinations both with and without involving the covariate. Our results clearly demonstrate the potential of generative deep learning frameworks in healthspan research.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Changes in cognitive flexibility are a promising candidate mechanism underlying age-related changes in cognition, but the causes of inflexibility in older adulthood remain elusive. Here we focus on a core feature of flexible cognition: the ability to rapidly transition between different cognitive states when required to do so by changes in the environment or our goals (e.g., moving between states of low vs. high attentional focus). We put forward a dynamical systems model proposing that aging-related cognitive inflexibility arises in part from slowing of transitions between distinct configurations of cognitive control, even when the task is held constant. To test this model, we had participants across the lifespan perform a cognitive task under different performance goals, which induced different control configurations. Using computational modeling, we were able to measure dynamic changes in control configurations to meet different performance goals. This allowed us to simultaneously test three potential sources of age-related decreases in cognitive flexibility: 1) diminished control capacity in environments that require more switching; 2) diminished range of control adjustments; and 3) slower transitions between control states. Of these, we found that age was only associated with transition speed. When given sufficient time to maintain a given goal, older adults were able to adjust control to a similar extent as younger adults; however, when goals changed more frequently, they were more likely to undershoot their target control configuration for that goal, consistent with predictions from our model for longer transition times. Our findings demonstrate that cognitive dynamics, rather than the overall reductions in cognitive ability, are critical for understanding the mechanisms through which cognitive inflexibility arises in older adulthood.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins play critical roles in control of genome structure and in regulating transcription across eukaryotes. Their essential nature, however, has made it difficult to define exactly how these functions are mediated. The chromatin remodeller CHD4 has been shown to be capable of sliding nucleosomes in vitro, and to regulate chromatin accessibility and gene expression in vivo. Using an inducible depletion system, here we identify a second mechanism of action for CHD4 in actively restricting the residence time of transcription factors on chromatin. Together these activities result in distinct, context-dependent outcomes: at highly accessible regulatory elements, CHD4 limits transcription factor binding to maintain regulatory function, while at low-accessibility euchromatic regions, it prevents transcription factor engagement and sustains chromatin compaction, thereby silencing cryptic enhancers. Collectively, these mechanisms enable CHD4 to reduce transcriptional noise while preserving the responsiveness of active regulatory networks.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Semenogelin-1 (SEMG1) is the predominant protein in the seminal plasma and a major structural component of the semen coagulum in humans and mice. SEMG1 binds EPPIN (Epididymal protease inhibitor) on the sperm surface, transiently inhibiting the acquisition of sperm motility and hyperactivation after ejaculation. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying SEMG1-mediated inhibition of sperm hyperactivation remain unclear. We hypothesize that the SEMG1 effects are associated with the inhibition of CatSper, a sperm-specific calcium channel crucial for triggering hyperactivation. We observed that recombinant mouse SEMG1 (mSEMG1) inhibited both progressive motility and hyperactivation in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, hyperactivation was not recovered upon NH4Cl-induced alkalinization, suggesting that the effects of mSEMG1 are downstream of capacitation-associated intracellular alkalinization. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that mSEMG1 impaired CatSper currents at concentrations near its IC50 for inhibiting sperm hyperactivation. Recombinant mSEMG1 truncations mSEMG1Q32-V118 and mSEMG1R98-G375, but not mSEMG1Y221-G375, independently inhibited sperm hyperactivation and CatSper currents similar to full-length mSEMG1. However, only mSEMG1R98-G375 displayed similar EPPIN-binding capacity comparable to full-length mSEMG1, whereas mSEMG1Q32-V118 and mSEMG1Y221-G375 showed only minor binding. Our findings reveal that mouse SEMG1 comprises two distinct functional domains within the Q32-V118 and R98-S220 sequences, which contribute to the inhibition of sperm hyperactivation by targeting the CatSper channel, both independently and dependent on EPPIN binding. These functional domains represent promising prototypes for the design of spermiostatic molecules, offering additional avenues for non-hormonal male contraception targeting spermatozoa.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

These mechanisms are often confounded, yet dissociating them is essential for understanding neural circuit computations. We addressed this by performing two-photon calcium imaging from distinct cell types (excitatory, VIP and SST) in layer 2/3 of visual (VIS) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), while awake mice passively viewed audio-visual stimuli under temporal contexts with different inter-stimulus interval (ISI) distributions. Computational modeling revealed distinct functional clusters of neurons, including stimulus-activated (ramp-down) and stimulus-inhibited (ramp-up) categories, with distinct kinetics and area/cell-type biases. Importantly, all functional clusters were invariant to temporal predictability, shifted immediately when temporal statistics changed, and were identical between naive and experienced mice. Population decoding revealed that clusters with heterogeneous kinetics differed in how well they represented interval information, such that together they tiled elapsed time and produced a distributed, learning-independent population code for time. These results provide strong evidence against temporal predictive processing in Vis/PPC under passive conditions and instead demonstrate intrinsic coding of interval timing, redefining the mechanistic origin of ramping and omission-related activity in sensory cortex. We discuss how these dynamics align with stimulus-reset attractor frameworks, and propose that temporal predictive processing is more likely implemented in other circuits or recruited in Vis/PPC during task-engaged behavior.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

The gene s variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), with high GC content, makes it largely inaccessible to standard sequencing. As a result, both the reference sequence and natural variation in this region remain poorly defined, complicating mutation detection and data interpretation. Standard methods also fail to pinpoint the exact VNTR unit affected, limiting insight into mutation mechanisms and genotype/phenotype correlations. Methods: We employed Single Molecule, Real Time (SMRT) sequencing and characterized the genomic sequence of MUC1 in 300 individuals including 279 individuals from 143 families suspected of having ADTKD MUC1. We compared these results to those obtained using the CLIA approved mass spectrometry based probe extension (PE) assay, which specifically detect the most prevalent 59dupC mutation. We correlated the structural features of the MUC1 VNTR with the rate of kidney function decline in affected individuals. Results: We identified MUC1 consensus sequences for 205 unique VNTR alleles, with 9 distinct types of frameshift mutations present on 52 distinct mutated VNTR alleles. MUC1 frameshift mutations were identified in 71 of 143 families (50%) with suspected ADTKD, comprising 135 genetically affected individuals (48%). The SMRT assay exhibited complete concordance and revealed that the PE assay is capable of detecting frameshift mutations in approximately 85% of affected families. The constellation of VNTR structures supports a genotype progression model, in which fast progressors exhibit a significantly lower number of repeat units on the wild type allele and a higher number of repeats on the mutation bearing allele, including an increased number of frameshifted repeat units. Conclusions: SMRT sequencing outperforms current diagnostic methods for ADTKD-MUC1 and reveals the prognostic value of VNTR structures. Although their contribution to disease progression is modest (~6% variance explained), it remains biologically and clinically meaningful.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

To support this profound synaptogenesis, Purkinje cells generated thousands of transient parallel fiber-oriented filopodia that received nascent synapses from parallel fibers. Importantly, we find that granule cells initiate synaptic output onto Purkinje cells only after receiving mossy fiber input, revealing a sequential, input-dependent logic for circuit assembly. In sharp contrast to the concurrent pruning of climbing fiber inputs, parallel fiber connectivity expanded and became highly individualized during development. Despite anatomical overlap, neighboring Purkinje cells share significantly fewer parallel fiber inputs than expected by chance. Moreover, parallel fibers themselves diverged spatially, further enforcing selective input allocation and resulting in highly specific parallel fiber cohorts for each Purkinje cell. Our findings uncover a mechanistic sequence in which early afferent activity and transient cellular structures guide the selective wiring and expansion of parallel fiber input to Purkinje cells, establishing developmental principles that ensure functional specificity in the mature brain.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

J.; Goriely, A.", "abstract": "The brain and testis share a surprisingly high number of molecular and cellular similarities. We have previously hypothesised that, throughout evolution, many genetic variants contributing to brain size expansion first arose in spermatogonia where they conferred a selective advantage to the male germline stem cells via a process analogous to oncogenesis - known as 'selfish spermatogonial selection'. Upon transmission of the mutant sperm to the next generation, these selfish variants became constitutive, disproportionately accumulating in signalling pathways active in both spermatogenesis and neurogenesis and which regulate stem cell proliferation. While we believe these observations supporting a close association between germline and brain development are compelling, research in this area is stymied by the relative scarcity of spermatogonia and the inherent stochasticity of the single-cell transcriptomic methods used to profile them. Accordingly, the molecular signatures of spermatogonia are incompletely understood, and their similarity with those of the brain difficult to assess. To support further work on the testis-brain relationship, we combine re-analyses of 34 adult human single-cell testis datasets with data from the Human Protein Atlas to assess the extent to which genes functionally associated with brain growth and development are expressed within testicular cell types. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that of thousands of proteins functionally associated with the brain, the majority are not only expressed in male germ cells, but show particular enrichment in spermatogonia.

Here, we use genome-scale CRISPR screening to systematically identify regulators of AHR signaling in hepatocytes. The resulting datasets recapitulate the core AHR signaling pathway and identify a large network of regulators. Many of these factors have roles beyond AHR signaling, reflecting that AHR signaling is deeply integrated into human cell biology. We further dissect this network to reveal novel modes of regulation of AHR expression, protein levels, and signaling. For example, we find that the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 sustains AHR signaling by counteracting degradation of ligand-bound AHR. Finally, we identify components of the AHR regulatory network that are specific to cell types and ligands as potential nodes to manipulate AHR signaling in a targeted manner for therapeutic benefit.

Patterns of differential transcription at tREs can be leveraged to identify upstream regulators and link enhancers to their target genes. But the low transcription levels and high variability in tREs makes identifying high-confidence differentially transcribed elements challenging. Results: We present Mu Counts and TFEA-LE, two algorithms for robust identification of differentially transcribed tREs. The first step in accurate identification of differentially transcribed tREs is to obtain accurate RNA lengths and therefore counts over these regions. To this end, we developed a method of accurate length inference (LIET-EMG) as well as a rapid method for counting reads over tREs (Mu Counts). Armed with newly identified and quantified tREs, TFEA-LE then integrates motif information to simultaneously identify responsive tREs and their likely upstream regulators. We show improved precision and recall over general-purpose tools (e.g. DESeq2) in detecting p53-responsive tREs. We then clarify TF-specific responses within multi-TF perturbations in lung cells. Finally we show that the TFEA-LE approach improves TF activity inference, including in complex perturbations where many TFs respond. TFEA- LE is especially effective in technically challenging datasets, whether due to highly specific or broad responses, outliers, or high GC content.

To address this question, we modeled a CA3-CA1 network to compare the learning dynamics and synaptic stability of AcD and nonAcD cells. The results revealed that, during learning, these cell types employ distinct mechanisms. AcD cells primarily adopt a single-modal strategy, with all dendritic branches converging to encode inputs from a single assembly, whereas nonAcD cells follow a multi-modal approach, with individual branches encoding inputs from distinct assemblies. Additionally, consistent with experimental findings, our results suggest that during periods of high inhibition (such as ripples), AcD cells maintain stable synaptic weights, unlike the synaptic decay observed in nonAcD cells.

We replicated a localized, load-dependent increase in univariate BOLD activity in parietal cortex.

Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants' ability to update their predictions in behavior.

A.; Tung, V. W. K.; Reader-Harris, E.; Murray, A.

Vestibular sensory neurons provide the nervous system with information about head rotation and acceleration. However, the nervous system can also modify the activity of sensory neurons and hair cells via the actions of the efferent vestibular system (EVS). The function of the EVS has remained unknown partly because of an inability to target efferent vestibular neurons in a selective manner to understand their synaptic inputs and function during behaviour. Here, we present a novel method for the selective targeting and expression of flp-recombinase in EVS neurons. We take advantage of the dual expression of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in these neurons to develop an adeno-associate virus (AAV) that expresses a gene only in neurons with this intersectional expression. We use this system to map the monosynaptic inputs to EVS neurons and show inputs from distinct populations of brainstem and midbrain regions indicating a functional role as a multimodal processing center and integrator for the vestibular periphery. To demonstrate the applicability of our technology in behavioural assays, we performed a preliminary behaviour analysis in mice with disrupted EVS function. While more bespoke assays are required to ascertain EVS function/s, our viral method presents a novel tool for investigators examining the role of the vestibular system and its central circuits.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

The specific influence of finer morphological details, such as diameter and length of dendritic branches, on response variability is yet unclear. In this study, we address this question using a model database approach with spatially extended, conductance-based compartmental models to study variability of response features, such as resting membrane potential, input resistance, spike count, first spike latency, spike height, and spike width. Using 15 reconstructed morphologies of leech touch cells with fixed branching patterns, we identified several thousands of parameter sets that reproduced the experimentally measured response features of all the tested morphologies. Even when the biophysical parameters were kept equal across reconstructed morphologies, variability in response features arose from the morphological details. Systematically varying the distribution of ion channels across the neuronal membrane revealed that all spike response features are influenced by the location of spike initiation zones with higher conductance density. Nevertheless, biologically plausible responses can arise from different locations of spike initiation zones and even homogeneous distribution of ion channels. Furthermore, comparing the simulated spike responses from two morphological subtypes of leech touch cells revealed that the previously published systematic differences cannot be explained by the morphological differences alone. A larger total conductance was required to reproduce the experimental finding of an increased spike count and a larger spike amplitude in a morphological subtype with a larger membrane area. In conclusion, biophysical properties, morphological details, and ion channel distribution across the membrane all interact in their contribution to the functionality and response variability of neurons of the same cell type.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

M.; Wright, K. K.; Rice, P. J.; Pasquerau, B.; Turner, R. S.", "abstract": "How the brain organizes discrete actions into fluid sequences is a central problem in motor neuroscience. Competing models of basal ganglia (BG) function propose that BG neurons either signal sequence boundaries or encode movements across ordinal positions. Prior studies have largely examined fixed sequences with end-of-sequence rewards, leaving open whether such findings generalize to more naturalistic conditions. We trained four rhesus macaques to perform a visuomotor sequence task requiring four or five out-and-back joystick movements to peripheral targets. Sequences were completed under two conditions: a random condition, in which target order varied across trials, and a fixed condition, in which order was predictable and consistent. Rewards were delivered after each movement, dissociating reward timing from sequence completion. We recorded single-unit activity in arm-related regions of the globus pallidus (GP; n = 458) and primary motor cortex (M1; n = 306). Regression analyses revealed that many neurons in both GP and M1 encoded ordinal position within a sequence. Order effects were more frequent in the fixed condition, but were also present during random sequences. We found no evidence for preferential encoding of sequence initiation or termination in overlearned sequences, in contrast to prior studies reporting start/stop signals in basal ganglia. Weak effects appeared under the random condition in one animal pair, but these did not generalize across animals or conditions. Instead, neurons exhibited heterogeneous order-related responses spanning the full sequence. These results demonstrate that GP neurons, like those in M1, encode ordinal position throughout a sequence rather than acting solely as sequence initiators or terminators. This challenges boundary-specific models of BG function and highlights a broader role for the BG in representing serial order during motor sequence production.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Repetitive sensory stimulation, such as rhythmic whisker stimulation (RWS) at behaviourally relevant frequencies (8 Hz), can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses in typically developing mice. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading monogenically inherited form of intellectual disability, is associated with altered tactile reactivity, where non-noxious touch can be aversive. To investigate how sensory-evoked plasticity is altered in FXS, we combined ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the Somatosensory (S1) cortex of adult male Fragile X mouse model (Fmr1-/y) mice and typically developing (Fmr1+/y) control littermates. We found that plasticity induced by repetitive sensory stimulation was impaired in Fmr1-/y mice ex and in vivo compared to controls. L4-evoked subthreshold synaptic responses were hyperexcitable in L2/3 PNs, consistent with circuit-level disinhibition. Despite this, baseline intrinsic spiking evoked by current steps remained largely unchanged and whisker-evoked activity appeared diminished in vivo. We observed a shortening of the axon initial segment (AIS) in L2/3 in Fmr1-/y compared to control mice, which may reveal a potential mechanism to explain why subthreshold hyperexcitability did not induce more spiking. We also observed an increase in adaptation to the repetitive stimulation in Fmr1-/y mice compared to controls, which may underlie failure to induce plasticity. Together, these findings suggest that L2/3 PNs of S1 in Fmr1-/y mice are locked in a hypoplastic state, potentially related to disrupted inhibitory control, AIS shortening, and rapid adaptation during repetitive sensory stimulation. As somatosensory processes underly tactile perception, these findings may potentially underly altered tactile reactivity in FXS.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

One of the reasons for this is the exclusion of rare variants, despite growing evidence of their substantial contribution to genetic liability. Here we implemented the Independent Outlier Gene Count (IOGC) - a score summarising the individual burden of rare variants associated with outlying gene expression - and measured the amount of liability explained by this rare-variant score, alone and in combination with common-variant PRS, for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the UK Biobank. IOGC and PRS were minimally correlated (|r|<0.2), indicating the two scores capture complementary information. For schizophrenia, a model including both IOGC and PRS explained 1.13 times the adjusted liability than PRS alone. For hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a 1.48-fold increase was observed for the combined model. People with high IOGC showed a 64% and 46% higher positive predictive value for schizophrenia and HCM, respectively, as compared to those with low IOGC. No improvement was observed for depression.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a systemic disorder of the connective tissue caused by heterozygous mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin 1, a glycoprotein that constitutes elastic fibers. MFS does not exhibit sexual dimorphism regarding prevalence; however, it remains unknown whether the paternal or maternal inheritance of the FBN1 mutation affects the cardiovascular pathology of the offspring. In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of the parental origin of the FBN1 mutation on the cardiovascular manifestations of the offspring using the Fbn1C1041G/+ mouse model of MFS. Methods and Results. Four experimental groups were generated by crossing wild-type (WT) and MFS mice to obtain WT and MFS offspring from either a paternal (MFS-P) or maternal (MFS-M) MFS parent. Cardiovascular phenotyping of offspring was performed from childhood to adulthood (from one to six months of age), including echocardiography, tail-cuff plethysmography, histopathology, and canonical (pSmad2) and non-canonical (pERK) TGF-{beta} signaling activity in the aortic tissue. At one month of age, both WT and MFS offspring from MFS-M presented lower body weight than those from MFS-P. However, with age, MFS-M offspring became persistently and significantly overweight. Both MFS-P and MFS-M offspring exhibited a significantly increased aortic root diameter compared with WT offspring; however, this enlargement appeared earlier in MFS-M than in MFS-P offspring. These parental and age-related differences in aortic root diameter were accompanied by increased canonical and non-canonical TGF-{beta} signaling. The cardiac ejection fraction was reduced at early ages in both WT and MFS offspring from MFS-M compared with MFS-P, with the difference persisting only in MFS-M offspring at adulthood. Systolic blood pressure was initially lower in MFS-M offspring across both genotypes. However, it progressively increased, resulting in elevated levels in both WT and MFS offspring from MFS-M by six months of age.

SQTS3 is caused by gain-of-function mutations in KCNJ2, which codes the strong inward rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 responsible for the repolarizing current IK1. Inward-going rectification of IK1 is due to a voltage-dependent block by intracellular magnesium and polyamines. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of extrinsic polyamine administration to restore normal cardiac repolarization and prevent life-threatening arrhythmias in an AAV9-mediated mouse model of SQTS3 carrying the Kir2.1M301K mutation, which shortens the QT interval to a minimum of 194ms in patients. Compared to Kir2.1WT, the QT interval was significantly shortened in Kir2.1M301K mice. Intracardiac stimulation induced long-lasting, high-frequency ventricular tachycardia. Patch-clamping demonstrated an extremely abbreviated action potential duration (APD) in Kir2.1M301K cardiomyocytes due to a Kir2.1 lack of inward rectification. These IK1 defects decreased INa density and NaV1.5 expression. The mechanistically targeted Kir2.1 blockage by exogenous polyamines (spermine intraperitoneally or spermidine orally) prolonged the APD and the QT interval, and significantly reduced arrhythmia inducibility in Kir2.1M301K mice. Polyamines significantly reduced the IK1 gain-of-function, an effect that alleviated the INa reduction in mutant cardiomyocytes. Therefore, repurposing polyamine administration might be a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for managing cardiac arrhythmias in SQTS3 patients.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We show that FOXA1 can bind the EF1 promoter, which is widely used in industry. Overexpressing FOXA1 in an industrially-relevant CHO-DG44 cell line raised production of monoclonal antibody encoded by transgenes transcribed from EF1 promoters. Mechanistically, this response can be attributed to recruitment by FOXA1 of epigenetic modifiers and a chromatin remodelling complex, which reprogramme the promoter to optimise transcription.

To date, surgical intervention is the only option for managing large AAAs, with no pharmacological therapies to prevent growth of small aneurysms. A current limitation in investigating further pharmacological avenues is the translatability of results from animal models, or from patient trials that are limited by co-morbidities and disease severity. To bridge this knowledge gap, we created a novel, patient-specific vessel-on-chip (VoC) model of the microcirculation in AAA (AAA-VoC). Approach and Results: We found that co-culture of both C (control)-VSMCs and AAA-patient derived VSMCs with healthy, hiPSC-derived ECs generate lumenized and perfusable microvascular networks. We show that AAA-VoCs are characterized by an enlarged average vascular diameter. We furthermore found that AAA-VSMCs show phenotypical deviations from C-VSMCs after 7 days in co-culture such as increased number and surface area, indicative of a preserved pathological phenotype in our in vitro model. Lastly, we demonstrate that AAA-VoCs showed an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression over C-VoCs and displayed an impaired endothelial barrier function, resulting in vascular leakage.

Because TNR instability causes mutagenesis of the underlying gene, we refer to the repeat instability phenomenon as TNR mutagenesis in this study. While germline expansions destabilize TNR to cause disease anticipation, somatic cell TNR instability drives earlier onset of symptoms and further disease progression. However, the drivers behind these repeat length changes remain unclear. Current models suggest that DNA replication slippage events and the action of genome instability pathways, such as DNA repair, cause TNR mutagenesis. Whether mutagenic polymerases from the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway result in TNR instability is unclear. TLS polymerases are best at bypassing difficult-to-replicate DNA regions due to bulky lesions or gaps in DNA. While some effects of TLS polymerases on TNR instability have been explored in lower organisms, evidence in human cells is lacking. Using a quantitative GFP reporter with expanded CAG repeats, we show that inhibition of the TLS polymerase REV1 by its inhibitor, JH-RE-06, or siRNA knockdown increases TNR instability and the underlying mutability. These results suggest that REV1 protects Trinucleotide repeat length mutagenesis through potential continuous DNA synthesis when replicative polymerases stall ahead of repeat secondary structures. Collectively, we present evidence of the role of the TLS pathway in TNR instability, with potential implications for understanding mutability mechanisms, disease biology, and therapeutic targeting.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Spodoptera frugiperda is a major invasive insect pest species consisting of two strains with different host-plant ranges. In this paper, we characterized proteins and genomic regions involved in their biogenesis as well as TE and gene transcripts regulated by piRNAs. By phylogenetic analysis, we identified two new Piwi genes conserved in the genus Spodoptera, compared to the Lepidopteran model Bombyx mori, one more than in Drosophila. One of them, more expressed in gonads then soma could be a functional homolog of Drosophila PIWI or replace AGO3. A pool of 11 sRNA-Seq libraries was used to annotate piRNA clusters with Shortstack in the genomes of the two strains of Spodoptera frugiperda. Identification of TE targeted by piRNAs revealed that active transposons differ between the two strains of S. frugiperda despite of a similar TE content, as putative cause or consequence of reproductive isolation. GO analysis of genes targeted by piRNAs shows that some are involved in protein translation initiation. A piRNA cluster in the Masc gene suggests that sex determination is regulated by piRNAs in Spodoptera frugiperda. Our analysis supports that piRNAs have additional roles than silencing of transposable elements and contributes to functional annotation of the two strains genomes of Spodoptera frugiperda.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Unlike nucleus, mitochondria exist in multiple copies, with many copies of mitochondrial DNA. A metabolically active cell possess about 103 and 104 copies of the mitochondrial genome. Lowered mtDNA copy number leads to disorders or disease, in a similar way as mutation in mtDNA causes a wide range of disease or disorders. In this current article, we estimated mtDNA copy number through QPCR analysis of cytochrome B gene and revealed that healthy individuals have better mtDNA copy number compared to that of the infected ones under natural challenge in sheep model against the parasite Haemonchus contortus infection. We diagnosed the infected animals for H. contortus primarily with symptoms, followed by Faecal egg count and final confirmation through molecular diagnosis. We had characterized the cytochrome B gene from abomasum(stomach) of sheep, which is the site of predilection of this parasite. In our lab, earlier we have documented certain immune response nuclear genes to have antiparasitic role. We had reported the mutations in cytochrome B leading to debility and disease in sheep. Quantitative expression profile for cytochrome B is an indication of the copy number of mitochondrial genes and we observed significantly better expression profile of cytochrome B in healthy sheep in comparison to infected one.

Results: We apply two ASN prediction methods with 30 matched parameter sets to generate candidate ASNs for five breast and ovarian cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find that: 1) junction 9-mer peptides generated by two similarly designed pipelines differed by, on average, 68.9% and 76.6% in the BRCA and OV cohorts, respectively, and putatively cancer-specific junction 9-mers from the two pipelines diverged further, by an average of 81.5 % in OV and 84.6 % in BRCA; 2) the most lenient filters in the BRCA cohort show the highest divergence, at 97 %; 3) the rate of mass spectrometry validation of ASNs' protein presence in cells is dominated by the size of the input space; and 4) putatively cancer-specific ASNs found by the intersection of both pipelines can be validated when accounting for false discovery with an average of 1.74 and 284.4 candidates in the BRCA and OV cohorts, respectively.

B-ALL is a malignant disease displaying considerable phenotypical and functional heterogeneity, yet the underlying cellular organization remains largely elusive. This study aims to investigate the hierarchical landscape of B-ALL by combining barcoding and multiome single cell data to unveil the differentiation architecture and temporal dynamics of leukemic differentiation at clonal and single cell resolution in vivo. Single-cell transcriptome and AbSeq analysis of lentiviral barcoded and transplanted patient-derived B-ALL cells revealed interconnected subpopulations, which could be prospectively isolated via surface markers and exhibited distinct leukemogenicity. Barcode tracking demonstrated the ability of cells to differentiate from a source cluster into differentiated progeny. Using machine learning we identified expression patterns predicting their differentiation potential of each barcoded cell within the immature cell compartment. To determine the dynamical properties of clones, we have designed a mathematical model that simulates the development of these subpopulations from a clonally diverse stem cell compartment. The model confirmed the most likely cluster of origin, supporting our functional data, and revealed the variability in dynamical properties between clones, while largely excluding plasticity. Hence, our work demonstrates a unidirectional differentiation in B-ALL with an immature population exhibiting a high leukemogenic potential.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

This situation led us to interrogate the potential role in the development of chemoresistance of ZEB1, an EMT-inducing transcription factor (EMT-TF) that we previously identified as a pro tumorigenic factor in tumour cells and CAF of iCCA. By analysing human CCA samples and sc-RNAseq public databases, we show here that ZEB1 is present in the tumour microenvironment of all iCCA patients tested and is prominently expressed by CAF. Using cellular models of CAF, we show that cells depleted for ZEB1 are more sensitive to gemcitabine and cisplatin, via a mechanism involving the regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2. Moreover, ZEB1 expressing CAF protect iCCA tumour cells against the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs, an event that could be reversed by a BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Therefore, our results point to the use of BCL2 inhibitors to improve the efficacy of current chemotherapeutic regimens of gemcitabine and cisplatin in iCCA patients.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Although remodeling and inherent vulnerability of the aortic media, as observed in heritable connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome, have been implicated in the onset of AD, the precise pathological mechanisms underlying the non-heritable form, which accounts for most cases, remains largely unknown2. Here, using hyperacute AD patient-derived samples, we show that pathological angiogenesis within the aortic media precedes the onset of dissection. Integrating single-cell transcriptomic analysis of aortic medial endothelial cells with high-resolution imaging revealed temporal changes preceding dissection. Hypoxic alterations in the media triggered osteochondrogenic changes in smooth muscle cells, promoted hydroxyapatite deposition, and induced angiogenesis via VEGF secretion from AD-specific CD14+CD68+CD163+MRC1(CD206)neg-low macrophages. Atomic force microscopy revealed that these processes culminated in the formation of a soft capillary layer, potentially concentrating stress on this region and contributing to AD onset. H&E staining of archived specimens revealed that non-heritable AD can be classified into angiogenic or non-angiogenic subtypes, with more than half exhibiting the former. In contrast, acute AD cases associated with Marfan syndrome typically exhibit a non-angiogenic pattern, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. This study reports angiogenesis as a key pathological driver in non-heritable AD and highlight potential targets for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

One of the most consistent differences across animals is that females store more body fat than males, a metabolic trait conserved from flies to humans. Given the central role of gut hormones in energy balance, we asked whether gut endocrine signaling underlies these sex differences. We therefore performed a multidimensional screen of enteroendocrine cell (EEC)-derived signaling across a broad panel of metabolic and behavioral traits in male and female Drosophila. This screen uncovered extensive sex-biased roles for EEC-derived signals - many of which are conserved in mammals - in energy storage, stress resistance, feeding, and sleep. We found that EEC-derived amidated peptide hormones sustain female-typical states, including elevated fat reserves, enhanced stress resilience, and protein-biased food choice. In contrast, the non-amidated peptide Allatostatin C (AstC) promoted male-like traits by stimulating energy mobilization, thereby antagonizing amidated-peptide function. Female guts contained more AstC-positive EECs. Disruption of peptide amidation by eliminating peptidylglycine -hydroxylating monooxygenase - the enzyme required for maturation of most gut peptide hormones - abolished female-typical physiology and behavior, shifting females toward a male-like state. Among individual amidated peptides, Diuretic hormone 31 (DH31) and Neuropeptide F (NPF) emerged as key mediators of female physiology.

The double KO mutation is phenotypically similar to the Arp2/3 mutation, and the effect of RIC4 loss is completely eliminated. Analysis of overexpression revealed that excess RIC4 significantly suppresses the formation of pavement cell lobes. However, RIC4 does not require an active Arp2/3 complex for this effect. Our data further show that overexpression of RIC4 has a specific actin stabilization effect in cotyledon epidermal cells. However, we could not demonstrate that actin stabilization is directly related to the cell shape changes that RIC4 overexpression induces.

However, assessing model functionality solely by its ability to produce biomass is reductive; the predicted growth must also be biologically consistent. The definition and integration of this artificial reaction should theoretically reflect the organism-specific macromolecular composition and stoichiometry under defined environmental conditions. In practice, however, reconstruction decisions -- whether documented, reasoned, or arbitrary -- often lead to model refinements aimed at ensuring functionality, which can potentially introduce biases. Such accommodations, along with limited transparency in model development, may compromise the reliability of simulation outcomes. To mitigate this issue, we advocate for the systematic implementation of rapid and simple sensitivity analyses during the final stages of GSMN reconstruction. This approach enables the evaluation of model robustness and the predictive reliability of flux distributions with respect to the biomass reaction formulation. To illustrate this framework, we apply two sensitivity tests to the iPrub22 GSMN of the filamentous fungus Penicillium rubens, an organism known for its capacity to produce a broad range of high-value natural products. The first test evaluates sensitivity to the quantitative definition of the biomass reaction, and the second examines model behaviour under alternative nutrient conditions. Adopting this approach enables a quantitative assessment of the degree of independence exhibited by a model's flux productions with respect to the composition of biomass reactions.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Adolescent stress has been linked to enhanced risk for OUD in humans, however attempts to model this preclinically have yielded mixed results. Additionally, few studies have explored whether adolescent stress modulates the reinforcing effects of prescription opioids. Here we investigate the impact of acute adolescent stress on oxycodone self-administration in male and female rats. Methods: Adolescent male and female rats underwent acute restraint stress during concurrent exposure to predator odor, or control handling. Approximately one week later, subjects were allowed to acquire IV oxycodone self-administration (0.03 mg/kg/inf) over 10 sessions (2 h/day) under a fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement. Following three additional FR1 sessions and seven sessions under FR3, rats underwent two progressive-ratio tests (0.03 mg/kg/inf and 0.06 mg/kg/inf, respectively). Separate groups of adolescent rats underwent similar experimental manipulations but were trained on sucrose reinforcement. Results: Adolescent stress did not affect the rate of acquisition of IV oxycodone self-administration. However, oxycodone self-administration escalated during post-acquisition FR1 sessions and remained elevated during FR3 sessions in stressed rats as compared to unstressed controls. Adolescent stress exposure did not affect responding during progressive-ratio tests, nor did it affect any measure of sucrose pellet reinforcement. Conclusions: The present results are the first to demonstrate adolescent stress-induced enhancement of oxycodone reinforcement in rats and provide a preclinical model for investigating the neurobiological mechanisms by which adolescent stress increases vulnerability for prescription opioid misuse.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

This underscores the need to better understand the heterogeneity of ACh neurons, particularly the sub-population of ACh neurons co-expressing GABAergic markers. We used various combinations of transgenic mouse lines to systematically label ACh neuron populations positive for different GABAergic markers in the brain. We developed a workflow combining tissue clearing, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, and machine learning to image entire mouse brain hemispheres followed by quantification of ACh neurons throughout the brain. With this approach, we assessed the role of GABA co-transmission in ACh neuron function and quantified ACh and ACh/GABA neuron sub-populations in the brain. Our results suggest that GABA co-transmission from ACh neurons is not required to maintain the regular ACh neuron count in the brain. Furthermore, we report that a large subset of ACh neurons can potentially synthesize GABA by co-expressing the marker Gad2. However, most of these ACh neurons do not express vGAT, which would enable these neurons to release GABA.

We studied the allergenic properties of SplB in a mouse model of chronic allergic airway inflammation (AAI). We induced AAI by repeated intratracheal inoculations of recombinant SplB in C57BL/6J mice, wild-type, Rag2 ko, IL-33 ko, and PAR2 ko. We also exposed wild type mice to an enzymatically inactive mutant of SplB. Airway inflammation was assessed by flow cytometry and airway hyperreactivity measurements. The specific antibody response was characterized by ELISA. We observed severe eosinophil inflammation in the airways and lungs of SplB-sensitized mice, as well as airway hypersensitivity and high SplB-specific serum IgE titers. Remarkably, SplB induced this asthma phenotype without the need for adjuvants. Characterization of the pathomechanisms revealed that the proteolytic activity of SplB and a functional adaptive immune system were essential for the development of murine asthma. The soluble protease sensor IL-33 was necessary for eosinophil tissue invasion, whereas the membrane-bound protease sensor PAR2 was dispensable.

This function resulted from a direct interaction between SIRP and CD18 ({beta}2 integrin) in cis at the surface of macrophages, involving SIRP amino acids distinct from those implicated in theSIRP-CD47 interaction. The cis interaction prevented activation of CD18, which is necessary for phagocytosis. Combined blockade of SIRP-CD18 and SIRP-CD47 was essential for maximizing phagocytosis and suppression of tumor growth in vivo. Similar cis interactions between CD18 and other inhibitory checkpoints, including PD-1, were also observed.

Otolith microstructure was examined to characterize both population-level and intra-population growth (OPT-optimal and DEF-deficient group), with special emphasis on the flexion process, as well as to provide insights into larval survival. SBT larvae began flexion at sizes and ages comparable to those reported in other bluefin tuna species. At the intra-population level, larvae reached flexion at the same age; however, optimal (OPT) larvae reached this stage in better physical condition, with greater length, weight, and body depth, likely increasing their chances of survival at later stages. The observed larval growth rates (0.38 mm/d) exceeded those from a historical study in 1987 (0.33 mm/d), likely due to a ~2 C increase in sea surface temperature and shifts in prey availability. Larval survival appears to depend on a selective process based on growth, in which only a small proportion of individuals (<2%) exhibited width increment in otoliths similar to those of surviving larvae, allowing for faster development and earlier access to larger prey.

These stages, often dismissed as inert and unaffected by environmental changes, remain a black box in ecological research despite their key role in parasites' life cycle. Here, we examined how heatwaves affect the infectivity and progression of infection of Pasteuria ramosa, a bacterial parasite of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. In order to measure the respective influences of the bacterial genotype and the heatwaves, we exposed the off-host stages (=spores) from four genetically distinct parasite clones to three temperature regimes (20C, 30C, 40C), and tested their subsequent effects on host and parasite traits. Heatwaves reduced parasite infectivity, regardless of parasite genotype. Intriguingly, heat-stressed spores induced genotype-specific shifts in their host: one host clone increased castration rates at higher temperatures, while others experienced moderate to dramatic declines. Furthermore, individuals exposed to heat-stressed spores that remained uninfected, exhibited enhanced survival, suggesting reduced costs of resistance against damaged parasite spores. This study provides insights into how heatwaves, endured only by the parasite, can modulate various aspects of host-parasite interactions, underlying the importance of the parasite's environmental history in evolutionary ecology and epidemiology.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

P.; Varghese, J. M.; S, A.; Pant, N.; Saha, S.", "abstract": "The glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus plays a central role in the viral entry into host cells. The detailed study of Ebola glycoprotein in the cellular system is unknown, mainly due to the resolution limit (~{lambda}/2) of optical fluorescence microscopes. To overcome this, we propose to use single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), which enables the study of the role of glycoproteins at both the single-molecule and ensemble levels. Accordingly, a photoactivable recombinant probe Dendra2-EboVGlyc is developed by linking Ebola glycoprotein with Dendra2. The transient expression of photoactivable recombinant protein in NIH3T3 cells indicated the dominant presence of glycoprotein in the plasma membrane with regions of densely packed glycoproteins. Super-resolution single-molecule imaging gives direct proof of glycoprotein clusters in the plasma membrane. The corresponding single-molecule analysis using DBSCAN clustering algorithm reveals a dense packing of glycoprotein with an estimated average density of 5345 mol/m2 compared to the density in other regions of the membrane. The number of glycoproteins is estimated to be as high as 642 molecules per cluster and clusters spread area of {approx} 0.1219 m2 after 48 hrs post-transfection. Noting that glycoprotein is involved in cellular attachment, endosomal entry, and membrane fusion, the formation of glycoprotein clusters in the membrane is significant in the progression of Ebola pathogenesis. A drug capable of dispersing the glycoproteins clusters could be of therapeutic potential to lessen the intensity of infection and to slow down the disease progression.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

The dynamic nature of IDPs and the lack of well-defined binding sites make drug discovery and development both challenging. Although computational protocols, predominantly involving molecular dynamics (MD) simulations studies, have been complementing in understanding the structure and dynamics of IDPs, the choice of force fields become important in reproducing experimental observations. We herewith provide a systematic study to investigate the structural propensity of four IDPs (A{beta}42, Tau43, amylin and S), using 13 combinations of force field-water models (FF-wm). In addition to validating with NMR observables, we also examine the water dynamics surrounding the chosen IDPs to underscore the generalizability of chosen FF-wms.

Sets with compounds with available and undisclosed estimates were selected (n=140). The risk that test compounds have been used in training sets for model building (and thereby, influenced and exaggerated the predictive performances) was minimized. At least, these were not included in training sets for ANDROMEDA. One set consisted of compounds that have not been marketed and for which pharmacokinetic information has not been publically disclosed. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations and comparisons were done. For both fa and fu, ANDROMEDA was clearly more accurate and balanced than the others, with higher Q2 (0.69 vs 0.35 for fa; 0.94 vs 0.62-0.76 for fu), lower mean errors (15 % vs 28 %; 2.3- vs 4.1- to 36-fold), lower maximum errors (54 % vs 92 %; 10- vs 30- to 524-fold), more correct predicted classes (70-77 % vs 13-54 %), no failed, inconclusive or poor predictions (as found for 3 of the other software), wider application range, and minimal skewness at low values. It had intercepts on fa- and fu-prediction axes that were ca 1/3 and 1/175 to 1/23 compared to those found for the other software, which is of particular importance. Two software, PkCSM and Swiss ADME, were considered inappropriate, whereas ADMETlab took an intermediate performance position. Apparently, DruMAP was second best performing software. Overall, there was poor performance overlap between the software (7-24 %), with many contradictory predictions. Advantages with ANDROMEDA suggest that this is the software of choice for those that desire adequate predictions of fa and fu in humans and estimates of certainty.

In Arabidopsis, the stationary phloem-associated SIEVE ELEMENT-LINING CHAPERONE1 (SLI1) and RESTRICTED TEV MOVEMENT (RTM) proteins restrict insect phloem-feeding and potyviruses systemic transport, respectively. However, their broader roles in plant-attacker interactions remain largely unexplored. We investigated the roles of SLI1, RTM1, RTM2, and RTM3 in tobacco etch virus (TEV) infection, as well as in Myzus persicae and Heterodera schachtii infestations using Arabidopsis mutants. Systemic TEV movement was quantified, aphid behaviour and reproduction were assessed, and cyst nematode infection was monitored. SLI1 did not restrict TEV systemic movement, RTM3 reduced M. persicae reproduction without altering feeding behaviour, SLI1, RTM2, and RTM3 supported H. schachtii infection and feeding site expansion, and confocal images indicated a possible role of the proteins in de novo synthesis of sieve tubes around syncytia. These findings reveal that stationary phloem proteins exert dual and target-specific effects, limiting some attackers while inadvertently facilitating others.

Profiling secondary structures in vivo and in real-time remains challenging because RNAs exhibit dynamic structures and complex conformations. Besides the stem-loop canonical secondary structure, the non-canonical structure RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) is of great interest for its potential as a drug target. Early studies have demonstrated that RNAs can form distinct secondary structures. However, it is not well understood how distinct RNA structures, formed from the same RNA sequences, function within the transcriptome. The factors driving and regulating structure transitions remain poorly investigated. Inspired by a segment in the HOXB9 mRNA capable of forming multiple structures, we found that many RNA segments across the transcriptome exhibit multi-faceted structure-forming potential. For the HOXB9 case, we demonstrated that RNA modification influences RNA structure and binding with RNA binding proteins. Therefore, we collected RNA modification sites naturally occurring in the putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences (PQSs) of transcripts and developed MoRNiNG, a freely accessible database at https://www.cityu.edu.hk/bms/morning. The database is designed and organized by reliability tiers determined by the resolution of RNA modification sites and capable of including various large datasets. We experimentally validated the influence of m6A, m5C, and A-to-I editing on rG4-forming sequences and provided evidence to support the modification switch concept.

This time-dependent facilitation manifests through dual neural mechanisms: Robust CAR broadly amplifies dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) engagement during suppression attempts and specifically strengthens top-down dlPFC control over hippocampal-striatal circuits exclusively for recent traces.

However, the large volume of vEM datasets poses a challenge in the segmentation, classification, and spatial analysis of tens of thousands of vesicles and their target cell in 3D.

Our package integrates the efficiency of deep learning and the accuracy of human proofreading and provides a streamlined package in chunked processing and accurate indexing, localization, and visualization of single vesicle resolution in large vEM data. We demonstrate the viability of VesiclePy using high-pressure frozen serial EM data of Hydra vulgaris and quantify the performance of the package using ground truth manual annotations. We show that VesiclePy can process a multiterabyte serial EM dataset, efficiently annotate 53,851 vesicles from 20 complete neurons, and classify vesicles into 5 types.

C.", "abstract": "Aim: Green turtles are a widely distributed and highly migratory species, despite extensive data on the movement of green turtles, there is no global synthesis on the subject, limiting a holistic understanding of their movement. Based on three decades of published literature, we present the first global model of migratory connectivity for green turtles. Location: Global. Time Period: 1990-2022. Major Taxa Studied: Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas). Methods: We conducted a structured literature review extracting georeferenced information on the movement of green turtles from 1990 to 2022, aggregating this information into a single connectivity model, defining sites and 'metasites' as nodes of connectivity. We then evaluate the connectivity routes from nesting areas to foraging sites for each RMU, identifying those trajectories moving outside and across the boundaries of these areas. Results: We found an increasing number of studies assessing movement of green turtles, with a total of 113 sources of migratory connectivity information. We identified 474 sites, representing locations where green turtles were observed (124 of these being nesting sites). Migratory connections from nesting sites ranged from resident turtles never leaving the area, to rookeries linked to 13 different sites, some over 5,000 km apart. This long-distance connectivity exposes populations to threats across disparate locations. Most connections traversed national jurisdictions, including crossing different Regional Management Units. Main Conclusions: We compiled the largest available dataset describing movement of green turtles worldwide and present the first global model of their migratory connectivity. This model provides ecological insights into regional differences in life histories, identifies geographic and demographic gaps in sampling, and provides baseline information on connectivity to support transboundary management of green turtle populations. The study highlights the need for larger collaborative efforts to aggregate knowledge beyond local jurisdictions, to inform and align effective management measures to protect this threatened species.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Unlike most secreted proteins, FGF2 lacks a signal peptide and is exported by an unconventional secretory pathway, bypassing the ER/Golgi system. A key event of this unusual secretory mechanism is FGF2 recruitment at the inner plasma membrane leaflet mediated by the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2. This interaction induces FGF2 oligomerization, which, in turn, triggers the formation of a transient lipidic membrane pore with a toroidal structure. FGF2 oligomers populating such membrane pores are captured and disassembled at the outer plasma membrane leaflet through interactions with heparan sulfate chains of the cell surface proteoglycan GPC1, resulting in full translocation of FGF2 across the plasma membrane. Once FGF2 appears on cell surfaces, it engages in signaling complexes initiating autocrine or paracrine signaling. Here, using a multidisciplinary and multiscale approach, we show that FGF2 self-assembles into oligomers that induce lateral PI(4,5)P2 partitioning and membrane remodeling. This process depends on PI(4,5)P2 reaching a critical local threshold concentration that, due to its non-bilayer properties destabilizes the bilayer, facilitating pore formation and FGF2 translocation across the plasma membrane. Our findings highlight a fundamental principle of how protein oligomerization can induce lateral partitioning of membrane lipids that in turn leads to a drastic membrane remodeling event: the transformation of the lipid bilayer into a toroidal membrane pore. The underlying mechanism is likely to be applicable to a wide range of membrane lipid interacting proteins that induce membrane remodeling in other cellular processes.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

RhoV, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, has been implicated in tumor development in other cancer types, such as breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. However, its role in PDAC remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression and functional impact of RhoV on PDAC. Analysis of publicly available datasets and immunohistochemical profiling of 114 PDAC patient specimens were used to evaluate the expression of RhoV in PDAC and its prognostic impact. Overexpression and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of RhoV were established in three pancreatic cancer cell lines. Functional analyses, such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, colony formation, spheroid growth, and mouse xenograft, were used to evaluate the role of RhoV in PDAC cells. RhoV overexpression was associated with reduced overall and recurrence-free survival in public datasets and our own patient cohort. Functional assays demonstrated that RhoV overexpression promoted PDAC cell proliferation, colony formation, and spheroid growth, whereas knockout of RhoV suppressed these changes. Moreover, RhoV enhanced PDAC cell migration and invasion in vitro, accompanied by downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of N-cadherin and vimentin, indicating induction of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, RhoV overexpression activated key MAPK pathway components, including phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38. In vivo, xenograft models confirmed that RhoV drives tumor growth and increases tumor burden. These results establish RhoV as a novel oncogenic factor in PDAC progression and highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target, warranting further investigation into combinatorial targeting strategies to overcome KRAS inhibitor resistance.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

CDK4/6 inhibitors such as palbociclib have only been tested as second-line agents in eSCC, often in combination with EGFR inhibitors, with minimal benefit. Our study evaluates palbociclib as a first-line therapy in treatment-naive eSCC models. Using a panel of 22 eSCC cell lines with integrated multi-omics and phenotypic assays, we identified three response subtypes, resistant, delayed and arrested, correlated to Rb-pathway status. Interestingly, in delayed responders, palbociclib induced replication stress, DNA damage, and unprotected micronuclei enriched for cGAS, triggering activation of interferon-stimulated genes. Consistent with this, palbociclib enhanced immune cell infiltration in delayed eSCC spheroids within a preclinical vascularized 3D microfluidic system. Our study demonstrates that first-line palbociclib treatment unmasks intrinsic vulnerabilities in the CDK4/6-Rb axis and triggers innate immune activation in molecularly defined eSCC. Using a translationally relevant 3D vascularized microfluidic system, we provide evidence that early CDK4/6 inhibition not only stall cancer cell growth but also promotes immune cells recruitment.

However, contextual differences might hamper generalization of these findings towards overground walking, and ultimately daily life gait. This study investigated whether foot placement control manifests itself differently during overground as compared to treadmill walking in healthy young adults. 14 young adults walked at comfortable walking speed, both on the treadmill and overground in a figure-8 path. During overground walking we found a significant relationship between the step width/step length and the center-of-mass state during the swing phase of walking, capturing foot placement control with the same linear model as during treadmill walking. Contrary to what was hypothesized, we found a significant lower foot placement precision during overground walking for the step width model with center-of-mass state at the start of the swing phase as predictor, complemented by a wider average step width. Moreover, during overground walking participants responded less strongly to a deviation in center-of-mass position, yet significantly stronger to deviations in center-of-mass velocity at the end of the step for both the step width/step length models. Exploratory analysis showed a larger relative contribution of velocity feedback during over ground walking as compared to treadmill walking. These differences warrant caution in generalizing foot placement findings during treadmill walking to overground walking and might be promising for the estimation of foot placement control in daily life gait.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

D.; Lankarany, M.", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) has been a standard therapy for essential tremor. It has been shown that high frequency ([&ge;]100Hz) DBS suppresses Vim neuronal firing and tremor activity, however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we use in vivo recordings (single-unit) of Vim neurons (n=19, people with essential tremor) during different DBS frequencies to investigate whether neuronal suppression during high-frequency DBS occurs at synaptic/cellular levels (e.g., cell inhibition due to synaptic depression/fatigue during high-frequency DBS) or is influenced by network-level effects (e.g., recurrent inhibition). We propose a theoretical framework that explains DBS effects at both cellular and network levels, i.e., (continuous) high-frequency DBS not only depresses synapses projecting to Vim but also enables the recruitment of inhibitory neurons. A transient burst in the spiking activity of Vim during high-frequency DBS, prior to neuronal suppression, is likely providing sufficient network engagement to recruit inhibitory neurons that are silent during low-frequency DBS. Further, we detected a positive-going evoked-field potential effect, hereafter referred to as quasi-evoked inhibition, during high-frequency (100 Hz and 200 Hz) Vim-DBS in four out of 19 recording sites. Interestingly, it was observed that (i) neuronal suppression is stronger in these four neurons (P < 0.05), implying that inhibitory engagement during high-frequency DBS can further suppress neuronal firing, and (ii) quasi-evoked inhibition emerges after the transient burst (P < 1.00 x 10-7), i.e., the latter may give rise to the former. By removing DBS artifacts with a novel algorithm and characterizing the dynamics of quasi-evoked inhibitory activity, we showed that the likelihood of occurrence of this inhibitory activity negatively correlated with the instantaneous firing rate (P < 1.00 x 10-5). These results suggest that an excitatory-inhibitory balance is likely regulating Vim activities during high-frequency DBS. Our findings shed light on potential network mechanisms underlying Vim-DBS, which can provide insight for optimizing DBS by designing new stimulation patterns.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus broadcasts the head-direction (HD) signal, which is generated in the brainstem, particularly in the upstream lateral mammillary nucleus, and thalamic HD cells remain coordinated even during sleep. Here, by recording and manipulating neuronal activity along the mammillary-thalamic-cortical pathway, we show that coherence among thalamic HD cells persists even when their upstream inputs are decorrelated, particularly during non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep. These findings suggest that thalamic circuits are sufficient to generate and maintain coherent population dynamics in the absence of structured input.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

In response to surprising events, this process is thought to be modulated by the locus-coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) arousal system, observable via pupil dilations (PDs). Pertinent literature has mostly focused on conscious, high-level decision-making and estimation processes, while assuming that the same principles apply to low-level sensory perceptual decision-making and generalize across tasks, domains and modalities. To address some of these assumptions, we devised a novel perceptual discrimination paradigm, investigating behavior and PDs across auditory domains. Participants were presented with auditory sequences of randomized length at a rapid pace, changing intermittently between two latent states: acceleration vs. deceleration (temporal group, N = 25) and clockwise vs. counterclockwise movement (spatial group, N = 22). Under high uncertainty, participants continuously inferred latent states to report the final state per sequence. To extract per-stimulus estimates of PDs during sequences, we fitted a deconvolution-based general linear model to the continuous pupil traces with a free amplitude parameter reflecting ongoing PDs. A Bayesian observer model was fitted to participants' responses and used to estimate information gain and surprisal for every stimulus. Participants' performance and PDs showed strong sensitivity to the occurrence of change-points. Both computational variables significantly predicted PDs in both domains, with information gain outperforming surprisal in a model comparison. Further model comparison revealed significant preference for models excluding possible domain-specific effects over models including them, pointing towards a constant effect over domains. We conclude that behavior and associated PDs observed in our purely perceptual auditory task align with Bayesian principles of belief updating. The observed lack of domain specificity supports the assumed generalizability of belief updating.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamics play a critical role in regulating signaling pathways and metabolic activities in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Increased mitochondrial fission drives metabolic reprogramming, enabling CRCs to proliferate, metastasize, and resist chemotherapy. Paradoxically, excessive fission induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Our previous studies have shown that hematopoietic stem cell-derived conditioned media (CM) modulate the apoptosis pathway and mitochondrial bioenergetics of cancer stem cells by altering the cancer microenvironment. In this study, we found that HSCs-CM facilitates excessive fission in colorectal cancer cells by modulating Drp-1 and inducing the mitophagy-mediated apoptosis pathway, leading to the clearance of these cells. Moreover, proteomics data showed that HSCs-CM dysregulated the electron transport chain complexes, with an exceptionally high degree of dysregulation of complexes III and IV. Metabolomics and RNA sequencing revealed the dysregulation of critical proteins involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics and the autophagy pathway in CRCs treated with CM.

K.; Campos Lira, E.; Ongolo, M. B.; Filosa, J. A.; Sterm, J. E.", "abstract": "Background: Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is essential for matching cerebral blood flow (CBF) to neuronal activity. While cortical NVC has been studied extensively, particularly in the context of sensory processing, little is known about NVC dynamics in deep brain regions, such as the hypothalamus, especially under disease conditions like heart failure (HF), where impaired cortical NVC has been linked to cognitive decline. Our goal in this study was to investigate salt-induced NVC responses in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) of rats with HF, and to determine the role of microglial purinergic signaling in modulating these responses. Methods: Using in vivo two-photon imaging and real-time oxygen measurements in the SON, we assessed neurovascular responses to a systemic salt challenge in a well-established HF rat model that mimics clinical outcomes observed in the human population. Pharmacological and biosensor approaches were employed to dissect the contribution of key vasoactive mediators. Results: Contrary to our original hypothesis, that HF would exacerbate salt-evoked inverse NVC (iNVC; vasoconstriction and hypoxia) as previously reported by our group in healthy rats, in HF, the NVC response was reversed. Here, salt-induced neuronal activation triggered vasodilation and increased SON pO2, restoring oxygen levels to those of sham controls. This vasodilation was mediated by adenosine acting on A2A receptors and originated from a putative microglial source. Importantly, a masked, enhanced AVP-mediated vasoconstrictive component was still present, as revealed by biosensor assays, indicating a complex interplay between opposing vasoactive signals during HF. Conclusions: These findings reveal a previously unrecognized microglia-driven purinergic mechanism that overrides AVP-mediated vasoconstriction to restore SON oxygenation during salt challenges in HF. The polarity switch in hypothalamic NVC suggests a region- and disease-specific adaptation with potential relevance to neurohumoral dysregulation in HF.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Because of difficult access and fragility of cochlear structures, our understanding of intracochlear anatomy has historically relied on postmortem histology. We thus have a limited understanding of human cochlear anatomy in its native, unfixed state. Clinical diagnostics for hearing loss, such as audiometry and otoacoustic emissions, offer functional assessments but fail to elucidate the often diverse underlying structural pathologies with any degree of precision. To address the critical need for assessing the human cochlear anatomy and associated pathologies without the risk of traumatizing cochlear structures, we imaged fresh cochleae in situ soon after death through the intact round window membrane with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) without inserting instruments inside or opening the cochlea. Micron-resolution OCT cross-sectional images of the human intracochlear structures were acquired and compared with corresponding histology systematically to aid in the identification of fine structural features and possible pathologies. With OCT imaging, we observed varied anatomy of the organ of Corti, and developed a cochlear ''integrity'' rating system to differentiate healthy appearing cochleae from various pathological states. These results demonstrate the capability of OCT to non-traumatically visualize cochlear integrity, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool.

Using streptozotocin-induced mouse models of T1D and T2D, we observed increased luminal fluid in the small intestine of both. Given the role of Na/H exchanger 3 (NHE3) in fluid absorption and its loss in most diarrheal diseases, we examined NHE3 expression across intestinal segments. In T1D, the NHE3 protein was significantly reduced in the duodenum and jejunum without changes in mRNA, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. In contrast, T2D mice exhibited reduced NHE3 protein and mRNA, restricted to the proximal colon. To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying NHE3 loss in T1D, we evaluated endosomal scaffolding proteins involved in NHE3 trafficking. While our previous work showed that the Sorting Nexin-27 (SNX27)-retromer complex does not regulate NHE3 protein stability, we found that SNX17 was significantly decreased in the small intestine of T1D mice but unchanged in T2D. SNX17 knockdown in SK-CO15 cells reduced NHE3 activity and stability. A GST pull-down assay showed that SNX17 interacts with the C-terminus of NHE3. Mutation of the NHE3 distal NPxY motif disrupted this interaction, leading to reduced NHE3 expression and increased degradation. These findings reveal segment-specific and mechanistically distinct causes of diabetic diarrhea in T1D versus T2D, and identify SNX17 loss as a contributor to reduced NHE3 stability and activity in T1D, likely promoting diabetic diarrhea.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Through comparative profiling of modified nucleotides in rhizome samples at different developmental stages and/or subjected to various treatments, we identified a number of key rhizome-related tRNA modifications and revealed that, akin to the observations in many non-plant organisms, tRNA modifications are associated with hormonal signalling to regulate rhizomes' responses to environmental cues.

While latency has classically been attributed to peripheral sensory ganglia, accumulating evidence indicates that the central nervous system (CNS) also act as a relevant reservoir for viral latency and reactivation. Here, we investigated the CNS as a site of latency using the attenuated mutant PrV-{Delta}UL21/US3{Delta}kin which reproduces key features of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in female CD1 mice. We mapped brain regions permissive to alphaherpesviral latency and analyzed the temporal dynamics of viral transcription, histopathology, and host clinical and immune responses. Following intranasal inoculation, mice were analyzed at 11 to 14, 21, 28, 42, 105, and 190 days post infection (dpi). To assess the potential of reactivation, a subset received cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone at 170 dpi. Viral transcripts were detected by RNAscope in situ hybridization and RT-qPCR targeting the lytic gene UL19 and the latency-associated transcript (LAT). Histopathological analyses included hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry for CD3, Iba1, GFAP, and cleaved caspase-3. Major capsid protein (UL19) expression displayed marked regional and temporal heterogeneity, with prominent signals in mesiotemporal structures (piriform cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex), coinciding with pronounced T-cell infiltration. LAT expression remained overall low, with a transient peak during the acute infection (11-14 dpi). RT-qPCR confirmed high viral transcript levels for both UL19 and LAT in mesiotemporal regions during early infection, while LAT expression returned to baseline levels thereafter. Histopathology demonstrated a transition from acute necrotizing meningoencephalitis to prolonged or recurrent low-grade inflammation, accompanied by glial activation and localized apoptosis. Notably, UL19 expression strongly correlated with CD3+ T-cell infiltration, particularly at 42 dpi.

Despite the high-dimensionality of the musculoskeletal system, both humans and other species are able to quickly adapt their existing repertoire of actions to novel settings. A strategy likely employed by the brain to accomplish such a feat is known as compositionality, or the ability to combine learned computational primitives to perform novel tasks. Previous works have demonstrated that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a useful tool to probe compositionality during diverse cognitive tasks. However, the attractor-based computations required for cognition are largely distinct from those required for the generation of movement, and it is unclear whether compositional structure extends to RNNs producing complex movements. To address this question, we train a multitasking RNN in feedback with a musculoskeletal arm model to perform ten distinct types of movements at various speeds and directions, using visual and proprioceptive feedback. The trained network expresses two complementary forms of composition: an algebraic organization that groups tasks by kinematic and rotational structure to enable the flexible creation of novel tasks, and a sequential strategy that stitches learned extension and retraction motifs to produce new compound movements. Across tasks, population activity occupied a shared, low-dimensional manifold, whereas activity across task epochs resides in orthogonal subspaces, indicating a principled separation of computations. Additionally, fixed-point and dynamical-similarity analyses reveal reuse of dynamical motifs across kinematically aligned tasks, linking geometry to mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate rapid transfer to held-out movements via simple input weight updates, as well as the generation of target trajectories from composite rule inputs, without altering recurrent dynamics, highlighting a biologically plausible route to within-manifold generalization. Our framework sheds light on how the brain might flexibly perform a diverse range of movements through the use of shared low-dimensional manifolds and compositional representations.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Our findings reveal that zebrafish macrophages undergo large transcriptomic changes along different wound healing phases, particularly between 2 and 5 hours post-amputation, suggesting a fast reprogramming leading to different functional states. We further show that, at 2h, macrophages acquire a pro-inflammatory profile with a gene signature closed to M1 signature. At 5h, macrophages express genes involved in immunoregulation and healing associated with shutoff of pro-inflammatory pathways and the activation of glucose and glycogen metabolism. Finally, we show that macrophage reprogramming becomes deeply attenuated by 29h.

Here, we applied a meta-analytic mixed model approach to quantify how immune-pathway genes differ from other genes in their rates of protein sequence divergence (dN/dS), evidence for positive selection, and gene turnover rate ({lambda}), while simultaneously accounting for gene length, expression level, genetic and protein-protein interactions, and structural features such as relative solvent accessibility (RSA). In general, rates of sequence evolution were strongly and positively associated with RSA, and negatively with gene length, expression, and genetic/protein-protein interactions, while gene turnover rate was largely unaffected by these factors. We find immune genes evolved significantly faster at the protein sequence level than non-immune genes, but contrary to our expectation exhibited lower gene turnover rates. Functional and pathway-level analyses revealed accelerated evolution in effectors, receptors, and antiviral genes, with cGAS-STING and Toll pathways showing the highest dN/dS. Gene turnover rate was elevated only in effectors, whereas cellular defence genes were particularly conserved. We also found evidence for elevated proportion of sites under episodic positive selection in immune genes, particularly in effectors, indicating ongoing adaptive diversification.

Comparing different shear stress exposure to endothelial cells for 24 h, prominent ferroptosis features emerged under either LSS or HSS compared to MSS. These features included increased C11 BODIPY-labeled lipid peroxidation and 4-hydroxynonenal accumulation, CoQ10 depletion, reduced SLC7A11 protein expression, and diminished cell death with Ferrostatin-1 treatment. RNA-seq analysis (LSS/MSS) showed that LSS significantly downregulated transcription of cholesterol homeostasis and unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to MSS, Western blot results showed that both LSS and HSS reduced the expression of two key enzymes (MVD and IDI1) in the mevalonate pathway, as well as the expression of two main UPR signaling regulators (PERK and BiP). Based on the binding prediction between transcription factors and gene promoters from differentially expressed genes identified through RNA-seq, we found KLF6 to be a key transcription factor. It regulates the PERK-mediated UPR and the mevalonate pathway, which are associated with SLC7A11 expression and CoQ10 synthesis, respectively. The overexpression of KLF6 restored SLC7A11 and CoQ10 levels under both LSS and HSS, significantly reducing foam cell formation, monocyte adhesion, and lipid peroxidation.

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for identifying threats to population viability and predicting evolutionary trajectories of invasive populations translocated by humans into non-native environments. We investigated these processes in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) by estimating genetic loads in multiple populations, with a particular focus on a single expanding population where translocated individuals have rapidly spread and replaced native populations. Overall, we observed the expected negative relationship between neutral genetic diversity and relative genetic load. In the translocated population, patterns differed between strongly and weakly deleterious mutations. Strongly deleterious alleles were purged at the isolated translocation site but tended to accumulate along the expansion front. In contrast, genetic load estimated based on weakly deleterious variants declined along the expansion gradient. These differing patterns can be explained by admixture with native populations (which carried fewer weakly deleterious mutations) reducing the overall genetic load of the population at the expansion front.

C.", "abstract": "A central paradox in evolutionary biology is the rarity of asexual reproduction, which is often attributed to developmental constraints and long-term costs. Yet, fissiparous asexuality-where animals split and regenerate-is widespread among planarians, hinting at genomic features predisposing them to asexuality. We investigated the genomic underpinnings and evolutionary consequences of asexuality in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, which exists as both obligately fissiparous and sexual strains. We generated a haplotype-phased genome assembly of the asexual strain and collected population genomic data from laboratory and wild populations to uncover extensive heterozygous chromosomal rearrangements affecting all chromosomes. We show that these rearrangements arose in a sexually reproducing ancestor without directly disrupting reproductive genes but instead progressively suppressing recombination across the genome. The asexual genome exhibits minimal deleterious mutation accumulation, indicating a low cost of asexuality. Population-genomic data show this strain lacks any detectable sexual reproduction and originated recently (0.17-0.4 Ma), but the young age is insufficient to explain the low mutational burden. Instead, planarians may be able to exploit the lack of a single-cell bottleneck in fissiparous reproduction to mitigate the costs of asexuality. Altogether, our results support a model in which stepwise recombination suppression due to structural rearrangements eroded the benefits of sex and enabled the emergence of fissiparous asexuality in S. mediterranea.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

However, little is known about how selection acting on a balanced inversion shifts in different environments in the context of demographic events. Here, we combine population genomic approaches with extensive simulations to show that split events of island populations shifted a parameter of balancing selection on a polymorphic inversion. In Eurasian blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla), an 8 Mb-long inversion has been maintained polymorphic in most populations across the specie's distribution range by long-term balancing selection. The frequency of this inversion is consistently lower in island resident and continental resident populations compared to behaviourally ancestral continental migrant populations. Inference of population history shows that at least four groups of residents, specifically one continental population and three sets of populations on different island systems, originate from independent and simultaneous split events from one ancestral population. Such a demographic history indicates that the consistent reduction in the inversion frequency among these independent resident populations is unlikely due to shared stochastic events. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) applied to simulations of balancing selection under the blackcap demography indicates that the optimal frequency of the inversion in the regime of negative frequency-dependent selection, a type of balancing selection, became lower in island populations. These results highlight how parallel shifts in selection parameters in similar environments can contribute to genetic differentiation among populations at inversion loci.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

HPPL and PEVs were prepared from clinical-grade platelet concentrates; protein content and antioxidant capacity were quantified, and PEVs were further characterized for size, particle concentration, platelet and EV markers. Neuronal cells were pretreated with 5% HPPL or PEVs before rotenone (5 M) exposure; embryos received 20 ug/mL HPPL or PEVs before rotenone (200 nM). Mitochondrial assessments included ATP production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial membrane potential, ultrastructure, and expression of biogenesis and fusion markers. Impact on cell viability was also determined. Our in vitro data demonstrate that both HPPL and PEVs restored ATP, reduced ROS, preserved mitochondrial membrane potential and morphology, as well as upregulated PGC-1alpha and MFN1, ultimately leading to increased cell survival. In zebrafish, pretreatment with platelet biomaterials improved developmental abnormalities, survival and hatching, reduced ROS, and preserved mitochondrial ultrastructure.

However, ensuring that this method remains reliable under real-world signal degradations is crucial for its broader application. Therefore, we investigated the impact of three commonly modeled signal degradations on convolutive blind-source-separation (BSS) MU decomposition. 192 HD-sEMG channels were recorded from the forearm muscles of thirteen healthy participants during six wrist movements. Three broad categories of perturbation were introduced, including additive white Gaussian noise (WGN), channel loss, and electrode shift. These perturbations were chosen to mimic challenges encountered in practice, such as ambient electrical noise, electrode failures, and sensor displacement in order to test the MU decomposition algorithm's sensitivity. Then, the effects of perturbations on the quantity and quality of extracted MUs and neural drive estimation were assessed. Under non-perturbed conditions, an average of 179 {+/-} 40 MUs were extracted. Severe global WGN significantly reduced extracted MUs by approximately 81%. In contrast, more localized WGN, or channel loss as high as 15%, and electrode shift had minimal impact, with reductions in the number of MU decomposed being less than 6%. Reconstruction of neural drive through smoothed cumulative spike trains was significantly impaired by global WGN, thus leading to increased root mean square error when compared to conditions, while localized perturbations had negligible effects. Therefore, the BSS-based MU decomposition methods seem to be robust against localized noise, channel loss, and minor electrode shifts but are vulnerable to global additive noise. These results highlight the importance of carefully applying MU decomposition approaches in practical settings, maintaining high SNRs in EMG recordings, and preprocessing noise treatment to specific MU-decomposition needs.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

UPR activation occurred only in neurons with high mitochondrial activity. Unexpectedly, mitochondria-ER contacts were also abundant in the neurons that activated the UPR but virtually undetectable in neurons with low mitochondrial activity. In the human brain, strikingly, excitatory neurogranin neurons had the highest mitochondrial activity and triggered the UPR.

Yet, their relative roles in freely moving animals are poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel approach to study the neural mechanisms of visual spatial detection in unrestrained mice. We combined closed-loop presentation of visual stimuli with neural recordings, optogenetic manipulation, and simultaneous monitoring of eye and head position. Our results show that SC cells are more predictive of reaction times than V1 cells. Furthermore, SC neurons exhibit more sustained activity than V1 neurons during visual spatial detection. Optogenetic SC and V1 silencing causes pervasive and remarkably localized perturbations of visual detection performance. SC silencing has a stronger impact on visual detection than V1 silencing.

Optogenetic silencing during the context and delay periods impaired performance, suggesting that ALM contributes to configuring the appropriate contingency.

Reductionist systems have been instrumental in dissecting IS organization, but conventional systems constrain all ligands to be either mobile or immobile, unlike antigen-presenting cells where intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) is cytoskeletally anchored while T cell receptor (TCR) ligands remain mobile. Here, we establish mixed-mobility supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) that simultaneously present mobile TCR agonists and immobile ICAM1. Selective immobilization of ICAM1 disrupts centripetal F-actin flow, prevents centralization of TCR microclusters and shifts signaling to peripheral microclusters. This attenuates TCR downregulation through ectocytosis while maintaining recycling, and enhances integrin mechanotransduction, reflected in increased phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase, Paxillin and the stretch-sensitive adaptor CasL.

N.; Sethi, S.; Nandy, B.; Khan, I.", "abstract": "Insufficient protein intake, leading to malnutrition, is a major global health concern that compromises the immune system and increases susceptibility to diseases. In scenarios where protein availability is constrained, organisms may experience strong selection to efficiently allocate their resources between immunity vs other energy-demanding processes, such as reproduction, resulting in evolutionary trade-offs. Additionally, in many species, protein deficiency has a more significant impact on female reproduction than on males, potentially leading to pronounced sexually dimorphic trade-offs involving immunity and infection outcomes. However, there are no experiments to test these possibilities. In this work, we demonstrate that in Drosophila melanogaster populations selected for increased early-life reproduction under protein limitations, evolved virgin females indeed suffered a greater reduction in their resistance to the pathogen Providencia rettgeri and showed lower survival following infection than males, corroborating our expectations. However, mating resulted in a loss of sexually dimorphic infection outcomes, causing both sexes to exhibit nearly identical infection costs and reduced infection tolerance compared to their ancestral, unselected populations. Moreover, several immune components, including the Toll- and IMD-mediated inducible immune pathways, were either less upregulated or more downregulated in the selected flies, which may contribute to their heightened susceptibility to pathogens. Downregulation in key metabolic pathways and genes related to phagocytosis, melanisation and ROS-mediated defence after infection in selected flies can also be associated with their increased pathogen vulnerability. Taken together, our work thus reveals the reproductive status- and sex-specific plasticity of immune investments and post-infection health in response to evolutionary constraints under chronic protein deprivation.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Here we experimentally characterized loss of mating-type switching in a representative panel of strains. Analysis of 117 telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies revealed multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in the Ho endonuclease gene and structural variants in the silent HML and HMR cassettes, the three loci essential for switching. We estimated that at least 13 independent transitions from homothallism to heterothallism have occurred in the species history. Analysis of the HO genotype of 2,915 strains show that at least 27% are heterothallic.

Heterothallic isolates are most prevalent in domesticated and clinical clades, consistent with an origin linked to human-associated environments. However, they are also found, though less frequently, in natural niches.

S.; Nguyen, A.; Moran, J.; Kidd, J. M.", "abstract": "Background Due to their history of domestication and breed formation, dogs are a powerful system for studying the phenotypic impact of genetic variation. Comparison of canine genome assemblies show that retrotransposons, mobile elements which mobilize through an RNA intermediate, are a major contributor to canine genetic diversity with an eightfold and 17-fold increase of LINE-1 and SINE differences, respectively, in dogs relative to that found among humans. The frequency of dimorphic retrotransposon insertions among dogs suggests these elements have mobilized at a high rate over recent canine evolution. However, the rate at which new insertions arise has yet to be determined. Results We aligned a collection of genome assemblies derived from four breed dogs, a Dingo, and an American grey wolf to a Greenland grey wolf to identify dimorphic LINE-1 and SINEC insertions. Across our panel of seven canine assemblies, we identified a total of 7,428 dimorphic LINE-1s and 51,572 dimorphic SINECs. Each assembly differs from the Greenland wolf genome by an average of 3,497 LINE-1s and 25,558 SINECs. Analysis of allele sharing among samples recapitulates known relationships and reveals substantial within-breed variation. Calibrating estimates using a previously estimated single nucleotide mutation rate of 4.5x10-9 per base pair per generation, we estimate that new LINE-1 and SINEC and insertions have occurred at a rate of 1/184 and 1/22 births over recent canine evolution. These estimates are largely consistent across assemblies and breeds. Conclusions Our phylogenetic estimate of SINEC retrotransposition in canines is approximately twice as large as that estimated for Alu in humans, while the canine LINE-1 insertion rate is within the range of human estimates. These data suggest that although SINEC has been an outsized driver of canine genome evolution, the striking levels of canine LINE-1 and SINEC dimorphism mainly reflect high levels of long-standing genetic variation.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

In this study, we addressed this critical challenge by fabricating sub-200 nm channel geometries using modified electron-beam-lithography and reactive-ion-etching protocols to physically constrain the trajectories of kinesin-driven microtubules and enhance path fidelity. Investigating junction designs with varying channel widths, we demonstrate that reducing channel width significantly lowers junction error rates. Practically error-free junction performance was achieved by scaling down the entire network geometry by a factor of two. These optimized junctions were incorporated into NBC networks that successfully solved 24- and 25-set instances of the Exact Cover problem, representing solution spaces of approximately 16 million and 33 million, respectively. This work establishes a new benchmark in NBC performance and represents a computational scale far beyond what has been achieved in prior demonstrations.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We developed a human iPSC-derived neuronal co-culture model that captures acute communication between neurons and glioblastoma from diverse sources, including serum-adapted cell lines and patient-derived cells. Within 24 hours, glioma-exposed neurons exhibited synaptic remodeling and activation of tumor-associated signaling pathways. High-resolution imaging and proteomics revealed compartment-specific synaptic alterations, with ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling differentially engaged depending on the tumor source, corresponding to distinct structural and functional outcomes. Pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK components both suppressed tumor cells growth and preserved neuronal integrity. By modeling source-dependent and early neuron-tumor interactions, this platform not only identifies MAPK signaling as a critical mediator of synaptic vulnerability but also provides a clinically relevant tool for investigating the mechanisms of glioblastoma recurrence. It offers a framework for developing therapies that target the dual vulnerabilities of tumor progression and circuit remodeling.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

As major regulators of epigenetic processes, histone deacetylases (HDACs) have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for cognitive enhancement in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the distinct roles of individual HDAC isoforms remain to be defined. Here, we report that HDAC9 is specifically expressed in neurons of human and mouse brains, and its expression declines with age. HDAC9 deficiency impairs cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in young mice. Selective deletion of HDAC9 in hippocampal CA1 neurons also induces cognitive impairment. In contrast, overexpression of HDAC9 in forebrain glutamatergic neurons preserves cognitive function in aged mice. Moreover, HDAC9 is also downregulated in the brain of AD mouse models, whereas neuronal overexpression of HDAC9 alleviates AD-related cognitive and synaptic deficits and reduces A{beta} deposition. Together, these findings suggest neuronal HDAC9 is necessary and sufficient for maintaining cognitive and synaptic functions in the context of aging and AD.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

The lateral hypothalamus (LH) is a brain structure that integrates cognitive and sensory information to tightly regulate motivated behavior, including binge drinking. Importantly, LH function is vulnerable to modulation by the pro-stress neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and acute antagonism of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) in the LH blunts binge drinking. However, the role of LH CRFR1 in chronic binge drinking is unknown. We used genetically targeted knockdown (KD) of CRFR1 in the LH of male and female mice followed by three weeks of binge drinking using the Drinking in the Dark (DID) model. CRFR1 KD in the posterior LH increased alcohol consumption, independent of sex, with no effect of KD in the anterior LH. Consistent with this, total alcohol consumption was negatively correlated with the location of CRFR1 KD in the LH along the anterior-posterior axis. CRFR1 KD did not alter water consumption or body weight, suggesting the effects of CRFR1 KD on alcohol consumption were not due to broad disruption of fluid intake or homeostatic function. In contrast to the observed effects on binge drinking, CRFR1 KD increased anxiety-like behavior and blunted sucrose preference, independent of KD location in the LH. Our findings provide foundational insight into LH function in the context of AUD and prompt further investigation into the divergent roles that distinct circuitry or cell populations along the anterior-posterior axis of the LH may play in binge drinking.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We overexpressed active Adar isoforms or a catalytically-inactive Adar E374A protein from UAS-Adar constructs under the control of a temperature-regulated Act5Cts-GAL4 driver. Overexpression of the edited AdarG isoform or AdarEA cause larval lethality with aberrant innate immune induction. Some escaper pupae are formed with head eversion defects. AdarS overexpression is also lethal with no progeny pupae. Ecdysone signaling gene and innate immune gene expression are aberrantly elevated in the AdarG overexpressing pupae. RNAi knockdown of Ecdysone Receptor A (EcR A) or increasing expression of HP1 partially rescue AdarG overexpression defects and normalize gene expression in progeny flies, indicating that aberrant epigenetic silencing is also involved.

A Cryptochrome (CRY)-based radical pair mechanism (RPM) has been suggested to underlie the mechanistic basis of animal magnetosensitivity and navigation. The quantum spin state of a radical pair involving flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) bound to CRY in the canonical pocket is sensitive to external magnetic fields that can alter the signalling concentration of activated CRY. However, several experimental observations challenge this model including the finding that the C-terminal fragment of Drosophila CRY (DmCRY), which lacks any canonical FAD binding pocket, and human CRY2, which lacks affinity for FAD, are sufficient to support magnetosensitivity. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, alongside in vitro and in vivo analyses to reveal that the C-terminus of Drosophila CRY (DmCRY-CT) binds FAD. FAD binding is required for transduction of a magnetic signal within cells, and, in vitro, initiates formation of high molecular weight DmCRY-CT oligomers, including large insoluble aggregates reminiscent of CRY photobodies observed in plants. These results provide a plausible mechanistic basis for several experimental observations that have reported non-canonical magnetosensitivity in animals.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

One of the most striking finding in recent large ion mobility datasets is that CCS exhibits two distinct modes, most notably for charge 3+ peptides. Here, using classical machine learning approaches, we identify that basic site positioning is a key sequence feature determining if a peptide belongs to the high or low CCS mode. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that peptides in the high CCS mode tend to adopt more extended conformations and form charge-stabilized helical structures, whereas those in the low CCS mode adopt more compact, globular conformations. Further supporting this structural hypothesis, we provide evidence for preferential protonation near the C-terminus, and uncover multiple position-dependent sequence determinants that all suggest the predominance of helix formation in the high mode. Together, these findings will enable better integration of CCS measurements into protein identification and quantification pipelines, improving the performance of ion mobility-based proteomics.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

In this study, we combine experimental, computational, and clinical data analysis to investigate factors influencing the competition of subclones in lung cancer. Lineage tracing reveals unexpected variation in the long-term fate of neutral subclones, with subclones arising near the edge of tumours being favoured. Low levels of cell migration and cell mixing lead to high cell densities in the interior of the tumour that suppress proliferation. Using agent-based modelling and in silico analysis we inferred the extent of cell mixing in human tumours from the TRACERx lung cancer study. This reveals correlations between Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), stromal fibroblasts and levels of cell mixing. Experimental analysis confirms that both TGF{beta}-driven EMT and stromal fibroblasts reduce the variability in subclone fate and promote subclone mixing. Moreover, mixing favours clonal sweeps by subclones resistant to therapy-induced cell killing. Together, these analyses demonstrate that EMT and stromal fibroblasts sculpt tumour evolution by promoting cell mixing and thereby favour the rapid dominance of therapy resistant subclones.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Chemical groups susceptible to cleavage by enzymes present in tumors, tumor microenvironment or in normal tissues, have the potential to improve the therapeutic index for RPT. Using DOTA-TATE as an example and drawing from strategies used to develop antibody-drug conjugates, we designed, and synthesized, a chemically diverse series of linkers between the chelator (DOTA) and the targeting vector (TATE). Of the 10 agents we tested, two with cleavable linker domains reduced kidney retention compared to DOTA-TATE: the previously reported DOTA-MVK({epsilon})-TATE, and a novel agent bearing cleavable beta-galactose ({beta}-Gal) unit, DOTA-{beta}-Gal-TATE. In murine models of NETs, positron emission tomography (PET) was used to image yttrium-86 (86Y)-labeled variants and show that, while the 86Y-DOTA-MVK({epsilon})-TATE exhibits similar tumor uptake to the parent non-cleavable 86Y-DOTA-TATE, 86Y-DOTA-{beta}-Gal-TATE shows enhanced tumor uptake, resulting in up to 10-fold improvement in the tumor-to-kidney ratios compared to 86Y-DOTA-TATE. In vitro and in vivo studies confirm high efficiency, enzyme-specific cleavage of 86Y-DOTA-MVK({epsilon})-TATE and 86Y-DOTA-{beta}-Gal-TATE, supporting a key role for cleavable linker chemistry in the observed outcomes. RPT studies using actinium-225 (225Ac)-labeled variants confirm that all agents are therapeutically effective and well tolerated. While both cleavable variants exhibit superior local control, overall survival, and more favorable toxicity profile when compared with 225Ac-DOTA-TATE, 225Ac-DOTA-{beta}-Gal-TATE demonstrated lower nephrotoxicity.

We measured genome-scale DNA methylation in purified CLL samples (n=89) and utilized reference-based cell deconvolution techniques to develop a continuous metric of epigenetic similarity across a B-naive-like to B-memory-like scale (B-Index). B-Index accurately classifies CLL into clinical subtypes (98.8%), has a stronger epigenetic signal than IGHV gene percent identity, and demonstrates additional epigenetic signal within the M-CLL subgroup. We demonstrate that U-CLL is epigenetically more similar to B-memory than B-naive cells and reconcile previous reports of a B-naive-like epigenetic signal. The B-memory-like program of U-CLL is enriched for binding sites of transcription factors related to the germinal center activation pathway. Our findings provide epigenetic evidence for discerning CLL mechanisms of initiation and cell of origin.

We hypothesized that treatment fluctuations may either promote (antifragile tumor) or inhibit (fragile tumor) the evolution of treatment resistance to targeted therapies. Analysis of the convexity of dose response curves provides a direct prediction of response to prescribed fluctuations in treatment. Theory predicts that continuous treatment protocols (i.e. zero prescribed fluctuations in treatment) will outperform uneven protocols when dose response is convex. We apply this theory to predict in vivo response to targeted therapy and validate these predictions by experimentally testing high/low intermittent dosing (uneven dosing) and continuous dosing (even dosing) schedules. Convexity (and its inverse, concavity) explains two phenomena: dose response is a convex (fragile) function but resistance onset rate is a concave (antifragile) function. Thus, we design, propose, and validate alternative treatment schedules which maximize response while maintaining prolonged sensitivity to treatment. These analyses provide supporting evidence that fluctuations alter the evolutionary trajectory of tumors in response to targeted therapy, even without altering the cumulative dose. This insight is used to design alternative, switching treatment protocols to limit the evolution of resistance, a process which we call evolutionary antifragile therapy.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Compared to their offspring and matched controls, EL individuals exhibited a distinct metabolic profile characterized by higher levels of primary and secondary bile acids - most notably chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) - higher levels of biliverdin and bilirubin, and stable levels of selected steroids. Notably, elevated levels of both bile acids and steroids were associated with lower mortality. Several metabolites associated with age and survival were inversely associated with metabolite ratios related to NAD+ production and/or levels (tryptophan/kynurenine, cortisone/cortisol), gut bacterial metabolism (ergothioneine/ trimethylamine N-oxide, aspartate/quinolinate), and oxidative stress (methionine/methionine sulfoxide), implicating these pathways in aging and/or longevity. We further developed a metabolomic clock predictive of biological age, with age deviations significantly associated with mortality risk. Key metabolites predictive of biological aging, such as taurine and citrate, were not captured by traditional age analyses, pointing to their potential role as biomarkers for healthy aging.

Here, we chart an allosteric axis running through eIF2B, revealing the importance of a protrusive -helix in its {beta}-subunit, the latch-helix, that locks onto the -subunit to induce eIF2B activity. eIF2-P binding unhooks the latch-helix, opening eIF2B, which inhibits its GDP/GTP exchange activity. Distinct viral proteins have convergently evolved to bind to eIF2B and stabilize the latch-helix-bound active state. Using these insights, we generated ISR-ACTivating compounds, ISRACTs, that stabilize eIF2B in its inhibited, unlatched state. Our study thus highlights how state-transitions in eIF2B are regulated via long-range allostery.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We use 7T functional MRI (fMRI) to study 1) differences in somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps between FHD patients and age and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HV), 2) changes in cortical digit maps of FHD patients after BTX treatment. Methods: Four FHD patients underwent behavioural measures and 7T fMRI at two timepoints: ~30 days after BTX treatment at peak efficacy (Post-BTX), immediately prior to their next injection ~100 days after treatment when therapeutic effects had declined (Pre-BTX). HVs were scanned at a single time point. Behavioural measures included temporal discrimination (TDT), amplitude thresholding (AMP) and spatial acuity grating orientation tasks. A somatosensory travelling wave (TW) digit-mapping fMRI task was performed on dominant/affected and non-dominant/un-affected hands, and a motor TW digit-mapping task on the dominant/affected hand. Fourier analysis derived digit maps which were compared to a probabilistic digit atlas, and population receptive field (pRF) mapping performed. Structural and resting state fMRI data were acquired. Results: Spatial acuity was lowered in the dominant/affected hand in FHD compared to HVs, while TDT and AMP measures showed no significant differences. Somatosensory and motor TW cortical digit maps in FHD and HV showed clear digit ordering. Somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps were more disordered in the dominant/affected hand than the non-dominant hand for FHD Post and Pre-BTX compared to HVs (DICE coefficient/Figure of Merit). Compared to the atlas, HV maps were in-line for both hands, while in FHD central tendency (CT) was lower in the dominant/affected hand than non-dominant hand. pRF sizes were larger in the FHD Pre-BTX group compared to HV and Post-BTX for the dominant hand. Conclusion: Behaviourally, FHD patients had lower spatial acuity than HVs. FHD digit maps had typical D1-D5 ordering, but DICE coefficients identified a disordered dominant hand in FHD patients compared to HVs at both timepoints. The FHD Pre-BTX group had larger pRF sizes than Post-BTX and HVs, suggesting BTX treatment coincides with more localised touch perception.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

TAFFISH introduces a moderately engineered framework positioned between raw shell scripts and heavyweight workflow systems. It encapsulates each analysis tool, together with its fixed runtime environment and software version, into a modular, \"Lego-like\" component. It employs a lightweight, shell-native domain-specific language (DSL) to balance standardized environments with flexible workflow design. Each module in TAFFISH consists of a container image hosted on GitHub Packages and a corresponding script, and the system automatically pulls and runs the appropriate container when invoked through a unified interface. This design ensures a consistent interface, environment, and analysis results across Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL), significantly reducing cross-platform configuration overhead. We have developed a library of standardized modules for more than 60 widely used bioinformatics tools in the TAFFISH-Hub repository. As a demonstration, we applied a BLAST-based analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana P450 protein sequences and executed the same workflow on four different hardware/OS environments, obtaining identical results in all cases. This confirms that TAFFISH achieves high portability and reproducibility while preserving the flexibility of shell scripting.

Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a promising target for overcoming tumor resistance mechanisms. This study aimed to characterize the transcriptional landscape of ferroptosis-related genes in GAC, comparing tumor, peritumoral, metaplastic, and normal gastric tissues. Methods: RNA-Seq was performed on 385 biopsied samples from patients treated at the Joao de Barros Barreto University Hospital. Differential expression analysis was conducted using DESeq2, and genes related to ferroptosis were identified based on FerrDb V2 annotations. Visualization included volcano plots, DAPC clustering, heatmaps, and gene dominance scoring. Results: GAC samples showed a distinct ferroptotic expression signature, with simultaneous upregulation of key promoters (e.g., CDKN2A, NOX4, EGFR, IL6) and suppressors (e.g., HSPB1, SCD, NUPR1, GDF15). Notably, the tumor tissue exhibited a net dominance of ferroptosis-inhibitory genes, suggesting an adaptive response to oxidative stress. Adjacent tissues showed partial overlap with tumor profiles, while metaplastic tissue displayed a hybrid signature with selective suppression of ferroptosis. Normal mucosa exhibited dominant expression of promoters, contrasting with the tumor anti-ferroptotic phenotype. Conclusion: The transcriptional heterogeneity and regulatory imbalance of ferroptosis-related genes in GAC support its role as a potential therapeutic axis.

Here, we evaluate the performance of statistical differential expression methods on both simulated datasets and data collected from real bacterial 'mock communities' designed for this purpose. We assess the robustness of individual methods to organisms' low relative abundance, differential abundance, low prevalence, and transcription rate changes, showing that no existing methods perform adequately across all confounding conditions.

Normalization methods attempt to compensate, but rely on strong, often untestable assumptions that can bias inference. Experimental measurements of load (e.g., qPCR, flow cytometry) offer a solution, but remain costly and uncommon. A recent high-profile study proposed that machine learning could bypass this limitation by predicting microbial load from sequencing data alone. To evaluate this claim, we assembled mutt, the largest public database of paired sequencing and load measurements, spanning 35 studies and over 15,000 samples. Using mutt, we show that published machine learning models fail to generalize: on average they perform worse than a naive baseline that always predicted the training set mean. These failures stem from covariate shift-limited shared taxa between studies, differences in community composition, and differences in preprocessing pipelines-that silently derail model inputs. In contrast, Bayesian partially identified models do not attempt to impute microbial load, but instead propagate scale uncertainty through downstream analyses. Across 30 benchmark datasets, Bayesian partially identified models consistently outperformed normalization and machine learning approaches, providing a principled and reproducible foundation for microbiome inference.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

It has been suggested that non-psychoactive phytocannabinoids may have a better safety profile and could be used as an alternative approach to treat AUD. Hence, the aim of this study was to test the potential of three phytocannabinoids in reducing alcohol consumption: CB1 receptor partial agonist cannabinol (CBN), neutral antagonist tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and negative allosteric modulator cannabidiol (CBD). For this purpose, male Wistar rats were subjected to a long-term voluntary alcohol drinking procedure that lasted for at least 6 months. Thereafter, rats were given 3 daily administrations of CBN, THCV or CBD. A side-effect profile of all three compounds was measured by recording water consumption, body weight changes and home-cage locomotor activity. Ultrasonic vocalisations were recorded before and after a single administration of CBN, THCV or CBD in alcohol-naive group-housed rats to monitor if these compounds induced discomfort, distress or other changes in emotional states of rats. Our data demonstrated that all phytocannabinoids reduced voluntary alcohol consumption in rats. However, compounds differed in their effectiveness in reducing alcohol consumption and the side-effect profile. Treatment with CBN and THCV reduced alcohol intake and demonstrated a good safety profile. In contrast, CBD only had a minor effect on alcohol consumption, reduced the locomotor activity and lowered the positive emotional states of rats. None of the compounds caused discomfort or distress.

While abscission genes are linked to cancers and developmental disorders, the consequences of disrupted abscission in vivo have remained under-explored. For a polarized epithelium to expand or renew, cells within it must divide while maintaining polarity, cell junctions, and epithelial integrity. They undergo a polarized form of cytokinesis in which abscission occurs at the apical membrane. Here, we investigate how stochastic abscission failures in a polarized epithelium disrupt epithelial architecture, using mouse neuroepithelium as a model. Previously we showed that in the forebrain of Cep55 knockout (KO) mouse embryos, a subset of neuroepithelial stem cells (NSCs) fail abscission and become binucleate, and some of those undergo p53-mediated apoptosis. Here we use the Cep55 KO forebrain to focus on how disrupting abscission in a polarized epithelium affects the apical membrane structure. We find that NSCs in Cep55 KO neuroepithelium have preserved epithelial polarity and integrity. However, they have enlarged apical membranes (called apical endfeet), longer primary cilia, and increased bi-ciliation. We test whether the enlarged apical endfeet arise from filling the space of apoptotic neighbors. However, blocking apoptosis does not rescue but exacerbates the phenotypes: extra-large apical endfeet have further increased multi-ciliation, supernumerary centrosomes, and abnormal or multiple nuclei. These findings show the importance of proper abscission in a polarized epithelium to maintain epithelial structure, and the need for p53-mediated apoptosis to protect the tissue in the face of stochastic abscission failures.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Field experiments and evaluations were conducted in central Iowa, USA. The days to each of the reproductive stages, R1-R8, were recorded.

Despite its abundance in the liver, OAT mutations primarily cause gyrate atrophy (GA) and blindness. Paradoxically, adult GA patients have hyperornithinemia that is managed by arginine-restricted diet, while neonates experience hypoornithinemia and require arginine supplementation to prevent mortality in animal models. To understand this biochemical paradox, we performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of the liver, retina, and retinal pigment epithelium and choroid (RPE/Cho) in neonatal and adult Oatrhg mice, a whole-body OAT-deficient model. We found that the number of significantly altered proteins ranged from 5 to 254 across tissues and ages, with minimal changes in the adult retina and greatest changes in the adult RPE/Cho. OAT was the only protein consistently downregulated across all tissues. Neonatal liver proteome was more extensively altered than the adult liver proteome, primarily impacting metabolic pathways, including fatty acid oxidation, detoxification, cholesterol synthesis, and the urea cycle. In contrast, the adult liver showed changes mainly in detoxification and chromosome remodeling. Similarly, the neonatal retina was far more sensitive to OAT deficiency, with alterations not only in metabolism but also in visual transduction, ion and small molecule transport proteins. The RPE/Cho displayed the most pronounced changes in both age groups. In adults, several mitochondrial and signaling proteins were downregulated, while proteins in lipid metabolism, cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix (ECM) were upregulated. In neonates, the alterations were enriched in chromatin organization, ECM, and vesicle transport. In summary, our findings reveal that OAT is crucial for maintaining age- and tissue-specific proteome homeostasis, with its deficiency leading to alterations in mitochondrial, metabolic processes, and signaling pathways that extend far beyond its canonical role in ornithine metabolism.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Exploring such phase-separated systems beyond the naturally occurring scenarios may offer valuable insights for emergent synthetic biosystems. Here, we report the self-assembly behavior of a short, disordered peptide sequence (termed CT45) derived from a protein present in the bioadhesive system of tick ectoparasites. We show that CT45 spontaneously accumulates at polar-nonpolar interfaces, and further undergoes liquid-liquid and liquid-to-solid phase transitions to create mechanically stable structures. When encapsulated within vesicles and presented with a stable oil-water interface, CT45 rapidly forms solid shells, which can be reinforced by up-concentrating the material through osmotic imbalance. Unexpectedly, when presented with a transient acetone-water interface, CT45 condenses at the evaporating interface and forms interconnected, porous mesoscopic scaffolds.

Here, we present DiscERN (Discoverer of Evolutionarily Related Natural products), a user-friendly tool designed to address this gap. DiscERN leverages a multi-modal ensemble method that integrates four complementary algorithms classifying biosynthetic gene clusters based on Pfam content, sequence homology, and predicted product structure. This approach allows users to strategically balance discovery sensitivity with predictive precision to suit diverse research goals. We demonstrate DiscERN's utility by applying it to a large collection of actinomycete genomes and validating its predictive power through the successful isolation of discomycin A, a new calcium-dependent lipopeptide antibiotic, from a silent biosynthetic gene cluster. DiscERN provides a robust and accessible platform that streamlines the path from genomic data to a prioritised list of candidate biosynthetic gene clusters, effectively bridging the gap between in silico prediction and bioactive compound discovery.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

However, the incomplete understanding of these mechanisms has limited the development of effective therapies, especially for triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). Here, we demonstrate the lysosomal Ca2+;-release channel TRPML1 as a master regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetics in TNBC cells. TRPML1 knockdown (ML1-KD) in TNBC cells selectively compromises mitochondrial respiration, reprograms cell metabolism, and induces mitochondrial fragmentation without impacting non-cancerous cells. Mitochondria of ML1-KD TNBC cells sequester around the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), increasing mitochondria-ER contact sites at the expense of mitochondria-lysosomes contacts. Mechanistically, ML1-KD reduces lysosomal acidification, thus hindering autophagic flux and completion of autophagy. ML1-KD inhibits TFEB-mediated mitophagy and oxidative defense mechanisms while causing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, further impairing mitochondrial function. These alterations render ML1-KD TNBC cells highly sensitive to doxorubicin and paclitaxel at low doses that are typically ineffective on their own. Together, our findings establish TRPML1 as a critical inter-organelle regulator and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target to exploit the metabolic vulnerabilities of TNBC cells.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

F.; Maingrette, K.; Shah, S. S.; Bulatowicz, J. J.; Ebenezer, K.; Miri, A. K.; Wood, T. L.", "abstract": "Introduction: The insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1/IGF1R) pathway has been implicated in breast cancer aggressiveness; however, inhibition of this pathway has not been successful in clinical trials, indicating a lack of understanding about its role in TNBC metastasis. Recent studies have explored IGF1R involvement in integrin function and cancer cell adhesion dynamics. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that IGF1R itself regulates cancer cell adhesion. Methods: We use MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T TNBC cell lines, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and adhesion assays to assess how IGF1R and integrin knockdowns impact cancer cell adhesion. Using xCELLigence E-plates, we quantify the effect of IGF-1 ligand stimulation versus IGF1R knockdown on functional cell adhesion. We also use HUVEC human endothelial cells to determine how IGF1R regulates adhesion to the endothelium. Results: We found that IGF-1 stimulation increased MDA-MB-231 TNBC adhesion, which was reversed by the IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor BMS-754807 and the ligand-dependent receptor internalization inhibitor dansylcadaverine. Unexpectedly, IGF1R knockdown also potently stimulated cell adhesion. Concomitant {beta}1 integrin knockdown reversed the increased cell adhesion after both IGF-1 stimulation or IGF1R knockdown, indicating that the increased adhesion is {beta}1 integrin dependent. This was also seen via immunocytochemistry when cells were seeded on fibronectin. Finally, inhibiting IGF1R signaling also reduced MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion to HUVEC endothelial cells. Discussion: Both IGF-1 stimulation and IGF1R knockdown in TNBC cells promote cell adhesion, which seems paradoxical. However, the commonality of both interventions is removal of IGF1R from the cell surface, since IGF-1 stimulation causes IGF1R internalization and intracellular trafficking. Blocking IGF1R signaling using a tyrosine kinase IGF1R inhibitor preserves IGF1R on the cell surface. Thus, we propose a model whereby surface-bound IGF1R inhibits {beta}1 integrin function and blocks cell adhesion. This model is supported further by our finding that treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with dansylcadaverine, which inhibits ligand-mediated receptor internalization, blocked the effect of IGF-1 on adhesion. These findings may explain why selective IGF1R receptor antagonists, which downregulate IGF1R protein upon chronic administration, were unsuccessful in the clinical setting.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

The purpose of this study was to develop a novel biomaterial-based method to collect murine synovial fluid and elucidate onset mechanism of OA with acute synovitis and chronic mechanical stress. Method: Twelve-week-old C57BL/6J males (n = 72) were divided to the ACL-Transection (ACL-T), ACL-rupture (ACL-R), and Intact groups. We performed joint instability test and histological analysis for cartilage degeneration and synovitis at 2, 6, and 10 weeks. Real time PCR was conducted for articular cartilage at 2 weeks and synovium at 2, 6, and 10 weeks. Tetra-slime was injected into the knee joint and solidified slime including synovial fluid was analyzed in digital PCR at 2 weeks. Results: No difference was observed in joint instability between both ACL injury models. Unlike the Control and ACL-R groups, acute synovitis and secondary cartilage degeneration were induced in the ACL-T group at 2 weeks. The ACL-T group also exhibited an increase of Mmp-3, Tnf-, Ifn-{gamma}, and inos in synovium, and miR145-5p and miR149-5p in synovial fluid compared to the ACL-R group. However, no histological and biological differences were observed at 6 and 10 weeks. Conclusion: We successfully analyzing synovial fluid miRNAs in mice model using Tetra-Slime. Acute synovitis caused secondary cartilage degeneration through MMP-3, TNF-, and M1 macrophage activation in synovium during the early stage, whereas miR145-5p and miR149-5p in synovial fluid were upregulated to prevent the progression.

However, to address the concerns of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids, other malaria control strategies are being explored for effectively blocking malaria transmission by eliminating or reducing the parasite in the vector. This study evaluated the use of antimalarials through tarsal contact of female Anopheles darlingi infected with Plasmodium vivax via a Direct Membrane Feeding Assay (DMFA). Female An. darlingi were exposed tarsally using Petri dishes impregnated with antimalarials at 1 mmol/m2 for exposure times of 6 or 60 minutes. Among the antimalarials evaluated were Atovaquone (ATQ), Tafenoquine (TQ), Chloroquine (CQ), Mefloquine (MQ), Primaquine (PQ), and the compound Nanchangmycin (NCG). Atovaquone was the only antimalarial evaluated before and after DMFA at exposure times of 60 min and 6 min. The results demonstrate complete elimination of P. vivax in female An. darlingi exposed to ATQ by tarsal contact 60 min before infection. ATQ was also effective 6 min before or after infection, reducing infection prevalence.

Resurgent infections, driven by insufficient vaccine coverage, waning herd immunity, and the vulnerability of immunocompromised individuals, highlight the urgent need for effective countermeasures. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent a promising strategy, both as antiviral agents and as probes of viral entry mechanisms. While most vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies target the hemagglutinin (H) protein, emerging evidence suggests that antibodies against the fusion (F) protein are also potent inhibitors. Still, there is insufficient information on the target sites and activities of antibodies against the F protein. Like other class I fusion proteins, MeV F exists in a metastable prefusion state that undergoes dramatic conformational changes during viral entry. Here, we selected four mAbs that recognize conformational patterns of F-prefusion and/or postfusion, characterized their epitopes, specificities, and antiviral activities. Structural analyses mapped antibody interactions onto pre- and postfusion F conformations, revealing that all three neutralizing mAbs are specific for the prefusion form, while the non-neutralizing mAb recognizes only the postfusion F. Biophysical and functional assays defined distinct mechanisms: neutralization occurs either by stabilizing the prefusion protein or by preventing the extended intermediate from completing fusion. We also describe a novel mechanism of neutralization in which an antibody prematurely triggers F activation but blocks the subsequent refolding required for viral entry. Together, these findings provide the first detailed mapping of neutralizing epitopes on the MeV F protein and establish a framework for the rational design of F-targeted intervention.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Comparative genomic analyses have shown no major differences between virulent and attenuated B. bovis strains, suggesting that studies on the hosts differential response may represent a key step toward clarifying the basis of disease severity and vaccine efficacy. In this study, we analyzed by RNA-seq the differential gene expression in bovine monocyte-derived macrophages after phagocytosis of erythrocytes infected with either the virulent B. bovis S2P strain or the attenuated R1A one. The results revealed a common transcriptional core response of several cellular processes largely centered on lymphocyte related functions, cytokine regulation, and adaptive immune signaling. In turn, the two strains elicited contrasting responses in bovine macrophages, where the virulent strain induced the enrichment of lymphocyte- and antiviral-related pathways, and the attenuated strain led to a stronger pro-inflammatory, chemotactic, and extracellular matrix remodeling signatures. Taken together, these data improved our understanding of the early transcriptional events that develop in macrophages in response to the phagocytosis of red blood cells containing contrasting B. bovis strains.

VirScan revealed unique viral exposure histories for each individual. At the antibody level, we observed strong protein-level immunodominance, with viral surface proteins consistently recognized across individuals, but striking variability at the epitope level, even within immunodominant proteins. At the functional level, differential protein expression analysis showed that prior infection with HSV-1, HSV-2, or norovirus was associated with elevated production of CCL4, MCP-2, and TNF, respectively, following TLR7/8 stimulation, indicating virus-specific imprints on innate immune responses. Together, these findings suggest that both chronic and acute viral infections are major drivers of immune variation and can leave lasting signatures on innate function. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of broad viral serology with systems-level innate profiling to investigate how lifetime exposures shape human immune variability.

At cGVHD onset, in addition to changes in the myeloid compartment, two distinct populations of CD8+T cells with a TEXEF phenotype were prevalent: an inflammatory CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_4) expressing CCL4, CD69, and TNFSF9, and an exhausted CD8T cell cluster (CD8T_5) characterized by the expression of CXCL13, HIF1A, and HLA-DRA, both correlated with clinical disease severity. Pseudo-time analysis suggests a transition from the inflammatory pre-exhausted CD8T_4 cluster to the cytolytic, terminally exhausted CD8T_5 cluster. The CXCL9-CXCR3 interactions among CD8+ T cells, fibroblasts and myeloid cells are implicated in tissue damage.

Here, we evaluated NK cell receptor expression on isolated NK cells from a Panamanian cohort of ZIKV-infected participants, and corresponding NK receptor ligand expression on participant PBMCs and ZIKV-infected cells in vitro using mass cytometry. We found that during acute ZIKV infection, NK cells express high levels of activation markers, proliferative markers, and cytotoxic effector proteins, indicating that NK cells are mounting a response to ZIKV.

Both proteins are highly conserved across herpesviruses and likely perform similar functions in virion assembly and egress, with the gM/gN complex being essential for HCMV morphogenesis. To elucidate the function of the gM/gN complex in secondary envelopment, we employed a combination of viral mutants, siRNA knockdown experiments, and ultrastructural analyses. A detailed examination of the virion morphogenesis of a mutant virus with a cysteine-to-serine mutation in the cytoplasmic tail of gN (TB-gN-C123S) showed a defect in the initiation of secondary envelopment, as most capsids in TB-gN-C123S-infected cells were either not in contact with cytoplasmic membranes or, when near membranes, lacked signs of budding. The defect in initiation of secondary envelopment was associated with an accumulation of partially tegumented capsids in the peripheral region of the cytoplasmic viral assembly compartment (cVAC), whereas wild-type virus-infected cells predominantly accumulated enveloped capsids in the central area of the cVAC. Additionally, large protein aggregates were observed within and near the cVAC, often associated with non-enveloped capsids. A comparable ultrastructural phenotype, including altered capsid distribution, envelopment defect, and protein aggregation, was observed in wild-type virus-infected cells treated with siRNA against gM. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the altered distribution of capsids in the cVAC in wild-type virus-infected cells with reduced or undetectable gM levels, resembling the pattern observed in TB-gN-C123S-infected cells. Further evidence underscoring the role of the gM/gN glycoprotein complex in viral morphogenesis was obtained by investigating gM- and gN-null mutants, which displayed the same altered capsid distribution observed in TB-gN-C123S infections and after siRNA knockdown of gM. Finally, the inhibition of palmitoylation using 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) in wild-type virus-infected cells resulted in analogous defects, including an accumulation of partially tegumented capsids in the periphery of the cVAC and protein aggregates associated with capsids. In summary, our findings indicate a crucial role for the gM/gN complex in initiating the secondary envelopment of partially tegumented capsids and highlight the involvement of palmitoylation in this process. Defects in the initiation of secondary envelopment are associated with an altered spatial distribution of capsids within the cVAC.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

While microbiome research has focused primarily on bacterial dynamics, the long-term history of gut viral communities (the virome) remains largely unexplored, despite their crucial role in shaping bacterial populations. We analyzed gut viromes from 13 pre-modern human coprolites (21 BCE - 1500 CE), as well as 371 non-industrialized and 417 industrialized contemporary human fecal samples. We found that, over time and with industrialization, gut viral communities have become functionally homogenized, increasingly dominated by temperate lifestyles, less likely to infect problematic bacteria, more supportive of bacterial pathogenicity, and depleted in genes that help bacteria combat stress and toxicity. These synergistic ecological shifts suggest that long-term changes, especially with industrialization, have fundamentally altered the gut virome, likely affecting human health. These insights into historical shifts in gut viral community and function open potential avenues for ecologically grounded therapeutics to enhance gut microbiome resilience.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We developed a workflow to identify experiment-specific contaminants from a small-scale, preliminary sequencing run. This enables the design of locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides that target the contaminating fragments, thereby preventing their amplification during library preparation. This process requires only a single pipetting step and no additional purification. In a proof-of-concept experiment, just five LNAs reduced contaminating fragments by over 30 %, doubling the amount of useful sequencing data from Ribo-Seq experiments.

We further show that, although Ypq1 can mediate proton-independent vacuolar lysine import, it mainly functions as a lysine exporter necessary for lysine mobilization under conditions of lysine scarcity and downregulated as lysine stores are exhausted. Using quantitative models based on dynamic metabolic labeling, we further show that, surprisingly, in growing cells, CAA rapidly exchange between vacuolar and cytosolic compartments, a process involving the export activity of Ypq1 and its paralogue Ypq2, specific for lysine and arginine, respectively.

We previously demonstrated that quiescent HSCs exhibit heterogeneity in intracellular calcium; however the mechanisms that establish this heterogeneity and its physiological relevance remain unclear. Here, we identify phospholipase C like 1 (Plcl1), a non-catalytic protein that binds inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP), as being specifically enriched in the most quiescent HSC subset. Loss-of-function studies demonstrated that, at steady state, Plcl1 deficiency lowers basal intracellular calcium and shifts the HSC compartment toward CD41 subsets, while preserving overall HSC numbers and long-term reconstitution capacity. Under acute hematopoietic stress, Plcl1 loss accelerated and amplified platelet rebound and expansion of non-canonical megakaryocyte progenitors (ncMkPs), suggestive of activation of the thrombopoietic bypass pathway. In aging HSCs, Plcl1 deficiency exacerbated hallmark features, such as expansion of the phenotypic HSC pool, accumulation of CD41 HSCs and ncMkPs, and myeloid-skewed differentiation with impaired competitive reconstitution. These alterations were accompanied by reduced induction of calcium-responsive immediate-early genes. Collectively, these findings identify Plcl1 as an intrinsic regulator that stabilizes cytosolic calcium dynamics in HSCs, thereby restraining stress- and aging-associated megakaryocytic priming and preserving HSC function.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we established highly efficient comparative airway organoids with minimal components from a panel of mammalian species for long-term culture and passaging and validated their utility to predict the transmissibility of zoonotic pathogens. Airway organoids from each species recapitulated the airway histology and contained the major cell types in the airway. They recapitulated the known susceptibility of their host species and tissues to diverse viruses. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that organoids from susceptible species induced genes of anti-viral immune responses only in common upon exposure to the same virus, although each species organoids displayed differential gene expression profiles. Also, organoids of the same species displayed differential transcriptomic responses against different viruses but induced anti-viral immune genes only in common.

P.; Inaba, M.", "abstract": "Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs) reside at the testis tip, surrounding a cluster of niche cells known as the hub. Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligands secreted from the hub exert both contact-dependent and -independent effects. In close proximity to the niche, BMP signaling maintains stem cells by suppressing transcription of the key differentiation factor Bag of Marbles (Bam). In contrast, the diffusible fraction of BMP promotes differentiation of cells by activating bam. How a single signaling pathway produces such opposing outcomes has remained unclear. Here, we show that the diffusible BMP fraction induces bam transcription by repressing the transcriptional repressor Brinker (Brk). We further found that brk mRNA displays a highly heterogeneous expression pattern within interconnected spermatogonial cysts, suggesting that Brk may prime cell fate in a subset of transit-amplifying cells, helping to preserve a population poised for dedifferentiation while maintaining other cells for differentiation. Our findings propose a model in which a single niche-derived factor modulates reciprocal outcomes inside versus outside the niche, which is essential for the tissue homeostasis. Given the broad use of BMP signaling across stem cell niches, this mechanism may represent a general strategy to ensure correct balance between self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We sampled the substrate of imported container-grown plants in several garden centres in Hungary to answer the following questions: (i) What species seeds are present in the substrate of imported garden plants and in what quantity? (ii) Do the substrates of plants imported from different countries contain seeds in different density and composition? (iii) Do characteristics of the host garden plants affect the number and diversity of seeds found in their substrate? We detected altogether 2,181 seeds of 80 taxa in the substrates. On average, 1 litre of substrate contained 36 seeds of five species. Most species were alien in Hungary and considered invasive in Europe. The majority of samples contained at least one seed of a species invasive in Europe. We found that the substrate of plants imported from different countries contained seeds in different number, diversity, and composition. Thus, the structure of the horticultural trade network can shape the alien flora of importing countries. Furthermore, the substrate of needle-leaved ornamental species contained more seeds than the substrate of broad-leaved ornamentals. Our findings demonstrate that the ornamental plant trade can disperse a large number of seeds of numerous species and introduce alien species into the importing countries. We conclude that this introduction pathway deserves greater attention in invasion biology and more studies of this phenomenon are urgently needed.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, significant knowledge gaps persist in characterizing pan-taxonomic microbial richness and sharing dynamics, particularly regarding ecologically critical yet understudied Eulipotyphla (true insectivores). Here we take a macroecological approach to compare how microbial hosting and transmission differ across insectivores, rodents, and bats, and what ecological factors drive such disparities. We find that insectivores host comparable microbial richness to rodents and bats while exhibiting superior intra- and cross-order transmission efficiency. Urban adaptation, geographic range area, and longevity are shared drivers of microbial richness and transmission across these host orders, while greater body mass and shorter gestation time specifically are positive predictors of these outcomes within insectivores. Climate change projections identify insectivores as primary transmission hosts in new high-latitude hotspots by 2035, including parts of the US, Canada, and Russia, posing greater zoonotic threats than rodents or bats. Our findings challenge the prevailing paradigm that prioritizes rodents and bats as special zoonotic reservoirs, establishing insectivores as critical but overlooked players in disease ecology. Collective proactive surveillance of insectivores, rodents, and bats is imperative for forecasting emerging zoonotic threats and informing global risk assessment frameworks.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Some of the most promising antigen targets for antibacterial mAbs are surface polysaccharides such as O-antigen, a component of the lipopolysaccharide found on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. However, developing mAbs against bacterial surface polysaccharides with sufficient breadth and potency to be clinically viable is difficult in part because antibodies against polysaccharides are generally low affinity, and the challenging biochemistry of polysaccharides often precludes further affinity maturation of mAbs against these targets in vitro. Here, we use a phage display library and a whole-cell in-solution panning strategy to successfully improve the affinity of a mAb against Shigella flexneri 3a O-antigen (O-Ag) in vitro without requiring the purification of the target antigen. We demonstrate that a single mutation can improve apparent affinity approximately 10-fold without detectably increasing polyreactivity, and increased affinity correlates with enhanced potency in antibacterial effector function and anti-virulence assays. In addition, the most potent variants also gained increased breadth, successfully coordinating complement deposition and complement-independent opsonophagocytosis against S. flexneri 3b, a serotype weakly recognized by the parent mAb. Altogether, this work represents an important first step towards expanding the antibody engineering toolkit for bacterial surface polysaccharides, which will aid the development of novel mAb therapeutics against AMR bacterial pathogens.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Systematic screening of multiple sialic acid derivatives identifies PSA as uniquely effective in inducing anti-inflammatory polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Based on these findings, an injectable microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffold presenting PSA covalently via its reducing end (MAP-PSA) is engineered, recapitulating physiological glycan orientation. MAP-PSA exhibits robust mechanical properties, stable glycan immobilization, and resistance to enzymatic degradation. Using ischemic stroke as a CNS injury model, MAP-PSA significantly reduces neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory activation while enhancing reparative macrophage and microglial phenotypes. These immunomodulatory effects persist into subacute stages, characterized by sustained reductions in inflammation and enhanced microglial homeostasis.

Given the immense number of possible interactions in microbial communities, their experimental characterization is best guided by testable hypotheses generated through computational predictions.

Bridging this gap will require methods that utilize microbial activity data to infer putative target pathways for experimental validation. In this study, we explored approaches applying cross-species co-expression to predict interactions from microbial co-culture RNA-sequencing data. Specifically, we investigated the extent to which co-expression between genes and pathways of different bacterial species can predict competition, cross-feeding, and specialized metabolic interactions. Our analysis of the Mucin and Diet-based Minimal Microbiome (MDb-MM) data yielded results consistent with previous findings and demonstrated the methods potential to identify pathways that are subject to resource competition. Our analysis of the Hitchhikers of the Rhizosphere (THOR) data showed links between related specialized functions, for instance, between antibiotic and multidrug efflux system expression. Additionally, siderophore co-expression and further evidence suggested that increased siderophore production of the Pseudomonas koreensis koreenceine BGC deletion-mutant drives siderophore production in the other community members.

Robust preclinical models that recapitulate major clinical features of DMD are required to investigate efficacy of potential DMD therapeutics. Rat models of DMD have emerged as promising small animal models to accomplish this; however, there have been no comprehensive studies investigating the functional skeletal muscle decrements associated with the modeling of DMD in rats. Methods- CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to generate a dystrophin-deficient Sprague-Dawley muscular dystrophy rat (MDR). Biochemical and immunofluorescent analyses were performed to confirm loss of dystrophin in striated muscles of this rat model. In situ and ex vivo muscle function was assessed in wild-type (WT) and MDR muscles at 3, 6, and 12 months of age, followed by histopathological analyses. Results- MDR muscle tissues exhibited loss of full-length dystrophin and reduced content of other dystrophin glycoprotein complex members. MDR extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles and diaphragms displayed pronounced and progressive muscle weakness beginning at 3 months of age, compared to WT littermates. EDLs also exhibit susceptibility to eccentric contraction-induced damage. Functional deficits in soleus muscles were less severe and were associated with a right shift in force-frequency relationship and a muscle fiber-type shift. MDR muscles display progressive histopathology including degenerative lesions, fibrosis, regenerative foci, and modest adipose deposition.

We investigated whether human pluripotent stem cell-derived MNs form PNN-like structures in vitro, and whether ALS-associated mutations alter this process. We show that MNs generate PNN-like structures containing hyaluronan, tenascin-R, and aggrecan and that their formation and gene expression were not altered by ALS mutations. To explore whether PNN dysregulation reflects contributions from other cell types or selective MN vulnerability, we conducted meta-analyses of transcriptomic datasets from pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes carrying ALS-associated mutations, as well as datasets comparing MN populations with differential susceptibility to ALS. These analyses revealed no consistent differences in PNN-related gene expression in human stem cell-derived MN. In contrast, transcriptomic analyses of human post-mortem ALS tissues revealed significant dysregulation of PNN-related genes, including core PNN components and linker proteins.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone does not completely reverse this immune exhaustion, and its combination with blockade of immune checkpoint receptors such as TIGIT and KLRG1 could be a promising strategy to promote viral control of viral replication in PWH. However, the impact of targeting these two immune checkpoint receptors has not been evaluated in vivo. In this study, we used a humanized Bone Marrow, Liver and Thymus (hBLT) mouse model of HIV-1 infection to study the impact of oral ART in combination with intraperitoneal injection of either human IgG1 isotypic control or aTIGIT or aKLRG1 or a bispecific aTIGIT/aKLRG1 mAbs. Our results indicated that combination of ART with either aTIGIT or aKLRG1 mAbs led to faster reduction of HIV-1 pVL compared to the Isotype mAb group. Furthermore, viral rebound after antiretroviral treatment interruption (ATI) was delayed in mice treated with aTIGIT and aKLRG1 mAbs. Histological detection of HIV-1 p24 in the spleen was significantly associated with rebound pVL post-ATI. Infected cells in tissue were restricted to the white pulp in the aKLRG1 mAb-treated group, which correlated with higher infiltration of IFNg+ CD8+ T cells in these histological regions and with increased cytotoxic CD107a+ Granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells in the spleen. In contrast, control of HIV-1 replication induced by the aTIGIT mAb was associated with an increased splenic CD107a+ IFNg+ NKG2C+ CD57- adaptive NK cell precursors, which correlated with an earlier maintenance of adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells in the blood after ART initiation. In contrast, combination of ART with a bispecific aTIGIT/aKLRG1 mAb was unable to efficiently suppress viral replication and did not delay viral rebound after ATI, potentially by inducing apoptosis of adaptive NKG2C+ NK and promoting CD8+ T cell hyperactivation. Together, these results suggest that combination of ART with individual TIGIT or KLRG1 blockade may be a promising immunotherapy strategy against HIV-1 by eliciting differential immune control mechanisms.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

M.; Tiede, A.; Abeln, M.", "abstract": "During early pregnancy, maternal blood surrounds the embryo before the placenta is fully developed, requiring tight regulation of maternal blood flow into the placental vasculature. We identify placental microthrombi (PMTs) as essential structures guiding this process. PMTs contain platelets, coagulation factors, and complement proteins, and their formation depends on maternal platelet activation by thrombin through the protease-activated receptor PAR4. Deficiency of PAR4 abolished PMTs and caused excessive bleeding at the implantation site. C3 deficiency also led to increased bleeding events, indicating that complement activation contributes to thrombosis in the placental circulation. Conversely, dysregulated complement activation in CMP-sialic acid synthase-deficient (Cmas-/-) mice led to widespread thrombosis and failed placental development. Strikingly, platelet activation via PAR4 was necessary to localize complement activation to trophoblast surfaces, thereby coupling coagulation and complement in PMT formation. Depletion of maternal platelets mitigated complement-driven thromboinflammation in Cmas-/- pregnancies, restoring placental growth. These findings uncover a critical cooperation between platelets, coagulation, and complement in establishing maternal blood flow to the placenta. Successful pregnancy therefore requires not only activation but also tight regulation of these systems to balance necessary PMT formation with the prevention of pathological thrombosis.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Clinical trials aimed at purging these viral reservoirs with latency reversal agents (LRAs) have been unsuccessful owing to our incomplete understanding of the molecular and physiological determinants that underlie latency reversal in these virus-harboring tissues. Here, using a combination of complementary pharmacological and metabolomic approaches, we uncover glucose as a conditionally essential nutrient for HIV-1 latency reversal at hypoxic conditions. By modelling physiological variations in both glucose and oxygen availability as found in vivo within tissues that may harbor the HIV reservoir, we show that hyperglycemic conditions potentiate HIV-1 latency reversal. Importantly, we found major classes of clinically relevant LRAs, PKC agonists (PKCags) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have disparate efficacies under glucose-limiting conditions. Mechanistically, we show that this differential glycolytic dependency is due to distinct capacities of LRAs to induce glycolytic flux during adaptation to hypoxia, a condition that increases glycolytic dependence. Furthermore, we show that PKCag-induced glycolysis drives histone lactylation, a post-translational modification (PTM) we found to be associated with HIV-1 latency reversal and promotes increased chromatin accessibility at the HIV promoter. Importantly, we identify KAT2A as a lactyl-transferase critical for histone lactylation induced upon latency reversal. Taken together, our findings uncover glucose and oxygen availability as critical metabolic determinants of HIV-1 latency reversal and underscore the importance of modeling physiologically relevant experimental conditions in vitro aimed at identifying therapeutic agents that effectively target the latent reservoir in vivo.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Previously, it was shown that virus-specific Th1 cells arising in acute infections expressed T-bet at distinct intensities and maintained their T-bet expression differences after viral clearance as memory cells for weeks in the steady state. However, it was unclear whether differential T-bet expression was associated with heterogeneity inside the Th1 population and if the quantitative T-bet memory, particularly of those cells expressing T-bet at low levels, could withhold the strong and continuous stimulation present during chronic infection. Using T-bet-ZsGreen reporter mice, virus-specific Th1 cells were characterized phenotypically at protein, RNA, and DNA/chromatin accessibility levels. The Th1 cells arising during acute LCMV Armstrong infection showed a continuous spectrum of T-bet expression, ranging from cells with very high T-bet to cells with low T-bet. Even though the cells with low T-bet expression clearly possessed Th1 characteristics, they additionally showed certain Tfh-like features at protein and RNA level. When virus-specific Th1 cells were sorted according to T-bet-ZsGreen reporter expression intensity, adoptively transferred, and rechallenged by infecting the host animals with the chronic Clone 13 strain of LCMV, they maintained quantitative differences in T-bet reporter and IFN-{gamma} expression levels. A subpopulation of the progeny of the former T-betlow cells still showed a mild Tfh-associated phenotype. Independent of their past and present T-bet expression level, all virus-reactive CD4+ T cells acquired phenotypic signs of exhaustion as characterized by upregulation of PD-1, LAG3, and TOX and vast absence of effector cytokine co-expression in the chronic infection environment. Collectively, our findings highlight the heterogeneity of T-bet+ antiviral CD4+ T cells and the stability of quantitative differences in individual virus-specific CD4+ T cells during chronic viral challenge infection.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

FASL and TGF{beta} are key mediators of T cell dysfunction in the TME and overexpressing dominant negative (dn) forms of their receptors in T cells increases anti-tumor efficacy in solid tumor models. However, an approach which directly targets the endogenous genes would be more amenable to multiplex editing and reduce competition with WT alleles. Here, we employ base editing (BE) in primary human T cells to install naturally occurring dominant negative FAS and TGF{beta}R2 mutations. In vitro survival and proliferation assays demonstrate that BE T cells are resistant to pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects of FAS and TGF{beta} signaling. CAR-T cells with BE-installed dn TGF{beta}R2 or dn FAS exhibit improvements in cytotoxicity, while dn TGF{beta}R2 CAR T demonstrate increased persistence and reduced expression of phenotypic markers of exhaustion compared to controls. Moreover, BE-engineered dn CAR T outperform lentiviral-engineered cDNA over expression counterparts in several functional assays.

C.; Hino, K.; La Torre, A.; Simo, S.", "abstract": "Throughout the central nervous system, the fate and migration of projection neurons are tightly coordinated to ensure that specific neuronal fates settle in precise spatial locations. This is particularly evident in the mammalian neocortex, where early-born projection neurons predominantly remain in the deeper layers of the cortical plate, whereas later-born neurons localize more superficially. However, it remains unclear whether neuronal fate acquisition directly primes the molecular mechanisms driving pyramidal neuron migration and positioning, or on the contrary fate and positioning are regulated independently. MicroRNAs have emerged as key regulators of cell fate determination in the neocortex. Among them, let-7 is known to influence neural progenitor competence and promote the neurogenesis of late-born projection neurons. Here, we show that let-7 also regulates projection neuron migration and positioning by targeting RBX2, a core component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL5, which has been previously shown to inhibit neuron migration by terminating the Reelin/DAB1 signaling pathway. Let-7 directly binds to a conserved motif in the 3' UTR of RBX2, reducing its translation and thereby diminishing CRL5 activity. Importantly, restoring RBX2 levels in the context of let-7 overexpression rescues the positioning of pyramidal neurons without altering let-7-induced effects on neuronal fate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that let-7 enhances pyramidal neuron migration by increasing locomotion speed and prolonging migratory activity. Together, these findings reveal that let-7 coordinates neuronal fate specification and migration via distinct molecular pathways, ensuring the proper laminar positioning of late-born pyramidal neurons in the neocortex.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

R.; Miller, G.; Baillie, P.", "abstract": "Artificial reefs are widely deployed to enhance fish populations, yet their capacity to replicate the ecological roles of natural reef systems remains uncertain, and comparisons are often limited to nearby fringing reefs. Such assessments may overlook how structural features influence ecological outcomes. This study compared fish assemblages across shipwrecks, pelagic pinnacles, and fringing reefs in the Gulf of Thailand to evaluate how artificial structures align with natural patterns of community structure and trophic composition. Natural reef sites were selected to represent contrasting structural profiles, with pinnacles characterized by high vertical relief and fringing reefs by lower-relief slopes. This design enabled assessment of whether high-relief artificial structures, such as shipwrecks, more closely reflect fish communities found on similarly structured natural reefs. Bayesian multivariate models applied to 350 underwater surveys from 14 sites showed that shipwrecks resembled pelagic pinnacles in supporting mesopredators and higher trophic level predators, but had consistently lower representation of grazers and invertivores relative to both natural reef types. These results indicate functional divergence likely driven by reduced benthic complexity and limited forage availability. While shipwrecks may support fisheries species and predator biomass, they do not fully function as ecological analogues of natural reefs.

J.; Pachmann, A.; Bindschedler, S.; Junier, P.; Stanley, C. E.", "abstract": "Soil is a complex system characterised by intra- and inter-kingdom interactions among microbial communities. While many different types of fungal-bacterial interactions have been described, hyphal-mediated transport of bacteria via the so-called fungal highway (FH) has not been mechanistically described. Bacteria require a liquid film for active movement; therefore, liquid saturation is a significant limiting factor for their dispersal in soil. Hyphal networks contribute to the connectivity between discrete soil microbial populations by providing a physical network through the unsaturated soil matrix. This network serves as a scaffold for liquid transport, thus allowing bacteria to migrate further or access previously isolated spaces. Studying these interactions is challenging due to the complex and stochastic nature of the soil environment; this black box aspect makes it difficult to visualise interactions at the microbial scale. Microfluidic technology can provide a solution by offering precise imaging at a high resolution in a physically and chemically controlled environment. We designed a microfluidic device, the Fungal Highways Device (FHD), that allows us to culture filamentous organisms in unsaturated environments and visualise and quantify bacterial dispersal along hyphal networks at the single-cell level. We showed that Pythium ultimum is essential for Pseudomonas putida movement across an unsaturated environment, and we identified mycelial biomass and hyphal front length as key factors influencing the bacteria's movement towards the outlet. We propose that the liquid transport facilitated by P. ultimum mycelium influences the FH behaviour during its interaction with P. putida.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to identify factors influencing donor variability in a two-week long ex vivo NK cell expansion from PBMCs, analyzed across three donors. Single-cell transcriptomics was applied to investigate the distribution of cell types and phenotypes, as well as trajectory inference and differential gene expression. Our results identified that several factors were associated with the variability in the final NK cell fraction and expansion, and that their influence was prevalent between culture day 3 and 8. Compared to high final NK cell fraction, a culture with low final NK cell fraction exhibited an upregulation of some stress and inflammatory genes and an increase in one specific subcluster of the NK cells already on culture day 3. It showed a low score of CD56 Bright CD16- phenotype and high score of CD56Dim CD16+ phenotype. It had also an increased presence of cytotoxic CD8+ Tm cells. Among the observed subclusters of CD8+ Tm cells, it exhibited a higher presence of a subcluster associated with a less differentiated and less cytotoxic phenotype as well as a lower prevalence of a subcluster associated with chemokine and cytotoxic genes. Finally, it had a major expansion of one of the CD8+ Tm cells subclusters annotated as NK-like T cell and characterized by a high CCR5 mRNA expression while the levels of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 mRNA were downregulated. The present findings point towards a potential link between CCL signaling and improved NK cell expansion performance, including possible markers for further investigations, and suggest future strategies to increase the final NK cell fraction and expansion based on donor-specific markers.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

D.; Lupon, E.", "abstract": "Background: Vascularized composite allotransplantation has become a viable reconstructive option for selected patients, but preservation remains a major barrier to broader clinical application. Static cold storage is the current gold standard, yet ischemia reperfusion injury and limited preservation times restrict its effectiveness. Recent advances in machine perfusion and subzero non-freezing storage (or supercooling) have prompted renewed interest in optimizing graft viability. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane, covering studies published from June 2022 through August 2025 for studies on ex vivo preservation of vascularized composite allotransplantations. Eligible articles included original studies in English evaluating postharvest, pretransplant preservation strategies. Data extracted were study design, preservation methods, perfusates, and primary outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using SYRCLE for animal studies and JBI for human/cadaver studies. Results: Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria: one on static cold storage, thirteen on machine perfusion, and three on supercooling. Static cold storage research has declined, with the only recent study investigating sub-normothermic machine perfusion as a recovery adjunct. Machine perfusion studies focused on optimization of perfusion parameters, perfusate composition, and circuit design. Red blood cell-based perfusates remained common, but alternative oxygen carriers such as polymerized hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier-201 and dextran oxygen microcarriers showed promise despite edema-related challenges. Supercooling studies demonstrated feasibility of multi-day preservation in rodent and porcine models. Overall, risk of bias was high or unclear across animal studies, mainly due to selection and performance bias, whereas the single human ex vivo study showed low risk of bias. Conclusions: The field of vascularized composite allograft preservation is expanding rapidly, with machine perfusion and supercooling emerging as the most promising strategies to extend graft viability beyond the limits of static cold storage. However, translation to clinical setting remains limited by small preclinical studies, methodological heterogeneity, and the paucity of functional and immunologic endpoints. Standardized protocols, robust large-animal models, and eventual human feasibility trials are needed to establish clinically applicable preservation strategies.

The most common ARTs involve combinations of drugs targeting viral or cellular proteins. Most of these drugs have to be taken daily. An alternative to ARTs with established inhibitors comprises broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). However, bNAbs share the problem of viral resistance with protein inhibitors. We developed a web service geno2pheno[bNAbs] that allows users to upload viral genotypes and estimates the respective resistance to many common bNAbs. The service uses trained statistical models to classify the virus into sensitive and resistant, respectively or to regress the IC50. Methods: We used two linear models as well as two neural nets for each task and multi-task (MT) learning to train both models for IC50 prediction and classification simultaneously. During multi-task learning we penalize divergence of class and IC50 score in addition to the loss individual to each of the models. Findings: We compared the linear models of geno2pheno[bNAbs] to other state-of-the-art methods like recurrent neural nets and self-attention, and found them to be competitive in regard to accuracy and have the benefit of fast computation and being easily interpretable in regard to features, i.e., positions on the envelope.

Diastolic dysfunction, the hallmark of HFpEF, may arise from impaired active myocardial relaxation, but the contribution of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) handling remains unclear. Methods: We used a validated 'two-hit' murine model of HFpEF, induced by diet-driven obesity and hypertension, to investigate ventricular Ca2+ dynamics. Cardiac function was assessed in vivo by echocardiography, ex vivo in isolated working hearts, and at the cellular level using Fura-2-based Ca2+; imaging of isolated ventricular myocytes. Results: HFpEF mice developed obesity, diastolic dysfunction, hypertrophy, reduced cardiac index, and exercise intolerance despite preserved ejection fraction. Impaired lusitropy was evident in vivo, ex vivo, and at the cellular level, where ventricular myocytes from HFpEF hearts displayed elevated diastolic [Ca2+]i, increased Ca2+ transient amplitudes, and frequency-dependent slowing of Ca2+ clearance (tau), most pronounced at 4 Hz (33% slower vs. controls, p < 0.05). HFpEF myocytes also exhibited an attenuated beta-adrenergic response to isoprenaline, further limiting diastolic reserve. Conclusions: HFpEF is characterised by a distinct ventricular myocyte Ca2+ handling phenotype, diverging from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), with elevated diastolic [Ca2+]i, exaggerated and prolonged Ca2+ transients, and blunted beta-adrenergic modulation. These abnormalities converge to impair lusitropy and exercise tolerance, highlighting altered Ca2+ dynamics as a central mechanism in HFpEF.

Objective: In this study, we aim to describe the voltage offset and ensure that the offset does not alter the intended waveform of applied stimulation. Methods: Using data from 2 human studies and phantom measurements, which employed carbonized rubber electrodes, we quantify the magnitude and frequency of DC-offsets and contrast this against pilot-measurements using Ag/AGCl-electrodes. In a further phantom study, we record the offset-voltage that arises from the electrode/electrolyte interface and compare this to the voltage put out by the stimulation device. Results: A non-zero voltage offset is present in all human and phantom studies employing carbonized rubber electrodes, while the offset using Ag/AgCl electrodes is close to zero. Direct measurements of the stimulator output in the presence of a measurable voltage offset at the stimulation electrodes shows that the offset originates from the electrodes and not from the current provided by the stimulation device. Conclusion: Using carbonized rubber-electrodes for stimulation can result in the emergence of a measurable voltage offset, due to their polarizable nature.

One of these agents is cefiderocol (FDC), a novel siderophore-cephalosporin conjugate antibiotic that was designed to overcome both intrinsic and acquired {beta}-lactam resistance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa. However, studies have demonstrated that inactivation of TonB-dependent receptors, most notably the catechol siderophore receptor piuA can substantially curtail the drug's ability to permeate the bacterial outer membrane, leading to rapid development of resistance. In this study, we examined the FDC resistance mechanisms of the laboratory strain PA14. We demonstrated that inactivation of the ferripyochelin receptor FptA was a first-step mutation towards FDC resistance. Through transposon mutagenesis, we identified several resistance pathways following fptA inactivation, such as the loss of an additional FDC import porin and overexpression of the MuxABC-OpmB multidrug efflux system. Introduction of clinically-identified mutations analogous to these transposon insertions in the absence of fptA conferred full FDC non-susceptibility while preserving the activity of other antipseudomonal {beta}-lactam antibiotics.

P. aeruginosarugose small colony variants (RSCVs), characterized by enhanced biofilm production and resistance, pose significant clinical challenges. However, the formation mechanisms remain unclear in clinical strains. Paired clinical P. aeruginosa isolates AR8023-1 (wild-type) and AR8023-2 (RSCV) were collected from urine samples of a neurosurgery inpatient chronologically. The genome comparison was performed using Breseq, and plasmid complementation was performed to construct complemented strain (AR8023-2RifR::wspAAR8023-1). Then, all the aforementioned strains were examined RSCV phenotype, biofilm formation, and motility, and gene expression differences induced by the wspA mutation were analyzed via transcriptome sequencing, followed by quantification of c-di-GMP. In addition, we assessed antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains under both planktonic and biofilm conditions. The results showed that both AR8023-1 and AR8023-2 were identified as ST3420. AR8023-1 exhibited typical smooth morphology, while AR8023-2 displayed a RSCV phenotype. A single SNP difference was identified between the two strains, characterized by a deletion of glutamine at position 289 (CAG triplet deletion) in the wspA gene of strain AR8023-2. The complement isolates restored wild-type morphology, motility, and biofilm formation. Transcriptomics revealed a significant upregulation of c-di-GMP metabolic genes in RSCVs (P < 0.001), indicating that the WspA{Delta}289Q mutation activates diguanylate cyclase (DGC) activity, thereby elevating c-di-GMP synthesis. Intracellular c-di-GMP levels were significantly higher in RSCVs than those in WT and complement isolates, respectively (P < 0.001). Consequently, biofilm susceptibility testing demonstrated the {beta}-lactams MBIC of RSCVs was [&ge;]8-512-fold higher than those of WT and complement isolates.

As SARS-CoV-2 has become endemic, understanding pulmonary embolism's metabolic effects in COVID-19 patients is warranted. This study investigated the longitudinal metabolic profiles of 66 Intensive Care Unit-admitted COVID-19 patients at Erasmus Medical Center to identify metabolites and mechanisms associated with pulmonary embolism. Method: A total of 1209 metabolic species were measured, including amines and lipids. Metabolic changes were analysed across four timeframes: i) general analysis of pulmonary embolism, ii) 72 hours prior to pulmonary embolism, iii) 48 hours prior and the day of pulmonary embolism, and iv) the day of and 48 hours post-pulmonary embolism. Results: The general analysis revealed significant upregulation of amines, triglycerides, phosphatidylethanolamines, ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines, and eicosanoids in patients who developed a pulmonary embolism. Phosphatidylethanolamines containing the 20:3 fatty acid side chain were notably elevated. Minimal metabolic dysregulation was observed 72 hours before pulmonary embolism, with subtle increases in lysophosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylethanolamines. In contrast, there was a strong metabolic response during and post-pulmonary embolism, phosphatidylethanolamines (47%), ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines(96%) and sphingosines(40%). Conclusion: These findings underscore the critical role of lipid metabolism in pulmonary embolism, particularly triglycerides and specific lipid species. The limited metabolic perturbations before pulmonary embolism suggest early prediction challenges, emphasising the need for further research into temporal metabolic changes and their clinical applications.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Single-cell studies suggest that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells progress along continuous trajectories, but this view conflicts with the existence of discrete, functionally validated populations. Here, we establish the first dynamic, enhancer-based gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) that resolve the molecular programs underlying early human hematopoietic fate decisions. Built on a high-resolution trimodal framework generated with TEA-seq, these networks integrate simultaneously measured transcription factor abundance, enhancer and promoter accessibility, and gene expression within single-cell trajectories anchored to immunophenotypically defined populations. Our framework reveals that stemness loss and lineage acquisition are temporally and mechanistically uncoupled: stemness programs decline gradually through reduced TF abundance long before chromatin closure, whereas lineage identity emerges stepwise through enhancer reconfiguration and activation of lineage-defining eGRNs. This process generates discrete regulatory states that align with immunophenotypically defined populations. Together, these findings reconcile continuous and discrete models of hematopoiesis and establish eGRNs as a powerful framework for defining cell types by their regulatory logic. In addition, we provide an interactive web-based resource to facilitate further investigation of eGRNs and trajectories during early human hematopoiesis.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

An important transition metal-sequestering protein is the S100A8-S100A9 heterotetramer, calprotectin (CP). Prior work reveals that CP induces a significant Zn- and Fe-starvation response in the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii, in liquid culture. Here, we employ a quantitative chemoproteomics platform to pinpoint changes in abundance-corrected cysteine reactivity, and by extension cellular metal occupancy in metalloenzymes, that occur when A. baumannii is challenged with physiological CP in liquid culture relative to an untreated WT control. Changes in protein abundance with CP stress reveal a pronounced Zn-limitation and Fe-starvation response and reciprocal regulation of three enzymes of central carbon metabolism, including aconitase. A majority of the 2645 quantifiable Cys-containing peptides that show an increase in abundance-corrected Cys reactivity (150) are derived from known Zn-, Fe- and Fe-S-cluster proteins, revealing a significant decrease in metal occupancy (undermetalation) across the proteome. Myriad cell processes are compromised by undermetalation of the metalloproteome, including enzymes that function in the TCA cycle and respiration, GTP metabolism, ribosome remodeling, tRNA charging, and proteostasis. A direct comparison of a strain lacking the candidate metallochaperone ZigA ({triangleup}zigA) with the wild-type strain reveals that the loss of ZigA is effectively silent in this assay. We conclude that CP induces a widespread, negative impact on the metalation status of the metalloproteome that results in a significant nutrient limitation response.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

In this work, hyaluronic acid (HA) and kappa-carrageenan ({kappa}-CG) were combined at low polymer concentrations suitable for injectable hydrogel applications and enriched with monovalent (K+), divalent (Ca2+), and trivalent (Al3+) ions to investigate ion-specific contributions to network formation,structure and recovery. FTIR spectroscopy showed that K+ did not produce detectable sulfate or carboxylate shifts, consistent with a predominantly physical mixture and the absence of IPN formation. Ca2+ induced concentration-dependent shifts in both the amide/carboxylate region and the sulfate band, absent at a low concentration but reemerging at higher concentrations, consistent with local chain compaction, complexation of HA carboxylates and bridging between {kappa}-CG helices, indicating promotion of a semi-interpenetrated network structure above a threshold concentration. Al3+ induced a distinct shoulder in the HA carboxylate region, confirming HA coordination and co-crosslinking with {kappa}-CG, yielding a semi-IPN. Microrheology showed progressively stronger local confinement with increasing ion valency corroborating insights from spectroscopy, while recovery tests showed Ca2+ attained the highest recovery potential possibly due to more robust network formation, Al3+ systems displayed moderate recovery but over-screening at high concentrations resulted in network collapse, and K+ systems displayed poor recovery. Importantly, these ion-specific outcomes must be interpreted in the context of combined electrostatic screening effects, which contribute to charge neutralization and polymer chain association independent of coordination chemistry.

We hypothesized that training a deep learning (DL) to differentiate spectrum quality could improve transient averaging compared to traditional averaging. Methods The transient averaging framework was approached through three modules: (1) a continuous-valued automated quality labeling algorithm using both traditional and recently developed MRS quality metrics, (2) a dual-domain (time and frequency) DL model that learns from these quality labels to assess quality scores for new data, and (3) a transient weighting algorithm informed by DL quality scores. The labeling algorithm was used to produce quality labels focused on retaining GABA peak shape in difference spectra (1) to train the DL model (2). The DL model quality scores were used to assign weights (3) for transient pairs within the final average difference spectrum. Results were compared to an existing software weighting algorithm for transient averaging and traditional transient averaging. Results Retaining only GABA-edited transient pairs with quality labels above zero, defined by metrics evaluating peak shapes, resulted in overall better traditional and recently developed mean metric values as well as better visual assessment of GABA and Glx peaks. Applying the trained DL model to in vivo scans, the average difference spectra calculated from the DL quality scores and weighting algorithm resulted in lower fit errors than averaging all transients with equal weights. Conclusion The proposed framework can optimize transient averaging based on quality for edited-MRS.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We used this dataset to develop Modanovo, an extension of the Casanovo transformer architecture for de novo peptide sequencing.

Robustness was confirmed across independent datasets, particularly at peptide lengths frequently represented in the curated dataset.

Short residence times of proteins in the nanopore, high electrical current noise, and bandwidth limitations of the recording electronics during resistive pulse recordings, however, limit the accuracy of size and shape analysis of individual proteins. The work presented here introduces a polymer surface coating of solid-state nanopores to minimize non-specific interactions of proteins with the nanopore wall while functionalizing it covalently with phenylboronic acid (PBA) groups. These PBA groups make it possible to trap selectively glycated proteins by taking advantage of the formation of reversible covalent bonds between PBA and vicinal diol groups of glycated amino acid residues on proteins. Dwell time analysis revealed two populations of resistive pulses: short pulses with dwell times t_d below 0.4 ms from free translocation of proteins and resistive pulses that we term -long events- that last from 0.4 ms to 2 s and result from intended transient covalent bonds between glycated proteins and PBA groups in the nanopore lumen. The choice of applied potential differences during nanopore recordings or the pH value of the recording buffer makes it possible to control and extend the most probable trapping time of proteins in the nanopore within one to two orders of magnitude. This approach provides the highest accuracy for the determination of protein volume and shape achieved to date with solid-state nanopores and reveals that a trapping time of 1 to 20 ms is ideal to achieve reliable volume and shape analysis while retaining high throughput of the analysis.

Passage of macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm depends on the dynamics of the FG-repeat domains and their interactions with nuclear transport receptors. Yet FG-repeat domains are highly aggregation-prone in free solution, forming amyloid-like fibrils at relatively low concentrations. Here we describe an approach to studying the properties of FG-repeat domains (or other polypeptides) when tethered to the walls of pores with diameters similar to those of NPC channels. By attaching alkyl phosphonate groups to the N-termini of 30-residue FG30 peptides that contain four FG repeats, we tether FG30 chains to walls of 20-nm-diameter pores in anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) wafers through phosphonate-surface bonds. Quantitative 13C and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements indicate 90 mM peptide concentrations (300 mg/ml) within the pores. One- and two-dimensional NMR spectra and nuclear spin relaxation measurements show that FG30 chains are dynamically disordered and random-coil-like in buffer-filled pores over a broad temperature range, with no sign of aggregation over many weeks despite the high intrapore concentrations. In contrast, the same FG30 peptide aggregates in free solution at 24 C at concentrations above 2 mM, forming structurally ordered fibrils according to electron microscopy and NMR measurements. These results demonstrate the utility of AAO as a scaffold for studying the properties of FG-repeat domains under conditions that mimic those within NPC channels, show that NMR measurements can elucidate these properties, and suggest that tethering to nanopore walls dramatically alters the self-assembly properties of FG-repeat domains, with potentially important implications for NPC function.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

They were previously thought to belong to Aglaspidida, an extinct group of arthropods from the Cambrian and Ordovician, within Vicissicaudata, a branch of the larger arthropod clade Artiopoda that also includes trilobites. Herein, we used analyses of cephalic outline to quantify whether Zonozoe and Zonoscutum are morphologically more similar to vicissicaudates than other early Palaeozoic arthropods. We assembled a dataset of twenty-six cephalic outlines representing twenty-six early Palaeozoic species, including Zonozoe, Zonoscutum, five euchelicerates, six aglaspidids, three cheloniellids, and a selection of other artiopodans. We quantified their shape using elliptical Fourier analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) place Zonozoe and Zonoscutum within and close to the vicissicaudatan morphospace, clearly distinguishing them from euchelicerates and non-vicissicaudatan artiopodans. These data support the most conservative classification of Zonozoe and Zonoscutum within Artiopoda, while strengthening the case for a more specific affinity with Vicissicaudata, helping to resolve a 150-year-old taxonomic uncertainty.

Standard diet and cholecalciferol supplementation were administered daily for 15 days. At the end of the experimental period, animals were exposed to the behavioural paradigm (open field, Y-maze, and elevated plus maze). Cholecalciferol mitigated CYP-induced anxiogenic behavior. It also significantly improved spatial working memory. The results highlight the ability of cholecalciferol to influence CYP-induced loss in cognition in rats via its anxiolytic, cognitive and immune modulatory properties. They also harness the potential of cholecalciferol as a possible adjunct in cancer chemotherapy. However, further research will be needed to specify its exact role in cancer chemotherapy.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Shear force-induced dissociation of the AGPCR N-terminal fragment (NTF) and C-terminal fragment (CTF) exposes the TA. The decrypted TA binds rapidly to its orthosteric site within the CTF to stabilize the active state of the AGPCR. Corticosteroids were previously proposed to be agonists for GPR97/ADGRG3. Later, other steroids and androgens were purported to be selective agonists of additional AGPCRs. Here, we demonstrate that GPR97/ADGRG3 is activated by dissociation of its NTF/CTF and follows the TA mechanism. TA peptidomimetics and the ADGRG subfamily partial agonist 3-acetoxydihydrodeoxygeduin (3-alpha-DOG), but not corticoids, stimulated GPR97/ADGRG3 in cell-based luciferase reporter assays and receptor/G protein reconstitution assays. GPR97 was defined as a promiscuous AGPCR that couples to G13, Gs and Gi, but not Gq. GPR97 is highly expressed in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (hPMNs). Neutrophils undergo actin polymerization-induced cell shape changes and polarization and migrate upon activation. We found that GPR97 activation via TA peptidomimetics or 3-alpha-DOG robustly stimulated hPMN and mouse bone-marrow neutrophil (mBMN) polarization. Furthermore, GPR97 TA peptidomimetics and 3-alpha-DOG, but not beclomethasone, induced hPMN and mBMN chemotaxis. Together, our results demonstrate that GPR97/ADGRG3 utilizes a tethered agonist mechanism to activate G protein signaling and induce neutrophil polarization and migration.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

These innate capabilities render integrases as powerful biotechnology tools that mediate efficient site-specific integration of large genetic cargos. Given that genomes often lack the integration sites recognized by frequently utilized integrases, integrase technology has largely been restricted to genetic engineering of model organisms into which attB sites can be synthetically introduced. To enable single-step site-specific integrase-mediated genome editing in a broad spectrum of prokaryotes, we have devised the Integrase-On-Demand (IOD) method. IOD systematically identifies integrases, from bacteria and archaea, that can integrate into available attB sites in any target prokaryote. Computational results show that diverse bacteria generally have multiple potentially useable native attB/integrase pairs. We confirmed the functionality of predicted integrase and attB pairs for mediating site-specific genomic integration of heterologous DNA into the genomes of Pseudomonas putida S12 and KT2440 and Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 and measured efficiency of integration using suicide constructs. By eliminating the requirement to introduce non-native attB sites into the target genome, IOD may, when suitable transformation methods exist, allow facile genome integration of large constructs in non-model and possibly non-culturable bacteria.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are short, often cationic, peptide-based molecules with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity, which makes them promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics in poultry production. From a prior machine-learning-guided screen of 875 candidate AMPs, 62 exhibited activity against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) and low in vitro hemolytic and cytotoxic activity. We selected three lead AMPs from this list (named TeRu4, TeBi1, and PeNi4), and evaluated their in vitro and in vivo efficacy, safety, and immunomodulatory potential for use in poultry farming. In animal experiments, AMPs were administered via in ovo injection on day 18 of embryonic development. In APEC challenge trials, yolk sacs were inoculated with APEC post-hatch to assess early chick mortality, while in pen trials, birds were raised in a commercial production setting for 35 days. For challenged birds, TeBi1 (10 g/egg) significantly reduced bacterial detection in the air sac and pericardium, increased body weight by 50% and reduced cytokine transcript levels by 10-30% on day 7 post hatch. In HD11 chicken macrophage-like cultured cells, TeRu4 (16 g/mL) suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine transcript levels. In pen trials, TeRu4 (20 g/egg) increased the survival probability of female birds by 4.9%, while TeBi1 (20 g/egg) increased the survival probability of all birds by 4.4%, by day 35. Gene expression analysis revealed AMP- and sex-specific cytokine responses. In pen trials, no significant differences were observed in mean weights, feed conversion ratio, and flock uniformity on day 35.

While studying interactions is key to understanding microbial communities as a whole, gaining a detailed mechanistic view is challenging due to the scale of co-occurring interactions. The model nutrient approach enables the study of a subset of interactions involving a single nutrient class and can shed light on broader interaction mechanisms involving other nutrients. Here, we focus on cobamides, the cobalamin (vitamin B12) family of enzyme cofactors, to study nutrient competition and nutrient-sharing interactions in co-cultures and tri-cultures. We examined bacteria that were previously isolated from a grassland soil and were characterized as \"dependents\" (require cobamides but cannot synthesize them) or \"producers\" (synthesize cobamides). The outcome of competition between a pair of dependents was predictable based on monoculture growth characteristics, with the dominant microbe determined by its adaptation to a specific cobamide concentration range. Moreover, cobamide producers could support the cobamide-dependent growth of dependents in co-culture and influenced the outcome of competition between dependents in tri-culture. We analyzed the metabolic capacity encoded in the genomes of producers and dependents and found that cobamides are likely the main shared nutrient in our co- and tri-cultures.

Results revealed a dramatic increase in microbial richness and evenness post-treatment, with pronounced taxonomic restructuring: copiotrophic Proteobacteria, dominant in influent streams, declined sharply, while stress-tolerant lineages including Actinobacteriota, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota emerged in effluents. Multivariate analyses (DCA, NMDS, PCoA) confirmed consistent, significant compositional turnovers, with statistically robust separation between input and output communities. Although community diversity and functional metabolic capacity expanded, several clinically relevant genera--Escherichia, Legionella, and Campylobacter--persisted in effluents at non-trivial levels, raising concerns for water reuse safety. Functional profiling highlighted increased metabolic versatility and resilience in treated microbiomes, particularly enrichment in nutrient cycling, xenobiotic degradation, and stress adaptation pathways. Community trajectories were strongly influenced by site-specific physicochemical factors, underscoring the need for tailored surveillance and optimized operation.

We previously characterized the neurovirulence of LACV and closely related Inkoo virus (INKV) and discovered they have opposing neurovirulence phenotypes in mice and human neuronal cells: LACV has high neurovirulence and INKV has low neurovirulence. We therefore generated reassortant viruses between LACV and INKV to map the genome segments that mediate LACV's high neurovirulence phenotype. We recovered all six possible reassortant viruses of the L, M, and S genome segments using coinfection and reverse genetics approaches. We evaluated the neurovirulence of these reassortant viruses in mice in vivo and in human neuronal cells in vitro. Our results show that no single LACV genome segment alone was sufficient to cause wildtype LACV-like neurological disease in mice, and in fact all six reassortant viruses were attenuated from wildtype LACV. We found that the LACV M and S segments together were the primary drivers of neurological disease in mice, whereas the LACV L segment played a minor role. Our in vitro results indicate that the LACV M segment is crucial for efficient replication in neurons, but the LACV L segment appears to mediate slightly more efficient neuronal replication than the INKV L segment. The LACV M and S segments together induced wildtype LACV-like levels of neuronal death, indicating the LACV M and S are the primary mediators of neuronal death, and the L segment is not required.

While a relation between particle exposure and cardiovascular disease has been observed, its role during pregnancy requires further understanding. Herein, we investigated the effect of TiO2 exposure on cardiac tissue in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies using human cardiomyocytes showed TiO2 increased toxicity and necrotic death associated with enhanced oxidative stress. The use of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a general antioxidant, rescued the myocytes from TiO2-induced necrotic death. Pregnant (P) or non-pregnant (NP) mice were challenged with TiO2 to assess the effect of pregnancy and exposure in cardiac tissue. Pregnancy alone was shown to alter the cardiac proteome with upregulation of inflammation biomarkers. Upon exposure, both P and NP mice showed notable proteome remodeling with pathways associated with oxidative stress, cardiac function, cell death, and inflammation being altered. Immunoblots confirmed changes in catalase, Complement (C) 5, and glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1). These findings demonstrate that TiO2 can cause cardiac damage with characteristics similar to those in myocardial infarction and ischemia. Exposure during pregnancy can exacerbate some of these effects.

The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Tropical environments are undergoing intense rates of environmental change, and these changes may be driving large declines in genetic diversity. However, data on genetic diversity are highly skewed towards temperate regions. The degree to which diversity loss has occurred in tropical species, particularly marine species, remains an open and important question. Here, we directly compare genomic data from modern and museum collections of two commercially-harvested nearshore marine fishes (Equulites laterofenestra and Gazza minuta) gathered from a single location in the Philippines, spanning a century of intense environmental change. These data reveal a marked loss in genetic diversity and evidence for multiple orders of magnitude reductions in effective population size (Ne) in both species, indicating substantial genomic erosion. Such a decline highlights the long-lasting genomic consequences of anthropogenic activity and sheds light on an, until-now, invisible loss of diversity from the most biodiverse ocean region.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Although these datasets contain rich information on drug resistance, they are both complex and multivariate, with each isolates susceptibility measured across several antibiotics.

To address this gap, we develop Antimicrobial Resistance Cartography, a set of methods for interpreting high-dimensional drug resistance in large isolate collections. As a proof-of-concept, we analysed 3,628 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from the Active Bacterial Core (ABC) surveillance program, each with MICs measured for six beta-lactam antibiotics. We demonstrate how this toolkit simplifies visualisation of antibiotic resistance data across multiple drugs, resolves common issues such as missing or censored values, and identifies genetic mutations driving correlated resistance changes across multiple antibiotics. We characterise penicillin-binding protein (PBP) substitutions that increase minimum inhibitory concentration to multiple beta-lactam subclasses, revealing subtle differences in their correlated phenotypic effects, and identifying potential constraints on resistance evolution across genetic backgrounds. AMR cartography therefore provides a versatile framework for quantifying and visualising correlated resistance across antibiotics, enhancing the interpretability of complex susceptibility data for both research and public health.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We found that HERC2 also recognizes and binds to similar DxDKDxD motifs within a handful of other proteins relevant to brain development (DOCK10, PCM1, USP35, BAZ2B, ARID4A, ARIP4, RERE and MYT1). We further investigated the interaction of HERC2 with DOCK10, a RAC1- and CDC42-GEF protein that regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons. Both disruption of the HERC2-binding motif in DOCK10 and knockdown of HERC2 affected the GEF activity of DOCK10. We also show that the DOCK10-induced dendritic spine formation is dependent on its ability to bind HERC2. Structural modeling of full-length DOCK10, free or bound to either RLD2, CDC42 or RAC1 indicates that the GEF activation of full-length DOCK10 requires a conformational change that is stimulated by binding to HERC2. Based on our data, we propose that under pathological conditions, in developing brains with an abnormal dosage of either HERC2 or its dominant partner UBE3A, increased or decreased amounts of HERC2/DOCK10 complexes could lead to altered GTPase activation.

This asymmetry can create a stress imbalance, with the two leaflets experiencing opposing tensions, though direct experimental measurement of leaflet stress remains challenging. Such a stress imbalance can compress one leaflet and trigger a fluid-to-gel phase transition, which reduces membrane fluidity and markedly increases bending rigidity. These phenomena raise a key question of how membranes respond mechanically before crossing the transition threshold, a regime that remains relevant to biological functions. Here, we combine extensive all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine how stress asymmetry modulates membrane structure and mechanics near the transition point. Using POPE and DLPC bilayers as model systems, we find that moderate asymmetry induces transient gel-like domains that continuously form and dissolve, amplifying undulations and lowering bilayer rigidity. Beyond the gelation threshold, the trend reverses and the bilayer stiffens, resulting in a non-monotonic dependence of rigidity on asymmetry. Moreover, our results reveal distinct curvature preferences of fluid and gel phases. Extending this analysis to a multicomponent bacterial outer membrane, we demonstrate that stress asymmetry can trigger transient gel-like domain formation even in complex lipid mixtures. This provides a proof of principle that differential stress modulates membrane mechanics by inducing either softening or stiffening, complementing the effects of molecular composition. Our findings elucidate how cells might exploit the stress-curvature-phase coupling to tune membrane rigidity under near-physiological conditions.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

E.; Uddback, I.; Ahmed, H.; Kohlmeier, J.; Antia, R.; Koelle, K.", "abstract": "Viral transmission from infected donors to uninfected recipients is the key event underlying the spread of viral pathogens at the level of a host population. Successful viral transmission from a donor to a recipient depends on several factors including the infectiousness of the donor. Donor infectiousness in turn can depend on the viral kinetics and viral load of the donor, donor behavior and symptoms, and donor immunity. Here, we use a mouse model of murine respirovirus (otherwise known as Sendai virus SeV) infection to quantitatively explore donor determinants of respiratory virus transmission. The experimental transmission studies we analyze are specifically designed to address the effect that pre-existing donor immunity may have on transmission potential by studying SeV transmission from both immunized and control (placebo-immunized) donors to naive recipients. We specifically focus on the impact of tissue resident memory (TRM) CD8 T cells on donor transmission potential by considering immunization strategies that primarily generate CD8 T cell immunity. Through quantitative analyses of these experiments, we find that pre-existing CD8 TRMs act to reduce donor transmission potential. This reduction can be in part explained by a reduction in total infection load in immunized donors. However, even once differences in infection load between immunized and control donors are accounted for, immunized donors still have reduced infectiousness relative to control donors. We explore possible reasons for this unexpected pattern using a mathematical model that integrates within-host viral dynamics and between-host transmission occurrences. Analysis of model simulations, along with observations from knock-out experiments, suggests that interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) may be partly responsible for the observed differences in infectiousness between control and pre-immune donors. Future experimental transmission studies should consider measuring IFN-{gamma} levels when interpreting transmission outcomes in the context of host immunity.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

These pathways are particularly relevant in major pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Increasing evidence highlights the pathogenic potential of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), originally environmental species that are emerging as significant human pathogens. Understanding the evolution of CDN signaling may therefore provide critical insights into this transition. Our comparative genomic analysis revealed that the c-di-AMP synthase disA is present as a single copy in nearly all mycobacterial genomes, except within the genus Mycolicibacter. The corresponding phosphodiesterases, PDE and AtaC, are variably distributed, with pathogenic mycobacteria showing a preference for PDE over AtaC. In contrast to the relatively conserved c-di-AMP system, the c-di-GMP pathway comprising diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs), exhibits remarkable variation in gene presence/absence and domain architecture across the Mycobacteriaceae family. This diversity suggests multiple independent gene gain and loss events throughout evolution, often accompanied by the acquisition of accessory domains. Evolutionary analyses indicate that disA, like core housekeeping genes, is under strong purifying selection, while pde shows relatively low diversity, reinforcing the idea that c-di-AMP signaling is highly conserved and essential across mycobacteria. By contrast, the c-di-GMP system is more heterogeneous, reflecting its role in environmental adaptation. Together, these findings highlight a sharp evolutionary divergence in CDN signaling, where c-di-AMP appears indispensable for core physiology, whereas c-di-GMP provides flexibility for niche-specific adaptation within the Mycobacterium genus.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Phenotypic assays revealed that C. durum strains displayed robust aggregation, thick biofilm formation, and extensive extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) networks, whereas C. argentoratense and C. matruchotii formed thinner biofilms with minimal EPS production.

Our thorough review of past and ongoing citizen science (CS) projects reveals that CS targeting the general public, equipped with smartphones, is increasingly used to amplify the spatial and temporal scale of data collection in biodiversity research.

Using a novel dataset on the evolution of woodiness in angiosperms, we discovered substantially more derived woody species (DWS) and independent evolutionary transitions on continents compared to islands (4,808 species and 513 transitions vs. 1,084 and 175, respectively). However, we identified more insular DWS hotspots (22) than the four continental DWS hotspots: the Andes, Southern Africa, the Old-World Dry Belt and Australia. A structural equation model controlling for total species richness suggests that aridity is the strongest predictor of the number of DWS on continents, while frost-free temperatures best predict DWS on islands. Precipitation seasonality and mean elevation emerge as additional significant predictors in both cases, with a further potential role for light-prone open habitats.

Typical inputs for building prediction models in agriculture include genealogies, molecular markers and phenotypes. Information is seldom complete, i.e., there may be individuals that lack at least one of such inputs. For instance, all individuals may possess pedigree data but only a fraction is genotyped for molecular markers. A solution for such situation is known as \"single-step best linear unbiased prediction\" (SS-BLUP). A more general scenario is one where, in addition to the setting of SS-BLUP, there are subjects with genomic data but lacking genealogy, with or without phenotypes. Our study presents a novel \"single-step\" prediction method that accommodates a wider degree of incompleteness than SS-BLUP. It does not employ imputation or approximations and is based on basic Bayesian principles of combining distinct prior opinions. The proposed method, Hy-BLUP (\"Hy\" for \"hybrid\") uses a prior that combines knowledge from the population about variation derived from pedigree and from markers, as if these two sources of information were independent. Such assumption may overstate prior precision, but Bayesian theory dictates that it should be over-ridden as information from data accrues.The Bayesian logic defines the weights assigned to the sources implictly. However, additional weights (w_{A} and w_{G} for pedigree and genomic information, respectively) may be introduced as tuning parameters. From an inferential perspective, the weights and the variance components are not jointly identified in the likelihood function. However, given the variance components, some Bayesian learning about the weights can be obtained. The prior induces a precision matrix (inverse of the covariance matrix) automatically, without use of cumbersome matrix algebra arguments or approximations. The prior is combined with the data and, given the weights (if any) and variance parameters, the estimating \"mixed model\" equations can be built and computed directly. The method was evaluated using a publicly available data set consisting of 599 inbred lines of wheat genotyped for binary markers and with full pedigree information; the target trait was grain yield. The evaluation used several experiments that simulated various patterns of incompleteness and a training-testing layout supplemented by bootstrapping or random reconstruction of sets. There were minor differences between SS-BLUP and Hy-BLUP in predictive ability.The discussion includes a multiple-trait generalization of Hy-BLUP that may be useful in situations where some individuals are not phenotyped for some trait (e.g., animal carcass weight in a fully-pedigreed breeding nucleus) while others (not pedigreed) are genotyped, scored and destroyed for commercial or laboratory purposes. The study provides a proof-of-concept of the potential usefulness of Hy-BLUP for routine genome-enabled prediction in individuals with irregular patterns of information. *Corresponding author: gianola@ansci.wisc.edu", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to perform an integrated bioinformatic analysis of C-MYC and its associated pathways in a cohort of GAC patients to delineate its expression profile, assess its potential as a biomarker, and correlate its patterns with clinicopathological factors such as Lauren classification and neoadjuvant treatment status. Methods: The study included transcriptome data from 74 GAC tumor samples and 68 normal gastric tissue samples. Following RNA sequencing, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis was conducted on a curated list of 21 C-MYC-associated genes. The methodology included differential expression analysis (DESeq2), unsupervised hierarchical clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate diagnostic performance. Gene expression levels were also statistically correlated with Lauren histological subtypes and neoadjuvant therapy status using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results: The analysis revealed a profound dysregulation of the C-MYC network in GAC. While MYC itself was significantly upregulated, its transcriptional antagonists, particularly MXD4 and MXD3, were the most significantly downregulated genes. This gene signature robustly separated tumor from normal tissues in both hierarchical clustering and PCA. ROC analysis demonstrated the outstanding diagnostic potential of several genes, with MXD4 achieving a perfect Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 1.00, surpassing the diagnostic value of MYC (AUC=0.86). Stratification by Lauren classification showed that MYC and its stability regulator PTBP1 were significantly more expressed in the intestinal subtype, whereas the repressors MXD3 and MXI1 were higher in the diffuse subtype. No significant expression differences were observed based on neoadjuvant treatment status. Conclusion: Gastric adenocarcinoma is characterized by a coordinated dysregulation of the C-MYC network, marked by both oncogene activation and a concurrent loss of its key transcriptional repressors.

M.; Johnsson, M.", "abstract": "Large-effect recessive damaging variants found at relatively high frequencies are common enough in domestic animals that they cause problems in breeding programs. There are several potential reasons. Deleterious variants may rise in frequency because of genetic drift, be driven to intermediate frequency by balancing selection by heterozygote advantage, or be spread by exceptionally influential parents, usually sires, that sometimes occur in animal breeding programs. Further, animal populations are often connected by migration. In this paper, we use a series of population genetic models to address how large-effect damaging alleles establish themselves in small populations, such as domestic animal populations or wild populations of mammals. The results confirm that a lethal allele under directional selection is fairly unlikely to become common, unless there are influential sire events with very large contributions or the population size is very small. On the other hand, a lethal allele under balancing selection can easily become common, especially if there are influential parents. When there is balancing selection, migration between connected populations effectively spreads alleles. The results accord with the many examples of recessive damaging alleles in domestic animals.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

A critical barrier to intervention has been the lack of molecular insights into viral entry, particularly the interaction between the HAstV capsid spike and its receptor, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Here, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the HAstV spike from classical serotypes 2 and 6 in complex with human FcRn, defining the conserved receptor-binding interface at atomic resolution. These structures reveal serotype-specific variations dictating receptor affinity and that reported neutralizing antibodies inhibit infection primarily by sterically blocking the receptor-binding site. Mapping conserved epitopes across classical HAstV serotypes provides a blueprint for design of broad-spectrum antivirals that disrupt viral entry.

The enteric CheY RRs, that represent the chemotaxis subfamily, have been extensively characterized. Their native, chemical or genetically altered crystal structures have revealed an essential role in activation for water-mediated hydrogen bonds (H-bond). Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) to compare the protein-water H-bond network in basal and in-silico phosphorylated configurations. We supplement the MD with energy frustration profiles to screen atomic structures and models from selected representatives of the RR superfamily. The energetically frustrated phosphorylation pocket consists of the conserved aspartate triad for phosphorylation plus associated structural waters and residues for Mg2+ ion coordination. It is the central community node in the H-bond network characterized here in atomic detail. The network has a stable core and plastic nodes switching bonding states due to loop flexibility and sidechain rotations. The H-bond transitions are coupled to the long-range dynamic networks, extracted by mutual information. The pocket is connected to the target binding surface by a water mediated seam anchored by the conserved T87 and K109 residues. Analysis of two other RRs suggests that water-mediated H-bonds in the phosphorylation pocket and relay are a generic feature of RR allosteric information transfer. The water contribution may provide a critical metric for the design of allosteric inhibitors based on the difference between RR sub-families.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Although light influences cuticle formation, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly in fruits. Here, we show that fruits from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants grown under far-red-enriched light conditions displayed increased cuticle load due to the up-regulation of cutin and wax biosynthetic genes. Both tomato PHYB-encoding genes (SlPHYB1 and SlPHYB2) were implicated as negative regulators of fruit cuticle formation, as revealed by the thinner cuticles, reduced abundance of cutin monomers and cuticular waxes, and downregulation of cuticle-related genes detected in fruits from transgenic plants overexpressing constitutively active alleles of SlPHYB1/B2 (SlYHB1OE and SlYHB2OE). The impaired cuticle of SlYHB1/B2OE fruits resulted in increased susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea, despite their markedly enhanced flavonoid accumulation in the peel. PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (SlPIF3, SlPIF4) and the B-box protein SlBBX28 were identified as downstream factors of SlPHYB1/B2-mediated regulation of cuticle deposition, synergistically activating the expression of cuticle-related genes. Additionally, SlPHYB1/B2 signaling also downregulated multiple central carbon metabolism-related genes in the fruit peel, likely reducing the pool of activated fatty acids (FAs) feeding into cutin and wax biosynthetic pathways.

However, the initial infection events in the oral cavity, including how HCMV modulates oral cells to establish infection and spread, are supported by limited experimental data and therefore remain poorly understood. We investigated HCMV infection in cultures of primary human oral keratinocytes (HOKs) as a model to study HCMV infection in the oral mucosa using the TB40E-Gfp and MOLD strains of HCMV. Both viral strains successfully infected and replicated in HOKs as demonstrated by the appearance of cytopathic effects, full expression of viral transcripts, and the shedding of infectious virus. To investigate how HCMV modulates the transcriptome of primary HOKs, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) which revealed 11 subtypes of cells. Furthermore, infection resulted in significant changes in host gene expression. HCMV upregulated genes involved in immune responses, cell cycle regulation, cancer-related pathways, neuronal and synaptic functions, metabolism, stress responses, molecular chaperones, and vesicular trafficking which might be critical for viral protein expression and assembly. HCMV also increased the expression of genes related to the extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, microtubules, signal transduction, kinases, and transcriptional regulation. Conversely, HCMV downregulated genes associated with inflammation and immune responses, cell cycle control and apoptosis, cell adhesion and migration, as well as signaling pathways, growth factors, ion channels, transporters, and transcription factors when compared to uninfected cells. These findings suggest that HCMV modulates a wide range of host cellular pathways to create a favorable environment for its replication. HCMV also induced changes in HOK differentiation genes downregulating basal state genes and upregulating intermediate genes and select terminal differentiation genes, indicating HCMV might be driving HOK differentiation towards a dysregulated intermediate phenotype while inhibiting their terminal differentiation to maintain a cell state capable of sustaining viral replication. Using SciViewer, our recently developed scRNA-seq data visualization tool, we determined that as the infection progressed from low to high viral transcript accumulation, HCMV infection upregulated E2F targeted genes, some antiviral and immune responses as well as autophagy and cellular stress responses, while downregulating interferon-stimulated genes, immune and antiviral response genes, pyroptosis, inflammatory cell death, and membrane remodeling and viral entry genes. Overall, our study shows that primary human HOKs can be used as a model to study HCMV infection in the oral mucosa and that HCMV drives dysregulated intermediate oral keratinocyte differentiation and altered immune responses which likely facilitate viral replication in the oral mucosa and spread into the rest of the host.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

H.; Ghelich, R.; Schmidlin, K.; Kinsler, G.; Geiler-Samerotte, K.", "abstract": "Understanding which phenotypic effects of mutation impact fitness is a central question in evolutionary biology. Yet genotype-phenotype relationships are not bipartite; a single mutation can influence hundreds of molecular-level phenotypes. This complexity poses a major challenge for predicting evolutionary outcomes, such as the relative fitness advantage of one mutant over another. Despite this, genotype-fitness relationships can sometimes be approximated by low-dimensional models that predict the fitness of diverse mutants in novel environments. But are these successes idiosyncratic to a few datasets, or do they reveal general features of genotype-phenotype maps? Here, we highlight the generality of this result and its limits in the context of drug resistance. We apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to a dataset of ~800 yeast mutants evolved in various concentrations and combinations of antifungals. This analysis identifies a small number of phenotypic dimensions that predict mutant fitness with up to 70% accuracy in unseen drug combinations. Predictive power plateaus rapidly with the addition of new training environments or model components, indicating that low dimensionality is not an artifact of sampling, but instead represents the funneling of mutational effects through a small number of major phenotypic axes. Our results support longstanding ideas that modularity and canalization constrain phenotypic variation, making evolutionary outcomes more predictable. Beyond modularity, our dataset also sheds light on pleiotropy. Unlike other systems where mutations affect only a subset of dimensions, we find that most mutations perturb most inferred phenotypic axes. This lack of sparsity suggests that drug environments may provoke unusually pleiotropic responses, perhaps because cells rarely encounter these stresses in nature. Natural environments, such as nutrient limitation, may instead reveal a sparser wiring where mutations act through more specific phenotypic routes. Finally, our results highlight that low-dimensional linear models do not capture everything: some drug combinations remain difficult to predict. In these environments, subsets of mutants often show nonmonotonic fitness responses to increasing drug concentrations, and their prediction accuracy does not improve simply by adding more training data. These limitations highlight the need for nonlinear approaches and models that integrate high-dimensional phenotypic measurements to fully uncover how mutations shape cellular processes and fitness.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

The molecular details of this evolution remain puzzling. In this work, we determine crystal structures and explore dynamical behavior of a bifunctional ancestral ABH-fold enzyme, highlighting molecular features associated with the transition from hydrolytic to oxygenolytic catalysis at this fold. Structures showed a canonical ABH-sandwich shielded with a helical cap domain. The catalytic pocket is voluminous enough to accommodate a bulky substrate. Molecular docking showed productive binding of the coelenterazine substrate, as well as the product coelenteramide. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the coelenterazine entry does not present a major energetic barrier and identified a preferred binding orientation important for oxygenolytic catalysis. Comparisons between ancestral and extant enzymes highlighted specific amino acids and sequence motifs characteristic for oxygenolytic luciferases.

Some mutations increase the fitness of their lineage and compete with each other in a process known as clonal interference. Other mutations can evade competitive exclusion by diversifying into distinct ecological niches. Both processes are frequently observed in natural and experimental settings, yet little is known about how they interact in the parameter regimes most relevant for microbes. Here we address this gap by analyzing the dynamics of ecological diversification in a simple class of resource competition models, where individuals acquire mutations that alter their resource uptake rates. We focus on large adapting populations, where mutations occur so frequently that their ecological and evolutionary timescales overlap. In this regime, we show that the competition between linked mutations causes the population to self-organize into a smaller number of distinct ecotypes, driven by an emergent priority effect that favors the resident strains. We demonstrate that these priority effects bias the long-term metabolic structure of the population, producing qualitative departures from existing ecological theory. We argue that similar dynamics should arise for other rapidly evolving ecosystems, where adaptive mutations accumulate at many linked genetic loci.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

We investigated reciprocal interactions between tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and a non- vector spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in coinfections on tomato plants. We compared the number of T. urticae emerging as adults and the virus titre of two TSWV isolates (France81 and LYE1137vir) quantified by DAS-ELISA in single and coinfections. We also measured host plant traits including height, fresh weight, chlorophyll content, and the number of flowers in both single and coinfection treatments and in uninfected control plants. Plant height, weight and number of flowers were lower for France81-infected plants than for LYE1137vir-infected and uninfected plants. This strain that was more virulent also had overall higher viral loads, but there was no direct link between viral load and host traits. We found that the most virulent TSWV isolate (France81) facilitated spider mites by increasing the number of offspring per unit of plant height. In contrast, there was no effect of T. urticae on the load of either TSWV isolate. T. urticae did however reduce plant height, thus in coinfection there was an additive effect of virulence compared to singly infected plants. Although we do not find that T. urticae impacts TSWV titre in coinfection, our results do indicate that coinfection could negatively impact both isolates via effects on virulence. Coinfection with the most virulent isolate may accelerate host death due to elevated T. urticae growth on relatively smaller plants. In addition, for both viral isolates, further reductions in plant height in coinfection, may also in time lead to increased T. urticae competition for plant resources and earlier plant death. Our results indicate the importance of simultaneously exploring the life-history traits of both parasites and the host, in single and co-infections, to get a proper idea of both potential direct and indirect effects between all players. Importantly, parasite fitness may be severely reduced via indirect effects of coinfection mediated via impacts on host virulence if the host dies sooner than in single infections.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Brown algae are complex multicellular eukaryotes that provide a unique perspective on chromatin evolution given their independent origin of complex multicellularity. Here, we compile the chromatin toolkit of brown algae and show that canonical silencing systems involving DNA cytosine methylation and PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation were lost early in their evolution. By generating hPTM profiles from diverse brown algal clades, we resolve the nature and regulatory roles of chromatin states in this lineage and show how H3K79 methylation emerged and diversified as a repressive system. We further uncover sex-specific reconfigurations in species with varying degrees of sexual dimorphism and reconstruct the ancestral regulatory landscape that likely preceded the emergence of brown algae.

Demographic modelling suggests that the initial contact between the two species in Europe occurred ~800,000 years ago, indicating sympatry in that region since the Middle Pleistocene. In North America, their contact likely happened within the last centuries and was potentially driven by the human-mediated dispersal of T. angustifolia. We identified 47 candidate barrier loci between species in Europe, 6 of which are associated with reproductive functions. No barrier loci were found in North America.

This motivates the development of computational approaches that can accurately infer responses to unmeasured perturbations from related experimental data. We introduce dbDiffusion, a generative framework that integrates diffusion models with classifier-free guidance derived from perturbation information, operating in latent space through a variational autoencoder (VAE). Diffusion models are probabilistic generative models that approximate data distributions by reversing a Markovian diffusion process, progressively denoising Gaussian noise into structured outputs. By exploiting biological similarities in gene expression profiles and relationships among perturbations, dbDiffusion enables the conditional generation of gene expressions for previously unobserved perturbations. In contrast to competing approaches, dbDiffusion does not rely on LLM or foundation models, which have been found to yield unsatisfactory results. Rather, it leverages embeddings derived from measured perturbations to generalize to unseen perturbations, effectively transferring information across related experimental conditions. In benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods on Perturb-seq datasets, dbDiffusion demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting perturbation responses. A methodological innovation of dbDiffusion is the integration of prediction-powered inference, which corrects for biases inherent in generative models and enables statistically rigorous downstream tasks, including identification of differentially expressed genes.

Although limited zoonotic cases have resulted from the current epizootic outbreak, the wide diversity of influenza viruses in avian hosts means the emergence of new strains that could transmit to humans more readily cannot be ruled out. There is therefore a need to anticipate zoonotic potential before spillover occurs. Here, we develop a novel zoonotic prediction model for avian influenza viruses, building upon \"host-predictor\" machine learning methods that estimate host potential given only a viral genome sequence. We construct a machine learning framework combining individual sub-models of influenza genome segments, each trained on many genomic and proteomic traits (e.g., k-mer composition, codon biases, protein physicochemistry). To prevent over-fitting to heavily sampled lineages and ensure models generalise to phylogenetically distant viruses, we pre-process training data by considering clusters of shared sequence identity. Curated training sets cover ~4,000 representative, complete genome sequences of avian influenza from 120 subtypes including 9 containing known zoonotic viruses. We combine best-performing models into a single ensemble that can distinguish zoonotic capability of sequences held out from training with strong performance (AUROC = 0.95, F1 score = 0.90), including sequences of rarely-sampled subtypes, e.g., H10N8. Interrogating ensemble model decisions also allows us to identify influential genomic motifs most associated with human infection. These findings suggest specific genomic traits that are key to understanding and monitoring evolution of influenza viruses that circulate within bird populations.

To better understand how these processes influence phylogenetic reconstruction, we conducted a comprehensive phylogenomic study in the complex genus Packera. With over 90 species and varieties (40% of which exhibit polyploidy, aneuploidy, or other cytological complexities), Packera presents significant challenges for phylogenetic reconstruction. Given these complexities, we assessed the impact of different published orthology inference methods on the resulting evolutionary relationships and phylogenetic support of this group. We then applied three paralog-processing methods to evaluate their impact on tree topology and our understanding of Packera's evolutionary history by constructing a time-calibrated phylogeny, reconstructing historical biogeography, and testing for ancient reticulation. Unsurprisingly, phylogenetic outcomes varied depending on the paralog processing method used, with no method performing the best overall over others. Our findings highlight the profound impact of orthology inference and paralog processing on phylogenomic analyses, particularly in polyploid-rich groups such as Packera, and we offer guidance on methodological impacts along with practical recommendations. We note that gaining a robust understanding of Packera's evolutionary history requires more than computational approaches alone and while technological advancements have greatly expanded our ability to analyze genomic data, effective phylogenomic research still relies on strong taxon sampling and detailed species knowledge. Without careful attention to the biological context, such as species boundaries, cytological variation, and ecological interactions, phylogenomic studies risk misinterpreting evolutionary history and processes.

Broomrape (Orobanche cumana), a devastating parasitic plant, presents a formidable challenge to sunflower production, yet the genetic mechanisms underlying host resistance are still largely unknown. To address this gap, we developed a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify root infestation in a highly diverse sunflower association mapping (SAM) population. Using a dual GWAS approach with both SNPs and k-mers, we were able to pinpoint the genetic basis of resistance. Our findings validate previously identified QTLs with greater resolution and reveal several novel candidate genes conferring resistance, including putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases. Critically, the k-mer mapping approach circumvented reference genome bias, highlighting key introgressions from wild Helianthus species that have contributed to broomrape resistance. This research provides a powerful methodology for gene discovery and demonstrates that wild relatives remain a vital source of genetic material, offering breeders a significant advantage in the ongoing battle against rapidly evolving parasites.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}
{"title": "A plant-centric investigation of Class B Flavin-dependent Monooxygenase evolution and structural diversity", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.16.676513", "authors": "Christensen, J. M.; Neilson, E. H.", "abstract": "Class B Flavin-dependent monooxygenases (FMOs) are ancient and ubiquitous enzymes, present throughout diverse kingdoms of life. These enzymes utilize flavin-based coenzymes to incorporate an oxygen atom into their substrate, thereby altering its chemical properties. In plants, FMOs perform crucial catalytic functions essential for plant health, particularly within hormone biosynthesis, defense compound production, and immunogenic responses. Despite the evolutionary significance of class B FMOs across life, their evolution within the plant lineage remains underexplored and underrepresented. Here we present a comprehensive, plant-centric phylogenetic investigation of class B FMOs to uncover lineage-specific evolutionary patterns and structural diversification. Using known Class B FMOs as baits, a large selection of flavin-related proteins was assembled from species representing key lineages across Viridiplantae. Structural domain architecture and motif analysis was used to accurately define different Class B FMOs, resulting in eight distinct class B FMO families. Three families include the canonical YUCCA, N-OX and S-OX FMOs, which remain the most abundant and prevalent across the plant kingdom. Three families are novel, encompassing a small selection of bryophyte FMOs. The analysis also expanded the BVMO family to include monilophyte and angiosperm members, and a potential YUCCA-related family is reclassified as the evolutionary distinct \"Seedless FMO\" family. Considerable structural diversification within the NADPH-binding domain is observed across the eight families, and by assessing structurally conserved folds rather than amino acid sequence, a refined set of conserved FMO-specific motifs is defined. Overall, this phylogenetic and structural analysis provides new insights into FMO evolution and provides an important foundational framework to aid functional characterization of class B FMOs in plants.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

This study presents a comprehensive benchmark comparison of three prominent Boolean network optimization methods--Caspo, MEIGO, and CellNOpt (ILP and GA)--evaluating their performance across structural robustness, method reliability, and biological relevance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the primary optimization criterion. Through systematic analysis of network reconstruction under varying perturbation levels (10-90%), we demonstrate that each method exhibits distinct performance profiles: CASPO achieves optimal topological similarity with computational efficiency, ILP produces reasonable MSE minimization but with high variance, while GA shows superior functional reconstruction stability despite longer computational requirements. Our results reveal critical limitations in current evaluation approaches, particularly the insufficient discriminatory power of F1 scores and Hamming distance metrics, and highlight fundamental trade-offs between data fitting accuracy and topological preservation in extended simulations. The analysis demonstrates that no single optimization method dominates across all criteria, with all methods showing significant performance degradation at perturbation thresholds above 10-30%, suggesting that method selection should be application-specific and guided by requirements for computational efficiency, reconstruction accuracy, and robustness to structural uncertainty in prior knowledge networks.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

Previous analyses suggest that the energetic costs of small insertions and deletions (indels) influence genome size by altering the cellular energy budget. Here, we present a theoretical framework for genome evolution in phytoplankton, the main producers of the sunlit ocean, whose growth depends on nutrient availability. We derive an expression for the selection coefficient on indels as a function of four parameters, including the minimum amount of nutrient inside the cell. Parameter estimates indicate that 1-bp indels can be counterselected in phytoplankton with minimal nutrient requirements. We then test three predictions of nutrient-driven selection on genome evolution. Altogether, this model provides a quantitative and mathematical basis for the genome streamlining hypothesis.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

S.; Gokhale, C. S.", "abstract": "Synchronizing mating to extrinsic environmental cycles can increase the chance of successful reproduction. However, the resulting temporally-assorted mating may precipitate speciation if coupled with divergent selection. This process might be particularly relevant to the marine midge Clunio marinus, which synchronizes its reproduction to different lunar phases. In Roscoff (France) two sympatric populations differ in reproductive timing but are still connected by gene flow. A previous study found a relationship between the timing of reproduction and larval depth in the intertidal zone. Building on this observation, we ask if the link between reproductive timing and depth could be a mechanism for divergence when coupled with competition-induced density-dependent fitness. We devise an individual-based model replicating the reproductive behavior of C. marinus and find that sympatric divergence can occur, even when we model sexual reproduction with recombination and an explicit genetic basis. Our results suggest this mechanism is a likely hypothesis for the allochronic divergence observed in the Roscoff populations. Additionally, our study provides insights into how density-dependent fitness and competition may play a role in allochronic divergence in general.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

V.; Sasser, K. T.; Weber, J. N.", "abstract": "Assessing intraspecific variation in thermal tolerance can provide insights on how rising global temperatures will differentially impact individual organisms and populations. The oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance hypothesis (OCLTTH) posits that aerobic scope (AS), the difference between standard and maximal metabolic rate, underpins other ecologically relevant metrics of performance. Here we assess short- and long-term thermal tolerance of benthic and limnetic ecotypes of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) fish through common garden measurements of heritable variation in AS and parasite immunity. We predicted that benthic fish would display higher thermal tolerance resulting from adaptation to the relatively large thermal fluctuations in the shallow lakes that they inhabit. Based on the OCLTTH, we also expected that AS would decline with temperature and be a precursor for reduced condition. Although data connecting parasite immunity and temperature are limited, we predicted oxygen limitation would impair parasite resistance at higher temperature, particularly in the high-immunity limnetic fish. Despite exposing fish to temperatures below their thermal maxima, survival decreased with temperature and was most pronounced in limnetic fish at the highest temperature. The evolved thermal resilience of benthic stickleback was associated with their AS stability, suggesting that at least some populations of this keystone species are capable of withstanding hotter climates. However, contrary to the OCLTTH, temperature associated changes in AS were not associated with declines in fish condition or immunity.", "date": "2025-09-16", "journal": ""}

This completely independently assembled genome also allows confirmation of previously reported features of the nettle genome, including (1) a high degree of structural variation between haplotypes, including large inversions, (2) the likely existence of polycentric centromeres, and (3) the presence of urticaceous pain peptide sequences. Chromosome 8 stands out for its multiple large, nested inversions and high levels of repetitive sequences, features that are often associated with sex determining regions (SDRs).
