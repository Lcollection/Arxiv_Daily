Psychostimulant use disorders have a heritable genetic component that remains unexplained. Methamphetamine targets membrane and vesicular transporters to increase synaptic dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. We previously identified Hnrnph1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1) as a quantitative trait gene underlying methamphetamine behavioral sensitivity. Hnrnph1 encodes the RNA-binding protein hnRNP H1 that is ubiquitously expressed in neurons throughout the brain. Gene-edited mice with a heterozygous frameshift deletion in Hnrnph1s first coding exon of showed reduced methamphetamine-induced dopamine release and behaviors. To inform the mechanism linking hnRNP H with methamphetamine neurobehavioral effects, we surveyed the mRNA targetome of hnRNP H via cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with RNA-sequencing in striatal tissue at baseline and at 30 min post-methamphetamine in wild-type male and female C57BL/6J mice. Methamphetamine induced changes in RNA-binding targets of hnRNP H in mice, including differential binding to 3UTR targets and multiple enriched mRNAs involved in synaptic plasticity. Targetome, transcriptome, and spliceome analyses triangulated on Cacna2d2 as a suggestive target, with differences in hnRNP H binding, gene expression and splicing following methamphetamine treatment (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Furthermore, pre-treatment with pregabalin, an inhibitor of 2{delta}2 and 2{delta}1 voltage-gated calcium channel subunits, attenuated methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity in male and female mice, supporting a role for Cacna2d1/d2 in methamphetamine locomotor stimulant sensitivity. Our study identifies a dynamic hnRNP H RNA targetome that can rapidly and adaptively respond to methamphetamine to regulate gene expression and likely synaptic plasticity and behavior.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Early life adversity (ELA) predisposes individuals to both physical and mental disorders lifelong. How ELA affects brain function leading to this vulnerability is under intense investigation. Research has begun to shed light on ELA effects on localized brain regions within defined circuits. However, investigations into brain-wide neural activity that includes multiple localized regions, determines relationships of activity between regions and identifies shifts of activity in response to experiential conditions is necessary. Here, we performed longitudinal manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to image the brain in normally reared or ELA-exposed adults. Images were captured in the freely moving home cage condition, and short- and long-term after naturalistic threat. Images were analyzed with new computational methods, including automated segmentation and fractional activation or difference volumes. We found that neural activity was increased after ELA compared to normal rearing in multiple brain regions, some of which are involved in defensive and/or reward circuitry. Widely distributed patterns of neural activity, brain states, and their dynamics after threat were altered with ELA. Upon acute threat, ELA-mice retained heightened neural activity within many of these regions, and new hyperactive responses emerged in monoaminergic centers of the mid- and hindbrain. Nine days after acute threat, heightened neural activity remained within locus coeruleus and increased within posterior amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and dorso- and ventromedial hypothalamus, while reduced activity emerged within medial prefrontal cortical regions (prelimbic, infralimbic, anterior cingulate). These results reveal that functional imbalances arise between multiple brain-systems which are dependent upon context and cumulative experiences after ELA.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

These subregions mediate various processes of procedural learning. However, it remains unclear when and how striatal subregions engage in the acquisition of sensory stimulus-based decision-making. A neuroimaging of regional brain activity shows that the anterior dorsolateral striatum (aDLS) and posterior ventrolateral striatum (pVLS) in rats are activated in a different temporal pattern during the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination. Chronic and transient pharmacologic manipulations show that the aDLS promotes the behavioral strategy driven by the stimulus-response association while suppressing that by the response-outcome association, and that the pVLS contributes to forming and maintaining the stimulus-response strategy. Electrophysiological recording indicates that subpopulations of aDLS neurons predominantly represent the outcome of specific behaviors at the initial period of discrimination learning, and that pVLS subpopulations encode the beginning and ending of each behavior according to the progress of learning. In addition, other subpopulations of striatal neurons indicate sustained activation after obtaining reward with distinct patterns reflecting the stimulus-response associations. Our findings demonstrate that aDLS and pVLS neurons integrate the new learning of auditory discrimination in spatiotemporally and functionally different manners.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

A first set of analysis indicated that only downy mildew (DM) significantly affects yield (mass of grape clusters harvested) in our experimental conditions. We then leverage this situation to model the relationship between DM severity (measured by standardized AUDPC) and yield losses at vine stock scale. For AUDPC ranging from 0 to 10%, an increase of the severity of DM of 1% on the clusters decrease yield by 2% regardless of years and sites. These values ranges from 1.1% to 9% when considering the severity of DM on the foliage, depending on sites and years. This variability was correlated with a moisture risk index calculated between crop stages inflorescences visibles to pre-ripening of the berries. An increase of the severity of DM of 1% on the foliage decreases yield by 1.2% during dry year (quantile 10% of the index), by 3.3% during intermediate year (median the index) and by 7.3% during wet year (quantile 90% of the index).

These cells exhibit marked tuning curve and rate changes when an animal's environment is sufficiently manipulated, in a process known as remapping. Place cells are accompanied by many other spatially tuned cells such as border cells and grid cells, but how these cells interact during navigation and remapping is unknown. In this work, we build a normative place cell model wherein a neural network is tasked with accurate position reconstruction and path integration. Motivated by the notion of a cognitive map, the network's position is estimated directly from its learned representations. To obtain a position estimate, we propose a non-trainable decoding scheme applied to network output units, inspired by the localized firing patterns of place cells. We find that output units learn place-like spatial representations, while upstream recurrent units become boundary-tuned. When the network is trained to perform the same task in multiple simulated environments, its place-like units learn to remap like biological place cells, displaying global, geometric and rate remapping. These remapping abilities appear to be supported by rate changes in upstream units. While the model does not learn grid-like units, its place unit centers form clusters organized in a hexagonal lattice in open fields. When we decode the center locations of CA1 place fields in mice, we find preliminary evidence of a similar clustering tendency. This suggests a potential mechanism for the interaction between place cells, border cells, and grid cells. Our model provides a normative framework for learning spatial representations previously reserved for biological place cells, providing new insight into place cell field formation and remapping.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, we introduce ArtiDock - an ML-based docking technique optimized for high-throughput virtual screening applications. To evaluate ArtiDock, we developed a dedicated performance and accuracy benchmark for pocket-specific rigid protein-ligand docking, which mimics realistic industrial drug discovery scenarios and is based on the novel PLINDER dataset. We demonstrate that ArtiDock is 29-38% more accurate in comparison to leading open-source and commercial classical docking techniques such as AutoDock, Vina, and Glide, while providing a low computational cost. ArtiDock notably excels in challenging docking scenarios involving unbound protein structures and binding sites containing ions and structured water molecules.

Aside from the identification of causal genes, other difficult challenges to informing GWAS include characterizing the roles of predicted causal genes in disease and providing additional functional context, such as the cell type predictions or biological pathways in which causal genes operate. Leveraging single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) can assist in informing BMD GWAS by linking disease-associated variants to genes and providing a cell type context for which these causal genes drive disease. Here, we use large-scale scRNA-seq data from bone marrow-derived stromal cells cultured under osteogenic conditions (BMSC-OBs) from Diversity Outbred (DO) mice to generate cell type-specific networks and contextualize BMD GWAS-implicated genes. Using trajectories inferred from the scRNA-seq data that map cell state transitions, we identify networks enriched with genes that exhibit the most dynamic changes in expression across trajectories. We discover 21 network driver genes, which are likely to be causal for human BMD GWAS associations that colocalize with expression/splicing quantitative trait loci (eQTL/sQTL). These driver genes, including Fgfrl1 and Tpx2, along with their associated networks, are predicted to be novel regulators of BMD via their roles in the differentiation of mesenchymal lineage cells.

Y.; Daugherty, M. R.; Smith, D. M.", "abstract": "Enhancing proteasome function has been a long-standing but challenging target of interest for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing the importance of understanding proteasome activation mechanisms. Most proteasome activator complexes use the C-terminal HbYX (hydrophobic-tyrosine-almost any residue) motif to bind and trigger gate-opening in the 20S proteasome. This study defines a critical molecular interaction in the HbYX mechanism that triggers gate opening. We focus on the Hb site interaction and find it plays a surprisingly central and crucial role in driving the allosteric conformational changes that induce gate opening in the archaeal 20S. We examined the cryo-EM structure of two mutant archaeal proteasomes, V24Y T20S and V24F T20S. These two mutants were engineered to place a bulky aromatic residue in the HbYX hydrophobic pocket; both mutants are highly active, though their mechanisms of activation are undefined. Collectively, our findings indicate that the interaction between the Hb group of the HbYX motif and its corresponding hydrophobic pocket is sufficient to induce gate opening in a mechanistically similar way to the HbYX motif. The activation mechanism studied here involves the expansion of the hydrophobic binding site, allosterically altering the state of the IT switch thus triggering gate-opening. Furthermore, we show that the canonical K66 residue, previously understood to be critical for proteasome activator binding, also plays a key role in stabilizing the open gate, irrespective of activator binding. This study differentiates between the residues in the HbYX motif that support binding interactions (\"YX\") versus those that allosterically contribute to gate opening (\"Hb\"). The insights reported here will guide future drug development efforts, particularly in designing small molecule proteasome activators, by targeting the identified hydrophobic pocket.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

The degree to which these cells interact in response to CNS damage is poorly understood, and even less so, in the neural retina which poses a challenge for high resolution imaging in vivo. In this study, we deploy fluorescence adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to study microglia and neutrophils in mice. We simultaneously track immune cell dynamics using label-free phase-contrast AOSLO at micron-level resolution. Retinal lesions were induced with 488 nm light focused onto photoreceptor (PR) outer segments. These lesions focally ablated PRs, with minimal collateral damage to cells above and below the plane of focus. We used in vivo (AOSLO, SLO and OCT) imaging to reveal the natural history of the microglial and neutrophil response from minutes-to-months after injury. While microglia showed dynamic and progressive immune response with cells migrating into the injury locus within 1-day after injury, neutrophils were not recruited despite close proximity to vessels carrying neutrophils only microns away. Post-mortem confocal microscopy confirmed in vivo findings. This work illustrates that microglial activation does not recruit neutrophils in response to acute, focal loss of PRs, a condition encountered in many retinal diseases.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have highlighted the substantial intratumor heterogeneity of breast cancer, wherein malignant cells of distinct intrinsic subtypes co-exist within the same tumor. However, most existing subtyping methods are designed for bulk transcriptomic data and are therefore limited in their ability to resolve such intratumor heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. To address this gap, we develop UBS93, a computational framework that enables robust molecular subtyping of both bulk tumor samples and individual breast cancer cells. We rigorously validate UBS93 and demonstrate its superior performance relative to existing approaches, particularly in identifying the highly aggressive Claudin-low subtype. Applying UBS93 to singlecell RNA sequencing data from human Basal-like breast cancers, we identify the co-existence of Basal-like and Claudin-low cancer cell populations within the same tumor-a form of intratumor heterogeneity previously observed only in mouse models with genetically engineered RAS pathway alterations. Further analyses suggest that Claudin-low cancer cells originate from Basal-like population, with down-regulation of transcription factor ELF3 playing a pivotal role in the Basal-like/Claudin-low transition. Together, our findings establish UBS93 as a powerful tool for breast cancer subtyping and uncover a previously unrecognized layer of intratumor heterogeneity in human Basal-like breast cancer.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we fitted a unique mechanistic model to a detailed 10-years longitudinal dataset from four sites in Northern France, where I. ricinus is abundant and Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis have been reported for decades, within a Bayesian framework. By incorporating key demographic processes and the influence of environmental conditions on these processes, our model estimated oviposition, hatching, and moulting rates across a range of temperature or saturation deficit, as well as questing and vertebrate host contact rates. Notably, moulting peaked at 14.2{degrees}C (95%HDI: 12.5-16.1{degrees}C), substantially lower than commonly suggested by laboratory-based studies, whereas oviposition and hatching peaked at 24.4C (95%HDI: 10.9-27.2{degrees}C) and 24.7C (95%HDI: 17.8-27.2{degrees}C), respectively. Furthermore, vertebrate host contact rates significantly varied between the four study sites, with one site presenting up to 2.90 (95%HDI: 2.15-3.86) times higher contact rates than the other three sites. Additionally, we showed the importance of diapause in reproducing the observed seasonal population dynamics. For ticks overwintering through diapause, moulting in spring more accurately matched the predominantly unimodal questing activity patterns observed, compared to moulting in summer. Finally, model projections under several climate change scenarios indicated decreasing tick abundance trends over the next two decades.

Using genome-wide data from 207 individuals, we examined the contributions of demographic fluctuations, selection, and hybridisation in driving their speciation history. Demographic reconstructions revealed sequential bottlenecks and expansions coincident with lineage splits, and indicated a drift-driven scenario with no migration events for all five species. The genomic landscapes showed balancing selection, sparse divergent selection, and low net divergence. Introgressions from T. latifolia to T. angustifolia and T. domingensis were found.

However, the mechanisms governing SGC recruitment during memory formation and their role in engram refinement remains unresolved. By examining neurons labeled during contextual memory formation in TRAP2 mice, we empirically tested competing hypotheses for GC and SGC recruitment into memory ensembles. In support of the proposal that more excitable neurons are preferentially recruited into memory ensembles, SGCs showed greater sustained firing than GCs. Additionally, SGCs labeled during memory formation showed less adapting firing than unlabeled SGCs. Our recordings did not reveal glutamatergic connections between behaviorally labeled SGCs and GCs, providing evidence against SGC driven local circuit feedforward excitation in ensemble recruitment. Contrary to a leading hypothesis, there was little evidence for individual SGCs or labeled neuronal ensembles supporting lateral inhibition of unlabeled neurons. Instead, labeled GCs and SGCs received more spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs than their unlabeled counterparts. Moreover, pairs of GCs and SGCs within labeled neuronal cohorts received more temporally correlated spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs than labeled-unlabeled neuronal pairs, validating a role for correlated afferent inputs in neuronal ensemble selection. These findings challenge the proposal that SGCs drive dentate GC ensemble refinement, while supporting a role for intrinsic active properties and correlated inputs in preferential SGC recruitment to contextual memory engrams.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

The selected line exhibited an obese phenotype accompanied by midgut elongation, with BL tolerance dependent on gut microbiota-mediated lipid accumulation. Whole-genome and transcriptome analyses consistently highlighted interactions between the microbiota and host lipid metabolism-related genes. Remarkably, manipulating genes associated with lipid accumulation conferred BL tolerance even in the absence of selection. We suggest that the acquisition of BL tolerance occurs through 'adaptive obesity'. Our study introduces a mechanism of evolutionary adaptation of insects against BL-based selective pressure by maximising the benefits from the gut microbiota via midgut elongation.

An important but understudied potential driver of balancing selection is antagonistic pleiotropy between diploid and haploid stages of the plant life cycle. Despite sharing a common genome, sporophytes (2n) and gametophytes (n) may undergo differential or even opposing selection. Theoretical work suggests the antagonistic pleiotropy between life stages can generate balancing selection and maintain genetic variation. Despite the potential for far-reaching consequences of gametophytic selection, empirical tests of its pleiotropic effects (neutral, synergistic, or antagonistic) on sporophytes are generally lacking. Here, we examined the population genomic signals of selection across life stages in the angiosperm Rumex hastatulus and the moss Ceratodon purpureus. We compared gene expression among life stages and between sexes, combined with neutral diversity statistics and the analysis of the distribution of fitness effects. In contrast to what would be predicted under balancing selection due to antagonistic pleiotropy, we found that unbiased genes between life stages were under stronger purifying selection, likely explained by a predominance of synergistic pleiotropy between life stages and strong purifying selection on broadly expressed genes. In addition, we found that 30% of candidate genes under balancing selection in R. hastatulus were located within inversion polymorphisms. Our findings provide novel insights into the genome-wide characteristics and consequences of plant gametophytic selection.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Plants release defense volatile compounds that can deter herbivores. Among them are electrophilic toxins, such as isothiocyanates from mustard plants, that activate pain receptors by contact (i.e. taste) in many animals, including Drosophila melanogaster. While specialist insects have evolved strategies to tolerate toxicity and use mustard plants as hosts, it is unclear whether non-specialist insects detect and avoid electrophilic toxins via olfaction. To address this, and to understand if specialized insects co-opted these toxic compounds as hostplant olfactory cues, we leveraged closely related drosophilid species, including the microbe-feeding D. melanogaster and Scaptomyza pallida, and the mustard-feeding specialist S. flava. In olfactory assays, D. melanogaster exposed to allyl isothiocyanate volatiles were rapidly immobilized, demonstrating the high toxicity of this wasabi-derived compound to non-specialists. Through single sensillum electrophysiological recordings from olfactory organs and behavioral assays, we identified an Olfactory receptor (Or) necessary for volatile detection and behavioral aversion to allyl isothiocyanate in D. melanogaster. RNA sequencing and heterologous expression revealed that S. flava possess lineage-specific, triplicated homologs of this Or, and that each paralog exhibited broadened and distinct sensitivity to isothiocyanate compounds. Using AlphaFold2 modeling, site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological recordings, we identified two critical amino acid substitutions that changed the sensitivity of these paralogs from fruit-derived odors to isothiocyanates in the mustard specialist S. flava. Our findings show that non-specialists can detect electrophiles via olfaction, and that their olfactory systems can rapidly adapt to toxic hostplant niches through co-option and duplication of ancestral chemosensory genes with few amino acid changes.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

The characteristic cell wall-anchored Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) is expressed by all S. pyogenes strains and consists of a polyrhamnose backbone with alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chains, of which 25% are decorated with glycerol phosphate (GroP). The genes in the gacA-L cluster are critical for GAC biosynthesis with gacH-L being responsible for the characteristic GlcNAc-GroP decoration, which confers the agglutination in rapid test diagnostic assays and contributes to S. pyogenes pathogenicity. Historical research papers described S. pyogenes isolates, so-called A-variant strains, that lost the characteristic GlcNAc side chain following serial animal passage. Genomic analysis of a single viable historic parent/A-variant strain pair revealed a premature inactivating stop codon in gacI, explaining the described loss of the GlcNAc side chain. Subsequently, we analyzed the genetic variation of the 12 gacA-L genes in a collection of 2,021 S. pyogenes genome sequences. Although all gac genes (gacA-L) displayed genetic variation, we only identified 26 isolates (1.3%) with a premature stop codon in one of the gac genes. Twelve out of 26 (46%) isolates contained a premature stop codon in gacH, which encodes the enzyme responsible for the GroP modification. To study the functional consequences of the different premature stop codons for GacH function, we plasmid-expressed three gacH variants in a S. pyogenes gacH-deficient strain. Cell wall analysis confirmed GacH loss-of-function for the studied gacH variants through the significant reduction of GAC GroP, complete resistance to killing by the human bactericidal enzyme group IIA-secreted phospholipase, and susceptibility to zinc toxicity. Overall, our data provide a comprehensive overview of the genetic variation of the gacA-L cluster in a global population of S. pyogenes strains and the functional consequences of rare inactivating mutations in gacH for host interaction.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

But how VPC neurons process and integrate information from these two sensory modalities during perception remains unknown. To investigate this, we recorded the activity of VPC neurons in two trained monkeys performing a bimodal detection task (BDT). In the BDT, subjects reported the presence or absence of a tactile or an acoustic stimulus. Initial single-cell analyses revealed a diverse range of responses during the BDT: purely tactile, purely acoustic, bimodal and others that exhibited sustained activity during the decision maintenance delay, between the stimulus offset and motor report. To further explore the VPC's role in the BDT, we applied dimensionality reduction techniques to uncover the low-dimensional latent dynamics of the neuronal population and conducted parallel analyses on a recurrent neural network (RNN) model trained on the same task. Neural trajectories associated with tactile responses diverged strongly from those related to acoustic responses. Conversely, during the stimulus-absent trials the neural dynamics remained at rest. During the delay, the trajectories demonstrated a pronounced rotational dynamic toward a subspace orthogonal to the sensory response space, supporting memory maintenance in stable equilibria. This suggests that the network dynamics can sustain distinct stable states corresponding to the three potential task outcomes. Using low-dimensional modeling, we propose a universal dynamical mechanism underlying the transition from sensory to mnemonic processing, consistent with our experimental and computational observations. These findings show that the VPC contains neurons capable of bimodal coding and that its population can integrate competing sensory information and maintain decisions throughout the delay period, regardless of the sensory modality.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Accordingly, we analyzed multi-omics data generated at three timepoints from 193 Korean COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms, composed of whole genome sequencing, blood-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (2.15M cells), 195 cytokine profiles, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele data.

We elucidated a complex regulatory mechanism involving HLA genes and their targets, and identified genetic determinants of cytokine levels. Finally, we show how regulation of ieQTLs is established by upstream transcription factors (TFs), illustrating complex regulation of the IGFBP7 ieQTL by a combined action of two TFs, which is potentially important in conferring differential severity.

However, understanding the dynamic interplay between intracellular Ca2+ sinks and sources has been hindered by the lack of bright, photostable, and multiplexed measurements in different organelles, limiting our ability to define how Ca2+ shapes cell physiology across fields of biology. Here we introduce a new toolkit of chemigenetic organellar Ca2+ indicators whose color is tunable by reconstituting their fluorescence with different exogenous rhodamine dye-ligands, which significantly expand the capacity for multiplexing organellar Ca2+ measurements. These sensors, which we named ER-HaloCaMP and Mito-HaloCaMP, are optimized to report Ca2+ dynamics in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria of mammalian cells and neurons, and show significantly improved brightness, photostability and responsiveness when compared to current best-in-class alternatives. Using either red or far-red dye-ligands, both ER-HaloCaMP and Mito-HaloCaMP enable visualizing ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics in neuronal axons, a subcellular location that only contains a few ER tubules and small mitochondria, structural limitations that have impaired measurements with previous red sensors. To show the expanded multiplexing capacities of our toolkit, we measured interorganellar Ca2+ fluxes simultaneously in three different subcellular compartments in live cells, revealing that the amplitude of ER Ca2+ release controls the efficacy of ER-mitochondria Ca2+ coupling in a cooperative manner. Organellar HaloCaMPs enable also measuring Ca2+ dynamics in intact brain tissue from flies and rodents, demonstrating their versatility across biological models.

The reflection knockoffs substantially outperform Model-X knockoffs in feature selection, particularly when features are highly correlated. Our secondary contribution is a simple method to aggregate multiple sets of identically distributed knockoff statistics to improve the consistency of knockoff filters. In the study of proteomic signatures of age, single feature tests showed overly abundant proteomic association with age. Knockoff filters using reflection knockoffs and aggregation, however, revealed that a majority of these associations are hitchhikers instead of drivers.

While the pial arterial network - a critical supplier of intracortical perfusion - has been overlooked in this context, it may play a pivotal role in early vascular pathology. Here, we report extensive cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) within the pial artery and arteriole network in the J20 (PDGF-APPSw, Ind) mouse model of AD. Methods: Using premortem delivery of Methoxy-XO4 to label A{beta}, and arterial vascular labeling, we assessed A{beta} burden on the pial artery/arteriole network and cerebral blood flow in aged male and female WT and J20 AD mice. Results: We show that 12-month-old J20 mice exhibit significant A{beta} deposition across major leptomeningeal arteries (ACA, MCA) and pial collaterals, with ~40% vessel coverage in males and ~20% in females - substantially exceeding A{beta} levels in cortical or hippocampal vessels. This vascular A{beta} burden was accompanied by compensatory enlargement and increased tortuosity of pial collateral vessels. Yet, despite this apparent remodeling, CBF was reduced by ~15% in J20 mice, and this decline was significantly associated with leptomeningeal CAA burden. Conclusions: This is the first study to comprehensively characterize meningeal arterial A{beta} accumulation in a preclinical model of vascular AD, mirroring recent observations in early-stage human disease. Our findings implicate meningeal CAA as a potential driver of early CBF disruption and suggest that pial collateral remodeling may reflect a compensatory response to vascular insufficiency. Moreover, we identify robust sex differences in CAA burden, paralleling sex-specific patterns of parenchymal A{beta} pathology in humans. These results highlight the leptomeningeal vasculature as a novel and understudied locus for early AD pathology and a potential therapeutic target to preserve cerebrovascular integrity.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Increases in cytosolic noradrenaline (NA) concentration and MAO-A activity initiate the LC impairment through production of NA metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-glycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL), by MAO-A. However, how NA accumulates in soma/dendritic cytosol of LC neurons has never been addressed despite the fact that NA is virtually absent in cytosol while NA is produced exclusively in cytoplasmic vesicles from dopamine by dopamine-{beta}-hydroxylase. Since re-uptake of autocrine-released NA following spike activity is the major source of NA accumulation, we investigated whether and how chronic stress can increase the spike activity accompanied by NA autocrine. Overexcitation of LC neurons is normally prevented by the autoinhibition mediated by activation of 2A-adrenergic receptor (AR)-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium-current (GIRK-I) with autocrine-released NA. Patch-clamp study revealed that NA-induced GIRK-I in LC neurons was decreased in chronic restraint stress (RS) mice while a similar decrease was gradually caused by repeated excitation. Chronic RS caused internalization of 2A-ARs expressed in cell membrane in LC neurons and decreased protein/mRNA levels of 2A-ARs/GIRKs in membrane fraction. Subsequently, chronic RS increased the protein levels of MAO-A, DOPEGAL-induced asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) and tau N368. These results suggest that chronic RS-induced overexcitation due to the internalization of 2A-ARs/GIRK is accompanied by [Ca2+]i increases, subsequently increasing Ca2+-dependent MAO-A activity and NA-autocrine. Thus, it is likely that internalization of 2A-AR increased cytosolic NA, as reflected in AEP increases, by facilitating re-uptake of autocrine-released NA. The suppression of 2A-AR internalization has a strong translational potential for AD.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Systematic studies of Kcat are essential for characterizing the mechanisms underlying proteomic composition and cellular metabolism. However, experimental measurements of Kcat remain limited and prone to noise. To address this, we present KcatNet, a geometric deep learning model designed for high-throughput prediction of Kcat in metabolic enzymes across all organisms, leveraging paired enzyme sequence and substrate representations. KcatNet consistently outperforms existing predictors, particularly for enzymes with high catalytic efficiency, and demonstrates strong generalization to enzymes that are dissimilar to those in the training set. The model generates interpretable importance scores for enzyme residues involved in catalysis, thereby enabling a quantitative assessment of their contributions to catalytic activity. Furthermore, KcatNet uncovers structural mechanisms and interaction patterns within enzyme-substrate complexes, providing insights into architectural principles that are inaccessible with existing methods. We applied KcatNet to genome-scale Kcat prediction across diverse yeast species, improving proteome allocation predictions by integrating its outputs into metabolic models. Experimental validation further confirmed the model's ability to identify enzyme mutants with enhanced activity. By bridging the gap between sequence, structure, and function, KcatNet establishes a robust foundation for advancing understanding of molecular-level mechanisms and accelerating enzyme engineering efforts.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a novel interacting partner of YhdP, and discover that all three AsmA-superfamily proteins are recruited to, and strongly enriched, at the cell poles.

We demonstrate the utility of temperature sensitive RNA elements as a layer of post-transcriptional regulation to reduce the impact of promoter leak. We observe significant temperature-dependent increases in cell survival when certain RNA thermometers (RNATs) are placed upstream of the cas9 coding sequence. We show that the most highly repressing RNAT, hsp17rep, significantly reduces population skew with a library of characterized guide RNAs (gRNAs).

A central question is whether attention operates by enhancing all features of a selected target, or by optimizing neural encoding around the specific demands of the task--i.e., is selective attention fundamentally anchored around task targets or around task goals? Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed two speech tasks--comprehension and detection--on identical auditory stimuli. Task difficulty was manipulated by introducing controlled background noise that increased cognitive demands without reducing speech intelligibility. We developed a novel EEG-based method, the Modulation Response Function (MRF), which captures cortical sensitivity to spectro-temporal features via spectrogram reconstruction. Behaviorally, comprehension performance declined with increased difficulty, with greater reliance on semantic cues, while detection performance remained near ceiling. Neurally, both envelope tracking and MRF magnitude were higher during comprehension, reflecting greater cognitive engagement. Critically, spectro-temporal tuning differed across tasks: formant-related modulations were selectively enhanced during comprehension, whereas pitch-related modulations were emphasized during detection. These findings support a discriminative model of attention, where cortical encoding is flexibly reshaped according to cognitive goals, selectively amplifying the features most relevant for successful task performance.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Despite available therapies against ER+ BC, recurrence occurs in many patients due to therapeutic resistance. Semaphorin 7a (SEMA7A) is a biomarker associated with poor prognosis and endocrine therapy resistance for BC patients. Survival analyses of ER+ BC patients on endocrine therapy confirm early recurrence in patients with SEMA7A+ tumors. Thus, we aim to establish novel treatment strategies to improve outcomes for patients with ER+ SEMA7A+ BC. In this paper we investigate the mechanisms by which SEMA7A promotes resistance to endocrine therapy and its potential as a therapeutic target for ER+ BC. Our studies suggest that SEMA7A binds to integrins {beta}1 and {beta}4 (ITGB1, ITGB4) and activates AKT cell survival signaling via its RGD domain. Using a syngeneic ER+ model, TC11 tumors in FVB/N mice were treated with PI3K inhibitors (20mg/kg alpelisib; 10mg/kg GCT-007), alone or in combination with tamoxifen (0.5 mg/100uL peanut oil). TC11 tumors were also treated with a combination of an anti-SEMA7A antibody (SmAb H1) (100-250mg/kg) and fulvestrant (83mg/kg), compared to single agents. In vivo studies were validated in a second syngeneic ER+ model; SSM2 cells and 129SV-E mice. Our results demonstrate that direct inhibition of SEMA7A via SmAb H1 significantly reduces tumor growth of SEMA7A+ tumors, and the combination with fulvestrant may be even more effective. Our studies suggest that patients with ER+SEMA7A+ tumors should be candidates for PI3K-targeted therapies or anti-SEMA7A-based therapy.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

R.; Engel, A. K.", "abstract": "Introduction Our representation of time is embedded within multisensory perception, based on sight, sound, or touch. However, despite being a crucial aspect of daily life, the neural dynamics of cross-modal temporal predictions remain elusive. The objective of this study was to investigate neural correlates of tactile-to-visual influences on temporal prediction using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We hypothesized to observe increased inter-trial phase consistency (ITPC) in the low-frequency delta range (0.5-4 Hz) due to their involvement in temporal prediction. In addition, stronger ITPC values should correlate with a steeper slope of the psychometric function, indicating phase alignments as a likely cause of more consistent temporal predictions. Methods The study was conducted within one MEG session where participants (N=23) carried out a temporal prediction task. Participants observed a visual stimulus moving towards an occluder. Shortly before reaching the occluder, the visual stimulus faded in luminance to make the visual offset less informative. Instead, participants received a brief tactile stimulus to the ipsilateral hand at the time point of disappearance, generating a temporal expectation regarding its reappearance on the opposite side of the occluder. After variable time intervals, a visual stimulus reappeared, and participants had to indicate whether this was too early or too late compared to the movement before disappearance. A non-predictive control condition involved participants judging the variable luminance of the reappearing visual stimulus compared to its initial luminance at the beginning of the trial. Psychometric curves were fitted to the behavioral data of each participant and condition, and MEG recordings were analyzed using time-frequency representations obtained by wavelet convolution. To compare spectral power and ITPC estimates between conditions within frequency bands showing significant differences to the pre-stimulus baseline, we used cluster-based permutation statistics. Pearson's correlations were used to examine the relationship between ITPC or power estimates and the steepness of each participant's psychometric function. Results ITPC analysis revealed strong increases in the delta range around stimulus disappearance and reappearance. Delta ITPC was significantly stronger during temporal prediction compared to the control condition. Clusters included sensors from right temporal and frontal regions, contralaterally to the visuo-tactile stimulus presentation. Only delta ITPC, but not delta power, correlated with the consistency of temporal prediction. Furthermore, temporal prediction was associated with increased alpha power in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, as well as the right superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus, whereas beta power did not show differences between conditions. Conclusion Our findings suggest that increased delta ITPC is likely caused by phase resets driven by the temporal prediction process. Furthermore, our findings indicate that phase alignments occur during crossmodal visuo-tactile-to-visual temporal predictions, even with a combination of non-rhythmic and discrete stimulation. This highlights the broad applicability of phase resets of neural oscillations as a mechanism for predicting timing across various types of stimuli.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Building on our prior work in {beta}-cells, we sought to determine whether the mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle is involved in -cell amino acid sensing. Three different methods were used to probe the PEP cycle, including pyruvate kinase activators (TEPP-46), and mice with -cell specific deletion of pyruvate kinase (PKM1/2-KO) or mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase (PCK2-KO). The mitochondrial fuels glutamine/leucine antagonized alanine/arginine-stimulated Ca2+ influx and glucagon secretion under hypoglycemic conditions. Both PKM1/2 and PCK2 were required for glutamine/leucine to close KATP channels and limit amino acid-stimulated membrane depolarization. The Ca2+ response to amino acids was suppressed by pyruvate kinase activation with TEPP-46, and enhanced by -cell deletion of pyruvate kinase or PCK2 - all without changing glucagon secretion. Finally, using diazoxide/KCl to probe the pathways downstream of membrane depolarization, we identified an essential role of the PEP cycle in homeostatically restoring intracellular Ca2+ levels. In sum, the -cell mitochondrial PEP cycle senses glutamine/leucine and inhibits KATP channels similarly to {beta}-cells, while restricting amino acid-stimulated membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx. However, defying expectations, none of the amino acids tested, including alanine/arginine, regulate glucagon secretion by modulating membrane depolarization or intracellular Ca2+.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

(red palm weevil), Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) (Indian meal moth), and Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (beet armyworm). Laboratory bioassays revealed distinct differences in larval survival and mortality across the species. Neem oil demonstrated high effectiveness against S. exigua larvae, achieving 100% mortality at all tested dietary concentrations, and moderate effectiveness against R. ferrugineus. In contrast, it had no significant effect on P. interpunctella. Boric acid was proved to be universally effective, leading to 100% mortality in all three species at its highest concentration. Gallotannin acid had species-specific effects on S. exigua but had negligible effects on R. ferrugineus and P. interpunctella. These findings highlight the potential of natural, low-toxicity compounds as alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Additionally, this study suggests new frontiers for investigating the role of the gut microbiota in mediating the effectiveness of these compounds.

However, accurately identifying these \"key tuning\" residues remains challenging. In this study, we present an information-theoretic approach, inspired from signal processing methods, to identify key residues in protein sequences. We propose a feature selection framework that integrates both unsupervised and supervised approaches, using Shannon entropy and mutual information as initial priors, respectively. A key aspect of our method is the use of Cramer's V and Thiel's U to decouple coevolved residues. The supervised approach employed mutual information to assess residue relationships, followed by evolutionary decoupling with Cramer's V to better decouple individual contributions. This two-step process demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to DeepSequence, a leading tool (p-value=0.0149). The unsupervised approach, based solely on Shannon entropy prior to decoupling, showed competitive performance despite a slightly lower statistical significance (pvalue=0.14). Although the supervised method yields higher accuracy given sufficient training data, the unsupervised technique is simpler, requiring only a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) that can be obtained via BLAST. When applied to a system with well-characterised structural information, specifically nanobody-antigen interactions, our methods not only effectively identified the binding residues but also accurately reconstructed a contiguous binding surface, surpassing current state-of-the-art computational tools. Collectively, our methods provide a flexible and interpretable solution for various protein engineering applications. This work contributes to the broader field of protein structure-function mapping by offering a computationally efficient and transparent approach for identifying key tuning residues, paving the way for new strategies in rational protein design and functional modulation with potential applications in drug discovery, enzyme optimization, and novel protein development.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

We found that exercise increased the release of exomiR-196a-5p in endurance athletes, a microRNA that induces UCP1 expression and browning of white adipocytes. We observed that myotubes specifically release miR-196a-5p within small EVs after in vitro exercise-mimicking conditions such as electrical pulse stimulation and cAMP treatment.

Overexpression of miR-342-3p increased Myogenin levels during skeletal muscle cell differentiation, indicating a positive role in muscle differentiation.

Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and microtubule sedimentation assays performed with recombinant proteins suggest direct interaction between purified KASH5 and KIF5B on microtubules. Mapping KIF5B-binding surface of KASH5, revealed that KASH5 N-terminal EF-hand domains mediate the interaction.

ADPKD is caused by mutations in Pkd1/Pkd2 genes that encode for polycystins that localize to primary cilia. The primary cilium is a miniscule subcellular compartment for generating signaling outputs that profoundly affect cellular function. Severe cystogenesis from polycystin loss is mostly cilia dependent. However, the polycystin-repressed ciliary signals that promote cyst growth are unknown and have been challenging to uncouple from downstream cystogenic pathways. Here we aimed at differentiating ciliary adenylyl cyclase signaling from total cellular changes in second messenger cAMP implicated in cystogenesis. We studied an Ankyrin repeat and MYND domain protein, ANKMY2 that we previously implicated in maturation and ciliary localization of adenylyl cyclases in fibroblasts. We studied kidney-specific conditional knockout mouse models of Ankmy2/Pkd1 and ciliary localization of adenylyl cyclases in kidney epithelial cells. We found suppression of early postnatal renal cystogenesis and prolonged survival in an embryonic onset Pkd1 deletion model from ANKMY2 loss. Phosphorylated CREB formation, from elevated cellular cAMP levels, remained unaffected. Cyst load in male mice in an adult inducible conditional Pkd1 deletion model was suppressed from ANKMY2 loss. Mechanistically, ANKMY2 determined ciliary trafficking of adenylyl cyclases in kidney epithelial cells without disrupting cilia. Further, ANKMY2 loss prevented ciliary length increase in ADPKD mouse models irrespective of cyst load or sex. Cilia length increase was seen preceding cystogenesis. Our results suggest that targeting of adenylyl cyclases to renal epithelial cilia promotes PC1/2-inhibited cilia-dependent cyst activation distinct from cyst progression involving cellular cAMP.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Our results demonstrated that the variant contained the signal peptide (Sp), propeptide (P), metalloprotease (Mp), disintegrin-like (Dis), thrombospondin type-1 repeat 1 (Tsp1-1) and cysteine-rich (Cys) domains, while the spacer (Spc) and CUB domains were absent. The Tsp1-2-8 domain was partially present. Additionally, this variant possessed partial vWF cleavage activity compared to full-length ADAMTS13. Thus, we identified a novel isoform of ADAMTS13, generated due to exon skipping in human MSCs, which retained partial activity towards vWF cleavage.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Our primary objective was to elucidate the localization of LOXs within human endometrial tissues and to investigate the expression profile of LOXs during in vitro human endometrial stromal cell decidualization. Immunohistochemical localization revealed that all LOXs were expressed in human endometrium during both the proliferative and secretory phases of menstrual cycle. All five LOXs were expressed in human endometrial stromal cells cultured in vitro. Gene expression levels of LOX, LOXL1, and LOXL2 significantly decreased during endometrial stromal cell decidualization in vitro. In contrast, LOXL3 and LOXL4 gene expression remained unaffected. Protein levels of LOX, LOXL1, and LOXL3 also showed a significant reduction. Additionally, conditioned media analysis revealed abundant secretion and release of LOX and LOXL1-3 into the extracellular space at all time points examined, with their levels remaining constant. The primary targets of LOXs, collagen and elastic fibers, undergo significant synthesis and processing during endometrial stromal cell decidualization in vitro. This observation was supported by the differential gene expression levels of factors involved in their processing and assembly.

Here, we show that PINK1 is additionally modified by non-canonical, lysine-independent SUMOylation, mediated by mitochondrial anchored protein ligase (MAPL). Levels of PINK1 SUMOylation are reduced by the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP, whereas they are increased by the inhibitor of proteasomal degradation MG132.

We show that SQ-1 sensitises p62 to oxidation and promotes its disulphide-mediated oligomerisation in response to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). This ROS-dependent activation of p62-mediated selective autophagy enhances the clearance of ROS-generating mitochondria and restores cell viability in models of Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease, which is marked by impaired autophagic flux.

Despite their centrality to cell biology, the relevance of peroxisomes to aging remains understudied. We recently reported that peroxisomes are degraded en masse via pexophagy during early aging in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and we found that downregulating the peroxisome-fission protein PRX-11/PEX11 prevents this age-dependent pexophagy and extends lifespan. Here, we further investigated how prx-11 inhibition promotes longevity. Remarkably, we found that reducing peroxisome degradation with age led to concurrent improvements in another organelle: mitochondria. Animals lacking prx-11 function showed tubular, youthful mitochondria in older ages, and these enhancements required multiple factors involved in mitochondrial tubulation and biogenesis, including FZO-1/Mitofusin, UNC-43 protein kinase, and DAF-16/FOXO. Importantly, mutation of each of these factors negated lifespan extension in prx-11-defective animals, indicating that pexophagy inhibition promotes longevity only if mitochondrial health is co-maintained. Our data support a model in which peroxisomes and mitochondria track together with age and interdependently influence animal lifespan.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

The model predicts a speed-accuracy tradeoff, whereby slow cells are significantly more accurate and able to follow efficiently a weak chemoattractant signal. We then compare the model's predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and migrating in-vitro inside a regular lattice of pillars.

Serotonin, which acts as a neurotransmitter in adults and is crucial for regulating male sexual behavior, also serves as a neurotrophic factor during early brain development. Yet, the long-term consequences of perinatal SSRI exposure on adult sexual functioning remain poorly understood. This study investigates the long-term effects of perinatal SSRI exposure on the sexual behavior of adult male rats in a seminatural environment. During pregnancy and lactating, mother rats were administered either fluoxetine (FLX, 10 mg/kg) or a control solution (CTR, 1% Methylcellulose) daily via oral gavage. Upon reaching adulthood, male offspring were assessed for sexual performance in a semi-natural setting, where they lived in mixed-sex groups for eight days. Comprehensive observations of sexual, social, and conflict behaviors were scoring from the first to the last copulatory behavior during the period in which female rats were sexually receptive. Our findings reveal that perinatal FLX exposure significantly increases sexual behavior in adult male rats, as evidenced by a higher total number of copulatory behaviors. This suggests that elevated serotonin levels during early development have enduring consequences for male rat sexual behavior in adulthood, potentially enhancing reproductive strategies and success in naturalistic environments.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Several studies have also identified missense variants of TREM2 to be associated with frontotemporal dementia and Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD). To date, 51 novel missense variants of TREM2 have been identified in the literature, with the disease risk profiles of most variants still unknown. Assessing and classifying the pathogenicity of these variants is essential to investigate the disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments. Herein, we classified 32 missense variants involved in TREM2 using structural bioinformatic data with AlphaFold2. Using the protocol described in our previous work (Pillai et al., 2025), we determined the structural, stability, and potential functional effects of these variants. Our evaluations of the mutations were divided into those (i) implicated in NHD, (ii) located on the transmembrane domain, (iii) surface of the IgV-like domain, and (iii) buried in the receptor. Our analysis of variants involved in NHD suggests that, while V126G imposes the greatest effects, the T66M variant exerts significantly less effects on the TREM2 structures compared to the other remaining variants. Variants in the transmembrane domain of TREM2 did not impose significant alterations to the three-dimensional structure. Outside of known variants in the IgV-like domain, we identified 10 variants that imposed significant destabilizing effects to the structure and are of potential interest.

The role of filopodia in chemotactic guidance in fast-moving amoeboid cells has not been well-studied. The social amoeba Dictyostelium relies on chemotaxis for development and finding food, making it an excellent system for investigating the role of filopodia in amoeboid chemotaxis. Stimulation of amoebae with the chemoattractant cAMP activates a transient increase of filopodia formation by recruiting the filopodial myosin DdMyo7 to the cell cortex. Filopodia formation is biased towards the source of chemoattractant, yet myo7 null cells that lack filopodia exhibit normal directional migration. However, cells either lacking filopodia or having increased numbers of filopodia move more slowly than those with wildtype numbers of filopodia. Thus, while filopodia are dispensable for detection of chemical gradients by amoeboid cells, changes in filopodia number can impact their migration speed possibly due to altering cell-substrate adhesion.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

ALT relies on recombination-mediated telomere elongation and is promoted by telomeric replication stress. However, ALT requires strict regulation, as excessive replication stress or recombination are cytotoxic. Central to ALT is the RecQ helicase BLM, which regulates telomeric replication stress and promotes telomere recombination and DNA synthesis. Despite its key role in the ALT pathway, BLM must be tightly regulated to prevent deleterious outcomes. Here, we identify SLX4IP as a key suppressor of BLM-driven replication stress at ALT telomeres. Loss of SLX4IP in ALT-positive cells leads to BLM-dependent telomeric replication stress and impaired replication fork progression. Mechanistically, SLX4IP limits the unwinding of unligated Okazaki fragments by BLM on the lagging strand during telomere replication. This reduces the formation of toxic 5' DNA flaps and prevents hyperactivation of ATR signalling and deleterious recombination levels. We also uncover a synthetic lethal interaction between SLX4IP and FANCM, an ATPase/translocase that is a known regulator of BLM at telomeric replication forks in ALT cells. We demonstrate that SLX4IP and FANCM act in parallel to restrain BLM activity, thereby maintaining the balance of replication stress and recombination that is necessary for productive ALT. These findings reveal a vulnerability in ALT-positive cancers lacking SLX4IP and establish SLX4IP as a potential biomarker for therapeutic strategies targeting FANCM.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

We report a novel approach using polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350), a water soluble, non-conductive polymer, as a doping agent to reduce specimen charging without sacrificing imaging quality. Although PEG 3350 alone lacks the mechanical and sectioning properties required for SBEM, we found it can be dissolved in standard Durcupan epoxy resin to improve charge resistance while maintaining physical integrity. Resins doped with 10% PEG 3350 demonstrated a substantial reduction in charging at 1.4 - 1.8 keV in charge-prone samples such as cultured HeLa cells, lung, and brain tissues, while retaining transparency and sectionability. Unlike other methods, the doped resin performs in high vacuum without compromising signal-to-noise ratio or spatial resolution. Notably, the PEG-doped resin reduced charging at voltages above the typical threshold for undoped resins, which show artifacts above 1.0 keV. Though some charging persisted in lung tissue at 2.0 keV, near-complete mitigation was achieved at slightly lower voltages.

To bridge this gap, a bioengineered dentin-like construct has recently been developed as a reproducible and accessible model for studying biofilm formation associated with dental aging. Therefore, this study aimed to assess dual-species Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans biofilm formation on bioengineered dentin substrates and compare it to biofilm formation on natural human aged dentin. For this, S. mutans UA159 and C. albicans (ATCC 90028) were co-cultured on bioengineered and natural dentin slabs, and polymicrobial biofilm formation and EPS production were characterized via high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy. Following biofilm formation, image processing was conducted using COMSTAT software to determine biofilm growth parameters. Additionally, fluorescence intensity was quantified via microplate readings, and cell viability was assessed using a Live/Dead viability kit. Overall, results showed similar biofilm formation patterns between the bioengineered and aged dentin, with no significant differences found in biofilm physical properties or viability.

To dissect the genomic and transcriptional architecture of a cohort of spinal cord DMG patients, we conducted whole-exome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing on 19 tumor samples from 7 patients. We identified previously underappreciated stem-like cells associated with hypoxia in malignant tumor cells, which were present in all samples of spinal cord DMG but absent in published intracranial DMG, corroborating cellular heterogeneity based on tumor location. We discovered that tumor-associated myeloid cells constituted the largest population of non-malignant cells in adult spinal cord DMG. Our research revealed a transition from microglia to macrophages, characterized by enhanced cell-to-cell interactions mediated through the VEGF signaling pathway network. Notably, we found that epigenetic agents can repress the expression of hypoxia-related gene programs in patient-derived spinal cord DMG cultures and inhibit cell proliferation in vitro.

This fundamental question is particularly relevant for modern neuroscience, as large-scale electron microscopy now enables the reconstruction of neural circuits at single-synapse resolution across many organisms. To interpret circuit function from such datasets, we must understand the extent to which [measured] structure constrains dynamics. We investigate this question in the drosophila head direction (HD) circuit, which maintains an internal heading estimate through attractor dynamics that integrate self-motion velocity cues. This circuit serves as a sensitive assay for functional specification: continuous attractor networks are theoretically known to require finely tuned wiring, whereas connectomes reveal that biological wiring can be variable and omit key cellular parameters such as synaptic gains, neuronal thresholds, and time constants. We introduce a method that combines self-supervised and unsupervised learning objectives to estimate unknown parameters at the level of cell types, rather than individual neurons and synapses. Given the raw connectivity matrix, our approach recovers a network that robustly exhibits continuous attractor dynamics and accurately integrates a range of velocity inputs, despite minimal parameter tuning on a connectome which notably departs from the symmetric regularity of an idealized ring attractor.

Recent studies suggest that, through statistical learning, prior experiences regarding distractor locations can reduce distraction by suppressing their corresponding locations. However, the proactive neural mechanisms supporting this learned suppression remain unclear. Our findings demonstrate that participants learn to suppress locations that are more likely to contain distractors relative to other locations. Using frequency tagging in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, we observed significantly different tagging responses between high- and low-probability locations, along with a general decrease in alpha power (8-12 Hz) prior to search onset. Notably, the higher tagging frequency power at high-probability locations suggests that participants allocated greater attentional focus to these locations in anticipation of the search. These results suggest that anticipatory attentional deployment precedes the suppression of high-probability distractor locations after the onset of visual search.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

L.; Milton, F.; Fulford, J.; Tan, J. B.; O'Callaghan, C.; Zeman, A.; Shine, J.", "abstract": "Aphantasia is the inability to experience mental imagery in full wakefulness without any prominent perceptual deficits. Visual aphantasia is associated with differences in distributed brain networks, but its neurobiological underpinnings remain a mystery. We rationalised that aphantasia may arise due to impairments in the top-down control over visual imagination. We expected that this in turn would prevent the brains of aphantasic subjects from differentiating neural activity encoding the contents of imagination from the background noise of resting activity, particularly within the ventral temporal lobes. To test this hypothesis, we re-analysed functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected from aphantasics (n = 23) and controls (n = 20) during a simple perception and imagery task. We used two measures of informational complexity to quantify the complexity of the spatial pattern of thresholded BOLD signal in the participants' temporal lobes during visual imagery. This spatial complexity was lower in aphantasics than controls during blocks of imagery, but not during perception (P < 0.05). We then performed dynamic functional connectivity analyses on the same data to demonstrate that the higher-order networks of aphantasics coupled abnormally with the temporal lobes during imagery (P < 0.05). These results provide a novel perspective, reframing aphantasia as an inability of the visual system to selectively activate regions encoding object-specific visual categories above background levels of noise.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

N.; Gonzalez-Garcia, C.", "abstract": "Visual inputs during natural perception are highly ambiguous: objects are frequently occluded, lighting conditions vary, and object identification depends significantly on prior experiences. However, why do certain images remain unidentifiable while others can be recognized immediately, and what visual features drive subjective clarification? To address these critical questions, we developed a unique dataset of 1,854 ambiguous images and collected more than 100,000 participant ratings evaluating their identifiability before and after seeing undistorted versions of the images. Relating the representations of a brain-inspired neural network model in response to our images with human ratings, we show that subjective identification depends largely on the extent to which higher-level visual features from the original images are preserved in their ambiguous counterparts. Notably, the predominance of higher-level features over lower-level ones softens after participants disambiguate the images. In line with these results, an image-level regression analysis showed that the subjective identification of ambiguous images was best explained by high-level visual dimensions. Moreover, we found that the process of ambiguity resolution was accompanied by a notable decrease in semantic distance and a greater consistency in object naming among participants. However, the relationship between information gained after disambiguation and subjective identification was non-linear, indicating that acquiring more information does not necessarily enhance subjective clarity. Instead, we observed a U-shaped relationship, suggesting that subjective identification improves when the acquired information either strongly matches or mismatches prior predictions. Collectively, these findings highlight fundamental principles underlying the mapping between human visual perception and memory, advancing our understanding on how we resolve ambiguity and extract meaning from incomplete visual information.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Despite the promise of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs), their narrow margin between efficacy and residual virulence presents major safety challenges. This study bridges a critical knowledge gap in ASF vaccinology by identifying innate and adaptive correlates of protection. This was achieved by using an established model with two groups of pigs differing in baseline immunological status (farm and specific pathogen-free [SPF]). The animals were immunized with an attenuated ASFV strain and subsequently challenged with a related, highly virulent genotype II strain. By applying a systems immunology approach, we correlated kinetic data, including serum cytokines, blood transcription modules (BTMs), T-cell responses, and antibody levels, with clinical outcomes to track protective and detrimental immune responses to the virus over time. Key innate correlates of protection included early and sustained IFN- response, activation of antigen presentation BTMs, and controlled IL-8 levels during immunization. Lower baseline immune activation was linked to increased protective immunity. Adaptive correlates encompassed cell cycle, plasma cell, and T cell activation BTM responses lasting until day 15 post-immunization. Consequently, an effective response from ASFV-specific Th cells prior to challenge predicted protection. After the challenge, an early IFN- response, along with low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a strong induction of memory Th and Tc cells, correlated with improved clinical outcomes. The model highlights the critical role of host-specific factors in vaccine efficacy and provides a valuable framework for optimizing ASFV vaccine design while distinguishing between protective and detrimental immune responses.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

D.; Lundquist, E. A.", "abstract": "Hox transcription factors are involved in neuronal and neural crest development and differentiation, including migration, but the genetic programs employed by Hox genes to regulate terminal differentiation remain to be defined. In C. elegans, the Antennapedia-like Hox factor MAB-5 is both necessary and sufficient to induce posterior migration of the Q lineage neuroblasts and neurons downstream of canonical Wnt signaling. Q lineage fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA seq in mab-5 loss-of-function and gain-of-function backgrounds revealed genes with expression in the Q lineage dependent upon MAB-5. Here, the roles of three mab-5 target genes in QL lineage posterior migration are delineated, vab-8/KIF26, lin-17/Fz, and efn-4/Ephrin. First, live, time-lapse imaging of QL.a and QL.ap posterior migration revealed that this migration occurs in three distinct stages: QL.a migration posterior to QL.p; after QL.a division, posterior migration of QL.ap to a region immediately anterior to the anus; and final migration of QL.ap posterior to the anus to the final position where it differentiates into the PQR neuron. vab-8 affected each of the three stages, lin-17 affected stages two and three, and efn-4 was required for the third stage of posterior QL.ap migration. Thus, different MAB-5 target genes control distinct stages of posterior migration. mab-20/Semaphorin, a known interaction partner with efn-4, also affected only the third stage similar to efn-4. Suppression of mab-5 gof posterior migration confirmed that these genes act downstream of mab-5 in posterior migration. Possibly, VAB-8/KIF26 trafficks distinct molecules to the plasma membrane that mediate distinct stages of migration, including LIN-17/Fz and EFN-4. Surpisingly, failure of stages two and three led to the premature extension of a posterior dendritic protrusion, which normally forms after QL.ap had migrated to its final position and PQR differentiation begins. This suggests a link between migration and differentiation, where differentiation is delayed while migration proceeds. In sum, this works delineates a transcriptional program downstream of mab-5/Hox that controls posterior neuroblast migration, in response to Wnt signaling.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

However, it remains uncertain how plant interactions are affected by such encroachment due to the lack of long-term observational data. Here, we reconstruct plant composition and functional trait turnover during post-glacial woody encroachment using sedimentary ancient DNA from nine lakes in the Siberia-Alaska region. Environmentally constrained null models are applied to partition plant interactions from the pure environment driven plant co-occurrence signal. Our results show that plant interactions shifted from predominantly positive interactions (e.g. nurse-plant facilitation) during the glacial period to negative interactions (e.g. competition) during the Holocene. This shift coincided with a community transition from herbaceous to woody taxa, leading to an increase in average plant height and root length, as evidenced by leveraging plant trait information. We suggest that climate (an external factor) and plant interactions (an internal process) jointly supported rapid and widespread woody taxa expansion at the end of the last glacial, which may provide an analogy with contemporary \"arctic greening\". In turn, woody encroachment is likely to constrain the geographical ranges of native species, increasing the risk of local native taxa loss, while enhancing beta diversity.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

The arrival of non-indigenous fish is exacerbated by the Suez Canal that allows Indo-Pacific species to enter the region from the Red Sea. While some non-indigenous species (NIS) have already changed the composition and function of native Mediterranean communities, many others continue to arrive but often go unnoticed without regular surveys or until they are strongly established. We conducted biodiversity surveys using underwater visual census (UVC), aqueous environmental DNA (eDNA) and sponge-derived eDNA (i.e., eDNA accumulated in sea sponge tissue) at two protected locations in Zakynthos, Greece. Seven NIS were detected by eDNA, but only one (dusky spinefoot, Siganus luridus) was detected with all three methods. The fish assemblages of the two locations could be distinguished based on both UVC and eDNA but not from sponge-derived eDNA data, perhaps given low filtration rates. Of the three methods, aqueous eDNA metabarcoding provided the most comprehensive species list including new NIS detected (with the red-toothed triggerfish, Odonus niger, and the houndfish, Tylosurus crocodilus, being the first and third record in the Mediterranean Sea, respectively).

While single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled comprehensive profiling of millions of cells in aged tissues, reliable identification of senescent cells remains challenging due to the weak and non-specific expression of marker genes. Although existing computational methods could be used to detect active cell states through gene set scoring approaches, their performance with senescence genes has not been rigorously assessed. In this study, we showed that senescence genes display weak, non-specific expression patterns across different tissues and are susceptible to dropout events in scRNA-seq. Current scoring approaches suffered intrinsic limitations in single-cell detection using weakly expressed markers. Simply expanding the gene set of weak markers failed to improve detection accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we developed ICE (Iterative-imputation-based Cell Enrichment), a computational framework that combines expression imputation with iterative marker refinement. ICE achieved a remarkable improvement in detection precision when analyzing pancreatic  cells with weakly expressed markers, by increasing accuracy from 56% to 98%. Applied to senescence markers (CDKN1A/p21, CDKN2A/p16, ATF3, and MX1), ICE successfully identified marker-specific cell populations, including stressed {beta} cells in aging and type-I interferon-responsive microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Incorporation of 10 mol% cone-shaped poly(ethylene glycol)-lipid (PEG-lipid) to DOTAP-containing CLs transitions a fraction of the particles to micellar nanodiscs. These PTX--loaded PEGylated CLs and nanodiscs show enhanced cellular uptake in vitro and improved tumor penetration and proapoptotic activity compared to bare CLs in an in vivo solid breast cancer tumor model. Formulations incorporating the multivalent cationic lipid MVL5 (+5e) at 50 mol% form nanoparticles (NPs) comprised almost entirely of nanodiscs, and transition at 75 mol% MVL5 to short micellar rods coexisting with spheres, with rods further transitioning to long flexible rods upon PEGylation. Here, we report on the finding that MVL5-based micellar NPs with disc, rod, and spherical morphologies dramatically improve the solubility of PTX in their fluid lipid membranes by nearly three-fold compared to reference CLs modeled on the EndoTAG-1TM formulation. Cell viability assays revealed that this improved PTX solubility for MVL5 micellar NPs leads to improved cytotoxic efficacy, which is further improved by PEGylation. Remarkably, using fluorescent microscopy and image particle analysis, we find that the cellular uptake and penetration depth of MVL5 nanoparticles is significantly improved by PEGylation. The findings are consistent with a model where the rate-limiting step of PTX delivery by cationic lipid NPs is diffusion of endocytic vesicles containing NPs through the actin mesh near the cell surface combined with the hoping rate of PTX from endosomal membrane to nearby microtubules. PEGylated cationic lipid nanoparticles containing MVL5 therefore represent a very promising hydrophobic cancer drug delivery vehicle for nanomedicine applications.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

As rising temperatures accelerate crop development, it is necessary to adjust the rotation order and sowing dates of crops in a rotation system. Such an adjustment can enhance agricultural productivity at the whole rotation system level even under warmer conditions. Here, we present a computational approach to identify the crop rotation calendar (the order and sowing dates of rotation crops) that maximizes total crop output with available climatic resources. In this study, the rotation order indicates the cyclical sequence of crop species without intercropping, cover crop and fallow. This approach involves two steps: (1) generating crop windows (the timing and length of crop duration from sowing to harvest) and corresponding outputs (production per unit land area per harvest) for the rotation crops using a crop growth model with daily weather inputs; and (2) applying an optimization algorithm to identify a single subset of crop windows of rotation crops that maximizes the total crop output while satisfying agronomic constraints. We applied this method to a four-year, four-crop rotation system in northern Japan, with historical and projected climates from 2000 to 2100. The results revealed that adjusting crop windows would reduce the time to complete all rotation crops in the system (shortened rotation cycle) and enhance the system-level annual productivity [kgDW ha-1 year-1] with time. The increase in this productivity is approximately 0.5 % per year under high warming of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5. Optimizing the rotation order in addition to the rotation crops sowing dates showed the changes in the most productive rotation orders, demonstrating the dynamic nature of rotation planning under climate change.

W.; Leyser, O.", "abstract": "As part of their modular development, plants continuously adapt their shoot branching architecture according to environmental conditions. This occurs by regulating the activity of axillary buds established in each leaf axil. Whether a bud grows into a shoot depends partly on the presence of other active shoots, which can inhibit bud activation. This systemic coordination is proposed to be mediated by the transport network of the plant hormone auxin, with buds competing to establish sustained transport of auxin, termed canalised auxin transport, into the main stem. A second hormone, strigolactone, tunes this competition by influencing the removal of the PIN1 auxin export protein from the plasma membrane, and hence the dynamics of canalisation. Strigolactone also regulates the expression of another key regulatory hub, the bud-expressed transcription factor BRANCHED1 (BRC1). The interplay between auxin transport and BRC1 in regulating bud activity is poorly understood. Here, we investigate this interplay in the context of competition between buds, using Arabidopsis explants with two axillary buds as a minimal system. Using experimental data, we develop a mathematical model of bud-bud competition in which BRC1 influences the establishment of canalised auxin transport by regulating the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. We identify single model parameters that plausibly correspond to the dual impact of strigolactone on BRC1 expression and PIN1. We show that modulating these two parameters reproduces the dynamics of bud growth and bud-bud competition observed in relevant mutants and treatments. Our model produces testable hypotheses, which we validate by generating a chimeric PIN1 auxin transporter with impaired strigolactone sensitivity, helping us uncouple the effects of strigolactone on PIN1 and BRC1. These results support the hypothesis that BRC1 influences local bud competitiveness by tuning the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. Together with the systemic feedbacks in the auxin transport network, this enables plants to adjust dynamically the number and location of growing branches.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Inference provides a means of deriving quantitative, mechanistic insights from sparse, noisy data. While methods for parameter inference, parameter identifiability, and model prediction are well-developed for deterministic continuum models, working with biological applications often requires stochastic modelling approaches to capture inherent variability and randomness that can be prominent in biological measurements and data. Random walk models are especially useful for capturing spatiotemporal processes, such as ecological population dynamics, molecular transport phenomena, and collective behaviour associated with multicellular phenomena. This article focuses on parameter inference, identifiability analysis, and model prediction for a suite of biologically-inspired random walk models. With a particular emphasis on model prediction, we highlight roles for numerical optimisation and automatic differentiation. Open-source Julia code is provided to support scientific reproducibility.

However, even a single gene perturbation can cause global changes in gene expression profiles. Consequently, predicting which genes will be affected by a particular genetic perturbation remains a challenge. Here, we analyze changes in genome-wide gene expression profiles caused by single-gene perturbations in bacterial, worm, and human cells and show a simple rule that genes that intrinsically maintain the ratio of expression levels (stoichiometry) with a perturbed gene are more likely to be affected when it is deleted or inactivated. Furthermore, deleting a gene that maintains their stoichiometry with more genes tend to affect the expression levels of other genes genome-wide. Stoichiometry-conserving gene clusters can be found beyond local transcriptional regulatory units and metabolic pathways. Thus, the effects of genetic perturbations are propagated to other genes through a multi-level stoichiometry-conserving architecture in cells.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

L.; Varlet, M.; Grootswagers, T.", "abstract": "Fast and accurate object recognition is crucial for effective behaviour in dynamic visual environments. In some cases, the visual system must overcome ambiguity in visual input during object recognition, such as when an object is partially hidden behind another. Recurrent processing between higher- and lower-order areas is thought to play a role in resolving such ambiguity, enabling the filling in of missing visual information. Here we examined this claim using a novel paradigm in which partial object images appear 'occluded' by an illusory Kanizsa figure, perception of which also depends on recurrent processing by the grouping of Pacmen inducers. If both recognising the partial object and perceiving the illusory shape depend on recurrent processing, object recognition should vary as a function of the presence of illusory shape. Across two behavioural experiments and a separate EEG decoding study, we found no evidence for an interaction between illusion perception and object recognition, and different neural time courses for the illusory figures alone compared to those of the partial objects, which were decoded earlier. Ultimately, our study highlights the robustness of the visual system to solve the identity of the ambiguous object, independently from the processing of different ambiguities occurring at the same time, providing new insights into the mechanisms of recurrence in the early and late stages of information processing and its application to ambiguous object recognition.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

These case studies suggest that autoimmunity against Sez6L2 causes cerebellar damage leading to ataxia. Sez6L2 is a transmembrane protein expressed by most neurons, with the highest levels in the cerebellum. We tested whether immunizing C57BL/6 mice against Sez6L2 could produce an autoimmune response resulting in ataxia symptoms and immune attack on the brain/cerebellum. We found that immunized mice generated significant levels of anti-Sez6L2 antibodies, with IgGs present in the cerebellar parenchyma. Additionally, Sez6L2-immunized mice developed a significant population of Sez6L2-specific T cells targeting two immunodominant epitopes and showed increased CD4+ T cell infiltration into the brain. These mice exhibited mild mobility impairments in open field, wire grid walk, and pole test assays. Our results indicate that an autoimmune response to Sez6L2 in mice can lead to mobility impairments and pathology consistent with human cerebellar ataxia associated with Sez6L2 autoantibodies.

However, the mechanisms that sustain long-term synaptic stabilization are not well understood. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are lattice-like extracellular matrix structures that enwrap neurons, are thought to stabilize synapses. However, the mechanisms regulating their formation remain unclear. Here, we found that neuronal activity induces transcription of aggrecan, a core PNN component, which in turn promotes PNN assembly. In primary cultured mouse cortical neurons, pharmacological stimulation of neuronal activity robustly increased aggrecan expression, whereas activity blockade suppressed it. Among the PNN-related genes examined, aggrecan alone exhibited strong activity-dependent transcriptional regulation. Analysis of published in vivo datasets revealed selective upregulation of aggrecan in parvalbumin-positive interneurons following sensory stimulation. This regulation required calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels and was dependent on cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling and chromatin remodeling. These findings reveal a novel molecular link between neuronal activity and PNN formation, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying the long-term stabilization of neural circuits.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

H3K4me2 in plants is correlated with transcriptionally repressed states, which can be accounted for by transcription-coupled active H3K4me2 demethylation, but the converse molecular pathway by which H3K4me2 represses transcription remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that H3K4me2 colocalizes with the facultatively repressive marks H2A.Z, H2A ubiquitination (H2Aub), and H3K27me3 in the gene body. Our genetic analyses reveal that H3K4me2 functions upstream but not downstream of these repressive marks. Interestingly, in genes with diurnal H3K4me2 oscillation, H3K4me2 oscillates in antiphase with transcription but in phase with H2A.Z. In addition, the genetic manipulation of H3K4me2 affects the oscillating profiles of H2A.Z, suggesting the efficient relay from H3K4me2 to H2A.Z. Notably, the diurnal oscillation of H2Aub is much weaker than that of H2A.Z despite the overall similarity in their distributions.

We therefore investigated whether Caspase-8 may sustain DNA repair pathways proficiency in GBM. Here we uncover a novel role of Caspase-8 as promoter of the Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR).

While the main signaling pathways, transcription factors, and the genes eliciting the terminal phenotypes are known, how information flows from a few regulators to thousands of genes to change the state of the cell remains to be fleshed out. To profile this information transfer process, we sampled the differentiation of the PUER myeloid cell line into macrophages and neutrophils at 29 time points over seven days. There is extensive transient regulation; the number of transcripts modulated in time is twice the number differentially expressed between endpoints. Differentiation is marked by two sharp transitions, at ~8h and ~80h, when transcriptomic state changes suddenly. We utilized non-negative matrix factorization to identify behaviors, characteristic temporal patterns of gene expression, and to classify transcripts by behavior. Only 10 distinct behaviors are sufficient to recapitulate the expression of ~36,000 transcripts with high fidelity. Gene expression in most of the behaviors occurs in pulses of varying initiation times and durations. This implies that information transfer during differentiation occurs in cascading waves of gene expression culminating in the permanent turning on of certain genes after ~80h. Each behavior is enriched in specific biological processes, so that physiological remodeling proceeds in a characteristic order--signal transduction, translation and mRNA processing, metabolism, and, ultimately, myeloid phenotypic processes. The sharp transition at 8h corresponds to the completion of transcriptional and translational remodeling and the initiation of metabolic remodeling; the one at 80h corresponds to the elicitation of myeloid phenotypes. Our analysis shows that differentiation relies upon a series of transient, rapid, and complex gene regulatory events and highlights the importance of profiling it at a high temporal resolution.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated two GNAT (Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase) family homologs, pat1 and pat2, in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii (Hv). We found that a pat2 mutant exhibited impaired growth and premature cell death on glycerol, a phenotype not observed in the parent strain, pat1 mutant, or during growth on glucose. Complementation with plasmid-expressed pat2 restored growth on glycerol, confirming this biological role. In vitro assays demonstrated that HvPat2 catalyzes the lysine acetylation of HvGlpK, a glycerol kinase essential for glycerol metabolism. Computational modeling predicted that HvPat2 residues E105, Y154, V110, and N147 may form hydrogen bonds with acetyl-CoA. To assess the functional importance of these residues, alanine substitutions were introduced at each site. Growth assays revealed that E105A and Y154A variants failed to restore growth on glycerol, while V110A and N147A had no significant effect. In vitro, HvPat2 Y154A, E105A, and V110A lacked acetyltransferase activity toward GlpK, whereas N147A retained partial activity. HvPat2 Y154A co-purified with a protein partner, potentially explaining the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro results.

Here, we present an experimental genetics characterization of GEP1 in the human pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing we generated PfGEP1 loss-of-function lines and analyzed their progression until gametocyte maturation. We show a complete defect in both male and female gametogenesis caused by disruption of PfGEP1. Pfgep1(-) gametocytes do not produce gametes when activated with xanthurenic acid or a drop in temperature. This defect could not be overcome by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Zaprinast, which induces gametogenesis.

Nevertheless, identifying clear rational design principles remains challenging because the action of these molecules cannot be understood as common noncovalent inhibitors. Conventional kinetic models often reduce the binding of covalent inhibitors to a two-step irreversible process, overlooking rapid complex dynamics of the associated unlinked inhibitor before the formation of the covalent bond with its target. In the present analysis, we expand the intermediate state into two conformations---reactive (E{middle dot}I) and nonreactive (E{middle dot}{middle dot}I). To illustrate the consequences of such simplification, the expanded kinetic model can be reduced to an effective two-step scheme expressed in terms of the equilibrium probability of the unlinked inhibitor to form either conformation. A mass-action-based numerical workflow is implemented to simulate time-dependent kinetics, overcoming the common limitations of empirical models. The numerical workflow helps relate microscopic states observed in molecular dynamics simulations to macroscopic observables like EC50 and the apparent rate of covalent inhibition, showing the impact of transient intermediates on dissociation rates and potency.

A long sperm morph, the \"eusperm\" is fertile, whereas shorter sperm morphs, the \"parasperm\", are non-fertilising and protect the eusperm within the female reproductive tract. Many studies over the past 55 years have measured sperm length of eusperm and parasperm in obscura species. One recent study found that D. pseudoobscura produces three sperm morphs, two parasperm and one eusperm, in contrast to the two morphs described in older studies of this species. Thus, the number of morphs made by some species in this clade is still in dispute. Here, we review sperm length data from previous studies and re-measure sperm of eight species including D. pseudoobscura. We used two statistical cluster analysis approaches to identify sperm morphs based on sperm and nucleus length, to test whether multiple parasperm morphs are present in more species than previously identified.

Swim bladder deflation impairs this postural recovery, suggesting its critical role. This static posture control strategy may be utilized by many fish species. However, adult fish differ from larvae in morphology and behavior, raising questions about the generality of this mechanism.

However, clinical trials have indicated modest monotherapy activity of AURKA inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that AURKA inhibition promotes phosphorylation of Replication Protein A (RPA), resulting in stalled DNA replication fork progression and eliciting a replication stress response in multiple TP53-mutated models, creating a druggable dependence on the mitotic checkpoint kinase WEE1. Combined inhibition of AURKA and WEE1 synergistically enhanced replication stress, tumor-specific apoptotic cell death, and mitotic catastrophe, and led to marked tumor regression in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models of TP53-mutated cancer. Our findings define enhanced DNA replication stress as underlying the strong synergy between AURKA and WEE1 inhibitors and offer preclinical confirmation of efficacy, indicating high potential for clinical translation of this synthetic lethal strategy for TP53-mutated carcinomas.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

The full extent of protein dysfunctions in AD and their impact on cellular physiology remains unknown. Here, we used plexDIA, an approach that parallelizes the acquisition of samples and peptides, to characterize proteomic changes in AD. Using human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue, we identified 281 differentially abundant proteins in AD. By systematically analyzing cellular compartment-specific shifts in protein abundance, we identified an AD-specific decrease in levels of the 20S proteasome, the catalytic core of the cell's primary protein degradation pathway. This alteration was accompanied by widespread decreases in proteasome subunit stoichiometries. Many proteasome substrate proteins were negatively correlated with 20S levels and increased in AD, suggesting that reduced 20S levels leads to abnormal protein accumulation. By analyzing proteins increased in AD, we identify key properties of such proteins. Namely, they have highly specific subcellular localizations and fast degradation rates, they contain signal sequences that allow them to be targeted for proteasomal degradation, and they are targeted by quality control pathways that recognize mislocalized proteins. Furthermore, we identify coherent sets of ubiquitin system enzymes, proteins that target substrates for proteasomal degradation, whose levels robustly discriminate AD from non-AD samples. One subset exhibited consistent increases in AD, while another exhibited consistent decreases, revealing complex alterations to the ubiquitin system in AD. Taken together, our results suggest that decreased ubiquitin-proteasome system capacity and impaired clearance of short-lived and mislocalized proteins contribute substantially to proteopathic burden in AD.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

However, experimentally and computationally distinguishing residues that maintain structural integrity from those directly involved in enzymatic function remains a major challenge. In this study, we developed a methodology to identify amino acid residues that influence substrate specificity in enzymes with homologous structures. We framed the sequence comparison as a classification problem, treating each residue as a feature, thereby enabling the rapid and objective identification of key residues responsible for functional differences. To validate the proposed method, we applied it to three enzyme pairs - trypsin/chymotrypsin, adenylyl cyclase/guanylyl cyclase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/malate dehydrogenase (MDH). The results confirmed the accurate prediction of previously identified specificity-determining residues. Furthermore, we conducted experiments on the LDH/MDH pair and successfully introduced mutations into key residues to alter substrate specificity, enabling LDH to utilize oxaloacetate while maintaining its expression levels. These findings demonstrate the potential of this method for efficiently identifying residues that govern substrate specificity. We have further developed this approach into a practical tool, the EZSCAN: Enzyme Substrate-specificity and Conservation Analysis Navigator (https://ezscan.pe-tools.com/), which enables rapid identification of amino acid residues critical for enzyme function.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined the photo-induced reaction dynamics of OCP using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and transient grating (TG) spectroscopy. We found that OCPO and OCPR exist in monomer-dimer equilibria, with OCPR forming more stable and elongated dimers. TG measurements revealed that upon photoexcitation, OCPO monomers undergo two structural transitions before associating into OCPR dimers. In contrast, OCPO dimers dissociate prior to the structural rearrangement, highlighting a fundamental difference in their reaction pathways. Moreover, dimerization was found to moderately reduce the photo-reactivity of OCPO compared to the monomer.

This approach, known as de novo protein sequencing, is essential for applications such as antibody sequencing, microbiome proteomics, and antigen discovery, which require accurate reconstruction of peptide and protein sequences. While trypsin remains the gold-standard protease in proteomics, its restricted cleavage specificity limits peptide diversity. This constraint is especially problematic in antibody sequencing, where the functionally critical regions often lack canonical tryptic sites. As a result, exclusively trypsin-based approaches yield sparse reads, leading to sequence gaps. Multi-protease and hybrid-fragmentation strategies can improve the sequence coverage, but they add complexity, compromise scalability and reproducibility. Here, we explore two HyperThermoacidic Archaeal (HTA)-proteases as single-enzyme solutions for de novo antibody sequencing. Each HTA-protease generated about five times more unique peptide reads than trypsin or chymotrypsin, providing high redundancy across all CDRs. Combined with EAciD fragmentation on a ZenoTOF 7600 system, this approach enabled complete, unambiguous antibody sequencing. De novo analysis using PEAKS/DeepNovo and Stitch showed up to fourfold higher alignment scores and reduced the sequence errors within the HTA-generated data. Additionally, the HTA-EAciD approach offers short digestion times, eliminates extensive cleanup, and enables analysis in a single LC-MS/MS run. This streamlined, single-protease approach delivers therefore performance comparable to multi-enzyme workflows, offering a scalable and efficient strategy for de novo protein sequencing across diverse applications.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Recent structural coverage has provided important insights into their activation and signaling, however, confounding observations in the literature related to ligand efficacy and functional responses, especially in different model systems, present a major challenge for drug discovery efforts. Here, we systematically and comprehensively profile a broad set of natural and synthetic ligands at C3aR and C5aR1 and discover a previously unanticipated level of functional specialization in terms of species-specific pharmacology and receptor activation. Taking a lead from this, we determine seventeen cryo-EM structures of different ligand-receptor-G-protein complexes and uncover distinct orientation of agonists between the human and mouse receptors despite an overlapping positioning in the orthosteric binding pocket. Combined with extensive mutagenesis and functional assays, these structural snapshots allow us to decode and validate a convergent molecular mechanism involving a \"Five-Point-Switch\" in these receptors that orchestrates the recognition and efficacy of diverse agonists. We also identify species-specific differences at the level of phosphorylation patterns encoded in the carboxyl-terminus of these receptors and directly visualize their impact on {beta}arr binding and activation using cryo-EM structures.

Then, the gene was transferred to the seeds via pollination, and after the seeds were sown, gene expression was observed at the roots of the seedlings.

We conducted an original study to better understand the respective roles of propionic acid, its conjugate base propionate and pH in the AD inhibition, and to identify potential inhibition biomarkers for an early warning. We focused on both methane production and microbial community composition, during the digestion of wastewater treatment sludge. A partial decrease in methane production was detected with the addition of 13 mM of propionic acid (1,000 mg.L-1), while total inhibition occurred for 81 mM (6,000 mg.L-1). Comparisons with the effects of adding sodium propionate, sodium chloride, and lowering the pH indicated that this inhibition was largely attributed to the H+ counter-ion. In particular, only moderate inhibition was observed when adding sodium propionate at a concentration of 81 mM. The composition of the microbial communities was significantly modified in the presence of propionate, with this adaptation specifically depending on the nature and concentration of the compound added, more precisely of the counterion. Various functional groups were affected, including syntrophs and methanogenic archaea. The relative abundance of the latter decreased significantly in the presence of propionic acid, consistent with the negative effects observed on the methane production rate, and with previous studies. Several microbial groups highly sensitive to propionic acid were identified in both our tests, in particular the family ST-12K33 (order Sphingobacteriales), which emerged as a strong biomarker candidate.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Using time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy, we identified distinct motility cycles characterized by elongation, contraction, and retraction phases. On soft substrates, cells exhibited slower retraction speeds and longer motility cycles compared to those on hard substrates. Notably, cells on soft substrates left trailing edges upon retraction, leading to pronounced morphological oscillations, whereas cells on hard substrates adopted near-circular shapes with less coordinated motility. Quantitative analyses revealed that the duration of the static phase was significantly shorter on hard substrates, correlating with differences in cell shape parameters, including length, circularity, and area.

DNA binding by TOP1 might affect its interaction with ATAs. Therefore, we studied the effect of DNA binding by TOP1 on ATA recognition. Methods ATA monoclonal antibodies (ATA mAbs) were generated from patient-derived TOP1-reactive B cells. Reactivity of ATA mAbs and antibodies in patient plasma towards TOP1 and TOP1-DNA cleavage complexes (TOP1cc) was determined by ELISA and mass photometry. Immunostimulatory properties of ATA mAbs in complex with TOP1/TOP1cc were assessed by stimulation of monocytic THP-1 cells. Results DNA binding by TOP1 differentially affected the recognition of TOP1 by ATA mAbs. A subset of mAbs showed enhanced binding to TOP1cc, whereas others recognized TOP1 and TOP1cc to a similar extent. ATAs with enhanced TOP1cc recognition were observed in plasma of ATA+ SSc patients and correlated with ATA levels and interstitial lung disease. These TOP1cc-enhanced ATAs variably affected the enzymatic function of TOP1 and circulated predominantly as IgG1 and IgM.

To mitigate their presence, non-lethal control strategies such as vegetation clearing in peri-urban parks and wastelands are being implemented to reduce the number of suitable resting sites. However, the ecological consequences of such habitat modifications on other wildlife species remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap limits the development of effective urban wildlife management strategies that seeks to balance ecological, social and economic considerations without harming wild boar populations and urban ecosystems. In this context, we used camera trapping to study the covariation between wild boars and other mammal species in a peri-urban area, with the aim of guiding targeted and effective management strategies. Here, we show a widespread presence of wild boars but no spatial or temporal covariation between the wild boars and the other species. In contrast, we found strong spatial structuring in mammal communities, primarily driven by small carnivores (mustelids, genets, cats, foxes) and a minimal influence of temporal variation, confirming that spatial factors, rather than seasonal changes, largely shaped species distributions. The study of the temporal variation across months indicated minimal seasonal structuring but revealed substantial within-site variability in month-to-month species abundance, with a general abundance gradient driven by common species like wild boar, cat, and fox.

Inceptor (encoded by the gene ELAPOR1) is a recently discovered regulator of the insulin pathway that interacts with proinsulin, insulin, the Insulin receptor (Insr), and the Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r). Inceptor functions within pancreatic {beta}-cells, where it promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis of Insr and directs cytoplasmic insulin and proinsulin to lysosomal degradation. Using a comprehensive dataset of mammalian sequences, we tested for positive selection in the genes Ins, Insr, Igf1r, and ELAPOR1 using maximum likelihood models. Significant signals of positive selection were detected in hystricognath rodents for Ins, Insr, and ELAPOR1, but not for Igf1r. In Ins, positively selected sites were concentrated in the second binding site and in regions involved in hexamer formation, along with an additional site in the C-peptide. In Insr, selected sites were primarily located in the ectodomain, particularly in regions that interact with the second binding site of the insulin molecule. In ELAPOR1, selected sites were concentrated in the signal peptide and at the boundary between the second cysteine-rich domain and the mannose 6-phosphate receptor region. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that natural selection has shaped multiple components of the insulin signaling pathway, contributing to the functional divergence observed in hystricognath rodents.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

While generally described as positively charged amphipathic helices, presequences lack a consensus motif and thus likely promote the import of proteins into mitochondria with variable efficiencies. Indeed, the concept of presequence \"strength\" critically underlies biological models such as stress sensing, yet a quantitative analysis of what dictates \"strong\" versus \"weak\" presequences is lacking. Furthermore, the extent to which presequence strength affects mitochondrial function and cellular fitness remains unclear. Here, we capitalize on the high-throughput and kinetic nature of the MitoLuc mitochondrial protein import assay to quantify multiple aspects of presequence strength. We find that select presequences, including those that regulate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), are sufficient to impart differential import efficiencies during mitochondrial uncoupling. Surprisingly, we find that presequences beyond those classically associated with stress signaling promote highly variable import efficiency in stressed and basal (i.e., non-stressed) conditions in vitro, suggesting that presequence strength may influence a broader array of processes than currently appreciated. We exploit this variability to demonstrate that only presequences that promote robust import in vitro can fully rescue defects in respiratory growth in Complex IV-deficient yeast, suggesting that presequence strength dictates metabolic potential. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that presequence strength can describe numerous metrics, such as total imported protein, maximal import velocity, or sensitivity to uncoupling, suggesting that the annotation of presequences as \"weak\" versus \"strong\" requires more nuanced characterization than is typically performed. Importantly, we find that such variability in presequence strength meaningfully affects cellular fitness in processes beyond stress signaling, suggesting that organisms may broadly exploit presequence strength to fine-tune mitochondrial import and thus organellar homeostasis.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Due to the loss of binding avidity, mFc requires significantly enhanced FcRn-binding affinity at pH 6.0, but retaining weak binding at neutral pH to achieve comparable serum half-life, making engineering such mFc variants highly challenging. Mainly by computational design approach, we created mFc mutants with diverse human FcRn-binding profiles, including two variants that exhibit 17- and 47-fold stronger FcRn binding at pH 6.0 (KD of 30.7 nM and 88 nM) compared to a baseline mFc, while maintaining greater than 213-fold weaker binding at pH 7.4 (KD of 6,549 nM and 39,150 nM).

Finding 100% identity over long evolutionary times is unexpected, but pioneering research in the human-mouse pairwise alignment uncovered something even more puzzling: these elements are not as rare as previously suspected, and their sizes are distributed as a power-law, a feature that cannot be explained by standard models of genome evolution where genome conservation is expected to decay exponentially over time. Despite the power-law behavior having been reported and investigated in a wide variety of biological and physical contexts, from cell-division to protein family evolution, why it appears in the size distribution of ultraconserved elements remains to be fully clarified. To address this question, we propose a model of DNA sequence evolution by mutations of arbitrary length based on a classical integro-differential equation that arises in various applications in biology. The model captures the ultraconserved size distribution observed in pairwise alignments between human and 40 other vertebrates, encompassing more than 400 million years of evolution, from chimpanzee to zebrafish.

We sought a rigorous way to define thresholds and evaluate the strength and consistency of association with the event of interest. We present {mt.surv}, an R package for multi-threshold survival analyses. The primary function performs a time-to-event analysis, where a continuous predictor variable is stratified into two groups at an arbitrary number of places, defined by the percentile of the distribution. The result can be visualized with a function that creates a custom line plot with the -log of a log-likelihood p-value against the threshold percentile. A third function operates on this plot and calculates the area above a significance threshold, creating a scalar that can be used to rank biological variables for their association with the event of interest. This framework can be broadly applied to any continuous predictor variable including, but not limited to, gene expression and microbial abundances. Several helper functions are included for structuring input data and job submission in a cluster framework. We found that this method has value in discovery-type analyses where one lacks prior information about appropriate stratification thresholds.

While precise, low-immunogenic treatments are essential for canine cancer care, traditional species conversion methods rely on ad hoc bioinformatics modifications. These methods often implicitly decouple the framework (FR) and complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), ignoring how structural changes in FRs can affect the conformation and function of CDRs. This can compromise binding specificity and require costly high-throughput in vitro screening. To address this, we present DoggifAI, a transformer model that translates non-canine antibody sequences into canine ones by generating species-appropriate framework regions (FRs) based on desired CDRs. This allows the model to better preserve structural compatibility between FRs and CDRs. The model is pretrained in a T5-style text-to-text denoising task on a large multispecies antibody dataset, which allows further finetuning on a much smaller species-specific dataset.

Even though all commitments were rated as significantly important by scientists from all career stages, implementation rates were notably low (< 25%). Lab members reported higher importance scores than group leaders, with large divergences indicating where group leaders may underestimate the potential impact on lab culture. Indeed, the overall implementation rate was correlated with importance score for group leaders, but not lab members. Strikingly, more than 95% of group leaders said they would consider implementing the handbook commitments.

Here, we report two preregistered tDCS experiments that tested 1) whether the previously observed visual search improvement could be boosted through stimulation over the allegedly more dominant right FEF and 2) whether tDCS-related visual search improvements might depend on search field size. To this end, in experiments one and two, N=29 and N=31 healthy participants performed a visual search task, in which they searched for an upside-down T amongst upright Ts and Ls within small or large search fields, before and during the application of anodal (excitatory) or sham (control) tDCS over the right or left FEF, respectively.

This paper clusters FOG data into manifestation- or motion-specific subtypes and encodes their detection strategies in feature masks. It is found that while motion-specific subtypes share a common detection strategy, manifestation-specific subtypes require distinct strategies. A feature-mask-based CNN is proposed to train general and subtype-specific models using waist-mounted 3D accelerometer data. Manifestation models exhibit enhanced generalizability across subtypes over a general model, boosting the overall average FOG sensitivity by 24.95% +/- 9.80 and non-FOG specificity by 18.29% +/- 8.71.

While most studies on the relationship between GBA mutations and PD have focused on neurons, evidence suggests that PD pathology promoted by GCase deficiency involves other cell types and, in particular, interactions between neuronal and glial cells. Here, we identify microglia as primary players undergoing significant alterations at early stages of the pathological processes triggered by a GCase impairment. Using both pharmacological and genetic mouse models of GCase deficiency, we observed microglial morphological, transcriptional and metabolic changes. Interestingly, these changes were associated with a cell-specific, significant reduction of microglial ATP levels. When microglial ATP depletion was reproduced in an in vitro system of co-cultured microglial and neuronal cells, the neuroprotective properties of microglia were compromised and neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress was enhanced. These findings underscore the role of microglia in PD pathogenesis and point to a pathogenetic mechanism by which microglial metabolic disturbances leading to ATP depletion enhance neuronal vulnerability to injury and neurodegeneration. This mechanism could be targeted for therapeutic intervention aimed at mitigating PD risk and counteracting the development of PD pathology.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

The OB initially processes and communicates perceived intensity to the PC via early gamma-band oscillations (bottom-up feedback). The PC then refines and sends this percept back to the OB via later beta-band oscillations (top-down feedback), updating the OB's gamma activity for subsequent odorants.

We observed that CAR T cells from patients who developed severe CRS displayed a higher expression of TCL6, HPCAL4, CCDC144B, and SIRPG, but lower levels of IL2, IL21, and HSPA1B when stimulated with anti-CAR19 idiotypic antibody in vitro. In addition, without stimulation, CAR T cells from CRS group showed a higher levels of IFNAR1, IL7R, ZNF69, and USP32P1 but lower levels of CCL3, IL4, IL17A, IL23R, IL13, CD70, and IFNGR2. These results provided insights to evaluate the adverse events of CAR T products before treatments, which could be beneficial for designing therapy plans.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

While model performances reported in the literature appear promising, no successful translation to the clinic has been reported. Results: We identify six primary obstacles to this: non-reproducible models, data leakage leading to poor generalization, pseudoreplication, biased evaluation metrics, missing ablation studies, and inconsistent viability data reducing comparability across models. Together, these issues lead to overly optimistic performance estimates of state-of-the-art models and make it challenging to track progress in the field. To address this, we present DrEval, a pipeline for unbiased and biologically meaningful evaluation of cancer drug response models. It includes baseline and literature models with consistent hyperparameter tuning, statistically sound evaluations, and cross-study benchmarks. DrEval enables ablation studies and publication-ready visualizations. It allows researchers to focus on model development without implementing their own evaluation protocol. We find that deep learning models barely outperform a naive model predicting the mean drug and cell line effects, while no complex model significantly outperforms properly tuned tree-based ensemble baselines in relevant settings. We advocate making our pipeline a standard benchmark for cancer drug response prediction, ensuring a clinically relevant and robust assessment. Availability and implementation: DrEval consists of a Python package, available on PyPI (drevalpy) and GitHub (github.com/daisybio/drevalpy), and an accompanying nf core pipeline (github.com/nf-core/drugresponseeval).

This continued SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution has necessitated annual vaccine updates to better match circulating viral variants. To optimize protection against emerging variants of interest and concern, a reliable means of predicting the immune escape of novel variants is needed to enable at-risk preparation of new vaccines. Herein, we describe the development and applications of a risk calculator that uses statistical modeling to predict the immune escape of emerging variants. The calculator utilizes previously published spike-antibody epitope and escape profiles and in vitro neutralization assessment of a large panel of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 variants evaluated against clinical sera. The calculator enables the grouping of antigenically related SARS-CoV-2 variants to guide strain selection for at-risk vaccine design and preparation, in anticipation of potential future requests by the global public health agencies.

While the disease is currently under control, the emergence of new coronavirus variants with pandemic potential underscores the need for more universal coronavirus vaccines. This study evaluates the immunogenicity in non-human primates of two broad-spectrum nasal vaccine candidates called PanCoV. The vaccine preparations are based on highly conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2, specifically the nucleocapsid (N) and the S2 subunit from Spike protein, which include several relevant T-cell epitopes and have the potential to form virus-like particles. PanCoV1 candidate contains the N protein, while the PanCoV2 comprises a chimeric protein containing the C-terminal domain of N protein fused to a fragment of S2 subunit. Both vaccine candidates also include the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from Spike protein and the ODN-39M as CpG adjuvant. The results demonstrate that both nasal vaccine candidates can boost the anti-RBD immune response and induce anti-N immunity, this systemic response shows cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and H-CoV antigens. In addition, a neutralizing response against SARS-CoV-2 that persisted for almost three months after the last dose was induced. A mucosal-specific and cross-reactive IgA response was also observed, mainly in monkeys vaccinated with PanCoV2. Furthermore, the specific IFN gamma-secreting response observed in the vaccinated groups peripheral blood mononuclear cells highlights the ability of these candidates to stimulate cellular immunity with a Th1 bias.

The chicken gut serves as a reservoir for these genes and provides favorable conditions for their horizontal transfer via mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids. Through this process, commensal bacteria can transfer ARGs to pathogens, facilitating their spread and increasing the risk of transmission to humans.\n\nIn this study, long-read sequencing was used to characterize plasmidome and resistome in 12 fecal samples from three houses of a commercial chicken broiler farm. All chickens received enrofloxacin in the first days of life, with one house additionally treated with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim combination. For comparison, metagenomic analysis using short-read sequencing was performed on the same samples.\n\nThis study revealed the presence of various ARGs associated with resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. Strong genetic association between MOBP-type plasmids and fluoroquinolone resistance was observed within chicken broiler farm. Temporal trends indicated progressive mobilization of these ARGs, suggesting an increasing potential for horizontal gene transfer. While fluoroquinolone resistance expanded over time, diaminopyrimidine resistance remained stable despite the antibiotic treatment. Most ARGs were carried on small plasmids, and complete plasmid reconstructions ranged from 2.6 to 47.6 kb.\n\nDespite technical limitations, our findings demonstrate that plasmidome sequencing can enrich metagenomic analysis by enabling the detection of low-abundance plasmid types and providing deeper insights into the dynamic plasmid-mediated dissemination of ARGs in the chicken gut microbiome.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Forty-nine Candida strains were co-cultured with the two E. coli strains. Both bacterial and yeast growth was monitored using flow cytometry and compared to monocultures. The effect of yeast culture supernatants on E. coli proliferation was also investigated. Metabolomic fingerprints and metabolite identification were performed using mass spectrometry-based approaches followed by multiblock statistical analyses. The inhibitory powers (IP) of yeasts against E. coli and vice versa varied significantly among fungal species. N. glabrata exhibited the strongest inhibition against E. coli-ATCC, while Candida lusitaniae, C. kefyr, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, and C. dubliniensis showed lower IPs. C. parapsilosis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae had no inhibitory effects. Against E. coli-OXA48, most yeasts displayed no inhibition, except for N. glabrata.

In this study, we apply state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based proteomics to perform dual perspective (i.e., host and pathogen) profiling of cryptococcal infection. Whole blood collected over a temporal scale following murine model challenged with the human fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, detected >3,000 host proteins and 160 fungal proteins. From the host perspective, temporal regulation of known immune-associated proteins, including eosinophil peroxidase and lipocalin-2, along with suppression of lipoproteins, demonstrated infection- and time-dependent host remodeling. Conversely, from the pathogen perspective, known and putative virulence-associated proteins were detected, including proteins associated with fungal extracellular vesicles and host immune modulation. We also observed and validated a new mechanism of immune system response to C. neoformans through modulation of haptoglobin. Further, we assessed the predictive power of dual perspective proteome profiling toward prognostics of cryptococcal infection and report a previously undisclosed integration among virulence factor production, immune system modulation, and individual model survival.

However, there is a growing list of species in which parts of the genome are removed from some cells of the organism through a process called programmed DNA elimination. In songbirds, an entire chromosome, called the germline-restricted chromosome (GRC), is lost from all somatic cells during early embryonic development. Nevertheless, the mechanisms, timing and consequences of this elimination remain largely unexplored. Here, we studied GRC elimination using two songbird species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and the Bengalese finch (Lonchura domestica), as model systems. We found that chromosome elimination occurs during the cleavage stage and is completed before egg laying and blastoderm formation. Elimination is associated with delayed attachment of the GRC to the mitotic spindle, changes in its histone modifications, and failure of chromatid separation in anaphase. The lagging GRC is then sequestered into a micronucleus with a defective envelope lacking the essential protein lamin B1, where the DNA is fragmented and degraded. Although the genetic basis of GRC elimination remains to be elucidated, our results suggest that changes of the GRC centromere together with epigenetic modifications of histones play a crucial role in GRC elimination from somatic cells. As the timing of elimination coincides with the germline/soma distinction, we propose that GRC elimination may play an important role in this crucial developmental process in songbirds.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

A stronger understanding of BRD4 biochemistry could provide a route to better outcomes. To advance on prior work, which has focused almost entirely on the binding of isolated bromodomains and acetylated peptides, we have sought the preferred nucleosomal binding partner of full-length BRD4. We demonstrate that BRD4 binds with sub-micromolar affinity to both unmodified nucleosomes and to DNA alone. In strong contrast to BRD4-peptide interactions, we also find that the affinity of BRD4 for nucleosomes is increased only 2-4-fold by histone acetylation and that this affinity has little dependence on the acetylation pattern. Despite this modest effect of acetylation, binding of BRD4 to acetyllysine in the nucleosome was more resistant to perturbation by mutation or small-molecule inhibition than BRD4-peptide interactions.

Nevertheless, traditional DNA probes utilized for cleavage by Cas12a have notable limitations as the cleaved probe only has one label. To overcome this challenge, we engineered a novel type of DNA probe with multiple fluorescein (FAM) labels and a biotin-labeled single-stranded DNA fragment (polyFAM probe). The cleaved polyFAM parts of probes were detected using a specially designed sandwich LFT, where FAM-specific antibodies were immobilized in the test zone and conjugated with gold nanoparticles. The LFT ensured accurate recognition of the cleaved polyFAM fragments within 10 minutes. A comparison of five distinct polyFAM probes revealed that the highest signal-to-noise ratio was achieved with a tripod-branched probe synthesized via trebler phosphoramidite modification. Each arm of the tripod probe consists of a hexaethylene glycol spacer ending in a FAM label. Upon Cas12a cleavage, the tripod structure carrying three FAMs is released and detected by LFT. A rapid magnetic separation strategy was subsequently implemented, facilitating the efficient removal of uncleaved probes via biotin-streptavidin capture within 5 minutes. The CRISPR/Cas12a-tripod-LFT strategy demonstrated excellent sensitivity without preamplification, with a detection limit of 1.4 pM for DNA target of Salmonella Typhimurium. The CRISPR/Cas12a-tripod-LFT with preliminary loop-mediated isothermal amplification enabled the detection of as few as 0.3 cells per reaction.

We recently showed that the major nosocomial pathogen Clostridioides difficile assembles a divisome that is fundamentally distinct from previously studied bacteria because it lacks functional orthologs of the septal peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes, FtsW and FtsI. While these enzymes were previously thought to mediate cell division in all walled bacteria, C. difficile instead uses the bifunctional Class A Penicillin Binding Protein PBP1 to mediate cell division. Here, we optimized a CRISPRi-based conditional expression system to define features within PBP1 that are critical for its essential functions. Our analyses identify a novel accessory domain that is required for PBP1 function and is conserved across Peptostreptococcaceae family PBP1 homologs. We further show that PBP1s glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase activities are both strictly required for bacterial growth. While PBP1 glycosyltransferase activity is required for septum synthesis during cell division, PBP1s transpeptidase activity is surprisingly dispensable for cell division, although TPase-deficient (PBP1TPase*) cells produce multiple aberrant septa. We demonstrate that the uncontrolled septum synthesis observed in PBP1TPase* cells depends on the non-essential Class B PBP, PBP3, but PBP3s catalytic activity is dispensable for this function. Since we also show that PBP3 is recruited to the divisome complex and forms a complex with PBP1, our analyses reveal a cryptic but important regulatory function for PBP3 in promoting C. difficile cell division.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

For example, the ability of a small molecule to accumulate within a bacterium influences its ability to serve as a chemical probe of an intracellular protein target and/or its efficacy as an antibacterial drug discovery entity. A general method to quantitatively interrogate both intrabacterial drug accumulation and metabolism (IBDM) is presented for Gram-negative bacteria and exemplified with Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in both single-compound and high-throughput formats. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based platform does not depend on drug labelling and its utility is highlighted through the demonstrated correlation of drug accumulation with drug minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in both wild type and efflux deficient strains of E. coli and a matched pair of K. pneumoniae clinical and laboratory strains of varying degrees of drug resistance. Furthermore, an investigation of drug synergy implicates the selective enhancement of the accumulation of one drug by its partner therapy. Finally, a high-throughput format is validated and deployed which provides a readily adaptable approach to screening assays.

Our findings confirm both the potential of C35 as a first-in-class protein-protein interaction inhibitor with antimicrobial activity, and the effectiveness of targeting hemophores as a strategy to inhibit S. aureus growth. To gain information for drug discovery purposes, the X-ray structure of Hb in the presence of the compound was solved. Unexpectedly, we discovered that, rather than the predicted binding pose, the molecule binds to tetrameric Hb in a cleft between the alpha subunits, stabilizing an R2 relaxed Hb conformation. This triggered further investigation of the effect of C35 on Hb functional properties, which showed a pronounced left-shift activity on oxygen binding curve (i.e., it strongly increases the Hb oxygen affinity).

Yet, how individuality arises and functions within a system designed to unify behavior remains poorly understood. Here, we use imaging-transcriptomics to comprehensively profile the QS transcriptional response of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa at single-cell resolution. We observe heterogeneity across all stages of QS, from signal production to public goods expression. While most cells cooperate, the extent of public goods contribution varies substantially, primarily due to transcriptional noise. Additionally, cells expressing high levels of a given exoproduct were often enriched for multiple other public goods. Expression of QS signal synthases, particularly in the Las and PQS systems, exhibits extreme cell-cell variability indicative of regulation, and exceeding levels observed in known differentiation into hypervirulent or motile subpopulations. These patterns are dynamic, peaking during early signaling, suggesting that a subset of highly committed cells may influence key decision points in the QS response. We find that cellular memory carried from prior growth cycles shapes QS dynamics via signaling-primed cells but does not influence de novo formation of hyper-signaling cells. Differentiation into hyper-signaling subpopulations is also robust to exogenous autoinducers across a wide concentration range, suggesting it is likely mediated by an internal mechanism. Despite variation in QS network outputs between strains, hyper-signaling subpopulations consistently emerge across diverse isolates, pointing to an evolutionarily conserved strategy. Our findings recast QS as a system that embeds a deliberately heterogeneous entry point within an otherwise synchronizing program, offering new insight into how bacterial populations balance cooperation and conflict.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear why these taxa are so dominant across a wide range of soil types and environmental conditions. Here we use genome-resolved metagenomics to test the hypothesis that strain-level differences exist in these taxa that are not adequately captured with standard marker gene sequencing, and that distinct strains harbor unique traits that reflect adaptations to different soil environments. We analyzed data from 331 natural soils spanning Australia to assess strain differentiation in Bradyrhizobium, a dominant soil bacterial genus of ecological importance. We developed a workflow for strain-level bacterial analyses of complex soil metagenomes, combining genomes from pre-existing databases with new genomes generated via targeted assembly from metagenomes to detect 181 Bradyrhizobium strains across the soil collection. In addition to a high degree of phylogenetic variation, we observed substantial variation in pangenome content and inferred traits, highlighting the breadth of diversity within this widespread genus. While members of the genus Bradyrhizobium were detected in > 80% of samples, most individual strains were restricted in their distributions. The overall strain-level community composition of Bradyrhizobium varied significantly across geographic space and environmental gradients, and was particularly associated with differences in temperature, soil pH, and soil nitrate and metal concentrations.

To explore phytoplankton biogeography and biogeochemical roles in field populations, we analyzed three years of 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing variant (ASV) data alongside biochemical measurements across the dynamic latitudinal gradient of the North Pacific Transition Zone. We (1) identified picophytoplankton community members associated with patterns in net community production (NCP), particulate organic carbon (POC), and particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and (2) uncovered co-occurring species that may influence their growth and abundance. Multivariate linear mixed modeling revealed that occurrence of chlorophytes explained 22.6% of NCP values, followed by stramenopiles and cyanobacteria. In contrast, POC and PON spatial patterns were best explained by chlorophyte and dinoflagellate spatial patterns. Weighted co-expression network analysis further showed NCP, POC, and PON correlations with a subset of ~40 ASVs belonging to chlorophytes, cyanobacteria, stramenopiles, haptophytes, and dinoflagellates that range in trophic strategy.

Iterons were previously found to interact with cognate Rep in a sequence-specific manner, and the iteron-Rep interaction was needed for viral DNA replication. Nonetheless, iterons of closely related viruses often have different sequences, suggesting diversifying selection. To identify selection pressures driving iteron diversification, we constructed tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV, isolate SH2) mutants in which the iteron motifs were replaced with those of closely related tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV, isolate Y35). All mutants replicated in inoculated leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana, but many failed to spread systemically. However, the systemic movement defects were mostly rescued by de novo mutations. Intriguingly, these de novo mutations did not restore the iterons to SH2 sequences. Rather, they likely enabled viral escape from repression exerted by the heterogenous Y35 iterons absent of a matching Rep. These results are consistent with iterons acting as sites of competitive binding by host-encoded transcription factors (TFs) and the cognate Rep. The iteron-TF binding commences as soon as viral genomes enter cell nuclei, committing genome copies to Rep mRNA transcription and protein translation; but also blocking them from replication. Conversely, iteron-Rep binding is possible only after Rep is produced, and likely repels TFs from some genome copies, permitting replication initiation. Testing this model through future research should clarify the intricate evolutionary interplays between geminiviruses and their crop hosts, and inform novel management strategies.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

The functions of budding yeast cohesin in chromosome segregation, replication and repair are regulated by its post-translational processing and modifications. Cohesin associates with centromeres, pericentric regions and discrete sites along chromosome arms till the end. Near chromosome ends, telomeres exist in a heterochromatin-like configuration and exert SIR-complex mediated telomere position effect resulting in repression of sub-telomeric gene transcription. Previously, we reported that cohesin has a SIR-independent role in subtelomeric gene silencing (Kothiwal and Laloraya, 2019). Here, we investigated the requirement of cohesin sumoylation in subtelomeric repression. We created a sumoylation-deficient cohesin complex by fusing the catalytic domain of a SUMO protease, ULP1, to the C-terminus of Mcd1/Scc1 (Mcd1-UD), a cohesin subunit. We show that cohesin sumoylation is required for repression of sub-telomeric genes. In agreement with our earlier observations of a SIR-independent role of cohesin in telomere silencing, SIR-proteins remained bound to a de-repressed subtelomeric gene in MCD1-UD and its expression further increased upon deletion of SIR2. Interestingly, we did not observe a cohesion defect in this mutant suggesting that sister chromatid cohesion and regulation of sub-telomere gene silencing are separable functions of cohesin. Telomere tethering to the nuclear envelope and telomere compaction are defective in MCD1-UD, indicating that sumoylation contributes to cohesins role in subtelomeric chromosome organization. Our data establish the relevance of cohesin sumoylation in subtelomeric repression, a function independent of its role in sister chromatid cohesion.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

We performed a meta-analysis of nine independent Hi-C and micro-C datasets upon acute CTCF- or cohesin protein-depletion and found that only at several hundred loci, newly gained enhancers-promoters (E-P) loops can be reproducibly observed upon CTCF depletion. The new E-P loops are cohesin-dependent and associated with recurrent gene activation. These findings allow us to map FINs and define their direct target genes genome-wide.

We used a high-throughput, image-based phenotyping pipeline to extract 13 measurements rapidly and with minimal impact on the fish. These phenotypic measurements, together with manually measured weight and fork length, were analysed for correlations and principal component structure. Additionally, heritabilities were estimated for each trait. Then, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed to identify growth-associated SNPs. To trial genomic prediction, we implemented machine learning (ML) models in XGBoost trained on SNP genotypes, with relatedness-based clustering used to minimise data leakage. Results: Via GWAS, we identifying 24 SNPs significantly associated with growth traits, with several mapping to genes involved in metabolic and developmental pathways. Despite the high-dimensionality of these data, the ML approach still achieved moderate levels of predictability. The top ML growth SNPs showed some congruency with the GWAS growth SNPs, and 75 % of the GWAS SNPs were used by the ML model to predict weight.

Expanding these signatures to cancer classification trees reveals common patterns not only among physiologically related cancer types but also among clinico-pathologically distant types, such as different cancers originating from neural crest derived cells.

One such niche inhabited by Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is the host cell cytosol, a compartment characterized by significant barriers to entry, metabolic limitation, and immune surveillance. Previously, we identified L. monocytogenes transposon mutants defective for intracellular survival due to disruptions in key metabolic pathways, including cell wall biosynthesis, menaquinone production, and pyruvate metabolism. One of these mutants mapped to a central component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, pdhC::Tn. Notably, this mutant exhibits pronounced survival defects during infection, despite retaining robust growth and survival in nutrient-rich media. We go on to show that disruption of pdhA::Tn and pdhD::Tn similarly led to virulence attenuation during intra-macrophage growth, plaquing assays, and murine infections. Respiro-fermentative metabolic profiling revealed that pdhC::Tn mutants have an altered respiro-fermentative metabolism with more prominent secretion of lactate. Further, unbiased metabolomic profiling revealed a global starvation phenotype with lower levels of upper glycolytic intermediates and TCA cycle intermediates coupled with elevated intra-bacterial levels of pyruvate and lactate. We then demonstrate that PDH mutants are unable to efficiently utilize phosphotransferase (PTS)-dependent carbon sources and that their growth can be rescued using non-PTS-mediated carbon sources such as hexose phosphates. To identify genetic suppressors of PDH deficiency, we performed an EMS mutagenesis screen using fructose - a PTS-transported carbon source - as the sole carbon source. Five suppressors each contained a single independent mutation in the redox sensing regulator rex. Subsequently, we show that loss of rex restores pdhC::Tn mutant ability to consume PTS-mediated carbon sources through the alleviation of fermentative repression. Further, pdhC::Tn suppressor mutants show restored intracellular growth, but not virulence in vivo. Together, these findings indicate that a key defect in PDH mutants is the inability to import and metabolize PTS-dependent carbon sources in the host cytosol. We posit this impairment leads to disruptions in redox balance and a shift in respiro-fermentative metabolism, ultimately contributing to the loss of intracellular fitness and virulence.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Using this method, we discovered that intracellular Shigella and Salmonella become targeted by UFM1-protein ligase 1 (UFL1), an E3 ligase that catalyses the covalent attachment of Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1) to target substrates in a process called UFMylation. We show that Shigella antagonises UFMylation in a dual manner: first, using its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to shield from UFL1 recruitment; second, preventing UFM1 decoration by the bacterial effector IpaH9.8. Absence of UFMylation leads to an increase of bacterial burden in both human cells and zebrafish larvae, suggesting that UFMylation is a highly conserved antibacterial pathway. Contrary to canonical ubiquitylation, the protective role of UFMylation is independent of autophagy. Altogether, our proximity mapping of the host-bacterial interface identifies UFMylation as an ancient antibacterial pathway and holds great promise to reveal other cell-autonomous immunity mechanisms.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

This study examined whether CD-related dysbiosis is reflected in the fermentation behavior of stool-derived microbial communities cultured in vitro on simple carbon substrates (glucose or acetate+lactate). Shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics revealed that CD-derived communities produced lower levels of butyrate (mainly via lactate and acetate), valerate, caproate, and propionate, and higher levels of ethanol and certain amino acids compared to healthy controls. These metabolic alterations aligned with compositional shifts, including a loss of beneficial commensals (e.g., Coprococcus catus, Ruminococcus torques, Eubacterium rectale, Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) and an overrepresentation of CD-associated taxa, particularly Escherichia coli. Metabolic potential analysis revealed an enrichment of genes linked to ethanol and amino acid synthesis in CD-associated microbiotas, underscoring the metabolic adaptability of E. coli. Notably, acetate+lactate substrates supported the growth of healthy microbiota-associated bacteria, whereas glucose favored CD-associated taxa, highlighting disease-specific metabolic imbalances. These findings suggest that in vitro fermentation profiling may help distinguish CD-associated dysbiosis from a healthy microbiome and might support the development of microbiome-informed diagnostic or therapeutic approaches for CD.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Currently, Flow Cytometry and Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC) offer numerous advantages, but are marred by barriers to accessibility: (1) high instrument costs; (2) labor-intensive, technically demanding sample preparation; and (3) reliance on consumable reagents (i.e., fluorescent labels). To achieve phenotype characterization without these constraints, we evaluated the low-cost, low-input ARTiMiS IFC as a potential alternative instrument technology. To demonstrate this approach, we used intracellular lipid content in microalgae, an important phenotype for production of biofuels and high-value bioproducts, as the phenotype of interest. Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) unsupervised deep learning methodology was implemented to encode phenotype variation from un-annotated training data. The VAE embeddings were compared with other label-free predictor modalities to evaluate the stability of VAE data encoding across replicates and its predictive power to estimate the target phenotype. The VAE embeddings were robust and consistent between culture batches, and yielded accurate, consistent predictions of the demonstration phenotype in a high-throughput, non-destructive, dye-free methodology. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that VAE-enabled ARTiMiS IFC may serve as a viable alternative for cell phenotype characterization while overcoming several of the key drawbacks of traditional high-fidelity techniques.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

However, whether and how lipofuscin contributes to the development of liver fibrosis remains unknown. Using a mouse model of liver fibrosis induced by choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet (HFD), we found that lipofuscin accumulation preceded the emergence of liver fibrosis. A significant, positive and strong correlation was observed between the hepatic lipofuscin levels and liver fibrosis severity. Neutrophils were recruited to the liver in mice fed HFD, and those that were in close proximity to lipofuscin-laden hepatocytes displayed higher susceptibility to produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We revealed that lipofuscin-laden hepatocytes generated CXCL5, which promoted NETosis. When mice defective in NETosis (Vav1-Cre Padi4fl/fl) were fed HFD, they had significantly less collagen deposition in the liver, indicating the critical role of NETs in the development of liver fibrosis associated with lipofuscin accumulation. Notably, we showed that tirzepatide, the latest glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor dual agonist recently approved for type 2 diabetes, attenuated NETosis-dependent liver fibrosis by preventing hepatic lipofuscin accumulation, and reduced other hepatic senescence signatures as well. In summary, our study unveiled the pathogenic, NETosis-enhancing effect of lipofuscin in liver fibrosis, and demonstrated the potential of repurposing tirzepatide for combating liver fibrosis associated with lipofuscin and for preventing organ senescence.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

However, our biochemical understanding of these cytoskeletal systems has been hindered by the need for assays that can controllably generate spatiotemporal calcium dynamics to probe their behavior. Here, we define the quantitative requirements for calcium-dependent self-assembly of the Tetrahymena cortical cytoskeletal protein Tcb2 using a microscopy-based spatiotemporally controlled optical calcium release assay. Light-driven uncaging of the photolabile calcium chelator DMNP-EDTA stimulates rapid localized self-assembly of Tcb2 into micron-scale protein networks. We quantify how the growth, size, and lifetime of Tcb2 networks is controlled by the duration and intensity of the applied light pulse. Incorporating the fluorescent calcium indicator Rhod-5N allows inference of the spatiotemporal distribution of calcium-bound Tcb2 monomers during the reaction and identifies a sharp, ultrasensitive transition to Tcb2 self-assembly. By applying this assay to mutants in Tcb2's four EF hand domains, we show that D184 is the key calcium binding site that licenses Tcb2 for self-assembly and define quantitative roles for other binding sites in tuning Tcb2's calcium-responsiveness. Our approach reveals a rich space of structures and regulation available to a single-protein system through coupling calcium-binding to ultrasensitive self-assembly, opening new paths forward to understanding other protist filament networks and contractile myonemes.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

We identify a set of brain regions along the dorsal pathway - from early visual cortex to the intraparietal and frontal regions - that encode specific non-symbolic numerical information across formats and modalities. The numerical distance effect, a hallmark of magnitude encoding, was observed in most of these regions. We found aligned representation of numerical information across visual and auditory modalities in intraparietal and frontal regions, but only when they shared a sequential presentation format.

We show that blocking ATO function in C. albicans impairs SCFA uptake and growth, particularly on acetate. The uptake of acetate is largely dependent on a functional Ato1 (also known as Frp3/Ato3) and it is effectively abolished upon deletion of all ATO genes. We further demonstrate that deletion of the entire ATO gene family, but not inactivation of ATO1 alone, compromises the stable colonisation of C. albicans in the murine gastrointestinal tract following bacterial disruption by broad-spectrum antibiotics. Our data suggest that the ATO gene family has expanded and diversified during the evolution of C. albicans to promote the fitness of this fungal commensal during gut colonisation, in part through SCFA utilisation.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

Taking advantage of a mutation in the highly conserved actin binding interface of another MF myosin, the jordan (jd) mutation of Myo15A that reduces its function, the impact of altering the myosin-F-actin interaction on filopodia formation was investigated. The jd mutation, a D to G substitution (Gong et al, 2022, Sci Adv), was introduced into DdMyo7 or Myo10 and filopodia formation assessed by quantitative analysis of number, length and myosin tip enrichment. The mutation significantly decreased filopodia initiation and tip intensity of both DdMyo7 and Myo10. This is consistent with impairment of myosin-based reorganization of cortical actin at the cortex, with myosins in the initiation complex remaining at the tip as the filopodium extends. The DdMyo7 jd mutation did not affect filopodia length. In the case of Myo10, while the jd mutation reduced Myo10 velocity of intrafilopodial motility by 40%, resulting in reduced levels of myosin at the filopodia tip, the jd mutant did not consistently affect the length of filopodia in different cell lines. This indicates that the major role of Myo10 may not be to promote filopodia elongation by reducing membrane tension, as has been proposed. Rather, the phenotype of the DdMyo7 and Myo10 jd mutants indicates that the major role of evolutionarily diverse filopodial myosins is to re-organize actin filaments at the membrane-cortex interface during the critical initiation step.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

In prior work, this framework demonstrated that RNA synthesis occurred within the ideal zone (intermediate density) portions of the domain. Naturally, this creates a question of where genes are positioned in relation to the packing domain architecture and which genetic material fills the domain core to sustain transcription. Here we propose that this could be solved by the encoded positioning of introns, intergenic segments, and exons as a projection of the functional packing layers of domains. This suggests that introns and intergenic segments are coupled to adjacent exons to generate coherent packing domain volumes. We illustrate how this organization would reconcile contradictions in epigenetic patterns, non-randomness in oncogenic mutations, and produce durable transcriptional memory.

This state-dependent activity was subject to stress-induced cholinergic modulation through muscarinic 1 receptor (M1R) signaling, leading to selective impairments in temporal but not contextual associative memory. Slice studies showed that these effects were likely due to M1R-mediated inhibition of vRSPL1 neurons, transiently disrupting their local connectivity as well as responsiveness to afferent input. Together, we demonstrate a mechanism by which vRSPL1 activity aligned to immobility coordinate the formation of temporal associations. Through its sensitivity to stress-related cholinergic modulation, this mechanism presents vulnerability to traumatic amnesia, especially for temporal details of episodic memories.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

While local activation in the periphery enhances immune protection, dysregulation can trigger a self-amplifying cascade that spreads beyond the initial site, resulting in tissue injury. In the brain, complement proteins regulate synaptic plasticity and connectivity, raising the possibility that similar mechanisms of maladaptive propagation may disrupt neural circuits under pathological conditions. Although complement dysregulation is linked to neurological and psychiatric disorders, the impact of localized upregulation in a small subset of cells on broader cortical networks remains unclear. To examine this, we overexpressed the schizophrenia (SCZ) risk gene C4 (C4-OE) in approximately 2% of prefrontal cortex neurons in mice using in utero electroporation. Bulk RNA sequencing of microdissected tissue revealed widespread transcriptional changes in a network predominantly comprising untransfected cells. C4-OE induced the upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, cytoprotection, and neurogenesis, suggesting a response consistent with compensatory remodeling or aberrant plasticity. Co-expression analysis identified a C4b-containing module enriched for dendritic development and cell cycle regulation, indicating alterations in circuit maturation. In contrast, immune and inflammatory genes were broadly downregulated, suggesting homeostatic suppression in response to sustained complement activity. Comparisons with human SCZ proteomic datasets revealed conserved gene signatures, highlighting the potential of our model to capture disease-relevant mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that sparse C4 overexpression can trigger widespread transcriptional changes across neural circuits, suggesting that local complement dysregulation may spread through cortical networks and drive broader functional disruption.", "date": "2025-05-29", "journal": ""}

This problem is exemplified by insect flight, where sub-millisecond modifications in wing-steering muscle activity are necessary for stability and maneuverability. Although the muscles that control wing motion are anatomically and functionally stratified into distinct motor modules3-7, comparatively little is known about the architecture of the sensory circuits that regulate their precise firing times. Here, we leverage an existing volume of an adult female VNC of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster8,9 to reconstruct the complete population of afferents in the haltere--nature's only biological ''gyroscope''10,11--and their synaptic partners. We morphometrically classify these neurons into distinct subtypes and design split-GAL4 lines that help us determine the peripheral locations from which each subtype originates. We find that each subtype, rather than originating from the same anatomical location, is comprised of multiple regions on the haltere. We then trace the flow of rapid mechanosensory feedback from the peripheral haltere receptors to the central motor circuits that control wing kinematics.

Here, we performed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the structural mechanisms through which ammonia binding triggers SCAP/Insig dissociation and subsequently activate SREBP. The SCAP S4 helix exists in two distinct conformations: a partially unfolded S4 and an intact S4; the transition between these states may constitute a crucial aspect of SCAP activation. We first studied the binding of ammonia to SCAP in different S4 conformational states. We then explored how the binding of ammonia or 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) affects the conformational transition of S4 using targeted MD simulations. Finally, we performed comparative analysis of the 25-HC-bound inactive SCAP and the ammonia-bound active SCAP. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of S4 helix conformation in activating the SCAP protein. Our simulations suggest that ammonia and 25-HC act as an agonist and antagonist of SCAP activation, respectively. Specifically, ammonia binding facilitates the transition of S4 from the unfolded to the straight conformation, triggering subsequent conformational changes in the transmembrane domain of SCAP.

Here, we take advantage of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads to characterize an exhaustive catalogue of 612 candidate inversions between 197 bp and 4.4 Mb of length and flanked by <190-kb long inverted repeats (IRs). For that, we developed a bioinformatic package to identify inversion alleles reliably from long read data. Next, using a combination of different DNA extraction, library preparation, and ONT sequencing protocols, we showed that ultra-long reads (50-100 kb) and adaptive sampling are an efficient method to detect most human inversions. Lastly, by analyzing ONT data from 54 diverse individuals, 87-99% of the inversions could be genotyped in each sample, depending mainly on read and IR length and genome coverage. Both orientations were observed for 155 of the analyzed regions (frequency 0.01-0.49), which multiplies by three the polymorphic IR-mediated inversions studied in detail so far.
