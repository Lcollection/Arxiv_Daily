To understand how brain signals generate behavior, it is critical to understand how these descending pathways are organized onto the body MNs. In the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, MNs controlling muscles in the leg, wing, and other motor systems reside in a ventral nerve cord (VNC), analogous to the mammalian spinal cord. In companion papers, we introduced a densely-reconstructed connectome of the Drosophila Male Adult Nerve Cord (MANC, Takemura et al., 2023), including cell type and developmental lineage annotation (Marin et al., 2023), which provides complete VNC connectivity at synaptic resolution. Here, we present a first look at the organization of the VNC networks connecting DNs to MNs based on this new connectome information. We proofread and curated all DNs and MNs to ensure accuracy and reliability, then systematically matched DN axon terminals and MN dendrites with light microscopy data to link their VNC morphology with their brain inputs or muscle targets. We report both broad organizational patterns of the entire network and fine-scale analysis of selected circuits of interest. We discover that direct DN-MN connections are infrequent and identify communities of intrinsic neurons linked to control of different motor systems, including putative ventral circuits for walking, dorsal circuits for flight steering and power generation, and intermediate circuits in the lower tectulum for coordinated action of wings and legs. Our analysis generates hypotheses for future functional experiments and, together with the MANC connectome, empowers others to investigate these and other circuits of the Drosophila ventral nerve cord in richer mechanistic detail.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Compared to its ancestor, the variant exhibited shorter generation times, reduced sporulation, auto-aggregation, and lower biomass in mixed-species biofilms.

As global change accelerates, phenotypic plasticity in functional traits may provide a modality for fine-tuning responses to atypical or stressful environments. While various studies have explored induced plant trichomes as a response to biotic stress, emerging evidence suggests that trichome induction may also function as a broader tactic for managing a range of environmental stressors, including abiotic chemical stress. Using the annual invasive weed velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), we examine whether herbicide exposure induces changes in trichome traits and whether these responses are associated with herbicide resistance and fitness outcomes. We quantified changes in trichome density and trichome type proportions across control and glyphosate (active ingredient in 'Roundup') treated plants. We identified positive correlations between induced total trichome density and herbicide resistance, as well as induced branched trichomes and herbicide resistance. Selection analysis further revealed positive linear selection acting upon induced trichome density in the presence of herbicide, as well as correlative selection favoring induced trichome density and intermediate plant growth. Overall, our study indicates that plastic defenses like trichomes may contribute to plant performance under novel abiotic stress and highlights key constraints shaping the evolution of stress-responsiveness.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that the Iroquois-complex transcription factor Araucan plays a specific and essential role in modulating wing scale iridescence in the common buckeye butterfly, Junonia coenia. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, we demonstrate that loss of araucan function causes dorsal wing scales to shift from golden-brown to blue iridescence, and eyespot center scales to shift from saturated purple-violet to dull grey-brown. These phenotypes are associated with thickness of the lower lamina in scale cells, a structural feature known to influence thin-film interference, along with reduction of pigmentation in ground scales. We further show that the patterning transcription factors Optix and Spalt bind to the araucan promoter during wing development, suggesting they may regulate araucan expression in a color pattern-specific manner. Together, our findings identify araucan as a critical effector of scale ultrastructure, structural coloration, and pigmentation in butterflies and provide new insights into how core wing patterning genes may control the evolution of iridescence.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

P.; Carbonero, H.; Vargas, R.; Chaves, C.", "abstract": "The main conservation risks for wild non-human primates (NHP) in Costa Rica, Mesoamerica, is deforestation and the allocation of lands for agriculture. This is because they result in a mosaic of forest patches that differ in size and ecological properties. NHP, being the vertebrates with the highest risk and rate of extinction, slowly adapt to this rapid environmental change, optimizing their metabolic costs to survive and reproduce. One way to balance these costs is to use forest patches depending on the benefits they provide, such as food, shelter, or social contact. To understand the possible environmental factors that predict the usage of a series of 8 connected forest patches by Ateles geoffroyi, Alouata paliatta, and Sapajus imitator we collected demographic, behavioral, climatological and other environmental data from 2018 until 2021. We used information-theoretic metrics to identify the factors that best explained the presence and behavior of the species of interest in the forest patches studied, and fit the data to a set of models built informed a priori. Using the best explanatory factors, we k-fold cross-validated 9 classifier algorithms to identify the best predictive models for the presence of the monkeys studied and their behavioral patterns given the data. Presence was highest in warmer, more humid days, especially when other groups were present in the same patch. Behavioral patterns were different in each patch; monkeys rested more often when other groups of the same species were present, and foraged more during warmer, more humid days, and smaller groups. Predictive models for the presence of the species studied, trained with the 3 best explanatory factors, reached an accuracy between 70-96%, with Gradient Boost Classifier performing the best. In contrast, behavioral patterns were more unpredictable, with the the algorithms tested only reaching between 43-51% accuracy, the AdaBoost Classifier being the best. Our findings suggest that the usage of the 8 forest patches monitored by the monkeys studied depends on patch characteristics, not related to size nor the presence of a reserve, by the presence of other NHP in the patch and the meteorological conditions. Further work on the ecological characteristics of these patches can clarify the mechanisms modulating behavioral patterns.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Our results confirm that cancer cell lines indeed accumulate more mutations compared to native cancers but retain similar CNV profiles. We demonstrate that many relevant oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are altered by CNV events in both cancers and their corresponding cell lines.

It is a serious public health and veterinary concern, with significant consequences for both human and livestock populations. An abattoir-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to September 2023 at Gondar ELFORA Abattoir, Northwest Ethiopia, to assess hematobiochemical alterations and pathological lesions induced by fasciolosis in slaughtered cattle. The study included one hundred apparently healthy male local-breed cattle, divided into two groups of fifty: one infected and one non-infected. Cattle were selected using a purposive sampling technique. Infected cattle showed significantly lower mean values for hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), lymphocytes, monocytes, total protein, albumin, and glucose compared to non-infected cattle. Conversely, they had higher mean values for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, eosinophils, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Basophil levels were similar in both groups. Liver alterations observed in acute fasciolosis included hepatomegaly with rounded edges and the presence of juvenile flukes within the parenchyma, while in chronic fasciolosis, the liver appeared smaller, firm, with a corrugated capsule and dilated bile ducts containing twisted flukes. Microscopically, acute fasciolosis showed eosinophil infiltration, hemosiderin pigmentation, and congestion around the central vein and sinusoids, whereas chronic fasciolosis showed fibrosis, bile duct proliferation, and metaplasia of epithelial cells from columnar to cuboidal. The observed hematobiochemical alterations correlated with both the gross and microscopic findings, indicating a significant impact on liver physiology and histology. Therefore, regular screening and proper deworming are essential to reduce bovine fasciolosis, especially in high-risk abattoirs. Hematology and biochemical tests should be part of routine diagnosis for early detection and liver function assessment, while histopathology confirms infection stage. Awareness and training for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers are vital to improve disease control. Further research on seasonal trends, risk factors, and drug resistance is needed to develop better control strategies.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Behavioral plasticity in animals influences direct species interactions, but its effects can also spread unpredictably through ecological networks, creating indirect interactions that are difficult to anticipate. We use coarse-grained models to investigate how changes in species behavior shape these indirect interactions and influence the broader dynamics of ecological networks. As an illustrative example, we examine predators that feed on two types of prey, each of which temporarily reduces activity after evading an attack, thereby lowering vulnerability at the expense of growth. We demonstrate that this routine behavior can shift the indirect interaction between prey species from apparent competition to mutualism or parasitism. These shifts occur when predator capture efficiency drops below a critical threshold, causing frequent hunting failures. As a result, one prey species indirectly promotes the growth of the other by relaxing its density dependence through a cascade of network effects, paradoxically increasing predator biomass despite decreased hunting success. Empirical capture probabilities often fall within the range where such dynamics are predicted. We characterize these shifts in the qualitative nature of species interactions as changes in interaction valence, highlighting how routine animal behaviors reshape community structure through cascading changes within ecological networks.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Across two large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that scale-free networks, due to their pronounced node-degree inhomogeneity, are more compressible and learnable than other network types, and confirm the efficacy of the compressive learning approach. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings reveal that compressive pre-learning enhances structured neural representations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

J.", "abstract": "Humans use multiple sensory systems to estimate body orientation in space. Sensory contributions change depending on context. A predominant concept for the underlying multisensory integration (MSI) is the linear summation of weighted inputs from individual sensory systems. Changes of sensory contributions are typically attributed to some mechanism explicitly adjusting weighting factors. We provide evidence for a conceptually different mechanism that performs a multisensory correction if the reference of a sensory input moves in space without the need to explicitly change sensory weights. The correction is based on a reconstruction of the sensory reference frame motion (RFM) and automatically corrects erroneous inputs, e.g., when looking at a moving train. The proposed RFM estimator contains a nonlinear dead-zone that blocks corrections at slow velocities. We first demonstrate that this mechanism accounts for the apparent changes in sensory contributions. Secondly, using a balance control model, we show predictions of specific distortions in body sway responses to perturbations caused by this nonlinearity. Experiments measuring sway responses of 24 subjects (13 female, 11 male) to visual scene movements confirmed these predictions. The findings indicate that the central nervous system resolves sensory conflicts by an internal reconstruction of the cause of the conflict. Thus, the mechanism links the concept of causal inference to shifts in sensory contributions, providing a cohesive picture of MSI for the estimation of body orientation in space.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

L.; Jackson, M. R.; McCullough, D.; SCOTT, H.; Barnett, C. P.; Webb, S. T.; Smith, M. D.; Jankovic-Karasoulos, T.; Dekker, G. A.; Roberts, C. T.", "abstract": "Background: Unexplained stillbirth may occur due to premature placental ageing, with unexpected deterioration of placental function for gestational age. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enzyme-resistant RNA molecules that accumulate in ageing tissues. Furthermore, circRNAs bind gDNA directly, forming circRNA:DNA complexes which can induce DNA breaks and genomic instability. Objectives: This study investigated tissue ageing and circRNA accumulation with gestational age in healthy and stillbirth placentae, and determined whether circRNAs directly interact with placental DNA causing DNA damage and cellular senescence. Study design: Placenta samples (n=60 term uncomplicated; n=4 unexplained stillbirth, 23, 26, 31, 34 weeks gestation) were assessed. Abundance of 7 candidate circRNAs (circ_0009000, circ_0024157, circ_0061017, circ_0036877, circ_0054624, circ_0111277 and circ_0000284), and their linear transcripts, was quantified using qPCR. Total RNA, in the presence and absence of RNase R and RNase H1, was determined using the Qubit fluorimeter. Physical interaction of candidate circRNAs with DNA was confirmed by DNA:RNA ImmunoPrecipitation (DRIP)- qPCR. Telomere length was assessed using real-time PCR. Relative abundance of senescence- associated genes was quantified using qPCR. DNA damage was assessed using an alkaline Comet Assay. Patient-derived trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) differentiation into syncytiotrophoblasts or extravillous trophoblasts was confirmed using immunofluorescence microscopy. The effect of circ_0000284 knockdown was assessed following transfection with either a siRNA (designed to knockdown circ_0000284) or a scrambled siRNA control, at 5, 10 and 20 nM final concentrations using Lipofectamine RNAiMax. Abundance of circRNAs in maternal blood sampled between 15-16 weeks gestation (n=12 control, n=6 women who went on to have a stillbirth) was determined using qPCR. Appropriate statistical analyses were undertaken (SPSS). Results: Placental DNA damage, senescence and expression of 7 candidate circRNAs, but not their linear transcripts, were increased in 40 and 41+ weeks gestation samples, and in stillbirth, compared with earlier gestations (37-39 weeks). DRIP-qPCR signal size was significantly larger in term placentae than in enzyme-treated controls, confirming that all candidate circRNA loci bind to placental DNA. Abundance of circRNA was significantly decreased with the addition of RNase H1, compared with all healthy gestation samples, indicating that stillbirth placentae may lack RNase H1. Telomere length is shorter in placentae from stillbirths compared with healthy 37 weeks placentae. Depletion of circ_0000284 by specific siRNA in primary cells significantly reduced DNA damage and increased expression of senescence-associated genes compared to control. Abundance of candidate circRNAs are increased in maternal blood at 16 weeks gestation for women who went on to have a stillbirth compared with women who had live births. Conclusions: Stillbirth placentae show accelerated ageing with shortened telomeres, premature DNA breaks, increased cellular senescence and accumulation of candidate circRNAs, at levels consistent with older gestation tissue. These circRNAs bind to DNA in the placenta, and circ_0000284 knockdown reduces DNA breaks and senescence in primary placental cells. Therefore, circRNAs play a role in placental ageing and associate with stillbirth, likely via decreased RNase H1 abundance, preventing circRNA degradation and facilitating circRNA accumulation, and subsequent circR-loop formation. circRNAs present a viable method of stillbirth risk screening.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

The levels of total 5mC vary enormously between different species, and the DNA methyltransferases that introduce 5mC have been repeatedly lost in several independent lineages. DNA methyltransferases are a threat to genomic stability due to the increased mutagenicity of 5mC bases and the propensity of DNA methyltransferases themselves to introduce DNA alkylation damage as an off-target effect. However, whether alkylation damage explains why 5mC is frequently lost in evolution is unclear. Here we tested the fitness consequences of DNA methyltransferase-induced alkylation damage by introducing a eukaryotic-like 5mC system into E. coli. We showed that introducing 5mC genome-wide leads to increased sensitivity to alkylating agents, which is strongly enhanced by removal of the 3mC repair enzyme AlkB. Unexpectedly, we discovered that 5mC introduction led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. We showed that this is due to increased formation of reactive oxygen in the presence of 5mC. We determined that reactive oxygen species led to non-enzymatic oxidation of 5mC, producing modified cytosines such as 5fC that are recognised as DNA base damage in E. coli. Overall, our work identifies increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, as well as alkylating agents, as a negative consequence of genome-wide 5mC. Oxidative stress is frequently encountered by organisms in their environment, thus offering a plausible reason for total loss of 5mC in some species.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Spatial transcriptomic analysis further revealed the localization of these cell types and identified a third stromal population, osteogenic-lineage cells, exclusively present in the bone biopsy. Functional ex vivo assays using sorted stromal populations derived from B-ALL patient bone marrow aspirates demonstrated that both early mesenchymal and adipogenic progenitors secrete key niche-supportive factors, including CXCL12 and Osteopontin, and support leukemic cell survival and chemoresistance. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that B-ALL cells interact differently with stromal subtypes. Notably, adipogenic progenitors, but not early mesenchymal progenitors, provide support to leukemic cells through interleukin-7 and VCAM1 signaling. Stromal cells from B-ALL patients exhibited an enhanced adipogenic differentiation capacity compared to healthy controls. Moreover, co-culture experiments showed that B-ALL cells induce adipogenic differentiation in healthy MSCs through a cell contact-dependent mechanism. Adipogenic progenitors were also enriched in relapse samples, implicating them in disease progression. These findings highlight the complexity of the B-ALL microenvironment and identify different specialized stromal niches with which the leukemic cells can engage.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

We uncover a mechanism in which enzyme-induced changes in shear viscosity arise from dynamic interactions among the substrate, product, and the protein crowder.

Limitations in current experimental models have hindered our knowledge of the disease. We developed a 3D blood-brain barrier (BBB) model with enhanced barrier properties using primary brain endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Exposure to parasite egress products increased microvascular permeability, likely due to transcriptional downregulation of junctional and vascular development genes in endothelial cells. In addition, it increased the expression of ferroptosis markers, antigen presentation and type I interferon genes and upregulated the JAK-STAT pathway across all BBB cell types. Incubation with cytoadherent schizont-stage Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes induced a similar, but highly localized transcriptional shift, along with inter-endothelial gaps at sites of parasite egress, significantly increasing permeability. The co-administration of egress products with the JAK-STAT inhibitor Ruxolitinib prevented junctional disruption and BBB breakdown.

F.", "abstract": "How learning is affected by context is a fundamental question of neuroscience, as the ability to generalize learning to different contexts is necessary for navigating the world. An example of swift contextual generalization is observed in conditioning tasks, where performance is quickly generalized from one context to another. A key question in identifying the neural substrate underlying this ability is how the hippocampus (HPC) represents task-related stimuli across different environments, given that HPC cells exhibit place-specific activity that changes across contexts (remapping). In this study, we used calcium imaging to monitor hippocampal neuron activity as animals performed a conditioning task across multiple spatial contexts. We investigated whether hippocampal cells, which encode both spatial locations (place cells) and task-related information, could maintain their task representation even when their spatial encoding remapped in a new spatial context. To assess the consistency of task representations, we used advanced dimensionality reduction techniques combined with machine learning to develop manifold representations of population level HPC activity. The results showed that task-related neural representations remained stable even as place cell representations of spatial context changed, thus demonstrating similar embedding geometries of neural representations of the task across different spatial contexts. Notably, these patterns were not only consistent within the same animal across different contexts but also significantly similar across different animals, suggesting a standardized neural encoding or 'neural syntax' in the hippocampus. These findings bridge a critical gap between memory and navigation research, revealing how the hippocampus maintains cognitive consistency across different spatial environments. These findings also suggest that hippocampal function is governed by a neural framework shared between animals, an observation that may have broad implications for understanding memory, learning, and related cognitive processes. Looking ahead, this work opens new avenues for exploring the fundamental principles underlying hippocampal encoding strategies.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

In contrast, flowering asynchrony is promoted when there is inter-species competition for pollinators. In this multiyear study, we analyse the flowering phenology of a seasonal, herbaceous community (Kaas plateau) in Western Ghats, India to identify environmental constraints that may influence flowering synchrony. We addressed the questions: (a) Is flowering seasonality correlated with climatic factors? (b) Is there evidence for flowering synchrony within the community? (c) Do plant-pollinator interactions shift with flowering phenology? In Kaas, we recorded flowering phenology of 76 herbaceous species and found that climatic factors influenced their flowering phenology. We also identified the community to be composed of a few mass flowering (MF) species (~30%) and several non-mass flowering (nMF) species (~70%). Using two novel synchrony indices, temporal overlap (SItemp) and synchrony in abundance (SIabd), we also identified higher asynchronous flowering within the community than expected. Notably, species sharing the same floral colour, showed marked absence of synchrony, thus suggesting that competition and not pollinator-mediated facilitation drives flowering asynchrony within Kaas. Finally, pollination networks were observed to shift with flowering abundances within the community. Our findings reveal that even seasonal landscapes like the laterite plateaus, despite their short flowering season that last only 4-5 months, exhibit an overall asynchronous flowering phenology. And, the synchronous flowering for which the Kaas plateau is famous, was noted to be mostly due to a few mass flowering species that alter across years.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Each bat must avoid collisions with walls and conspecifics while locating the exit, all amidst overlapping acoustic signals. This crowded environment creates the risk of acoustic jamming, in which the calls of neighboring bats interfere with echo detection, potentially obscuring vital information. Despite these challenges, bats navigate these conditions with remarkable success. Although bats have access to multiple sensory cues, here we focused on whether echolocation alone could provide sufficient information for orientation under such high-interference conditions. To explore whether and how they manage this challenge, we developed a sensorimotor model that mimics the bats echolocation behavior under high-density conditions. Our model suggests that the problem of acoustic jamming may be less severe than previously assumed. Frequent calls with short inter-pulse intervals (IPI) increase the sensory input flow, allowing integration of echoic information across multiple calls. When combined with simple movement-guidance strategies, such as following walls and avoiding nearby obstacles, this accumulated information enables effective navigation in dense acoustic environments. Together, these findings demonstrate a plausible mechanism by which bats may overcome acoustic interference and underscore the role of signal redundancy in supporting robust echolocation-based navigation. Beyond advancing our understanding of bat behavior, they also offer valuable insights for swarm robotics and collective movement in complex environments.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

In guard cells, activation of GORK causes K+ efflux, reducing turgor pressure and closing stomata. However, how GORK is regulated remains largely elusive. Here, we solved the cryo-EM structure of Arabidopsis GORK, revealing an unusual symmetry reduction (from C4 to C2) feature within its tetrameric assembly. This symmetry reduction in GORK channel is driven by ANK dimerization, which disrupts the coupling between transmembrane helices and cytoplasmic domains, thus maintaining GORK in an autoinhibited state. Electrophysiological and structural analyses further confirmed that ANK dimerization inhibits GORK, and its removal restores C4 symmetry, converting GORK to an activatable state. This dynamic switching between C2 and C4 symmetry, mediated by ANK dimerization, presents a GORK target site that guard cells regulate to switch the plant K+ channel between inhibited and activatable states, thus controlling stomatal movement in response to environmental stimuli.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Fluoxetine elicited a robust transcriptomic response in the DG, where mature granule cells adopted a juvenile-like profile. This shift was characterized by upregulation of the transcription factor SOX11 and the neurotrophic factor BDNF, as well as decreased ECM and enhanced structural remodeling of granule cell axon terminals. Direct enzymatic degradation of ECM in the DG reactivated SOX11 in mature granule cells. At the behavioral level, fluoxetine mitigated stress induced fear generalization, an endophenotype of mood and anxiety disorders. This effect was phenocopied by ECM degradation, suggesting that ECM remodeling and granule cell rejuvenation are key mechanisms underlying the effects of fluoxetine, and possibly other antidepressants, on fear generalization.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

To do so, we assemble multiple bioinformatic steps in a single easy-to-use workflow. We combine state-of-the-art tools to detect transposable elements, annotate genomes, infer gene orthology relationships, compute divergence between sequences, infer evolutionary strata (i.e., footprints of stepwise extension of recombination suppression) and their structural rearrangements, and visualise the results.

The diameter of capillaries can be as narrow as two microns, imposing considerable deformations on neutrophils. Notably, capillary obstruction due to neutrophil retention causes vascular dysfunction and contributes to the pathogenesis of several diseases. However, the cellular mechanisms that allow neutrophils to migrate into small capillaries and to avoid retention remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate, both in vivo and in vitro, that capillary size does not influence neutrophil migration velocity. During migration into capillaries of different sizes, neutrophils maintain high speed, a phenomenon associated with a global actomyosin cytoskeleton rearrangement in response to confinement strength. In irregular capillaries, neutrophils rapidly adapt their cell contractility via the ROCK-MyoII pathway, which allows them to sustain their migration speed along the vessels despite changes in confinement. At the single cell level, inhibition of ROCK impairs actomyosin cytoskeleton rearrangement and reduces neutrophil migration speed within confined capillaries. At the collective level, ROCK inhibition hampers efficient neutrophil trafficking in a network of small capillaries, resulting in vessel obstruction. These findings reveal a unique capacity of neutrophils to rapidly and dynamically adapt their migration to the confinement strength of capillaries, an ability that might limit vascular dysfunction during inflammation.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Therefore, developing fungicides with novel action mechanisms is the most effective measure to manage resistance. Quinofumelin, a novel quinoline fungicide, exhibits exceptional antifungal activity against phytopathogens. However, there is currently no available information on its mechanism of action. Here, we used transcriptome and metabolome analysis to observe a co-enrichment pattern of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) within pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (PBP), identifying down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Exogenous uridine monophosphate (UMP), uridine or uracil (metabolites in PBP) successfully restored quinofumelin-induced inhibition of mycelial growth in Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium asiaticum. Additionally, the deletion of FgDHODHII was determined to be lethal; however, mycelial growth of {Delta}FgDHODHII mutants could be restored by adding UMP, uridine or uracil. These findings indicate that the deficiencies in FgDHODHII are functionally equivalent to complete inhibition of its activity by quinofumelin. Finally, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) results strongly support the precise interaction between quinofumelin and FgDHODHII. Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of de novo uracil biosynthesis as mechanism of action for quinofumelin while identifying FgDHODHII as its specific target.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

As a result, the response of many taxonomic groups to forest management is much less documented. With the advent of low-cost next generation barcoding approaches, it is now possible to envisage monitoring strategies based on molecular approaches, beyond metabarcoding/eDNA strategies that do not give access to species abundances and integrate species presence over largely unknown spatiotemporal scales. In this contribution, we demonstrate the use of massive DNA barcoding, also referred as megabarcoding, as a promising solution to overcome identification difficulties in demanding taxonomic groups. We performed a proof of concept study in a mountainous beech forest in the Massif Central, France. We sampled soil macrofauna at 25 sampling sites and managed to visually identify at the species level 130 out of the 1413 sampled individuals. Using megabarcoding on the 1283 remaining non-identified individuals, we managed to assign 1124 additional individuals to an operational taxonomic species at a competitive cost. We present the summary statistics of barcoding success in the different taxonomic groups encountered and in larvae versus adult individuals. We demonstrate that larvae individuals, which can hardly be visually identified at the species level, make a substantial contribution to overall macrofauna diversity. We finally showcase how this megabarcoding approach provides a concrete avenue for forest biodiversity monitoring, by assessing the cost and labour intensity of this approach.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Boolean networks are a popular modeling framework to understand the dynamic nature of GRNs. In the absence of reliable methods to infer the regulatory logic of Boolean GRN models, researchers frequently assume threshold logic as a default. Using the largest repository of published expert-curated Boolean GRN models as best proxy of reality, we systematically compare the ability of two popular threshold formalisms, the Ising and the 01 formalism, to truthfully recover biological functions and biological system dynamics. While Ising rules match fewer biological functions exactly than 01 rules, they yield a better average agreement. In general, more complex regulatory logic proves harder to be represented by either threshold formalism. Informed by these results and a meta-analysis of regulatory logic, we propose modified versions for both formalisms, which provide a better function-level and dynamic agreement with biological GRN models than the usual threshold formalisms. For small biological GRN models with low connectivity, corresponding threshold networks exhibit similar dynamics. However, they generally fail to recover the dynamics of large networks or highly-connected networks.

The systemic proteome response to cysteine feeding strongly suggests that Arabidopsis seedlings interpret accumulation of cysteine above a certain threshold as a signal for a biotic threat. Cysteine supplementation of Arabidopsis plants via the roots increases their resistance to the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae confirming the protective function of the cysteine induced defense pathways.

Building on our earlier studies, which uncovered proteasome-derived peptides with putative antimicrobial activity in the human proteome, here we systematically interrogated the proteasome, a large protein complex responsible for degrading and recycling damaged or surplus proteins, for additional antimicrobial peptides. Using deep learning, we systematically mined ProteasomeDB, a curated repository of proteasomal cleavage and splicing events, to predict antibiotic activity against 11 clinically relevant pathogens. This deep learning approach uncovered 59 candidate peptides (\"proteasomins\") with a median minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of [&le;]64LmolLLL1. Refinement yielded 21 sequence-diverse proteasomins, which were characterized for their physicochemical properties. These peptides were enriched in cationic residues and exhibit enhanced amphiphilicity, key attributes for disrupting microbial membranes. Dimensionality reduction via UMAP further showed that proteasomins are sequence-distinct from known antimicrobial peptides, underscoring their novelty and potential for unique mechanisms of action. Moreover, comparative analyses revealed that cis- and trans-spliced proteasomins exhibit similar predicted antimicrobial activities, suggesting that critical structural determinants remain conserved irrespective of splicing modality.

Intermediates are important for folding fidelity; however, their structures have remained elusive. Here, we have structurally characterised two coTF intermediates of an immunoglobulin-like domain by developing comprehensive 19F NMR analyses using chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), and protein engineering. We integrated these experimental data with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain atomistic structures of the folding intermediates on the ribosome. The resulting structures are distinguished by native-like folds initiated from either their N- or C-termini, and reveal multiple parallel folding pathways, which are structurally conserved within the protein domain family, in contrast to their in vitro refolding mechanisms.

We investigated how neurons in different cortical layers integrate visual input across space, with a focus on the linearity of spatial summation. Using intracellular recordings, we found that supragranular complex cells integrate input in a highly sublinear manner, in contrast to infragranular complex cells and simple cells, which exhibited near-linear summation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we employed a large-scale recurrent spiking model of cat primary visual cortex (V1). Modeling results point to the differential patterning of long-range horizontal connections -- particularly their targeting of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons -- as a potential source of the observed layer-specific integration properties.

We found longer phenological lags with experimental studies and native plants in flowering, likely due to more stressful environments associated with warmer and drier climate. Less forcing changes were mainly responsible for the smaller responses in leafing and flowering in boreal region (compared to temperate region) and in grass leafing (compared to trees and shrubs). Higher budburst temperatures also contributed to the smaller responses in flowering for experimental studies and with herbs and grasses. The effects of altitude, latitude, MAT, and average spring temperature change were minor (all combined <2.5% variations), while those of photoperiod and long-term precipitation were not significant in influencing spring phenology.

Building on these representations, we developed OmniEM, a U-shaped architecture for unified dense prediction that exceeds task-specific models in both image restoration and segmentation. In restoration benchmarks, OmniEM matches the performance of the EM-specific diffusion model while producing fewer hallucinations that could mislead EM interpretation. It also outperforms previous methods in both generalized mitochondrial segmentation and multi-class organelle segmentation. Furthermore, we demonstrate OmniEM\\'s integrated capability to generate high-resolution segmentations from low-resolution inputs, offering the potential to enable fine-scale subcellular analysis in legacy and high-throughput EM datasets. Together, EM-5M, EM-DINO, OmniEM, and an integrated Napari plugin comprise a comprehensive end-to-end toolkit for standardized EM analysis, advance cellular and subcellular understanding and accelerating the discovery of novel organelle morphologies and disease-related alterations.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Blood vessels and axons align outside the brain due to shared growth factors. However, this neuron-axon-synapse and vessel relationship within the brain white matter remains unclear, primarily due to the technical challenges of charting the complex trajectories of fiber tracts and the dense network of arteries. Consequently, the organizational logic and neurometabolic factors shaping white matter vasculature remain poorly understood. Here, we address these questions using high-resolution multimodal MRI, in vitro neuron density, and receptor autoradiography in macaque monkeys. In superficial white matter, vascularity exhibited parallel alignment with the cortical surface. This vascularity showed negligible dependence on overlying gray matter neuron density (R2 = 0.01), minimal dependence on white matter myelination (R2 = 0.10), and moderate correlation with receptor density (R2 = 0.27). These suggest an association of vascularity with energy demands and axonal branching. In deep white matter, axon geometry, density, and proximity to the cortical surface predict vascular volume with high precision (R2 = 0.62). Overall, these findings establish a relation between neuron-axon-synapse architecture and white matter vasculature in the primate brain, offering advances in understanding the organization and pathophysiology of white matter.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

FluRisk incorporates a curated database of over 1,000 experimentally validated molecular markers linked to key viral phenotypes, including mammalian adaptation, mammalian virulence, mammalian transmission, human receptor-binding preference, and antiviral drug resistance. Leveraging these markers, we developed three state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict human adaptation, mammalian virulence, and human receptor-binding potential, all of which demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional approaches such as BLAST, prior models, and baseline classifiers. In addition, a reference-based method was implemented to provide preliminary estimates of human transmissibility and resistance to six commonly used antiviral drugs. To facilitate broad accessibility and practical application, we developed a user-friendly web server that integrates both the molecular marker atlas and predictive tools for influenza virus phenotyping (available at: http://www.computationalbiology.cn/FluRisk/#/).

While some transcription factors (TFs) controlling pigment production and cuticle elaboration have been identified, little is known about the upstream developmental processes that first establish the petal regions where these regulators are active-the pre-patterning phase. Here, we developed a computational model of the evolution and development of petal patterns. We selected for gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that could generate the proximo-distal bullseye pattern of Hibiscus trionum petals, which resulted in robust patterning dynamics and a variety of bullseye proportions. We found that the evolution of these bullseye patterns was often accompanied by the spontaneous emergence of a third cell type at the boundary between the proximal and distal regions with a unique gene expression profile. These bullseye boundary cells appeared in the majority of simulations despite not being explicitly selected for, and we validated their presence experimentally in H. trionum petals. Although boundary cell types could emerge spontaneously without apparent function, our results indicate they were more often important for pattern formation and more evolutionarily stable when gene expression was noisy. This suggests that this emergent cell type contributes to reproducible bullseye formation by buffering against developmental variability. Altogether, these results illuminate the early steps of petal pattern formation and demonstrate how novel cell types arising spontaneously and repeatedly from selection on other features can help achieve developmental robustness.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

This curve emerges from two converging resonance states - homeostatic and circadian - that form a stable framework across conditions. Their relative phase and amplitude determine REM structure, producing bell-shaped, linear, or bimodal profiles. The model reproduces REM dynamics during regular sleep, extension, and post-deprivation recovery. Crucially, REM duration alone provides an experimentally accessible readout: simultaneously revealing circadian phase and quantifying sleep deficit as additional hours needed to restore homeostatic equilibrium. Together, these findings reposition REM duration from a descriptive marker to a mechanistic signal, linking sleep architecture to the dynamic interplay of internal regulatory systems.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Knowing kinesin-1 can be regulated via autoinhibition, does kinesin-1 exhibit autoinhibition on cargo, and could this regulate vesicular transport through 3D MT intersections in vitro? To answer this question, we compared liposome transport by ~10 nearly full-length kinesin-1 motors with KLC bound (Kin{Delta}C) versus constitutively active control (K543). In 3D MT intersections, Kin{Delta}C-liposomes terminate (48%), go straight (43%), but rarely turn (9%), starkly contrasting K543-liposomes which go straight (57%), turn (31%), but rarely terminate (12%). On single MTs, Kin{Delta}C-liposomes have reduced run lengths and detachment forces versus K543-liposomes, suggesting autoinhibition reduces MT engagement, as supported by 3-fold lower Kin{Delta}C MT landing rates versus K543, and mechanistic in silico modeling. Furthermore, kinesore, a small molecule that overcomes kinesin-1 autoinhibition, restores Kin{Delta}Cs MT engagement. Thus, we propose that partial kinesin-1 autoinhibition while cargo-bound may fine-tune cargo delivery to support physiological demands.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

In the germline, its precise regulation is critical to ensure both the elimination of aberrant cells and the maintenance of reproductive capacity. However, the molecular mechanisms that control apoptotic susceptibility in germline cells remain poorly defined. Here, we identify stand still (stil) as a female germline-specific regulator of apoptosis in Drosophila. Loss of stil leads to near-complete depletion of germline cells at the time of eclosion, associated with upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene reaper (rpr) and activation of caspase-dependent cell death. Reporter assays in S2 cells show that Stil directly represses rpr transcription through its N-terminal BED-type zinc finger domain. Despite the absence of stil, undifferentiated germline cells remain resistant to apoptosis. Analysis of publicly available chromatin data reveals that the rpr locus in these cells resides in a closed, H3K9me3-enriched chromatin state, suggesting a Stil-independent mode of transcriptional silencing. Together, our findings uncover a dual mechanism that protects the female germline from rpr-dependent apoptosis: active repression by Stil in differentiating cells and chromatin-mediated silencing in undifferentiated cells. This work provides new insights into the transcriptional and chromatin-based mechanisms that maintain germline cell identity and survival.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

This approach significantly increases the yield of glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) functional iPSC-platelets. However, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. Here, we reveal that GPIb iPSC-platelets retain high mitochondrial membrane potential, low phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, and active ATP-dependent flippases, preserving mitochondrial integrity and platelet functionality. In contrast, GPIb- platelets exhibit PS exposure, ADAM17 activation, and selective GPIb shedding. Notably, turbulent flow induces late-stage actin depolymerization, promoting even mitochondrial distribution within maturing imMKCLs and enhancing mitochondrial inheritance to iPSC-platelets.

Although this technique has seen occasional use in plants, optimization of the protocol to maximize functionality while minimizing organismal stress has not yet been established. Here, we provide evidence for successful implementation through the liquid immersion of seedlings in AHA or HPG-containing media that functions with significantly lower concentrations than the literature standard. Our approach splits acute exposure and incorporation phase of labelling to mitigate potential negative impacts of prolonged NCAA exposure without compromising effective enrichment capacity, and demonstrate that this results in an unperturbed growth phenotype for AHA-treated seedlings. Finally, we demonstrate the capacity of this modified approach to enrich newly synthesized proteins from the whole proteome under standard stress conditions.

The compound 4-[[2-[[5- (1H-indol-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]sulfanyl]acetyl]amino]benzoate (C35) was recently identified as a new potential antimicrobial agent for its ability to bind Hb and hamper its interaction with the staphylococcal hemophore IsdB in vitro. Here, we show that C35 inhibits S. aureus growth by specifically targeting the hemophore-driven iron acquisition system. Our findings confirm both the potential of C35 as a first-in-class protein-protein interaction inhibitor with antimicrobial activity, and the effectiveness of targeting hemophores as a strategy to inhibit S. aureus growth. To gain information for drug discovery purposes, the X-ray structure of Hb in the presence of the compound was solved. Unexpectedly, we discovered that, rather than the predicted binding pose, the molecule binds to tetrameric Hb in a cleft between the alpha subunits, stabilizing an R2 relaxed Hb conformation. This triggered further investigation of the effect of C35 on Hb functional properties, which showed a pronounced left-shift activity on oxygen binding curve (i.e., it strongly increases the Hb oxygen affinity). These results highlight C35 as a promising dual-acting compound with both antimicrobial activity and the ability to modulate Hb function through non-covalent stabilization of a high-affinity state.\n\nAuthor SummaryStaphylococcus aureus is a dangerous bacterium that can cause severe infections in humans. To grow and survive it needs iron, which it steals from our red blood cells by taking it from hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. In this study, we focused on a small molecule, called C35, that blocks the interaction between hemoglobin and a key bacterial protein involved in heme acquisition. We found that C35 strongly inhibits the growth of S. aureus when hemoglobin is the only available source of iron, showing a potential new method to starve the pathogen and consequently fight the infection. Surprisingly, we also found that C35 increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. This dual action makes C35 a unique molecule for future therapeutic development, with potential applications both as a new antimicrobial agent and in the treatment of diseases related to hemoglobin function.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

ChIP-seq of SMARCC2 demonstrated its binding to many other ASD risk genes involved in transcriptional regulation. Smarcc2 deficiency in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adolescent mice led to impaired working memory, with largely intact social and anxiety-like behaviors. Significant downregulation of genes enriched in synaptic transmission were found in PFC of Smarcc2-deficient mice by RNA-seq and qPCR profiling. In parallel, electrophysiological recordings uncovered the significant impairment of GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic currents in Smarcc2-deficient PFC pyramidal neurons. Smarcc2 bound to HDAC2, and Smarcc2 deficiency led to the reduced global histone acetylation and H3K9ac enrichment at synaptic gene Slc1a3 (EAAT1), Slc6a1 (GAT1), and Slc32a1 (VGAT) promoters.

However, objective intraoperative assessment of fixation quality remains challenging. Acoustic analysis of stem impaction sounds offers a promising tool for real-time evaluation, but its diagnostic accuracy and biomechanical correlation require further validation. Methods: Twelve formalin-fixed human femora were implanted with cementless Metha short stems under three predefined anchorage conditions: loose, optimal (fit), and fracture-inducing press-fit. Impaction sounds were recorded using calibrated microphones and processed via frequency-domain analysis. Relative micromotions were quantified under torsional loading to biomechanically assess primary stability. Results: Spectral markers reliably differentiated between anchorage states. The transition from loose to fit showed minimal spectral change, while fit-to-fracture was characterized by a significant increase in low-frequency energy (<2.5 kHz) and pronounced attenuation in high-frequency bands (>15 kHz). These acoustic signatures closely correlated with biomechanically measured micromotions, which showed a distinct hierarchy: fracture < fit < loose. Cluster permutation analysis confirmed statistically significant differences, particularly in the fracture group. Conclusion: This in vitro study demonstrates that frequency-based acoustic analysis can distinguish between stable, insufficient, and over-press-fit conditions during stem implantation.

B.", "abstract": "Precise regulation of ion channel biophysics is an essential life process that governs electrical signaling in excitable tissues. Many ion channels including voltage-gated Na+ channels (NaVs) exist in the membrane as clusters, which show distinct biophysical behavior not predicted by single-channel measurements. In both heterologous and native systems, we report that single-channel-based predictions significantly overestimated Na+ current (INa) amplitudes from multi-channel clusters. Computational modeling suggested that these observations could reflect interactions between adjacent channels, such as recently reported between NaVs, and identified specific biophysical consequences thereof. This updated model not only accurately predicted behaviors observed from NaV clusters and consequent cellular physiology, but also suggested the possibility that clustered NaVs may respond differently to use-dependent pharmacological agents. Experiments validated the latter prediction and further identified modulation of clustering as a novel approach to correcting macroscopic electrophysiological dysfunction resulting from NaV defects linked to life-threatening arrhythmias and seizures. Thus, our study not only motivates a fundamental revision of how ion channels behave when clustered but also highlights resulting biophysical effects as important considerations for pharmacology and a potential therapeutic target to address human disease.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Inter-individual differences in learning-related activation in different hippocampal subregions have been found to predict specific differences in memory abilities. The complexity of these relationships creates a setting that is ripe for theoretically informative investigation, but that can also lead to reports of spurious relationships that do not reflect underlying neurobiological associations. Across-study replication is therefore a critical first step toward understanding how differences in hippocampal activity drive individual differences in memory ability. In the domain of verbal memory, Wig et al. (2008) identified a negative relationship between task-induced activation in pHPC and out-of-scanner verbal memory test performance. Replicating this result in an independent sample of 86 participants, we identified the same negative correlation between pHPC activation during a Lithuanian word learning task and out-of-scanner California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) performance. This replication represents a critical step toward understanding how pHPC supports verbal memory by answering the basic question of whether the relationship can be reliably observed.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, understanding the complex interactions between cerebrovascular health and brain function is crucial for unraveling the pathophysiology of psychosis. This study investigates the developmental trajectory of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) compared to healthy controls, and its association with psychosis susceptibility. Using a longitudinal data-set of resting-state fMRI, we mapped voxel-level CVR across development. We found significant and early CVR impairments in 22q11.2DS, and in particular in those who later developed positive psychotic symptoms (PPS+). These impairments were evident within the anterior cingulate cortex, frontal lobes, and globi pallidi (GB). We propose that the pattern of CVR reduction presenting early during childhood is possibly linked to blood brain barrier impairment. A decrease in CVR during childhood and within the frontal regions and GB was predictive of subsequent development of positive psychotic symptoms (PPS), which often occurs during adolescence in 22q11.2DS patients. These findings suggest that cerebrovascular health is critical for normal brain development, particularly in regions like the striatum, which are vulnerable to vascular damage due to their anatomical features. These results underline the potential of CVR as an early biomarker for psychosis vulnerability, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to mitigate neurodevelopmental disruptions of cerebrovascular health in 22q11.2DS.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

In this study, we propose that regions of the language network are coupled to one another through subspaces of shared linguistic features. To test this idea, we developed a model-based connectivity framework to quantify stimulus-driven, feature-specific functional connectivity between language areas during natural language comprehension. Using fMRI data acquired while subjects listened to spoken narratives, we tested three types of features extracted from a unified neural network model for speech and language: low-level acoustic embeddings, mid-level speech embeddings, and high-level language embeddings. Our modeling framework enabled us to quantify the stimulus features that drive connectivity between regions: early auditory areas were coupled to intermediate language areas via lower-level acoustic and speech features; in contrast, higher-order language and default-mode regions were predominantly coupled through more abstract language features. We observed a clear progression of feature-specific connectivity from early auditory to lateral temporal areas, advancing from acoustic connectivity to speech- and finally to language-driven connectivity. These findings suggest that regions of the language network are coupled through feature-specific communication channels to facilitate efficient and context-sensitive language processing.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Research suggests that natural human language is processed hierarchically across brain regions over time. However, attempts to characterize this computation have thus far been limited to tightly controlled experimental settings that capture only a coarse picture of the brain dynamics underlying human natural language comprehension. The recent emergence of LLM encoding models promises a new avenue to discover and characterize rich semantic information in the brain, yet interpretable methods for linking information in LLMs to language processing over time are limited. In this work, we develop a low-rank tensor regression method to decompose LLM encoding models into interpretable components of semantics, time, and brain region activation, and apply the method to a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset in which subjects listened to narrative stories. With only a few components, we show improved performance compared to a standard ridge regression encoding model, suggesting the low-rank models provide a good inductive bias for language encoding. In addition, our method discovers a diverse spectrum of interpretable response components that are sensitive to a rich set of low-level and semantic language features, showing that our method is able to separate distinct language processing features in neural signals. After controlling for low-level audio and sentence features, we demonstrate better capture of semantic features. Through use of low-rank tensor encoding models we are able to decompose neural responses to language features, showing improved encoding performance and interpretable processing components, suggesting our method as a useful tool for uncovering language processes in naturalistic settings.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in high-throughput time-lapse imaging techniques have transformed our ability to track such growth dynamics, yielding comprehensive anatomical datasets of neuronal morphologies at unprecedented rates. However, analyzing these complex datasets using traditional morphometrics requires manual feature selection, which leads to costly and biased quantification. To overcome these limitations, we applied the Topological Morphology Descriptor (TMD) to extract topological representations of neurons from time-lapse imaging of two cell types within the well-established Drosophila larval sensory dendritic arborization (da) system. We first used TMD to accurately classify the developmental trajectory of Class I da sensory neurons across embryonic and larval stages. However, TMD alone failed to distinguish class-type-specific morphology in Class III neurons, particularly in detecting altered branching rate dynamics in genetically modified mutants. To address this, we extended TMD to a Temporal Topological Morphology Descriptor (TTMD) to incorporate temporal dynamics. TTMD successfully classified mutations in Drosophila Class III da neurons, capturing altered branching rate dynamics in mutant phenotypes. These findings highlight the power of TTMD as an unbiased, scalable framework for analyzing neuronal growth dynamics and linking structural development to genetic and functional variation.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

The brain is much better at adapting to the multiplicity of stimuli and outcomes than current generations of computers, artificial neural deep learning and reservoir model architectures. Yet, at first glance the brain appears to use a fixed anatomical architecture to perform the necessary huge variety of computations. But evolution's boldest trick is that in fact the brain's effective connectivity is constantly being updated through neuromodulation to allow the rich repertoire of computation. Inspired by this, we created a whole-brain model using empirical neurotransmitter maps modulating the underlying local regional dynamics. This NEMO (neurotransmission modulated) whole-brain model is able to flexibly compute the full task repertoire and associated functional connectivity of the neuroimaging data from 971 healthy participants. For each individual we defined a measure of 'brain computability' as the fitting of the NEMO whole-brain model to all tasks performed by the individual. Importantly, brain computability correlates with both behavioural performance on individual tasks and with a general behavioural measure of intelligence. Overall, our proposed unifying NEMO framework offers a natural way to sculpt different brain dynamics in a fixed brain architecture to compute the rich repertoire of tasks required for surviving and thriving.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

G.; Chacron, M. J.; Khadra, A.", "abstract": "Burst firing is an important property of neuronal activity, thought to enhance sensory encoding. While previous studies show significant differences in burst firing between in vivo and in vitro conditions, how burst firing contributes to neural coding in vivo and how it is modulated by underlying biophysical mechanisms when neurons are under active synaptic bombardments remains poorly understood. Here, we combined intracellular recordings and computational modeling to investigate how cellular and synaptic mechanisms can explain the in vivo firing activity of electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) pyramidal cells in Apteronotus leptorhynchus. We developed a biophysically detailed compartmental model incorporating voltage-gated currents, NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx, calcium-activated SK channels, calcium handling, and stochastic synaptic inputs to reproduce in vivo firing activities of ELL pyramidal cells. Specifically, using bifurcation analysis, we identified dynamical transitions between quiescent, tonic, and bursting regimes, governed by interactions among SK conductance, NMDA receptor activation, and applied current. Model parameters were optimized against in vivo data, accurately reproducing action potential waveforms and temporal dynamics, including characteristic bimodal interspike interval distributions reflecting intra- and inter-burst intervals. We further developed a modified Hindmarsh-Rose model incorporating dual adaptation variables and stochastic noise. This simplified phenomenological model successfully captured burst firings comparable to those observed in the biophysical model and recorded data, while replicating diverse firing patterns observed across the population. Finally, parameter sensitivity analysis revealed slow adaptation dynamics and noise intensity as key determinants of spiking variability within cells. Overall, our modeling results demonstrate that in vivo bursting arises from synergistic interactions between intrinsic conductances (e.g., NMDA-SK coupling), calcium mobilization, and synaptic stochasticity, offering a potential reconciliation for discrepancies with in vitro firing activity. The models provide mechanistic insights into how background synaptic activity modulates burst firing and validate simplified frameworks for studying population-level dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Comparisons of AD PPS in different data sets of healthy agers and centenarians showed that centenarians have stronger genetic protection against AD compared to individuals without familial longevity.

However, the genetic protection was of modest size: the average increase in AD PPS was approximately one additional protective allele per 5 years of gained lifetime. Additionally, we show that the higher AD PPS was associated with better cognitive function and decreased mortality.

We quantified isochrony in an untrained expression of musicality: improvised songs from non-musician adults and children.

Isochrony was expressed in non-musicians' improvised songs, and in children's improvised songs to a comparable degree. In contrast, both juvenile and adult zebra finches produced songs with less isochrony than chance.

Despite their broad applicability, significant drawbacks limit access to many of these drugs, including: i) high manufacturing costs; ii) administration via time consuming infusions; iii) frequent dosing, sometimes even daily; and iv) requirements for low temperature storage. MYO Technology was developed to overcome these barriers. The MYO Technology platform consists of therapeutic-encoding plasmid DNA (pDNA), and a proprietary medical device for intramuscular injection and delivery of electrical pulses. These pulses enable the in vivo electroporation of muscle cells and uptake of injected pDNA, leading to the production, secretion, and delivery of the therapeutic protein into peripheral circulation. MYO Technology offers several advantages over standard delivery of therapeutic proteins; pDNA manufacturing is a simpler and less specialized process compared to protein manufacturing, and pDNA is very stable and lacks most cold chain requirements. Furthermore, administration using MYO Technology takes only a few minutes, and the serum level of a therapeutic protein can potentially be maintained for many months without the need for redosing. Incretin receptor agonists (IRAs) are a class of therapeutic proteins that have recently come to prominence as powerful weight and glucose control drugs, and are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Semaglutide and tirzepatide, currently the most widely used within this class, are both potent molecules, but have a short half-life, requiring weekly administration by subcutaneous injections. Moreover, since their clinical benefits rapidly disappear upon treatment cessation, T2D and obese patients may have a life-long dependency on IRAs, and the requirement for weekly injections can negatively affect the quality of life and the adherence to therapy, as well as create a significant financial burden. Therefore, increasing the interval between injections has become one of the major goals in the field. Here, we present our preclinical studies on the delivery of IRAs with MYO Technology. Animal proof of concept studies demonstrate that MYO Technology-delivered IRAs are functional, and efficacious in promoting long lasting weight and glucose control in mouse models of diet induced obesity. Moreover, engineering the IRAs to facilitate blood brain barrier penetration further enhances treatment efficacy, with benefits persisting well beyond six months following a single administration. Together, these findings highlight MYO Technology potential to transform care for patients with T2D and obesity by enabling long-lasting therapeutic effects with minimal dosing, ultimately improving quality of life and treatment adherence.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Although heterogeneous in its manifestations and severity, SLE involves chronic inflammation along with sustained autoantibody production. The root causes and pathophysiology of the inflammation and breaches of tolerance are incompletely understood, but neutrophils are thought to be important elements of the pathophysiology. Type I interferons (IFN) in the bloodstream and an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signature in circulating leukocytes, including neutrophils, are common features in many patients. Earlier work with unfractionated peripheral blood cells of SLE patients has provided evidence of increased levels of transcripts derived from transposable elements (TEs). We sought to elucidate the relative extents of de-repression of different TE classes in neutrophils of SLE patients, and to explore the relationships between the increased ISG and TE expression as well as their correlation with the severity of the SLE disease. Published RNA-seq data obtained from neutrophils (also termed polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or PMN) were analyzed with pipelines designed to detect TEs in samples from 23 patients with SLE and healthy controls (n = 10). SLE samples were sub-divided into \"IFN-positive\" (IFNpos, n=12) and \"IFN-negative\" (IFNneg, n=11) patients, as defined in the original study based on gene expression analysis. An independent interferon-regulated gene signature was also determined for each sample. In PMN of IFNpos SLE patients, expression of ISGs and TE families were increased compared to healthy controls (HC) and IFNneg SLE patients. No TE families showed significantly increased expression in SLE patients pre-stratified as IFNneg. Increased expression of a majority of individually-mapped TEs correlated with upregulated expression of nearby genes. The majority (~80%) of upregulated TEs were present in introns of upregulated genes, and ~67% of these upregulated genes were ISGs. Of the ~20% of mapped TEs that were in the introns of genes whose expression did not change significantly, only ~28% were ISGs. Analyses of all SLE patients identified a strong correlation between expression of several specific TE families and disease activity assessed at the time of the visit. Detailed inspection of individually mapped TEs in the introns of ISGs showed a remarkable correlation of high TE expression with selective but partial intron retention as well as with annotated splicing alterations of the flanking exons in these ISGs. Neutrophils of SLE patients independently pre-classified as being IFNpos have increased expression of multiple TE classes and families, but this manifestation is not present in patients of the IFNneg stratum. The expression of only some TE families correlated with the disease activity, showing a complex relationship between TEs and SLE.

However, the anatomic locations occupied by these populations (i.e. alveoli, pleura, airways, or arteries) have not been fully defined. Objectives: To determine the distribution of transcriptionally-defined human macrophages in the major anatomical lung structures and to identify alterations in their distribution and programming induced by cigarette smoking. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on lung tissue from eight human donors without pulmonary disease (four smokers and four nonsmokers). Microdissection was used to isolate distinct pulmonary anatomical structures from each lung: alveoli, pleura, airways, and arteries. Transcriptional profiles of subpopulations of interstitial macrophages (IMs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs) were analyzed based on their anatomical structure of origin and smoking status. Measurements and Main Results: Five major IM and five AM subpopulations in human lungs are identified. We demonstrate significant differences in the accumulation patterns of each macrophage subset within anatomical structures, though each subset was detected in each. Immunofluorescent microscopy confirmed anatomical structure-specific accumulation patterns of IMs. Conclusions: In this study, we highlight key differences in the accumulation of lung macrophage subpopulations in anatomical structures but find programming within macrophage subpopulations is largely conserved, regardless of structure of origin or smoking status. We also detect populations of inflammatory AMs and IMs which accumulate within the airways, but not the alveolar parenchyma, of human cigarette smokers. We introduce a novel three-tiered hierarchy nomenclature to distinguish transcriptionally defined human lung IM subsets as 1) Monocyte-like vs Antigen Presenting, 2) Quiescent vs Inflammatory, and 3) FOLR2high vs FOLR2low. This study is the first to report the fractional accumulation of human lung macrophage subsets by lung anatomical structure.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Dysregulation of mechanisms that maintain these membrane extensions lead to foot process effacement, proteinuria, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Building on our previous work that showed WNK1 kinase activity is necessary for the maintenance of normal biomechanical properties of glomeruli and podocyte foot process architecture, we tested the hypothesis that WNK1 kinase activity affects the structure of podocyte foot processes through modulation of actomyosin activity and focal adhesion complexes. Using a WNK1 kinase specific inhibitor, we determined by immunofluorescence microscopy of nascent focal adhesions, podocyte membrane spreading/extensions, and NMII paralog localization and extent of activation calculated from quantification of phosphorylated myosin, that all were sensitive to WNK1 kinase activity. Moreover, biochemical evidence of WNK1 kinase activity-dependent signalosomes supports a role for WNK1 in the maintenance of podocyte foot processes, and sarcomere-like structures (SLSs) that are induced in models of podocyte injury. Using primary and immortalized podocyte cell lines developed from control and Col4a3-/- Alport Syndrome model mice, we measured WNK1 kinase activity-dependent improvement in properties of injured podocytes in vitro. Physiological relevance of WNK1 kinase activity-dependent structural maintenance of podocyte foot processes was confirmed by significant acute proteinuria measured in response to WNK1 inhibition in vivo. Collectively, the results provide evidence that WNK1 kinase signalosome activity that includes formation of nascent focal adhesions and regulation of NMII localization and activity at membrane protrusions and extensions, are necessary for physiological maintenance of slit diaphragms.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

We previously published data showing that CTCF constitutive knockdown causes mitotic failure, but the mechanism remains unknown. To determine the role of CTCF in mitosis, we used a CRISPR CTCF auxin inducible degron cell line for rapid degradation. CTCF degradation for 3 days resulted in increased failure of mitosis and decreased circularity in post-mitotic nuclei. Upon CTCF degradation CENP-E is still recruited to the kinetochore and there is a low incidence of polar chromosomes which occur upon CENP-E inhibition. Instead, immunofluorescence imaging of mitotic spindles reveals that CTCF degradation causes increased intercentromere distances and a wider and more disorganized metaphase plate, a disruption of key functions of the pericentromere. These results are similar to partial loss of cohesin, an established component of the pericentromere. Thus, we reveal that CTCF is a key maintenance factor of pericentromere function, successful mitosis, and post-mitotic nuclear shape.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Cell division generates the necessary number of cells, while differentiation creates distinct cell identities, forming tissues and organs. The transcription factors SOX2 and PAX6 specify neuroepithelial cells, the earliest neural progenitor cells (NPCs) during brain development. How lineage specification is coordinated with the cell cycle is not fully understood. Here, we show that PAX6 expression occurs during a narrow time window after neural induction of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Flow cytometry analyses and time-lapse imaging show that PAX6 expression starts during the G2 phase. We identify a novel 500-bp PAX6 promoter that drives its G2-specific expression. PAX6 expression is independent of known regulators of cell-cycle-dependent transcription, suggesting the existence of a novel mechanism. S-phase block by hydroxyurea prevents PAX6 expression and differentiation into NPC. Thus, NPC fate specification is coupled to cell cycle progression and occurs after the completion of DNA replication.

Despite the remarkable efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, only a subset of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients respond and many eventually progress, underscoring the need to develop novel combination therapies. The interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME), a complex niche including cells of the innate and adaptive immune system, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), vascular cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a vital role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Using fate mapping, we previously identified a novel subpopulation of resident vascular stem cells derived from vascular smooth muscle cells, designated AdvSca1-SM (vascular Adventitial location, Stem cell antigen-1 expression, SMooth muscle origin) cells. AdvSca1-SM cells are the predominant cell type responding to vessel wall dysfunction and their selective differentiation to myofibroblasts promotes vascular fibrosis. SMC-to-AdvSca1-SM cell reprogramming is dependent on SMC induction of the transcription factor KLF4, and KLF4 is essential for maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. The function of AdvSca1-SM cells in LUAD tumorigenesis has not been explored. Using an orthotopic immunocompetent mouse model of LUAD, we demonstrate that AdvSca1-SM cells are a major component of lung tumors, significantly contributing to cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Compared to AdvSca1-SM cells, CAFs have altered ECM gene expression with a reduction of a stemness signature. AdvSca1-SM-specific genetic ablation of Klf4 altered their phenotype resulting in inhibition of communication between cancer cells and CAFs, decreases in innate immunosuppressive populations, and increased T cell infiltration into the tumor. Targeting this population may represent a novel strategy to improve the response to immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Since ulcerative colitis (UC), a significant risk factor for CAC, is rising in prevalence worldwide, an integrative approach is essential to identify potential triggers linking inflammation to cancer. In the present study, we investigated the role of the gut microbiome using Winnie mice, a UC-like model with a relevant missense mutation in the Muc2 gene. Upon transfer from a conventional (CONV) to a specific-pathogen-free (SPF) facility, Winnie mice exhibited a more severe colitis phenotype, and notably, spontaneous CAC as early as four weeks of age, which progressively worsened over time. In contrast, CONV Winnie developed only mild colitis but with no overt signs of tumorigenesis. Notably, when rederived into germ-free (GF) conditions, SPF Winnie mice were protected from colitis or colon tumor development, indicating an essential role for the gut microbiome in the initiation and progression of CAC in these mice. Using shotgun metagenomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics, we identified a distinct pro-inflammatory microbial and metabolic signature that potentially drives the transition from colitis to CAC. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), using either SPF Winnie or WT (Bl/6) donors into GF Winnie recipients, demonstrated that while colitis developed regardless of donor, only FMT from SPF Winnie donors resulted in CAC, revealing a microbiota-driven, host-specific susceptibility to tumorigenesis in Winnie mice. Our studies present a novel and relevant model of CAC, providing further evidence that the microbiome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of CAC, thereby challenging the concept of colon cancer as a strictly non-transmissible disease.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluated the role of NETs in inducing necrosis and metastasis in CRC. We found that the numbers of neutrophils primed to form NETs were elevated in the circulation of patients with CRC as compared to controls. CD177Low neutrophils were also elevated, and they showed reduced extravasation capacity with intact ability to form NETs. The extent of necrosis correlated with metastasis (stage IV disease), independent of tumor size, in our human cohort. In both human and murine CRC tumors, necrotic regions were characterized by neutrophil infiltration and NET accumulation, and NET aggregates were observed in the vasculature next to the necrotic regions. Single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analysis of human CRC and liver metastases revealed that necrotic tumors activate pathways associated with increased metastatic potential, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition. Using a mouse model of DNA mismatch repair proficient CRC, we found neutrophil infiltration and NETs increased with tumor progression. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of NET formation decreased necrosis and metastasis, and importantly enhanced chemotherapy efficacy. Altogether, our findings show that NET formation in human CRC is a key feature of tumor necrosis and it is associated with metastasis, and further suggest that preventing NET formation may offer clinical benefits to CRC patients.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

And what are the white matter pathways that mediate structural connectivity in support of functional object use? Here we show that the left inferior parietal cortex, a region within the dorsal visual pathway, exerts a direct effect on neural responses in ventral occipital-temporal cortex during visual processing of manipulable objects. We studied a series of consecutively enrolled participants in the pre-operative phase of their neurosurgical care (N = 109) with lesions principally distributed throughout the left hemisphere. Participants completed an object processing category localizer functional MRI experiment in which they viewed images of manipulable objects, animals, faces, and places. We then used Voxel-based Lesion-Activity Mapping (VLAM), a technique in which functional responses in a region-of-interest are used to predict variance in voxel-wise lesion incidence throughout the brain. In the VLAM analyses performed here, we found that lesions to the left anterior intraparietal sulcus and left supramarginal gyrus, two inferior parietal regions known to support object-directed grasping and manipulation, respectively, cause reduced neural responses for manipulable objects (compared to faces, places and animals) in the fusiform gyrus. Parietal lesions do not affect neural responses during visual processing of places in the same region of the fusiform gyrus, even though places elicit stronger responses in the fusiform gyrus than manipulable objects. Seventy-five of 109 participants took part in a common diffusion MRI protocol, permitting a connectome-wide analyses relating white matter fiber integrity to the strength of functional responses for manipulable objects in the left fusiform gyrus.

Allocation to intracellular components might evolve from direct selection on specific subcellular constituents that affect cell size indirectly, or instead as a byproduct of selection on cell size per se. We used transmission electron microscopy of spermatozoa to quantify investment in pseudopods, mitochondria, and membranous organelles (MOs) from C. macrosperma and C. nouraguensis, related species divergent in sperm size. We demonstrate that C. macrosperma allocates more to mitochondria, in both total and relative terms, consistent with larger sperm cells having greater energetic demands associated with longevity, adhesion, and motility functions. Similar relative pseudopod sizes between species, however, is consistent with an optimal pseudopod:cell body ratio. MO size and distribution patterns within cells implicate C. macrosperma having lower relative investment in MO contributions to seminal fluid, thus excluding increased investment in MOs and pseudopod as drivers of sperm gigantism in C. macrosperma. We conclude that cell size per se likely represents the primary target of selection in the evolution of sperm gigantism, with mitochondrial traits likely evolving as a consequence of increased energetic demands of giant sperm cells.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

We here show that OmpA from Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) uses membrane vesicles for its delivery to the outer mitochondrial membrane during Ctr infection. Using a number of imaging and fractionation techniques, we show that OmpA during infection reaches mitochondria and is inserted into mitochondrial membranes. Purified membrane vesicles (MV) from Ctr-infected cells contained OmpA. When added to uninfected cells, MV fused with mitochondrial membranes, causing the interaction of OmpA with BAK and the cytosolic retro-translocation of BAX. MV addition to uninfected cells protected the cells against apoptosis. We propose a structural model of this BAK inhibition by OmpA that reenacts the inhibition of BAK by the mitochondrial porin VDAC2. The results provide evidence that the porin from Chlamydia, as well as the structurally similar porin from the related Simkania, specifically exploits its relationship to mitochondrial porins to protect the infected cell against apoptosis and to enable intracellular growth of the bacteria in human cells.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Alongside well-characterized nascent adhesions, focal adhesions (FAs), fibrillar adhesions (FBs) and hemidesmosomes, a new class of IACs, reticular adhesions (RAs), have been identified. RAs, initially described as flat clathrin lattices formed by integrin V{beta}5, lack association with actin and are devoid of FAs markers. The physiological role of RAs in normal and tumor cells is still incompletely understood and requires further investigation. Previously, we analysed IACs of two melanoma cell lines, MDA-MB-435S and RPMI-7951, grown under long term culture conditions, and demonstrated that both cell lines preferentially use integrin V{beta}5 for adhesion. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of RAs in these two melanoma cell lines that differ in their ability to form FBs. To determine RAs composition, we treated cells with actin polymerisation inhibitor cytochalasin D (CytoD) which disrupts FAs, allowing isolation of RAs, which were analysed by MS-based proteomics, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Known RA-associated proteins, including the AP-2 adaptor complex, disabled homolog 2 (DAB2) and Numb were identified in both lines, along with talin2. Notably, we also detected the presence of KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains protein (KANK2) in RA isolates. Proximity ligation analysis following CytoD-induced actin disruption confirmed the proximity of KANK2 and talin2 in RAs. We then investigated the effect of talin2 or KANK2 knockdown on RAs composition. While both talin2 and KANK2 are located in RAs, neither is essential for RA formation. Talin2 knockdown led to a reduction in RA components abundance in both cell lines. In MDA-MB-435S cell line, KANK2 produced a similar effect, mirroring the functional interaction of talin2 and KANK2 in FAs. However, in RPMI-7951 cells, KANK2 knockdown had no significant effect on RA components abundance. This discrepancy likely reflects the preferential localization of KANK2 in FBs and underscores the differing roles of talin2 and KANK2 in V{beta}5-mediated FAs across the two cell lines.

However, placebo-controlled trials of COX-2 inhibitors have revealed a cardiovascular hazard. This has been attributed to suppression of COX-2 dependent cardioprotective prostaglandins (PGs), especially prostacyclin, produced by endothelial (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC) 1-3. Upstream of these effects, we have found that the COX-2 antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PACERR interacts with discrete RNA binding proteins to mediate the cell specific COX-2 response to both anti- [high-density lipoprotein (HDL)] and pro-inflammatory [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] stimuli. PACERR exerts its action both in cis and in trans, controlling the expression of COX-2 and the cholesterol transport genes, ABCA1 and ABCG1. When cells are exposed to HDL, PACERR is transcribed, leading to the release of bound histone acetyltransferase p300 and its relocation to the promoter of COX-2 which is then transcribed leading to PG formation. In concert, PACERR also releases heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) which relocates to the ABCA1 and ABCG1 gene loci, controlling mRNA alternative splicing and subsequent cholesterol efflux to HDL. Silencing PACERR, with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), augments the COX-2 and cholesterol efflux in response to HDL. In response to HDL, PACERR associates with its neighboring gene, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2/PLA2G4A) both interacting with an enhancer element affecting cPLA2 transcriptional activation and escorting the cPLA2 protein to the nuclear membrane. There, it releases arachidonic acid, further activating COX-2 but limiting ABCA1 and ABCG1 by suppressing the formation of the LXR/RXR heterodimers required for their transcription when cholesterol efflux is no longer required 4. In response to LPS, PACERR controls the action of the NF{kappa}B repressive protein, I{kappa}B{zeta}. When PACERR is silenced in a humanized mouse model with the ASO, I{kappa}B{zeta} is free to bind to the NF{kappa}B site in the COX-2 promoter, suppressing transcription, PG formation and systemic inflammation. In summary, these studies reveal dual and complementary mechanisms by which PACERR modulates PG production by COX-2. In response to HDL, it enhances production of prostacyclin whereas it dampens production of the PG response to LPS.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

It is also highly valued as a traditional health supplement in many South Asian countries. It is not surprising that this yellow turmeric has attracted strong attention for its therapeutic potential in recent years. Nevertheless, the molecular and cellular targets of curcumin remain unknown. Here, we took a novel imaging-based approach to determine the intracellular localization of curcumin using the model organism fission yeast Schizosacchromyces pombe. We took advantage of the intrinsic fluorescence of curcumin to track its whereabout in yeast cells. Live fluorescence microscopy revealed for the first time that curcumin, at a concentration as low as one micromolar, formed a narrow circumferential band around the equatorial plane of dividing cells within 10 minutes of addition. The intensity of this band increased proportionally to the concentration of curcumin and gradually over time. Inhibition of cell division by the cdc25 temperature-sensitive mutation inhibited the curcumin band. During cytokinesis, curcumin co-localized with the integrated plasma membrane protein Bgs1 at the cleavage furrow, not with either the contractile ring or the septum markers. Besides fission yeast, such equatorial curcumin band was found in the dividing cells of two other yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. Our study thus discovered that this widely used yellow turmeric targets the cleavage furrow of dividing yeast cells, suggesting that curcumin may have anti-fungal therapeutic potential (223 words).", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

However, its long-term effects on neurodevelopment of pain pathways, remain a significant concern. The midbrain is a core region that plays a central role in pain processing and opioid-mediated analgesia. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to study gene expression in 107,427 midbrain single cells from adolescent mice neonatally exposed to either saline, morphine, or morphine with the probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis (B. infantis). We found broad alterations in transcriptomics within neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells. Analysis of differentially regulated genes revealed down regulation of HOX genes and upregulation of pathways related to neurotransmitter signaling and pain in adolescence that were neonatally treated with morphine. Interestingly, neonatal probiotic supplementation mitigated these morphine-induced alterations on the transcriptome. This study presents the first single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of the adolescent midbrain following neonatal morphine exposure and probiotic intervention. These findings offer new insights into the neurodevelopmental impact of early opioid exposure and highlight the therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

SNR for OPMs was increased by up to 205% compared to EEG and by up to 40% compared to conventional MEG. Likewise, the signal coherence across trials of OPMs was increased by up to 61% compared to EEG and by up to 23% compared to conventional MEG.

However, the field continues to face a reproducibility crisis, partly due to the lack of comprehensive, systematic, and verifiable documentation of genetic constructions. Although most cloning procedures are deterministic and theoretically describable in a complete and unambiguous way, published methods are typically described in a form free narrative, making them laborious to reproduce and assess for completeness. Tools like the Python package Pydna support programmable and reproducible cloning strategies but require coding expertise, which can be a barrier for some users. To address this, we developed Pydnaweb and dnaudit, two open-source and complementary web tools that build on Pydna. Pydnaweb offers simulation of unit operations such as PCR and restriction digestion providing results in text format. These results can be collected and combined to form complex cloning strategies in a bottom-up approach. Dnaudit can verify such collections for internal consistency and that the cloning strategy meet a specific goal such as the expression of a protein sequence. The tools are design for a low barrier of entry, and they can be used separately. This workflow enables fully automated validation, providing a no-code, reproducible solution for documenting and sharing molecular cloning workflows. These tools ease compliance with FAIR principles and align with emerging standards for the transparent and reproducible sharing of scientific methods and data.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

For non-white researchers, this process involves complex negotiations that remain understudied, particularly among those stereotyped as \"model minorities.\" This qualitative study examines how Asian and Asian American early-career scientists navigate their racial and cultural identities within scientific writing and publication processes. Drawing on interviews with 23 participants who engaged with the Journal of Emerging Investigators, we identified two primary approaches to identity navigation: \"spurring,\" wherein racial and cultural backgrounds catalyze research questions and scientific inquiry, and \"siloing,\" wherein these identities are deliberately compartmentalized during formal scientific writing. Using an integrated theoretical framework combining cultural community wealth, narrative identity, and model minority discourse, we analyzed how participants strategically deployed cultural resources while navigating institutional expectations. Our findings reveal that while participants drew upon familial capital to inform research interests and occasionally acknowledged reflexivity, most also practiced disciplinary compartmentalization and adhered to perceived scientific norms of objectivity. This tension demonstrates how early-career scientists negotiate competing cultural scripts while developing professional identities. These findings have significant implications for science education, suggesting the need to help students recognize cultural backgrounds as valuable resources rather than sources of bias, address myths of pure objectivity, and provide models of successful identity integration in scientific work. By documenting these navigation strategies, we contribute to understanding both individual agency and institutional constraints in scientific practice, particularly for students from backgrounds historically underrepresented in STEM fields.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce ElectraON and ElectraOFF, a pair of green fluorescent eFRET-based GEVIs engineered by incorporating a photostability-enhanced derivative of the bright monomeric fluorescent protein mBaoJin with Ace opsin variants. Critically, Electras demonstrate over 6-fold improved photostability compared to state-of-the-art eFRET GEVIs, pAce, and Ace-mNeon2, under one-photon illumination, while characterized by bright green fluorescence, millisecond kinetics, and good membrane localization. This enhanced stability translates to a 3- to >10-fold extension in functional recording duration, maintaining reliable spike detection in both cultured neurons in vitro and sparsely labeled neurons in the awake mouse cortex in vivo. We demonstrated sustained in vivo recordings exceeding 30 minutes, with instances surpassing one hour. Furthermore, Electras show functionality under scanless two-photon excitation in cultured cells.

Using in-vivo single-unit recordings during baseline and fear extinction learning, we found ELS-induced dysfunction was characterized by reduced neuronal firing, rigid spike-timing, and weakened functional connectivity, all predicting impaired extinction learning. ACTH treatment prevented these deficits, preserving dynamic spike-timing, flexible connectivity, and network organization. Advanced graph neural network modeling identified neuronal features predictive of cognitive outcomes, revealing potential biomarkers broadly relevant to other developmental disorders.

Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) studies have revealed abnormal brain activity in affected individuals, with anxiety and symptom duration potentially exacerbating these alterations. This study applied multivariate pattern analysis to differentiate resting-state EEG signals between FM patients and healthy controls across frequency bands associated with pain processing, while incorporating state and trait anxiety scores. It also examined differences between patients with short- and long-duration symptoms and identified the most relevant scalp regions contributing to the models. Fifty-one female participants (25 FM patients, 26 controls; aged 35-65) were included. Patients were classified into short-term (12) and long-term (13) groups. EEG was recorded and power spectral density values were extracted and normalized to be used to train machine learning classifiers. Anxiety scores were included in the patient-control analysis. Haufe transformed weights were computed to determine key scalp contributions. The models successfully distinguished patients from controls and between FM subgroups, with accuracies exceeding 0.70 across all frequency bands. Including anxiety scores substantially improved classification, with accuracies reaching 0.99. These findings highlight significant differences in resting-state EEG activity between patients and controls, and between FM subgroups, underscoring the relevance of emotional and neural factors. Frequency-specific alterations in pain-related scalp regions support the view of disrupted pain processing in FM.

Although prior efforts have attempted to parallelize expensive likelihood-based approaches by partitioning data or running multiple sampling replicas in parallel, such strategies fail for algorithms requiring efficient communication between processes.

Our framework supports frequent yet lightweight inter-thread and inter-processor communication, making it well-suited for modern parallel architectures.

Bombykol, instead, binds to the same receptor through hydrogen bonds, with significantly lower potency. The unique ability of aldehydes to establish a reversible covalent bond allows moths to unequivocally distinguish between compounds that differ only in the presence of a single hydrogen atom.

This sensitization is induced by prior stimulation of epidermal cells but not nociceptors, suggesting that epidermal cells modulate nociceptor function in response to heat exposure. Indeed, we found that Drosophila epidermal cells are intrinsically thermosensitive, exhibiting robust heat-off responses following warming to noxious temperatures as well as responses to cooling below comfortable temperatures. Further, we found that epidermal heat-off calcium responses involve influx of extracellular calcium and require the store-operated calcium channel Orai and its activator Stim. Finally, epidermal heat-off responses and heat-evoked nociceptive sensitization exhibit similar temperature dependencies, and we found that Stim and Orai are required in epidermal cells for heat-evoked nociceptive sensitization.

This study aimed to clarify whether EP damage causes motor dysfunction in two disease models. Methods: EP-related motor dysfunction was investigated by inducing localized unilateral EP damage in Long-Evans rats using a stereotactic kainic acid (KA) injection. Motor function was assessed using a single-pellet reaching task pre-injection and on postoperative days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Immunohistochemical staining for NeuN, somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin was conducted to quantify damage and its correlation with motor outcomes.

Injury sites were classified into the IC, dorsomedial region from the IC, ventral lateral region from the IC, and EP, and their volumes were measured. Measured volumes were analyzed for correlations with motor function assessments. Results: KA-induced EP damage significantly reduced reaching success rates on postoperative day 2 compared to those in the control group (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that reaching success rates on day 28 positively correlated with the numbers of remaining NeuN-positive and SST-positive neurons (p<0.05).

Lecanemab-Fab8D3 (Lec-Fab8D3), a bispecific anti-amyloid beta (A{beta}) antibody engineered for enhanced brain delivery, holds potential as a companion immunoPET imaging diagnostic with the novel lecanemab immunotherapy. This study aimed to compare three radionuclides--zirconium-89 (89Zr), copper-64 (64Cu), and iodine-124 (124I)--for PET imaging with Lec-Fab8D3 to study its in vivo brain distribution and evaluate its potential as an AD companion diagnostic. Methods: Lec-Fab8D3 was conjugated to DFO* or NODAGA for 89Zr and 64Cu radiolabeling, respectively, or directly radioiodinated with 124I. PET imaging was performed in the Tg-ArcSwe mouse model of A{beta} pathology and wild-type (WT) littermates at multiple time points post administration of the radiolabeled antibody, followed by ex vivo biodistribution, autoradiography, and A{beta} quantification to assess brain uptake, specificity, and distribution of the radiolabeled Lec-Fab8D3. Results: Radiolabeled Lec-Fab8D3 variants showed retained binding properties with high radiochemical purity and yields. PET imaging demonstrated cortical brain uptake of all three tradiotracers in Tg-ArcSwe mice, with [89Zr]Zr-DFO*-Lec-Fab8D3 and [124I]I-Lec-Fab8D3 showing the best discrimination between Tg-ArcSwe and WT mice at 48-72 h post-injection. The highest absolute brain retention, combined with a lower brain-to-cerebellum ratio, was observed in both Tg-ArcSwe and WT mice that received the radiometal-labeled (89Zr and 64Cu) antibody, likely due to the residualizing nature of radiometals. Ex vivo analyses confirmed PET findings, and immunostaining demonstrated co-localization of Lec-Fab8D3 with A{beta} deposits. Conclusions: ImmunoPET imaging with bispecific Lec-Fab8D3 enables specific detection of brain A{beta} pathology in an AD mouse model. 89Zr was superior to 64Cu due to a more compatible half-life, while 124I displayed higher regional contrast than both radiometals, despite lower overall brain signal. The combined findings from radiometal- and iodine-based immunoPET will enhance our understanding of intra-brain distribution of bispecific antibodies. Furthermore, this highlights the importance of the choice of radiolabeling strategy and how it will impact the outcome of immunoPET with bispecific A{beta} antibodies.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

While some reported successful conversion, others disputed this, citing a lack of neuronal gene expression as evidence of failed reprogramming. This interpretation was further challenged, attributed to incomplete PTBP1 inactivation, fueling ongoing controversy. Mechanistic understanding of the conversion, or the lack thereof, requires investigating, in conjunction with lineage tracing, the effect of Ptbp1 loss of function in mature astrocytes on RNA splicing, which has not yet been examined. Here, we genetically ablated PTBP1 in adult Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 Ai14 mice to determine whether lineage traced Ptbp1 knockout astrocytes exhibited RNA splicing alterations congruent with neuronal differentiation. We found no widespread induction of neurons, despite a minuscule fraction of knockout cells showing neuron-like transcriptomic signatures. Importantly, PTBP1 loss in mature astrocytes induced splicing alterations unlike neuronal splicing patterns. These findings suggest that targeting PTBP1 alone is ineffective to drive neuronal reprogramming and highlight the need for combining splicing and lineage analyses. Loss of astrocytic PTBP1 is insufficient to induce neuronal splicing, contrasting with its well-known role in other non-neuronal cells, and instead affects a distinct astrocytic splicing program.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

In response to alveolar injury, resting alveolar fibroblasts differentiate into fibrotic fibroblasts that express high levels of collagens. However, what role, if any, proliferation plays in the accumulation of fibrotic fibroblasts remains unclear. Through EdU incorporation, genetic lineage tracing, and single cell RNA sequencing, we resolve the proliferation dynamics of lung fibroblasts during post-injury fibrogenesis. Our data show substantial DNA replication in progeny of alveolar fibroblasts in two models of pulmonary fibrosis. By genetically labeling individual cells, we observe clonal expansion of alveolar fibroblast descendants principally in regions of fibrotic remodeling. The transcriptome of proliferating fibroblasts closely resembles that of fibrotic fibroblasts, suggesting that fibroblasts can first differentiate into fibrotic fibroblasts and then proliferate. Genetic ablation of proliferating fibroblasts and selective inhibition of cytokinesis in alveolar fibroblast descendants significantly mitigates pulmonary fibrosis and rescues lung function. Furthermore, fibroblasts in precision-cut lung slices from human fibrotic lungs exhibit higher proliferation rates than those in non-diseased lungs. This work establishes fibroblast proliferation as a critical driver of pulmonary fibrosis and suggests that specifically targeting fibroblast proliferation could be a new therapeutic strategy for fibrotic diseases.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Communication between the Microbiome and Gut-Brain-Axis (mGBA) is crucial for maintaining organismal physiology during ovarian growth and development(1). Given the elevated iron levels in the blood, we investigated how mosquitoes maintain systemic iron homeostasis and revealed striking parallels to iron deficiency disorders in mammals. We demonstrate that the synergistic transcriptional regulation of Ferritin (Fer) and Transferrin (Trf) plays a crucial role in follicle development and egg maturation. Silencing both genes using RNA interference (RNAi) led to severe reproductive impairment, including ovarian arrest in 40% of females, a 50% reduction in oocyte numbers, and reduced first instar larval size. These e phenotypes correlate with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered serotonin (5-HT) receptor expression in the brain, likely driven by gut microbiota imbalance, and hence neurological signalling modulation due to disrupted iron metabolism. The unexpected discovery of a transcript encoding a novel hepcidin (AcHep) protein that was previously unknown in any insect or mosquito species, and surprisingly, its modest enrichment in the fat-body of the Fer+Trf knockdown mosquito, suggested that it may be involved in the maintenance of the systemic iron homeostasis, as in mammals. Summarily, our data provide the first molecular evidence in insects that iron metabolism disorders can impair mGBA communication and compromise reproductive outcomes, mirroring effects observed in mammalian iron deficiency. This study expands our understanding of iron's systemic roles and opens new avenues for targeting mosquito reproduction in vector control strategies.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

K.; Dunham, M. J.", "abstract": "In the natural world, genetic isolation between closely related species is often maintained by direct F1 hybrid sterility or hybrid breakdown in subsequent generations. This phenomenon is also observed in microorganisms within species of the Saccharomyces clade, including the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Members of Saccharomyces intermate and historical hybridization events have left genomic footprints, but these hybrids are themselves sterile and produce very few viable offspring. Previous work suggests a main cause of F1 hybrid sterility is the action of mismatch repair machinery. The sequence divergence between two parent Saccharomyces species--from ~10% to ~20%--is recognized by the cell as an aberrant attempt to recombine nonhomologous chromosomes during meiosis I, leading to massive nondisjunction and aneuploidy. Deletion of mismatch repair machinery improves fertility in hybrids of S. cerevisiae and its sister species S. paradoxus but leads to increased mutation accumulation during normal mitotic growth. To overcome this drawback, conditional alleles that specifically repress expression of mismatch repair machinery during meiosis have been applied in S. cerevisiae x S. paradoxus hybrids with success. Here, we describe the application of the meiotic null system to a different hybrid: S. cerevisiae x S. uvarum. The system does not increase hybrid fertility likely due to increased sequence divergence and chromosomal translocations, but mass spore recovery and flow cytometry enable the recovery of near-haploid offspring which inherit an assortment of parental chromosomes. These populations of mixed hybrid genomes can be leveraged in phenotypic studies to further understand the effects of hybrid genomes on organismal fitness.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Here we present TEATIME (estimating evolutionary events through single-timepoint sequencing), a novel computational framework that models tumors as mixtures of two competing cell populations: an ancestral clone with baseline fitness and a derived subclone with elevated fitness. Using cross-sectional bulk sequencing data, TEATIME estimates mutation rates, timing of subclone emergence, relative fitness, and number of generations of growth. To quantify intratumor fitness asymmetries, we introduce a novel metric--fitness diversity--which captures the imbalance between competing cell populations and serves as a measure of functional intratumor heterogeneity. Applying TEATIME to 33 tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we revealed divergent as well as convergent evolutionary patterns. Notably, we found that immune-hot microenvironments constraint subclonal expansion and limit fitness diversity. Moreover, we detected temporal dependencies in mutation acquisition, where early driver mutations in ancestral clones epistatically shape the fitness landscape, predisposing specific subclones to selective advantages. These findings underscore the importance of intratumor competition and tumor-microenvironment interactions in shaping evolutionary trajectories, driving intratumor heterogeneity.

Flavored ENDS are popular among teens who vape, however, the possible cardiac electrophysiological harm of inhalation exposure to flavored ENDS are not fully understood. Objective: To test if inhalation exposure to flavoring carbonyls in E-liquids compromises mitochondrial integrity, increases oxidative stress, and leads to cardiac electrophysiological toxicity. Methods: Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS), flow cytometry, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) measurement, in-vivo programmed electrical stimulation (PES), and multielectrode array (MEA) were used in atrial like HL-1 myocytes, hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes, and mice overexpressing mitochondrial catalase (mCAT). Results: We compared the toxicity of E-vapor exposure from 30 differently flavored E-liquids in HL-1 cells using apoptotic annexin V flow cytometry. Most E-liquids were toxic. We identified the major flavoring carbonyls in these E-liquids and quantified their concentrations using GC/MS. Linear regression analysis showed that toxicity correlated with carbonyls concentration. Using flow cytometry of CellROX and TMRE staining, HL-1 cells exposed to flavored E-vapor showed increased reactive oxygen species and depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, exposure decreased OCR in these cells. In-vivo inhalation exposure to flavored E-vapor increased the inducible ventricular tachycardia duration in WT but not in mCAT mice compared to controls. MEA recordings in hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes exposed to flavored E-vapor, with or without nicotine, resulted in changes in the spontaneous beating rate. Conclusions: Inhalation exposure to flavored ENDS negatively affects ventricular electrophysiology, in part via adverse mitochondrial remodeling, and increased oxidative stress.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Moreover, we describe a strategy that significantly reduces curtaining effects. Finally, we report a precise routine to target a lamella with a precision of approximately 1 micrometer in X,Y and Z. Together, these modifications considerably reduce contamination risk and preparation time, making cryo-lift-out techniques more accessible for routine structural biology applications on any type of tissue. Here, we demonstrate the power of our technique by targeting several specific wall structures that are of crucial importance for root function in plants and that were previously inaccessible to cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET).

Among these, multi-member gene families of cell surface proteins are of interest because they can act as neuron-specific identification/recognition tags in combinations and contribute to circuit assembly in complex brains through their heterophilic or homophilic interactions. Recently, a multi-protein interactome has been described between the Beat and Side families of IgSF proteins. Here, we use the publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets and newly generated gene trap transgenic driver lines to probe the in vivo spatial expression pattern of the beat/side gene families in odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) and their synaptic target projection neurons (PNs). Our results revealed that each ORN and its synaptic target PN class expresses a class-specific combination of beat/side genes, hierarchically regulated by lineage-specific genetic programs. Though ORNs or PNs from closer lineages tend to possess more similar beat/side profiles, we also found many examples of divergence from this pattern among closely related ORNs and closely related PNs. To explore whether the class-specific combination of beats/sides defines ORN-PN matching specificity, we perturbed presynaptic beat-IIa and postsynaptic side-IV in two ORN-PN partners. However, disruption of Beat-IIa-Side-IV interaction did not produce any significant mistargeting in these two examined glomeruli. Though without affecting general glomerular targeting, knockdown of side in ORNs leads to the reduction of synaptic development. Interestingly, we found conserved expression patterns of beat/side orthologs across ORNs in ants and mosquitoes, indicating the shared regulatory strategies specifying the expression of these duplicated paralogs in insect evolution. Overall, this comprehensive analysis of expression patterns lays a foundation for in-depth functional investigations into how Beat/Side combinatorial expression contributes to olfactory circuit assembly.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Nonetheless, these substances are ubiquitous and pose significant risks to the environment, wildlife, and human health. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), which was previously one of the most commonly utilized PFAS, has prolonged half-life in both humans and the environment. Despite the cessation of its production, PFOS remains one of the prevalent contaminants amongst PFAS. Recent research demonstrates that PFOS is relatively resistant to elimination from the human body and accumulates to a greater extent in older adults. PFOS has been shown to affect the nervous system and its functions, although the intricate mechanisms underlying its toxicity remain largely obscure. Earlier studies utilizing Caenorhabditis elegans indicated that dopaminergic neurons are particularly vulnerable to PFOS neurotoxicity, with glutathione (GSH) playing a role in mitigating neurodegeneration. Curiously, none of the antioxidant treatments evaluated, including N-acetyl-cysteine, produced favorable outcomes, despite N-acetyl-cysteine being a precursor to GSH. This study investigates the GSH synthesis pathway to elucidate critical mechanisms. We assessed the effects of GSH precursors and intermediates on PFOS neurotoxicity. The GSH precursors, cysteine, glutamate, and the combination of cysteine and glutamate did not demonstrate beneficial effects.

Here, we conducted a comparative biochemical, molecular, and proteomic analysis of hippocampal tissue from 90 individuals spanning control, LATE-NC, ADNC, and ADNC+LATE-NC groups to assess the impact of cryptic exon (CE) inclusion, phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology (pTDP-43), and AD-related pathologies ({beta}-amyloid, and tau) on the proteome. ADNC+LATE-NC cases exhibited the highest burden of CE inclusion as quantified by measuring the levels of known TDP-43 regulated CEs within eight transcripts: STMN2, UNC13A, ELAVL3, KALRN, ARHGAP32, CAMK2B, PFKP, and SYT7. While CE levels correlated with pTDP-43 pathology, they were more strongly correlated with each other, suggesting that the molecular signature of CE inclusion may serve as a more sensitive measure of TDP-43 dysfunction than pTDP-43 pathology alone. Unbiased classification based on the relative abundance of these eight CEs stratified individual cases into low, intermediate, and high CE burden subtypes, largely independent of {beta}-amyloid and tau pathology. Proteome-wide correlation analysis revealed a bias toward reduced protein levels from genes harboring TDP-43-regulated CEs in cases with high cumulative CE burden. Notably, proteins significantly decreased under high CE burden included canonical STMN2, ELAVL3, and KALRN, as well as kinesin proteins that are genetically associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Evidence suggests that this pre-sleep phase actively contributes to sleep initiation and quality. Nonetheless, individuals can sometimes fall asleep without preparation, even under undesirable circumstances. These abrupt transitions into sleep can have severe consequences, particularly in high-risk environments. Although progress has been made in identifying neuronal populations controlling sleep-wake states and mechanisms regulating cortical oscillations during sleep, little is known about the natural processes that govern the pre-sleep phase, under baseline conditions and following sleep loss. Here, we examine factors regulating pre-sleep behaviors using environmental and behavioral manipulations, video recordings, machine-learning-based tracking, and EEG-EMG analysis in freely-behaving mice. We focus on nest-building, a key pre-sleep behavior, and assess its modulation by time of day and sleep deprivation. We find that mice are highly motivated to build nests during the light phase but show reduced motivation during most of the dark phase. Sleep deprivation significantly suppresses pre-sleep nest-building and promotes the direct initiation of sleep. Varying amounts of sleep deprivation, from 2-6 hours, uniformly suppress nest-building. This suppression is not due to stress, as mice exposed to acute restraint stress engage robustly in nest-building. Our findings provide insight into processes regulating the transition from wakefulness to sleep. Understanding pre-sleep regulation has important implications for treating sleep-onset difficulties-prevalent in insomnia and predictive of cognitive decline, and for mitigating risks associated with uncontrolled sleep onset in high-stakes situations.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Currently, the human myopia epidemic is estimated to affect nearly 3 billion persons, yet experimental refractive error research is still hampered by the lack of a plausible theoretical mechanism explaining how the eye detects defocus and grows to minimise error (emmetropization). Applied lens defocus, either positive or negative, to animals including human, induces rapid changes in both refraction and axial length. Such changes have been linked to the rate of transfer of fluid from the vitreous chamber across the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE). However, the theoretical basis of sensing the sign of defocus still eludes, as does the physiological operationalisation of this defocus signal. We propose that the signal for the sign of defocus is contained within the pattern of temporal modulation of light on the retina during the myriad saccadic eye movements performed every minute. This pattern is generated by a combination of the ocular point spread function for the defocused eye, narrow cone photoreceptor acceptance of light and the modification of photoreceptor directionality by the retinal shear that accompanies saccadic eye movements. Thus, under conditions of defocus, performing a saccade across a simple visual grating produces an out of focus dynamic stimulus pattern on the retina which is sawtooth-like, the profile being dependent on the sign of defocus. Positive lens defocus induces a fast-OFF/slow-ON sawtooth-like luminance modulation transfer function, while negative lens defocus results in a fast-ON/slow-OFF temporal pattern. Such patterns produce relative incremental or decremental changes in the trans-epithelial electrical potential and consequent changes in fluid absorption across the RPE. Thus, rearing with positive lens defocus is associated with an increase in trans-epithelial potential, increasing trans-epithelial absorption and decreasing vitreous chamber size, while rearing with a negative lens decreases the trans-epithelial electrical potential and decreases RPE fluid absorption, increasing eyeball size. In both cases, retinal images become more in-focus, and the refractive error tends to zero. The resultant is emmetropization, modifying eyeball size in response to applied defocus in a stable negative feedback fashion.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "Objective: Power-to-power cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is a novel method to index the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions between brain rhythms, including high frequency oscillations (HFOs). This research evaluates this promising method's capacity for seizure detection with intracranial EEG. Seizures can be conceptualized as composites of different electrographic patterns including (1) spike, (2) ripple-on-spike, and (3) ripple-on-oscillation. This study also performs a basic CFC analysis of each of these components which has potential to further the understanding of epileptogenic processes. Methods: In this study, deep learning networks including Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) are trained to detect seizures and help characterize CFC patterns for these three common seizure components. The analysis uses intracranial EEG (iEEG) records from the ieeg.org (Mayo Clinic files) database. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) seizures (n = 120) from 26 patients were analyzed along with segments of background activity. Power-to-power coupling was calculated between all frequencies 1-250 Hz pairwise using the EEGLAB toolbox. CFC matrices of seizure and background activity were used as training or testing inputs to the autoencoder. Results: The trained network was able to recognize background and seizure segments (not used in training) with a sensitivity of 90.2%, specificity of 96.8% and overall accuracy of 93.4%. The three seizure components (spike, ripple-on-spike, ripple-on-oscillation) were also observed to have unique CFC signatures. Conclusions: The results provide evidence both for (1) the relevance of power-to-power coupling (PPC) for TLE seizure detection in iEEG, as well as (2) there existing unique PPC signatures of three common seizure components.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

From flies to humans, social experience affects various cognitive and behavioral processes. Here, we use the fruit flies to show that group housing suppresses male courtship vigor as a result of a decrease in the evoked neural responses in courtship circuits. Bulk tissue RNAseq and single-cell RNAseq from fru- and dsx-positive cells from grouped or isolated male brains revealed that social isolation increases the number of fru- and dsx-positive neurons, elevates fru transcript levels in specific clock neurons, and dsx transcript levels throughout the brain. Knocking down fruM in the fru-positive neurons in brains decreases courtship in isolated males to levels comparable to those of group-housed males. Furthermore, group housing increases the expression of sr and Hr38 genes encoding neural activity-induced transcription factors in most neurons within social circuits. We found that knocking down sr in fru positive neurons effectively eliminates the impact of social experience by increasing courtship in group-housed males. Importantly, social experience also alters the expression of FruM/DsxM target genes regulating circadian states throughout the brain. Disrupting circadian gene function also diminishes the effect of group housing on courtship. Our findings suggest that group housing/social enrichment suppress courtship by reprogramming the circadian arousal state, whereas courtship-elevating effects of social isolation rely on changes in FruM expression and function. These results are significant as they point to modulation of circadian arousal state as a possible central strategy for mediating the pleiotropic effects of social experience on organismal responses.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

While 3D Z-stack imaging offers high-resolution data, the complexity of 3D structures makes direct interpretation and manual annotation challenging and time-consuming, especially for large datasets. Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is a common strategy to create more interpretable 2D representations, but this inevitably leads to artificial overlaps between structures, significantly hindering accurate automated segmentation of individual instances by conventional methods or standard deep learning tools. To address this critical challenge in 2D projection analysis, we developed DeMemSeg, a deep learning pipeline based on Mask R-CNN, specifically designed to segment overlapping membrane structures, called prospore membranes (PSMs) during yeast sporulation. DeMemSeg was trained on a custom-annotated dataset, leveraging a systematic image processing workflow. Our optimized model accurately identifies and delineates individual, overlapping PSMs, achieving segmentation performance and derived morphological measurements that are statistically indistinguishable from expert manual annotation. Notably, DeMemSeg successfully generalized to segment PSMs from unseen data acquired from gip1{triangleup} mutant cells, capturing the distinct morphological defects in PSMs. DeMemSeg thus provides a robust, automated solution for objective quantitative analysis of complex, overlapping membrane morphologies directly from widely used 2D MIP images, offering a practical tool and adaptable workflow to advance cell biology research.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a critical role for the {beta}-tubulin isotype Tubb6 in the formation of motile cilia in Xenopus epidermal multiciliated cells (MCCs). Tubb6 mRNA is selectively expressed in MCCs, and its protein product localizes to ciliary axonemes. Loss of Tubb6 leads to a marked reduction in cilia number and length, resulting in defective MCC function. In contrast, mono-motile cilia in the gastrocoel roof plate are unaffected by Tubb6 depletion, suggesting a selective requirement for ciliogenesis in MCCs.

A promising set of newer approaches are based on genetic data, which can be cheaper to obtain and less invasive than information from more direct observation. One of these approaches is close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR), a type of method that uses genetic data to identify kin pairs and estimates population size from these pairs. Although CKMR methods are promising, a major limitation to using them more broadly is a lack of CKMR models that can deal with spatial heterogeneity both in population density and sample effort. We introduce a simulation-based approach to CKMR that uses spatially explicit individual-based simulation in concert with a deep convolutional neural network to estimate population sizes. Using extensive simulation, we show that our method, CKMRnn, is highly accurate, even in the face of spatial heterogeneity, and demonstrate that it can account for potential confounders such as unknown population histories.

S.", "abstract": "Background: Truncating variants in desmoplakin (DSPtv), are a leading cause of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), often presenting with early fibrosis and arrhythmias disproportionate to systolic dysfunction. DSP is critical for cardiac mechanical integrity, linking desmosomes to the cytoskeleton to withstand contractile forces. While loss-of-function is implicated, direct evidence, both for DSP haploinsufficiency in human hearts and for the impact of mechanical stress on cardiomyocyte adhesion, has been limited, leaving the pathogenic mechanism unclear. Methods: We analyzed explanted human heart tissue from patients with DSPtv (N=3), titin truncating variants (TTNtv, N=5), and controls (N=5) using RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry. We generated human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) harboring patient-derived or CRISPR-Cas9 engineered DSPtv to model a range of DSP expression levels. Using a 2D cardiac muscle bundle (CMB) platform enabling live visualization of cell junctions, we developed an assay to assess cell-cell adhesion upon heightened contractile stress in response to the contractile agonist endothelin-1. CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) was used to confirm the role of DSP loss, and CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) was tested for therapeutic rescue. Results: Compared to both control and TTNtv hearts, DSPtv human hearts exhibited reduced DSP at both the mRNA and protein level, as well as broadly disrupted desmosomal stoichiometry. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses implicated cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, and inflammatory pathways. iPSC-CM models recapitulated DSP haploinsufficiency and desmosomal disruption. DSPtv CMBs showed normal baseline contractile function. However, they displayed marked cell-cell adhesion failure with contractile stress (75% failure vs. 8% in controls, p<0.001). Adhesion failure was prevented by the myosin inhibitor, mavacamten. CRISPRi-mediated DSP knockdown replicated this susceptibility to adhesion failure. Conversely, CRISPRa robustly increased DSP expression and rescued cell-cell adhesion failure in DSPtv CMBs (9% failure post-CRISPRa, p<0.001 vs. un-treated). Rescue occurred even when only the DSPII isoform was upregulated in a model with biallelic DSP transcript 1 loss of function. Conclusions: DSP haploinsufficiency is the major cause of DSP cardiomyopathy with a primary consequence of conferring vulnerability to cardiomyocyte cell-cell adhesion failure under heightened contractile stress. Transcriptional activation of DSP reverses this defect in preclinical models, establishing proof-of-concept for a potential therapeutic strategy in DSP cardiomyopathy.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

New method: We describe an analysis pipeline that classifies cognitive states using a 2-camera set-up for video-based estimation of attentiveness and screen engagement in nonhuman primates performing cognitive tasks. The procedure reconstructs 3D poses from 2D labeled DeepLabCut videos, reconstructs the head/yaw orientation relative to a task screen, and arm/hand/wrist engagements with task objects, to segment behavior into an attentiveness and engagement score. Results: Performance of different cognitive tasks were robustly classified from video within a few frames, reaching >90% decoding accuracy with [&le;]3min time segments. The analysis procedure allows setting subject-specific thresholds for segmenting subject specific movements for a time-resolved scoring of attentiveness and screen engagement.

Variance heterogeneity (VH), including skewness, outliers, and multimodal distributions, offers a powerful but underused lens for detecting latent etiological structures relevant to prognosis and therapeutic response. Methods: A major barrier to VH analysis is the fragmented landscape of available methods, many of which rely on normality assumptions that biological data frequently violate.

To address this, a web-based resource, Structome-AlignViewer, is introduced in this work for evaluating the quality of structure-aware alignments through both spatial mapping of alignment columns to protein structures and quantitative confidence scoring. Confidence is computed from pairwise structural substitutions between adjacent inputs and normalized within each alignment to highlight relatively well-supported columns. To provide broader context, thousands of alignments from established structural classification systems were analysed, allowing for an empirical comparative statistic to be derived to assess alignment quality.

H.", "abstract": "Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations that include hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) modeled at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) level of theory are a valuable tool for accurately modeling the translational and rotational diffusion of macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. A major drawback to the inclusion of HIs in BD simulations is their computational expense, and an obvious way to consider reducing the expense of BD-HI simulations is to include a cutoff such that HIs beyond a certain distance are omitted. Unfortunately, a naive attempt to implement such a scheme usually leads to the RPY diffusion tensor becoming non-positive definite, which has the consequence that it becomes impossible to compute the correlated random displacements required by the Ermak-McCammon BD-HI algorithm. Here I show that a simple approach can be used to overcome this problem and implement a distance-based cutoff scheme that is guaranteed to lead to a diffusion tensor that is positive definite. The method involves only a straightforward distance-based scaling of the original RPY terms, and allows a seamless transition to be made between BD simulations that neglect HIs entirely and simulations that include HIs at the full RPY level of theory.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

This combination treatment is based on the premise that AR directly regulates expression of DNA repair genes, leading to synergy between PARP and AR inhibition. Despite some promising preclinical evidence, this combination therapy has shown limited efficacy in patients with homologous recombination (HR)-proficient tumors. To investigate this discrepancy between preclinical and clinical results, we profiled the effects of PARP inhibition in prostate cancer models in the presence or absence of AR inhibition. Surprisingly, AR inhibition impaired response to PARP inhibitors in castration-sensitive cells and had no effect on response in castration-resistant cells. AR inhibition also did not regulate DNA repair in either the castration-resistant or castration-sensitive setting. Instead, we find that cell cycle progression is required for response to PARP inhibition in homologous-recombination proficient prostate cancer.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

DNA was isolated from 71 primary tumours and 37 CTC samples. Mutation profiles were generated using the PNA-LNA molecular switch. KRAS mutations were detected in 26 primary tumours (36.6%) and 13 CTCs (26.8%), while BRAF mutations were observed in 19 primary tumours (26.8%) and 7 CTCs (19%). No significant correlation was observed between mutation status and clinicopathological parameters in primary tumours. However, KRAS G12V mutations in CTCs significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (p=0.002), overall pathological stage (p=0.005), and lymphovascular invasion (p=0.034). BRAF V600E mutation status showed no significant clinicopathological associations. Validation of the PNA-LNA molecular switch against Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) showed 89% concordance with p-values < 0.001 for both genes.

In this study, we developed a novel framework integrating genome-scale metabolic modeling (GSM) with machine learning to identify metabolic biomarkers and vulnerabilities in PDAC. We addressed the inherent class imbalance in cancer datasets by generating synthetic healthy samples using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), implementing a three-step biological filtration process to ensure their validity. Our approach achieved 94.83% accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and cancerous metabolic states. Systems-level analysis revealed three key dysregulated pathways: heparan sulfate degradation, O-glycan metabolism, and heme degradation. We identified impaired lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as a potential contributor to PDAC pathogenesis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed association between lysosomal storage disorders and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, we found that nervonic acid transport (MAR00336) was the most discriminative reaction between healthy and cancerous states, with gene-level analysis highlighting FABPs, SLC27As, ACSLs, and ACSBGs as key molecular drivers of metabolic reprogramming in PDAC. Overall, our multi-level approach connected genetic drivers to functional metabolic consequences, revealing coordinated upregulation of fatty acid transport and activation processes. These findings enhance our understanding of PDAC metabolism and present potential therapeutic targets, demonstrating the value of integrated computational approaches in cancer research.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

We developed a patient-derived explant multi-modal imaging pipeline, which demonstrated that cell-intrinsic PARP inhibitor accumulation is highly variable, both between patients and within tumours. Spatial transcriptomics revealed enrichment of apoptotic and lysosomal signatures in \"high-drug\" regions. Rucaparib, an intrinsically fluorescent PARP inhibitor, accumulates heterogeneously at the single-cell level, with \"rucaparib-high\" cells demonstrating increased drug response relative to \"rucaparib low\".

It is well-recognized that patients vary in their AF progression, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This work, performed in a sheep AF-model, aimed to identify atrial redox and energetic status differences between animals developing stable AF (AF-S) versus those resistant to AF-stabilization (AF-R). Methods: AF was monitored with telemetry and maintained with bursts of atrial tachystimulation whenever sinus rhythm resumed. Electrophysiological remodeling was assessed via contact mapping. Structural remodeling was described by histology. Proteomic, metabolomic, enzymatic and bioenergetic remodeling were evaluated using frozen left atrial appendage (LAA) tissues and isolated LAA mitochondria. Healthy young rats were used to investigate if an induced metabolic challenge could stabilize AF episodes upon transesophageal atrial tachypacing challenge. Results: AF-S sheep developed stable AF (>24-hours self-sustained) after 13 days on average, whereas AF-R sheep failed to develop self-sustained AF despite 120 days of electrically-maintained AF. Contact mapping and histological analysis revealed similar electro-structural remodeling in both groups. Metabolic analysis showed significant differences in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes activities and a 45% increase in AF-S LAA succinate content versus AF-R. AF-S mitochondria showed abnormal mitochondrial succinate oxidation, associated with a significant 20% decrease in ATP synthesis rate, 22% increase in ROS emission and mitochondrial inner membrane hyperpolarization. The ratios of ATP to ADP, NAD+ to NADH, and Complex I/II were disturbed in AF-S compared to AF-R. Calculated mitochondrial NAD+ to NADH ratios suggest a reduced state of in-vivo AF-R mitochondria compared to the oxidized state of AF-S. Exogenous succinate was metabolized when incubated with rat atrial cardiomyocytes and altered redox balance, while intravenous succinate stabilized atrial arrhythmias induced by tachypacing in vivo. Conclusions: Sheep resistant to AF-progression showed specific TCA cycle, energetic and redox adaptations compared to animals that developed self-sustained AF. In this animal model, mitochondrial TCA cycle remodeling and associated redox and energetic responses determined the resistance to AF domestication, with potential relevance to identify new mechanistic determinants of AF progression in humans.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Cell and tissue features are not commonly used as chironomid markers to detect toxicity, but they could be extremely helpful in identifying acute and chronic effects of pollutants. The nervous system is an excellent cellular candidate since it is reactive to toxic substances. However, a detailed description of the chironomid nervous system is required prior to considering it as a candidate for a cellular toxicity marker. The present study describes the central ganglia, nerves, axons, and the neuromuscular system of Chironomus vitellinus (Freeman, 1961) to facilitate its use as a model organism in environmental studies. We find that the structure of the C. vitellinus central nervous system is identical to that observed in other Chironomus larvae. We then focused our study on the first abdominal segment and labeled the 31 hemi-segmental muscles according to a nomenclature based on their position and orientation. We also characterized their innervation and assigned the nerves a nomenclature based on their terminals location in the muscle tissue. Finally, we investigated the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) throughout this segment and defined four types of NMJs illustrating their great variability in size and shape. We selected a model NMJ, VEL 2, and quantified its mean bouton number and muscle size.

According to the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), unconscious sensory information remains relatively confined to sensory cortex and should not be capable of interacting with other modalities until it is broadcast into the (conscious) global workspace comprising late (>300ms) frontal-parietal activation. The ventriloquist effect is a classical multisensory integration phenomenon that refers to the misperception of sound location towards concurrent visual stimulation, such as perceiving the voice of a ventriloquist actor as coming from the moving dummy. Here we used meta-contrast masking to render a brief flash stimulus non-conscious while participants performed a sound localization task. We found that, despite being at chance performance in discriminating the flash location, participants were nevertheless biased to localize sounds towards the unconscious flash locations. The effect was present in virtually all participants, was nearly as large as the effect on conscious trials, and was robust to controls for individual differences in task performance. Decoding analyses of concurrently recorded EEG signals showed that the non-conscious flash location information was present up until around 230ms but not after; confirming that the visual influence on sound perception likely occurred before conscious broadcast. Our findings suggest that subjective perception is not required for the integration of signals originating in distinct sensory modalities prompting new questions about the role of subjective perception in multisensory integration.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

How do two mechanically coupled partners with different individual vigors collaborate, e.g. to move a table together? Here, we show that such dyads coordinate goal-directed movements with minimal interaction force, exhibiting a dyadic vigor with similar characteristics as individual vigor. The emerging dyadic motor plan is strongly influenced by the slower partner, whose vigor predicts dyadic vigor, with effects lasting beyond connected practice. Computational modeling reveals the critical role of the partners' movement timing's uncertainty and vigor in shaping coordination, allowing to predict dyadic movements from individual behavior across diverse conditions.

Here, we generated knockin (KI) mice harboring the murine version of Tyr635Cys/Glu756Gln MDGA1 (Mdga1Y636C/E751Q) and performed extensive behavioral analyses. Male KI mouse pups and adults exhibited impaired ultrasonic vocalizations and sensorimotor gating (ASD-relevant behavioral deficits), and thus exhibited phenotypes different from those of male Mdga1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice.

AAV-based approaches have several advantages over transgenic mouse lines, including ease of application to many different animal models without extensive crossing and their amenability to intersectional approaches. Here, we provide an in-depth characterization of retinal ganglion cell types labeled by two AAV vectors drawn from a recent panel of constructs with synthetic promoters. Each promoter analyzed here was derived from a gene expressed in a cell type specific manner. Using a combination of morphology, molecular markers, and electrophysiological measurement of light responses, we found that each vector labeled distinct subsets of RGCs. However, both labeled more cell types than expected from the expression pattern of the promoters endogenous gene. We then characterized the projection patterns of these RGC types to the brain, finding that each AAV type labeled distinct axonal populations.

Despite the growing interest in diffusion-exchange studies of complex systems--where at least one exchanging component exhibits non-Gaussian diffusion--comparative studies remain scarce. Most existing investigations have applied different diffusion MR methods to different biological samples under varying experimental conditions, making direct comparisons difficult. Moreover, the lack of a gold standard for exchange rate measurements further complicates efforts to validate and interpret results. To address these challenges, we employed two diffusion NMR-based methods--the constant-gradient pulsed field gradient (CG-PFG) and the recently introduced filter-exchange NMR spectroscopy (FEXSY)--to investigate apparent water exchange in yeast cells and optic nerves, both before and after fixation. We first evaluated the effect of the q-values on the extracted indices and then evaluated the stability and reproducibility of the measurements. The CG-PFG and FEXSY experiments were collected on the same sample to allow for comparison of the results. The intracellular mean residence times (MRTs) ({tau}i) extracted from the log-linear fit of the CG-PFG NMR experiments were found to be 554{+/-}6ms and 337{+/-}10ms for yeast cells before and after fixation, respectively. The respective {tau}i values extracted from the FEXSY experiments before and after fixation were found to be 368{+/-}14ms and 146{+/-}24ms, respectively. Despite the difference in absolute values of the MRTs, the same qualitative behavior is observed in the two methodologies, and both could be analyzed using the bi-compartmental Karger model. The same methodologies were then used to study exchange in the more complex porcine optic nerves. There, the bi-compartmental Karger model analysis is shown to be inadequate. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are used to narrow down on the most possible explanation, suggesting that optic nerves are multi-compartmental systems where not all spins are free to undergo exchange. Supporting theoretical calculation point to the existence of at least one additional non-exchanging restricted compartment. Thus, a tri-compartmental model is derived and used to analyze the data. The new model fits the data significantly better and results in dramatically different exchange rates when used on white matter (WM) data: CG-PFG experiments were found to be 730{+/-}40ms and 803{+/-}16ms for optic nerve before and after fixation, respectively. The respective {tau}i values extracted from the FEXSY experiments before and after fixation were found to be 530{+/-}125ms and 387{+/-}104ms, respectively. These values are considerably smaller than values that were previously reported. Finally, we use simulations to show that the quantitative discrepancy between the CG-PFG and FEXSY can be attributed, at least partially, to the difference in T2 values between the intra- and extracellular compartments. We thus encourage the pairing of exchange and spin-spin relaxation measurements in future works. We end with a discussion on the current state of the diffusion-exchange, and in an attempt to put a spotlight on essential corner stones that are still missing despite the great advance of recent years -- experimental standardization, method comparison and adequate modeling.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we describe that -FGFR3-positive patients consistently report neuropathic pain and display a distinct clinical phenotype characterized by large-fiber involvement and non-length-dependent fiber loss, suggesting dorsal root ganglia (DRG) dysfunction. We demonstrate that -FGFR3 bind to sensory neurons within dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We validated both at the transcript and protein level that the target of autoantibodies, FGFR3, is expressed in human sensory neurons and that therefore -FGFR3 could find their target in primary afferents. DRG neurons exposed to -FGFR3 rapidly acquired a hyperexcitability phenotype. Injection of -FGFR3-positive patient serum in rats caused mechanical hypersensitivity, mirroring patient-reported pain symptoms. Mechanistically, -FGFR3 activated the Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling cascade, specifically extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38, which are known to enhance neuronal excitability. Epitope mapping revealed key extracellular epitopes on FGFR3. Blocking these epitopes prevented -FGFR3-induced sensory neuron hyperexcitability, thus showing that the autoantibody binding of the FGFR3 extracellular domain is a key factor affecting DRG neurons. Our work suggests that beyond their role as biomarkers, -FGFR3 actively contribute to pain hypersensitivity by acting on the DRG.

We propose a novel approach that leverages neuronal avalanches, spatiotemporal cascades of brain activity, as biomarkers to characterize and predict user-specific learning mechanism. Using electroencephalography (EEG) data collected across four MI-BCI training sessions in 20 healthy participants, we extracted two features: avalanche length and activations. These features revealed significant training and task-condition effects, particularly in later sessions. Crucially, changes in these features across sessions (avalanche length and activations) correlated significantly with BCI performance and enabled prediction of future BCI success via longitudinal Support Vector Regression and Classification models. Predictive accuracy reached up to 91%, with notable improvements after spatial filtering based on selected regions of interest.

While most studies focus on the genetic basis of CHDs, relatively little is known about the interplay between intrinsic signaling and external environmental factors in the progression of CHDs after birth during the perinatal circulatory transition window when environmental stress factors are prevalent. We recently explored such interplay through a newly identified gene-environment regulatory circuit involving Wnt11 signaling and systemic hypoxia. Specifically, we demonstrated that activation of the Wnt11/Rb1 axis is critical for normal chamber-specific development after birth. This regulatory switch is disrupted by systemic hypoxia more robustly in the right ventricle (RV) than the left ventricle (LV), leading to enhanced neonatal cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in an RV-specific manner, resulting in delayed maturation and attenuation of ventricular patterning in response to systemic hypoxia stress in the neonatal heart. Furthermore, we found that the Wnt11/Rb1 axis is also inactivated in infantile hearts with cyanotic CHDs, such as tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), potentially contributing to hypoxia-associated RV abnormalities in this context. However, the molecular players of this signaling cascade in neonatal cardiomyocyte remain largely unknown. Herein, we report that Frizzled 4 (Fzd4) acts as a specific upstream receptor for Wnt11 in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Specifically, Fzd4 exhibited an expression pattern like Wnt11 in neonatal heart perinatal circulatory transition under normal and hypoxemic environments. Furthermore, Fzd4 loss in neonatal cardiomyocytes stimulated cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity and disrupted the Wnt11-Rb1 signaling axis mirroring the impact of the Wnt11-deficient cardiomyocyte phenotype. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the Wnt11-Fzd4 binding in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes and intact hearts. These results demonstrate that Fzd4 is a specific and required upstream receptor for the Wnt11-Rb1 signaling activity in the neonatal heart and provides mechanistic insights into the essential role of Wnt11 as a key positive regulator of neonatal cardiomyocyte transition from proliferative to mature phenotype at the interphase of life.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that spontaneous calcium waves arise among non-neuronal support cells in the developing Drosophila eye to drive retinal morphogenesis. Waves are initiated by Cad96Ca receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, triggering PLCgamma-mediated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. A cell-type-specific Innexin-code coordinates wave propagation through a defined gap junction network among non-neuronal retinal cells, excluding photoreceptors. Wave intensity scales with ommatidial size, triggering stronger Myosin II-driven apical contractions at interommatidial boundaries in larger ommatidia. This size-dependent mechanism compensates for early boundary irregularities, ensuring uniform ommatidial packing critical for precise optical architecture.

As PD has no significant cure or treatments to this day, early diagnosis, or detections of PD within potential patients is a crucial task to maximize the effect of mediations which are implemented to achieve temporal prohibition of motor failure progression. In recent research, alongside conventional diagnosis methods based on neurological examinations or MRI based brain imaging, use of deep learning based artificial intelligence models, such as CNN, are repeatedly reported to have significant progress in detecting PD in early stages with high performance. Based on current success, this research attempted to further enhance AI-driven PD diagnosis by developing a deep learning based causal representation learning framework that extracts only highly robust PD features from simple hand drawings. Specifically, convolutional VAE based reconstruction and information theory based weakly supervised learning were linked with causal representation learning methods to distinguish significant PD features from geometrical features within hand drawing images.

In contrast, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) accumulate in high numbers in inflammatory tissues via the interaction between CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expressed on MSC and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) secreted during inflammation. Therefore, this study investigated coating gelatin nanospheres (GNS) with MSC membranes (MSC-GNS) by extrusion and ultrasonication methods to enhance their inflammatory tissue tropism. {zeta}-potential measurements, western blotting and single-particle analysis of MSC-GNS by flow cytometry demonstrated the GNS surface was successfully coated with MSC membranes.

The blood clearance of MSC-GNS was examined by their intravenous injection into mice. Although MSC-GNS and GNS were retained during the early distribution phase, MSC-GNS had a higher retention than GNS during the later elimination phase. Finally, we investigated the tissue distribution of MSC-GNS by intravenous injection into a mouse model of liver fibrosis and their potential therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis. We found a higher accumulation of MSC-GNS in inflamed livers and higher blood retention compared with MSC-membrane-free GNS. Furthermore, MSC-GNS loaded with an anti-fibrotic agent (LSKL, a 4-amino acid peptide that inhibits fibrosis progression) had an enhanced therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis than uncoated nanoparticles.

Yet, probing their functional state at the single-organelle level without invasive labels remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce a novel, label-free approach that leverages Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) beyond its traditional imaging role, transforming it into a powerful tool for functional analysis of individual, isolated mitochondria. By immobilizing mouse liver mitochondria on polylysine-coated mica, we achieved nanoscale resolution of mitochondrial mechanical properties including height, height fluctuation power spectra, and Young's modulus, under different respiratory states. Strikingly, fluctuations in mitochondrial height fluctuations below 20 Hz showed robust correlation with the mitochondria membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}), a cornerstone of mitochondrial function. This relationship allows AFM to sensitively detect changes in the mitochondria bioenergetic status. Applying this method to mitochondria from liver-specific MTCH2 liver-conditional knockout mice, a model of mitochondrial malfunction, we confirmed AFM's diagnostic potential. The technique reliably distinguished malfunctional mitochondria, mirroring and adding new insights beyond conventional fluorescence assays. By bridging nanomechanics and mitochondrial bioenergetics, this approach paves the way for non-invasive, high-resolution diagnostics at the single-organelle level, holding promise to monitor the actual functional state of mitochondria in clinical settings.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "T cells can recognize a few molecules of cognate antigen amongst vastly outnumbering non-cognate ligands. The T cell receptor (TCR) differentiates antigens based on antigen-TCR binding dwell time through a kinetic proofreading process. Historically, this has been modeled as the ligated receptor undergoing a series of reactions before producing a signal. In such a sequential mechanism, the number of steps is a key determinant of discrimination fidelity. Here, we consider two features of the molecular mechanism of TCR activation that diverge from a sequential process and suggest that an alternative kinetic proofreading mechanism may be at play. First, activation processes of multiple ITAM domains of the TCR represent parallel reaction sequences taking place on a single TCR molecule. Second, the states of the parallel proofreading reactions are integrated to produce a binary output from each TCR in the form of a discrete LAT condensation event, which may or may not occur. We examine a revised kinetic proofreading scheme based on parallel reactions followed by an integration step (multi-thread scheme) and compare its performance with the sequential scheme in a stochastic setting. A distinct difference in a multi-thread scheme is that multiplicity of the parallel reaction threads provides an additional means to increase discrimination fidelity. This relieves the need for fine-tuned kinetics among chemically distinct reaction steps, which is a major hurdle for physical implementation of a sequential mechanism. Lastly, we reinterpret previously reported experimental observations and find that various proofreading behaviors are well described as proofreading through parallel reaction threads.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

HMGA1 expression, readily detectable by immunohistochemistry, progressively increases from chronic MPN phases to sAML, outperforming established markers (CD34/CD117) in predicting impending leukemic transformation (AUC = 0.96). Mechanistically, HMGA1 cooperates with JAK2V617F and TP53 mutations to promote leukemogenesis. Clinically, high HMGA1 levels correlate with resistance to first-generation JAK inhibitors and portend poor overall survival. Importantly, the next generation JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor pacritinib abrogates HMGA1-driven proliferation and significantly extends survival in preclinical models, offering an immediate therapeutic strategy for this high-risk population.

Challenges to diagnosis and treatment include a lack of effective screening methods for early detection, the absence of cancer-specific symptoms, and the development of chemoresistance. The genomic instability of HGSOC, further complicated by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), leads to heterogeneity in HGSOC tumors and patient response to treatment. This makes it challenging to develop a single, effective diagnostic and treatment approach for this disease. Proteogenomic studies have provided some insight into HGSOC biology, but a deeper understanding of the tumor proteome through chemotherapy and disease recurrence is needed. Here we have profiled the proteome of tumors from 29 HGSOC patients before and after multiple rounds of chemotherapy. The proteome of HGSOC tumors remained unchanged for individual patients even after numerous rounds of chemotherapy. Differential expression analysis revealed known and novel proteins associated with chemoresistance and HRD status, further supported by similar changes at the genetic and epigenetic levels. We found that HRD affected proteins related to immune pathways. HRD was also associated with more shared T cell receptor (TCR) CDR3 repertoires of tumor-infiltrating T cells and increased neoantigen counts. ERAP1, a protein involved in peptide trimming before antigen presentation to immune cells via MHC- class I, was overexpressed in homologous recombination proficient (HRP) tumors and negatively correlated to neoantigen count. Its potential role in immune suppression in HRP tumors makes it an attractive therapeutic target that may be effective in combination with immunotherapy, particularly for HRP tumors. 26-plex immunostaining of HGSOC whole tissues further revealed significant differences in the spatial proximities of immune cells to each other and to tumor cells based on HRD status.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the changes in gene expression associated with domestication. We performed a meta-analysis of public gene expression data of domesticated species of rice, tomato, and soybean and their presumed ancestral species. In wild relatives, the expression of genes involved in osmotic, drought, and wound stress tolerance was upregulated.

These nonassociative consequences of stress, referred to as fear sensitization, are thought to underlie some symptoms of trauma-related disorders. Fear sensitization has been predominately studied using the Stress-Enhanced Fear Learning (SEFL) paradigm, which models the stress-induced amplification of fear learning. Less is known about the mechanisms through which unlearned fear responses are sensitized by stress. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms for sensitization of unlearned fear responses using a paradigm we termed Stress-Enhanced Fear Responding (SEFR). In this model, mice exposed to a single session of footshock stress exhibit enhanced freezing to a novel tone stimulus. To investigate brain regions that might mediate SEFR, we first used c-Fos mapping to identify neural activity changes associated with stress-induced enhancement of unlearned fear. Our c-Fos screen identified the posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) as a region that was persistently hyperactive after footshock stress and whose activity correlated with behavioral expression of SEFR. Using fiber photometry, we observed that SEFR, but not SEFL, was associated with increased activity in the pPVT. Next, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of the pPVT blocked both the induction of SEFR during stress and its later expression, while artificial stimulation of pPVT in stress-naive mice was sufficient to recapitulate SEFR. Interestingly, pPVT inhibition or stimulation did not affect acquisition or expression of SEFL. In conclusion, our results indicate that sensitization of fear learning (SEFL) and sensitization of unlearned fear (SEFR) have distinct neural mechanisms. Our results identify pPVT hyperactivity as a mechanism for stress-induced sensitization of unlearned fear and highlight pPVT as a potential target for treating arousal and reactivity symptoms of trauma- and stressor-related disorders.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Pupillometry research lacks a robust, standardized framework for data preprocessing, whereas in functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography, researchers have converged on tools such as fMRIPrep, EEGLAB and MNE-Python; these tools are considered the gold standard in the field. Many established pupillometry preprocessing packages and workflows fall short of serving the goal of enhancing reproducibility, especially since most existing solutions lack designs based on Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. To promote FAIR and open science practices for pupillometry research, we developed eyeris, a complete pupillometry preprocessing suite designed to be intuitive, modular, performant, and extensible (https://github.com/shawntz/eyeris). Out-of-the-box, eyeris provides a recommended preprocessing workflow and considers signal processing best practices for tonic and phasic pupillometry. Moreover, eyeris further enables open and reproducible science workflows, as well as quality control workflows by following a well-established file management schema and generating interactive output reports for both record keeping/sharing and quality assurance of preprocessed pupil data prior to formal analysis. Taken together, eyeris provides a robust all-in-one transparent and adaptive solution for high-fidelity pupillometry preprocessing with the aim of further improving reproducibility in pupillometry research.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has severe adverse health and economic impacts totaling over $240 billion annually. Despite this, FDA approved treatments for AUD are limited. For this reason, further understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms in AUD is required for new treatments. An aspect of AUD involves deficits in behavioral flexibility that is similarly seen in animal models with depletion of dorsal striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs). We found that acute EtOH (40 mM) inhibits the firing rate of dorsal striatal CINs, which are the primary source of acetylcholine (ACh) in the dorsal striatum. Additionally, we found through slice photometry recordings using an intensity-based ACh sensing fluorescent reporter (iAChSnFR) that acute EtOH (40 mM) inhibits dorsal striatal ACh release. In accord, in vivo fiber photometry with iAChSnFR also showed inhibition of ACh release following acute EtOH (2 g/kg ip). To induce EtOH dependence in mice, we used the chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) vapor exposure model. Following CIE, we found that CIE-treated mice had a significant depression of ACh release compared to control mice in the dorsomedial but not dorsolateral striatum. Then, we performed stereological cell counts of CINs in CIE and control mice to examine the cause of this ACh deficit and found that CIE mice had a significant decrease in CINs in the dorsomedial but not dorsolateral striatum. In conclusion, our data show that EtOH inhibits dorsal striatal cholinergic signaling in a subregion specific manner that may contribute to AUD related behaviors.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

This membrane fusion process is significantly influenced by factors such as host cell membrane lipid composition, membrane architecture, and cell surface receptors. However, the specific mechanisms by which dengue virus membrane fusion is modulated by the cell membrane lipids are not fully elucidated. We investigate the role of oxidised cholesterol metabolite, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) in inhibiting dengue virus infection using virus fusion and viral infection assays. We demonstrate that 25-HC significantly impedes the membrane fusion capability of the dengue virus, thereby inhibiting viral entry and infection in cell cultures. Apart from inhibiting membrane fusion, pre-exposure to 25-HC upregulates CH25H which inhibits virus growth. Indeed, CH25H gene is upregulated along with other ISGs in various cell types as a defence response to dengue virus infection. These insights into the modulation of dengue virus membrane fusion by lipid cofactors in the host cell membrane present a promising avenue for the development of strategies aimed at inhibiting viral membrane fusion, thereby potentially curtailing the spread of the infection. For example, we show that other inhibitors that target mechanisms distinct from 25-HC action on membrane fusion display strong positive synergy in virus inhibition with 25-HC.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Non-crop plants surrounding large plantings of agricultural crops can provide numerous ecological services to adjacent agricultural plants but have rarely been considered as a source of microorganisms during the early stages of their growth. In this study we test whether agricultural plants in close proximity to surrounding woodland habitat fragments develop a denser microbiome than plants farther away, and whether the composition of the crop microbiomes more closely resembles the composition of the surrounding vegetation when in close proximity. During the early stages of development, we sampled epiphytic bacteria from corn and soybean leaves over 4 and 3 weekly sampling timepoints, respectively, using a spatially explicit design, and on the final timepoint for both host species we additionally sampled a younger cohort of leaves. To contextualize the source strength of the surrounding vegetation we also sampled the soil at each sampling location. Both crop species exhibited a microbiome density gradient and a decay of microbiome similarity to surrounding vegetation over a distance of 100 m from the field edges at many timepoints. Phyllosphere microbiome similarity to the soil also tended to increase into the field interior. The strength of host plant microbiome filtering also depended on the proximity to the surrounding vegetation, with intermediate to most distant locations exhibiting the highest values of host filtering, reflecting an apparent decrease in immigrant inoculum. The bacterial communities of younger leaves tended to more closely resemble those of the older surrounding conspecific leaves than either the soil or surrounding woodland vegetation, reflecting the growing dominance of inoculum from within developing crop canopies as plants grew. Overall, our study sheds light on the important role that dispersal of bacteria from nearby leaves can play in phyllosphere microbiome assembly and highlights the diminishing role that soil plays in assembly of phyllosphere microbiomes as plant sources are closer or more abundant.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

However, some flowers combine colours associated with different pollinators, suggesting bimodal adaptation. The perennial herb Cyrtanthus obliquus produces red corollas with yellow tips and is pollinated by birds, but also by bees. To assess the role of the two pollinator categories in shaping selection on the bi-coloured corollas, we examined bee choices in arrays in which the colour signals of plants had been manipulated, and we quantified total as well as bird-mediated phenotypic selection on flower colour using both bird and bee visual models. Bees preferred flowers with a yellow signal over all-red flowers. The analysis of phenotypic selection indicated that both birds and bees influence net selection on flower colour, resulting in conflicting selection on the colour contrast between corolla and corolla tip. Our findings show that the optimal phenotype should depend on the relative importance of the two categories of pollinators in a given population, and are consistent with bimodal adaptation.

H.", "abstract": "Quantitative genetics methods can be particularly powerful in model organisms and non-human populations, and we now have strain collections such as recombinant inbred lines, etc. that can be phenotyped. Natural diversity is also valuable in non-model systems that do not yet have reverse genetic tools. However, purchasing and phenotyping large collections can be cost-prohibitive. Strain or sample acquisition costs may also vary dramatically for different strains or isolates. Thus, investigators need efficient strategies to optimize experimental power for a given limited budget. In this study, we evaluate several approaches to optimally select subsets of the total cohort to best maintain power when performing genome-wide association studies. Some approaches focus solely on costs, others on genetic diversity, and some on both simultaneously. Through simulation studies across different minor allele frequencies and SNP effect sizes, we demonstrate that selecting for cost is most beneficial at low-to-moderate budget thresholds, while selecting for diversity is optimal in scenarios involving rare (MAF 5-10%) variants or higher total costs, or when accounting for additional costs per strain studied. We also evaluate these approaches on data from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), and find that an approach that considers both cost and diversity is superior at recovering significant loci and maintaining statistical power under real-world conditions. This approach picks the strains that, for a given budget, minimize the total genetic distance to the strains that were not selected. This approach, which we term \"ThriftyMD\" (for \"Thrifty Minimum Distance\"), extends previous distance-based methods to pick a representative panel by explicitly adding a cost constraint. Overall, our results highlight the trade-offs between cost, diversity, and power in GWAS cohort design, and present the ThriftyMD algorithm as a versatile and robust approach for optimizing study design in resource-limited settings.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Current approaches targeting inflammation or implant material properties have failed clinically, but the mechanical origins of implant-induced fibrosis remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that directional imbalance of mechanical forces (tension anisotropy) is the primary driver of fibroblast activation at implant-tissue interfaces, and that it can be eliminated through adhesive bonding strategies. Computational modeling reveals a mechanistic basis for successful adhesive anti-fibrotic interfaces: conventional sutured implants generate highly anisotropic stress fields between discrete suture anchor points that activate fibroblasts, while adhesive interfaces distribute forces isotropically, maintaining a mechanical environment that does not activate fibroblasts. In vivo experiments from the literature across multiple animal models confirm these predictions: as predicted, adhesive interfaces completely prevent fibrotic capsule formation for up to 12 weeks across diverse organs, while maintaining identical implant composition and geometry compared to sutured controls. Results establish tension anisotropy as a mechanical regulator of implant fibrosis and provide a mechanistic foundation explaining why adhesive interfaces succeed where all previous anti-fibrotic strategies have failed. By addressing the root mechanical cause of fibrosis, this mechanobiology-driven approach may enable a universal approach for preventing fibrosis across all categories of implantable medical devices.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein persistence in the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in otherwise healthy individuals, a set of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and a case of a 60-year-old man who developed a new onset of lupus nephritis seven months following mild COVID-19 disease. We have identified that N protein persistence in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) did not correlate with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood but is associated with significantly increased secretion of type I interferons (IFN) and presence of tubuloreticular structures in peripheral leukocytes. We further demonstrate that the N protein colocalizes in the mitochondrial fraction of PBMCs from individuals positive for N protein alongside mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). In vitro expression of the N protein in a monocytic cell line showed that the N protein itself was directly capable of interacting with MAVS in the absence of viral RNA, and this interaction was enhanced if the cell was exposed to oxidative stress. We show that the type I IFN signature in the presence of N protein expression was MAVS, but not STING signaling pathway-dependent. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the onset and promotion of type I IFN signature after COVID-19; in our model, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein can independently trigger sustained type I IFN production via direct activation of MAVS and its spontaneous oligomerization.

Unlike other SERPINs, PAI-1 undergoes a relatively rapid rearrangement to a lower energy latent conformation. We employ deep mutational scanning (DMS) to simultaneously probe the effects of nearly all single amino acid substitutions (92%) in PAI-1 on its latency transition as well as its ability to inhibit its canonical protease target, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). The DMS results are interpreted in the context of variant effect predictors (EVE, AlphaMissense, and CPT) and protein stability predictors (EvoEF and FoldX), as well as the evolutionary conservation of the PAI-1 sequence space across extant vertebrate species. We demonstrate that while variant effect predictors can generally partition PAI-1 as functional or non-functional with respect to uPA inhibition, they perform poorly when attempting to discriminate the effects of PAI-1 variants on its latency transition. However, by employing protein stability predictors, we demonstrate that the PAI-1 latency transition is most likely driven by changes in the energy barrier to the latency transition. Finally, we show that PAI-1's ability to inhibit uPA, as well as its thermodynamic instability in its active conformation are both under purifying selection that limits the sequence space available to PAI-1. These findings suggest that DMS of collateral fitness effects, including PAI-1's latency transition, may be better interpreted in contexts other than variant effect predictors, including protein thermodynamics and evolution.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Determining changes to bone tissue metabolism with CKD may reveal insights important to monitoring and mitigating the decrease in bone fracture resistance that commonly occurs as a result of this disease. In this study, untargeted metabolomics was conducted on marrow-flushed cortical tibiae from female and male C57BL/6J mice fed either a control or 0.2% w/w adenine diet. The diets were continued over 3.5 or 7 weeks to produce different severities of kidney injury. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to assess metabolites from tibia extracts. Group comparisons (CKD vs control, 7 weeks vs 3.5 weeks, female vs male) were conducted using principal components analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and hierarchical clustering. Clusters of metabolites were also assessed using ensemble clustering and cluster optimization analysis (ECCO). Volcano plots and VIP scores were used to identify individual metabolites that differed between groups. Pathway analyses were then conducted from these metabolites. The CKD mice, compared with control mice, had dysregulated essential and nonessential amino acid pathways along with altered pathways associated with sugar and fatty acid metabolism. Compared with mice fed an adenine diet for 3.5 weeks, the mice fed an adenine diet over 7 weeks showed dysregulations in the pentose phosphate pathway along with essential and nonessential amino acid metabolism, porphyrin metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and other pathways relevant to energy production. Sex differences were apparent in the bone tissue metabolomes of females and males. Compared to males, females experienced dysregulations in essential and nonessential amino acid pathways along with other pathways associated with energy derivation, such as pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis.

Mini-CR1 acts a potent cofactor for factor I driven proteolysis of C3b leading to iC3b and then C3dg formation, iC3b itself remains a potent opsonin. As well as inhibiting the alternative complement pathway, mini-CR1 acts as a cofactor for C4b degradation thereby inhibiting the classical pathway.

One of the main factors related to its development is poor nutrition and micronutrient deficiency in the diet. Essential metals, especially divalent ions as zinc, play crucial roles in the neurobiology of the nervous system, including pain signaling and transmission mechanisms, and metabolism control. The present study aimed to understand the impact of zinc in neuropathic pain, evaluating whether restriction and direct repletion of a dietary zinc could change nociceptive behavior and metabolic parameters in adult mice. Methods: Adult male Swiss mice received a zinc-restricted diet for eight weeks. The repletion group received the restricted diet for four weeks followed by normal zinc diet for another four weeks. Mechanical and heat thermal pain sensitivity were assessed using the von Frey filaments and Hargreaves tests, respectively. Results: Zinc restriction resulted in decreased body weight gain and led to an increased mechanical and thermal sensitivity to heat. Dietary zinc repletion reversed the thermal allodynia and increased weight gain, abdominal adipose tissue, and liver weight compared to a normal zinc diet. No changes were observed concerning food and water intake, glycemic profile, pancreatic morphology and plasma amylin.

Sitagliptin, an antidiabetic drug that carries a trifluoromethyl group, which is a precursor of the persistent trifluoroacetic acid, is excreted largely unmetabolized and inefficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants, leading to its widespread detection in surface waters. The hyporheic zone - a region between surface water and groundwater - serves as a natural bioreactor with high microbial activity and diverse redox conditions, offering the potential for sitagliptin attenuation. This study explored the biotransformation of sitagliptin in hyporheic sediments under varying redox conditions through batch experiments and field observations. Furthermore, we showed that batch experiments can complement field observations to capture both mechanistic insights and their environmental relevance. Batch experiments revealed amide hydrolysis and N-acetylation of sitagliptin under anoxic conditions, with subsequent deamination and oxidation of transformation products under oxic conditions. Metagenome-resolved metaproteomics suggested Pseudomonas asiatica as a key player in the oxic transformation. Field analysis of pore water samples identified up to 6.47 g L-1 sitagliptin and ten transformation products with concentrations of up to 4.82 g L-1. Amide hydrolysis products were the most abundant transformation products and preferentially formed under anoxic conditions. All investigated transformation products exhibited lower cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response than sitagliptin in in vitro bioassays, highlighting the detoxification potential of the hyporheic zone.

AlphaFold has emerged as a promising tool for protein structure prediction, though its utility in modeling single amino acid substitutions remains uncertain. In this study, we assessed AlphaFold 3's accuracy in modeling natural variants of the Helicobacter pylori catalase KatA by comparing its predictions to a novel high-resolution crystal structure of KatA from strain SS1. This variant contains key substitutions at residues 234, 237, 255, and 421 relative to the well-characterized strain 26695. AlphaFold 3 models accurately reproduced the global structure and local conformations of most variant residues, with high fidelity in conservative substitutions but variable accuracy in more flexible or interface-exposed sites.

While AlphaFold 3 consistently produced high-quality models, deviations at variant sites occurred when incorrect oligomeric states were specified. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of AlphaFold 3 in modeling natural protein variants and underscore the importance of accurate user input for reliable structural predictions.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

N.; Geddes-McAlister, J.; Nielsen, K.", "abstract": "To predict the outcomes of disseminated fungal disease, a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the site of infection is needed to identify targets for clinical intervention and diagnostic development. Cryptococcus neoformans is the causative agent of cryptococcosis, the largest infectious killer of individuals living with HIV. Cryptococcal infection begins in the lungs, with loss of immunological control leading to disseminated central nervous system disease and death. Using advanced mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques, in vivo infection models, and patient-derived clinical strains, we explored the proteomic profiles of C. neoformans infections related to differences in strain virulence. Our findings reveal that non-lethal latent infection produces a proteomic response that differs significantly from the response caused by lethal infections, and that the proteomic profiles of typical and hypervirulent infections are markedly similar despite differences in time-to-death. Overall, the mouse pulmonary proteomic response in latent infection is defined by enrichment of proteins and pathways involved in extracellular matrix organization, cell adhesion, and structural changes, while the lethal infection is dominated by host-defense, translation, and metabolic processes. These results provide clinically relevant information on how infections caused by different Cryptococcus strains may produce significantly different outcomes. We also identified abundant fungal proteins that could be future drug targets in latent and lethal cryptococcal infection.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

One key mechanism of virus-host sensing is host-mediated post-translational modifications of viral proteins. While viral protein phosphorylation by host kinases is known to modulate viral functions, the global prevalence of kinase motifs across diverse viruses, and the signaling pathways they reflect, remains to be systematically explored. Here, we annotated human kinase motifs in 1,505 viral proteomes and uncovered enriched motifs in viral proteins that diverged from patterns observed in human proteins. Integration of our findings with 21,606 viral protein structures and deep mass spectrometry phosphoproteomics of infected human cells revealed that surface-accessible residues were preferentially phosphorylated and exhibited greater kinase specificity compared to buried sites. Virus-enriched motifs mapped predominantly to stress, inflammation, and cell cycle pathways--key signaling hubs dysregulated during infection that are central to the virus-host arms race--most strikingly for Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Herpesviridae, and Retroviridae families. Temporal phosphoproteomic profiling of host kinase activity during alphavirus infection revealed dynamic patterns of stress kinase activation and viral protein phosphorylation, and the inhibition of MAP kinases reduced viral replication and phosphorylation at viral motifs with specificity for ERK and JNK kinases. Our findings suggest that viruses have evolved as biosensors of the host signaling state to optimize their life cycles, revealing new antiviral opportunities aimed at disrupting virus decision-making by manipulating host signaling cues.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Treatment is typically empirical, as in vitro antimicrobial activity has not been evaluated, and therapeutic efficacy remains unclear. This study aimed to assess in vitro susceptibility and identify genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence in M. cynos and M. felis clinical isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for doxycycline, tetracycline, minocycline, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and azithromycin were determined using a broth microdilution assay developed for this study. Hybrid genomes were generated using Oxford Nanopore and Illumina sequencing. AMR-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gyrA gene correlated with high MICs to enrofloxacin and marbofloxacin in both species. Mutations in 23S rRNA were associated with reduced susceptibility to azithromycin. In M. felis, novel variants in gyrA and the 50S ribosomal protein L4 were linked to decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and azithromycin, respectively. The data also suggest potential intrinsic resistance to azithromycin in M. felis. All isolates required low MICs of tetracyclines, and resistance mutations were not identified in the 16S rRNA gene, supporting tetracyclines as effective first-line treatment options. Virulence genes, particularly those associated with adhesion and immune evasion, were detected in both M. cynos and M. felis. This study presents the first comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of AMR and virulence in M. cynos and M. felis, providing new insights into their pathogenicity and informing evidence-based therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

This contrasts with the human host's preference for AG-ending codons, suggesting that ZIKV may exploit specific tRNA modifications to optimize protein synthesis within human cells. To test this hypothesis, we used codon-biased eGFP sensors and found that ZIKV infection transiently increased the expression of AA-biased GFP at the expense of AG-biased GFP. Mass spectrometry analysis further showed that ZIKV virus infection increases mcm5s2U34 tRNA modification content in host cells. In ELP1-deficient cells, which exhibit reduced U34 modifications, ZIKV replication was impaired. Enhancing U34 modification through using a small molecule known to restore ELP1 expression, rescued viral replication in these cells. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9 and shRNA-mediated knockdown of key enzymes involved in U34 modification, ELP1, ALKBH8, and CTU1, significantly reduced ZIKV replication. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that ZIKV reprograms the host tRNA epitranscriptome and exploits host cell tRNA modifications, particularly at the wobble position U34, to optimize translation of its own proteins and promote viral replication.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we analyzed the effect of D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on primary CD4 T cells that were latently infected with HIV. We found that THC had no detectable effect on baseline or latency reversing agent (LRA) stimulated HIV expression, or on expression of an activation marker (CD38). However, using an integrated multiomic single-cell analysis of genome-wide chromatin accessibility and gene expression, we observed altered expression of several hundred genes in HIV infected CD4 T cells after THC exposure, including transcriptional downregulation of genes involved in protein translation and antiviral pathways, indicating that THC suppresses innate immune activation in infected cells. Additionally, chromatin accessibility analysis demonstrated upregulated chromatin binding activity for the transcriptional regulator CTCF, and reduced activity for members of the ETS transcription factor family in infected cells after THC exposure. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which cannabis use could influence the persistence of HIV within cellular reservoirs and the molecular phenotype of latently infected cells.

In this study, RETtdTomato and GATA3mCherry reporter lines were used to further investigate this plasticity.

Subsequent addition of RSPO1 induced patterning of distalizsed nephrons, including distal convoluted tubule and thick ascending limb of loop of Henle but lacking proximal segments or glomeruli. This epithelium showed a capacity to adopt ureteric epithelial or nephric duct-like states in ex vivo co-culture in response to external cues.

Sex promotes genetic diversity and facilitates natural selection, and in eukaryotes such as unicellular fungi, sexual reproduction leads to hyphal growth and spore production, enabling escape from harsh environments and long-distance dispersal. The human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus species complex (encompassing C. neoformans, C. deneoformans, and the C. gattii sub-complexes) exhibit diversity in sexual reproduction, including -a mating, pseudosexual reproduction, as well as unisexual reproduction initiated from a single isolate or between isolates of the same mating type. A central conundrum is that while most Cryptococcus natural populations exhibit significant  mating type bias, genetic and genomic analyses show recombination occurs in nature. The discovery of unisexual reproduction in C. deneoformans provided insight; however, thus far unisexual reproduction has never been observed in the predominant global pathogenic species C. neoformans. Here, we provide evidence that mutating the RIC8 gene, which encodes a conserved guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in activation of G proteins, enables unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans. Additionally, we show that genetic variation in the natural population promotes unisexual reproduction, and unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans shares similarities with that in C. deneoformans and involves canonical meiotic recombination. Finally, our data suggest that Ric8 interacts with Gpa1 and Gpa2 during -a mating, but the localization of these G proteins is not influenced by Ric8 during unisexual reproduction. This suggests differential regulation of the G proteins, likely involving the Ric8 protein, could underly switch between different modes of sexual reproduction in Cryptococcus. Our study further highlights that the highly conserved Ric8 GEF can act as an important regulator of cellular development in response to environmental stimuli and modulates sexual reproduction in nature. We hypothesize that unisexual reproduction occurs much more frequently in nature than currently appreciated, and possibly in other fungal species as well.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Central to their energy metabolism is a membrane [ndash]bound, sodium-translocating methyltransferase complex: the Na+ tetrahydromethanopterin:CoM-S [ndash]methyltransferase (Mtr complex), which catalyzes the methyl transfer between two methanogen specific cofactors. This exergonic methyl transfer step is coupled with a vectorial sodium ion transport from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior and is the only energy conserving step in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Here, we present a 2.1 [A] single-particle cryo-EM structure of the full Mtr complex from Methanosarcina mazei.

Most strikingly, we discover and characterize MtrI, a previously unannotated small open reading frame (small ORF), encoded protein (<100 aa) conserved across the order of Methanosarcinales. MtrI binds to the cytoplasmic domain of MtrA in response to oxygen exposure, suggesting a role in oxygen stress response and protection. By binding on top of the sodium channel and anchoring to the cobalamid cofactor in MtrA's cytoplasmic domain, MtrI might prevent sodium leakage and inhibit MtrA-CoM turnover.

Currently, the most widely used method for sample thinning involves focused ion or plasma beam milling of biological specimens to produce lamellae with thicknesses as low as 100-150 nm. However, surface damage caused by the milling process can extend 30-60 nm deep, leaving only a narrow undamaged core and thereby restricting the usable lamella thickness. This imposes significant limitations on single-particle analysis of smaller macromolecular complexes due to elevated structural noise, which cannot be avoided in situ because of the dense cellular environment composed of proteins, membranes, and other ultrastructures. Therefore, alternative methods capable of producing thinner samples are needed to reduce this structural background and enable in situ single-particle analysis. Here, we demonstrate that high-resolution structures at side-chain level can be obtained from vitreous sections prepared by cryo-ultramicrotomy, both in vitro and in situ. We optimized the method to produce high-quality sections as thin as 30-50 nm, free from significant surface damage such as crevasses. Using this approach, we determined the structure of the 50S ribosomal subunit in vitro in a standard buffer system and show that orientation bias can be overcome in using this technique. In addition, we systematically analyzed section thickness and show that our ultrathin sections are thin enough to physically cleave 70S ribosomes, suggesting that this approach may be particularly well suited for the structural analysis of smaller macromolecules.

Our results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 drives a remarkably consistent pattern of metabolic re-wiring at both the lipidomic and proteomic levels across all three variants. We mapped changes in the expression of host metabolic enzymes and compared these to corresponding shifts in lipid abundance. This integrative analysis identified key host proteins involved in virus-mediated lipid remodeling, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), and ORM1-like protein 2 (ORMDL2). Together, these findings highlight conserved metabolic dependencies of SARS-CoV-2 variants and underscore host lipid metabolism as a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

If left untreated, SMA patients have a poor prognosis, marked by the degeneration of motor neurons, progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. The approval of SMN-restoring therapies that improve symptoms and lifespan in patients with SMA has created emerging, non-neuronal phenotypes and an urgent need for deepening our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the knowledge that SMN loss drives alterations in translation, we used multiple tissues from a mouse model of SMA to uncover early translational alterations in key mRNAs and proteins, which act as contributors to pathogenesis and hallmarks of the disease. Among hundreds of differentially translated mRNAs, Col1a1 emerged as a translation-specific manifestation of early defects in the mouse model. These findings were confirmed in fibroblasts derived from patients with varying levels of disease severity. Notably, treatment with SMN-restoring therapies rescued COL1A1 protein levels, particularly in fibroblasts from patients with the most severe forms of the disease. Overall, our study identifies COL1A1 as an indicator of disease severity in SMA, which captures early molecular alterations and respond to SMN-modifying therapies.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate here that ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of Kras (KrasG12D) exclusively in pancreatic endocrine cells suppresses {beta}-cell proliferation, resulting in a dramatic reduction in {beta}-cell numbers and islet size. Conversely, we demonstrate that the potent and selective SOS1-RAS interaction inhibitor BI-3406 promotes unprecedented levels of {beta}-cell proliferation in primary human islets, both in culture and following transplantation in immunocompromised diabetic mice. Importantly, using murine models of streptozotocin-induced diabetes, we show that BI-3406 treatment restores {beta}-cell mass, leading to a gradual normalization of blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as to sustainable improvement in glucose tolerance.

While auditory deficits can be compensated by cochlea implants and hearing aids, no treatment exists to prevent retinal degeneration. Here, we generated retinal organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells of two USH1C patients to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving ocular pathogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing of both healthy and USH1C retinal organoids identified differential expression of genes related to phototransduction in photoreceptors, as well as alterations in cell adhesion and canonical Wnt signaling in Mueller glia cells. Analysis of intercellular communication revealed an overall reduced signaling efficiency, particularly affecting Mueller glia-mediated retinal adhesion processes. Morphological characterization of organoids confirmed transcriptome changes by showing degeneration of the outer limiting membrane and loss of adherens junction architecture. Moreover, photoreceptors revealed increased susceptibility to morphological and functional changes related to phototransduction. These results demonstrate that disruption of Mueller glia signaling contributes to a loss of retinal integrity, providing novel insights into USH1C pathogenesis and offering targets for therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

To identify mechanisms of higher order genome organization, we performed high-throughput imaging-based CRISPR knockout screens targeting 1064 genes encoding nuclear proteins in human cell lines. We assessed changes in the distribution of centromeres at single cell resolution as surrogate markers for global genome organization. The screens revealed multiple major regulators of spatial distribution of centromeres including components of the nucleolus, kinetochore, cohesins, condensins, and the nuclear pore complex. Alterations in centromere distribution required progression through the cell cycle and acute depletion of mitotic factors with distinct functions altered centromere distribution in the subsequent interphase. These results identify molecular determinants of spatial centromere organization, and they show that orderly progression through mitosis shapes interphase genome architecture.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Proximity labeling tools have been instrumental in identifying upstream or downstream effectors of specific proteins within signaling pathways. However, currently, there are no tools available to directly label and capture intermediary proteins that bridge two non-interacting proteins. Here, we developed STUPPIT (Split-TurboID and PUP-IT based Protein Identification Tool), a novel method combining split-TurboID and PUP-IT to biotinylate intermediary proteins of two non-interacting proteins through a two-step enzymatic reaction. Two approaches of STUPPIT were validated using three well-characterized protein triad, including YAP1/AMOT/{beta}-actin, YAP1/LATS1/MOB1A, and {beta}-catenin/-catenin/{beta}-actin. Combining STUPPIT and proteomics, we identified novel intermediary proteins including RNF20, ERC1, USP7 and TRIM33, which interact both with {beta}-catenin and SMAD4, key components of the Wnt and BMP signaling pathways. In conclusion, STUPPIT represents a powerful tool for labeling and capturing intermediary proteins between non-interacting partners, offering new insights into protein-protein interactions and advancing signal transduction research.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Although Greatwall represents a potential oncogene and prospective therapeutic target, our understanding of cellular and molecular consequences of chemical Greatwall inactivation remains limited. To address this, we introduce C-604, a highly selective Greatwall inhibitor, and characterise both immediate and long-term cellular responses to the chemical attenuation of Greatwall activity. We demonstrate that Greatwall inhibition causes systemic destabilisation of the mitotic phosphoproteome, premature mitotic exit and pleiotropic cellular pathologies. Importantly, we demonstrate that the cellular and molecular abnormalities linked to reduced Greatwall activity are specifically dependent on the B55 isoform rather than other B55 variants, underscoring PP2A-B55 phosphatases as key mediators of cytotoxic effects of Greatwall-targeting agents in human cells. Additionally, we show that sensitivity to Greatwall inhibition varies in different cell line models and that dependency on Greatwall activity reflects the balance between Greatwall and B55 expression levels. Our findings highlight Greatwall dependency as a cell-specific vulnerability and propose the B55-to-Greatwall expression ratio as a predictive biomarker of cellular responses to Greatwall-targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

While much research has focused on the function of protamines in sperm development and fertility, their effects in non-sperm cells remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the impact of overexpressing murine and human protamine 1 and 2 (PRM1 and PRM2) on nuclear architecture, histone eviction, DNA methylation, and transcription in HEK293T cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Overexpression of protamines resulted in nuclear condensation; particularly PRM1 showed notable enrichment in nucleoli, and cells exhibited cell cycle abnormalities. Immunofluorescence staining indicated a significant reduction in specific histone modifications (H3K9me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27Ac) in response to protamine expression, especially in MSCs. Interestingly, despite these changes in nuclear organization, the methylome remained largely stable. However, expression of protamines significantly diminished transcription, particularly of the ribosomal genes, upon PRM1 expression. Our studies indicate that PRM1 and PRM2 condense distinct genomic regions in somatic cells, resulting in widespread silencing of gene expression.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

However, recent engram research in mice suggests that the engrams of forgotten memories do persist. This raises the question whether engrams underlying human episodic memories also persist despite forgetting? And do forgotten memories influence human behavior implicitly? To address this question, 40 men and women learned 96 face-object pairs. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla we mapped the fate of the 96 memories at the systems level from learning to a 30-minute and onward to a 24-hour memory test. Upon each retrieval attempt, participants indicated whether they remembered or forgot the memory. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the functional brain data revealed that the engrams of forgotten memories remain implemented in the episodic memory network and continue to influence the accuracy of guessing responses at test. Overnight, the engrams of forgotten memories became implemented more deeply within bilateral hippocampus, while consciously accessible memories were neocorticalized overnight. The engrams of both consciously accessible and inaccessible (forgotten) memories were shifted from the 30-minute to the 24-hour retrieval within the right hippocampus and anterior cingulate gyrus such that pattern dissimilarities supported the correct retrieval responses at 24 hours. This is evidence that forgotten human episodic memories remain implemented in the episodic memory network and continue to influence human behavior implicitly.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Yet, the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying this ability, and how they depend on task demands, remain unclear. Here, we used multivariate decoding of magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses and source localization to characterize the emergence of invariant face representations. Human participants viewed natural images of highly familiar celebrities that systematically varied in viewpoint, gender, and age, while performing a one-back task on the identity or the image. Time-resolved decoding revealed that identity information emerged rapidly and became increasingly invariant to viewpoint over time. We observed a temporal hierarchy: view-specific identity information appeared at 64 ms, followed by mirror-invariant representations at 75 ms and fully view-invariant identity at 89 ms. Identity-invariant age and gender information emerged around the same time as view-invariant identity. Task demands modulated only late-stage identity and gender representations, suggesting that early face processing is predominantly feedforward. Source localization at peak decoding times showed consistent involvement of the occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA), with stronger identity and age signals than gender. Our findings reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the brain extracts view-invariant identity from familiar faces, suggest that age and gender are processed in parallel, and show that task demands modulate later processing stages. Together, these results offer new constraints on computational models of face perception.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

These circuits are usually complex in structure and contain an extensive diversity of cell types. The regulatory mechanisms that pattern circuits for instinctual behaviors have been challenging to elucidate. Here, we developed methods in Drosophila to transcriptionally profile identified neuronal stem cell lineages in the cerebrum. We applied this method to lineages that generate sex-differentiated neurons with known circuit roles. We identified 91 transcription factors that, in combinations of 6-8, delineate cerebral hemilineages - classes of postmitotic neurons born from the same stem cell and sharing Notch status. Hemilineages comprise the major anatomic classes in the cerebrum and these transcription factors are required to generate their gross features. We further identified 33 transcription factors characteristic of neuronal birth order within lineages; these subtly differentiate neuronal subtypes to provide common computational modules to circuits regulating different behaviors. Our findings suggest that hemilineage and birth order transcription factors operate in a hierarchical system to build, diversify, and sexually differentiate lineally-related neurons that compose complex instinctual circuits.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}

Our results demonstrate that cortical networks in the human brain differentially encode distinct cognitive states: we found unique brain states underlying creative thinking vs. arithmetic calculations, particularly in the default mode network. Further, in the dorsal attention network, we uncovered nonlinear, high-dimensional representations of moment-by-moment fluctuations in creative performance. These representations define a neural creativity axis shared between network-level and single-neuron computations.

In fact, two previous sets of spatial coordinates exist, and surprisingly, the accuracy of these coordinates in placing dissected tissue samples in correct anatomical locations within MNI space have not been examined. Here, we show that there are significant inaccuracies in the two previous sets of coordinates, and provide a refined set of coordinates as a resource to the neuroscience community.

C.; Cushing, C. W.; Ryan, M. J.", "abstract": "Many animals form behavioral collectives, and optimal interaction patterns often differ across social contexts. Sensory scenes generated by many interacting conspecifics are complex. Thus, maintaining socially-calibrated interaction patterns necessitates that individuals distill key features from conspecific scenes to guide continued adjustments to social fluctuations. Tungara frogs produce mating calls in choruses varying in density, and interaction patterns differ across social environments; rivals alternate their calls in smaller choruses, but increasingly overlap one anothers calls in a stereotyped fashion as choruses increase in density. We used automated playback to investigate the cues guiding this socially-mediated shift in response modes. We played conspecific stimulus calls to males at various delays relative to their own calls, preceded by various acoustic motifs mimicking conspecific interaction patterns observed across varied chorusing environments. Males almost never overlapped isolated stimulus calls at any delays. However, their probabilities of overlapping stimulus calls increased markedly when stimulus calls were preceded by motifs exhibiting intense conspecific stimulation patterns characteristic of larger choruses, especially when these stimulus calls were also presented at later delays. Thus, a multifaceted cue to social context primes varied interaction patterns on a call-by-call basis: that, in larger choruses, males experience intense conspecific stimulation during their inter-call periods, and that this stimulation extends throughout the latter reaches of their call cycles. Our results highlight that inactive phases within behavioral rhythms provide critical assessment windows for fine-tuning upcoming responses, and that behavioral rhythms act as crucial temporal filters for mapping conspecific stimulation patterns to behavioral outputs.", "date": "2025-06-03", "journal": ""}
