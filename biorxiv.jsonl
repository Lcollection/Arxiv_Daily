We tested the hypothesis that implicit causal inferences about biological processes (e.g., illness) depend on the animacy semantic network. Participants (n=20) undergoing fMRI read two-sentence vignettes that elicited causal inferences across sentences, either about the emergence of illness or about the mechanical breakdown of inanimate objects, in addition to noncausal control vignettes. All vignettes were about people and were linguistically matched. The same participants performed localizer tasks: language, logical reasoning, and mentalizing. Inferring illness causes, relative to all control conditions, selectively engaged a portion of the precuneus (PC) previously implicated in the semantic representation of animates (e.g., people, animals). Neural responses to causal inferences about illness were adjacent to but distinct from responses to mental state inferences, suggesting a neural mind/body distinction. We failed to find evidence for domain-general responses to causal inference. Implicit causal inferences are supported by content-specific semantic networks that encode causal knowledge.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Endogenous electric fields generated by disruption of the transepithelial potential across the skin have been postulated to play an important role in guiding cells to wound sites, though how individual cells sense these tissue-scale physical cues remains largely unknown. We have identified Galvanin (TMEM154), a previously uncharacterized single-pass transmembrane protein, as being required for electric-field-guided migration of individual rapidly moving cells. Galvanin functions in both immune and epithelial cell types. Upon exposure of cells to an electric field, Galvanin rapidly relocalizes to the anodal side of a cell, and the net charge on its extracellular domain is necessary and sufficient to drive this spatial relocalization. Furthermore, expression of Galvanin is sufficient to confer electric field-guided migration on otherwise non-responsive epithelial cells. In human neutrophils, we show that Galvanin relocalization is immediately followed by changes in the spatial pattern of cellular protrusion and retraction. The strong directional response of these cells is lost upon truncation of Galvanin's intracellular domain, suggesting that Galvanin acts as a direct sensor of the electric field, transducing spatial information about a cell's electrical environment to the intracellular migratory apparatus. This sensor relocalization mechanism of cell steering defines a new paradigm for directed cell migration.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Intriguingly, angiogenesis lags behind progesterone elevation, creating an avascular phase during which luteal cells must fuel intensive steroidogenesis without perfusion. How the avascular CL meets this energetic demand remains a mystery. Here, we reveal a novel cellular adaptive mechanism-GC energy storage (GCES)-that resolves this enigma. We demonstrate that upon luteinization initiation, GCs enter a metabolically quiescent state yet enhance glucose uptake via SLC2A1, converting the glucose into glycogen through the hCG (LH)-MAPK-RUNX1-Insulin signaling axis. Catabolism of this glycogen reserve supplies the energy required for the avascular CL, ensuring normal luteogenesis. GCES is evolutionarily conserved across species. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of GCES or glycogenolysis induces luteal insufficiency, whereas timely glucose administration enhances GCES, improving luteal function and optimize reproductive outcome in both mouse and ovine models. In human study, orally intake of glucose post-hCG significantly augments GCES and enhances progesterone production in women.

Duty-cycle subsampling is widely used to collect PAM data at regular ON/OFF cycles to circumvent battery and storage capacity constraints for long-term monitoring. However, the impact of duty-cycle subsampling and potential detector errors on estimating bat activity has not been systematically investigated for bats. Here, we simulate the influence of duty-cycle subsampling in measuring bat activity via three metrics - Call Rate (CR), Activity Index (AI), and Bout-Time Percentage (BTP) - using three months of continuous recordings spanning summer to fall in a temperate urban natural area. Our simulations show that subsampled bat activity estimates more accurately track true values when the listening ratio is high and the cycle length is low, when the true call activity is high, or when recorded calls have lower frequency content. Generally, among the three metrics, AI provides the best subsampling estimates and is robust against false negatives but sensitive to false positives, whereas BTP provides better temporal resolution compared to AI and is robust against both false positives and false negatives.

Here, we demonstrate that emergent coexistence can arise without intransitivity in competitive communities with pairwise interactions. First, we develop a simple trade-off model where interactions are competitive, transitive, and pairwise, yet coexistence is emergent. Second, we show that coexistence is typically emergent in well-known hierarchical trade-off models.

J.; Senes, A.", "abstract": "The factors that stabilize the folding and oligomerization of membrane proteins are still not well understood. In particular, it remains unclear how the tight and complementary packing between apolar side chains observed in the core of membrane proteins contributes to their stability. Complementary packing is a necessary feature since packing defects are generally destabilizing for membrane proteins. The question is the extent by which packing of apolar side chains -- and the resulting van der Waals interactions -- are a sufficient driving force for stabilizing the interaction between transmembrane helices in the absence of hydrogen bonding and polar interactions. We addressed this question with an approach based on high-throughout protein design and the homodimerization of single-pass helices as the model system. We designed hundreds of transmembrane helix dimers mediated by apolar packing in the backbone configurations that are most commonly found in membrane proteins. We assessed the association propensity of the designs in the membrane of Escherichia coli and found that they were most often monomeric or, at best, weakly dimeric. Conversely, a set of controls designed in the backbone configuration of the GASright motif, which is mediated by weak hydrogen bonds, displayed significantly higher dimerization propensity. The data suggest that packing of apolar side chains and van der Waals interactions may be a relatively weak force in driving transmembrane helix dimerization, unless highly optimized. It also confirms that GASright is a special configuration for achieving stability in membrane proteins.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Yet, the role of these two neuronal subpopulations and their inputs to the VP in stimulus-based decisions remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetics in female and male knock-in rats to selectively silence D1- or D2-SPNs and their projections to the VP at a time when the rats were required to use predictive stimuli to choose between two instrumental actions. Silencing either population of NAc-S SPNs disrupted choice. Silencing NAc-S D1-SPNs terminals in the VP also disrupted choice. However, choice was left intact by silencing NAc-S D2-SPNs terminals in the VP.

According to the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), unconscious sensory information remains relatively confined to sensory cortex and should not be capable of interacting with other modalities until it is broadcast into the (conscious) global workspace comprising late (>250ms) frontal-parietal activation. The ventriloquist effect is a classical multisensory integration phenomenon that refers to the misperception of sound location towards concurrent visual stimulation, such as perceiving the voice of a ventriloquist actor as coming from the moving dummy. Here we used meta-contrast masking to render a brief flash stimulus non-conscious while 30 participants (male, female, and non-binary) performed a sound localization task. We found that, despite being subjectively invisible and at chance at discriminating the flash location, participants were nevertheless biased to localize sounds towards the unconscious flash locations. The effect was present in virtually all participants, was nearly as large as the effect on conscious trials, and was robust to controls for individual differences in task performance. Decoding and ERP analyses of concurrently recorded EEG signals showed that the non-conscious flash location information was present up until around 220ms but not after; suggesting that the visual influence on sound perception may have occurred before conscious broadcast. In support of this, early decoding accuracy on non-conscious trials predicted individual variation in the size of the unconscious ventriloquist effect. Our findings suggest that subjective perception is not required for the integration of signals originating in distinct sensory modalities prompting new questions about the role of subjective perception in multisensory integration.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

They have been extensively studied in clinical bacteria, but their evolutionary role in phytopathogens remains underexplored. Here, we analysed complete genomes of Xanthomonas species to investigate the origin, distribution, and functional dynamics of integrons in this genus. We found that 93% of genomes harboured integrons. The integron-integrase gene intI was predominantly located downstream of ilvD, indicating an ancestral acquisition of integrons, predating diversification within the genus. Phylogenetic analyses support vertical inheritance of intI, with the exception of rare horizontal gene transfer events, notably in X. arboricola. Despite their widespread presence, full-length intI genes and active integron platforms are only retained in some species, especially X. campestris, which shows high integron gene cassette variability and functional integron activity. In contrast, species such as X. cissicola and X. phaseoli exhibit widespread intI inactivation, likely occurring early in their divergence, leading to more stable cassette arrays and conserved integron-associated phenotypes. The number and diversity of genes within cassette arrays varied significantly by species and, to a lesser extent, by the ecological context of plant host cultivation. While most cassettes encoded proteins without a known function, those with annotated roles were associated with stress response mechanism, competitive exclusion, and plant-associated functions. Together, our findings demonstrate that integrons in Xanthomonas likely originated from a single ancient acquisition event, preceding genus-wide speciation, and have co-evolved with Xanthomonas pathovars as they adapted to distinct plant hosts.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

We found their global genomic diversity being strongly associated with their body sites and tissue origins, but not with their host, geographical, or disease specificity. By reconciling time-resolved phylogenies of PVs and their hosts, we revealed a high-resolution view on how virus-host cospeciation, horizontal host switches, and duplication/loss turnovers collectively shaped the evolution of PVs. We identified key selection-driven mutations that defined the genus-specific divergence of PVs, with those underlying the rise of Alpha-PVs highly enriched in the N-terminal domain of E1 gene. Especially, we identified a group of risk-defining variant sites showing contrasting genotypes between low-risk and high-risk HPVs. With four independent PV genome cohorts, we further validated their high sensitivity and specificity on HPV risk classification even at single site level, underscoring their application values in large-scale HPV screening tests.

While nucleotide sequence and DNA shape are known determinants of TF binding, the role of DNA flexibility encompassing axial, torsional, and stretching dynamics remains largely unexplored, particularly across diverse TF families. Here, we systematically integrate experimentally and computationally derived DNA flexibility descriptors into predictive models of TF-DNA binding specificity. Through extensive analyses of large-scale in vitro datasets from HT-SELEX, SELEX-Seq, protein binding microarrays encompassing mammalian and Drosophila TFs, we demonstrate that flexibility-augmented models consistently outperform sequence based models, and DNA shape augmented models to an extent. These improvements are robust across diverse experimental platforms, and scale of the datasets, underscoring the importance of DNA conformational dynamics in indirect readout. Quantitative analyses of position-specific flexibility contributions reveal distinct \"flexibility hotspots\" within transcription factor binding sites and their flanking regions. This is exemplified by structural insights into the homeodomain TF MSX1, where localized DNA bendability directly correlates with enhanced binding affinity and precise recognition specificity. Finally, leveraging in vivo ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq data from ENCODE, we further validate that DNA flexibility substantially enhances the identification of functional TF binding sites across various TF families and cellular contexts.

Using a grid search of 36 parameter combinations, we evaluated four agronomic traits with a comprehensive suite of metrics: Pearson's r, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Fleiss' {kappa} for stability. Our findings demonstrate that a low learning rate combined with a high number of boosting rounds substantially improves prediction stability (ICC > 0.98) and selection stability (Fleiss Kappa > 0.80), while reducing train-test performance gaps. This combination produced concurrent improvements for predictive accuracy (r) and ranking efficiency (NDCG), though optimal settings were trait-dependent. Conversely, classification accuracy (AUC) was poor and performed relatively better with higher learning rates, revealing a conflict in optimization hyperparameters. Despite moderate Pearson's r and poor AUC in this challenging cross-season, cross-environment prediction scenario, NDCG remained high (> 0.85), indicating strong ability to rank top-performing entries.

Although the neural mechanisms that regulate this balance have been extensively studied at systems and physiological levels, relatively little is known about how the molecular properties of motor circuits influence motor stability versus flexibility. Here, we characterize the region- and cell-type specific expression patterns of neuropeptide systems across the neural circuit that controls the learning and performance of birdsong, a model for skilled behavior. We identify a number of neuropeptide pathways with differential expression between song regions and surrounding areas that are not involved in song production or learning. One of the strongest enriched genes in song regions is corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP), whose product binds corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), a neuropeptide implicated in neuronal excitability and plasticity. We find that the expression of CRHBP in the song motor pathway decreases upon deafening-induced song destabilization, increases during song acquisition, and increases the more a bird sings. CRH and CRHBP are expressed in distinct interneuronal populations in song motor regions, providing a local neuromodulatory circuit well-positioned to regulate song performance. Consistent with this role, genetic and pharmacological manipulation of the CRH pathway in the song motor pathway resulted in bidirectional modifications of song variability, with elevated CRHBP acting to maintain low variability and elevated CRH acting to increase variability.

In this study, we used in vivo genome editing to ablate expression of the Grin1 gene, which encodes the obligate GluN1 subunit of NMDARs, in neurons in the medial PFC of female and male adolescent mice. We assessed synaptic density and function in layer V pyramidal neurons at multiple time points using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, integrated with confocal imaging of dendritic spine architecture in recorded neurons. NMDAR ablation caused an early decrease in basilar dendritic spine density, followed by a rebound over baseline in spine density and a corresponding increase in AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. Inhibitory spontaneous neurotransmission was also increased, suggesting that synaptic compensation maintains an allostatic set point. Our findings demonstrate that NMDAR ablation initially disrupts local PFC networks, followed by recovery via compensatory processes that may be impaired in the disease state.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Recent work indicates that the RE plays a critical role in the acquisition and retrieval of fear extinction memories. Functional inactivation of the RE impairs both mPFC-HPC coherence and extinction memory. Here we examine whether imposing theta activity on the RE entrains oscillations in the mPFC and HPC and facilitates extinction learning. Methods: To deliver theta-paced (8 Hz) optogenetic stimulation, we expressed an excitatory opsin, (channelrhodopsin; AAV9-CaMKIIa-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry) or control virus (AAV9-CaMKIIa-mCherry) in the RE in male and female rats. A single optic fiber targeting the RE was implanted during the same surgery. After recovery, animals underwent auditory fear conditioning, extinction training, and an extinction retrieval test, each separated by 24-h. During extinction training, conditioned stimuli (CS) presentations were paired with 8-Hz sinusoidal optostimulation (473 nM, 10 mW) of the RE. In another experiment, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the mPFC and dorsal HPC during using these behavioral procedures. Results: Theta-paced stimulation of the RE during extinction training significantly decreased freezing behavior compared to the control group. Notably, the reduction in conditioned behavior was evident during the subsequent stimulation-free retrieval test. This reveals that RE stimulation during extinction not only suppresses conditioned fear responses acutely, but also facilitates the acquisition of long-term extinction memories. Theta-paced RE stimulation markedly enhanced both neural activity and entrained theta oscillations in the mPFC and dHPC. Conclusion: This work suggests that the RE oscillatory activity is critical for the acquisition of extinction memories through the modulation of hippocampal-prefrontal network dynamics. In the future, RE theta-paced stimulation can be an important therapeutic tool by strengthening extinction memories.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

W.; Wagner, G.", "abstract": "Marsupial pregnancy is strikingly short: placental attachment in the gray short-tailed opossum Monodelphis domestica lasts only two days. This brevity has been attributed to a maternal immune response to fetal contact which only eutherian mammals have evolved mechanisms to tolerate. The attachment period is characterized by a spike in inflammatory signaling, development of an expanded uterine capillary network, and exponential fetal growth. Several inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1A (IL-1A) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), are produced primarily by fetal cells. We hypothesized that placental cytokines function as solicitation signals that increase maternal investment. To test this, we treated pregnant opossums with inhibitors of IL-1 and IL-6 during the rapid growth phase. Inhibition of IL-1 and IL-6 signaling significantly increased average biomass per fetus (+12% and +10%), and as such these signals impose costs, rather than direct benefits, to intrauterine growth. However, uninhibited controls showed greater surviving litter sizes than IL-1-inhibited animals, suggesting that IL-1A promotes offspring survival. Single-cell transcriptomes reveal that maternal vascular endothelial cells, perivascular cells, and fibroblasts are the primary targets of fetal IL-1A, and maternal cells simultaneously upregulate antagonists IL1R2 and IL1RN, suggesting resistance to fetal signaling. Placental transcriptomics reveals that the cytokine surge is restricted to the final day of pregnancy when placental cells fuse to form syncytial knots, and that these cells produce additional vasomodulatory signals including a truncated isoform of VEGFA. Maternal cells, in contrast, increase production of functional antagonists IL1R2 and IL1RN, suggesting resistance to fetal signals. We propose that marsupials co-opted inflammatory signals to perform a novel function promoting fetal survival through maternal vascular remodeling.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Pb-exposed organoids contain a higher proportion of neurons and fewer astrocytes. We validated this differentiation bias in primary radial glia from human cortices (GW16-20), observing Pb-associated reductions in astrocyte commitment via genetic lineage tracing. This correlated with increased H3K27me3, a repressive histone modification deposited by the histone methyltransferase complex PRC2, suggesting epigenetic reprogramming as a mechanistic link between Pb and neural cell fate commitment.

Population neural trajectories provide a compact representation of high-dimensional activity, capturing both spatial configuration and temporal evolution. In the visual cortex, excitatory subtypes differ in laminar location, projection targets, and synaptic integration, yet most trajectory analyses pool mixed populations, obscuring subtype-specific contributions. Here, we compared trajectory geometries across three genetically defined excitatory subtypes-Cux2-CreERT2, Emx1-IRES-Cre, and Slc17a7-IRES2-Cre-in the mouse primary visual cortex, using large-scale two-photon calcium imaging data from the Allen Brain Observatory and five complementary structural metrics. Across all metrics, Cux2 neurons exhibited consistently smaller trajectory scales than the other two types, with medium effect sizes stable across time windows, stimulus orientations, and leave-one-out validation. Emx1 and Slc17a7 populations showed broadly overlapping profiles, with the largest differences emerging in the mid-response window, corresponding to the sensory integration phase of population dynamics. These findings reveal distinct geometric signatures imposed by excitatory subtypes: Cux2 circuits favor localized, stable representations, whereas Emx1 and Slc17a7 circuits support broader, distributed integration.

It can be sustained on a given location or feature, or re-oriented between locations or between features, enabling attentional exploration. Sustained attention was associated with alpha (8-12Hz) oscillations. More recently, authors suggested that exploratory attention was instead related to theta (4-7Hz). To date, there is no systematic evaluation of attentional exploration across stimulus dimensions (space, features) in relation to theta oscillations. Using attentional cueing and electroencephalography (EEG) in humans, we assessed exploration of stimulus dimension during the (1) precue-to-stimulus (first attentional orienting) and (2) post-stimulus (during stimulus processing) trial periods. In the precue-to-stimulus period, we classified the cued dimension (attending to a location/feature) from EEG topographies to assess the neural dynamics of sustained and exploratory attentional orienting. Temporal generalization matrices showed oscillatory patterns of classification accuracies across time. When attention was sustained on a cued location but explored the feature dimension as the target feature was unknown, only the alpha frequency was observed. When attention was sustained on a cued feature but explored locations, both alpha and theta frequencies were observed. Focusing on post-stimulus theta oscillations revealed increased theta power in invalid trials (attention reorients from the precued distractor location/feature to the target, i.e., exploration) relative to valid trials in both feature-based and spatial attention conditions. Post-stimulus theta oscillations further predicted behavioral performance. Together, our results show that while alpha oscillations are associated with sustained attention regardless of the attended dimension, theta oscillations are specifically related to spatial exploration.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Given their established contribution in generating gamma oscillations, parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are prime candidates for regulating spontaneous cerebral blood flow (CBF) dynamics. Using chemogenetic tools in awake PV-Cre mice, we modulated PV interneuron activity and measured effects on neural network activity, local field potentials (LFP), and hemodynamics. Two-photon (2P) calcium imaging confirmed effective PV modulation, which affected excitatory neuron activity. PV suppression reduced high-gamma power, increased low-frequency LFP activity, and elevated basal CBF. 2P vessel imaging showed increased basal arterial diameter and significantly greater diameter fluctuation power in deeper cortical layers enriched with PV cells, but not in superficial layers. PV suppression also significantly weakened the correlation between gamma LFP power and CBF. Despite increased apparent neuronal synchrony during PV suppression, its relationship to arterial dynamics remained stable, possibly due to compensatory regulation by subsets of PV-positive and PV-negative cells. These findings provide causal evidence that PV interneuron contribute to spontaneous neurovascular dynamics and mediate the link between gamma oscillations and resting-state hemodynamic signals, revealing their significant role in maintaining functional connectivity and vascular regulation during non-task-engaged brain states.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

While segregation of different audio streams is mostly accomplished in the auditory cortex, it remains unclear whether the inner ear, where the sound detection occurs, already contributes to selective attention. In particular, the cochlea possesses an active process enabling it to amplify sound in a frequency-dependent manner. A physiological correlate of the active process are distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) that can be measured non-invasively from the ear canal. Here we employed speech-DPOAEs that are connected to the spectral structure of voiced speech to show that these emissions are modulated by selective attention to one of two competing voices. We found that speech-DPOAEs evoked by the resolved harmonics of a voice were significantly reduced when that voice was attended as compared to when it was ignored. No such effect was observed for the unresolved harmonics of the target voice when the competing voice's harmonics in that range were unresolved as well, indicating that attentional modulation is specific to those components of voiced speech that are spectrally resolved. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that selective attention to speech in noise is already shaped by the inner ear's active process.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Lethal and sub-viable knockout mouse lines require whole-embryo imaging to connect genotype to phenotype (Dickinson et al., 2016; Cacheiro et al., 2022). Because many lethal strains cannot be evaluated postnatally, standardized embryonic pipelines acquire late-gestation 3D images to capture whole-embryo morphology and viability (Dickinson et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2013). Moreover, there are often far fewer samples of in-class (e.g., homozygous knockouts) than wildtypes or normative samples. Such extreme subject-level imbalance degrades both statistical anatomy and deep learning, often yielding saliency maps that highlight noise rather than lesion-specific signal (Adebayo et al., 2018; Buda et al., 2018; Johnson & Khoshgoftaar, 2019). We therefore asked whether focal loss [Lin et al., 2017] in combination with model-capacity control and seed ensembling can stabilize explanations without compromising classification accuracy. Exencephaly is an open neural-tube defect characterized by absence of the cranial vault and exposure of disorganized neural tissue (Greene & Copp, 2014). In our late-gestation screen, approximately 10% of embryos were affected, creating severe class imbalance and underscoring the need for interpretable automation. As a test case for imbalance-aware, interpretable phenotyping, we analyzed 253 diceCT scans of E15.5 embryos (24 with exencephaly). A self-supervised transformer was fine-tuned with three regimes: cross-entropy (CE-Large), focal-loss equal-capacity (FL-Large) and focal-loss reduced-capacity (FL-Small). Five random seeds per regime yielded 15 models. Integrated Gradients saliency was quantified, and explanation quality was measured by saliency entropy (sparsity), cross-seed Dice/Jaccard similarity (reproducibility), and expert visual inspection. All 15 models achieved near perfect phenotype recognition on held-out data with 0.996 {+/-} 0.002 mean accuracy with some seeds/regimens reached 1.000. Focal loss reduced saliency entropy by up to 1.5 bits and doubled cross-seed Dice overlap, concentrating attribution on the malformed cranial vault. Ensemble-averaged heat-maps show that both focal-loss regimes concentrate attribution on the malformed cranial vault while suppressing spurious body-wide signals. Focal loss, modest capacity, and seed ensembling within a modified M3T transformer yielded sparse, reproducible, anatomically focused saliency while preserving perfect sensitivity. This supports trustworthy high-throughput phenotyping in severely imbalanced embryo screens. The workflow relies only on standard atlas registration and image pre-processing, requires no voxel-level annotations, and is readily adaptable to other structural malformations and developmental stages.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Thematic coding was used to identify key challenges, opportunities, and best practices to enhance citizen science initiatives. Additionally, nine case studies were reported using the Standardised Data on Initiatives (STARDIT) reporting tool. The study identifies key strategies for enhancing participant engagement and retention in citizen science initiatives. Findings underscore the importance of inclusive, evidence-informed approaches such as targeted outreach, fair compensation, tailored support, and co-creation practices. Ensuring data quality and fostering trust require adherence to FAIR data principles, transparent validation and sharing processes, and the establishment of ethical research partnerships. Persistent challenges include short-term funding, which undermines long-term project sustainability, and the lack of centralized support for ethics and project management. Formal recognition of citizen scientists through co-authorship, standardized training, and professional development opportunities can further strengthen involvement and build capacity. Finally, emerging technologies--including AI and open data platforms--present opportunities to scale and improve efficiency, provided they are implemented with appropriate ethical safeguards and investment. Drawing together these insights, we provide 10 actionable recommendations for citizen science in the 21st century. These highlight the importance of embedding citizen science in national research infrastructure, education, and policy, alongside consistent evaluation and reporting, to improve its inclusivity, longevity, and impact.

Although telomere length (TL) is critical for normal telomere function, its functional status can also be altered by many other factors. The organization and protective status of telomere in failing human heart (FHH) remains incompletely understood. Methods: Using left ventricular tissues from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and non-failing heart (NFH), we performed a comprehensive analysis that included measurements of overall TL and 3' overhang length in left ventricles and cardiomyocytes (CM), assessment of telomere-binding protein associations, and transcriptomic profiling through RNA sequencing. Results: Although TL varied among individuals, reduced median TL was observed only in IDC, while both IDC and IHD showed an increased frequency of very short telomeres, falling below the 5th percentile, in CMs. Strikingly, significant telomere 3'-overhang attrition was detected in both disease groups and strongly correlated with elevated H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139 ({gamma}H2AX) in heart tissues, indicating DNA damage. This was accompanied by persistent activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein-mediated DNA damage responses and the formation of telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) in CMs from FHH. Concomitantly, the association of telomeres with the single-stranded telomere-binding protein, Protection of Telomeres 1 (POT1), and the double-stranded telomere-interacting protein, telomere repeat-binding factor 2 (TERF2), was markedly reduced, accompanied by an increase in association of {gamma}H2AX and ssDNA binding protein, RPA with telomeres in IDC and IHD relative to NFH, signifying telomere de-protection. Conclusions: CM telomere dysfunction, characterized by 3' overhang attrition and de-protection, is a common feature in FHH, leading to persistent DNA damage response in telomeres.

Distinct classes of RAF inhibitors have been developed, particularly for BRAFV600E, but their potencies against the three RAF isoforms have not been systematically compared. Here we biochemically characterize monomeric and dimeric preparations of ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF and measure the potencies of a panel of thirteen type I, type I.5, and type II RAF inhibitors against each active RAF preparation. Type I inhibitor SB590885 is roughly equipotent across RAF isoforms and, as expected, type I.5 inhibitors are typically most potent against BRAFV600E. Despite their reputation as pan-RAF inhibitors, type II inhibitors as a class are potent inhibitors of CRAF but exhibit relative sparing of ARAF and intermediate potencies against BRAF. Type II compounds inhibit BRAF and CRAF with marked positive cooperativity, and their apparent potencies are insensitive to ATP-concentrations. Crystal structures of CRAF in complex with type I.5 inhibitor PLX4720 reveal an asymmetric CRAF dimer with one CRAF subunit bound in the inactive state and the second bound in an aC-helix-in, active conformation with an altered inhibitor pose.

S.; Zia, R. N.", "abstract": "Nucleoid compaction in bacterial cells has been attributed to cytoplasmic crowding, supercoiling effects, and the action of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). In most bacteria, including E. coli, these mechanisms condense the nucleoid to a smaller volume within the cell, excluding most ribosomes to the surrounding cytoplasm. In contrast, the nucleoid in many Mycoplasmas, including the Mycoplasma-derived synthetic cell JCVI-Syn3A, spans the entire cell, with ribosomes distributed throughout. Recent models of Syn3A representing only DNA and ribosomes (both charge neutral) instantiated the experimentally-observed expanded nucleoid and ribosome distribution. However, we found that this configuration becomes dynamically unstable, giving way to a compacted nucleoid that expels ribosomes to the periphery, suggesting the need for a more detailed model. Speculation emerging from recent studies of Syn3A suggests that its lower concentration of NAPs underlie its expanded nucleoid. We are interested in this genotype-to-`physiotype'-to-phenotype implication: that coupled transcription, translation, and nucleoid remodeling lead to different phenotypical outcomes. We developed a coarse-grained computational model of Syn3A, physically and explicitly representing ribosomes, cytoplasmic proteins, and a sequence-accurate chromosome with physiological distributions of size, charge, and relative molecular abundance. An interplay between Brownian dynamics, DNA stiffness (both inherent and NAP-enhanced), and electrostatic charge led naturally to a stable molecular distribution. We find that an interplay between inherent and induced DNA stiffness, heterogeneous mesh size, and crowding enhances nucleoid compaction and ribosome expulsion via a competition between entropic and enthalpic forces. In contrast, electrostatic interactions and size-polydispersity counteract these effects and expand the nucleoid. In particular, Syn3A's atypically high abundance of positively-charged proteins shields ribosomes' negative charge, allowing them to interpenetrate the nucleoid. Finally, we observe condensate formation arising from electrostatic interactions with potential implications on transcription and translation rates.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Macroscale attributes such as statistical tests for a discrete network s heavy-tailed connectivity distribution generally distinguish bona fide biotic and protobiotic networks (E. coli heterotrophy, pruned protometabolism, KEGG) from abiotic networks but with two significant exceptions (radiolytic network and the Open Reaction Database). Microscale attributes such as an analysis of the frequency of a set of six primitive reaction motifs shows a depletion of some motifs in all chemical networks and the prevalence of others in specific networks; all networks were readily distinguishable from random network variants across all motifs. A comparison of the chemical spaces spanned by the different networks points to similarity and dissimilarity relationships between networks. Independent component analysis of an aggregate of all measured attributes, across all contexts, reliably distinguishes abiotic, prebiotic and biotic networks from one another. The combination of macro- and microscale attributes forms an agnostic toolset that may help to evaluate the prebiotic plausibility of different candidate settings for the origins of life, and may inform new ways of detecting and recognizing living systems (engineered or extraterrestrial) that differ from Terran biochemistry.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

MHC II is critical for CD4+ T cell activation and host immunity during Mtb infection. We hypothesized that NRF2 regulates the MHC II pathway and AM antigen presentation to T cells. We found that NRF2 inhibits MHC II, but not MHC I, specifically in AMs, following Mtb infection in vitro and in vivo. NRF2 dampens Ciita and H2-Ab1 gene expression in uninfected AMs, and MHC II inhibition by NRF2 is retained following innate stimuli and IFN{gamma} exposure. NRF2 expression in Mtb-infected AMs impedes their ability to activate ESAT6-specific CD4+ T cells. Thus, although NRF2 expression enhances cell-protective functions, it has the unexpected consequence of limiting innate-adaptive crosstalk, which can impair CD4+ T cell activation and host immunity during Mtb infection.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Among its many functions, the liver orchestrates systemic bile acid (BA) metabolism, a pathway disrupted in chronic liver diseases such as viral hepatitis. BAs have become increasingly recognized for their immunomodulatory properties, and multiple BA species are being explored as therapeutic agents in liver diseases. Understanding the interplay between immune responses and BA metabolism could unlock new therapeutic opportunities based on BA modulation. Using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as a model, we investigated the interplay between chronic hepatotropic virus infection, BA metabolism and immunity. Our findings reveal that chronic LCMV infection increases BA levels and shifts circulating and liver BA composition towards host-derived, conjugated BAs. At the same time, hepatic BA transport and synthesis genes are broadly downregulated, which is at least partially dependent on CD8+ T cells. Additionally, we found that sustained high BA levels impact CD8+ T cell responses to chronic LCMV infection. Mice with elevated circulating BAs due to the lack of BA transporters OATP1a and OATP1b, showed impaired T cell expansion and reduced liver immunopathology. These findings reveal a reciprocal interplay between CD8+ T cells and BA metabolism, expanding our understanding of adaptive immunity against viral hepatitis.

The goal was to understand the metabolic dynamics that enable this bacterium to efficiently utilize a dairy by-product and produce value-added compounds. Intracellular metabolites were profiled at the early (6 h) and late (18 h) exponential growth phases, revealing a distinct temporal metabolic reprogramming. Multivariate analysis and correlation networks confirmed significant metabolic shifts, where the early phase was characterized by active uptake and utilization of diverse sugars and fatty acids to support rapid proliferation. In contrast, the late phase demonstrated a metabolic reorientation towards energy production, redox balance, and stress adaptation. This was evidenced by the significant accumulation of key metabolites such as lactic acid, nicotinamide, and trehalose, which are crucial for maintaining growth and tolerance in an acidifying environment. Overall, the findings demonstrate that P. pentosaceus NCDC 273 possesses the metabolic flexibility to effectively channel whey derived sugars into central metabolism, while concurrently deploying adaptive strategies for survival.

C. C.; Leon, A.; Waymel, E.; Barais, A.; Porta, B.; Chourrout, D.; Henriet, S.", "abstract": "In eukaryotes, splicing is a critical step of gene expression that produces transcripts competent for protein synthesis by removing introns from pre-mRNA. The spliceosome defines target splice sites based on sequences located around intron ends and in almost all cases, spliced segments begin with a GT and end with an AG. The key molecules for this function are the spliceosomal RNA (snRNA) and the U2AF heterodimer, which interact with splice signals found at the ends of introns. In chordates, tunicate genomes in the family Fritillariidae (Lohmann, 1915) form a remarkable exception by hosting numerous introns that escape the GT/AG rule, and they represent a material of choice to address the evolution of intron recognition. A comparison of chordate genomes revealed that the emergence of the unusual splicing code in Fritillaria borealis was accompanied by the duplication of its subunits U2AF1 and U2AF2. We found that the conserved duplicates bind to canonical splice signals on RNA, but different binding was seen with the divergent versions U2AF1{beta} and U2AF2{beta}, suggesting they could recognize other splice sites. When expressed in mammalian cells, U2AF2{beta} promotes the removal of introns that have a weak polypyrimidine tract, and we also show that it interacts specifically with AHCYL1/2, a protein that can regulate the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of snRNA U2 and U6. In striking contrast with other species, F. borealis has lost m6A on the U6 snRNA while U1 snRNA has gained a stable, 5'-terminal m6A. We used structure prediction to show how these modifications could play decisive roles during the recognition of non-GT/AG introns. Our study suggests that discrete changes implemented on the spliceosome during the evolution of Fritillariidae have contributed to a dramatic shift in splice site identity.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

While Risdiplam has a preference to induce exons with a NGA sequence at the 3' exon end, Branaplam has a proclivity towards introducing AGA-ending exons. However, the variables that determine the selectivity and specificity of splicing modulators are still not completely understood, as evidenced by the hundreds of unaffected NGA-ending exons present in the human genome. In this study, we delve into the molecular mechanisms governing the specificity of splicing-modifying compounds, focusing on their interactions with RNA structures at splice sites. Using biochemical assays, whole transcriptome analyses, and genetic perturbation approaches, our findings reveal contributions of primary sequence dependencies that help determine the required secondary structural conformation, thus governing responsiveness to splicing-modulator induction.

Understanding organisms abilities to adapt and acclimate to stressors in their environments is essential for predicting the distributions and persistence of species and populations during environmental change. Beyond genetic adaptation, prior experiences with a given stressor across life stages can dictate how an individual will fare when exposed to that stressor again. There is now a robust literature on the impacts of parental experiences on offspring traits (transgenerational plasticity), plus an even broader literature on the carry-over effects of early-life experience on phenotypic outcomes (within-generational or developmental plasticity); however, less is understood about the relative strengths of these two forms of plasticity and how they interact to shape stress tolerance. 2.) We explored these questions by conducting a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed studies that tested both within- and transgenerational effects of naturally occurring environmental stressors. In particular, we explored contextual moderators or predictor variables including the traits measured, the type of stressor, taxonomic group, and organismal life history traits to elucidate patterns and develop a predictive framework for when we should expect to see effects of transgenerational plasticity, within-generational plasticity, both, or neither. 3.) We found that there was not a strong or consistent directional effect of either parental or early-life exposure on subsequent offspring traits. Instead, experimental context (what stressor was used and what traits were measured) as well as biological context (taxonomy, life history traits) were important predictors for understanding the strength and direction of plasticity. We found several contexts where there were meaningful effects of parental and early-life stress exposure and where there was evidence that these may interact to impact phenotypic and fitness outcomes. 4.) Our study highlights the need for careful consideration of context when exploring patterns of plasticity. We hope to underscore the need for additional, fully factorial studies that measure the interaction between these forms of plasticity across a variety of systems and stressors to better understand how stress may carry forward across life stages and generations.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

While masked language modeling (MLM)-based approaches, such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer (NT), achieve strong performance, they are hindered by inefficiencies due to partial token supervision, pre-training/fine-tuning mismatches, and high computational costs. We introduce NucEL, the first ELECTRA-style pre-training framework for genomic foundation models, which overcomes these challenges. Through a discriminator network identifying tokens modified by a generator, NucEL achieves comprehensive token-level supervision across all sequence positions, thereby markedly improving training efficiency relative to the partial supervision of masked positions inherent in MLM frameworks. By integrating ModernBERT's architectural advancements, including hybrid local-global attention and flash attention mechanisms, NucEL establishes an optimized BERT architecture for genomic sequence modeling. Unlike traditional methods that tokenize genomic sequences into 6-mers, NucEL implements single-nucleotide tokenization, enabling fine-grained resolution and improving both efficiency and interpretability. Pre-trained on the human genome only, NucEL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets across diverse downstream tasks in both human and non-human species, including regulatory element identification (e.g., promoters, enhancers), transcription factor binding prediction in human and mouse, open chromatin region classification, and histone modification profiles, surpassing MLM-based models of similar size and rivaling models 25 times larger, such as NT.

Khaya grandifoliola C.DC (Meliaceae), used in ethnomedicine to treat infections and liver-related ailments, shows promise as an antiviral agent. While its efficacy against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known, its effects on HEV remain underexplored. Aims of the Study: This study evaluates K. grandifoliola hydro-ethanolic extract (KHE) as a potential source of HEV inhibitor, focusing on the HEV papain-like cysteine protease (HEV-PLpro). Materials and Methods: Phytochemical profiling of KHE was performed using a Waters-Acquity UHPLC-MS system. The recombinant HEV-PLpro, expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified via nickel-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography, was used to screen KHE antiviral activity. The IC50 and inhibition mechanism were determined using the fluorogenic substrate Z-RLRGG-AMC. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations predicted interactions and analyzed the stability of KHE compounds with HEV-ORF1 (PDB ID: 6NU9). Additionally, HEV replication inhibition and cytotoxicity were evaluated in Huh7.5 cells using a Gaussia luciferase reporter system and MTT assay, respectively. Results: Eighteen compounds comprising flavonoid-O-glycosides, polyflavonoids, phenolic and terpene glycoside among other were successfully identified. KHE exhibited mixed-type inhibition of HEV-PLpro proteolytic activity, with an IC50 of 20.86 ug/mL, comparable to ribavirin (19.13 ug/mL), acting as competitive inhibitor. Notably, quercetin-3-[rhamnosyl-(1[-&gt;]2)--L-arabinopyranoside] and quercitrin exhibited stronger binding affinities (-7.68 and -7.43 kcal/mol) and greater structural stability, robustness, and compactness than ribavirin (-4.87 kcal/mol). In cell-based assays, KHE suppressed HEV replication more effectively than ribavirin (IC: 12.75 ug/mL vs. 17.96 ug/mL), with no cytotoxicity at [&le;]100 ug/mL. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that KHE exhibits potent anti-HEV activity by inhibiting both viral protease function and replication, likely attributable to its flavonoid-rich composition. Its mixed-type inhibition mechanism and favorable safety profile underscore its potential as promising source of lead candidate for HEV therapeutics.

We investigated whether the traditional paradigm that chromatographic performance directly correlates with proteome depth still holds true. Spanning a matrix of experiments with five distinct stationary phases, including C18 chemistries, C8, and Phenyl-Hexyl, across eight column lengths (40-140 mm), we evaluate protein identification performance using data-independent acquisition (DIA) on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer.

While distinct selectivity fingerprints persisted across chemistries, these chromatographic differences did not translate into meaningful variations in proteome coverage under high-speed acquisition conditions at 200 Hz. We conclude that the analytical bottleneck has fundamentally shifted from chromatographic resolution to mass spectrometric sampling efficiency, where comprehensive peptide identification is now gained through advanced spectral deconvolution rather than physical separation alone.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous signaling molecule, has been shown to regulate cellular migration in a cell type and context-dependent manner. Keratinocytes are the predominant cell-type in the epidermis and drive re-epithelialization during wound healing. However, the effect of H2S on keratinocyte migration remains incompletely defined. Here, we demonstrate that H2S suppresses keratinocyte migration in a serum-restricted in vitro scratch assay. Intracellular H2S levels were modulated using fast-releasing donors H2S donors (NaHS or Na2S) to achieve supraphysiological levels or by siRNA knockdown of endogenous H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CGL) and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) to obtain infraphysiological levels. Treatment with NaHS or Na2S (10 {micro}M - 5 mM, 24 h) reduced gap closure in a dose-dependent fashion, with negligible effects at <100 {micro}M and progressive suppression at higher concentrations. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of CGL or CBS boosted keratinocyte migration by 30% versus scrambled siRNA control. Supplementation with a slow-release H2S donor rescued the siCGL phenotype, restoring migration to control levels. Across experiments, intracellular H2S level is negatively associated with keratinocyte migration. These findings suggest that H2S can restrain keratinocyte motility under serum-restricted conditions, and that reports of accelerated wound closure with H2S donors in vivo may reflect effects on other cell types and/or inflammatory pathways rather than direct enhancement of keratinocyte migration.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Further, many methods require setting thresholds or parameter values a priori without providing any statistical basis, limiting the comparability of results. Here, we introduce Consecutive Non-Insertions Sites (ConNIS), a novel method for gene essentiality determination. ConNIS provides an analytic solution for the probability of observing insertion-free sequences within genes of given length and considers variation in insertion density across the genome. Based on an extensive simulation study and real world scenarios, ConNIS was found to be superior to prevalent state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with a low or medium insertion density.

D.; Zhang, J.; Cong, Q.; Grishin, N.", "abstract": "The development of highly accurate protein structure prediction algorithms has led to an explosion of structural data, transforming our understanding of protein structure-function relationships across diverse organisms. Domain classifications such as the Evolutionary Classificatioxn of Protein Domains (ECOD) have incorporated these computational predictions alongside experimental structures to create comprehensive resources for the research community. The AlphaFold Database (AFDB) plays a unique role, providing millions of predicted structures that ECOD has systematically classified for human proteins, small pathogens, and reference proteomes. Here, we extend this classification framework to the Swiss-Prot/UniProtKB dataset, applying the Domain Parser for AlphaFold Models (DPAM) pipeline to classify domains from over 542,000 Swiss-Prot protein structure predictions, resulting in more than 1,032,000 classified domains. These domains span 3,493 ECOD topologies and display high assignment confidence (mean DPAM probability: 0.992), with extensive taxonomic and functional diversity. Notably, over 100,000 domains lack existing Pfam mappings, indicating novel evolutionary groups. These results significantly expand ECODs coverage into a functionally and taxonomically diverse protein space, anchoring high-confidence structure predictions in an evolutionary framework. By integrating Swiss-Prot predictions, we enhance the utility and interpretability of AlphaFold models and establish a foundation for future large-scale, functionally informed domain classifications.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

First, experimental evidence is automatically leveraged to refine predictions, specifically, RNA-Seq coverage to inform gHMM gene prediction, and intron lengths to inform protein sequence alignments. Second, a consensus is created from an empirically optimized weighting of gene models from multiple sources. Third, Eukan runs a post-annotation routine to recover gene models missing from the consensus that otherwise have strong transcript support and appear to be protein-coding. We compare the results of Eukan with those of three popular freely-available pipelines (Maker, Braker, Gemoma) on 17 phylogenetically diverse haploid and diploid nuclear genomes. In addition to the commonly reported annotation accuracy statistics, we define a novel classification system of critical defects commonly observed in automated annotations. Furthermore, we developed a statistical model that demonstrates each of the tested pipelines correctly identified the majority of the validated \"Gold Standard\" gene models across the test set, but each pipeline uniquely generates a non-negligible portion of either fragmented, artificially fused, or missing gene models. Despite that, we demonstrate that Eukan performs consistently well where other pipelines encounter challenges, such as for compact protist genomes.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Active matter presents a fundamentally different challenge, components continuously consume energy to generate forces, creating a dual identity as both structural elements and force-generating machines. This material--machine duality raises a fundamental question: which structural parameters govern functional behavior in systems where constituents actively generate forces rather than merely responding to external inputs? Here we demonstrate that percolation is the critical mechanism that transforms active cytoskeletal networks from energy-dissipating materials into work-performing machines. Using light-controlled microtubule-kinesin networks, we show that increasing bundle length from 0.9 m to 5 m triggers a percolation transition that enables global force organization. Networks below the threshold remain incapable of performing coordinated work, while networks above it develop correlation lengths exceeding 240 m, generate 25-fold stronger forces, and extract 1000-fold more mechanical work, powering transport of live cells across 800 m distances. Network simulations reveal that introducing just 5-10% longer bundles creates a connected component containing 90% of microtubules, establishing the precise threshold that drives this material-to-machine transition. Our findings establish percolation as the fundamental mechanism governing whether active matter systems function as passive materials or as coordinated machines--providing design principles for both synthetic and biological systems.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we developed a 3D spheroid model of head and neck cancer using FaDu cells and compared it directly to a corresponding in vivo model in a radiotherapy setting. The spheroids exhibited key tumor-like features, including the formation of a hypoxic core and growth kinetics comparable to in vivo tumors. Importantly, the model allowed for long-term monitoring of tumor growth and radiation response. Upon X-ray irradiation, dose-response behavior in spheroids mirrored that observed in vivo. Furthermore, TiO2, HfO2, and Au nanoparticles demonstrated consistent radiosensitization effects in both systems when matched for uptake mass. In contrast, conventional 2D clonogenic assays failed to predict in vivo performance, likely due to their lower radioresistance and unrealistic nanoparticle exposure conditions.

Here, using MetTag, a single-cell barcoding and transcriptome profiling approach with time-stamped BC.IDs, we mapped temporal, clonal dynamics of DTCs and the immune cell landscape across ovarian cancer metastatic niches. Deep sequencing of barcodes revealed preferred enrichment of early-disseminated clones across metastatic niches. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with velocity analyses in ascites and metastasis-bearing omentums uncovered an emergent, distinct interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}) centric transcriptional trajectory, enriched among early seeding clones. Moreover, in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening of metastatic niche-specific signatures demonstrated that genes belonging to the ascites IFN{gamma} signature, including Marco, Gbp2b, and Slfn1, are functionally important for peritoneal metastasis. Knockout of IFN{gamma} receptor 1 (Ifngr1) in tumor cells significantly reduced metastatic burden and extended survival, underscoring the importance of tumor cell intrinsic IFN{gamma} signaling in ovarian cancer metastasis. Furthermore, we identified that the tumor intrinsic IFN{gamma} response and ascites-derived tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) protect cancer cells from anoikis-mediated death within the IFN{gamma}-rich ascites environment.

Cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) promotes aberrant RNA transcription in cancer and is a promising target for cancer therapies. Methods: Using CRC cell lines as well as newly established patient-derived organoid models of CRC, we studied the clinically promising CDK9 inhibitors (AZD4573, BAY1125152/VIP152/enitociclib, and NVP2) to determine their therapeutic potential. We investigated the efficacy and mechanisms of action through cell growth and cytotoxicity assays, RNAseq, immunoblotting, and IHC. Results: We found CDK9 inhibitors to be highly potent against CRC, through suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Our results demonstrated CDK9 inhibitors to be broadly active against a set of CRC models derived from a diverse patient population. Our mechanistic studies showed significant suppression of the Mitogen-active protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway due to CDK9 inhibitor treatment, suggesting that CDK9 inhibitor efficacy could be enhanced when combined with MAPK pathway inhibitors. As proof-of-concept, we found that CDK9 inhibitors and MEK inhibitors could be combined to synergistically suppress CRC growth and survival. Conclusions: CDK9 inhibitors show promising activity against patient-derived models of CRC. MAPK signaling is particularly suppressed by CDK9 inhibitors. Combining CDK9 inhibitors and targeted therapy against MAPK signaling pathway may be a viable strategy worthy of further investigation preclinically and clinically.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

In order to establish in the liver, metastatic cells require a metastatic niche providing prosurvival signals. Here, we demonstrate that bone marrow derived cells (BMDCs) establish immunosuppressive niches in the liver that promote metastatic colonization in PDAC. Using an immunocompetent orthotopic PDAC mouse model, we show that BMDCs form clusters enriched in myeloid progenitors and display upregulation of migratory, adhesive, and immunoregulatory programs in response to tumor derived cues. CD44 and its splice variant CD44v6 are found to be highly expressed on these cells. Hematopoietic specific deletion of Cd44 or Cd44v6 using Cd44/Cd44v6fl/fl;VavCreERT2 mice markedly impairs BMDC clustering, reshapes the BMDC transcriptome, disrupting pathways critical for migration, adhesion, and immunosuppression thereby reducing metastatic burden. Mechanistically, CD44 inhibition blocks BMDC migration toward CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL12, and impairs adhesion to VCAM-1 and fibronectin. Functionally, Cd44 deficient BMDCs exhibit reduced expression of immunosuppressive mediators such as Arginase 1, Ido1, and Il10, and fail to suppress T cell proliferation.

In this study, the analysis was enhanced by introducing the second-order Poincare plot, where axes represented interval increments rather than consecutive intervals. Using data from healthy subjects at rest and during classical music listening, it was demonstrated that this method filtered out the elliptical shape observed in traditional Poincare plots, which reflected slow HRV, thereby emphasizing faster variability. Ring-shaped patterns emerged in the plots for several participants, indicating heart rate correlation with respiratory cycles. For the other subjects, the plots displayed point clouds with positive, negative, or no serial correlation. Further analysis revealed that positive correlation arose during slow breathing, while negative correlation occurred with rapid breathing, corresponding to the ratio between respiratory frequency and heart rate. A simple oscillator model - consisting of a fast (cardiac) oscillator modulated by a slow (respiratory) oscillator - confirmed these findings. Although the study is primarily focused on HRV, the second-order Poincare plot holds potential for broader applications in physiological and neurophysiological signal analysis.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

Often, host-associated organisms are described in terms of metapopulations, wherein individual hosts act as habitat patches for their symbionts.

In this study, we investigated the metabolic consequences of CysLTR1 deletion in mice via GC-TOFMS-based metabolomics analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from both CysLTR1 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. The BALF from CysLTR1 KO mice presented significantly reduced levels of glucose, gluconic acid, sedoheptulose, D-xylose, glucosamine, glyceric acid, and 1-methylinosine, indicating impaired glucose uptake and dysregulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Further disruption of glucose-associated pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway and purine metabolism, alongside reduced 1-methylinosine levels, suggests altered RNA turnover. In addition, decreases in butanoic acid, decan-2-ol, and 1-hexadecanol indicate dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, potentially as a compensatory response to glucose deficiency. Altered levels of mandelic acid, glutaric acid, tricarballylic acid, and decan-2-ol, some of which are derived from corn-based diets, also indicate changes in the pulmonary microbiome. Overall, the deletion of CysLTR1 significantly disrupts pulmonary metabolic homeostasis, affecting the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleotides, and microbial-derived metabolites.

Approximately 25% decrease in the spine density was observed in hippocampal CA1 region by going from 3 month-old (3m; young adult) to 24 month-old (24m; aged). We found a significant age-induced decrease in hippocampal neuro-androgen levels by going from 3m to 24 m using mass-spectrometric analysis. The hippocampal levels of testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) dramatically decreased from 17 nM T and 7 nM DHT at 3 m to 17/100 nM T and 7/15 nM DHT at 24 m. On the other hand, hippocampal estradiol (E2) was moderately decreased with aging, from 8 nM at 3 m to 2 nM at 24m. Comprehensive analysis of mRNAs of hippocampal steroidogenic enzymes and receptors showed an age-dependent decrease in their expression levels by approximately 50% (P450(17alpha)), 25% (17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) and 0% (5-reductase and P450arom). Androgen receptor AR was moderately decreased but estrogen receptor ER was not decreased with aging. The 25% decrease in the spine density with aging may be due to a balance between considerably decreased T and DHT levels (spine decrease factor) and remained moderately high E2 level (spine increase factor) in the 24m hippocampus. Aged hippocampus still has moderate capacity of sex-steroid synthesis and their functions. Interestingly, DHT-supplementation and T-supplementation recovered the spine density at 24m.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}

P.; Sun, H.; Carbonetto, P.; Liu, A.; De Jager, P.; Bennet, D.; The Alzheimer's Disease Functional Genomics Consortium,  ; Wang, G.; Stephens, M.", "abstract": "Molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies seek to identify the causal variants affecting molecular traits like DNA methylation and histone modifications. However, existing fine-mapping tools are not well suited to molecular traits, and so molecular QTL analyses typically proceed by considering each variant and each molecular measurement independently, ignoring the LD among variants and the spatial correlation in effects between nearby sites. This severely limits accuracy in identifying causal variants and quantifying their molecular trait effects. Here, we introduce fSuSiE (``functional Sum of Single Effects''), a fine-mapping method that addresses these challenges by explicitly modeling the spatial structure of genetic effects on molecular traits. fSuSiE integrates wavelet-based functional regression with the computationally efficient ``Sum of Single Effects'' framework to simultaneously finemap causal variants and identify the molecular traits they affect. In simulations, fSuSiE identified causal variants and affected CpGs more accurately than methods that ignore spatial structure. In applications to DNA methylation and histone acetylation (H3K9ac) data from the ROSMAP study of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fSuSiE achieved dramatically higher resolution than existing methods (e.g., identifying 6,355 single-variant methylation credible sets compared to only 328 from an existing approach). Applied to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk loci, fSuSiE identified potential causal variants colocalizing with AD GWAS signals for established genes, including CASS4 and CR1/CR2, suggesting specific potential regulatory mechanisms underlying these AD risk loci.", "date": "2025-08-17", "journal": ""}
