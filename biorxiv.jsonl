J.; Shlizerman, E.", "abstract": "The ability to fully discern how the brain orchestrates behavior requires the development of successful computational approaches to integrate and inform in-vivo investigations of the nervous system. To effectively assist with such investigations, computational approaches must be generic, scalable and unbiased. We propose such a comprehensive framework to investigate the interaction between the nervous system and the body for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Specifically, we introduce a model that computationally emulates the activity of the complete somatic nervous system and its response to stimuli. The model builds upon the full anatomical wiring diagram, the connectome, and integrates it with additional layers including intra-cellular and extra-cellular bio-physically relevant neural dynamics, layers translating neural activity to muscle forces and muscle impulses to body postures. In addition, it implements inverse integration which modulates neural dynamics according to external forces on the body. We validate the model by in-silico injection of currents into sensory- and inter-neurons known to play a role in locomotion behaviors (e.g. posterior/anterior touch) and by applying external forces on the body. We are able to generate characteristic baseline locomotion behaviors (forward and backward movements). Inclusion of proprioceptive feedback, implemented through inverse integration, shows that feedback can entrain and sustain movements initiated by neural or mechanical triggers. We further apply neural stimuli, experimentally known to modulate locomotion, and show that our model supports natural behavioral responses such as turns, reversals and avoidance. The proposed model can be utilized to infer neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behavior. For this purpose, we develop large-scale computational ablation approaches such as (i) ablation survey and (ii) conditional ablation. Our results show how an ablation survey can identify neurons required for a ventral turning behavior. We also show how conditional ablation can identify alternative novel neural pathways, e.g. propose neurons which facilitate steering behavior towards olfactory attractants. The outcomes of our study show that the framework can be utilized to identify neural circuits, which control, mediate and generate natural behavior.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Prophages often influence bacterial traits; however, the influence of prophages on the gut microbiota-host immune axis in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the influence of the prophage SfPat on Shewanella fidelis 3313, a persistent member of the gut microbiome of the model marine tunicate, Ciona robusta. Establishment of a SfPat deletion mutant ({Delta}SfPat) reveals the influence of this prophage on bacterial physiology in vitro and during colonization of the Ciona gut. In vitro, deletion of SfPat reduces S. fidelis 3313 motility and swimming while increasing biofilm formation. To understand the in vivo impact of these prophage-induced changes in bacterial traits, we exposed metamorphic stage 4 Ciona juveniles to wildtype (WT) and {Delta}SfPat strains. During colonization, {Delta}SfPat localizes to overlapping and distinct areas of the gut compared to the WT strain. We examined the differential expression of various regulators of cyclic-di-GMP, a secondary signaling molecule that mediates biofilm formation and motility. The pdeB gene, which encodes a bacterial phosphodiesterase known to influence biofilm formation and motility by degrading cyclic-di-GMP, is upregulated in the WT strain but not in {Delta}SfPat when examined in vivo. Expression of the Ciona gut immune effector, VCBP-C, is enhanced during colonization by {Delta}SfPat compared to the WT strain; however, VCBP-C binding to the WT strain does not promote the excision of SfPat in an SOS-dependent pathway. Instead, VCBP-C binding significantly reduces the expression of a phage major capsid protein. Our findings suggest that SfPat influences host perception of this important colonizing commensal and highlights the significance of investigating tripartite dynamics between prophages, bacteria, and their animal hosts to better understand the gut microbiota-host immune axis.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

In general, one observes a large variability in such studies, which reduces the confidence one can have in such models. It is important to understand the causes of this variability as a first step toward reducing it. For a given data set, the variability in a multi-model study can arise from uncertainty in structure or in parameter values for a given structure. Previous studies have made assumptions about the origin of parameter uncertainty, and then quantified its contribution, generally finding that parameter uncertainty is less important than structure uncertainty. However, those studies do not take account of the full parameter variability in multi-model studies. Here we propose estimating parameter uncertainty based on open-call multi-model ensembles where the same structure is used by more than one modeling group. The variability in such a case is due to the full variability of parameters among modeling groups. Then structure and parameter contributions can be estimated sing random effects analysis of variance. Based on three multi-model studies for simulating wheat phenology, it is found that the contribution of parameter uncertainty to total uncertainty is, on average, more than twice as large as the uncertainty from structure. A second estimate, based on a comparison of two different calibration approaches for multiple models leads to a very similar result. We conclude that improvement of crop models requires as much attention to parameters as to model structure.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Despite some studies challenging the link between temporal compression and intentional action, intentional binding is still widely used as an implicit measure for the sense of agency. The debate remains unsettled primarily because the experimental conditions used in previous studies were confounded with various alternative causes for temporal compression, and action intention has not yet been tested comprehensively against all potential alternative causes in a single study. Here, we solve this puzzle by jointly comparing participants' estimates of the interval between three types of triggering events with comparable predictability - voluntary movement, passive movement, and external sensory event - and an external sensory outcome (auditory or visual across experiments). The results failed to show intentional binding, i.e., no shorter interval estimation for the voluntary than the passive movement conditions. Instead, we observed temporal (but not intentional) binding when comparing both movement conditions with the external sensory condition. Thus, temporal binding appears to originate from sensory integration and temporal prediction, not from action intention. As such, these findings underscore the need to reconsider the use of intentional binding as a reliable proxy of the sense of agency.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Previous joint S-F studies of perisylvian development were mainly conducted on individual structural and functional metrics. By employing a weighted combination of metrics, joint S-F studies can enhance the understanding of perisylvian development in neonates, thereby providing valuable features for the prediction of neurodevelopmental disorders. To this end, we employed both structural and functional metrics derived from perisylvian sub-regions (PSRs). Structural metrics included morphological and myelination measures, while functional metrics encompassed functional connectivity (FC) values between a designated seed PSR and the remaining PSRs. In addition, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) for all PSRs was computed and used as a distinct group of functional metrics. During statistical procedure, based on sparse canonical correlation analysis (CCA), the structural metrics were correlated with each respective group of functional metrics. Then, CCA was employed to delineate regional interdependencies and derive combined structural-functional features. The findings revealed that combined features outperform individual metrics for characterizing the normal development of the PSRs in term neonates. The myelination is prominently related to both fALFF and FCs, while morphological metrics of the PSRs have very limited contribution in combined structural features. Among the designated PSRs, the FCs of both the right insula and Heschl's gyrus with other PSRs demonstrated a more robust correlation with the combined structural features.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we used mesoscale two-photon microscopy and whole-cell electrophysiology to examine whether striatal output during early postnatal development impacts the activity and maturation of upstream dmPFC circuits. We found that ablating spiny projection neurons of the direct or indirect pathways of the striatum during the first two postnatal weeks causes bidirectional changes in dmPFC neural activity, similar to observations in mature circuits. In addition, these manipulations alter the maturation of synaptic connectivity of dmPFC layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, shifting the balance of excitation and inhibition of cortical circuits.

As has also been observed for the pandemic lineage of V. cholerae, the emergence of the clone involved the acquisition of multiple marker genes and genomic islands within a short timeframe (~60 years), followed by divergence into distinct, successive sublineages mediating independent waves of cross-country transmission. In V. parahaemolyticus, a recent wave succession event within the last two decades has been driven by gene-loss in the putrescine utilization (Puu) pathway, which confers phenotypic advantages related to environmental adaptation (enhanced biofilms) and human transmission (increased cell adhesion and intestinal colonization, reduced virulence in an animal model and milder clinical symptoms in humans), aligning with the trade-off hypothesis of pathogen virulence evolution. We identify similar lineage-specific Puu-gene-loss across multiple bacterial genera, with effects on biofilm and adhesion replicated in V. cholerae and Escherichia coli, suggesting convergent evolution and universal phenotypic effects across bacteria.

Past reports have elucidated that many strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus which cause Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND) in shrimp harbor two functional T6SSs (T6SS1 and T6SS2), leading to speculation about the contribution of these systems to disease progression. In the present study, we confirm the antibacterial functionality of T6SS1 and T6SS2 in the representative AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) strain 13-306/D4. Employing a small-scale shrimp infection model, we then demonstrate that T6SS1 enhances the lethality of this isolate against whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) postlarvae under warm, marine-like conditions. We additionally describe a novel antibacterial toxin/immunity pair encoded on pVA-like plasmids that features a putative colicin/bacteriocin effector domain.

In the EfN experiment, one falsely believes that a set of observations contains noisy, shifted copies of a template signal (e.g., an Einstein image), whereas in reality, it contains only pure noise observations. To estimate the signal, the observations are first aligned with the template using cross-correlation, and then averaged. Although the observations contain nothing but noise, it was recognized early on that this process produces a signal that resembles the template signal! This pitfall was at the heart of a central scientific controversy about validation techniques in structural biology. This paper provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of the EfN phenomenon above. We show that the Fourier phases of the EfN estimator (namely, the average of the aligned noise observations) converge to the Fourier phases of the template signal, explaining the observed structural similarity. Additionally, we prove that the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the number of noise observations and, in the high-dimensional regime, to the Fourier magnitudes of the template signal. Moreover, in the high-dimensional regime, the Fourier magnitudes converge to a scaled version of the template signal's Fourier magnitudes. This work not only deepens the theoretical understanding of the EfN phenomenon but also highlights potential pitfalls in template matching techniques and emphasizes the need for careful interpretation of noisy observations across disciplines in engineering, statistics, physics, and biology.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Using rheology and confocal reflectance microscopy, we investigate the gelation of collagen I hydrogels formed in the presence of EVs, and show that EVs can play an active role in ECM formation. EVs appear to nucleate new fibrils, recruiting collagen molecules from solution and accelerating their polymerization. Trypsinization of EVs shows that collagen-EV interactions are primarily mediated by surface proteins. The use of extruded plasma membrane vesicles shows that membrane composition determines final fibril length and matrix structure. EVs also become integrated into the fibril structures that they help form, reminiscent of matrix vesicles found in situ within tissues. This represents a plausible way by which EVs are deposited into the ECM, becoming signaling cues for resident cells.

Social behaviors are translationally relevant, considering both mice and humans are highly social mammals, and human social behavior disruptions are key symptoms of myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. Stresses related to social experiences are particularly influential in the severity and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders like anxiety disorders, and trauma and stressor-related disorders. Yet, induction and study of social stress in mice has disproportionately focused on males, influenced heavily by their inherent territorial nature. Conspecific-instigated stress (i.e., defeat), while ethologically relevant, is quite variable and predominantly specific to males, making rigorous and sex-inclusive studies challenging. In pursuit of a controllable, consistent, high throughput, and sex-inclusive method for social stress elicitation, we modified a paradigm to train male and female F1 129S1/SvlmJ x C57BL/6J mice to associate (via classical conditioning) same or different sex C57BL/6J conspecifics with a mild, aversive stimulus. While further paradigm optimization is required, social interaction testing 24 h after conditioning indicates males socially conditioned better to male conspecifics by exhibiting reduced social interaction, whereas females socially conditioned better to male conspecifics. Serum corticosterone levels inversely corresponded to social avoidance after different sex, but not same sex, conditioning, suggesting corticosterone-mediated arousal influences cross sex interactions.

To do so, we project patients' fMRI data into a low-dimension latent-space. We define the latent space's dimension as the smallest dimension able to maintain the complexity, non-linearities, and information carried by the data, according to different criteria that we detail in the first part. This dimensionality reduction procedure then allows us to build biologically inspired latent whole-brain models that can be calibrated at the single-patient level. In particular, we propose a new model inspired by the regulation of neuronal activity by astrocytes in the brain. This modeling procedure leads to two types of model-based biomarkers (MBBs) that provide novel insight at different levels: (1) the connectivity matrices bring us information about the severity of the patient's diagnosis, and, (2) the local node parameters correlate to the patient's etiology, age and prognosis.

Using a semi-supervised learning strategy, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on pollen images of 60 widely distributed grass species and unlabeled fossil Poaceae. Semi-supervised learning improved the CNN models' capability to generalize feature recognition in fossil pollen specimens. Our models successfully captured both the taxonomic diversity of an assemblage and morphological differences between C3 and C4 species. We applied our trained models to fossil grass pollen assemblages from a 25,000-year lake-sediment record from eastern equatorial Africa and correlated past shifts in grass diversity with atmospheric CO2 concentration and proxy records of local temperature, precipitation, and fire occurrence. We quantified grass diversity for each time window using morphological variability, calculating both Shannon entropy and morphotype counts from the specimens' CNN features. Reconstructed C3:C4 ratios suggest a gradual increase in C4 grasses with rising temperature and fire activity across the late-glacial to Holocene transition.

GBA mutations are together an important genetic risk factor for PD and are associated with a decrease in glucocerebrosidase, a lysosomal glycoprotein encoded by GBA, increase in alpha-synuclein and changes in sphingolipids levels and composition. However, the extent of lipid metabolism disruptions associated to PD and their contributions to disease progression remain unclear. In this study, we used a combination of biochemical and lipidomic analyses of amygdala from healthy controls (HC) and people with sporadic (sPD) or GBA-associated PD (PD-GBA) to investigate the correlation between alpha-synuclein, glucocerebrosidase and lipids. We found extensive metabolic remodelling of brain lipids, including increased free cholesterol, diacylglycerides, sphingolipids and specific glycerophospholipids in amygdala from people with sPD and disease duration above 30 years (sPD>30y) and from people with PD carriers of a GBA risk mutation (PD-GBArisk) relative to HC. The levels of free cholesterol, diacylglycerides, sphingolipids and specific glycerophospholipids all correlated positively with pathological S and negatively with GCase activity. In contrast, the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin only correlated positively with GCase activity. Moreover, we observed changes in the distribution of species for sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids in opposite directions for two categories of PD cases. We found a shift from short to long sphingomyelin and ceramide and from long to short phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in sPD>30y and PD-GBArisk cases and the opposite in sPD<10y and PD-GBAsevere cases. The relative proportion of lipid species affected in these samples all correlated with glucocerebrosidase activity and pathological alpha-synuclein levels. Together, these findings highlight the correlation between glucocerebrosidase, pathological alpha-synuclein and lipid levels in PD.

We imaged calcium activity from single neurons in OFC or M2 during de novo learning of increasingly uncertain reward probability schedules. Predictions of choice were decoded from M2 neurons with high accuracy under all certainty conditions, but were more accurately decoded from OFC neurons under greater uncertainty. The number of choice- and reward-selective neurons was significantly higher in M2 than in OFC across schedules, but these proportions increased across levels of uncertainty only in OFC. Decoding accuracy of choice and outcome was predicted by behavioral strategies Win-Stay and Lose-Shift in OFC, but not M2. We also tested causal involvement of these regions with chemogenetic perturbation as rats learned increasing and then decreasing uncertainty schedules. Whereas inhibition of OFC neurons attenuated learning across all schedules, M2 neurons were found to support learning in the most certain reward schedule. Thus, OFC neurons preferentially encode choices and outcomes that foster a greater reliance on adaptive strategies under uncertainty. This reveals a novel functional heterogeneity within frontal cortex in support of flexible learning.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Our understanding of the metabolic processes that fuel kidney functions is limited by the kidney's structural and functional heterogeneity. As the kidney contains many different cell types, we sought to determine the intra-renal mitochondrial heterogeneity that contributes to cell-specific metabolism. To interrogate this, we utilized a recently developed mitochondrial tagging technique to isolate kidney cell-type specific mitochondria. Here, we investigate mitochondrial functional capacities and the metabolomes of the early and late proximal tubule (PT) and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The conditional MITO-Tag transgene was combined with Slc34a1-CreERT2, Ggt1-Cre, or Pvalb-Cre transgenes to generate mouse models capable of cell-specific isolation of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mitochondria from the early PT, late PT, or the DCT, respectively. Functional assays measuring mitochondrial respiratory and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) capacities and metabolomics were performed on anti-HA immunoprecipitated mitochondria from kidneys of ad libitum fed and 24-hour fasted male mice. The renal MITO-Tag models targeting the early PT, late PT, and DCT revealed differential mitochondrial respiratory and FAO capacities which dynamically changed during fasting conditions.

In Protein-SIP, peptides and corresponding taxa are identified by database matching, making database quality crucial for accurate analyses. For samples with unknown community composition, Protein-SIP typically employs either unrestricted reference databases or metagenome-derived databases. While (meta)genome-derived databases represent the gold standard, they may be incomplete and are typically resource-intensive to generate. In contrast, unrestricted reference databases can inflate the search space and require complex post-processing. Results: Here, we explore the feasibility of using de novo peptide sequencing to construct peptide databases directly from mass spectrometry raw data. We then use the mass spectrometric data from labeled cultures to quantify isotope incorporation into specific peptides. We benchmark our approach against the canonical approach in which a sample-matching (meta)genome-derived protein sequence database is used on three different datasets: 1) a proteome analysis from a defined microbial community containing 13C-labeled E. coli cells, 2) time-course data of an anammox-dominated continuous reactor after feeding with 13C-labeled bicarbonate, and 3) a model of the human distal gut simulating a high-protein and high-fiber diet cultivated in either 2H2O or H218O. Our results show that de novo peptide databases are applicable to different isotopes, detecting similar amounts of labeled peptides compared to sample-matching (meta)genome-derived databases, and also identify labeled peptides missed by this canonical approach. Furthermore, we show that peptide-centric Protein-SIP allows up to species-specific resolution and enables the assessment of activity related to individual biological processes. Finally, we provide access to our modular Python pipeline to assist the construction of de novo peptide databases and subsequent peptide-centric Protein-SIP data analysis (https://git.ufz.de/meb/denovo-sip). Conclusions: De novo peptide databases enable Protein-SIP of microbial communities without prior knowledge of the composition and can be used complementarily to (meta)genome-derived databases or as a standalone alternative in exploratory or resource-limited settings.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Its wound healing, skin improvement, and neuroprotective properties have been widely studied. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by cells and contain bioactive components with therapeutic properties. Objectives: This study aims to characterize EVs isolated from C. asiatica tissue culture and investigate their therapeutic properties using in-vitro assays and UVB-induced damage mouse model. Methods: EVs were isolated from C. asiatica tissue culture and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cytotoxicity, anti-oxidation, anti-melanin, and anti-inflammation of the EVs were evaluated by MTT assay, tyrosinase assay and RT-qPCR in chemical or in vitro assays. A UVB-induced photodamage mouse model was established to assess the anti-inflammation effect of EVs in vivo. Gels with or without EVs were applied to the damage site and skin appearance was observed daily and skin histopathology was analyzed on day 7 by H&E and immunohistochemical staining. Results: C. asiatica EVs were found to contain high levels of polyphenol and mitigated hydrogen peroxide-induced intracellular ROS. The EVs were further able to reduce intracellular melanin content and tyrosinase activity, and exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating expression of pro-inflammatory genes COX2 as well as nitric oxide production. In mice with UVB-induced skin damage, daily application of C. asiatica EV gel reduced skin epidermis thickness and inflammation compared to UVB-only or blank gel at seven days after UV irradiation. Conclusions: The beneficial effects of C. asiatica EVs on skin quality warrant further studies as promising agents in skin care applications.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

We then identified 19,432 age-associated CpGs (aaCpGs) that were strongly correlated with age and showed high consistency between sexes, with faster methylation changes observed in males. Most aaCpGs were identified during early and late life stages, indicating accelerated epigenetic changes during development and aging. No specific genomic enrichment was observed. Clustering analysis revealed four distinct, non-linear age-related methylation trajectories. These findings underscore the complexity of epigenetic aging and suggest that current clocks may overlook important dynamic patterns, particularly after age 65.

RABV gene expression was shaped by host cell type. RABV induced small-scale, cell-type conserved transcriptional programs that likely support infection by 1) hijacking negative transcriptional feedback of pro-viral factors while 2) reducing anti-viral RNAs. Unexpectedly, disinhibited innate immune signaling increased RABV transcription, most strikingly in an infection-independent 'pro-viral' astrocyte subpopulation.

To investigate the contribution of FGL1 to liver diseases, we compared wild-type mice to mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Fgl1 subjected to a steatosis or HCC experimental protocol. We found that mice deficient for Fgl1 in hepatocytes showed higher levels of plasma glucose, pronounced metabolic alterations and liver injury when fed a western diet compared to their wild-type counterparts. However, both genotypes exhibited a similar lipid deposition in the liver. Similarly, wild type and Fgl1-deficient mice displayed comparable liver alterations during HCC progression.

The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide the first evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses.

The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 regulates these processes in the intestines of mice and humans; the anti-inflammatory activity of IL10 is also conserved in birds. To determine the function of IL10 in avian mucosal immunity, we generated germ line modifications of the chicken IL10 locus to abolish or reduce IL10 expression. In vitro analysis of macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide confirmed the loss of IL10 protein expression, the lack of dosage compensation in heterozygotes, and prevention of autocrine inhibition of nitric oxide production in homozygous IL10 knockout macrophages. IL10-deficiency significantly altered the composition of the caecal microbiome, but unlike IL10-deficient mice and humans, IL10-deficient chickens did not exhibit spontaneous colitis. Following experimental challenge with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium or Campylobacter jejuni in IL10-deficient chickens, enhanced clearance of the pathogens was associated with elevated transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells into gut mucosa. In IL10-deficient chickens challenged with the parasite Eimeria tenella, pathogen clearance was accelerated but caecal lesions were more severe and weight gain was compromised. Neither the heterozygous IL10 knockout nor a homozygous IL10 enhancer mutation had a major effect on pathogen clearance or inflammation in any of the challenge models.

We showed that prophage {varphi}13 is lost in approximately half the bacterial population during the course of infection. Inactivation of the {varphi}13 int recombinase gene, essential for insertion/excision, locked the prophage in the bacterial chromosome, leading to a significant loss of virulence in a murine systemic infection model.

Accordingly, histopathological analyses revealed more severe nephritis in mice infected with bacteria lacking prophage {varphi}13 ({Delta}{varphi}13), in contrast to infection compared to infection with the parental strain. Infection with the {Delta}int mutant, where beta-hemolysin production is abolished, led to the least severe renal lesions.

T.; Svensson, E. I.", "abstract": "Sexual conflict over mating has been documented in many species, both in the field and in experimental studies. In pond damselflies (family Coenagrionidae), sexual conflict maintains female-limited colour polymorphisms, with one female morph typically being a male mimic. However, it is not known whether sexual conflict can also explain the evolutionary origin of novel female morphs, and if so, what ecological factors play a role in this macroevolutionary transition, by modulating the strength of the conflict. Furthermore, the effects of sexual conflict on phylogenetic diversification remain controversial, with studies arguing that the evolution of alternative reproductive morphs, such as female-limited colour morphs, could either hinder or accelerate speciation. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to show that female colour polymorphisms are more likely to evolve when population densities at breeding sites are high, and that these demographic conditions are more common at high latitudes and in open landscapes. We show that female-limited polymorphisms typically evolve from sexually dimorphic ancestors through the addition of a male-like female morph, consistent with the hypothesis of selection for male mimicry. Female polymorphic and sexually dimorphic lineages diversify at a higher rate than sexually monomorphic lineages, suggesting a broad diversity-promoting role of inter-sexual interactions based on visual signals. We conclude that female colour polymorphisms evolve in a predictable fashion, and are likely driven by ecological conditions that increase the rate of pre-mating interactions and thus the intensity of sexual conflict.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

To investigate this distinction, we used visual and semantic representational analysis of fMRI data from 60 participants viewing everyday objects in multiple task contexts, and we examined the relationships between regions in terms of information coding. We demonstrate that coding of visual content in the occipital lobe is overwhelmingly modular, such that different occipital structures show limited coordination and tend to encode information redundantly. By contrast, the coding of semantic content in the inferior temporal lobe involves a high degree of coordination between regions, which optimize their coding to collectively represent a large semantic space with minimal redundancy between regions. No other brain area - neither the parietal nor prefrontal cortices - shows the preference for large-scale coding seen in the inferior temporal lobe.

These analyses have led us to conclude that the COX6B1 subunit does not only contribute to the stabilization of cIV in the late assembly stages, but is also indispensable for redox-sensitive early cIV assembly steps. In addition, this study has evidenced the incorporation of partially assembled cIV modules directly into supercomplex structures, supporting the \"cooperative assembly\" model for respiratory chain biogenesis.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The adult visual system is characterised by high-resolution foveal vision and a peripheral field limited by crowding, the disruption to object recognition in clutter that gives a summary 'gist' over fine detail. In children, crowding is elevated foveally, with the estimated age where foveal crowding drops to adult-like levels varying widely from 5 to 12+ years. As crowding restricts key processes like reading, characterisation of this developmental trajectory is critical. Using methods optimised to measure crowding in children, adults and typically-developing children (n=119; 3-13 years) judged the orientation of a foveal 'VacMan' target either in isolation or surrounded by 'ghost' flankers. For isolated elements, acuity (measured as gap-size thresholds) dropped rapidly to adult-like levels at 5-6 years. Thresholds rose when flanked/crowded, with elevations highest at 3-4 years, persisting at 5-6 years, and dropping to adult-like levels at 7-8 years. A meta-analysis of our results with 11 prior studies reveals a consistent developmental trajectory, despite wide methodological variations. We further demonstrate that developmental crowding shows the same selectivity for target-flanker similarity as peripheral crowding, consistent with common mechanisms. This prolonged development reveals a shifting balance in the visual system between the processing of fine detail vs. the 'gist' of the scene.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Notably, these changes are associated with spatial proximity to another mouse rather than active social contact. Interestingly, a network analysis of syllable transitions shows that context-sensitive syllables exhibit altered network influence, independent of the number of connected syllables, suggesting a regulatory role. Furthermore, syllable composition changes significantly during social contact events with two distinct sequence families governing approach and withdrawal behaviors. However, no unique syllable sequences mapped to specific social interactions.\n\nOverall, our findings suggest that a subset of syllables drives contextual behavioral adaptation in mice, potentially fascilitating transitions within the broader behavioral repertoire.

Here, we use diverse approaches to reveal that PV disrupts cellular redox homeostasis and directly activates SRC family tyrosine kinases via oxidation of specific cysteine residues. Using mass spectrometry and biophysical approaches, we show that oxidation activates SRC by disrupting autoinhibition and altering phosphopeptide binding by its SH2 domain. We further establish that redox-sensitive cysteine residues are essential for SRC to promote cellular overgrowth.

In chronic infections or cancers, lasting antigen exposure leads to permanent PDCD1 expression that can limit immune-mediated clearance of pathogens or degenerated cells. Consequently, blocking PDCD1 can enhance T cell function, which is the basis of cancer immune checkpoint therapy. We found that PDCD1 expression can increase within hours of temperature elevation in human leukemic and lymphoblastoid cell lines (such as Jurkat, THP1, HL-60, GM07062, and NK-92) and mouse lymphoid organs (e.g., thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes). Transcriptional upregulation of the PDCD1 gene was associated with the binding of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to the promoter, and HSF1 knockout in HL-60 cells resulted in reduced PDCD1 activation. Furthermore, a heat shock-dependent increase in glycosylated (and therefore active) PDCD1 protein levels was associated with PDCD1 exposure on the cell membrane and a reduction in the cytotoxic properties of NK-92 cells. Our observations suggest that the immune response could be attenuated in various physiological conditions accompanied by increased temperatures (infection, heat stroke, etc.).

It is unclear how hallucinatory proneness changes across the lifespan, with prior questionnaire-based studies showing mixed results. As factors such as multi-sensory acuity loss and relatively increased reliance on prior knowledge may increase as we age, and these are considered risk factors for hallucination proneness, we hypothesised that reported decreases in hallucinations might reflect stigma-related underreporting. We therefore sought to measure hallucination proneness in 44 healthy adults spanning the adult lifespan (younger age group; n=22; age 19-39 years, mean: 27.2, SD: 5.5; older age group n=22; age 59-79 years, mean: 68.0, SD: 5.8), quantifying the tendency to experience complex and simple hallucinations in an experimental environment designed to elicit hallucinations. We find that reports of complex hallucinations (those representing objects, scenes, etc) are lower in older adults than in younger adults, both in real time and retrospectively. None of our measured cognitive or sensory measures (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, perceptual reorganisation, imagery vividness, memory inhibition, and suggestibility) mediate this relationship. We conclude that reduced complex hallucination proneness appears normative in ageing, and that experiencing hallucinations in older individuals may signal underlying pathology.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

To identify leukemia molecular pathways that drive resistance, we analyzed whole exome and targeted mutation panel sequencing in two independent cohorts of DLI-treated patients, nominating oncogenic, truncating mutations in ASXL1(ASXL1MUT) as the genetic basis for DLI resistance. Deep interrogation of 138,152 bone marrow single myeloid cell transcriptomes (scRNA-seq) from this cohort linked DLI resistance to a transcriptional state notable for leukemic stem cell identity and HLA-I suppression. In silico analysis of publicly available scRNA- and ATAC-seq data in acute myeloid and chronic myelomonocytic leukemias, respectively, confirmed an association between ASXL1MUT and HLA-I suppression across myeloid malignancies. CRISPR correction of the endogenous ASXL1MUT in the K562 leukemic cell line increased HLA-I, but not HLA-II, surface protein expression through increased deposition of the activating H3K4Me3 mark with only modest effect on the repressive H3K27Me3 mark, suggesting a Polycomb-independent mechanism of action. Indeed, inhibitors of EZH2, a critical component of the PRC2 complex, significantly upregulated HLA-I surface protein expression independently of ASXL1MUT, suggesting that EZH2 inhibition could bypass ASXL1MUT-mediated HLA-1 suppression. Importantly, ASXL1CORRECTION significantly increased CD8+ T cell recognition, activation and killing, and ASXL1MUT-mediated T cell suppression could be overcome by EZH2 inhibition. Thus, by integrating molecular analyses with immuno-functional studies, we define a novel oncogene-driven pathway of immune evasion and propose a therapeutic strategy to re-engage T cell killing in ASXL1MUT tumors.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

S.; Adcock, A.; Gritsenko, V.", "abstract": "Upper limb motor deficits are common after stroke and often persist despite rehabilitation. While clinical assessments emphasize movement quality, they do not capture the underlying neuromuscular impairments, particularly in individuals with mild deficits. This study aimed to characterize stroke-related changes in muscle recruitment during reaching by separating tonic (gravity-compensating) and phasic (intersegmental dynamics-related) components of EMG activity. We recorded surface EMG from 12 upper limb muscles during goal-directed reaching in 8 individuals with unilateral ischemic stroke and 9 controls. Using principal component analysis, we extracted tonic and phasic components and compared their amplitude, directional tuning, and coactivation patterns across groups. Group differences were evaluated with generalized linear mixed-effects models, regression, and correlation analyses. Even individuals with mild stroke exhibited abnormal muscle recruitment. Proximal muscles were over-recruited in directions that typically require less activation, indicating altered directional tuning. Phasic activation of distal muscles was significantly reduced and worsened with time post-stroke (R2 = 0.52, p = 0.002). Tonic overactivation of proximal muscles was present across all stroke participants. Muscle coactivation patterns were hemisphere-specific: right-hemisphere stroke reduced tonic coactivation in contralateral arms, whereas left-hemisphere stroke increased it. Abnormal phasic coactivation between proximal and distal muscles correlated with impaired intersegmental dynamics compensation (R2 = 0.67, p = 0.013). Tonic and phasic impairments were often correlated, suggesting shared disruption of corticospinal and reticulospinal pathways. These findings reveal distinct yet interacting deficits in muscle recruitment following stroke, supporting the development of neuromechanically-informed tools for individualized rehabilitation.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

This raises the question whether engrams underlying human episodic memories also persist despite forgetting? And do forgotten memories influence human behavior implicitly? To address this question, 40 men and women learned 96 face-object pairs. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla we mapped the fate of the 96 memories at the systems level from learning to a 30-minute and onward to a 24-hour memory test. Upon each retrieval attempt, participants indicated whether they remembered or forgot the memory. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the functional brain data revealed that the engrams of forgotten memories remain implemented in the episodic memory network and continue to influence the accuracy of guessing responses at test. Overnight, the engrams of forgotten memories became implemented more deeply within bilateral hippocampus, while consciously accessible memories were neocorticalized overnight. The engrams of both consciously accessible and inaccessible (forgotten) memories were shifted from the 30-minute to the 24-hour retrieval within the right hippocampus and anterior cingulate gyrus such that pattern dissimilarities supported the correct retrieval responses at 24 hours.

In this study, we explored whether a novel approach to UAV-based acoustic monitoring could detect biodiversity patterns across a varied tropical landscape in Costa Rica. We simulated surveys of UAVs employing intermittent locomotion-based sampling strategies on an existing dataset of 26,411 hours of audio recorded from 341 static sites, with automated detections of 19 bird species (n = 1,819) and spider monkey (n = 2,977) vocalisations. We varied the number of samplers deployed in a single survey (sampling intensity) and whether the samplers move between sites randomly, in a pre-determined route to minimise travel time, or by adaptively responding to real-time detections (sampling strategy) and measured the impact on downstream ecological analyses. We found that observed avian species richness and spider monkey occupancy was not impacted by sampling strategy, but that sampling intensity had a strong influence on downstream metrics. Whilst our simulated UAV surveys were effective in capturing broad biodiversity trends, such as spider monkey occupancy and avian habitat associations, they were less suited for exhaustive species inventories, with rare species often missed at low sampling intensities.

In particular, the feedback inhibitor CITED2 operates a unidirectional switch that efficiently terminates the hypoxic response by displacing the C-terminal activation domain of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 from its complex with the TAZ1 domain of the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. Unidirectionality of the switch arises from subtle allosteric conformational changes in TAZ1 and from differences in the strength of thermodynamic coupling between the TAZ1-binding motifs in the multivalent HIF-1 and CITED2 activation domains. To investigate the role of binding cooperativity, we mutated a linker sequence in the HIF-1 activation domain to enhance or reduce the thermodynamic coupling between its TAZ1-binding motifs. An efficient native-gel assay shows that certain linker mutations enhance the affinity of HIF-1 for TAZ1, and fluorescence anisotropy competition and NMR measurements show that these mutants can compete with CITED2 for TAZ1 more effectively than wild-type HIF-1. The wide range of mutants, which include insertion, deletion, replacement and scrambling of residues in the linker, provide insights into the molecular basis for the exquisite tuning of the hypoxic switch: the TAZ1 affinity and consequent CITED2 competition enhancement depends both on the flexibility of the linker sequence (particularly the presence of glycine residues) and the unfavorable electrostatic interactions of a highly conserved arginine side chain in the center of the linker with an electropositive surface of TAZ1.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Within cell-type neuronal electrophysiological, morphological, and transcriptomic heterogeneity is the norm in the brain. Although generally considered a fixed property within cell-types, this heterogeneity is malleable and declines in regions of the human brain that generate seizures. Building off this foundational work we hypothesize that such plasticity of cell-type heterogeneity, specifically its decline, arises from the shared history of neuronal activity that drive intrinsic plasticity mechanisms in a concerted fashion. To explore this hypothesis we study neuronal activity in two model systems: human cortical slice cultures from patients with epilepsy as well as slices from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and subiculum of rodent kainic acid (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Biophysical properties and spiking dynamics were characterized using whole-cell patch clamp recordings of layer 2 and layer 3 (L2&3) pyramidal neurons in human slice culture as well as deep layer subicular neurons and layer 5 (L5) mPFC of KA mice. We found a significant decline in biophysical heterogeneity and a reduction in information coding in both the KA and slice culture models. In both these models we found a consistent increase in hyperpolarization activated cation current (HCN) dependent electrophysiological properties, the blockade of which restored electrophysiological heterogeneity and information coding. Our findings demonstrate that within cell-type heterogeneity is malleable, and despite being a complex distributed network property, can be tuned by a single ionic current. These findings emphasize the plasticity of within cell-type heterogeneity, suggesting the potential for targeted interventions to restore neuronal heterogeneity changes that accompany epilepsy and potentially other neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a multidisciplinary study encompassing structural, biochemical, and cellular approaches to elucidate Siglec-10-carbohydrate interactions and function. X-ray crystallography revealed two key arginine residues within the Siglec-10 binding site that interact with the carboxyl group of sialic acid, a canonical R119 and a non-canonical R127, suggesting potential dual contributions to ligand engagement. Saturation Transfer Difference (STD)-NMR confirmed that R119 is essential for binding to sialoglycans, while R127 appears dispensable in interactions with glycans in solution. However, cell-based binding assays using primary human T cells and engineered monocytic lines demonstrated that both arginines (R119 and R127) are critical for cellular recognition, highlighting a more complex mechanism of interaction with the glycocalyx. We further ruled out CD24 as a principal ligand for Siglec-10 on T cells or breast cancer cells, despite high CD24 expression, suggesting the involvement of alternative sialylated glycoproteins or glycolipids. Finally, we show that antibody-mediated blockade of Siglec-10 using S10A mAb restores CAR-T cell cytotoxicity against Siglec-10 expressing target cells, supporting a role for Siglec-10 as an immune checkpoint.

Dynamic modeling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a powerful framework for understanding and predicting microbiome behaviors. However, developing reliable ODE models is severely hampered by their nonlinear nature and the presence of significant challenges, particularly critical issues related to identifiability. Here, we address the identification problem in dynamic microbial community models by proposing an integrated methodology to tackle key challenges. Focusing on nonlinear ODE-based models, we examine four critical pitfalls: identifiability issues (structural and practical), unstable dynamics (potentially leading to numerical blow-up), underfitting (convergence to suboptimal solutions), and overfitting (fitting noise rather than signal). These pitfalls yield unreliable parameter estimates, unrealistic model behavior, and poor generalization. Our study presents a comprehensive workflow incorporating structural and practical identifiability analysis, robust global optimization for calibration, stability checks, and rigorous predictive power assessment. The methodologys effectiveness and versatility in mitigating these pitfalls are demonstrated through case studies of increasing complexity, paving the way for more reliable and mechanistically insightful models of microbial communities.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer a promising approach for both treatment and prevention. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of 4F11, a highly potent and broadly neutralizing mAb with demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy against HMPV. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we defined a unique mechanism of binding HMPV employed by 4F11, which distinguishes it from previously characterized RSV and HMPV mAbs. 4F11 targets an epitope located at the apex of the prefusion F protein (site O) with a 1:1 stoichiometry, distinct from the 3:1 stoichiometry observed with other HMPV site O antibodies. Unlike other site O antibodies, which penetrate the glycan shield between Asn57 and Asn172, 4F11 binds vertically and directly interacts with the Asn172 glycan, representing a unique glycan-dependent mode of recognition. In vitro, 4F11 displayed high potency and broad neutralization across diverse HMPV strains. It also showed a low propensity for resistance development, with only a single escape mutation (K179E) identified, a mutation not found in any published HMPV sequence to date. Viruses rescued with the K179E escape mutation had significantly decreased fitness in vitro compared to wild-type virus. In a hamster challenge model, 4F11 significantly reduced viral loads in both the lungs and nasal turbinates. These findings highlight 4F11 as a promising candidate for therapeutic development, particularly for immunocompromised individuals and other high-risk groups.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Causality perception, a core example of this inferential process, enables observers to infer cause-effect relationships, such as whether a moving object causes another to move. Traditionally considered a low-level visual computation, causality perception is increasingly recognized as shaped by top-down dynamics, perceptual history, and individual predictive processing styles. Here, we examined how prior experience and cognitive-perceptual traits shape causal inference in 150 neurotypical individuals, using data-driven clustering to stratify participants along the autism-schizotypy (ASD-SSD) spectrum. Participants viewed dynamic collision events in which a moving circle contacted a stationary one, followed by variable temporal lags before the second objects motion, and judged whether the interaction appeared causal or non-causal. Causality judgments were influenced by both physical timing (sensory-driven) and serial dependence on previous perceptual decisions (prior-driven). Hierarchical drift diffusion modeling (HDDM) revealed that SSD-like individuals showed a strong prior bias toward causality, greater serial dependence, and lower decision thresholds, reflecting a prior-dominated perceptual style. Conversely, ASD-like individuals exhibited reduced influence of perceptual history and higher decision thresholds, reflecting a conservative, data-driven style. Crucially, prior bias, serial dependence, and decision-making dynamics were strongly interrelated, revealing a hierarchical structure to perceptual inference across neurocognitive profiles. These findings demonstrate that causality perception emerges from predictive processes operating at multiple timescales and shaped by individual differences in neurocognitive style and perceptual flexibility.\n\nSignificance StatementAccurate causality perception is a fundamental building block of cognition, supporting our ability to parse the sensory world, guide action, and construct coherent models of the environment. It provides a key example of perceptual inference, and thus how the brain integrates sensory input, prior expectations, and recent experience to shape subjective perception.\n\nHere, we show that causality perception is not fixed, but varies systematically across individuals, mirroring broader variability in how different neurocognitive architectures balance sensory evidence and prior expectations along the autism-schizotypy (ASD-SSD) spectrum within the general population. By combining psychophysical data with hierarchical computational modeling, we reveal distinct perceptual inference styles along the autism-schizotypy continuum, ranging from sensory-driven to prior-driven processing.\n\nThese findings advance predictive processing accounts of individual variability and offer new insights into the mechanisms supporting flexible and adaptive perception in neurodiverse populations.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Conversely, during chronic/unmitigated cellular stress the ISR becomes maladaptive and has been implicated in a range of neurodegenerative conditions including Parkinsons Disease (PD). However, the mechanisms by which maladaptive ISR/ATF4 signaling contributes to neurodegeneration have not been elucidated. In this study we establish a critical mechanism by which chronic ISR activation becomes maladaptive and promotes neurodegeneration in neurotoxin and a-synucleinopathy models of PD in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we demonstrate that chronic activation of ATF4, the central transcription factor of the ISR, promotes neurodegeneration by regulating the transcriptional induction of SESN2, DDIT4 and Trib3 that co-operate to suppress both mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATF4-mediated suppression of mTORC1/2 activity promotes dopaminergic neuronal death in PD models by facilitating the activation of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein PUMA. Taken together, we have discovered a novel maladaptive ISR/ATF4 signaling pathway leading to chronic suppression of mTORC1/2 activity resulting in PUMA-mediated neuronal death that may have therapeutic implications in a range of neurodegenerative conditions that exhibit chronic ISR activation.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

V.; Yogev, S.", "abstract": "Neuronal remodeling is crucial for proper nervous system development and function, and can be initiated by developmental programs, activity-dependent mechanisms, or stress. Despite significant advances, the underlying mechanisms that govern this process remain poorly understood. Here, we adapted C. elegans IL2 sensory dendrites as a model system to study developmental and stress-mediated dendrite pruning. Upon entering a stress-induced developmental diapause, IL2 dendrites grow a complex dendritic arbor, which is later pruned when reproductive development resumes. We identified unexpected specificity in the pruning process, with distinct genetic requirements to direct branch-specific elimination of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary branches. The serine/threonine kinase SAX-1/NDR promotes elimination of secondary and tertiary, but not quaternary, dendrites. SAX-1 functions with its conserved interactors SAX-2/Furry and MOB-2 in the removal of both dendritic branches. The guanine-nucleotide exchange factor RABI-1/Rabin8 and the small GTPase RAB-11.2 mediate the elimination of secondary branches with SAX-1, but their effect on tertiary branches is minimal. Consistent with the known roles of RABI-1 and RAB-11.2 in regulating membrane dynamics, we find that SAX-1 promotes endocytosis during remodeling.

As flagship species, manta rays are a drawcard for marine wildlife tourism and a gateway for engaging the public and communities in conservation. Healthy marine ecosystems are the key drivers of employment and economic sustainability for island nations such as the Maldives. However, there are many stakeholders competing for these shared resources, which can result in environmental degradation. Economic evaluations are a powerful tool for justifying the conservation efforts of threatened species and natural areas, especially in light of competing stakeholders. Using tour operator surveys (n=106) and data mining, this study provides an updated assessment of manta ray watching tourism in the Maldives, and represents the first national evaluation of its total economic and socio-economic benefits. In 2021, manta ray tourism in the Maldives generated an estimated US$227.3 million, including US$39 million on manta ray focused diving and snorkelling excursions, and US$188.3 million in related tourist expenditure. This represented 4.8% of the national Gross Domestic Product. This industry appears to have grown around 380% since 2008 (US$8.1 million) and manta ray watching is now offered by 80% of tourism operators nation-wide. Our findings revealed that manta rays hold intrinsic value and cultural significance within local communities. Acknowledging this, the flow-on benefits to the community extend beyond this industry, reaching local businesses, employed staff, and the government with the total economic benefits of the manta ray tourism industry were estimated at over US$311 million per year. Such value highlights the significance of manta rays for this nation and the need for effective management centred on manta ray conservation to safeguard future prosperity and mitigate the potential impact of tourism on manta ray populations.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

In the present study, we performed a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the validity and efficacy of intravesical delivery for kidney targeting in mice. We demonstrated that intravesical infusion was valid for a retrograde delivery of molecules up to 500 kDa to the kidney. A kinetics study revealed that the ascended molecules could stay hours in the kidney. In particular, empagliflozin, an antagonist of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), could efficiently act on the uppermost segment of the kidney tubule system, i.e., the proximal tubules, via the intravesical route, and had an action on glucose excretion. In an orthotopic kidney carcinoma model, intravesical delivery of a chemotherapeutic agent was more efficacious in limiting tumor growth, accompanied with much milder adverse effects on extrarenal organs, compared to a systemic delivery when a same dose was administered. This was due to a higher drug concentration in the kidney and a markedly lower level of drug in the blood achieved by intravesical delivery, demonstrating its kidney-targeting specificity.

R.", "abstract": "Short tandem repeats (STRs) are hotspots of genomic instability that mutate at rates orders of magnitude greater than non-repetitive loci due to frequent replication slippage. Expansions at some STR loci cause Mendelian diseases, while variation at other noncoding loci may affect complex traits, possibly by altering transcription factor occupancy of nearby binding sites. Accordingly, some STRs are inferred to be under purifying selection, regardless of their instability. One or more \"interruptions\", or bases that disrupt the locus's canonical repeat, significantly decrease an STR's mutability. For example, the onset of Huntington's Disease, a neurodegenerative disorder associated with somatic expansions of a trinucleotide coding STR, is delayed in individuals whose inherited alleles contain interruptions. Thus, interruptions that decrease mutation rate at some coding loci may broadly protect against deleterious phenotypes associated with locus instability. However, interruptions may themselves be deleterious at constrained loci, particularly at noncoding loci in gene regulatory elements, possibly disrupting the formation of secondary structures key to their function. We therefore hypothesized that the frequency of interruptions could depend on a locus's functional importance -- at constrained loci, the fitness effects of expansions but also interruptions could be more deleterious than at neutral loci. To test this hypothesis, we examined the distribution of interruptions at ~650,000 autosomal STRs. In the ~2,500 3- or 6bp-motif coding STRs, we find that synonymous interruption density increases with purifying selection on the gene, while the opposite is true for missense-causing interruptions. In contrast, noncoding STRs in gene regulatory elements harbor fewer interruptions than those unassociated with function and putatively evolving neutrally. Our findings indicate that the abundance of interruptions may be partially explained at coding STRs by the benefit of lower instability. In contrast, maintaining a minimum core stretch of uninterrupted repeat may be key to the function of noncoding STRs that fall within regulatory elements, outweighing the benefits of stability.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

The majority of dorsolateral prefrontal neurons responded to these sensory stimuli, with similar percentages of auditory-only, visual-only and audiovisual neurons. Approximately one third of responsive neurons exhibited significant super- or sub-additive interactions in response to the pairing of auditory and visual stimuli, revealing significant nonlinearities in their response profiles. Decoding motion signals from the population activity robustly differentiated multisensory from unisensory trials and also unisensory auditory and visual trials from each other.

Yet the underlying neurobiology has remained enigmatic, hindering treatment development. Methods: Here we used a combination of tools--including a well-established threat-anticipation fMRI paradigm and longitudinal assessments of internalizing symptoms and negative life events (NLEs)--to identify the neural systems associated with future internalizing illness in a risk-enriched sample of 224 emerging adults followed for 2.5 years. We performed parallel analyses in an overlapping sample of 209 participants who completed a popular threat-related faces paradigm. Results: Here we show that heightened reactivity to uncertain-threat anticipation in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the periaqueductal gray is associated with a worsening longitudinal course of broadband internalizing symptoms among individuals with low levels of NLE exposure. These associations were specific to uncertain threat and generally remained significant when controlling for concurrent measures of threat-elicited distress or psychophysiological arousal, highlighting the added value of the neuroimaging measures. Symptom trajectories were unrelated to amygdala and frontocortical reactivity to anticipated threat. Contrary to past research, amygdala reactivity to threat-related faces was unrelated to future symptoms.

Here, we introduce PDDRNet-MH, a multiplex heterogeneous network-based framework that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic tumor profiles with drug chemical structures, pharmacological activity, and side-effect data to infer personalized drug responses. PDDRNet-MH constructs an integrated network connecting patients, cell lines, drugs, and genes, with each component represented by four biologically and pharmacologically informed similarity layers.

We applied PDDRNet-MH to breast cancer patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and benchmarked its predictive performance against state-of-the-art methods on eleven FDA-approved breast cancer drugs. PDDRNet-MH achieved consistently high accuracy, with perfect prediction scores for gemcitabine and vinorelbine (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve [AUC-ROC] = 1.00; Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve [AUC-PR] = 1.00) and near-perfect scores for methotrexate and zoledronate (AUC-ROC = 0.95; AUC-PR = 0.99), demonstrating its ability to robustly distinguish sensitive from resistant patients.

To elucidate these spatio-temporal dynamics and its behavioral relevance, we studied cortico-subthalamic oscillations in 21 Parkinsons patients during a dyskinesia-provoking experiment. We differentiated between non-dyskinetic and dyskinetic periods, and split data based on a kinematic movement registration, leading to respectively resting states and voluntary movement, and active movement suppression and dyskinetic movement. Elevated theta-activity and attenuated beta-activity was found in the subthalamic nucleus during voluntary movement suppression within dyskinetic periods, while cortico-subthalamic gamma-activity was only elevated during dyskinetic movement presence. Subthalamic spectral changes significantly predicted dyskinesia presence, and the amount of registered movement significantly affected the predictive value of dyskinesia predictions.

A.; Baele, G.; Matsen, F. A.", "abstract": "Phylodynamic analysis has been instrumental in elucidating the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of pathogens. The Bayesian approach to phylodynamics integrates out phylogenetic uncertainty, which is typically substantial in phylodynamic datasets due to low genetic diversity. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis does not, however, scale with modern datasets, partly due to difficulties in traversing tree space. Here, we set out to characterize tree space of phylodynamic inference and assess its impacts on analysis difficulty and key biological estimates. By running extensive Bayesian analyses of 15 classic large phylodynamic datasets and carefully analyzing the posterior samples, we find that the posterior landscape in tree space (\"tree landscape\") is diffuse yet rugged, leading to widespread tree sampling problems that usually stem from the sequences in a small part of the tree. We develop clade-specific diagnostics to show that a few sequences---including putative recombinants and recurrent mutants---frequently drive tree space ruggedness and sampling problems, although existing data-quality tests show limited power to detect such sequences. The sampling problems can significantly impact phylodynamic inferences or even distort major biological conclusions; the impact is usually stronger on \"local\" estimates (e.g., introduction history) that are associated with particular clades than on \"global\" parameters (e.g., demographic trajectory) that are governed by the general tree shape. We evaluate existing and newly-developed MCMC diagnostics, and offer strategies for optimizing MCMC settings and mitigating impacts of the sampling problems. Our findings highlight the need for and directions to develop efficient traversal over the rugged tree landscape, ultimately advancing scalable and reliable phylodynamics.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

These limitations hinder their utility for literature searches and other tasks requiring accurate and comprehensive extraction of information from extensive scientific literature. In this study, we evaluated the performance of various LLMs in accurately retrieving peer-reviewed literature and mapping correlations between 198 genes and six phenotypes: bone formation, cartilage formation, fibrosis, cell proliferation, tendon formation, and ligament formation. Our analysis included three types of models. First, standard transformer-based LLMs (ChatGPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro). Second, specialized LLMs with dedicated custom databases containing peer-reviewed articles (SciSpace and ScholarAI). Third, specialized LLMs without dedicated databases (PubMedGPT and ScholarGPT). Using human-curated gene-to-phenotype mappings as the ground truth, we found that specialized LLMs with dedicated databases achieved the highest accuracy (>80%) in gene-to-phenotype mapping. Additionally, these models were able to provide relevant peer-reviewed publications supporting each gene-to-phenotype correlation.

In cattle, they have been previously applied to identify genes driving fertility, milk production, and health. However, these studies have also highlighted several challenges, from difficulties in reproducing these complex analyses to limitations from poor genotype calls, especially when called directly from RNA sequencing data. To address these and other challenges, for the H2020 BovReg Project, we have developed a streamlined, species-agnostic, and reusable Nextflow TWAS workflow to integrate transcriptomic and GWAS summary statistic datasets. Our workflow first generates accurate genotype calls and gene expression prediction models from transcriptomic datasets and then applies these tools to impute gene expression levels into GWAS cohorts, enabling the association of genes with traits of interest. We explore optimal strategies for calling genetic variants directly from transcriptomic data and illustrate that using imputation approaches specifically designed for low-pass sequencing data can improve variant calling over previously adopted methods. We demonstrate the utility of our TWAS workflow by applying it to both novel and publicly available GWAS cohorts for cattle, detecting novel gene-trait associations for complex traits. Using a new transcriptome annotation of the cattle genome generated for the BovReg project we also illustrate how previously un-assayable associations can be detected.

This study proposes a deep learning approach for generating spectral libraries, even for previously unseen peptides. While most deep learning-based methods rely on one-hot encoding representation for peptides, the proposed method incorporates physicochemical features, including atomic composition, hydrophobicity, flexibility, fractional surface probability, and aromaticity. We introduce sparsity regularized neural network layers to facilitate the selection and combination of important high-dimensional physicochemical features and improve prediction performance. Furthermore, we suggest a transfer learning strategy for training the proposed deep neural networks having multiple heterogeneous input channels. Numerical experiments using benchmark DDA-MS data demonstrated that the proposed deep learning model outperformed existing benchmark models, such as Prosit and DeepDIA, particularly in predicting retention times.

To address this challenge, we introduce the application of a series of multi-instance learning frameworks for automated flow cytometry data analysis. Our models demonstrate strong performance across diverse biomedical applications, including cancer subtyping based on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, HIV survival stratification, AML minimal residual disease prediction, and COVID-19 severity assessment. We further examine how network architecture affects predictive performance and the detection of rare but clinically significant cell populations. Notably, our models utilize attention mechanisms to directly identify phenotype-associated cell subsets, serving as an interpretable, data-driven alternative to fully manual gating.

This represents a bottleneck in efforts to develop pro-senescence therapeutics - agents designed to induce the arrest of cellular proliferation associated with a senescence response in cancer cells for therapeutic gain. This is particularly true in contexts such as basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), which often express high levels of widely reported senescence hallmarks, which has led to the designation of these subtypes as senescence marker positive (Sen-Mark+). Unfortunately, these are often cancers with the most limited treatment options, where novel pro-senescence compounds would be of potential clinical utility. Results To address these challenges, we have developed SAMP-Score, a machine learning classification tool for identifying senescence induction in Sen-Mark+ cancers. This technique builds upon our previous observation that senescent cells develop distinct senescence-associated morphological profiles (SAMPs), which can be assessed readily in traditionally challenging contexts for senescence identification, including high-throughput screens. Conclusions Through application of SAMP-Score, we have identified QM5928, a novel pro-senescence compound, that is able to induce senescence in a variety of Sen-Mark+ cancers and has potential utility as a tool molecule to explore the mechanisms and pathways through which senescence induction occurs in these cells.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we reveal that the FERONIA receptor-like kinase facilitates cuticle development in the epidermis and FER-mediated cuticle formation limits the propagation of wound-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), which trigger callus formation. Cuticle defects stimulate NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, which leads to unrestricted callus formation. However, the cuticle formed in mesophyll cells in the vicinity of the wound suppresses ROS propagation, thereby preventing unorganized callus formation beyond the wound-proximal site and activating programmed cell death adjacent to the wound.

The AIM and FInD paradigms show a range of visual stimuli per display (4x4 stimuli) spanning 2SD; around an adaptively estimated perceptual threshold across multiple displays. Here, we investigated the repeatability and behavioral relationships of the AIM and FinD paradigms for near visual acuity, contrast sensitivity function (CSF), form, and motion coherence threshold measurements using a novel tablet-based vision test tool. 31 healthy participants were recruited and repeated two repetitions of each experiment in random order. Bland-Altman analyses were performed to calculate the Coefficient of Repeatability (precision) and Mean Bias (accuracy). Linear regressions and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to investigate the relationship between outcome parameters. Results show that AIM Form coherence and FInD Form horizontal coherence showed significant retest bias; all other tests were bias-free. Cluster analysis revealed overall clustering of CSF, form and motion outcomes. We further show significant correlations within CSF and between motion coherence outcomes but few significant correlations between form coherence outcomes. AIM and FInD near vision tests are generalizable across multiple visual functions and are precise and reliable. Most functions tested were bias-free.

P.; Formoso-Rafferty, N.; Khayatzadeh, N.; Cervantes, I.", "abstract": "Uniformity of production traits is desired for different traits in livestock species, including the uniformity of within-litter birth weights in piglets. Birth weight (BW) in pigs is associated with increased vitality and survival until weaning. However, as uniformity of BW increases, the importance of initial weight decreases as competition between piglets decreases. The aim of this study was to estimate the direct and maternal genetic components of BW, jointly with the maternal genetic component of the residual variance for within-litter BW, and their genetic correlations. We used two distinct datasets of Swiss Large White pigs: 1) the experimental farm dataset and 2) the commercial farms dataset, comprising 43,135 and 23,313 records of individual piglet birth weight, respectively. For statistical analysis, the heteroscedastic (or canalising selection) model was used. This model assumes that both the mean BW and the residual variance are affected by systematic and random effects, with the residual variance being heterogeneous and partially under genetic control. Despite the best fitting model was the most complex one including both genetic effects for the mean trait, the results indicated that direct genetic effects, or correlations with such effects, are negligible. The genetic environmental variance for BW ranged between 0.071 and 0.131 for experimental farm and 0.037 to 0.094. The genetic correlation between the mean BW and its variability was always positive and ranged between 0.149 and 0.307 for the experimental farm and between 0.220 and 0.589 for the commercial farms. It is thus sufficient to model BW and its variability by including only the maternal genetic effect for both traits. In addition, even though moderate genetic correlations exist between the mean and the variance of BW, focusing selection on BW uniformity within litters would be preferable to creating a selection index for both traits simultaneously.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Despite this shared mechanism, computational models of loop extrusion often rely on fundamentally different assumptions: interphase models typically use dynamic extruders with finite lifetimes, while mitotic models employ static extruders placed according to loop size distributions. In this work, we investigate whether these modeling paradigms are interchangeable or yield intrinsically incompatible results. Using publicly available Hi-C data from mitotic chicken cells, we systematically compare dynamic and static loop extrusion models implemented in the Polychrom framework. We evaluate how key parameters such as extruder lifetime, extrusion velocity, and spatial noise affect simulated contact probability curves P(s) and loop size distributions. Our results reveal that while both model types can be tuned to approximate the general shape of P(s), they produce distinct internal structures and divergent relationships between loop size and contact decay. We also show that increased extruder lifetimes lead to excessive nested loop formation, which alters both loop statistics and P(s) derivatives. Introducing spatial exclusion constraints between extruders partially restores consistency with static models. These findings highlight that differences in extruder behavior and polymer noise levels can significantly impact chromatin model outcomes and must be carefully accounted for when interpreting or comparing simulation results across biological conditions.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

We hypothesize that Stearoyl-Coenzyme A Desaturase (SCD) acts as a tumor-promoting enzyme by modulating cellular stress to support the growth and survival of prostate cancer (PCa) in bone. We observe that SCD-amplified PCa cells are highly sensitive to SCD loss and show reduced PCa spheroid size, diminished mTOR signaling, and increased ER stress. Notably, SCD expression is further increased by adipocytes in SCD-amplified cell lines, and its loss increases DNA damage and activates repair pathways in PCa cells only when exposed to adipocytes. Furthermore, we observe PCa cell lines utilize SCD to regulate adipocyte-induced lipid peroxidation. Aligned with these results, pharmacological SCD inhibition in mice bearing SCD-amplified bone tumors reduces tumor size and reveals histochemical evidence of increased ER stress and DNA damage.

K.; Chandra, N.; Rangarajan, A.", "abstract": "Although several cancer cells are shed into the circulation, most die due to the stresses they encounter. Detachment from the underlying extracellular matrix is one major stress; cell death due to matrix detachment is known as anoikis. Few cancer cells overcome this stress, become anoikis-resistant, and survive to seed metastasis. Autophagy, a cell survival mechanism during stressful conditions that promotes cellular homeostasis by recycling cellular components, is activated upon matrix detachment. On the other hand, apoptosis is a cellular mechanism that is responsible for programmed cell death which is also activated upon matrix detachment. It is unclear how matrix-deprived cancer cells maintain a balance between autophagy and apoptosis to decide the cell fate: whether the cell dies due to anoikis or acquires anoikis-resistance and survives to seed metastasis. Though multiple pathways contribute to cell fate decisions, we have shown experimentally that autophagy and apoptosis are influenced by Akt-AMPK axis and AMPK-ERK axis in matrix-deprived cancer cells. Since Akt, AMPK and ERK are in turn linked to each other it is essential to understand how these proteins simultaneously affect the cell signaling and survival/death outcomes of matrix-deprived cancer cells. To study the cumulative effect of Akt-AMPK-ERK activities on survival/death decisions and to understand the fine balance between apoptosis and autophagy that facilitates the survival/death of matrix-deprived cancer cells, we formulated a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based protein interaction model of anoikis resistance. Model stability analysis and 3D-nullcline analysis depicted that the system has a unique steady state in matrix-attached and matrix-deprived condition. Parameter sensitivity analysis depicted that the model is highly robust, and the model variables are sensitive to only a few model parameters. By simulating differential activity of pAkt, pAMPK and pERK, the model predicted a heterogeneity in pERK levels: high/low levels pERK along with high pAMPK enable survival as long as levels of pAkt are maintained low. Additionally, the model predicted a heterogeneity in pAMPK: high/low levels of pAMPK along with low pERK determines the shift from survival to death when levels of pAkt are high. Such high levels of pAkt are obtained at critically low levels of pERK. Molecular perturbation revealed a hierarchy among proteins while deciding the cell fate: pAkt dominates over pAMPK which further dominates over pERK and intermediate to high levels of pAkt were sufficient for apoptosis to surpass autophagy in matrix-detached cells. The model also predicted that Akt impacts apoptosis more than autophagy and classified the cell fate decision into survival and death zones in matrix-deprived condition. Overall, this work provided multiple insights on the molecular interplay among key kinases Akt, AMPK and ERK and their effects on apoptosis and autophagy. This model also depicted that autophagosome formation is rather robust as compared to apoptosis which is more sensitive to molecular perturbations. Hence, apoptosis emerged as a deciding factor that influences the decision of cell fate of a matrix-deprived cancer cell.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

To date the role of SWEET-released sucrose for virulence remains unclear. We here identified the sux locus of Xoo consisting of a LacI-type repressor (SuxR), an outer membrane TonB-like porin (SuxA), an inner membrane MFS H+-symporter (SuxC) and a cytosolic sucrose hydrolase (SuxB). Structural and functional analyses demonstrate that SuxB has exclusive sucrose hydrolase activity. Mutant analyses show that the transporter SuxC and the sucrose hydrolase are necessary for growth of bacteria on sucrose, while SuxA is not essential, likely due the ability of other porins to transport sucrose across the outer membrane. Consistent with a role of SuxR as a sucrose repressor, transcriptome studies show sucrose-dependent regulation of the suxA/suxB genes. Besides a role of sucrose for reproduction, we found that sucrose promotes motility, EPS production, biofilm formation, and virulence. Notably, the SuxC sucrose H+-symporter and the sucrose hydrolase SuxB were required for full virulence of Xoo on indica and japonica rice varieties. Our findings indicate that pathogen-induced sucrose efflux via SWEETs provides sucrose to Xoo, that Xoo uses the sux gene cluster to acquire and utilize sucrose, and that sucrose promotes bacterial fitness and xylem colonization.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Leveraging these comprehensive datasets, we developed PPIKB, a user friendly database and analysis platform that enables efficient querying, visualization, and in depth analysis of protein peptide interactions. PPIKB also provides a suite of tools tailored to facilitate peptide based drug discovery, protein engineering, and systems level biological research. By combining state of the art text mining technologies with expert validation, PPIKB sets a new standard for accessibility and utility in the field of protein peptide interaction data resources.

O.; Arpinar, I.

Traditional detection methods for HGT, such as phylogenetic incongruence and compositional analysis, are often limited in their scope and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that integrates genomic, environmental, biochemical, and ontological datasets to detect and analyze HGT events contributing to AMR. Our KG captures relationships among genes, plasmids, species, mobile genetic elements, antibiotics, and ecological factors using curated sources like NCBI, CARD, ICEberg, MGnify, and KEGG. We enrich nodes and edges with biological (e.g., GC content, codon bias) and chemical (e.g., binding affinities, environmental exposure) signatures and apply ontology-based semantic enrichment using ARO and GO. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained on the KG achieves high accuracy (92%) and F1-score (0.90) in predicting HGT events, outperforming conventional methods. Community detection identifies AMR dissemination hubs, while environmental analyses reveal strong correlations between antibiotic concentrations and resistance gene prevalence. Our framework demonstrates strong biological and chemical validation and provides a scalable, interpretable, and data-rich tool for AMR surveillance, with implications for clinical, agricultural, and environmental microbiology.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

We investigated death receptor 5 (DR5) as a CAR target based on its high expression in both solid tumors and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). We engineered agonistic DR5-specific CAR constructs and evaluated their activity in multiple models, demonstrating DR5-expression-dependent tumor killing, confirmed by knockout and overexpression experiments. DR5-targeting single-chain variable fragments retained their pro-apoptotic activity when expressed on non-effector cells or extracellular vesicles. Among multiple CAR designs, we identified a construct with optimized binding affinity that maintained T cell viability while preserving strong tumor and MDSC-killing potency. To assess safety and efficacy in an immunocompetent setting, we also developed a murine DR5-targeted CAR. In multiple xenograft and syngeneic mouse models, DR5 CAR-T cells reduced tumor growth, prolonged survival, and did not cause detectable toxicity. In patient-derived organoids and tissue slices, DR5 CAR-T cells infiltrated tumor tissues, reduced MDSCs, boosted CD8+ T cell activity, and inhibited tumor growth.

To address this challenge, we developed ARTIC HELP (Homebrew Enzymes for Library Preparation), a practical, open-source adaptation of the widely adopted ARTIC nanopore sequencing protocol for viral genomic surveillance. We describe generic, cost-effective alternatives to all enzyme mixes used in tiling multiplex RT-PCR amplification of the virus genome, and the nanopore native barcoding workflow, including end-prep (EP), barcode ligation (BL), and adapter ligation (AL), making it broadly applicable to any laboratory. Through systematic evaluation, we identified a wild-type M-MLV reverse transcriptase and two types of proofreading DNA polymerases as effective alternatives when standard reagents are unavailable due to high cost or limited supply: B-family Pfu-based polymerases with a fused Sso7d DNA-binding domain, and blends combining A-family (Taq-based) and B-family (Pfu-based) polymerases. Validation on clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII confirmed that the HELP workflow achieves genome coverage comparable to the ARTIC LoCost protocol. For SARS-CoV-2 samples (Ct [&le;]28), the wild-type M-MLV RT combined with selected Pfu or A+B polymerases, along with optimised HELP mixes (EP, BL, AL), achieved genome coverage of 84.0-99.6%. For Norovirus GII (Ct [&le;]32), the HELP workflow using one of the Pfu polymerases achieved genome coverage of >85% for six out of eight genotypes tested. Notably, several of the other polymerases tested showed reduced performance at higher Ct values. However, they still achieved strong coverage at Ct <24, supporting their use as emergency alternatives in rapid outbreak-response sequencing when viral input is high and RNA quality is sufficient. Our approach, ARTIC HELP, provides a framework which can be implemented to address supply chain disruptions, while maintaining robust genomic sequencing capabilities. A cost analysis highlights the well-known significant global disparities in reagent pricing, driven not by protocol differences but by import fees and supply barriers. Thus, our findings highlight the need for fairer global pricing models and support for local sourcing strategies like HELP, to promote equity in genomic research and ensure preparedness for future public health challenges.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Current state-of-the-art OPM systems are housed in immobile magnetically-shielded rooms to reduce external electromagnetic noise, and typically comprise sensor arrays covering the entire head. Here we sought to validate a low-cost, mobile OPM system comprising a small cylindrical mu-metal shield and partial sensor coverage. Twelve participants underwent right-sided median nerve stimulation (MNS) and cued right-handed button-pressing intended to elicit ubiquitous sensorimotor responses: somatosensory-evoked fields (SEFs; comprising N20m, P35m and P60m components) and event-related (de)synchronisation (ERD/ERS) of oscillatory neuronal rhythms in the mu and beta frequency ranges. Following MNS, we observed robust N20m and P60m peaks, as well as the expected mu ERD and beta ERS effects. Moreover, we successfully localized these responses to expected cortical generators using distributed source modelling. SEFs and mu ERD were both maximal in left (i.e., contralateral to stimulation) primary somatosensory cortex (central sulcus, postcentral gyrus and sulcus), while beta ERS appeared more anteriorly, in the central sulcus and precentral gyrus. By contrast, results from the button-pressing paradigm were less conclusive - we observed beta ERS (but not mu/beta ERD), and an atypical distribution of the ERS effect over posterior ROIs. Overall, our findings provide proof-of-principle support for the use of our system in the context of passive (e.g., MNS) paradigms; its viability for cued movement tasks will require further development.

Neuroinflammation is now strongly associated with both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, providing a strong rationale for development of novel therapeutics targeting common neuroinflammatory mechanisms. RTT is caused by mutations in the methylated DNA binding factor MECP2. Mecp2-deficient (Mecp2-KO) mice, which have been extensively characterized as a mouse model of RTT, exhibit high levels of neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and severe neurological symptoms similar to RTT patients. KIT-13 is a novel plasmalogen derivative being developed for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders including RTT. This study evaluated KIT-13 in both cell-based and in vivo models for its potential to inhibit neuroinflammation and address underlying mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as effects on RTT-like neurological symptoms in the RTT mouse model. Oral administration of KIT-13 to Mecp2-KO mice significantly reduced neurological symptoms assessed by a composite score evaluating mobility, gait, hindlimb clasping, tremor, breathing, and general condition and improved the life span of the RTT model mice. In addition, KIT-13 suppressed mitochondrial DNA leakage associated with Mecp2 deficiency, and significantly suppressed neuroinflammation as measured by microglial cell morphology.

First, we compared distributions and potential interpretations of each metric. Then, we assessed how well different metrics captured topology change estimates by comparing them to individual-level changes in clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and network strength. As multivariate metrics may be more reliable than single connections and researchers often interpret connectivity changes in topological terms, this offers additional insight into the implications of change score choice. Overall, our analyses revealed widely different distributions between change scores that conferred vastly different results and interpretations of functional connectivity changes between time points.

This was accompanied by the upregulation of scar-resolving genes (Mmp14, Ctsl), restoration of fenestrae in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, anti-inflammatory phenotypes of Kupffer cells, a decrease in fibrogenic cholangiocyte subsets, and recovery-associated signatures in NK/T cells, B cells, and neutrophils.

While there are established resilience metrics, they often do not account for agency, which is crucial in social-ecological systems. Pathway diversity is a recent approach to measuring resilience that integrates systems thinking with individual-based elements, such as agency. According to this approach, resilience is larger if actors have more decision pathways and can maintain them over time. Here we measure resilience using pathway diversity within a lake eutrophication model to analyse (a) the extent to which it is sensitive to changes in agency and (b) its compatibility with more established resilience metrics. Our findings reveal that pathway diversity is sensitive to regime shifts and can provide early warnings of them. Through five policy decision-making scenarios, we then show how pathway diversity can capture constraints on decision makers' capability and agency that affect the system's resilience. We find that higher pathway diversity is associated with greater capability of decision-makers to influence the system. Pathway diversity addresses a critical gap by incorporating agency into a resilience metric while remaining compatible with established metrics.

To shed light on the role of fires in promoting or limiting biodiversity, we studied the compositional and functional diversity of simulated plant communities as a function of different fire frequencies. We extended an existing model to include a large number of species. The model reproduces successional dynamics and is parameterized to represent Boreal and Mediterranean plant communities. Fire events are stochastic, with frequency that depends on the community flammability, and plants have different fire responses, thus representing a vegetation-fire feedback. For both ecosystems, we found that fires generally have a positive effect on diversity. All of the biodiversity indicators analyzed, to some extent, peaked at intermediate fire frequency.

Although theoretical models suggest that such divergence is notably facilitated by small population size and genetic polymorphisms influencing reproductive timing, though constrained by genetic load, empirical validation remains limited. We investigated these predictions by re-analyzing a case of allochronic differentiation between two sympatric populations of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) in Portugal, using whole genome resequencing (IndSeq and PoolSeq) of those two populations and eight allopatric ones. We inferred the demographic history of those populations, assessed their genetic load, and searched for genomic regions associated with life cycle differences. Our analyses revealed a recent split between the sympatric allochronic populations, accompanied by a strong reduction in gene flow, bottlenecks, inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious variants. Genome scans identified several loci associated with life cycle variation, including genes putatively involved in circadian rhythm regulation. These loci were predominantly located on the Z chromosome, which overall exhibited a marked reduction in diversity in the population with the shifted phenology, likely caused by a bottleneck and an interruption of gene flow at the Z in this population. We discuss how these empirical genomic findings support theoretical expectations that assortative mating driven by differences in reproductive timing, underpinned by polymorphisms in circadian genes, along with genetic drift and purge of genetic load at high-impact sites, can promote the onset and persistence of allochronic divergence.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

By comparing the relative impacts of these mutation classes, along with the involvement of transposable elements (TEs), we assess whether certain mutations are more likely to contribute to rapid divergence. We show that TEs are disproportionately involved in the formation of novel structural variants shortly after colonization, particularly through direct insertions. Our results suggest that TE-associated rearrangements may bypass the clocklike pace of SNP accumulation and divergence, where the contributions of coding SNPs, tandem duplications, and TE-facilitated ectopic recombination are constrained to standing variation on short timescales. Although TEs can drive the rapid emergence of novel variants, their full contribution to adaptation likely depends on evolutionary context and time since colonization.

While superoxide can cause oxidative damage to the cell, we and others have shown that a mild increase in mitochondrial superoxide extends longevity in multiple model organisms. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved, we identified transcriptional changes in mitochondrial superoxide dismutase deletion mutants (sod-2 worms) using RNA sequencing. sod-2 mutants exhibit a number of changes in nuclear gene expression resulting from elevated mitochondrial superoxide suggesting that mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling is contributing to their longevity. Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated that genes involved in innate immunity and cuticle formation are significantly upregulated in sod-2 worms. To identify kinases involved in this lifespan-extending pathway, we completed a targeted RNA interference screen to examine the contribution of 61 selected kinases to sod-2 longevity. From this screen, we found 25 kinases which are required for the long lifespan of sod-2 mutants including mak-2, which has an established role in a kinase signaling pathway involved in axon regeneration. Disruption of mak-2 specifically reduces sod-2 lifespan but not wild-type longevity and also decreases resistance to multiple exogenous stressors. In examining other genes that act with mak-2 in pathways controlling axon regeneration, we identified a SEK-3/PMK-3/MAK-2/CEBP-1 signaling pathway that is specifically required for sod-2 longevity but not wild-type lifespan.

Hormone bioavailability is regulated by their synthesis and transport, as well as sequestration, natural turnover, and programmed degradation. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to investigate developmentally programmed degradation of the retinoic acid-like Juvenile hormones (JHs) that functionally oppose the steroid hormone, ecdysone. Elevated JH titers promote growth and prevent metamorphosis. To understand the role of programmed JH degradation, we generated double and triple knockout animals lacking one of two classes of JH degradation enzymes: JH esterases (JHEs) and JH epoxide hydrolases (JHEHs). While both classes of enzymes degrade JHs, we found they have separate developmental functions such that JHEs restrain growth while JHEHs support growth and ensure timely metamorphosis. To investigate the nature of these unique developmental requirements, we performed genetic and hormone rescue experiments, analyzed hormone-producing glands, and characterized dysregulated gene networks by RNA-sequencing. Together, these data revealed unique dysregulated networks consistent with the separate developmental requirements, as well as shared regulation of Cytochrome P450 gene expression and the size of the ecdysone-producing gland. Strikingly, the four-day delay in metamorphosis in the absence of JHEHs is rescued by ecdysone despite increased ecdysone synthesis gene expression and larger glands in these animals.

These TEs ostensibly act as mutualists by elongating chromosome ends, but evidence from species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster suggests that telomeric transposons may also antagonize their host genome. Importantly, the limited number of Drosophila species characterized thus far has precluded our ability to delineate idiosyncratic from universal evolutionary forces and genetic mechanisms that shape the history of these TEs. Here, we have surveyed long-read genome assemblies of over 100 species of Drosophila, identifying a total of 396 telomeric TE families. Our findings show that these telomere-specialized elements evolve rapidly and also undergo striking convergent evolution: the complete loss of telomeric TEs has occurred repeatedly across the genus while individual telomeric TE lineages have repeatedly lost one of their two protein-coding genes. These elements have also repeatedly undergone horizontal transfer between distantly related Drosophila lineages and have repeatedly captured host gene fragments that promote their selfish suppression of host TE-silencing systems. Furthermore, telomere specialization itself appears to have evolved convergently, as some non-telomeric families have gained the ability to target their insertions to telomeres. These results provide unprecedented resolution into the evolution of these unusual TEs and highlight several novel mechanisms by which they evolve in conflict both with each other and their host genome despite the essential telomere function they provide.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular distinctions between TGCT subtypes remain poorly understood. Here we present a comprehensive genomic analysis of 252 treatment-naive primary TGCTs, integrating deep whole-genome sequencing with matched transcriptomic and epigenomic data. We identify new driver genes and uncover defining features of TGCTs, including pervasive chromosome X amplification with subtype-specific X chromosome inactivation, and a germ cell-like transcriptional program. Although previously reported, whole genome doubling (WGD) in TGCTs is further characterized here as ubiquitous, developmentally early, and associated with age at onset. Seminomas are enriched for early driver mutations, secondary WGD events, sustained XIST expression and replication stress-associated indel mutational signatures, while non-seminomas show greater structural complexity, subclonal diversity, relatively earlier-onset WGD, extended tumor latency, and telomere elongation. Moreover, we identify a thiopurine-like mutational signature, SBS87, that is exceptionally rare across all other cancers but strikingly prevalent in TGCT, especially non-seminomas. SBS87 is linked to extended tumor latency and telomere elongation, implicating possible environmental or endogenous processes that mimic thiopurine-induced DNA damage in TGCT pathogenesis. Collectively, our findings define TGCTs as molecularly distinct tumors shaped by early genomic instability and highlight SBS87 as a novel mutational footprint with potential etiologic and clinical relevance.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

H.; Mercado, E.; Tietjen, N.; Levin, I.; Ryan, M.", "abstract": "Humpback whales construct predictably patterned sequences within multi-hour sessions of sound production. These sequences (called \"songs\") are some of the most structurally and acoustically complex vocal patterns produced by any mammal. Humpback whale song production is highly dynamic in that individuals constantly modify the properties of songs across multiple time scales throughout their adult lives. Past analyses of co-vocalizing humpback whales suggest that singers within earshot of one another may dynamically and interactively adjust their vocalizations in reaction to what they hear. The current study investigated whether singing humpback whales coordinate their production of overlapping sound patterns either by modulating how long they produce similar patterns or by dynamically adjusting the spectral properties of individual sounds and/or sound sequences. Our results show that the vocal adjustments singing humpback whales make when singing in dyads are diverse and appear to depend on the acoustic context. These findings confirm that individual singers flexibly adjust song features in real-time. When pairs of singers adjust song content, they do so in ways that may increase or decrease the acoustic similarity of concurrent sound patterns. No evidence was found of singers adjusting the number or timing of sound pattern repetitions to alter pattern overlap. However, most singers modified how they produced units after a second singer began singing. The current results suggest that co-singing humpback whales attend to the vocal actions of other audible singers and may sometimes modulate song content to initiate social interactions from long distances. Understanding how singing whales vocally interact can clarify the relevance of singing in coordinating vertebrate behavior.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Microglia orchestrate neuroinflammation and regulate synaptic plasticity, and low-frequency stimulation has been shown to promote anti-inflammatory microglial phenotypes. We therefore examined, over the first three days post-implantation, how 10-Hz ICMS influences microglial-neuronal interactions in vivo using two-photon imaging in Cx3cr1-GFP/jRGECO1a mice. A one-hour session of 10-Hz ICMS did not induce overt morphological activation of microglia but increased their process motility, directing extensions toward both the electrode and neurons exhibiting elevated calcium activity. By post-implantation Day 2, microglial extensions were significantly biased toward neurons whose {Delta}F/F surpassed a 3 standard deviation threshold after stimulation onset (74.26 {degrees} {+/-} 11.83 {degrees}) but shifted away from those same neurons after 40 min of continuous stimulation (116.99 {degrees} {+/-} 9.19 {degrees} ) (p = 0.001732), suggesting a dynamic, homeostatic response to sustained neuronal calcium elevations. Although multi-day electrode insertion accelerated microglial motility and polarization toward the device, 10-Hz ICMS alone did not alter microglial branching or soma shape. Microglial contact frequency scaled with neuronal adaptation profiles: depressed neurons received the most contacts immediately post-implant (1.15 {+/-} 0.3 contacts; p = .0460).

In this study, we assess the frequency of multiplets across diverse publicly available datasets and evaluate how well commonly used detection tools are able to identify them. Using cell hashing data to determine a lower bound of the true multiplet rate, we demonstrate that commonly used heuristic estimations systematically underestimate multiplet rates, and that existing tools-despite optimized parameters-detect only a small subset of cell-hashing multiplets. We further refine a Poisson-based model to estimate the true multiplet rate, revealing that actual rates can exceed heuristic predictions by more than twofold. Downstream analyses are significantly affected by multiplets: they are not confined to isolated clusters but are distributed throughout the transcriptional landscape, where they distort clustering and cell type annotation. Using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, we visualize these effects and show that cell-hashing-informed multiplet removal eliminates artefactual clusters and improves annotation clarity, whereas computationally detected multiplets fail to fully remove artefacts in the most common experimental contexts. Our findings confirm that multiplet contamination remains a pervasive and under-addressed issue in scRNA-seq analysis. Since most datasets lack multiplexing, researchers must often rely on heuristics and limited tools, leaving many multiplets unidentified.

W.", "abstract": "Motivation: Realising the value of large DNA sequence collections demands efficient search and extraction of sequences of interest. Search queries may vary in size from short gene sequences to multiple whole genomes that are too large to fit in computer memory. In microbial genomics, a routine search application involving both large queries and large collections is the removal of contaminating host genome sequences from microbial (meta)genomes. Where the host is human, sensitive classification and excision of host sequences is usually necessary to protect host genetic information. Precise classification is also critical in order to retain microbial sequences and permit accurate microbial genomic analysis. While human pangenomes have been shown to increase sensitivity of human sequence classification, existing bioinformatic host depletion approaches have either limited precision when used with metagenomes or large computing resource requirements. Results: We present Deacon, an efficient and versatile sequence filter for raw sequence files and streams. We demonstrate its leading accuracy for the task of host depletion, using less computing resource than existing approaches. By querying a human pangenome index for minimizers contained in each input sequence, Deacon is able to accurately classify and discard diverse human sequences from long reads at over 250Mbp/s with a commodity laptop. We present validation of classification sensitivity, specificity and speed with simulated short and long reads for diverse catalogues of human, bacterial and viral genomes alongside existing methods. Beyond host depletion, Deacon is well suited to common sequence search and filtering applications, particularly those involving large queries. Capable of indexing a human genome in under 30s, Deacon is equipped to rapidly compose custom minimizer indexes using set operations, facilitating efficient search and filtering of massive sequence datasets using gigabase queries.

This lack of interpretability makes it challenging to evaluate whether biological variation is preserved, which can compromise downstream analyses. Here, we introduce NetworkVI, a sparse deep generative model designed for the integration and interpretation of multimodal single-cell data. NetworkVI utilizes biological prior knowledge as an inductive bias, specifically it relies on gene-gene interactions inferred from topologically associated domains and structured ontologies like the Gene Ontology to aggregate gene embeddings to cell embeddings, enhancing the interpretability at the gene and subcellular level. While achieving state-of-the-art data integration, modality imputation, and cell label transfer via query-to-reference mapping benchmarks across bimodal and trimodal datasets, NetworkVI additionally excels in providing biologically meaningful modality- and cell type-specific interpretations. NetworkVI aids researchers in identifying associations between genes and biological processes and uncovers immune evasion mechanisms in a Perturb CITE-seq dataset of melanoma cells.

Here, we introduce the Cross-Species Latent Alignment Network (CSLAN), a transfer learning framework that effectively bridges this gap for robust cell type classification. CSLAN employs a novel strategy involving focused feature selection on source (mouse) data followed by pre-training an encoder-decoder architecture. Crucially, for transfer to human data, only the encoder is fine-tuned while the latent space processor and the decoder, which encapsulate learned, conserved cell type signatures, remains fixed. This targeted adaptation mechanism allows CSLAN to achieve exceptional accuracy (e.g., 96.67\\% for human immune cells in a trauma context) by efficiently aligning human gene expression profiles to a biologically informed latent space derived from mouse data.

Numerous in vitro studies have demonstrated that natural polyanionic NCPs and their analogues can mediate intrafibrillar mineralization, characterized by the infiltration of apatite minerals into collagen fibrils. However, these studies primarily utilize self-assembled collagen fibrils or demineralized mature tissues, leaving it unclear whether pristine embryonic bone ECM at a developmental stage permissive to mineral deposition can regulate intrafibrillar mineralization independently or requires polyanionic NCP substitutes to promote the process artificially. To address this, we employed an ex vivo model of endochondral ossification using metatarsals isolated from 15-day-old embryonic mice (E15). In addition to a supersaturated calcium (Ca) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) medium, we introduced fetuin-A, a native polyanionic NCP or poly-DL-aspartic acid (pAsp), commonly used as an NCP substitute. The incorporation of either additive was essential for the effective mineralization of embryonic metatarsals. Both fetuin-A and pAsp played a direct role in facilitating the infiltration of Ca-Pi precursors into the avascular cartilaginous matrix. Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of hydroxyapatite (HAp) exhibiting diverse levels of crystallinity, with fetuin-A supplementation resulting in the greatest HAp accumulation within the rudiments. HAp was localized in the perichondrium, a region conducive to initial mineralization and enriched with a fibrillar network of collagen types I and II.

Since isoDGR-modified extracellular matrix proteins are enriched in atherosclerosis and have been associated with rupture-prone plaque characteristics, we hypothesized that antibody neutralisation can inhibit key pathological features including atherosclerotic vascular plaque formation and metabolic dysfunction. Methods: We first examined Pcmt1-/- mice which rapidly accumulate isoDGR due to lack of the corresponding repair enzyme to assess the extent of vascular protein damage. We then treated 6-8 week old atherosclerosis-prone (ApoE-/-) mice which were fed a high-fat Western diet (WD) with weekly dose of 1mg/kg isoDGR-specific monoclonal antibody (isoDGR-mAb) or isotype-matched control (while on diet) for 2 months duration. A regular chow-fed ApoE-/- group served as baseline control. Aortic atherosclerotic burden, plaque composition, systemic inflammation, lipid profiles, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic parameters (indirect calorimetry) were assessed. Results: Pcmt1-/- mice displayed extensive isoDGR deposition and degeneration of the aortic wall, linking this DPM to vascular structural damage. In the ApoE-/- mice, WD induced large aortic root plaques with abundant isoDGR and macrophage infiltration. IsoDGR-mAb treatment decreased plaque size by ~30% with reduced lipid and collagen content (p=0.001). Furthermore, plaques in treated mice contained significantly fewer CD68+ macrophages that also exhibited limited activation. Systemically, isoDGR-mAb modified lipoprotein profiles by decreasing atherogenic VLDL/IDL/LDL cholesterol (p=0.04) while slightly increasing HDL, accompanied by a reduction in circulating inflammatory proteins. IsoDGR-mAb also protected against hepatic lipid accumulation which was reduced by ~60% in treated animals (p<0.001), with indirect calorimetry confirming ~30% higher oxygen consumption and energy expenditure without change in food intake or physical activity. Conclusion: We identified isoDGR as a key pathological factor involved in the progression of atherosclerosis. Remarkably, isoDGR neutralization diminished plaque inflammation and improved atherosclerotic plaque stability.

A tendency of mitochondrial RNA-edit sites to mislead phylogenetic analysis in mixed transcriptomic/genomic data sets needs attention in angiosperm-wide studies, which only rarely consider mitochondrial genomes. Methods: We compared mitochondrial- vs. plastid-based phylogenomic inferences, examined the effect of removing putative RNA-edit sites from mitochondrial data, and performed combined organellar analysis (plastid plus filtered mitochondrial genomes). We expanded taxon sampling for multiple angiosperm lineages for phylogenomic analysis using both organellar genomes, representing several poorly sampled lineages (in particular Degeneriaceae, Trimeniaceae) with smaller (few-gene) data sets. Results: Plastid-based inferences recover well-supported relationships that align with and build upon previous studies, and recover well-supported internal relationships for two ANA-grade families (Hydatellaceae, Trimeniaceae) sampled for nearly all species. By contrast, unfiltered mitochondrial inferences of angiosperm phylogeny are generally poorly supported, and recover anomalous relationships compared to plastid-based inferences. However, removing putative mitochondrial RNA-edit sites dramatically reduces inter-organellar conflict and improves overall branch support. Conclusions: We accounted for phylogenomic discordance between the two organellar genomes regarding overall angiosperm-wide relationships and filled in taxonomic gaps (poorly sampled lineages). Removing RNA edit sites substantially improves congruence in interorganellar inferences by effectively correcting a systematic bias in mitochondrial data. Uncertain relationships persist among five major mesangiosperm lineages in plastid-based inferences, but a clade comprising Chloranthales, Ceratophyllales and eudicots is well supported by filtered mitochondrial data.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Bayesian estimator models5 suggest that optimal saccadic suppression should rely not just on the sensory-motor information being processed, but also on the time-dependent magnitude of unexplained variability in the nervous system encoding it. In both macaques and zebrafish larvae, and using matched visual stimulation regimes across the species, we experimentally measured saccadic suppression strength in the superior colliculus (SC) of the monkeys and the homologous optic tectum (OT) of the fish. We also experimentally quantified additive and multiplicative noise components in the motor systems of both species, and we furthermore estimated noise in the sensory systems. We found that inter-species differences in noise levels and their theoretically predicted impacts on visual sensitivity are qualitatively consistent with our experimentally observed differences in saccadic suppression strength between the fish and the monkeys. Because sensory and motor noise levels can reflect the amounts of available neural resources committed to a given task, our results strongly underscore the value of incorporating computational resource limits in investigating performance differences that have evolved in homologous brain areas.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Method: We adapted a drinking in the dark, active cycle, limited access (4 hr.) voluntary drinking paradigm first described by Brady et al. (2012) to test tubes and the volumetric drinking monitor. 8 mice were placed in either drinking method and we evaluated their drinking volume and blood alcohol concentrations (BACs). We compared the values for each group using t-tests. Results: After 2 weeks of drinking 10% ethanol with 0.4% saccharine, BACs were not significantly different [t(14)=0.2681, p=0.7935] between the VDM (81.56 {+/-} 21.16 mg/dL) vs.TT (73.14 {+/-} 23.20 mg/dL) groups. Calculated intake of ethanol (g/kg) on the day of blood draw for BAC analysis was also not significantly different [t(14)=0.4308, p=0.6732] between VDM (2.985{+/-} 0.4127) vs.TT (3.260 {+/-} 0.4863; Fig 1B) groups. Conclusions: Test tube or VDM resulted in similar average daily ethanol consumption and resultant BACs in female mice", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

While environmental risk factors for stereotypies are well documented, their developmental pathophysiology remains unclear. However, as previously found for compulsive behavior, there is growing evidence that REDOX imbalance may be linked to stereotypy. To examine the nature of this relationship, we first tested whether plasma glutathione level, the gold-standard biomarker of REDOX imbalance, is predictive of stereotypy severity in N=19 C57BL/6 mice. After confirming the presence of this relationship, we used a proteomics approach (Olink) to identify a broader biomarker profile of dysfunction. We found expression of 9 proteins to correlate with plasma glutathione level, and expression of 15 proteins to correlate with stereotypy severity. A subset of these proteins additionally correlated with stereotypy severity in a validation cohort of CD1 mice (N=28). Further supporting a role for REDOX imbalance in the developmental pathophysiology of stereotypies, the identified proteins were associated with REDOX physiology, dopamine physiology, and stereotypy-presenting human neurodevelopmental disorders. These data suggest REDOX imbalance may contribute to the developmental pathophysiology of abnormal repetitive behaviors and highlight promising novel targets for intervention.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

We examined the changes that occurred during serial passages of a reassortant H3N2 virus (VIC11pTRIG) containing human seasonal surface genes (Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase) and a swine-adapted internal gene constellation in differentiated primary swine tracheal epithelial cells (pSTECs). The VIC11pTRIG reassortant virus was serially passaged 8 times in pSTECs and compared to a control swine-adapted strain (OH/04p) containing the same internal gene constellation. Viral RNA from passages 0 (inoculum), 1, 3, 4-8 were sequenced via next generation or Sanger sequencing. Hemagglutinin diversity was highest at passage 3. Two amino acid mutations in the Hemagglutinin protein (N165K and N216K) were fixed at passages 7 and 5, respectively. These changes were associated with increased fitness of the virus in pSTECs compared to the original parental strain. Our results suggest that the adaptation of human seasonal H3N2 to swine cells may lead to the selection of HA mutations located near the receptor binding site.

The experiment was conducted for 537 days at a temperature of 30-32; and a pH of 8.0-9.0. The transformation from nitrite-anammox to nitrate-anammox was stably achieved on the 350th day. The experimental results showed that, nitrate directly oxidized ammonium into nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions. The produced gas consisted of 96.3% nitrogen and 3.7% carbon dioxide. The removal ratio of ammonium to nitrate was approximately 1.67:1, and the total inorganic nitrogen removal rate reached up to 290.20 mg/(L{middle dot}d). Unlike the nitrite-anammox reaction, this reaction was accompanied by an acid production process, which caused a decrease in pH. When the substrate was changed to nitrite and ammonium, the total nitrogen removal rate of only 1.1-1.3 mg/(L{middle dot}d) was achieved.

Spacer acquisition relies on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and accessory proteins like Cas4, which select DNA sequences flanked by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and insert them into the CRISPR array. It has been shown that in type II-A systems selection of PAM-proximal prespacers is mediated by the effector nuclease Cas9, which forms a 'supercomplex' with the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and the Csn2 protein. However, the supercomplex structure and the role of the ring-like Csn2 protein remain unknown.

Proteins involved in lipid metabolism, such as the monoacylglycerol lipase Rv0183, play critical roles during both the active and dormant phases of Mtb and present novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Through high-throughput screening at the European Lead Factory, we identified a novel chemotype characterized by a hydroxypyrrolidine ring, which demonstrated potent inhibition of Rv0183 and promising results in whole cell bacterial studies. Subsequent co-crystallization studies of this chemotype with Rv0183 revealed non-covalent interactions within the lipase's binding pocket, elucidating the inhibitory mechanism. Comparative analysis, augmented by AI-driven 3D-point-cloud approaches, distinguished Rv0183's ligand-binding cavity from that of human monoacylglycerol lipase, implying the possibility for species-selective inhibition. This selectivity was further supported by molecular docking simulations which validated the experimental binding affinities and predicted strong, specific binding modes. Our study presents not only the structural basis for the inhibition of Rv0183 by these novel hydroxypyrrolidine-based inhibitors but also demonstrates the utility of integrating computational and empirical methods to achieve species-specific targeting. This approach could minimize off-target effects in humans, marking a significant step toward developing more effective antitubercular therapies.

In this study, we introduce a novel computational frame for Modeling Protein Expression and Transport (MPET) that evaluates the contribution of ICT activity to differential surface protein expression using CITE-seq data. MPET comprises three modules for identification of ICT and surface protein regulatory circuits across biological scales and their contributions to phenotypic variation. We applied MPET to analyze single-cell data from COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity. Our analysis revealed context-dependent recruitment of ICT genes and pervasive rewiring of ICT pathways throughout the course of disease progression.

Iron is essential for maternal haematopoietic adaptations and placental processes such as mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly, heme synthesis, and erythropoiesis. This study aimed to characterise iron transport and downstream utilisation in FGR. Placental tissues from term uncomplicated (n=19) and FGR (n=18) pregnancies were analysed. Maternal iron status was retrospectively assessed from clinical records. Placental mRNA and protein expression of iron-dependent pathways were analysed via RT-qPCR, LC-MS, and Western blotting. Placental iron content was assessed histologically, and heme levels were measured by activity assay. FGR pregnancies showed significantly elevated maternal serum ferritin and lower red cell distribution width, although remained within normal clinical values. Placental iron uptake transporters TFRC and DMT1 were significantly upregulated, while the iron exporter to the fetus, ferroportin, was reduced, indicating increased iron retention in the FGR placenta. Despite altered transporter expression, Fe3 iron levels were unchanged, suggesting iron utilisation over storage. Subsequent investigations identified reduced mitochondrial Fe-S synthesis components (FDXR, FDX2, NDUFAB1, HSPA9), and a prioritisation of mitochondrial and cytosolic heme synthesis enzymes in FGR. Protein levels of haemoglobin subunits (HBG1, HBG2, HBB, HBA1) and erythrocyte membrane markers (EPB41, EPB42, SPTA1, SPTB, ANK1) were decreased.

Their carriage often corresponds with changes to the host transcriptome, but it is unknown during which stage of the conjugation process these transcriptional changes are initiated, and how gene transfer is modulated as they occur. This is because they are normally studied after their full acquisition by conjugation has already occurred, not during the process. Here, active RP4 conjugation revealed that the transcriptional response to plasmid acquisition is almost immediate and is host and surface factor dependent. Responses included activation of non-SOS stress pathways, motility, exopolysaccharide production, anaerobic respiration, and metabolic adaptation. These responses were not a barrier to conjugation, indicating that their significance relates to host homeostasis rather than gene transfer. The recipient could prevent these responses by blocking conjugation through capsule expression. RP4 expression was also inhibited by recipient capsule, since capsule physically blocked donor-recipient contact. Unexpectedly, within a population, RP4 was found to exploit single cell variation in recipient capsule thickness and to successfully conjugate with recipient bacteria with reduced capsule.

We investigated early metabolic markers of non-survival, and a potential microbial intervention using Bacteroides intestinalis-AM1, to improve outcomes in ALF. Method: Plasma metabolomics and meta-proteomics were performed in 40 ALF patients and 5 healthy controls (training cohort). A non-survival marker panel was identified and validated in 270 ALF patients (test cohort) using high resolution mass spectrometry and machine learning. It was functionally validated in acetaminophen-induced ALF mouse model. B. intestinalis-AM1 was used to study alteration of gut bacteria and amelioration of liver injury. Results: ALF non-survivors showed a distinct metabolomic signature with elevated primary bile acids {chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), cholic acid (CA)}, tryptophan, tyrosine, and enrichment of pathways linked to inflammation, cell death, and stress response (p<0.01, FDR<0.01, FC>1.5). Non-survivors had higher alpha/beta diversity (p<0.05) with increase in Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria (p<0.05); functionally associated with energy, amino acid and xenobiotic metabolism (p<0.05). A gut microbiota derangement in converting primary to secondary bile acids was evident as CDCA and cytotoxic metabolites (4-(2-Amino phenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate, L-Tyrosine) were higher. Elevated CDCA (logFC>10) levels correlated with mortality in ALF patients as well as in mouse model. In the later, administration of B. intestinalis-AM1 bacteria, (10^9) reduced CDCA and CA levels by enhancing FXR, FGF15, SLC10A1 gene expression, attenuating inflammation (IL-1beta, TLR4-signalling), necroptosis, and modulating glutathione(oxidative-repair), tryptophan(inflammation), and histidine (tissue repair) metabolism. Conclusion: High levels of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) represent a poor prognostic indicator in ALF patients.

However, there is also evidence that low levels of ppGpp contribute to resistance to certain cell wall-active antibiotics in actively growing cells. To characterize ppGpp's contribution to antibiotic resistance, we measured MICs of a panel of {beta}-lactams in actively growing Escherichia coli cells overexpressing a ppGpp synthase (relA*). Cells engineered to modestly overproduce ppGpp exhibited up to 64-fold increases in resistance to PBP2-targeting {beta}-lactams only, with mecillinam the most dramatically affected. Resistance required the transcription factor DksA and the class A penicillin binding protein (PBP) PBP1B. PBP1B variants defective for transpeptidase activity, glycosyltransferase activity, or both were incapable of mediating resistance, suggesting the full enzymatic activity of PBP1B is required for resistance. Transcriptomics revealed that ppGpp overproduction leads to increased expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. LpoB was required for mecillinam resistance, with an lpoB deletion mutant exhibiting a loss of ppGpp-dependent resistance. Resistance was partially lost in an lpoB deletion strain expressing an LpoB-bypass variant of PBP1B (mrcB*). Together these results support a model wherein overproduction of ppGpp favors cell wall synthesis by PBP1B, in part via increased expression of lpoB, allowing PBP1B to substitute for PBP2 when it is inhibited by {beta}-lactams.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Type II-A systems employ Cas9 for protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) recognition and coordinate with Csn2 and the Cas1-Cas2 integrase during spacer acquisition, yet their structural basis remains unresolved. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the Enterococcus faecalis Cas9-Csn2-Cas1-Cas2 supercomplex in apo and DNA-bound states. The apo-state structure (Cas92-Csn2-Cas1-Cas2) adopts a resting conformation, with Cas9 locked in a nuclease-inactive state and Cas1-Cas2 sterically blocked from prespacer loading. Upon DNA engagement, Cas9 undergoes a conformational transition, forming a prespacer catching complex that threads the DNA through Csn2's central channel. This architecture enables Cas9 to interrogate the PAM sequence while sliding along the DNA, with Cas9 and Csn2 jointly define a 30-bp DNA segment which matches the prespacer length. Subsequent dissociation of Cas9 triggers a structural reconfiguration of the Csn2-Cas1-Cas2 assembly. The PAM-proximal DNA becomes accessible, and Cas1-Cas2 relocates to bind to the exposed DNA, enabling further prespacer processing and directional integration. These findings reveal how Cas9 collaborates with Csn2 and Cas1-Cas2 to couple PAM recognition with prespacer selection, resolving the dynamic structural transitions that ensure fidelity during type II-A CRISPR adaptation.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

In modern landscape models, attractors represent cell types, and stochastic jumps and bifurcations drive cellular decisions, allowing for quantitative and predictive descriptions. However, given a biological problem of interest, we still lack tools to infer and build possible Waddington landscapes systematically. In this study, we propose a generative model for deriving epigenetic landscapes compatible with data. To build the landscapes, we combine gradient and rotational vector fields composed of locally weighted elements that encode `valleys' of the Waddington landscape, resulting in interpretable models. We optimize landscapes through computational evolution and illustrate our approach with two developmental examples: metazoan segmentation and neuromesoderm differentiation. In both cases, we obtain ensembles of solutions that reveal both known and novel landscapes in terms of topology and bifurcations. Conversely, topographic features appear strongly constrained by dynamical data, which suggests that our approach can generically derive interpretable and predictive epigenetic landscapes.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Theoretical studies predict two phases of phenotypic evolution: an initial directional phase, characterized by shifts in the mean of the trait towards a new optimum; and a subsequent stabilizing phase, in which the mean phenotype remains in equilibrium. However, there is limited empirical evidence to confirm these predictions. We exposed six replicate populations of Drosophila simulans, each with 100,000 individuals, to a new high-protein diet for 31 generations. Using time-series, high-order and molecular phenotypes, we characterized the phases of polygenic adaptation and inferred the transition between the directional and stabilizing selection phases empirically. The initial (directional) phase was characterized by a rapid phenotypic response, followed by a plateau after seven generations of adaptation, suggesting proximity to the new trait optimum (i.e. the stabilizing phase). The phenotypic responses were highly parallel among the replicate populations throughout the experiment. The contribution of pleiotropic loci to adaptive phenotypic evolution varied across the different phases of adaptation. Adaptation was facilitated by genes with low-to-intermediate pleiotropy whereas highly pleiotropic genes played a significant role in the rapid phase of adaptation. Parallel evolutionary responses across the replicate populations were also driven by genes with low-to-intermediate pleiotropy. Our findings support the predictions of theoretical models and is the first empirical inference of directional and stabilizing phases.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

This study evaluated the performance of micro-aeration-enhanced anaerobic digestion (MA-AD) for the treatment and valorization of CPW to promote a more sustainable approach to coffee production. Oxygen was intermittently introduced via oxidation-reduction potential-controlled dosing, allowing for comparative assessment across anaerobic and micro-aerobic redox regimes. While both conventional anaerobic digestion (AD) and MA-AD achieved comparable reductions in total and volatile solids (>48% and >60%, respectively) and total and soluble chemical oxygen demand (>66% and >86%, respectively), MA-AD exhibited significantly higher total suspended solids concentrations and turbidity in later phases, likely due to gas sparging-induced floc disruption and particulate release. pH profiles indicated a shift toward increased acidification under MA-AD, without compromising process stability, with both reactors stabilizing between pH 6.8 - 7.1. Caffeine degradation was accelerated under MA-AD in the first dosing phase (>85% removal in 28 h), though long-term degradation efficiency converged with the control. Methane production was consistently lower in MA-AD (up to 43% reduction), attributed to the oxygen sensitivity of methanogens and possible substrate competition. These results underscore the importance of oxygen dose regulation, redox control, and microbial adaptation in optimizing MA-AD performance. The findings support MA-AD as a promising strategy for enhancing hydrolysis and partial removal of recalcitrant compounds in CPW.

Particle-based hydrogels offer potential for engineering viscoelasticity through design of both the component microparticles and their processing into bulk particle-based materials. When particles are not crosslinked to one another, particle movements in response to strain can potentially relieve applied stresses and facilitate the material's use in dynamic processes like bioprinting. In particle-based hydrogels based on spherical hydrogel microparticles (HMPs), particle movement is restricted by contacts with immediately adjacent HMPs. In comparison, fiber-based hydrogel systems leverage high-aspect ratio microfiber components with long-range interactions. Here, microfibers with aspect ratios of ~15:1 length:diameter are used to form particle-based hydrogels to compare how interparticle interactions at increased length scales alter properties compared to particle-based hydrogels based on spherical HMPs. Like particle-based hydrogels formed from spherical HMPs, those formed from fiber HMPs exhibit viscoelasticity, with shear-thinning and self-healing behaviors. But, fiber-based materials allow enhanced control over bulk stress relaxation times (T1/2 ~ 1-100+ s) across a range of applied strains ({sigma} ~ 2.5-50%) in a packing density-dependent fashion. Fiber-based systems relaxed stresses continually and to a greater degree at low strains in comparison to HMP systems. Dynamic interfiber interactions in fiber-based hydrogels also supported embedded printing where perfusable channels can be printed into fiber-based hydrogels stabilized by physical interfiber interactions.

While granular hydrogels inherently exhibit these properties, they often lack post-injection stability. Here, we developed an electrostatically stabilized granular hydrogel system composed of norbornene-modified hyaluronic acid (NorHA) microgels and cationic gelatin ((+) Gel). NorHA microgels (9.91 +/- 4.85 m diameter) were synthesized via batch emulsification, while (+) Gel was prepared by modifying gelatin with ethylene diamine to increase zeta potential from 2.08 +/- 0.97 mV to 13.76 +/- 1.11 mV. The negatively charged NorHA microgels formed stable materials when combined with (+) Gel through electrostatic interactions, confirmed by gel inversion tests and salt sensitivity studies. Rheological characterization revealed that (+) Gel addition produced poroelastic behavior and strain-stiffening properties, with storage modulus and yield onset increasing under compression. Large amplitude oscillatory shear analysis showed strain-stiffening behavior (e3 > 0) that enhanced with both (+) Gel concentration and compression. Confocal microscopy demonstrated tunable porosity through gelatin fraction control, with (+) Gel forming aggregate-like clusters. Extrusion testing showed formulations required low injection pressures (0.47-0.91 kPa) comparable to PBS and significantly lower than Pluronic, while forming robust filaments up to 23 mm in length.

Thus, differences in a number of factors including: experimental design, data collection approaches, analysis methodologies, and interpretation decisions, make it challenging to confidently compare results derived from different studies, even those that were performed on the same organism. To assess the potential severity of these discrepancies, we used PIPETS, a statistically robust and genome-annotation agnostic 3'-seq analysis package, to study Escherichia coli 3'-seq data sets from three different groups collected under similar conditions. By using a consistent analysis and results interpretation approach, we identified large disparities in the characteristics of the raw 3'-seq data between each of the studies, despite all three studies using the same strain and very similar reported experimental conditions. Additionally, we found strand-specific inconsistencies, with some data sets having reference strand 3'-seq read coverage distributions that differed greatly from the complement strand within the same replicate. Finally, when the 3'-seq distribution profiles of the three E. coli studies are compared to studies from four additional bacteria, we identified 3'-seq results clustering patterns that are not explained by phylogenetic similarity between organisms.

We discovered that the activation of the {beta}3-adrenergic receptor drives running-induced fat loss and the lower leptin triggers energy compensation by upregulating Neuropeptide Y. Once energy compensation is achieved, running is associated with molecular changes in hypothalamic signaling related to appetite and functional adaptations, such as enhanced sensitivity to hunger and satiety signals and increased responsiveness to appetite suppression induced by -Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone.

Objective: We investigated how low-intensity TUS modulates membrane voltage dynamics in single cortical neurons in awake mice. Methods: Using the genetically encoded voltage indicator SomArchon, we performed high-speed kilohertz voltage imaging in awake head-fixed mice. TUS was delivered with a 0.35MHz transducer at 10 or 40Hz pulse repetition frequency with a 20% duty cycle, at intensities below the estimated threshold for auditory brainstem activation. We analyzed changes in membrane potential (Vm), spiking, and coordination across simultaneously recorded neurons. Results: TUS evoked rapid (<10ms) Vm depolarizations in 42.8% of neurons, while only 20.5% showed increased spiking, highlighting a direct effect of TUS on modulating synaptic inputs. Many neurons were entrained at both PRFs (20.8% at 10Hz; 12.7% at 40Hz) with Vm exhibiting significant phase-locking to individual TUS pulses. Vm entrainment was accompanied by increased temporal coordination across neurons and reset network synchrony. Furthermore, TUS-evoked cellular responses adapted over time, often transitioning from membrane depolarization to hyperpolarization upon repeated exposures, demonstrating prominent response depression. Conclusion: By resolving single-neuron responses, our results demonstrate that TUS directly activates individual cortical neuron with a latency shorter than 10 ms. TUS pulsed at physiologically relevant frequencies of 10 and 40 Hz robustly entrains neural dynamics, alters network coordination and evokes neuronal plasticity. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of designing TUS pulsing patterns to target specific neural circuit dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Entomological collections were carried out between January and February 2023 in five municipalities with confirmed viral circulation. Natural YFV infection was assessed using RT-LAMP. A total of 4,352 female culicids were collected, representing at least 32 species, including several key sylvatic YFV vectors. Haemagogus leucocelaenus was identified in all sampled municipalities, whereas Haemagogus janthinomys, the primary vector of sylvatic YFV in Brazil, was not detected. Mosquitoes from the genera Aedes, Haemagogus, Psorophora, and Sabethes were tested for YFV. Only one pool, composed of Sabethes albiprivus, tested positive, yielding a minimum infection rate (MIR) of 11.6. This is the first record of natural YFV infection in Sa. albiprivus in southern Brazil, and only the third reported case globally, highlighting its potential role as a secondary vector in maintaining viral circulation in sylvatic environments. Based on species presence and abundance, Hg. leucocelaenus is likely to have acted as the primary YFV vector in the study area. The composition of the culicid fauna, coupled with the detection of YFV in sylvatic vectors, indicates an ongoing epidemiological risk.

CRISPR-Cas systems are known to be important regulators of these host-MGE interactions, but a global understanding of CRISPR-Cas diversity, activity, and roles across Earth's biomes is still lacking. Here, we use an optimized computational approach to search short-read data and collect ~800 million CRISPR spacers across ~450,000 public metagenomes. Comparing spacers across samples and taxa revealed a high population diversity for CRISPR loci overall, with typically only a small subset of spacers detected as prevalent and conserved within a microbial population. From this extensive CRISPR spacer dataset, we identified 1.18 billion hits between 41 million spacers and 2.5 million viruses and plasmids. Prevalent and conserved spacers were over-represented in these MGE-matching spacers, and CRISPR spacers frequently matched multiple MGEs, consistent with a positive selection pressure associated with MGE targeting. Focusing on the role of CRISPR as anti-phage defense, we observed surprising cases of viruses targeted by microbes not expected to be viable hosts. These were more frequent for viruses encoding a diversification mechanism (DGR) for their host attachment proteins, and associated with a reduced rate of escape mutations. This suggests that broad spacer targeting may derive from the recurring entry of a virus genome into a non-host microbial cell, leading to some viruses being targeted by taxonomically diverse microbes well outside of their actual host range. Taken together, this petabase-scale exploration of CRISPR arrays in nature outlines the extensive diversity of CRISPR array loci across microbiomes. It highlights several key genomic and ecological parameters driving the activity of CRISPR arrays that are likely influencing strain-level diversification and selection processes within microbial populations.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

Whereas many bacterial species have now been linked to a variety of different diseases, the involvement of Archaea in human disease remains elusive. Here we searched for gut archaeal signatures of disease by screening 19 cross-sectional clinical studies comprising more than 1,800 individuals. We found that associations between Archaea and medical disorders are common but highly variable and are dominated by a significant increase of Methanobrevibacter smithii in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Metabolic modelling and in vitro co-culture identified distinct mutualistic interactions of M. smithii with CRC-causing bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, including metabolic enhancement. Metabolomics further revealed archaeal-derived compounds with tumor-modulating properties. This provides the first mechanistic link between human gut archaeome and CRC and highlights its role in modulating health in humans through trophic control of the resident bacteriome.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "The cellular proteome represents a mixture of older and newer copies of each protein type and turnover of this mixture occurs by cycles of protein synthesis and degradation. There is considerable research on new protein synthesis, the nature of nascent proteins and cellular machinery of protein degradation. However, we have limited insights into older proteins or the protein aging process in plants at scale. In this study we use pulse chase biorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) in Arabidopsis cells coupled to affinity purification to capture and analyse snapshots of the cellular proteome as it ages over a two-week period. Each snapshot was subjected to peptide mass spectrometry-based identification, quantitation and characterisation. We show that there are a broad range of lifespans among the 1688 proteins studied and that their subcellular location correlates strongly with protein longevity. Mitochondria, plastids and the extracellular environment contained the longest lived sub-proteomes while the vesicular pathway to ER, PM and peroxisomes contained the shortest-lived protein sets. Abundant primary metabolic enzymes have considerable longevity, while kinases and ubiquitination machinery do not. Through analysis of the aging profiles, we demonstrate that many proteins selectively accumulate posttranslational modifications (PTMs) as they age and that these are mostly oxidative in nature. We show by analysis of exemplar proteins that distinct PTM profiles and proportional changes with age exist between proteins, likely dictated by differences in subcellular environment and protein function. Implications of these insights for understanding cellular function and for biotechnological modification of the plant proteome are discussed.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

T.; von Bachmann, A.-L.; Hovsepyan, A.; Griebl, M.-L.; Wolf, B.; Lemmen, N.; Kroell, A.-S.; Westermann, S.; Mathony, J.; Niopek, D.", "abstract": "Allostery, the transmission of locally induced conformational changes to distant functional sites, is a key mechanism for protein regulation. Artificial allosteric effectors enable remote manipulation of cell function; their engineering, however, is hampered by our limited understanding of allosteric residue networks. Here, we introduce a phage-assisted evolution platform for in vivo optimization of allosteric proteins. It applies opposing selection pressures to enhance activity and switchability of phage-encoded effectors and leverages retron-based recombineering to broadly explore fitness landscapes, covering point mutations, insertions and deletions. Applying our pipeline to the transcription factor AraC yielded optogenetic variants with light-controlled activity spanning ~1000-fold dynamic range. Long-read sequencing across selection cycles revealed adaptive trajectories and corresponding allosteric interactions. Our work facilitates phage-assisted evolution of allosteric proteins for programmable cellular control.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}

C.; Sach, L.; Hakus, A.; Oektem, S. K.; Bergmann, R.; Voigt, A.; Schmitz, D.; Poirazi, P.; Larkum, M. E.; Sachdev, R.", "abstract": "Behavioral responses to threats - such as fleeing, freezing, or fighting - can be either innate or shaped by learning and context. Here, we investigated whether mice exhibit fear of predators across four experimental contexts: one in a novel head-fixed condition and three in established, freely moving scenarios. In head-fixed mice, we measured the behavioral outcome and response to a live rat. Mice were water-deprived and habituated to walk on a treadmill that controlled a virtual environment and reward delivery. After meeting performance criteria, baseline data were collected in one session, followed by a test session in which the mice were exposed to a live rat. Despite the presence of the predator, most (5 out of 7) mice continued to forage at baseline levels; however, individual mice showed significant alterations in one or more of the following measures: running speed, pupil size, eye movement, and posture. To assess how behavioral context and physical restraint influence predator responses, we exposed 36 naive, freely moving mice to fear-inducing stimuli - including looming visual cues, rat odor, and a live rat. Even in these conditions, a substantial proportion of mice failed to exhibit classical defensive responses such as avoidance or escape. Notably, when presented with a freely moving rat, only about half of the mice displayed avoidance behavior. Together, these findings suggest that mice do not universally express innate fear behaviors such as avoidance or fleeing, even in ethologically relevant predator encounters. Instead, their responses appear to be context-dependent and variable, challenging common assumptions about automatic defensive reactions in rodents.", "date": "2025-06-12", "journal": ""}
