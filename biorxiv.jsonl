M.", "abstract": "In recent years, the cognitive neuroscience literature has come under criticism for containing many low-powered studies, limiting the ability to make reliable statistical inferences. Typically, the suggestion for increasing power is to collect more data with neural signals. However, many studies in cognitive neuroscience use parameters estimated from behavioral data in order to make inferences about neural signals (such as fMRI BOLD signal). In this paper, we explore how cognitive neuroscientists can learn more about their neuroimaging signal by collecting data on behavior alone. We demonstrate through simulation that knowing more about the marginal distribution of behavioral parameters can improve inferences about the mapping between cognitive processes and neural data. In realistic settings of the correlation between cognitive and neural parameters, additional behavioral data can lead to the same improvement in the precision of inferences more cheaply and easily than collecting additional data from subjects in a neuroimaging study. This means that when conducting a neuroimaging study, researchers now have two knobs to turn in a design analysis: the number of subjects collected in the scanner and the number of behavioral subjects collected outside the scanner (in the lab or online).", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

To investigate the genomic basis of the phylogenetic plasticity in brain Oxtr expression and its social behavioral consequences, we generated transgenic mice carrying a bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) harboring the entire prairie vole Oxtr locus and flanking intergenic regulatory regions. We established eight independent volized mouse lines expressing prairie vole Oxtr (pvOxtr). Strikingly, despite conserved Oxtr expression in mammary gland of all transgenic mouse lines, each line displayed a unique pattern of brain expression distinct from both mice and prairie voles. Together with topologically associating domain (TAD) structure analysis with mouse genome, our findings suggest that unlike Oxt, Oxtr expression patterns in brain, involve contributions of distal regulatory elements beyond the BAC insert. In contrast, Oxtr expression in peripheral tissues appears resistant to such distal influences. Moreover, the volized mouse lines with different brain Oxtr expression patterns showed differences in partner preference and maternal behaviors, providing direct functional evidence that variation in brain Oxtr expression can drive differences in social behaviors. We propose that brain Oxtr expression is transcriptionally sensitive to long-range interactions with distal genomic elements, rendering it more susceptible to diverse regulatory influences. This supports a model in which regulatory flexibility facilitates the evolutionary diversification of social behavior, while maintaining essential peripheral Oxtr expression.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

However, achieving these lower frequencies has remained a significant technical and financial challenge. Here, we present a compact, cost-effective resonant electro-optic modulator that halves the laser repetition rate to 40 MHz. When imaging neurons in macaque visual cortex in vivo, this 40 MHz configuration yeilded a > 2- fold increase in fluorescence intensity and a ~3 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This enhancement proved particularly pronounced in deep-tissue imaging. Furthermore, the system demonstrated excellent long-term stability and induced no detectable phototoxicity. This simple and robust device represents a powerful upgrade for conventional two-photon microscopes, significantly enhancing imaging quality for the investigation of neural circuits within scattering brain tissue.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Impaired mitochondrial transport in the axon is another feature of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Using Drosophila, we found that genetic depletion of axonal mitochondria causes dysregulation of protein degradation. Axons with mitochondrial depletion showed abnormal protein accumulation and autophagic defects. Lowering neuronal ATP levels by blocking glycolysis did not reduce autophagy, suggesting that autophagic defects are associated with mitochondrial distribution. We found that eIF2beta was increased by the depletion of axonal mitochondria via proteome analysis. Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha, another subunit of eIF2, was lowered, and global translation was suppressed. Neuronal overexpression of eIF2beta phenocopied the autophagic defects and neuronal dysfunctions, and lowering eIF2beta expression rescued those perturbations caused by depletion of axonal mitochondria. These results indicate the mitochondria-eIF2beta axis maintains proteostasis in the axon, of which disruption may underly the onset and progression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Drawing on data from an extensive array of reaching tasks conducted over the past 30 years, we evaluated the merits of various computational models regarding the origin of motor biases. Contrary to previous theories, we show that motor biases do not arise from systematic errors associated with the sensed hand position during motor planning or from the biomechanical constraints imposed during motor execution. Rather, motor biases are primarily caused by a misalignment between eye-centric and body-centric representations of position. This model can account for motor biases across a wide range of contexts, encompassing movements with the right versus left hand, finger versus hand movements, visible and occluded starting positions, as well as before and after sensorimotor adaptation.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Utilizing an alignment-free variant detection framework, ntRoot employs a succinct Bloom filter data structure to efficiently query diverse genomic data inputs. Demonstrated on over 600 human genome sequencing datasets, including complete genomes, draft assemblies, and over 280 independently-generated datasets, ntRoot accurately predicts geographic labels, a descriptor of human populations, and shows high concordance with traditional methods such as ADMIXTURE (R2 = 0.9567) when predicting ancestry fractions. It achieves these predictions within 30 minutes for complete and draft genomes and within 1 hour and 15 minutes for 30X sequencing data, using a maximum of 13GB and 68GB of RAM, respectively. ntRoot offers both global and local ancestry inference, delivering high-resolution predictions across genomic loci.

Signaling of the constitutively active KRAS oncogenic mutants is mostly compartmentalized to proteolipid nanoclusters on the plasma membrane (PM). Signaling nanoclusters of many KRAS mutants selectively enrich phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids with unsaturated sn-2 acyl chains, but not the fully saturated PS species. Thus, remodeling PS acyl chains may suppress KRAS oncogenesis. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases (LPCATs) remodel sn-2 acyl chains of phospholipids, with LPCAT1 preferentially generating the fully saturated lipids. Here, we show that stable expression of LPCAT1 depletes major PS species with unsaturated sn-2 chains while decreasing minor phosphatidylcholine (PC) species with the corresponding acyl chains. LPCAT1 expression more effectively disrupts the nanoclustering of oncogenic GFP-KRASG12V, which is restored by acute addback of exogenous unsaturated PS. LPCAT1 expression compromises signaling and oncogenic activities of the KRAS-dependent pancreatic tumor lines. LPCAT1 expression sensitizes human pancreatic tumor MiaPaCa-2 cells to KRASG12C specific inhibitor, Sotorasib. Statistical analyses of patient data further reveal that pancreatic cancer patients with KRAS mutations express less LPCAT1. Higher LPCAT1 expression also improves survival probability of pancreatic and lung adenocarcinoma patients with KRAS mutations.

While it is well understood that larger samples are preferable, researchers often need to interpret findings from small studies (e.g., when reviewing the literature, analyzing pilot data, or assessing subsamples). However, quantitative guidance for making these judgments remains scarce. To address this gap, we leverage the UK Biobank and the Human Connectome Project's Young Adult dataset to survey a range of standard task-based fMRI analyses, from obtaining regional activation maps to performing predictive modeling. These analyses are repeated using volumetric and two types of cortical surface data. For classic mass-univariate analyses (e.g., regional activation detection or cluster peak localization), studies with as few as 40 participants can be adequate depending on the effect size. For predictive modeling, similar sample sizes can be used to detect whether a feature is predictable, but developing stable, generalizable models typically requires cohorts at least an order of magnitude larger, and possibly two (hundreds or thousands). Together, these results clarify how reliability depends on the interplay of effect size, sample size, and analysis type, offering practical guidance for designing and interpreting small-scale task-fMRI studies.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Social behaviors are translationally relevant, considering both mice and humans are highly social mammals, and human social behavior disruptions are key symptoms of myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. Stresses related to social experiences are particularly influential in the severity and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders like anxiety disorders, and trauma and stressor-related disorders. Yet, induction and study of social stress in mice has disproportionately focused on males, influenced heavily by their inherent territorial nature. Social target-instigated stress (i.e., defeat), while ethologically relevant, is quite variable and predominantly specific to males, making rigorous and sex-inclusive studies challenging. In pursuit of a controllable, consistent, high throughput, and sex-inclusive method for social stress elicitation, we modified a paradigm to train male and female F1 129S1/SvlmJ x C57BL/6J mice to associate (via classical conditioning) same or different sex C57BL/6J targets with a mild, aversive stimulus. While further paradigm optimization is required, social interaction testing 24 h after conditioning indicates males socially conditioned better to male targets by exhibiting reduced social interaction, whereas females appeared not to form social stimulus associations. Serum corticosterone levels inversely corresponded to social avoidance after different sex, but not same sex, conditioning, suggesting corticosterone-mediated arousal influences cross-sex interactions. These rigorously controlled null outcomes align with past pursuits' limited success in creating a sex-inclusive social stress paradigm.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

This study builds upon initial in vitro investigations of the functional impacts of this variant in the SYTANLAAF domain of the GluN1 M3 helix and examines its in vivo consequences in a mouse model. To investigate in vitro functional impacts of NMDARs containing GluN1-Y647S variant subunits, GluN1-Y647S was co-expressed with wildtype GluN2A or GluN2B subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK cells. Grin1Y647S/+ mice were created by CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease-mediated transgenesis and the molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioural consequences of the variant were examined. Additionally, de-identified patient data were collected to examine the representative nature of Grin1Y647S/+ mice in modelling specific aspects of patient symptomology. In vitro, NMDARs containing GluN1-Y647S showed altered sensitivity to endogenous agonists and negative allosteric modulators, and reduced cell surface trafficking. Ex vivo, Grin1Y647S/+ mice displayed a reduction in whole brain GluN1 levels and a deficiency in NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Behaviourally, Grin1Y647S/+ mice exhibited altered vocalizations, muscle strength, sociability, and problem-solving, as well as spontaneous convulsions that were ameliorated with supplementation of {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), an endogenously produced ketone body. The Y647S variant confers a complex in vivo phenotype, which reflects largely diminished properties of NMDAR function. As a result, Grin1Y647S/+ mice display atypical behaviour in domains relevant to the clinical characteristics of GRIN1-NDD and the individual carrying the variant, which allowed for the identification of BHB supplementation as a potential anti-convulsant treatment. Ultimately, the characterization of Grin1Y647S/+ mice accomplished in the present work, expands our understanding of the mechanisms underlying GRIN1-NDD and provides a foundation for the continued development of novel therapeutics.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Gene Ontology enrichment of target genes indicated both shared and specialized functions among AtSPLs, including roles in hormone signaling, metal ion homeostasis, and developmental transitions. Comparative analysis of closely related paralogs, AtSPL9 and AtSPL15, uncovered divergence in DNA-binding specificity and target gene regulation, particularly in auxin and abscisic acid pathways. We validated these differences using protoplast reporter assays and motif discovery. Extending our study across species, we analyzed DAP-seq data from maize (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) SPL homologs, identifying conserved target genes but species-specific DNA motifs. Notably, wheat SPLs preferentially bind to longer, palindromic motifs distinct from the GTAC core motif in Arabidopsis. Using AlphaFold3 structure modeling, we show that these motif differences may arise from enhanced protein-protein interactions that stabilize dimeric binding. Our results highlight how SPL family members diversify through DNA-binding evolution and suggest that transcription factor dimerization contributes to motif complexity and regulatory specialization across plant genomes.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate genetic adaptation in the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii using novel genomic resources and statistical methods. We used a newly developed chromosome-level genome assembly and data from 37 populations, combining publicly available and newly generated pooled and individual sequencing data, analyzed with an enhanced version of BayPass software, tailored for such hybrid datasets.

This provides information about both demographic and adaptive processes acting on the population during that period. A common approach to analyze such data is to model observed allele counts in finite samples using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) where hidden states are true allele frequencies over time (i.e. a trajectory). The HMM framework allows to compute the full likelihood of the data, while accounting both for the stochastic evolution of population allele frequencies along time and for the noise arising from sampling a limited number of individuals at possibly spread out generations. Several such HMM methods have been proposed so far, differing mainly in the way they model the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. Following Paris et al.

To facilitate the analysis and exploitation of genomic time series data, we present an improved version of Paris et al.

M.; Singh, A.; Scott, A.; Kulkarni, S.", "abstract": "Stress is a key contributor to gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility, particularly in patients with disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBI). Since GI motility is governed by the enteric nervous system (ENS), stress may act by altering ENS function. While stress activates glucocorticoid signaling via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the impact of stress-mediated glucocorticoid signaling on ENS biology remains poorly understood. In the central nervous system, glucocorticoids reduce specific isoforms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), impairing signaling through its receptor, TrkB, and contributing to behavioral dysfunction. However, the identity of ENS-specific Bdnf isoforms, their glucocorticoid sensitivity, and the effect of enhanced TrkB signaling on GI motility in stressed animals has not been characterized. Here, using male and female mice, we show that >85% of post-natal ENS Bdnf transcripts are glucocorticoid-responsive isoforms. We also demonstrate that both Bdnf and its receptor Ntrk2 (TrkB) are expressed by enteric neurons. In male mice, stress and administration of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist cause GI dysmotility, which we demonstrate is associated with significantly reduced Bdnf transcripts in the longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus (LMMP) tissue in vivo. Dexamethasone exposure also represses Bdnf transcript and mature protein levels in LM-MP tissue in vitro. Notably, treatment with HIOC, a selective TrkB agonist, rescues GI transit defects in dexamethasone-treated animals. These findings identify BDNF-TrkB signaling as a key modulator of stress-induced ENS dysfunction and highlight TrkB as a promising therapeutic target for GI dysmotility in DGBI.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Here, using metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) studied using the CNBio PhysioMimix as a case study, we developed a machine learning framework called Latent In Vitro to In Vivo Translation (LIV2TRANS) to ascertain how MPS data map to in vivo data, first sharpening translation insights and consequently elucidating experimental conditions that can further enhance translation capability. Our findings in this case study highlight TGF{beta} as a crucial cue for MPS translatability and indicate that adding JAK-STAT pathway perturbations via interferon stimuli could increase the predictive performance of this MPS in MAFLD studies.

Importantly, however, these changes are predictable from the 3D structure of the surrounding scene. In two fMRI studies, we find that visual cortex dynamically updates object representations using this predictive contextual information. Firstly, visual cortical representations of objects were enhanced when they rotated congruently (versus incongruently) with the surrounding scene. Secondly, the inferred orientation of the object could be decoded from visual cortex activity even when the object was fully occluded. These findings indicate that predictive processes in visual cortex follow the geometric structure of the environment, providing a mechanism to support object perception in dynamic natural vision.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

However, a functional space remains elusive for understanding this inside-outside organization in the primate cortex. Here, we leverage comparative fMRI analysis to identify three conserved and reproducible functional connectivity gradients as three axes of manifold (FMA), which span a low-dimensional organizational space of wakeful primate connectomes. In humans, the primary FMA covers a sensorimotor-to-transmodal gradient that supports signal detection for allostatic anticipation. The second FMA mirrors a representation-to-modulation gradient that integrates attention and performance monitoring to compute prediction errors. The third FMA profiles a self-to-goal gradient that links salience processing and episodic memory to update brain prediction by weighting errors and contextual relevance. Marmosets exhibit a homologous tripartite structure, suggesting evolutionary conservation of predictive coding motifs, albeit with species-specific topological variations. These findings unify predictive coding, allostasis, and intrinsic activity into a signal-error-salience predictive modeling framework, where sensory integration, error computation, and salience modulation interact to optimize adaptive responses. By bridging neurocomputational theory with empirical connectomics, this work establishes a cross-species blueprint of brain organization, offering experimental evidence or insights into conserved mechanisms of free energy principles and dark energy explorations.

This study examines the relationship between urban vegetation and the presence and abundance of Aedes albopictus in Montpellier, the second greenest city of France, while accounting for meteorology, microclimate, air quality, human socio-demography, and landscape. From May to October 2023, adult mosquitoes were collected monthly in urban parks, residential areas, and the highly impervious city center using BG-Pro traps with odor and CO2 attractants. Microclimate data (air temperature and relative humidity) were recorded on-site at each trap location using Hygrobutton data-loggers. Vegetation, land cover, meteorological, air quality, and human demographic data were gathered from open-access databases. Ae. albopictus presence and abundance were analysed according to environmental variables taken at different time lags and spatial distances using a two-stage modeling approach: bivariate analyses using generalized linear mixed models were conducted to select variables for inclusion in a multivariate random forest model, aiming to identify the factors that best explain Ae. albopictus presence and abundance. While urban vegetation had a limited effect on Ae. albopictus presence, the average patch size, and the percentage of area covered by low vegetation were among the most important predictors of abundance. The main predictors for presence were minimum hourly temperature (24h-48h before sampling), minimum atmospheric pressure during sampling, and the weekly cumulated rainfall recorded six weeks before sampling. The most important predictors of abundance were the average patch size of low vegetation, the maximum hourly temperatures during sampling, and the length of roads. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining urban vegetation influence on Ae. albopictus in France, offering insights for urban planning and suggesting further research on vegetation role in mosquito-borne disease transmission, particularly in the context of increasing dengue incidence in Europe.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Prey species use proactive responses, such as site selection and the adjustment of daily activity patterns to anticipate and avoid predation exposure. In contrast, reactive responses, including fleeing, referential signaling and retaliation, occur after encountering a predator to mitigate the immediate predation risk. The presence of a predator in an area can also generate longer-term responses such as reactive avoidance, defined here as the temporary avoidance of the area following the passage of a predator. Such a long-term reactive response remains understudied in primates. To investigate reactive avoidance, we analyzed an extensive camera trap dataset of more than 3,000 detections of both chacma (Papio ursinus) and olive (Papio anubis) baboons, including almost 7,000 detections of their main predators, lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), in four savanna sites (Madikwe Game Reserve, Tswalu Kalahari Private Wildlife Reserve and the Associated Private Nature Reserves, South Africa; Serengeti National Park, Tanzania). We examined whether baboons display species-specific reactive avoidance towards predators up to 72 hours after the detection of a predator using randomization tests. We found no significant decrease in baboon presence (defined as the number of baboon detections) 0 to 24 hours, 24 to 48 hours and 48 to 72 hours after the detection of any predator species.

To detoxify excess heme, parasites form hemozoin crystals that rapidly tumble inside this compartment. Hemozoin formation is critical for parasite survival and central to antimalarial drug activity. Although the static structural properties of hemozoin have been extensively investigated, crystal motion and its underlying mechanism have remained puzzling. We used quantitative image analysis to determine the timescale of motion, which requires the intact vacuole but does not require the parasite itself. Using single particle tracking and Brownian dynamics simulations with experimentally derived interaction potentials, we found that hemozoin motion exhibits unexpectedly tight confinement but is much faster than thermal diffusion. Hydrogen peroxide, which is generated at high levels in the food vacuole, has been shown to stimulate the motion of synthetic metallic nanoparticles via surface-catalyzed peroxide decomposition that generates propulsive kinetic energy. We observed that peroxide stimulated the motion of isolated crystals in solution and that conditions that suppress peroxide formation slowed hemozoin motion inside parasites. These data suggest that surface-exposed metals on hemozoin catalyze peroxide decomposition to drive crystal motion. This work reveals hemozoin motion in malaria parasites as a biological example of an endogenous self- propelled nanoparticle. This mechanism of propulsion likely serves a physiological role to reduce oxidative stress to parasites from hydrogen peroxide produced by large-scale hemoglobin digestion during blood-stage infection.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

To resolve the debate, we studied twelve taikonauts aboard the China Space Station performing a classical hand-reaching task. Compared to their pre-flight performance and to an age-matched control group, participants showed increased movement durations and altered kinematic profiles in microgravity. Model-based analyses of motor control parameters revealed that these changes stemmed from reduced initial force generation in the feedforward control phase followed by compensatory feedback-based corrections. These findings support the body mass underestimation hypothesis while refuting the strategic slowing hypothesis.

Mirroring some well characterized effects of gestational challenges in rodents, maternal immune activation (MIA) during the lactational period disrupts maternal physiology, decreases lipid content, and is associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring. This occurs without MIA significantly affecting maternal care. While gestational MIA models are responsive to environmental interventions, which beneficially alter maternal milk composition and associated offspring outcomes, the bioactive mediators in milk underlying resilience remain poorly understood. Milk-derived extracellular vesicles (MEVs) transport and deposit biologically active cargo, including microRNAs (miRNAs) that induce post-translational regulation of candidate mRNA in the tissues and cells of nursing offspring. Using a rat model, we show that lactational MIA alters MEV-miRNA cargo and the expression of miRNAs in offspring hippocampus. Several miRNAs in MEVs were also found in the hippocampus of matching offspring. Remarkably, the miRNA changes in MEVs and the neonatal hippocampus were rescued when dams were raised in an enriched environment, suggesting environmental enrichment protected from the effects of MIA. This was supported by the behavioral phenotype. RNA-seq of adult offspring hippocampus showed long-term transcriptional changes associated with the gene targets of early-life regulated miRNAs. Our results position MEV-miRNA as dynamic programming signals by which maternal experience is communicated to offspring, encoding both stress-induced and protective cues that influence development.

Using these characteristics to assess the information transmitted through the network for multiple stimuli reveals a trade-off in coding space: increasing the number of stimuli conveys more information but also reduces their separability due to their larger overlap in the finite-dimensional neuronal space. Our analysis predicts that, only for the experimentally observed small population activity, information keeps increasing with the number of stimuli, revealing another crucial advantage of sparse coding.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

In this in vivo cut'n'paste procedure, \"cutting\" is executed by the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 and a set of guides, while \"pasting\" is facilitated by the phage {lambda} Red recombinase, which are all synthesized on easily curable helper plasmids. To demonstrate the utility of in vivo cut'n'paste, we commercially obtained synthetic DNA fragments containing locus-specific homology regions, antibiotic marker cassettes, and standardized Cas9 target sequences, and successfully relocated seven functional chromosomal loci. Scarless relocation mutants of the trg, aer, tsr, malHM, malQT, macB-nadA, and folA chromosomal loci were obtained as antibiotic-resistant isolates by combining Cas9 counterselection with the restoration of an antibiotic marker cassette. The additional antibiotic marker cassettes and standardized Cas9 target sequences present in the synthetic DNA fragments are inherently eliminated upon completion of the procedure, enabling iterative processing of chromosomal loci. In vivo cut'n'paste should be widely useful, especially in genome (re-)engineering efforts of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be performed by non-specialists in unmodified wild-type cells.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Using fMRI and computational modeling, we investigated the neural correlates of error-driven and uncertainty-driven boundaries. We developed computational models that generate boundaries based on prediction error or prediction uncertainty, and examined how both types of boundaries, and human-identified boundaries, related to fMRI pattern shifts and evoked responses. Multivariate analysis revealed a specific temporal sequence of neural pattern changes around human boundaries: early pattern shifts in anterior temporal regions (-11.9s), followed by shifts in parietal areas (-4.5s), and subsequent whole-brain pattern stabilization (+11.8s). The core of this dynamic response was associated with both error-driven and uncertainty-driven boundaries. Critically, both error- and uncertainty-driven boundaries were associated with unique pattern shifts. Error-driven boundaries were associated with early pattern shifts in ventrolateral prefrontal areas, followed by pattern stabilization in prefrontal and temporal areas. Uncertainty-driven boundaries were linked to shifts in parietal regions within the dorsal attention network, with minimal subsequent stabilization. In addition, within the core regions responsive to both types of boundaries, the timing differed significantly.

First, using a variety of genomic approaches, we establish that BAF collaborates with PU.1 to regulate transcription in AML cells. Then, using a combination of biochemistry and biophysics, mass spectrometry-based protein footprinting, and crystallography, we map the PU.1-BAF60A interface to a disordered region of PU.1 that adopts a helical conformation upon binding to the YEATS-like domain of BAF60A. Disruption of this functionally critical interface via knockdown abrogates the ability of PU.1 to rescue cell viability.

Co-crystal structures reveal distinct compound binding modes that converge on a critical PU.1-BAF60A interaction hotspot.

While some of these partly reinvest in research and dissemination and can be considered academia-friendly, non-profit journals - those that fully reinvest revenue into the academic community - often struggle for visibility despite promoting more equitable publishing models. Using citation data from over 70,000 publications in ecology and evolution, we show that citation practices are siloed: for-profit journals disproportionately cite other for-profit journals, academia-friendly journals preferentially cite other academia-friendly journals, and non-profit journals likewise favor citations to non-profit sources. This asymmetry structurally reinforces the IF advantage of for-profit journals simply because they are dominant in the publishing system. To address this inequity, we propose a soft-power, low-risk approach of 'strategic citation'. By deliberately choosing to cite relevant articles from non-profit journals when multiple references would be equally valid, researchers can contribute to increasing those journals' visibility and IF. This approach preserves scientific rigor and does not restrict publishing choices, but adds a layer of ethical intentionality to citation practices.

Extant studies, however, have confounded the physical characteristics of remembered stimuli with their behavioral relevance, i.e., meaning. Here, we report that human oculomotor behaviors track the behavioral relevance of remembered stimuli independent of their physical characteristics. We tracked participants eye movements while they categorized stimuli according to a learned rule and found that category membership could be robustly decoded from subtle variations in eye movement direction, frequency, and size. Category decoding performance was reliably greater during correct trials and could not be explained by manual response preparation or attention to stimulus features.

Moreover, extending refolding time to many seconds does not obstruct the appearance of metastable states.

From there we measured the individual folding trajectories of single molecules of CsgA using force spectroscopy by optical tweezers. This work exploits an engineered disulfide trap in the protein, where native folding becomes possible after reduction of the cysteine substitutions.

Most studies investigating laminar origins of alpha oscillations have been conducted on animals using invasive intracranial recordings. To relate these findings to human alpha generation, non-invasive techniques need to be developed. Layer functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high field (UHF, 7T) allows for the interrogation of brain responses across cortical depths and combined with simultaneous EEG, provides the opportunity to gain new insight into human alpha generation mechanisms. This work establishes a framework to study the generating mechanisms of electrophysiological signals non-invasively in humans using simultaneous EEG layer-fMRI. Data were acquired on 10 participants during an eyes closed/eyes open paradigm. We showed that in 9/10 participants the quality of EEG and Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI data were sufficient to observe a significant negative correlation between EEG alpha power and the BOLD signal in visual cortex grey matter to the eyes open/eyes closed task. \"Deveining\" was performed to overcome the increase in BOLD signal toward the pial surface due to draining veins, and the effects of each of the steps in the deveining analysis on the cortical depth profiles of the negative alpha-BOLD correlations studied. The largest effect was dependent on the exclusion of voxels in the tissue immediately surrounding veins. Following deveining, the cortical depth profiles showed the negative alpha-BOLD correlations were significantly weaker in the middle depths compared with deep and superficial depths. When a boxcar rather than EEG alpha power was used to model the task, this depth-dependence was not seen, suggesting this was specific to spontaneous alpha-power modulations. In conclusion, we have established a method to non-invasively interrogate the origins of electrophysiological signals.

In taste transduction, bitter compounds activate bitter taste receptors (T2Rs), a group of G protein-coupled receptors with downstream signaling that includes cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) release. T2Rs are expressed in HNSCC cells, where their activation induces apoptosis in vitro. Increased T2R expression in HNSCC also correlates with improved patient survival. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of quercetin as an anticancer T2R agonist in HNSCC cells in vitro and ex vivo. Methods: Quercetin-mediated Ca2+ responses were assessed using live cell Ca2+ imaging in the presence of the T2R14 antagonist LF1 and G-protein inhibitor YM-254980 (YM) in UM-SCC-47 and FaDu HNSCC cell lines. Cell viability was evaluated using crystal violet assays in cell lines and MTS assays in patient-derived tumor slices. Mitochondrial depolarization was measured with TMRE in the presence and absence of T2R pathway inhibitors. Results: Quercetin induced a Ca2+ response in HNSCC cells, which was significantly reduced by LF1 and YM. Quercetin also decreased cell viability in vitro and showed a potential decrease in viability in tumor slices but was not statistically significant. Finally, quercetin caused mitochondrial depolarization, which was reduced in the presence of LF1 but not by YM. Conclusions: In HNSCC cells, quercetin causes a Ca2+ response that is likely mediated by T2R14, decreases viability, and causes mitochondrial depolarization.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Of the 19 complete plasmid genomes, one was reconstructed from an Escherichia coli isolate; others were linked to species of Citrobacter and Enterobacter via analysis of genome modification patterns. The detection of related plasmids in different Enterobacteriaceae, conjugation machinery, and more diverse modified motifs in certain plasmids compared to hosts suggests that these elements are self-transmissible, with a broad host range. The plasmids encode multi-drug efflux systems and potential secreted effectors. Up to 208 tRNAs are encoded, and include sequence variants that may counter tRNA-centric defense mechanisms. Overall, the vast megaplasmid coding capacity may broaden host range, increase competitiveness, control invasion by other elements, and counter programmed cell death.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Well documented in the literature is the extensive histaminergic axonal innervation originating from neurons in tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, however, less is known about non-neuronal sources of histamine, such as mast cells, and their potential functional importance in development. Here we set out to investigate the spatiotemporal localisation of mast cells in the developing C57Bl/6 mouse brain and the potential impact of their degranulation on developing synapses. Firstly, we find that the mouse brain contains relatively larger numbers of mast cells during the first and second postnatal week. Secondly, that in this period the highest density of mast cells is found just below the hippocampus at the hippocampal-thalamic border with lower numbers found in other brain regions. Thirdly, using the mast cell degranulator C48/80 we observe that their degranulation can facilitate synaptic transmission at the perforant pathway inputs to the ventral portion of the dentate gyrus which could not be blocked by co-application of the histamine H3 receptor antagonist thioperamide. In contrast histamine superfusion tended to decrease synaptic transmission at this pathway which was sensitive to thioperamide co-application. In conclusion, these results suggest that mast cells are present in the developing C57Bl/6 mouse brain and in particular at the hippocampal-thalamic border where upon degranulation they appear to modulate hippocampal synaptic transmission.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

This is counterintuitive - why would asubset of people selected because they all have the same disease be more varied than the generalpopulation? We used simulated data and real neuroimaging data to identify a potential cause ofelevated variance in populations of patients with schizophrenia. We demonstrated that elevatedvariance can arise within variables that are unrelated to disease status simply because peoplewith a set of neurological perturbations that cause schizophrenia are more likely to have highernumbers of perturbations overall. Additionally, we showed that observed elevated variances inpeople with schizophrenia can be reproduced by models that only rely on perturbation count.These results highlight an important barrier in our attempts to understand the pathophysiology ofschizophrenia. Standard statistical practices in schizophrenia research do not account for the factthat schizophrenia is, at every level of analysis that has been studied, highly heterogeneous. Thisheterogeneity by itself is sufficient to produce elevated variances. Our work suggests that themost effective way to prevent schizophrenia may not be to identify and mitigate specificpathologies but rather to reduce the impact of broadly damaging factors such as those associatedwith poverty.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Single-cell RNA-seq mapping onto an embryonic reference revealed that these cells are not related to adult striatal neuron types but instead belong to the LGE-MEIS2/PAX6 interneuron class. Notch abrogation, which mimics neurogenic activation, drives both cortical and striatal astrocytes toward this same interneuron class, revealing a shared intrinsic commitment.

We tested this hypothesis using in vitro physiology, population genetic simulations, and genomic surveys. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 in human red blood cells reproduced the high-affinity phenotype, providing a biochemical basis for impaired placental oxygen transfer. Simulations showed that maternal-fetal mismatch drives frequency-dependent selection against the Neanderthal allele, promoting demographic decline.

A.; Billinger, S.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emerging research indicates cognitive dual-tasking is an early marker for cognitive impairment, with particular implications for Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) carriers who are at higher genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. While APOE4 carriers typically show accelerated cognitive decline and impaired cerebrovascular function with aging, exceptions to this norm exist and may provide insights into resilience mechanisms. The relationship between cerebrovascular response and cognitive-motor dual-task performance in cognitively-normal APOE4 carriers who maintain preserved function remains unclear. METHODS: Thirty cognitively-normal older adults (76+/-4 years, 8 APOE4 carriers, 22 noncarriers) completed clinical balance and cognitive testing under single-task and dual-task conditions. Balance performance was assessed as distance traversed during challenging beam walking. Cognitive performance was assessed as response time during an auditory Stroop test. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound measured cerebrovascular response to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. We tested group differences in cognitive-balance dual task performance and relationships between cerebrovascular response and dual-task interference (DTI) in balance and cognitive domains, and effects of APOE4 genotype on these relationships. RESULTS: No differences in cerebrovascular response or dual-task performance were observed between APOE4 carriers and noncarriers. However, APOE4 carriers displayed unique cerebrovascular-behavioral relationships. In APOE4 carriers, higher cerebrovascular response to exercise was associated with less balance DTI (r=0.839, p=0.009) and less cognitive DTI (r=0.832, p=0.020), while no relationships were observed in noncarriers (p>0.187). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitively-normal APOE4 carriers with preserved cognitive-balance dual-task function represent exceptions that may model aging resilience mechanisms. The unique cerebrovascular-behavioral relationships suggest that maintaining cerebrovascular function provides preliminary support for neuromotor and neurocognitive resilience to dual-task challenges in genetically vulnerable populations.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated how SNT-1 and SNT-3 mediate fast and slow neurotransmitter release through their potential interactions with the SNARE complex and their polybasic motifs. AlphaFold 3 models of SNT-1--SNARE and SNT-3--SNARE complexes accurately recapitulated the canonical Syt1 C2B--SNARE primary interface (Zhou et al., 2015, Nature) and precisely identified conserved binding residues within the C2B domains, as well as in SNAP-25 and Syntaxin, highlighting the evolutionary conservation of this interaction. Electrophysiological analyses using targeted mutagenesis demonstrated that both SNT-1 and SNT-3 require C2B--SNARE interactions and polybasic motifs within their C2 domains to drive evoked fast and slow neurotransmitter release. Notably, SNT-1 and SNT-3 exhibited differential dependence on distinct regions of the C2B--SNARE interface and their respective polybasic motifs, suggesting that Ca2+-triggered fast and slow release operate via distinct mechanistic strategies. Furthermore, we found that SNT-1 mediates spontaneous neurotransmitter release through multiple pathways, involving not only the primary C2B--SNARE interface but also additional putative SNARE-binding interactions.

CTCF-bound looped enhancers and promoters are refractory to activity-dynamic DNA methylation. Looped enhancers bound by CTCF can exhibit memory of activity-induced histone modifications and persistent expression of activity-upregulated genes.

Yet, whether such a mechanism is generalizable to Mandarin Chinese, a language that both has suprasegmental phonemes in the form of lexical tones and contains more monosyllabic words, which may lead to higher reliance on either phonemic-level or syllabic-level perceptual representations, is unclear. In this study, we applied transcranial electric stimulation with either theta or gamma alternating currents (tACS) to bilateral auditory cortices in healthy Mandarin-speaking participants during a consonant or tone identification task in quiet or noisy environments. Results showed that theta tACS impaired consonant identification in quiet, specifically, and generally prolonged reaction times across tasks and environments. Gamma tACS, however, only delayed tone identification in quiet. Besides, both theta and gamma tACS modulated perceptual decision-making parameters, leading to increased boundary thresholds (cautiousness of decision) and altered response biases in the perceptual decision of both consonants and tones, as evidenced by the hierarchical drift-diffusion model (HDDM). These findings indicate that theta oscillations causally support the perception of Mandarin syllables, with consonants and lexical tones presumably embedded in syllable-level representations, regardless of task difficulty.

Thus, the timing and magnitude of dopamine release is critical for learning. Recent work has characterized a local striatal microcircuit in which cholinergic interneurons (CINs) modulate dopamine release via acetylcholine activation of nicotinic receptors on dopamine axons. Here, we show that visual stimuli evoke dopamine responses in the dorsomedial striatum through this cholinergic-dependent mechanism. Using anatomical and functional methods to identify which pathways elicit these signals, we found that primary visual cortex and early sensory areas that project to the striatum exhibited only weak connectivity to CINs, despite robust connectivity to projection neurons, and were unable to drive dopamine release. In contrast, frontal cortical regions, including the prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices, strongly recruited CINs and acetylcholine, producing robust dopamine release both ex vivo and in vivo. These findings reveal a fundamental distinction between sensory and frontal cortical inputs to the striatum, demonstrating that only the latter provide effective access to cholinergic-dependent dopamine signaling.

We investigated dynamic functional connectivity within the DMN in SZ by analyzing resting-state fMRI data from two independent cohorts (FBIRN and COBRE). Using a novel iterative feature-removal clustering approach focusing on DMN independent components, we identified distinct recurring connectivity states while iteratively removing dominant connectivity features to reveal subtler network patterns. This approach iteratively refines the set of features considered, ensuring a more balanced representation and facilitating the identification of significant interactions that would otherwise be overlooked. Cluster centroids for the four connectivity states were highly similar across both datasets, reflecting stable shared DMN patterns. State occupancy was compared between participants with SZ and healthy controls, and associations with clinical symptom severity were examined. The SZ group exhibited significant alterations in DMN connectivity dynamics, spending more time than controls in certain connectivity states characterized by atypical DMN coupling and less time in a state reflecting a normative DMN configuration. A comparison between the FBIRN and COBRE datasets reveals both similarities and differences in occupancy rate (OCR) states. Overall, the pattern of group effects converged while state-specific divergences likely reflected protocol/sample differences rather than conflicting biology. Crucially, the explainability pipeline yielded a highly similar feature-removal order across datasets, indicating that the same DMN edges drive the diagnostic signal in both cohorts. Several OCR effects also tracked symptom ratings, linking abnormal DMN dynamics to clinical expression. Our findings suggest that SZ is characterized by reproducible disturbances in the temporal organization of DMN connectivity. These dynamic DMN features may serve as potential biomarkers for SZ, offering diagnostic and clinical utility by capturing network dysfunction that static connectivity measures could overlook.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

We use a selectivity space to explain how these similar and differential effects on representational drift emerge from the dynamics of individual neuronal tuning. We further examine functional consequences of drift using reversal learning tasks where stimulus-reward associations switch.

As the bud elongates, it stretches the epithelial cells at the base, which mechanically activates YAP and causes the epithelial sheet to fold downward and form a stiff cylindrical wall that invaginates into the skin. This stiff epithelial tongue is essential to the compaction and formation of the tightly packed dermal papillae. These topological transformational events are mechanically interconnected, and the completion of the previous circuit initializes the next one.

We used a replicated artificial selection approach to examine the response to copper selection in Drosophila melanogaster collected from a retired mine and active fruit orchard. We tracked shifts in resistance to the target trait, copper, as well as off-target effects on cadmium and lead resistance, starvation resistance, lifespan, and feeding aversion to copper contaminated food. Selection for copper resistance increased the focal trait and maintained resistance to non-essential heavy metals while control flies lost metal resistance overtime, implying a cost associated with maintaining resistance to heavy metals. Starvation resistance was correlated with copper resistance, but the correlation was not sufficient to explain the gain in copper resistance. Lifespan was correlated with increased copper resistance in flies collected from one of the two collection sites, suggesting that life history traits may be influenced by repeated heavy metal exposure.

We combined population genomics, morphometrics, and stable isotope analysis to test whether white sticklebacks represent a distinct lineage and whether they have diverged along ecological axes as in other stickleback populations. Genotyping-by-sequencing revealed that male and female white sticklebacks form a genetic cluster distinct from sympatric common sticklebacks with evidence of ongoing gene flow yet with very low overall genomic divergence (FST {approx} 0.01). Genetic differences were distributed across many loci rather than localized to a single genomic region. Morphological and isotopic analyses revealed no differences in most classic ecological traits (body shape, armor, gill rakers, or trophic niche). Instead, whites are smaller-bodied, paler, and exhibit shorter spines, reduced testes size, and smaller but more numerous eggs compared to common sticklebacks.

The drift barrier hypothesis proposes that selection generally favors lower mutation rates due to the risk of deleterious mutations but acts less effectively against weak mutator alleles in smaller populations, allowing the mutation rate to increase due to genetic drift. Given this model, we propose that mutation rates may also be elevated in cell types that appear rarely in a population, where DNA replication and repair processes are subject to selection less often. We can begin to test this prediction in yeast species, some of which can be grown in either a haploid or diploid cell state. Existing data on the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae support this prediction, with a higher mutation rate observed in haploids, which is the rare cell type in natural populations. However, this pattern could also appear if haploidy is inherently mutagenic, regardless of the dominant cell type. To test these alternatives, we conducted a mutation accumulation experiment with haploid and diploid cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in which diploidy is the rare cell type. In this species, we found a higher mutation rate in diploids, consistent with our prediction. In both species, the spectrum of mutations is also influenced by ploidy state.

D. melanogaster Stellate (Ste) is an X-linked meiotic driver that preferentially harms Y-chromosome-bearing spermatids, thereby favoring the transmission of the X chromosome to the next generation. We have recently shown that Ste protein segregates asymmetrically during meiosis I with a strong bias toward the Y-chromosome-inheriting side, leading to the eventual demise of the Y-chromosome-containing spermatids. However, the cellular mechanisms by which Ste protein interferes with spermatid development remain unknown. Here, we show that Ste-containing spermatids are delayed in the process of nuclear envelope remodeling, an essential process during sperm DNA compaction. We show that Lamin Dm0, a component of the nuclear lamina, is rapidly removed during nuclear envelope remodeling during the early stages of normal spermatid development. However, Ste-containing spermatid retained Lamin Dm0 for a prolonged time. Delayed Lamin Dm0 removal is associated with defective formation of the dense complex, which is composed of the bundle of microtubules and serves as a structural support for sperm nuclear morphogenesis. Defective dense complex formation in Ste-containing spermatid led to defective sperm DNA compaction.

Here, we used computer vision to extract high-dimensional traits from standardized museum specimens and assembled the largest comparative dataset of wing color patterns to date, spanning over one third of all known Nymphalid species. We first tested whether chemically defended species occupy a distinct region in morphospace and then derived a quantitative score for aposematism from the principal color patterns associated with defense. Using this score, we examined whether aposematic signals are expressed consistently across wing surfaces and sexes, and whether their origins are linked to shifts in evolutionary rate. We found that the dominant axis of morphospace is defined by chromatic and achromatic contrast, along which defended and undefended species cluster. Validation with an expert-labeled moth dataset confirmed that this axis separates aposematic from non-aposematic phenotypes across Lepidoptera. Consistent with theory, strongly aposematic species showed greater visual similarity between dorsal and ventral surfaces, between sexes, and among individuals. Rate analyses further indicated that aposematic patterns evolved repeatedly and were associated with non-linear shifts in evolutionary tempo. Together, these results identify aposematism as the dominant organizing axis of wing color pattern evolution in Nymphalidae.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

To further assess the relationship between different Cutthroat Trout lineages, we sequenced and assembled full mitochondrial genomes from 123 Cutthroat Trout from across their native range. We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic approaches to examine the evolutionary relationships between all named Cutthroat Trout subspecies. Through these analyses, we find 11 lineages of Cutthroat Trout that diverged > 2 million years ago, and at least 13 lineages that diverged > 1 million years ago, highlighting the ancient origin of Cutthroat Trout. Despite the ancient split between many Cutthroat Trout lineages, we do not find that Coastal, Westslope, Lahontan, or Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout are more distinct than other lineages, and as such, we continue to recognize a single Cutthroat Trout species (Oncorhynchus clarkii) comprised of twelve distinct subspecies, maintaining consistency with conservation efforts, management plans, ESA-related decisions, while also preserving stability associated with historic nomenclature.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Pseudogenes ({varphi}genes) generated during such genome rearrangements are often considered dead on arrival due to compromised expression arising from disruptive mutations or loss of regulatory elements. In an earlier study, we traced the expression of several {varphi}genes, which challenges this notion. Here, we report segmental duplications at proximal genomic locations occasionally generate chimerism as a continuum of sequences from two or more genes, some of which involve intron fusions. These specific introns and flanking exons are likely to have co-evolved from ancestral parent genes. Notably, co-opting upstream regulatory sequences of 5' parent gene may enable activation of chimeric {varphi}genes, while modifications in 3' sequences impart transcript stability. Few chimeric {varphi}genes also harbor strong coding ORFs to be potentially translated into novel or truncated proteins retaining parental domains. Interestingly, chimeric {varphi}genes are expressed only in human tissues, and display signatures of purifying selection. Examining potential functions associates ANAPC1P2 with genotoxic stress responses, while HYDIN2 may play a putative role in regulating cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation. Taken together, our results suggest chimeric {varphi}genes and their de novo functions may be relevant to speciation.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

The genomic basis of this ecological breadth in A. alternata remains poorly understood. Here we leverage the opportunity of wild pathosystems to study pathogen evolution and diversity beyond agricultural settings. We sampled isolates from wild tomato species across a 2,500 km range in South America, producing highly contiguous genomes, to investigate population structure. Our comparative genomics analyses reveal that A. alternata sensu stricto consists of two divergent clades. Strikingly, this divergence is not linked to host species, geography, or habitat type. Transposable elements contribute to variation within clades but do not explain their separation. Although some signs of recombination are present, reproductive mode appears stable across clades. Notably, global reference isolates cluster with one clade, while the other, more diverse clade is only found in wild populations. We hypothesize that these wild populations may act as reservoirs of evolutionary potential. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the population structure of necrotrophic pathogens and raise new questions about how genetic divergence can persist without ecological or geographic isolation.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we use DamID and image analysis to reveal the dynamics of LAD biogenesis during C. elegans embryogenesis. At early stages, DNA at the lamina is transcriptionally active and lacks lamina-associated heterochromatin. This state depends on abundant nuclear pores, which prevent heterochromatin accumulation at the nuclear periphery. As development proceeds, pore numbers decline, enabling heterochromatin to access the lamina. Reducing nuclear-pore components induces precocious accumulation of heterochromatin to the lamina. Functionally, we find that heterochromatic LADs confer protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Older embryos are resistant to UV light and concentrate DNA damage at the nuclear periphery, whereas early embryos are UV sensitive and accumulate damage throughout nuclei when unshielded by their mothers in utero. These findings identify embryonic dissipation of nuclear pores as a key step in heterochromatic LAD assembly, allowing older embryos to withstand exposure to UV irradiation.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

We found that most AID/APOBECs remain predominantly in either a closed or indeterminate state to varying degrees while A3G-CD2 is predominantly open. This occurs chiefly from the catalytic residues themselves and the loop 1 serine/threonine in the \"floor\" of the catalytic pocket while other residues of the secondary catalytic loops 1, 3, 5, and 7 aid in these states. Surprisingly, we found that the presupposed stable position of AID's unique 7 ({beta}-state) in contact with the {beta}-sheet and 6 was unstable while the -state in contact with 6 and loop7 was stable and caused pocket closure. Mutations could cause the destabilisation of the -state (R171Y and R178D) or stabilisation of the {beta}-state (R190D and R194A). Thus, pocket states are relatively similar in overall cause; however, multiple residues from sec-ondary catalytic loops as well as AID-7 determine the rates at which these states occur, potentially affecting the chances any AID/APOBEC is able to have catalysis.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

A cryo-EM structure of SCFFBH1 bound to DNA representing a stalled fork reveals an intimate interaction between FBH1 and the fork junction. Disruption of this interface severely curtails fork reversal in vitro and replication progression in cells, providing a model for how ssDNA translocation by FBH1 facilitates annealing of parental DNA by a fundamentally different mechanism than the fork remodelers SMARCAL, HLTF, and ZRANB3.

We introduce MIRNAPEX, an interpretable expression-stratification-based machine learning framework that quantifies the effect size of miRNA regulatory activity from RNA-seq by integrating target-gene expression with 3'UTR isoform usage to infer binding-site dosage. Using pan-cancer training sets, we fit regularized linear models to learn robust relationships between transcriptomic features and miRNA log-fold changes, with APA patterns adding clear predictive power beyond expression alone. When applied to knockdowns of core APA regulators, MIRNAPEX captured widespread 3'UTR shortening and correctly anticipated distinct, miRNA-specific shifts whose direction and magnitude mirrored the APA-driven change in site availability. Analysis of target-directed miRNA degradation interactions further showed that loss of distal decay-trigger sites coincides with higher miRNA abundance, consistent with a reduced degradation rate. Together these findings reveal that apparent DE of miRNAs can arise from dynamic changes in target-site landscapes rather than altered miRNA transcription, and that ignoring this aspect in conventional analysis workflows can lead to misestimation of the true effect size of gene-expression regulation.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Affected individuals are predisposed to developing pheochromocytomas (Pheo), paragangliomas (PGL), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Notably, tumors with succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) deficiency demonstrate increased metastatic risk, for which treatments remain palliative. Hence, discovering novel therapeutic avenues to improve the prognosis for SDHB-cancer patients is an urgent need. Here we employed human SDHB-deficient UOK269 RCC cells (SDHB-KO) and isogenic SDHB-reconstituted control cells (SDHB-WT) to discover SDH-dependent mitochondria-directed cytotoxic agents. Given the reduced ATP-generating capacity of SDHB-KO cells, we hypothesized they would be uniquely sensitive to futile cycle induction with mitochondrial ionophores (2,4-Dinitrophenol (2-DNP), BAM15, Niclosamide, Nitazoxanide). Indeed, these compounds exhibited preferential cytotoxicity toward SDHB-KO cells. However, the chemotherapeutic compound Ym155 demonstrated the most potent and dramatic (five-fold) preferential cytotoxicity towards SDHB-KO cells. Importantly, the SDH-dependent cytotoxicity of Ym155 was validated in both primary human pheochromocytoma cells and mouse pheochromocytoma (MPC) cells. Furthermore, because few SDH-deficient cell lines are available, we buttressed our findings in additional relevant cell lines by modeling SDH-deficiency using chemical SDH enzyme inhibition with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA). We observed a persistent cooperativity between SDH-deficiency and Ym155 cytotoxicity across multiple cell lineages and disease models. Mechanistically, Ym155-induced cytotoxicity was independent of its primary target, Survivin. Instead, SDH-deficiency sensitized cells to Ym155-induced DNA damage. Strikingly, the phenotype of SDH-deficient Ym155 sensitivity was recapitulated by inhibition of the histone demethylase KDM4, a downstream consequence of SDH deficiency. Thus, the accumulation of succinate in SDH-deficient tumors inhibits KDM4 activity, impairs DNA repair and yields enhanced susceptibility to Ym155-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The identified intrinsic susceptibilities of SDHB-deficient cancers has the potential to be therapeutically leveraged.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "During the early COVID-19 pandemic, non-human primate (NHP) models, particularly rhesus macaques (RM), became vital for preclinical antiviral testing. However, their utility for predicting optimal human dosing remains uncertain. We applied previously validated mathematical models--originally fit to human clinical trial viral load data--to RM infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, molnupiravir, or both. Our analysis revealed that both drugs exhibit greater antiviral potency in lungs than in nasal passages. Nirmatrelvir showed lower efficacy in RM (30% nasal, 46% lung) than in humans (82%), largely due to its shorter plasma half-life in macaques. In contrast, molnupiravir efficacy in RM (95% nasal, 99% lung) closely matched human efficacy against Omicron variants. Critically, achieving 50% viral inhibition in humans requires 10-fold higher nirmatrelvir plasma concentrations than in RM, while only 1/20th the molnupiravir concentration is needed in humans. These discrepancies stem from drug-specific differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tissue-specific viral dynamics between species. Consequently, while NHP models offer valuable insights into drug mechanisms and relative efficacy, they are insufficient for precise human dose optimization. Human Phase 1 and 2 clinical trial data remain superior for this purpose, as they directly reflect human physiology and drug response. Our findings caution against overreliance on NHP data for dosing predictions and underscore the need for human-centric modeling when translating preclinical results to clinical practice.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

As tactile technologies advance, there is growing interest in whether musical information can be conveyed through vibration. This study investigates how core dimensions of auditory music perception, pitch, roughness, and pleasantness, can be translated into the tactile domain. Participants were asked to rate these perceptual dimensions in response to sinusoidal and complex waveforms, including amplitude-modulated signals, sawtooth, and missing fundamental stimuli. Perceived pitch showed a systematic relationship with stimulus frequency for most participants, suggesting that tactile devices could effectively convey melodic patterns. The sawtooth waveform emerged as particularly effective for representing pitch changes, underscoring the role of rapid temporal transitions in tactile pitch encoding. Roughness ratings were negatively correlated with pleasantness, mirroring well-established findings in auditory perception. Waveforms with sudden temporal changes or rapid amplitude modulations were consistently judged as less pleasant. Taken together, these findings indicate that tactile systems can effectively convey melodic structure and emotional tone, laying the groundwork for musical touch interfaces. Importantly, our results highlight the crucial role of the fast temporal envelope rather than the temporal fine structure, in shaping vibrotactile perception. Consistent with this interpretation, our data provide evidence for a tactile analog of the auditory missing fundamental phenomenon, reinforcing the idea that tactile pitch perception primarily relies on envelope periodicity rather than the presence of specific frequency components.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

The transgenerational plasticity of maternal effects on offspring phenotypes has been well recognized, however, weather maternal effect can drive dynamic changes in population genetic structure by modifying the competitive dynamics among offspring is still unclear. 2. After evaluation of the reliability of COI metabarcoding for intraspecific clone quantification using a monogonont rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus as the model animal, a high-frequency dynamic monitoring experimental system was set to measure maternal effect on temporal dynamics in gene frequencies within mixed populations containing morphologically identical clones. 3. Results showed that maternal effects significantly enhanced the competitive fitness of the target offspring clone, leading to a rapid increase in its frequency inside the population. However, this advantage last for a few generations, and gradually diminished or even reversed as the maternal effects attenuated across generations. 4. Temperature dynamically affected the duration of maternal effect: higher temperature shortened the duration of maternal effects on population genetic dynamics, while lower temperature prolonged it. 5. By population dynamic monitoring, this study revealed the transient nature of maternal effect as a non-genetic buffering mechanism, providing an integrative theoretical framework for understanding the dynamic integration of short-term plasticity and long-term selection pressure in adaptive evolution of intraspecific clones.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Using a pan-cancer cohort of 1,662 patients from the MSK-IMPACT study who received ICI therapy, we computed three scores per patient: TMB, Alpha (sum of AlphaMissense scores), and AlphaTMB (product of TMB and Alpha). Patients were stratified using both cancer-specific and pan-cancer quantiles. Survival outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, controlling for cancer type, age, and ICI regimen. AlphaTMB showed strong correlation with TMB (Spearman {rho} = 0.866, p < 0.001), but offered improved prognostic accuracy. Patients in the bottom 80% AlphaTMB group had significantly poorer survival than those in the top 10% (HR < 2.51, p < 0.001), outperforming TMB and Alpha alone. AlphaTMB reclassified borderline cases, identifying subsets with low TMB but high deleterious mutation load, and vice versa. Gene mutation heatmaps and co-occurrence analysis confirmed that to 10% AlphaTMB-high tumors were enriched in mismatch repair and POLE mutations, reflecting a neoantigen-rich, immunotherapy-responsive phenotype.

Participants completed two separate learning tasks and a test, wherein each trial began with a cue, indicating which learning task should be employed. Random test trials included a probe instead of concept specific features: a small arrow appeared at a feature location that was relevant (i.e., valid) or irrelevant (i.e., invalid) for the cued task. Successful learners were faster at responding to valid probes than invalid, demonstrating the deployment of concept-specific attentional templates.

Eutrophic, non-wadable rivers with in-stream obstruction were commonly modeled, though diverse environmental characteristics were reported. Most articles used algal biomass or chlorophyll as modeling endpoints, with a quarter using novel or unique endpoints. Algal toxins motivated model development in 23% of the articles, however just 5% used algal toxins as an endpoint. Only 6% of the articles modeled benthic HABs; the rest focused on pelagic HABs. There was no standard model used for modeling river HABs. Process-based models were more common (59%) than data-driven approaches (37%), with model formulations ranging from simple to complex, which contrasts with a lake-focused literature review of HAB models that found data-driven models were more common. Models in river settings shared similar input variables as those previously identified for lakes, such as water temperature, nutrients, and light availability. However, streamflow and other transport metrics took prominence in river models compared to lake models. Algal cell physiology (such as growth, predation, and motility) was routinely included as input data or as mathematical formulations in process-based models and these processes were frequently identified as an important predictor by the articles' authors. Conversely, data-driven models rarely included these processes, instead using predictors related to environmental conditions, such as nutrients, water quality, water temperature, and streamflow. These important proxy predictors have apparent success with modeling overall algal biomass (irrespective of taxa) whereas other factors, such as those related to algal physiology and other biological processes, are likely responsible for more subtle shifts in community composition. These differences highlight the influence of data availability, especially for processes that are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to measure, on model development and model outcomes, raising questions about the selection of modeling inputs and endpoints. Challenges to advancing river HAB modeling include the lack of site-specific model inputs representing key processes (e.g., photosynthetic parameters and predation rates), overlooked riverine environments like the benthos and side/back-channel areas, lack of information on environmental settings, and poorly reported model performance metrics. This review emphasizes opportunities for advancing river HAB modeling by learning from well-honed estuarine models, supporting current forecasting and operationalization efforts, and developing common datasets for river HAB model development and evaluation.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

A reference genome is available for the American lobster, but not yet for the European lobster, despite its ecological significance, and importance to fisheries and aquaculture. Here, we present a high-quality genome assembly and annotation for the European lobster. The assembly spans 1.76 Gb, with a scaffold N50 of 1.82 Mb and a BUSCO completeness of 97.6%. As observed in the American lobster, the total assembly span is substantially smaller than genome size estimates derived from flow cytometry, performed using independently sampled European lobsters (3.18 - 3.42 Gb). This discrepancy may reflect the highly repetitive nature of decapod genomes, with 51.8% of the H. gammarus assembly consisting of repetitive elements. Leveraging a comprehensive multi-tissue RNA-seq dataset, we annotated 23,223 protein-coding genes and characterised gene expression across ten tissues to generate a tissue-level gene expression atlas, available at www.LobsterGeneX.com. Using single-copy orthologs, we estimated a divergence time of 26 Mya (95% HPD 22 - 30 Mya) between H. gammarus and H. americanus, corresponding to the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. We also identified Homarus-specific gene duplications with roles in immunity and longevity, including telomere maintenance. The reported genomic resources can facilitate future research into lobster biology, support sustainable fisheries and aquaculture management practices, and enable investigations of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying basic biological processes, notably immunity and longevity in Homarid lobsters.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

APA can affect RNA function, stability, and subcellular localization, thereby influencing development and disease processes. Currently, computational tools based on various algorithms, such as Sierra, polyApipe, and SCAPE, have been developed to infer polyA site positions from scRNA-seq data. However, these methods exhibit significant differences in the number of predicted sites and positional inconsistencies in the sites identified for the same gene, leading to divergent conclusions when analyzing the same data with different tools. Results: We designed two strategies to integrate the outputs of alternative APA tools, enabling users to select appropriate polyA site sets based on their specific needs. Our method can be used to extract high confidence sites, supported by all methods, as well as putative sites supported by a subset of methods. We find that methods with high sensitivity for detecting APA sites can be usefully augmented by methods with higher positional accuracy but lower sensitivity. We show that our method obtains the expected number of high-confidence sites and that these sites exhibit the expected biological sequence characteristics.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Thanks to these developments, Protein Language Models (PLMs) have become important resources for diverse tasks such as predicting protein family, function, solubility, cellular location, molecular interactions and remote homology. However, the size of the best performing PLMs (which can be up to 15B parameters) requires substantial computational power. Protein Dimension DB addresses this critical bottleneck by providing a centralized, version-controlled resource of precomputed protein embeddings, experimentally validated molecular function annotations, and taxonomic encodings. The database integrates embeddings from seven state-of-the-art PLMs, including ProtT5, ESM2, and Ankh variants for all Swiss-Prot/ UniProt proteins. These models were compared by benchmarking molecular function prediction. Tests revealed that hybrid embeddings (e.g., Ankh Base + ProtT5) outperformed single-model approaches with minimal dimensionality increases. Taxonomic encodings further boosted performance by 2.9% AUPRC, demonstrating lineage-aware learning. By providing embeddings in Parquet format - a columnar storage optimized for machine learning workflows - the resource eliminates GPU-dependent preprocessing and reduces storage requirements. This enables immediate use in resource-constrained environments while maintaining backward compatibility through versioned releases. All datasets are freely accessible via Github and HuggingFace, with unified metadata enabling applications from functional annotation to evolutionary studies.

Here, we systematically compare multiple CAR-T constructs targeting clinically-relevant antigen B7-H3 and identify antigen-independent CAR activation, or tonic signaling, as a key determinant of therapeutic performance. We find that B7-H3 CAR-T cells with restrained tonic signaling display superior tumor killing, persistence, and resistance to exhaustion, along with reduced CAR membrane clustering, in patient-derived DIPG models. Integrated multi-omics and single-cell profiling further reveal a CAR-T tonic signaling-associated gene signature that outperforms conventional exhaustion or stemness markers in predicting therapeutic efficacy across multiple clinical trials, including DIPG and other tumor types.

The central problem for early diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases is the subtlety of early symptoms and where to look for them. Without defined behavioral markers, the earliest stages of disease go undetected, delaying intervention and limiting neuroprotective therapeutic evaluation. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) based framework that identifies subtle postural alterations in freely behaving animals. Using longitudinal pose data from SOD1G93A mice, a widely used Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) mouse model, we focused on postural states in idle periods, behavioral states usually overlooked in disease monitoring. Our analyses revealed consistent deviations in posture and a feature analysis pinpointed cervical instability during adolescence as a key distinguishing feature. We validated these findings through two independent behavioral assays engaging cervical musculature: rearing and wet-dog shakes, both of which showed significant impairments in male SOD1G93A mice as early as 3 weeks of age, many weeks earlier than conventional muscle function assays. This approach establishes an unbiased, non-invasive, scalable strategy for detecting early-stage neuromuscular dysfunction, and provides a foundation both for clinical behavioral biomarker development in ALS and related disorders and will enable evaluation of early neuroprotective interventions.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

However, the pathways through which the gut conveys adverse or unpleasant information to the brain are still not well understood. In this study, we identify an aversive gut-brain axis in Drosophila melanogaster that detects toxin-induced gut damage and triggers both innate and learned anticipatory emesis (vomiting). After toxin ingestion, reactive oxygen species are produced by midgut enterocytes and detected by the transient receptor potential channel TrpA1 on nearby enteroendocrine cells. This sensing stimulates the release of neuropeptides from enteroendocrine cells, likely representing the gastric malaise flies experience after eating. We show that these neuropeptides act on specific serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the brain. These neurons interact with each other and signal to the downstream memory-related mushroom bodies to promote emesis. This circuit not only drives an immediate emetic response but also represents a malaise-driven aversive signal. The signal manifests as the persistent activity of dopaminergic neurons, which reinforces aversive valence to odor cues in the mushroom bodies. Thus, the flies learn that a specific odor predicts the presence of a toxin in food and exhibit anticipatory emesis upon re-exposure to the same odor. Taken together, we have identified an interoceptive signaling pathway that may be conserved for detecting harmful gut conditions and for remembering how to avoid them. Our work offers a mechanistic framework for studying aversive gut-brain communication involved in feeding, metabolism, depression, brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

These cascades are negatively controlled by serine protease inhibitors (serpins) and fine-tuned by serine protease homologs (SPHs), which resemble SPs but lack catalytic activity. In Drosophila, a key SP cascade, the Toll phenoloxidase (PO) pathway, governs both the melanization response and Toll-dependent antimicrobial peptide production. This cascade is triggered by secreted pattern-recognition receptors or microbial proteases and converges on two clip domain SPs, Persephone and Hayan, which activate the Toll ligand Spaezle via the Spaetzle Processing Enzyme (SPE) and process prophenoloxidases. Here, we characterize the SPH Skanda and uncover its role in the Toll PO cascade. skanda is genomically clustered with hayan and persephone and is transcriptionally induced upon infection. Skanda is unusual among SPHs, containing a long serine/threonine-rich region, two clip domains, and atypical disulfide bonds. Skanda is unstable and subject to cleavage by Grass. Functional assays show that Skanda dampens activation of Hayan, and to a lesser extent Persephone, within the Toll PO cascade. Notably, skanda-deficient flies are highly susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus despite displaying normal Toll signaling and cuticular melanization. Moreover, compound mutants lacking two members of the hayan psh skanda cluster reveal a hidden contribution of Skanda to Toll activation in the absence of Persephone. Together, our results identify Skanda as a modulatory SPH that fine tunes Toll pathway activity in concert with Persephone and Hayan.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

However, they are now also known to regulate plethora of non-apoptotic functions such as proliferation, differentiation, endocytic trafficking, cell polarity, morphogenesis, inflammatory response and immune response. Here, in this study we report the role of Drosophila caspase 3, Drice, in spatial and dynamic regulation of actin filaments during development and proper functioning of the Malpighian tubules (MTs) of Drosophila melanogaster. Previously, we showed that Drice is crucial for the morphogenesis of the MTs, and its absence results in erroneous RhoGTPase signaling driving disarray in actin organization, this led to the formation of multiple fluid filled cysts in tubules. In the present study, we show that altered expression of two member of the Rho family of small GTPases, Rho1 and CDC42, perturbs the downstream signaling cascade. Reduced expression of Rok aborts the Rho1 signaling in Drice null mutants, whereas enhanced expression of CDC42 results in Arp2/3-driven hyper-polymerization of actin filaments. We compared Rho-GTPase interacting partners in Oregon R+ (Control) and Drice mutants, and identified the absence of Gelsolin-Rho1 interaction in Drice mutants. Moreover, its expression was significantly downregulated, in the MTs. These factors collectively influence the F-actin to G-actin ratio, which significantly affects actin organization in the MTs.

In our study, we report and discuss the expression pattern and cellular distribution of innexin-1, innexin-2 and innexin-3 in the cells of the wing imaginal discs. Our immunohistochemical data show that all three innexins are broadly expressed across the membranes of both the disc proper and peripodial epithelial cells of the wing disc. The stainings further reveal that, within the disc proper epithelium, junctional proteins are arranged in a clear apico-basal hierarchy: cadherins at the apical surface, followed by septate junction proteins, with innexins localised sub-apically beneath these components. All three innexins are enriched within this sub-apical domain, and are additionally detected at mid- and baso-lateral sites in varying levels. Notably, innexin-2 exhibits partial colocalization with coracle, a septate junction associated protein, suggesting a functional association. In the peripodial epithelium, innexins are detected in distinct punctate patterns across cell membranes, implying heterogeneity in their molecular characteristics. To validate these expression patterns, we carried out tissue-specific RNAi-mediated knockdowns using the pannier-Gal4 driver targeting the notum, a structurally and functionally important but underexplored region in innexin research. Knockdown of innexin-2 and innexin-3 led to complete loss of their expression within this region. Notably, silencing of innexin-2 also affected the expression of septate junction associated proteins and innexin-3 knockdown was accompanied by a significant reduction in disc size and altered morphology. These findings depict and confirm the presence of innexins in the notum region and also indicate that individual innexins may have distinct or shared functional roles within the same tissue domain of expression. Their localization to specific membrane domains is likely to underlie their differential modes of action. Although previous studies have demonstrated the functional involvement of gap junctions in various aspects of normal wing development in Drosophila, a description of the arrangement of innexins on the third instar wing discs is required for better understanding of their roles.

Using mouse models, we find that reproductive aging yields increased contractility in the extra-embryonic trophectoderm, the outer epithelial tissue responsible for mediating uterine attachment and embryo implantation. This hypercontractile state elevates tissue surface tension and viscosity in the blastocyst, culminating in defective spreading during implantation.

Results: We benchmarked five open-access generative AI platforms (ChatGPT, MistralAI, VarChat, Perplexity, and ScholarAI) across 40 curated variants equally divided between somatic and germline settings. For each variant, summary reports were generated and blindly evaluated by domain experts using five defined metrics.

Gpt-4o consistently ranked second, showing particularly stable robustness in conditions where the literature was scarce. Perplexity and ScholarAI, despite being literature-focused, ranked lowest across most metrics.

Finally, we compared the node degree distribution specifically for the somatomotor network (SMN) across groups. Lower putaminal DaT predicted higher SMN NAT. Patients with PD showed elevated SMN NAT versus controls. Neither global nor other networks showed an effect.

K.; Ehrhardt, E.; Cowan, N.; Dickerson, B. H.; Cohen, I.", "abstract": "Whether recovering after a gust of wind, or rapidly saccading away from an oncoming predator, fruit flies show remarkable aerial dexterity about their body roll axis. Here, we investigated the detailed wing kinematic changes during free-flight roll motion and probed the neuromuscular basis for such changes. Consistent with previous work, we observed that flies manipulated the stroke amplitude difference between their wings to control their roll angle. Here, we show that flies are capable of achieving such changes by altering the stroke amplitude of either or both of their wings. Further we found that during corrections flies can also take advantage of an aerodynamically significant change in the angle of attack of their uppermost wing. Curiously, these corrective wing changes cannot be eliminated when motor neurons hypothesized to be used during roll maneuvers (i1, i2, b1, b2, and b3) are individually inhibited. However, free-flight optogenetic manipulations and quasi-steady aerodynamic calculations show that each of these motor neurons individually can effect kinematic changes consistent with a roll correction.

Here, we investigated the detailed wing kinematic changes during free-flight roll motion and probed the neuromuscular basis for such changes. Consistent with previous work, we observed that flies manipulated the stroke amplitude difference between their wings to control their roll angle. Here, we show that flies are capable of achieving such changes by altering the stroke amplitude of either or both of their wings. Further we found that during corrections flies can also take advantage of an aerodynamically significant change in the angle of attack of their uppermost wing. Curiously, these corrective wing changes cannot be eliminated when motor neurons hypothesized to be used during roll maneuvers (i1, i2, b1, b2, and b3) are individually inhibited. However, free-flight optogenetic manipulations and quasi-steady aerodynamic calculations show that each of these motor neurons individually can effect kinematic changes consistent with a roll correction.

It acts through competitive inhibition of natural ligand estrogen (E2) of estrogen receptor (ER), affecting ER interactions with other nuclear receptors, chromatin modulators, genomic structural proteins and co-regulators. Although tamoxifen inhibits the progression of breast cancer, it increases the risk of endometrial cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen could shift the DNA-binding signature of endometrial ER upon prolonged exposure during breast cancer, resembling the signature of endometrial ER in mammary cancer cells. Our laboratory had previously analyzed the progesterone receptor (PR) and ER cistromes of endometrial adenocarcinoma Ishikawa cells when treated with ovarian hormones, showing that ER binding sites are shared by PR in these endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line. This could explain, in part, progestin regulation of estrogen effects on ER/PR positive endometrial cancer cells. Here, we compared ER cistromes of endometrial tumors of both tamoxifen users and non-users with the ER and PR cistromes of the adenocarcinoma cell model. We found that ER cistrome of non-users is closer to transcriptionally active Ishikawa PR cistrome after R5020 treatment, while the ER cistrome of tamoxifen users is similar to Ishikawa ER cistrome after E2 treatment. These results indicate that tamoxifen treatment could change the ER chromatin landscape of endometrial tumor cells that can be occupied by PR in response to progestins. The subset of ERbs of non-users that could be shared by PR is enriched in NOTCH and inflammatory signaling pathway genes. On the other hand, the subset of ERbs of tamoxifen users that could be shared by ER in Ishikawa cells is enriched in early estrogen response pathway genes. These results could explain a context dependent response of genomic regions critical to be taken into account to prevent a deregulation of endometrial cells under tamoxifen treatment.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Moreover, moderators of protein synthesis (Igf1, Redd1, Deptor) remained altered following 30 days of AN and subsequent recovery.

Our findings demonstrate that the negative metabolic effects of environmental circadian desynchronization (ECD) are dependent upon the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1r). The endocannabinoid system has not previously been implicated in mediating the effects of circadian disruption. We showed that ECD induced a positive correlation between the levels of the endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG in both plasma and liver. While global CB1r knockout protects against the metabolic effects of ECD, behavioral and physiological response to ECD was strikingly similar between WT and CB1r KO mice and could not account for their distinct metabolic outcomes. Using liver-specific CB1r KO mice, we further specified that the ECD-induced metabolic hormone disruption, but not weight gain, is mediated through liver CB1r signaling. Finally, we showed that ECD upregulated transcription of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation in the liver of WT, but not liver-specific CB1r KO mice.

Here, we combine a five-week chamber experiment with multi-year satellite observations (2018-2021, Arkansas, U.S.) to investigate how O3 affects photosynthesis, efficiency, and growth across scales of soybean plants (Glycine max). At the leaf level, initial O3 fumigation (80 ppb for 4 h) caused the strongest suppression of CO2 assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (Gs), and photosystem II efficiency ({Phi}PSII), indicating entry into a physiological strain phase. Recovery between exposures was incomplete, leading to sustained growth reductions despite moderate O3 levels. At the regional scale, analysis of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and MODIS productivity metrics revealed parallel patterns. Early-season O3 episodes produced greater suppression of SIF, GPP, and Gs compared to equivalent late-season events, and recovery lagged for several weeks. Seasonal yield proxies were best explained not by total O3 accumulation, but by early- and peak-season exposures, which accounted for up to 98% of variance across four growing seasons. Our findings highlight that the timing of O3 episodes is more consequential than cumulative dose, and that functional indicators such as SIF can detect strain-phase stress before structural indices diverge. By linking controlled experiments with regional-scale satellite monitoring, this study advances mechanistic understanding of O3 impacts on soybean and supports the development of remote sensing-based early warning tools for crop management.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Yet, astronauts will face elevated health risks from microgravity and radiation as journeys continue for longer time periods. Approaches to combatting these health risks consist of growing fresh super foods in space for astronaut consumption while in flight. However, while a great deal is known about the effects of microgravity of humans, little is known about its effects on the nutrient profiles of plants. Endeavors towards understanding more about these effects are currently funded by NASA grants. Kale, a metabolite and specifically a flavonoid-rich crop, stands as a promising candidate for growth on space flights. We observed the effects of simulated microgravity broadly on the F1 cultivar, Starbor Kale metabolomics, and further focused on flavonoid content, using a 2-D clinostat. Extracts of kale were analyzed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (Proton NMR), and high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). Proton NMR spectra of clinostat-grown kale showed that samples from simulated microgravity conditions had an increased number of peaks in the aromatic region (6.5 to 8.5 ppm) when compared with gravity grown kale. HPTLC confirmed greater banding in medium- and high-polarity solvent systems, while low-polarity extracts showed no differences. Overall, we noted that the microgravity grown kale had greater amounts of bands present. These results signal that microgravity stressors may be connected to the increased secondary metabolite production in kale. Our findings underscore kale to be a prospective crop to be grown in space flight to combat effects of microgravity.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Quantified by aggregating differential gene expression responses across diverse cell types, time points, and doses, these CS retain the core features of individual experiments while preserving biological relevance. As proof of concept, genome-wide CS screening identified three knockdown-resistant genes - CCNA1, ORC1, and SOX2 - that also engage in their reciprocal up-regulation. Expression of this network is modulated by the factor E2F2, revealing a mechanism by which proliferative signaling persists despite diverse genetic and chemical perturbations. Crucially, we identify that ORC1 down-regulation by specific CDK4/6 inhibitors singularly disrupts this feedback loop, providing a direct route to suppress E2F2-driven proliferation. More generally, we demonstrate for the first time that CS can accurately predict RNA-seq responses in novel cell lines, uncovering evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that regulate fundamental biological processes beyond context-specific variability.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Biophysical models have partitioned this power budget across distinct cellular processes, but these theoretical estimates have yet to be empirically constrained using whole-brain electrophysiological data. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) source imaging of resting-state human brain activity to derive empirical lower-bound estimates of electrical power dissipation in cortical gray matter. We found that the total power dissipated by currents, primarily associated with post-synaptic potentials, ranges between 10-9 and 10-10 W, several orders of magnitude lower than prevailing metabolic estimates. Using finite element modeling (FEM), we observed that electrophysiological power dissipation is predominantly confined to gray matter. Additionally, spatial variations in MEG-derived power dissipation partially correlated with regional oxygen metabolism measured by PET, yet notable discrepancies emerged across large-scale functional brain networks. These results underscore a critical divergence between electrophysiological and metabolic indices of brain energy use, and highlight the need for more integrated biophysical models to bridge this gap and better characterize the physiological underpinnings of regional brain energetics.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Using in vivo assessments of mitochondrial biogenesis in zebrafish neurons, we determined that mitochondrial transport between distal axonal compartments and the cell body is required for sustained mitochondrial biogenesis.

Unlike laboratory experiments, these interactions unfold naturally and continuously. Although it is well established that gaze typically precedes object manipulation, much less is known about how gaze-hand patterns evolve in interactive settings where one person must take the other's actions into account. Here we examine predictive, planning-related behavior in a two-player tabletop game called \"do-undo\". Participants alternated as Leader and Follower. The Leader performed simple pick-and-place actions to alter the arrangement of objects, while the Follower used other objects to restore the previous configuration. We recorded eye and hand movements, along with object trajectories, using a system that combined eye tracking with multi-camera motion capture. Touch sensors on the players' hands provided precise timing of contacts, allowing us to segment cooperative action into well-defined temporal intervals. As expected, eye fixations consistently preceded manipulation, but clear role differences emerged. Leaders looked more often and earlier at target objects. In many trials, their gaze anticipated not only their own actions but also those required of the Follower. Leaders also more frequently checked the outcome of the do-undo sequence. Both roles showed gaze patterns consistent with memorization, but alternating gazes between objects and destinations were much more common in Leaders. Some patterns suggested longer-term planning beyond the immediate action. These findings reveal distinct decision-making and planning strategies in Leaders and Followers. Leaders consider not only their own next moves but also the potential actions of their partners, shedding light on the complex cognitive processes that underly everyday human interaction.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Using a mouse model in which one of those genes, Dusp4, was deleted, we aim to better understand the mechanisms implicated in myopia development and the role of DUSP4 in the retina. We report here that mice lacking DUSP4 have a reduced basal level of retinal dopamine and a higher susceptibility to lens-induced myopia. Dusp4 is expressed in ON-bipolar cells and a subset of OFF-bipolar cells in a light dependent manner. The absence of DUSP4 causes a hyperactivation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Dusp4-/- mice show a reduced optomotor response and an altered retinal response to light stimuli. We observed increased ON-bipolar cell responses and reduced oscillatory potentials together with altered OFF and ON-OFF RGC response to light flashes. Altogether, these data demonstrate a light-dependent role for DUSP4 in bipolar cell signaling and provide new insights into retina-driven mechanisms of myopia development, nuancing the impact of ON and OFF pathways upon emmetropization.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Despite their biogeochemical importance, detecting and quantifying mixotrophic presence and grazing in situ remains challenging, preventing a comprehensive understanding of their ecology and biogeography. Fluorescently labeled particle (FLP) incubations are commonly used to quantify mixotroph abundance and ingestion but may underestimate activity due to prey and size preferences of grazers. Acidotropic dyes that stain acidic vacuoles associated with phagotrophy have emerged as an alternative to FLP incubations for estimating mixotroph abundance, yet have not been thoroughly tested among a diverse suite of marine eukaryotes. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness and specificity of two dyes, LysoTracker Green and LysoSensor Blue, in laboratory cultures and natural marine communities. In laboratory cultures, both dyes correctly did not stain one photoautotrophic species. However, LysoSensor failed to stain several known mixotrophs, indicating false negatives, while both dyes stained photoautotrophic diatoms, indicating false positives. In the field, LysoTracker staining broadly tracked with FLP-derived results in the North East Shelf (NES) and the diatom-rich California Current System (CCS). Both methods indicated lower mixotroph abundance and proportion in the CCS, suggesting acidotropic dyes may more reliably reflect mixotrophy in the field than in monoculture.

The atrial-specific paralog, myosin binding protein-H like (MyBP-HL), has been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy in humans and mice. Both proteins bind to the same binding sites in the thick filament C-zone. In the atria, cMyBP-C and MyBP-HL are found at ~1:1 ratios, while ventricles only express cMyBP-C, which is found at twice the atrial level, indicating a stoichiometric relationship. In the atria, we hypothesize that missense variants in either gene may cause alterations in thick filament binding affinity and changes in the normal ~1:1 ratio. Notably, MyBP-HL deletion in atrial myofibrils accelerates relaxation kinetics, suggesting that altered stoichiometry impacts biophysical parameters. We hypothesized that deletion, overexpression, or missense variants in either gene would alter the abundance of the other protein in atrial sarcomeres, affecting sarcomere localization and function. To test this, we engineered two constructs: a mini-C construct comprising thick filament-binding domains of cMyBP-C and a MyBP-HL construct. Selected MYBPC3 and MYBPHL missense variants were introduced and expressed in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs). Sarcomere localization was assessed by co-localization with endogenous cMyBP-C. MYBPC3 variants were selected across a range of pathogenicity, while MYBPHL variants were based on evolutionary conservation of residues. MYBPHL variants Gly275Ser, Arg285His, and Ala342Thr induced significant sarcomere mislocalization, and MYBPC3 variants Pro1181Ala and Asn1257Lys showed variable effects on sarcomere mislocalization. To assess stoichiometric effects, we developed a T2A/P2A polycistronic construct to co-express mini-C, Td-Tomato, and MyBP-HL. Immunoblotting and mass spectrometry confirmed consistent and reproducible expression. We identified several MYBPC3 and MYBPHL variants that reduced the affinity of their protein for myofilament incorporation.

Remarkably, gut IR loss persistently maintained normal body weight and glucose homeostasis, thereby allowing the specific role of insulin action to be investigated. While IR{Delta}GUT mice exhibited increased intestinal paracellular permeability, mechanistic characterization of this gut leakiness revealed that IR{Delta}GUT mice displayed a rapid and drastic decline in Paneth cells anti-microbial defenses. This paralleled the onset of a cecal dysbiosis, as characterized by increased abundance of Pseudomonadota, and enhanced microbiota encroachment. Of note, IR{Delta}GUT mice exhibited intestinal stem cell (ISC) defects, as evidenced by reduced expression of ISC markers and ISC-mediated growth of intestinal organoids. Although expression of niche factors such as Wnt3a was diminished in Paneth cells isolated from IR{Delta}GUT mice, pharmacological activation of the canonical Wnt pathway failed to rescue the growth defects of IR-deleted gut organoids. The direct contribution of IR-downstream signaling to ISCs homeostasis was confirmed by the transcriptional reprogramming of FACS-sorted ISCs from IR{Delta}ISC mice. Finally, while gut IR loss did not worsen endotoxemia or impaired glycemic control upon HFD-feeding, IR{Delta}GUT displayed a higher susceptibility to chemically induced colitis and enteric infections (S. typhimurium, C. rodentium), underscoring intestinal insulin signaling as a key determinant of barrier integrity and epithelial homeostasis.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Although the underlying molecular etiology of these pathological processes remains unclear, progressive aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) and mitochondrial dysfunction are two expected mechanisms implicated in neuronal degeneration. Accumulating evidence indicates that transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoflowers (NFs), a novel class of nanomaterials, can restore mitochondrial health by the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, therapeutic potential of TMD NFs in PD remains unclear. The current study investigates the neuroprotective properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoflowers (NFs) in neurons and astrocytes exposed to a-syn aggregates. It was found that MoS2 and MoSe2 suppressed a-syn-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum, and upregulated autophagy and exocytosis of a-syn fibrils. TMD NFs also reversed a-syn-induced damage of cell mitochondria, simultaneously stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis. As a result, a drastic decrease in ROS levels in both neurons and astrocytes was observed. These results show that MoS2 or MoSe2 NFs could fully rescue neurons and astrocytes from the cytotoxic effects of a-syn fibrils. Neuroprotective properties of these novel nanomaterials were further explored in Caenorhabditis elegans that overexpress a-syn. Nematodes that received NFs experienced a drastic reduction in the amount of aggregated a-syn which resulted in a significant increase in C. elegans lifespan. These findings indicated that MoS2 or MoSe2 NFs could be used as novel therapeutic to decelerate the progression of PD.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

G. H.", "abstract": "Activities with diminishing returns pose a unique computational problem for the brain, requiring a combination of outcome evaluation and temporal tracking. Deciding the right time to stop one pursuit and move to alternatives is an important part of effective time management, yet it is unknown how the decision-making circuits of the brain determine the moment to switch. The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) mediates both goal-directed decision-making and interval timing, two functions that converge during patch foraging, where animals must time when to exit patches to maximize reward rates. We recorded extracellular activity from neurons in DMS while freely moving mice performed a patch-foraging task. Mice employed a 'reward-reset' strategy, primarily basing their exit decisions on the time since the last reward, but with the patch residence time and environmental reward-rate context also contributing to the intended time of departure. Individual neurons in DMS underwent discrete firing rate transitions at characteristic delays following each reward. These transition delays were distributed across the population, creating a cumulative signal that reached a threshold coinciding with patch exit. This population activity pattern spanned the intended reward-to-exit interval, compressing or expanding in accordance with patch residence time and changing environmental conditions. Fiber photometry recordings revealed phasic dopamine signals in DMS encoding reward prediction errors that reflected the declining reward probability over time. Our results provide insights into how DMS integrates its dual roles in timing and action selection to guide time investment strategies during foraging.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed a comprehensive framework to quantify burst shapes, the time course of network firing during bursts. Applying this approach to four datasets, including rodent- and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cultures, we show that burst shapes contain rich information about the underlying network dynamics. We quantify this information by using traditional and shape features to classify the recording conditions (types of genetic disorder, presence of pharmacological agents) and demonstrate that shapes significantly increase classification accuracy.

While seroclearance of the surface antigen (HBsAg) defines clinical cure and reduces disease-associated risks, HBsAg clearance is rarely observed and remains therapeutically elusive. Here we overcome some of the challenges to studying immune mechanisms of HBsAg clearance in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) using our mouse model of age-dependent HBsAg clearance and persistence, and samples from our BeNEG-DO clinical trial that provided longitudinal PBMCs from patients who either cleared HBsAg or retained stable HBsAg levels after stopping nucleos(t)ide analog therapy. We show that young mice fail to clear HBsAg and have impaired ability to efficiently initiate and sustain HBV-specific CD4+ T cell responses. We also demonstrate a role for CD4+ T cells in hepatic leukocyte organization and cytotoxicity, and in HBV-specific CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity and HBsAg clearance. Upstream of the CD4+ T cell response, we reveal that hepatic dendritic cells, particularly cDC2s, direct effective CD4+ T cell activation and differentiation. Studies in CHB patients identified immune features of HBsAg clearance that overlap with the mouse model, including TH1 and cytotoxic CD4+ T cell activation and CD8+ T cell cytotoxic effector function.

As such, we sought to measure the effectiveness of a canonical cryopreservation strategy on the thickness and continuity of human cerebrovascular tissue. With the recent rise in biomechanical analyses of cerebrovascular tissue for the design of novel treatments and optimization of surgical strategies, the importance of designing models with accurate tissue proxies is paramount. Methods: Fresh, human cerebrovascular tissue was obtained through the Cleveland Clinic institutional cadaver donation program. Donors with prior craniotomy, intracranial malignancy, or history of cerebrovascular disease were excluded. Cadaveric tissue dissections were completed within fourteen days of patient expiration and sectioned into four specimens. The 164 tissue samples obtained from three donors were then randomized into one of the following experimental conditions: 10% formalin (control), distilled water (dH2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or -80 degree C DMSO cryopreservation. Specimens were then processed into paraffin-embedded sections and treated with Movat pentachrome staining. Vessel layers were measured by two blinded evaluators and discontinuities in internal elastin lamina were tallied. Results: We found that DMSO cryopreservation failed to consistently provide a protective effect to cerebrovascular specimens. Tissue stored via this method was reported to occasionally swell in specific vessel tunics of select vessel territories compared to formalin controls. We also observed an increase in the number of transverse elastin breaks with DMSO cryopreservation. Conclusions: This data demonstrates that conventional tissue preservation methods may fail to preserve layer thicknesses between some vessels and alter biomechanical properties for future testing. Further, with more frequent elastin fractures in the cryopreservation group, recoilability of preserved vessels may vary from in vivo counterparts.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for adequate management. Electroencephalography (EEG) has evolved into a promising non-invasive tool for detecting ScZ in contemporary research. However, specific biomarkers, especially those related to brain lobes, cannot often be identified by current EEG-based diagnostic methods. Different brain lobes are associated with distinct cognitive functions and patterns of diseases. Also, there is a gap in the incorporation of the XAI technique, as medical diagnosis needs trustworthiness and explainability. This study strives to address these gaps by developing a framework using mel-spectrogram images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). EEG signals are converted into mel-spectrogram images using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). After that, these images are analyzed using a CNN model to perform classification between ScZ and healthy control (HC). To identify the most critical brain regions, the full brain regions are divided into five different regions, and the same classification process is performed. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using two publicly available EEG datasets: repOD and the kaggle basic sensory task dataset, which provides a remarkable accuracy of 99.82% and 98.31% respectively. Among regions, the frontal lobe has the most significant performance with an accuracy of 97.02% and 88.03%, respectively, in these datasets, followed by the temporal lobe. Conversely, the occipital lobe shows the lowest accuracy among lobes, with only 79.30 % and 68.33% accuracy on both occasions, showing its lower significance in the diagnosis. To bring result explainability, LIME, SHAP, and the Grad-CAM methods are applied, providing valuable insights for clinicians and researchers.

Yet how tissue structure changes with aging remains largely unknown. Current aging research primarily focuses on molecular changes, missing this structural dimension. Here, we present PathStAR, Pathology based Structural Aging Rate, the first computational framework that captures when and how tissue structure changes during aging from histopathology images. We applied it to 25,306 postmortem tissues covering 40 tissue types from individuals aged 21 - 70, connecting structural aging to molecular data, health records and genotype data. Without any training on chronological age, PathStAR captured non-linear functional decline of ovary, undetectable by bulk-molecular profiling. Applying it across 40 tissues, it revealed that structural aging occurs through discrete phases of rapid change (accelerated periods), with tissue-specific trajectories following three patterns: Early Aging Tissues (vascular system with major changes during the 30s), Late Aging Tissues (uterus and vagina with major changes during menopause (50s)) and Biphasic Aging Tissues (digestive, male reproductive tissues, and ovary with two periods of major changes). During these accelerated phases, most tissues exhibited shared aging hallmarks of inflammation and energy production decline, coupled with disruption of pathways governing their specialized functions. Cross-organ analysis revealed coordinated aging within organ systems and an unexpected link between digestive and male reproductive tissues. We next identified 123 germline variants associated with organ-specific accelerated structural aging, including SIRT6 variants linked to accelerated vascular decline.

An important gap in knowledge is whether mice with diet-induced obesity respond to cold similarly to their lean counterparts. The goal of the present study was to compare the response to cold exposure between mice fed a standard (normal-fat) diet and a higher-fat diet. Methods: Male C56BL/6J mice fed a standard diet (13.1% fat) or a higher-fat diet (21.6% fat) during adulthood and exposed to cold (4-6oC) following different approaches. Body weight, body composition, food intake, rectal temperature, energy expenditure, and respiratory exchange ratio were assessed. Results: Cold exposure significantly increased energy expenditure and limited weight gain despite elevated food intake in mice fed either a standard or a higher-fat diet, while body composition, body temperature, and respiratory exchange ratio remained stable across both dietary groups. Moreover, energy expenditure measured at 4-6oC was comparable between mice fed standard and higher-fat diets, demonstrating that cold-induced thermogenesis may elicit a consistent metabolic response independent of dietary fat content.

The conserved, ancient target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is a central metabolic regulator in eukaryotes that integrates carbon and nitrogen to maintain homeostasis and promote growth and development through protein synthesis. While TOR regulatory mechanisms of amino acid accumulation are well known in yeast and mammals, they remain unknown in photosynthetic organisms. Here, we developed the unicellular green alga Chromochloris zofingiensis as a simpler model system for understanding TOR function. Multiomics experiments showed that TOR inhibition leads to an increase in amino acid levels independent of hexokinase-mediated glucose signaling. We observed upregulation of selective amino acid biosynthesis pathways at the transcript and protein levels as potential mechanisms driving the increase in amino acids. Transcriptomics and proteomics experiments identified a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor with rapid upregulation during TOR inhibition. DAP-seq analysis demonstrated that bHLH can bind directly to the promoters of amino acid biosynthesis genes, potentially regulating their transcription in response to TOR inhibition. We found high conservation of the bHLH-binding motif in the genomes of other green algae and plants, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism for amino acid biosynthesis across Viridiplantae. Phosphoproteomics experiments also revealed novel conserved targets that are not currently recognized as part of the TOR pathway.

However, there are limited tools for quantifying the mechanics and the malignancy of the tumor in a physiologically realistic setting. Here, we developed a microfluidic rheometer, termed the microrheometer, that enables simultaneous measurements of tumor spheroid mechanics and their invasiveness into a 3D extracellular matrix (ECM). The microrheometer consists of a pneumatic pressure control unit for applying controlled static or cyclic compression to tumor spheroids, and a sample chamber for containing spheroid embedded ECM. The innovation here lies in the integration of a polyacrylamide membrane force sensor within the sample chamber, enabling a direct force measurement in a physiologically relevant setting. We found that both tumor stiffness and the viscoelastic properties of the tumor are closely correlated with tumor invasiveness. The microrheometer allowed us to measure tumor mechanics in a short time (less than a minute) and has the potential to be used clinically in the future. We note that the microrheometer here can be easily extended to studies of mechanics of single cell, nucleus, as well as other cell/tissue types.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Although substantial efforts have been made to enhance prediction accuracy using data-driven approaches, progress remains limited by persistent data scarcity. The widely used PDBbind dataset, for example, contains fewer than 20,000 experimental structures with annotated binding affinities, while a vast number of affinity measurements remain underutilized due to missing structural data. Here, we investigate this untapped potential by curating more than 450,000 synthetic protein-ligand complexes annotated with Kd and Ki values using the Boltz-1 structure prediction model. Building on this unprecedented scale of synthetic data, further augmented with over 1 million synthetic complexes from the recently released SAIR database annotated with IC50 values, we develop GatorAffinity, a geometric deep learning-based scoring function pre-trained on large-scale synthetic data and fine-tuned using high-quality experimental structures from PDBbind. Extensive evaluation on a leak-proof benchmark demonstrates that GatorAffinity significantly outperforms state-of-the-art affinity prediction methods, offering superior accuracy and generalizability. Our findings show that augmenting available experimental data with synthetic complexes can effectively address the data scarcity challenge while maintaining strong predictive reliability.

However, identifying which biological pathways accurately reflect distinct cell types or continuous cellular trajectories remains a major challenge. Traditional methods often miss subtle or non-linear pathway activities, limiting biological interpretability and insights. To address this, we developed Phoenix, a pathway analysis framework that leverages random forest models and non-parametric significance testing to evaluate the relevance of functional gene sets for cell-type classification and pseudotemporal cellular trajectories. Phoenix reveals both up- and down-regulated processes, including those shaped by complex non-linear gene interactions, and quantifies their effect sizes. Applied to human and mouse hematopoiesis as well as zebrafish embryogenesis, Phoenix identified both cell-type-specific and trajectory-associated pathways, spanning housekeeping, developmental, and lineage-specific programs. It outperformed existing tools in capturing cell-type-specific activities and revealed greater overlap in pathway activities across species. By integrating statistical rigor with trajectory- and cell-type-aware analysis, Phoenix provides a sensitive, context-driven framework for uncovering biologically meaningful pathways in complex single-cell datasets, opening new opportunities to explore dynamic gene regulation across biological systems.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of tumor biology, but their role in KRAS-driven PDAC is not well defined. To address this gap, we integrated RNA sequencing, exome, and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified 49 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) differentially expressed according to KRAS status. Among the ten most abundant, LINC00941 and AC006262.5 showed the strongest differential expression in an independent PDAC cohort from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Experimental validation in KRAS-mutant PDAC cell lines and isogenic pancreatic epithelial models confirmed KRAS-dependent regulation of LINC00941, which was consistently upregulated in patient tumors and correlated with poor prognosis in both TCGA and ICGC datasets. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis further demonstrated that LINC00941 is enriched in malignant epithelial populations. Functional assays revealed that LINC00941 silencing impaired migration and invasion, reduced DNA repair capacity, and sensitized PDAC cells to gemcitabine, while having little effect on viability. Supporting these findings, co-expression and enrichment analyses linked LINC00941 to pathways regulating cell adhesion, motility, extracellular matrix organization, and DNA repair. Together, these findings demonstrate that oncogenic KRAS reshapes the lncRNA landscape in PDAC and identify LINC00941 as a KRAS-regulated oncogenic lncRNA that promotes aggressiveness and chemoresistance, highlighting its prognostic value and potential as a therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

In Ewing Sarcoma (EwS), these changes result from the activity of an oncogenic fusion transcription factor, EWS::FLI1, which alters the enhancer landscape and rewires transcriptional programs to promote oncogenic transformation. Among the targets directly activated by EWS::FLI1, NR0B1 has emerged as a potentially targetable transcription co-regulator and as a manifold for widespread alterations in downstream gene expression programs mediated by members of the ligand-inducible nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. We have dissected the gene regulatory activity of NR0B1 in EwS models, showing its role in altering the basal gene expression programs of nuclear receptors COUP-TFII, EAR2, RXRa, and TR4. Additionally, we show that NR0B1 impacts the EwS response to retinoids, particularly 9-cis-retinoic acid signaling in part through RXRa. Our findings suggest NR0B1 silencing or inhibition offer a means of achieving a more potent response to retinoids, which may activate differentiation programs, decrease EwS gene expression signatures, and limit in vitro transformation phenotypes. Taken together, our study presents evidence of NR0B1 acting canonically as a nuclear receptor co-regulator in EwS, revealing a potential pathway to treatment of this aggressive cancer by combining NR0B1 inhibition with therapeutic nuclear receptor ligands.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Despite the long success of this partnership in oligotrophic seas, coral reefs are in decline due to increasing threats from rising seawater temperatures and disease, both of which can lead to bleaching and mortality. In order to better understand the mechanisms that underpin this mutualism, it may be necessary to dismantle the coral-algal symbiosis. Previous studies have experimentally bleached corals using thermal stress, photosynthetic inhibitors (DCMU), and menthol. We compared lab-induced bleaching of staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis by menthol treatment to traditional thermal stress. The larger aim was to adapt existing bleaching protocols to this important coral species used in restoration as a guide for future studies. Bleaching in corals treated with menthol or exposed to elevated temperature stress (31{degrees}C) was monitored by measuring photosynthetic activity determined by Fv/Fm using pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorescence. Corals were also monitored for symbiont density and overall health using the CoralWatch Coral Health Chart card throughout the experiment. We found that A. cervicornis bleached in response to both menthol treatment and thermal stress, but menthol treatment was more effective at reducing algal symbiont photosynthetic capacity (Fv/Fm) without negatively affecting the health of the coral. Our results indicate that menthol treatment at 0.38 mM rendered staghorn coral aposymbiotic within fourteen days without any visual or physiological damage to the coral.

We firstly identified 1,073 metabolites, mainly flavonoids (30.8%) and phenolic acids (15.3%) in EBP.

While sinusoidal tACS (sin-tACS) delivers current at a constant amplitude, amplitude-modulated tACS (AM-tACS) uses a high-frequency carrier modulated by a low-frequency envelope. We systematically compared the acute effects of sin-tACS at theta (5 Hz), alpha (10 Hz), beta (20 Hz), and gamma (140 Hz) frequencies, and AM-tACS (140 Hz carrier frequency modulated at theta, alpha, or beta) on corticospinal excitability. Healthy participants received 2 mA peak-to-peak tACS to the primary motor hand area (M1HAND) via a bipolar montage (M1HAND-Pz). Each tACS block consisted of ten 30-second stimulation periods interleaved with 6-second pauses, followed by 11 minutes without stimulation. Corticospinal excitability was assessed during each block using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), delivered at the peak and trough of tACS. MEP amplitudes were generally larger at the trough. Only beta sin-tACS and theta AM-tACS significantly modulated corticospinal excitability. Beta sin-tACS increased MEP amplitudes in early stimulation epochs, while theta AM-tACS facilitated MEPs in later stimulation epochs and this facilitation persisted briefly after stimulation ended. Participants with stronger early responses to beta sin-tACS also tended to show greater delayed effects with theta AM-tACS. These excitability changes during tACS were not predicted by simulated electric field strength. A follow-up EEG experiment revealed that beta sin-tACS increased beta power over left sensorimotor cortex, while theta AM-tACS decreased beta power over midline parietal cortex. These EEG changes were restricted to tACS pauses. The results show that sin-tACS and AM-tACS can both modulate corticospinal excitability, but functional changes differ in temporal dynamics, frequency specificity, and cortical region engagement.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

To overcome this limitation, we developed a multisite microelectrode array with a pre-formed curved geometry, engineered to align perpendicularly with neuronal layers in deep anatomical targets regardless of their orientation. This interface integrates a polymer-based array, featuring 16 PEDOT:BF4-coated microelectrodes for robust signal acquisition, with a dissolvable silk stiffener for precise surgical insertion. The resulting device exhibited excellent electrical properties (avg. impedance 18 k{Omega}) and enabled accurate placement across the distinct neuronal layers of the ventral hippocampus CA1 region.

Here, we tracked eye gaze during WM for naturalistic images, and manipulated which image features were most task-relevant (visual or semantic). In two experiments, we found that the eyes carried out item-specific spatiotemporal gaze sequences during WM maintenance, retracing the scanpath from stimulus encoding. Therefore, gaze patterns during WM track the identity of complex, natural images held in mind. Moreover, the degree of such WM gaze reinstatement was stronger when the task prioritized visual detail, and ramped up in anticipation of the test probe. Oculomotor WM signals are therefore malleable to when and how the content will be used, indicating that distributed WM representations are prospectively-oriented and functionally flexible to situational needs.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Cytokine data from Luminex assays were compiled from Stanford clinical studies and after batch control filtering, the dataset included 181 healthy individuals (ages 4-97) and 27 symptomatic individuals (mostly confirmed influenza, ages 14-77). Ordinary least squares regression was applied to assess cytokine differences due to infection status, age, and their interaction, with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05. The results illustrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in infected individuals, with a trend of stronger effects in the young supported by comparison of intercepts between the regressions for the healthy and infected cohorts. The concept of inflammaging was also seen through several biomarkers with significant non-zero slopes in healthy cohorts that were not well-established in prior research.

Understanding the dynamic nature of developmental networks requires live imaging techniques capable of capturing real-time developmental processes in wild-type and mutant embryos as they are exposed to pharmacological perturbations. Vertebrate embryos undergo a sequential segmentation process along their major axis during early development, giving rise to bilateral somites from unsegmented tail tissue3,4. Earlier work discovered that segmentation is instructed by an oscillatory fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)/ERK signalling5,6 gradient sourced from the tailbud7,8. Fgf/ERK signal oscillations are driven by a molecular oscillator called \"the segmentation clock\" 9. This peculiar patterning process was recapitulated at will in the absence of the molecular clock via pulsatile drug inhibitions5. Here, we present a live imaging setup for zebrafish embryos that incorporates a 3-D-printed chamber and a programmed syringe pump for precise, automated, periodic drug delivery. The chamber secures the orientation of zebrafish embryos in agarose inserts and incorporates inflow and outflow ports to facilitate controlled drug perfusion. Servo motors controlled by an Arduino were integrated to automate valve switching, achieving fully automated exchange of two different fluids for alternating drug delivery and rinse cycles. Such periodic delivery of an inhibitor drug entrains the Fgf/ERK signalling gradient in the embryonic tail to oscillate in clock-deficient mutants, creating lab-induced somites in otherwise defective embryos. Embryos expressing fluorescent markers can further be imaged at single-cell resolution during perturbations. Overall, this system provides a cost-effective, reproducible platform for investigating vertebrate development and interrogating cellular decision-making under controlled experimental conditions.

For pure drift and natural selection case, the Dirac {delta} singularity will develop at two boundary ends and the mass lumped at the two ends stands for the fixation probability. For the one-way mutation case, known as Muller's ratchet, the accumulation of deleterious mutations leads to the loss of the fittest gene, the Dirac {delta} singularity will spike only at one boundary end, which stands for the fixation of the deleterious gene and loss of the fittest one. For two-way mutation case, the singularity with negative power law may emerge near boundary points. We first rewrite the original model on the probability density function (PDF) to one with respect to the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Dirac {delta} singularity of the PDF becomes the discontinuity of the CDF. Then we establish a revised finite difference method(rFDM), which keeps the total probability, is positivity-preserving and unconditionally stable. For pure drift, the scheme also keeps the conservation of expectation. It can catch the discontinuous jump of the CDF, then predicts accurately the fixation probability for pure drift with or without natural selection and one-way mutation. For two-way mutation case, it can catch the power law of the singularity. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the scheme. We also compare rFDM with a standard finite difference method(sFDM).

To address these limitations, we propose MuH-MDS, a novel multiscale algorithm for hyperbolic multidimensional scaling that uses \"adiabatic\" approximation from physics to optimize local positions while keeping cluster centroid fixed. MuH-MDS improves computing time by 10^3 compared to previous methods and is able to handle large datasets comprising over 80,000 samples. We validate the method on a number of datasets, including a large-scale C. elegans embryogenesis scRNA-seq dataset with over 80,000 samples. Here, MuH-MDS uncovers intrinsic hierarchical structure, and achieves improved pseudotime inference and lineage analysis compared to UMAP and other methods. Unlike UMAP and t-SNE, which emphasize local structure at the expense of global coherence and metric accuracy, MuH-MDS preserves global hierarchy in a metrically faithful manner, maintaining key relationships across scales.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Once cancer acquires therapy resistance, it becomes the main driver of cancer lethality in patients. Thus, mechanisms of therapy resistance must be investigated to improve patient outcomes. Mitochondria are critical organelles in the cellular stress responses, undergoing dynamic morphological and functional changes in response to external stimuli. We and others have identified a chemotherapy-resistant cancer cell state where cells that survive treatment exhibit a dramatic increase in cell size and remain non-proliferative for weeks. In this study, we demonstrate that cancer cells that enter this resistant cell state in response to cisplatin increase OMA1 activity and decrease mitochondrial fusion and function to combat oxidative stress. These findings contribute to further understanding the role of the mitochondrial stress responses in therapy resistance in cancer and provide a potential therapeutic avenue to targeting cancer cells that enter this chemotherapy-resistant cell state.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

M.; Chen, I. Y.; Hutcheson, J. D.", "abstract": "Aortic valve disease (AVD) is asymmetric. Various clinical reports indicate that the non-coronary cusp (NCC) is disproportionally burdened by pathological remodeling like inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification. This has long been attributed to differences in hemodynamic load that arise from the presence, or lack thereof, of coronary ostia in respective sinuses. However, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that differences in hemodynamic shear alone are enough to drive the pathological remodeling observed. C57BL/6J mice exhibit high variance in right coronary ostium (RCO) positioning with respect to the right coronary cusp (RCC). Through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a mouse aortic valve (AoV) during end diastolic loading, we show negligible differences in wall shear stress (WSS) between a high RCO on the RCC and no ostium on the NCC. Also, though CFD analyses depict at least an order of magnitude difference in WSS through physiologically relevant ostia positions within the sinuses, ostium position does not correlate with calcification burden in a CKD mouse model of calcific AVD. Cusp dependent extracellular matrix (ECM) abundance analysis reveals asymmetric collagen and elastin content in healthy adult mice, but this does not follow the same trend as pathological remodeling. Instead, asymmetric abundance of elastin (P=0.034) and collagen (P=0.018) was mainly driven by increased ECM proteins in the left coronary cusp (LCC) with no differences in leaflet thickness. Cusp dependent transcriptomic (spatial and bulk RNA sequencing) analyses reveal asymmetric phenotypic profiles between the three cusps in healthy adult mice. Of note, genes associated with vascular smooth muscle contraction and modulators of AoV remodeling were upregulated in the NCC and downregulated in both the RCC and LCC. Together, these data suggest that differences in shear from coronary ostia are not sufficient to explain asymmetric onset of calcific AVD.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

The present study aimed to investigate the metabolomic and molecular alterations in sesame plants as a consequence of phytoplasma infection in two distinct tissue types, leaves and flowers, using a multi-omics approach. Results The study revealed that phytoplasma infection significantly alters the expression of floral homeobox and meristem identity genes in an antagonistic manner, resulting in the development of leaf-like traits in floral tissues. Integrated analyses of transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets showed that control leaves, control flowers, infected leaves, and infected flowers each displayed distinct metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles. Metabolomic profiling demonstrated major changes in pathways such as porphyrin metabolism, brassinosteroid metabolism, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Complementary KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of transcriptome data confirmed strong enrichment of secondary metabolite biosynthesis in both tissue types upon infection. Tissue-specific responses were evident. Floral tissues accumulated green pigments due to increased porphyrin biosynthesis and reduced degradation, while leaves showed simultaneous upregulation of both biosynthesis and breakdown pathways of porphyrins. Floral tissues exhibited stronger stress-associated responses, including upregulation of genes related to stress enzymes, phenylpropanoids, and lignification-related metabolites. In contrast, certain compounds such as lignans were specifically accumulated in leaves upon infection. These observations were further supported by biochemical, histological, and qRT-PCR assays. Conclusion This study provides the first clear evidence of tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming in sesame under Ca.

EPP1 is recruited to the activated SYMRK receptor, where it is phosphorylated on a key serine residue, an event essential and sufficient to propagate symbiotic signaling. We provide structural and functional validation of the SYMRK-EPP1 signaling complex and demonstrate that EPP1 is required for root nodule formation.

Two elite public soybean varieties, carrying either rhg1-a + Rhg4 or rhg1-b, negatively impacted Pp populations measured at 30 dpi. This contribution of Rhg1 was more rigorously demonstrated using near isogenic lines for rhg1-b. Additionally, in three of the four soybean SCN-susceptible genotypes tested we observed significantly more Pp when Pp were co-inoculated with SCN, consistent with a previous study. No significant changes in SCN cyst numbers upon co-inoculation with Pp were observed for any of the rhg1 resistant lines. No nematode-induced changes in Rhg1 transcript abundances were observed when sampling infected root sections in any of the plant genotypes, and no changes in a jasmonate response indicator were observed. However, the 3 dpi salicylate-mediated response to SCN or Pp became more robust during SCN + Pp co-infection.

Rapid and reliable potency assessment is hindered by limited mechanistic understanding of delivery processes and sparse experimental data. To address these challenges, we present a mechanism-informed, multi-scale kinetic modeling framework that quantitatively captures the coupled dynamics across particle-level, cellular, and macroscopic scales. This model incorporates variability in LNP-cell interactions and accounts for critical factors such as dosage, LNP and cell size distributions, and cell proliferation dynamics, all of which influence delivery efficiency and response variability.

Given evidence of structural and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) abnormalities in BD, investigating dynamic structure-function connectivity coupling (SC-FC coupling) may provide insights into the pathophysiology of the disorder. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state fMRI data were collected from 61 euthymic BD-I patients and 54 healthy controls (HC). Structural connectivity was derived using probabilistic tractography, and dFC was estimated with a sliding-window approach. SC-FC coupling was quantified as the extent to which structural features predicted dFC using multivariate linear regression. Abnormal SC-FC coupling in BD was assessed at both the network and regional levels, relative to HC. Over time, SC-FC coupling was categorized into high- and low-coupling states, and dynamic state analyses of dwell time, occurrence rate, and transition probabilities were performed in the affected brain regions. Results: Network-level analyses indicated that BD exhibits lower SC-FC coupling in subcortical regions compared with HC. Regional analyses revealed significantly reduced dynamic SC-FC coupling in two thalamic subregions (medial posterior and rostral temporal) and in the right primary somatosensory cortex in BD compared to HC. Dynamic analyses further demonstrated thalamic instability: BD showed shorter dwell times in high-coupling states, increased occurrence of low-coupling states, and more frequent high-to-low coupling transitions than HC. These abnormalities suggest that BD is characterized by disrupted structure-function integration and unstable thalamocortical dynamics. Conclusion: Our findings reveal regional abnormalities in SC-FC coupling dynamics in BD, indicating persistent dysfunction of structure-function integration during euthymia.

A.; Lee, B.; Ray, R.", "abstract": "Joint pain is an increasing concern for our aging population, as current therapies to slow joint disease progression or reduce pain are largely ineffective and often carry significant health and dependency risks. Age and joint disease induce changes to all tissues that make up the joint, including the dense neural network that innervates the joint. Several studies have correlated some joint innervation changes in joint diseases such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, but little is known about their respective functional consequences. In general, knee innervating neurons are classified as either non/peptidergic nociceptive or sympathetic neurons. How subtypes of these neurons affect individual pain experience remains relatively uncharacterized. The few studies typically focused on a single neural subtype due to the limited availability of validated tools to study joint innervation1-5. To better understand the relationship between aging, joint disease, and pain, systematic characterization of pain nociceptors and other neural subtypes that regulate joint homeostasis and pain signaling is urgently needed. The objective of this study was to establish a validated molecular and genetic toolbox for accurate mapping of the neuroarchitecture in the murine knee. We screened a panel of genetic reporter mice, consisting of Cre and Flp recombinase driver mouse lines that activate recombinase responsive reporter alleles in either peripheral nociceptors or post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons, for their specificity and accuracy in labeling their respective neural subtype in the dorsal root ganglion and knee joint. In addition, we compared the performance of a series of conventional retrograde tracers for effective tracking of primary afferent sensory and post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons from the knee joint. The validated molecular and genetic tools identified in this study will facilitate the creation of comprehensive joint innervation maps in physiological and pathological contexts, setting the stage for identifying the cellular and molecular changes responsible for mediating joint pain, a necessary goal for improved therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Polymerisation proceeds via self-association of monomeric intermediate states. In parallel, >50% of synthesised Z alpha-1-antitrypsin is instead recognized as terminally-misfolded and degraded. It is unclear whether this contributes to Z alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease. We characterised the relationships between polymer formation, terminal misfolding and their cellular consequences, using ion-mobility and label-free proteomics mass spectrometry, light and electron microscopy, and cellular assays. IM-MS findings supported the relationship between polymerisation propensity of different variants and expansion of the protein consistent with opening of its beta-sheet A. Proteomic analyses of well-established CHO cell models of hepatocyte handling of alpha-1-antitrypsin variants indicated that cellular responses to the Z mutation were surprisingly similar to those seen with the NullHongKong variant (NHK), which can only misfold terminally and cannot polymerise. A minor set of proteins showed increases associated with Z and not NHK alpha-1-antitrypsin expression, consistent with a polymer-specific response, characterized by association with increased organellar organization and vesicle-mediated transport. Conversely, proteostatic and pro-fibrotic integrin-associated pathways increased with terminal misfolding tendency of the expressed alpha-1-antitrypsin variant. Bioenergetic pathway changes indicated concomitant switching from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism. Cell studies further correlated fibrosis-associated behaviours with terminal misfolding rather than polymerisation. Terminal misfolding, as well as polymerisation behaviour, may therefore be important for pro-fibrotic responses including metabolic reprogramming and senescence in Z alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Molecular therapies may prove most efficacious for associated liver disease if they address terminal misfolding as well as polymerisation consequences.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Currently, little is known regarding the intracellular trafficking of effectors enroute to secretion. In this study, we developed a robust density gradient ultracentrifugation method to isolate intracellular vesicles from P. infestans and to separate diverse vesicle populations based on buoyancy for the purpose of identifying vesicle-associated proteins by mass spectrometry. Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis of proteins identified in buoyant fractions revealed enrichment for membrane-associated proteins and proteins involved in vesicle trafficking. Buoyant fractions were also enriched in RXLR class effectors, carbohydrate-active enzymes, and secretory proteins possessing N-terminal signal peptides, all representing potential vesicle cargo. In addition, previously identified P. infestans extracellular vesicle markers were also present.

Here, we screened mutations of all non-essential E. coli genes and identified 151 E. coli mutants that mitigate let-60/Ras(gf)-induced vulval developmental abnormalities in C. elegans. Interestingly, bacteria with mutations in genes involved in iron acquisition suppress host Ras(gf)-induced vulval defects through elevating 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, a bacterial siderophore that sequesters iron. Consequently, host mitochondrial iron availability is decreased, which prompts the nuclear accumulation of the chromatin modifier LIN-65 and then downregulates lin-3/EGF transcription to repress Ras(gf)-induced vulval defects.

Using this dataset, we investigate assemblage composition, temporal activity patterns, and the state of regional biodiversity sampling. Results: Sequencing DNA from 95,996 individuals captured using Malaise, yellow pan, pitfall, Heath and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) traps, we identified 10,120 unique BINs. The rate of species accumulation did not approach an asymptote for any taxonomic group or trap type, indicating high biodiversity. The different trap types sampled different subsets of the local community, with greatest similarity between yellow pan and pitfall traps. More insects and species (BINs) were trapped during the day than at night. Our dataset shared more BINs in the Barcode of Life Database with South Africa than with any other country, although this predominantly reflects the limited sampling and DNA sequencing campaigns in Africa.

We evolved six replicate diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations for 1,200 generations in glucose or galactose and quantified fitness every 300 generations under controlled history manipulations. Whole-genome sequencing across four time points per population revealed that adaptation was dominated by copy-number variations (CNVs), with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rare across lines and time. CNVs were strongly environment-specific: glucose-evolved populations showed early, widespread telomeric deletions encompassing carbon-use modules, followed by a reduction of deletion burden and appearance of compensatory duplications; galactose-evolved populations accumulated persistent telomeric and sub-telomeric duplications. Many of the same genes were targeted in opposite directions across environments (deleted in glucose, duplicated in galactose), linking structural remodeling to divergent physiological strategies. History-dependent fitness costs were pronounced early for glucose-evolved lines after galactose preculture but diminished by ~900 generations, whereas costs deepened in galactose-evolved lines after glucose preculture. A linear modeling framework identified ancestral fitness as the strongest predictor of evolved fitness, with evolutionary time contributing modestly and preconditioning/recovery exerting subtle, time-dependent effects.

Using in-silico simulations, we evaluated the framework under a range of experimental conditions and compared its performance with a conventional rate calculation method. We further analyzed the influence of key experimental design parameters - sampling frequency, sample volume, and measurement noise - on both rate estimation accuracy and concentration reconstruction quality. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework delivers accurate, robust metabolic rate estimates even under severe data sparsity and noise, offering a powerful tool for improving bioprocess characterization and optimization.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

The 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) is a key regulator of translation initiation efficiency, prompting the question of whether a simple and portable modification could enhance expression across diverse designs. Here, we systematically engineered short repeats of the Kozak ''core'' motif (5'-GCCACC-3') immediately upstream of the start codon and evaluated constructs incorporated into two widely used human UTRs (APO and HBB) in HeLa and HEK293T cells. Translation enhancement displayed a non-monotonic dependence on the number of Kozak repeats, with three repetitions consistently outperforming the native sequence and any other configuration. In mice, intramuscular lipid nanoparticle delivery of the three-copy design increased luciferase expression by {approx}4-fold relative to the wild-type context and by up to {approx}23-fold compared to a licensed vaccine UTR benchmark, providing clear in vivo relevance. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuning AUG-proximal Kozak elements constitutes a broadly applicable, UTR-independent strategy to enhance translation efficiency, offering a simple yet powerful principle for dose-sparing mRNA design in therapeutic applications.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

However, these tasks are complicated by the unique nature of time-to-event data, which captures both the occurrence and timing of clinical events. Notably, complex associations such as the non-linear and non-additive biomarker interactions and the high-dimensionality challenge conventional survival data modeling approaches. To address these difficulties, we propose SurvDNN, an enhanced deep neural network framework specifically designed for survival outcomes modeling. SurvDNN incorporates a bootstrapping-based regularization strategy to mitigate overfitting and a novel stability-driven filtering algorithm to improve model robustness. To enable interpretable biomarker discovery, we extend the Permutation-based Feature Importance Test (PermFIT) to survival settings, allowing rigorous quantification of individual biomarker contributions under complex biomarker-outcome associations. Through extensive simulations and applications to real-world datasets, SurvDNN consistently outperforms existing machine learning approaches in both biomarker identification and predictive accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of SurvDNN coupled with PermFIT as an interpretable, robust, and powerful tool for biomarker-driven survival modeling in complex diseases.

However, they face two major challenges: data explosion with high experimental costs, and data complexity characterized by high dimensionality, noise, sparsity, and heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we developed the single-cell Rank-based Genetic Perturbation predictor (scRGP), the first deep learning framework leveraging gene expression rank-order information for this task. scRGP demonstrates superior performance in terms of robustness, cross-cell-line perturbation prediction, and high-throughput screening. Specifically, scRGP achieves an approximately 10-16 percentage points improvement in Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) over state-of-the-art methods (e.g., GEARS and scFoundation) for single- and double-gene perturbation predictions, while also extending prediction capability to triple-gene perturbations.

G.; Schuster, C. D.", "abstract": "Hemoglobin (Hb), a well-characterized protein central to oxygen transport and molecular medicine, serves as a model for studying how sequence variations influence protein structure and function. Its precise activity depends on tightly regulated structural dynamics, which can be disrupted by mutations that give rise to structural hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease, unstable hemoglobins, methemoglobins, and hemoglobins with altered oxygen affinity, each associated with distinct functional and clinical consequences. Among genetic variants, missense mutations are the most widely studied in clinical settings. Accurately predicting their clinical impact remains challenging, requiring integration of evolutionary, biochemical, and structural data. While broad deep learning models like AlphaMissense show promise, they often lack interpretability and protein-specific precision. This motivates the development of focused models that leverage detailed knowledge of individual proteins, like hemoglobin, to improve both predictive power and mechanistic understanding. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of all known and potential human adult hemoglobin (HbA) variants, guided by the hypothesis that a deep understanding of the sequence structure function relationship in Hb can yield interpretable and predictive insights into the functional and clinical consequences of single amino acid substitutions. We curated an updated dataset of HbA variants annotated with their clinical classifications, Benign, Pathogenic, or of Uncertain Significance (VUS), and systematically mapped each to a range of features, including structural location and classification, predicted impact on folding stability, and evolutionary conservation. Using this data, we developed a pathogenicity prediction model and benchmarked it against AlphaMissense, demonstrating strong and complementary performance. Additionally, we generated a complete mutational landscape of all possible single amino acid substitutions (SAS) in HbA, providing a resource for future clinical interpretation. Our findings provide insight into the molecular basis for variant effects in HbA and highlight the utility of combining structure-informed features with Machine Learning (ML) for variant interpretation.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant parasite strains has necessitated the exploration of novel therapeutic targets, among which DNA gyrase represents a unique and underexploited enzyme in the parasites replication machinery. Plasmodium falciparum DNA gyrase A (pfDNA gyrase), an essential topoisomerase II that is not present in humans, has been identified as a promising target for antimalarial drug development. Present study deals with a structure based computational approach to characterize the binding mechanism and dynamic stability of three bioactive withanolide derivatives (D, E, and O) against pfDNA gyrase. Molecular docking revealed high binding affinities for withanolide D (-9.14kcal/mol), E (-9.73kcal/mol), and O (-9.00kcal/mol), with interactions mediated through key catalytic residues such as GLU648, LYS647, and TRY590 via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts. Stability of the ligand-protein complexes was further assessed through molecular dynamics simulations, where analyses of RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) analysis confirmed the structural integrity and compactness of the complexes, notably withanolide O exhibited the most favorable dynamic profile, whereas withanolide E induced confirmational rigidity. MM/GBSA calculations are further supported by showing the lowest binding free energy for withanolide O and E ({Delta}Gbind =-20.89 and -20.22 kcal/mol). The ADME studies showed favorable pharmacokinetic and physiochemical properties of three ligands.

In this study, we developed an in silico protocol that integrates multi-structure covalent docking and machine learning (ML) consensus scoring to improve the prediction of AChE inhibitors. We analyzed 65 ligand-bound (holo) human AChE crystal structures using hierarchical clustering to identify four representative conformations, along with one high-resolution apo structure, for multi-structure docking. A curated library of 412 organophosphate and carbamate inhibitors was then docked covalently and non-covalently into each receptor conformation. The resulting docking scores were evaluated against inhibitors' experimental logIC50 values using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (). Covalent docking outperformed non-covalent docking ( values up to 0.54 vs 0.18), and our ML consensus model trained on the five structures' covalent docking scores achieved the highest predictive accuracy ( = 0.70), surpassing all single-structure and conventional consensus baselines. Chemical cluster analysis revealed structure-activity trends based on ligand flexibility, polarity, and aromaticity. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis highlighted the ML consensus model's ability to flexibly distribute the influence each structure's scores played on its predictions.

A major and stable quantitative trait locus (QTL) explaining a large percentage (40%) of phenotypic variation for several medium-chain esters (MCE) was mapped at about 19 Mb in chromosome 6A using both a biparental population and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Subcellular localization experiments indicated that FaCCR1(6A) and FaOCT4(6A) localize at the cytosol and tonoplast membrane respectively. Transient overexpression of FaCCR1(6A) and FaOCT4(6A) in fruits resulted in a significant increase in MCE content. Despite the well-described function of CCRs in the biosynthesis of monolignols, in vitro enzymatic assays and molecular docking revealed that FaCCR1(6A) also presents high affinity for MCE precursors, indicating a previously unidentified function of this protein in volatile biosynthesis.

It has long been suggested that plant defense activity must be linked to cellular energy and metabolic states to optimize the balance between growth and defense.

Here, we demonstrate that the plant energy sensor SNF1-RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) plays a critical role in modulating defense responses and bacterial resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Bacterial elicitor-induced expression of defense marker genes, such as PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1 (PR1), is significantly repressed under sugar-limited conditions in wild-type seedlings, whereas this expression is markedly enhanced in the snrk1 knockdown mutants. SnRK1 restricts defense-related gene expression and resistance to the biotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringe pv. tomato DC3000, which are partly dependent on salicylic acid (SA). In addition, we found that the SnRK1 kinase activity is increased by high humidity. Consistently, SnRK1 is critical for the suppression of SA-mediated defense responses under high humidity conditions. SnRK1 physically associates with the SA-related transcription factors TGACG SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC BINDING PROTEIN 4 (TGA4) and TGA2 to attenuate PR1 expression.

In situ B chromosome visualisation, complemented by transcriptomic profiling and gene-enrichment analysis, allowed us to identify 28 candidate genes potentially linked to chromosome elimination. We show that elimination is a developmentally programmed process, peaking during mid-embryogenesis and nearly completed at later stages, leaving B chromosomes only in restricted meristematic regions. Genome sequencing revealed that the sorghum B chromosome is of multi-A chromosomal origin, has reduced gene density, is enriched in repetitive sequences, and carries a novel centromeric repeat (SpuCL166). Transcriptome analyses identified B-specific variants of kinetochore, cohesion, and checkpoint genes that are expressed during active elimination, while structural modeling of CENH3 and CENP-C indicated functional divergence at the kinetochore interface. Here, we provide the first comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic characterization of B chromosome and its elimination in Sorghum purpureosericeum.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in modulating these metabolic adaptations. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which make up a large portion of the TME, have been shown to strongly contribute to metabolic reprogramming in CRC. This study applies flux sampling, a computational method that explores the full range of feasible metabolic states, combined with representation learning and hierarchical clustering, to a computational model of central carbon metabolism to understand how CAFs influence metabolic adaptations of KRAS-mutant CRC cells following targeted enzyme knockdowns. Focusing on twelve key enzymes involved in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, knockdowns were simulated under both normal CRC media and CAF-conditioned media (CCM) conditions. Analysis revealed that CCM induces greater metabolic heterogeneity, with knockdown models exhibiting more variable and distinct metabolic states compared to those cultured in normal CRC media. While some enzyme knockdowns produced similar metabolic states, this overlap was less frequent in CCM, indicating that CAF-derived factors diversify the metabolic responses of CRC cells to enzyme perturbations. Pathway-level flux analysis demonstrated media-specific shifts in central carbon metabolism pathways. Importantly, the predicted biomass flux showed that enzyme knockdowns reduced growth across both conditions, but models in the CCM condition indicated CAFs could offer a protective effect against metabolic perturbation. Overall, this study reveals that CCM significantly influences the metabolic state and adaptability of KRAS-mutant CRC cells to enzyme perturbations, emphasizing the importance of including TME components in metabolic modeling and therapeutic development. These findings provide valuable insights into the metabolic adaptability of CRC and suggest that targeting tumor-CAF metabolic interactions may improve treatment strategies.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we resolve this by creating a multimodal functional blueprint of the forceps major (FMA), the principal component of the visual callosum, in humans and mice. By combining ultra-high-field 7T fMRI with Bayesian population receptive field (pRF) modeling in humans, we directly test the competing hypotheses: segregated streams should manifest as voxels dominated by single pRFs, whereas integrated signals would produce voxels with multiple pRFs. Our results reveal a functionally segregated architecture dominated by single pRFs (expected probability 0.92), forming parallel streams that represent the contralateral (87.7%) and distinct ipsilateral (12.3%) visual field. In contrast, integrative dual pRFs are sparse and localized to the cortical boundary, reflecting the localized convergence of bilateral axons. This organizational principle is anatomically corroborated at the mesoscale in the mouse, where dual-color neuronal viral tracing and whole-brain light sheet microscopy imaging reveal a complementary laminar segregation of callosal fibers.

However, we also observed striking sex differences in T cell cytokine production in these strains. At 24 h post activation, in comparison to male BPH/2 mice, activated T cells from male BPN/3 mice secreted more IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22 and TNF. In contrast to male mice, less than half of these cytokines were different between strains in female mice. We also noted marked differences in early Th17 cytokine production in which IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 were greater in the male, but not female, BPN/3 groups. Taken together, the data suggest that polyclonally activated T cells from male, and to a much lesser extent, female BPH/2 mice have a weaker cytokine response as compared to T cells from BPN/3 mice which may be due to an overall attenuated activation of T cells from male BPH/2 mice. Overall, while there are striking differences in T cell response between the BPH2 and BPN/3 strains in male mice, the data indicate far fewer differences between the strains in female mice.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Nectin-4 is a cell adhesion molecule expressed at different levels in many solid tumors, including breast and urothelial carcinoma (UC). Enfortumab vedotin (EV), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) against Nectin-4, has significantly improved survival in patients with metastatic UC. Skin adverse reactions are frequently observed due to Nectin-4 expression in the epidermis. Here, we developed second-generation CAR T cells against Nectin-4 (N4CART) with a scFv that does not recognize human Nectin-4 expressed in skin keratinocytes. To study the effects of N4CART cell therapy, we used preclinical models of cell-derived xenografts (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) of breast cancer expressing moderate to high levels of Nectin-4. We showed a marked efficacy with induction of remissions. Interestingly, N4CART cells kill Nectin-4-positive breast, urothelial and colon tumor cells, which are resistant to EV. Thus, N4CART cells represent a valuable and safe therapy for the treatment of patients with Nectin-4 expressing tumors, including those that are resistant to EV. Finally, baboon-envelope pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (LV) outperformed VSVG-LVs for Nectin-4 CAR expressing in {beta} T cells resulting in an efficient anti-tumoral response in PDX mice.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

The poor prognosis of patients with liver metastases is associated with a systemic increase in neutrophils. Using experimental models, we confirm that mice with liver metastases respond poorly to CPI, have elevated neutrophils and suppress the response of subcutaneous lesions to CPI. We demonstrate that liver metastases, acting partly via IL-6, boost granulopoiesis in the spleen and promote the generation of immature S100A9hi neutrophils that suppress T-cell proliferation. Human liver metastases exhibit a similar increase in S100A9hi neutrophils. Neutrophil depletion attenuates the growth of liver metastases, but not subcutaneous metastases. Moreover, genetic deletion of S100A9 enables liver metastases to be effectively treated with CPI, and prevents liver metastases from suppressing the response in subcutaneous metastases.

However, how the gut microbiota plays an oncogenic role in HCC remains largely unknown. Here, we show that Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is highly enriched in liver tumor tissues and is positively correlated with pathogenesis of HCC. E. faecalis promotes liver cancer cell proliferation, protein translation, cell migration and tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, we found that EF-derived extracellular vesicles (EF-EVs) deliver EF-Obg GTPase to activate host mTOR, thereby promoting liver cancer progression. Intriguingly, the EF-Obg protein exerts its influence on the mTOR pathway via a Ras-like G domain involved in GTP binding. EF-Obg exhibits a striking homology with the G1 site of the G domain of Rheb, a key positive regulator of mTOR. Obg gene is critical for E. faecalis to activate mTOR to promote hepatocarcinogenesis based on an engineered obg knockdown strain by CRISPR interference experiment. Clinically, abundant EF-Obg protein expression is correlated with enhanced activation of mTOR, leading to poor overall survival in HCC patients. Significantly, treatment of mTOR inhibitor Everolimus confers effectiveness in EF-colonized liver cancer orthotopic model, suggesting that Everolimus therapeutic approach can be effective for liver cancer patients with enriched E. faecalis. Taken together, we provide mechanistic and functional evidence to verify a direct causal relationship between tumor-resident E. faecalis enrichment and liver carcinogenesis, revealing that EF-Obg functions as a previously unidentified cross-kingdom activator of mTOR to promote liver tumorigenesis.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 2-8% of pregnancies and is marked by placental hypoxia and HIF-pathway activation, especially in early-onset PE (eoPE). Integrating patient tissue analyses with experimental models may reveal common molecular markers of trophoblast hypoxic response. Methods. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 10 eoPE, 7 late-onset PE (loPE), and corresponding control placentas, identifying villous cytotrophoblast (VCT), syncytiotrophoblast (SCT), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) subpopulations. BeWo b30 cells were treated for 24 h with CoCl2 (300 M) or an oxyquinoline derivative (OD, 5 M) to induce hypoxia. RNA and small RNA sequencing quantified mRNA and microRNA changes. PROGENy inferred pathway activities. Results. Single-cell analysis revealed highest hypoxia pathway activation in eoPE, with EVT showing maximum activity among trophoblast populations. Nine genes were upregulated across all trophoblast types in eoPE: EBI3, CST6, FN1, RFK, COL17A1, LDHA, PKP2, RPS4Y1, and RPS26. In vitro, OD induced more specific hypoxia responses than CoCl2, with 1,284 versus 3,032 differentially expressed genes respectively. Critically, EBI3, FN1, and COL17A1 showed concordant upregulation in both placental tissue and OD-treated cells, while CoCl2 treatment produced opposite expression patterns. MicroRNA analysis identified hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-193b-5p as consistently elevated in both experimental conditions and previously reported in PE placental vesicles. We also identified isoforms of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-92b-3p as hypoxia-associated in trophoblast. Conclusions. EBI3, COL17A1, hsa-miR-27a-5p, and hsa-miR-193b-5p emerge as trophoblast hypoxia markers in PE. Oxyquinoline derivatives offer a more physiologically relevant in vitro hypoxia model than CoCl2.

Whole-genome sequencing of 3,102 individuals reveals that these traits are largely controlled by few loci of major effect with partially overlapping architectures. Temporal allele frequency analyses show subtle but consistent shifts at these loci.

We use artificial selection to investigate the evolutionary response of clonal reproduction in the common monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus), a species with extensive life history variation. We first characterize the standing genetic variation in a single perennial population, and then conduct four generations of divergent artificial selection on stolon number - the mechanism of clonal reproduction in this species. To start, stolon number had moderate heritability (H2=0.25) and was negatively genetically correlated with reproductive traits. Artificial selection produced a clear but asymmetrical response. High selection lines made significantly more stolons, while low lines diverged less from controls. Analyses of G matrices revealed that selection not only changed trait means but also genetic correlations, with high lines diverging more in multivariate genetic architecture. Our results demonstrate that single populations harbor sufficient genetic variation to respond rapidly to selection on clonality, and the response is shaped by existing patterns of genetic covariation. The capacity for rapid evolution of clonal traits is particularly relevant as climate change alters selection and shifts the relative advantages of sexual versus clonal life-history strategies.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

The kidney's complex cellular architecture and dynamic microenvironments further complicate integration of large-scale single-cell and spatial omics data, where current frameworks trained on limited datasets struggle to correct batch effects, capture cross-modality variation, and generalize across species. Methods: We developed Nephrobase Cell+, the first kidney-focused large foundation model, pretrained on ~100 billion tokens from ~39.5 million single-cell and single-nucleus profiles across 4,319 samples, four mammalian species (human, mouse, rat, pig), and multiple assay modalities (scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics). Nephrobase Cell+ uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with gene-token cross-attention and a mixture-of-experts module for scalable representation learning. Results: Nephrobase Cell+ sets a new benchmark for kidney single-cell analysis. It produces tightly clustered, biologically coherent embeddings in human and mouse kidneys, far surpassing previous foundation models such as Geneformer, scGPT, and UCE, as well as traditional methods such as PCA and autoencoders. It achieves the highest cluster concordance and batch-mixing scores, effectively removing donor/assay batch effects while preserving cell-type structure. Cross-species evaluation shows superior alignment of homologous cell types and >90% zero-shot annotation accuracy for major kidney lineages in both human and mouse. Even its 1B-parameter and 500M variants consistently outperform all existing models.

How p53 action shapes these stage-dependent expression landscapes is poorly understood. Using a mouse model where p53 function is restored in advanced pancreatic cancer, we demonstrate that p53 dependent gene expression is determined by regulation of YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcriptional complexes at multiple levels of molecular control. Restoration of p53 activity in pancreatic cancer cells expands transcriptional regulation by reorganizing TEAD binding at newly accessible enhancer landscapes, resulting in distinct TEAD-driven gene regulatory networks when p53 is inactivated versus engaged. Furthermore, p53 potentiates expression of newly licensed TEAD targets by increasing TAZ levels in response to the actin remodeling associated with cell cycle arrest and senescence. Thus, p53 activity controls the qualitative and quantitative output of YAP/TAZ-TEAD, including secretory programs involved in tumor-immune communication and remodeling of the microenvironment.

Among conserved early-upregulated genes, two classes emerged: Class I is preferentially induced by M. stadtmanae, whereas Class II is similarly induced by both species. To investigate the origin of the Class I/II phenotype, we measured uptake and applied TLR8 inhibition, finding greater early uptake with M. stadtmanae and broad TLR8 dependence across readouts.

Dose-response analyses with RNA inputs established distinct activation thresholds, with Class II at low dose (via STAT1/2) and Class I only at higher dose (via p65).

Here we present scLinguist, a foundation model for cross-modality translation introduces a three-stage framework: self-supervised pretraining on large-scale unimodal datasets to learn modality-specific representations, post-pretraining on limited paired data to capture cross-modality relationships, and inference to predict missing modalities (e.g., protein from RNA) in fine-tuning or zero-shot settings. Systematic benchmarking shows that scLinguist consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting protein abundance from RNA across diverse biological contexts. It achieves high predictive performance while preserving cellular heterogeneity and further enables mechanistic and generalizable inference under simulated gene perturbations. Furthermore, scLinguist exhibits strong transferability across health states and datasets. By leveraging abundant unimodal data and minimizing dependence on paired assays, scLinguist establishes a scalable and versatile framework for cross-modality translation in single-cell analysis.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

K.; Atkinson, C.", "abstract": "Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a leading cause of early mortality after lung transplantation and is driven by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which destabilizes the pulmonary endothelium. Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9), a vascular quiescence factor of the TGF superfamily, maintains endothelial homeostasis through ALK-1/BMPR2-mediated signaling. Herein, this work identified a previously unrecognized suppression of BMP9 signaling during early reperfusion in a murine orthotopic lung transplant model. Allograft transcriptomic profiling revealed rapid downregulation of BMP9 pathway components, including Bmpr2, Acvrl1, Smad5, and Eng. Recombinant BMP9 administered at reperfusion enhanced Id1 expression in pulmonary endothelium, reduced neutrophil infiltration, preserved vascular barrier function, and improved oxygenation. In vitro, BMP9 attenuated proinflammatory cytokine release following simulated cold ischemia-reperfusion injury in human lung endothelial cells. Plasma from lung transplant recipients, regardless of PGD status, had impaired BMP9-induced ID1 expression in endothelial cells, with the most profound suppression observed in patients with interstitial lung disease. These findings implicate transient loss of BMP9 signaling as a key feature of transplant-induced vascular injury and support the therapeutic potential of BMP9 supplementation to restore endothelial homeostasis and improve early graft outcomes.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

More status changes were reported for plants (2,902), mainly due to updated methodology leading to a lower risk status. Analysing the accompanying explanation for each status change revealed that most changes were non-genuine (e.g., new information, taxonomy, or methodology) rather than genuine (e.g., true changes in population size, range, or threats). Genuine improvements in the status of species in B.C. have been exceedingly rare.

Despite their prevalence, understanding EhCoV antigenic and immune signatures remains elusive. SARS-CoV-2 has evolved as the fifth EhCoV, requiring seasonal vaccination in most parts of the world, and currently, no other EhCoV vaccines are available. SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with EhCoVs increases disease severity; thus, combined vaccination may provide increased protection against seasonal EhCoVs overall. Here, we explored Spike (S) receptor binding domain (RBD) vs. N-terminal domain (NTD) B-cell immunodominance in EhCoV-positive convalescent donors and immunogenicity in mice. We found that while antibody and B-cell isotypes were relatively dominant to S NTD, mice immunized with S RBD elicited significantly higher binding and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses. With that knowledge, we used computational methods to infer that EhCoV S sequences evolve into two main clades and designed chimeric immunodominant domains (IDDs) from both clades for each EhCoV. IDDs were scaffolded onto two-component nanoparticles (NPs) displaying each IDD separately (monovalent IDD NP); three beta-EhCoV IDDs (Mosaic-3 IDD NP); or five EhCoVs IDDs (Mosaic-5 IDD NP). Mice immunized with mosaic IDD NPs, but not soluble IDD antigens nor monovalent IDD NPs, elicited potent, broadly cross-reactive binding and neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, other EhCoVs, and Sarbecoviruses. System serology revealed that all four IDD immunogens elicited distinct Ab subclasses and Fc-effector functions, with mosaic-5 IDD NPs eliciting the most de novo Ab subclasses, distributions, and broader Fc-mediated immune mechanisms. Dissection of vaccine-immune sera revealed polyclonal Ab responses against multiple non-overlapping cross-reactive S epitopes. Due to elicitation of broad Ab responses with combinatory functionality, IDD NPs open new horizons for developing first-in-class supraseasonal EhCoV vaccine candidates, with potential to decrease frequent SARS-CoV-2 sequence updates and protect against other EhCoVs. Moreover, elicitation of Ab breadth that spans pandemic-threat Sarbecoviruses gives mosaic IDD NPs promise towards pandemic preparedness.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

All cultivated banana varieties are susceptible, with the wild progenitor Musa balbisiana being the only known source of complete resistance.

Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed a five-fold upregulation of MusaVicilin gene in M. balbisiana (BB genome) compared to the BXW- susceptible  Pisang Awak when challenged with the pathogen, suggesting its role in defense. This study investigated whether constitutive overexpression of the MusaVicilin gene cloned from M. balbisiana could enhance resistance to BXW in the susceptible  Sukali Ndiizi cultivar (AAB genome). Transgenic events were developed with the MusaVicilin gene under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. These events exhibited enhanced disease resistance compared with non-transgenic control plants. The overexpression of MusaVicilin highlights its potential as a candidate gene for engineering resistance to BXW in susceptible cultivars.

Epidemiological and animal studies suggest that maternal psychosocial stress may worsen the effects of air pollutants on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Previous work utilizing a mouse model of combined prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) and maternal stress (MS) has found numerous sex-specific effects of DEP/MS exposure on neuroimmune outcomes, dopamine receptors, the gut-brain axis, and social behavior. However, it is unclear how broadly the immune landscape is shifted in the brain and intestinal epithelium following DEP/MS. Here, we analyzed immune gene expression in 5 brain regions important for social behavior and in 3 regions of the intestinal epithelium in both male and female offspring following either DEP/MS or control exposure. We found several interesting overall patterns. First, changes in expression of immune genes such as CD11b and Tlr4 were concentrated in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. Tlr4 and Il-17ra mRNA also increased in the jejunum and colon following DEP/MS, but only in females. Second, in the nucleus accumbens, catecholamine-O-methyltransferase (Comt) and dopamine transporter 1 (Slc6a3) gene expression were increased following DEP/MS indicating increased dopamine degradation at and reuptake from the synapse, respectively. Additionally, Drd2 mRNA was decreased following DEP/MS in males. Finally, we observed numerous sex differences in immune gene expression regardless of treatment in both the brain and gut. Together, these findings suggest the nucleus accumbens is a key site for neuroimmune and dopaminergic changes following DEP/MS exposure and indicate persistent female-specific changes in intestinal immunity following these prenatal exposures.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

In this manuscript, to mimic the typical human vaccine recipient using a mouse model, we evaluated the impact of previous influenza infection on the adaptive immune response elicited by the recombinant influenza vaccine Flublok, co-delivered with either AddaVax, an MF59 mimetic, or a nanolipoparticle innate activator R-DOTAP. In the context of influenza B infection memory, a re-polarization of the responding CD4 T cells and dramatic change in the fate of the vaccine-elicited CD4 T cells was discovered. A rapidly evolving CD4 T cell response enriched in TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma was observed, with the HA-B-specific CD4 T cells also displaying increased expression of chemokine receptors associated with lung homing potential and ultimate accumulation in the lung tissue. Unexpectedly, similar shifts in the features of the H3-specific CD4 T cell and antibody response were also observed, drawn from the naive repertoire. These results are consistent with the view the microenvironment of the vaccine draining lymph node, developed in the context of immune memory, rather than infection-induced CD4 T cell imprinting, plays the decisive role in the functional phenotype, magnitude, and fate of vaccine-elicited CD4 T cells. These results have important implications for both pre-clinical models of vaccination and future vaccine strategies.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

A.; Lopez-Castejon, G.; Brough, D.", "abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-1 is a pro-inflammatory member of the IL-1 cytokine superfamily and is important for inflammatory responses to infection and injury. Unlike pro-IL-1 {beta}, pro-IL-1 is mainly localised to the nucleus upon expression. This is mediated by a nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) responsible for its importin-dependent transport into the nucleus. This nuclear localisation and the presence of histone acetyl transferase (HAT)-binding domains within the pro-domain suggest a role of this cytokine in gene transcription regulation. In addition, nuclear trafficking of pro-IL-1 is proposed to regulate its secretion. To-date, studies on the nuclear role of pro-IL-1 have used overexpression systems. Here, we generated a mouse where the endogenous Il1a gene was edited with CRISPR to disrupt the NLS (mNLS). Using an in vitro approach with murine macrophages we found that this NLS mutation did not affect pro-IL-1 RNA expression levels in response to LPS but increased its protein expression levels. Moreover, we found that the transcriptional signature induced by LPS was not altered between WT and mNLS macrophages. Release of IL-1 in response to different stimuli such as ionomycin was not negatively impacted by disrupted nuclear localisation, although higher levels of IL-1 release were detected, potentially due to increased levels of pro-IL-1. Inflammatory responses in an in vivo model of peritonitis and an influenza infection model were comparable between WT and mNLS mice. Thus, we have established a mouse model in which pro-IL-1 nuclear localisation is disrupted, although future research is required to reveal the importance of this nuclear localisation for IL-1 function.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Difficulty treating and eradicating NTM-PD highlights the need for improved understanding of bacterial mechanisms to establish chronic infections. People with the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis (CF) develop bronchiectasis and are the population at highest risk of NTM-PD, caused mainly by Mycobacterium avium or Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabsc). The majority of people with CF (pwCF) and bronchiectasis develop chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infections. We hypothesized that antibiotics used to treat P. aeruginosa infections could enhance Mabsc persistence in the CF airway. Here we demonstrate that clinically relevant concentrations of tobramycin, which does not kill Mabsc but is frequently administered to pwCF with chronic P. aeruginosa infections, induced Mabsc expression of whiB7, a transcription factor that activates genes associated with resistance to host defenses. Tobramycin promoted Mabsc resistance to killing by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and survival in both human macrophages and mice. Deletion of whiB7 increased Mabsc susceptibility to killing by H2O2, decreased ability of Mabsc to persist in macrophages, and disrupted ability of tobramycin to enhance Mabsc survival. Transcriptomic data defining the tobramycin associated WhiB7 regulon revealed differential gene expression of factors that could enhance Mabsc resistance to stress conditions such as those in found in the CF lung.

Based on metagenomic comparisons of 25 hypersaline sites across 11 countries, we explored the influence of environmental factors, ionic composition, and geographic distance on their microbial community structures and taxa diversification. Our results revealed that microbial communities from coastal environments were taxonomically and functionally more similar to each other than to those from inland sites. A distance-decay relationship in the genetic relatedness, significantly more pronounced for the coastal sites, was observed among reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), clearer at distances below 400 km, but still detectable across global scales up to 20,000 km. The 484 MAGs recovered, representing 284 distinct species, revealed a striking global ubiquity, with 62.5% of the species showed cosmopolitanism as were detected across multiple sites. The higher taxonomic and genetic similarity of coastal environments over the inland sites seems to reflect an environmental connection that may be related to the ocean current dynamics. Most cosmopolitan species showed clear allopatric differentiation, although few cases of a single globally dominant genomovar (average nucleotide identity, ANI > 99.8%) were also observed, especially for some Haloquadratum species. The findings suggest that coastal hypersaline systems are loosely constrained by geographic isolation, with clear signals of allopatric speciation at the mesoscale (tenths to hundreds of kilometers) that become blurrier at larger scales.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

A meta-analysis of 251 AMD-associated metagenomes showed that these potentially thermophilic lineages are globally distributed but typically rare, with local peaks (~6.6%) at sites such as Fankou. Metabolic reconstruction suggested a facultatively anaerobic, mixotrophic lifestyle capable of CO oxidation and sulfur reduction, and extensive acid- and heavy-metal resistance mediated primarily by ether-linked archaeal lipids, ion efflux systems, and enzymatic reduction.

MLST, plasmid replicon analysis, and resistance gene identification were conducted using bioinformatics. Phage isolation, electron microscopy-based morphological and biofilm analysis, and evaluation of lytic activity, stability, and host range were performed. Phage genome sequencing and annotation identified functional genes. Results: The host strain Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP6697) was multidrug-resistant, exhibiting resistance to 18 of 22 tested antibiotics, and genome analysis identified ST16 with eight plasmid replicons and 23 resistance genes, including blaCTX-M-15, blaNDM-5, and blaOXA-181.

Charles River mice developed significantly less severe disease. Co-housing led to partial homogenization of the gut microbiota, driven by asymmetric transfer of taxa from Charles River to in-house mice, which corresponded with reduced disease severity in the latter. The skin microbiota, however, showed limited exchange. Disease severity was inversely associated with gut microbial alpha diversity, with protective taxa such as Lactobacillus intestinalis and Parabacteroides distasonis enriched in Charles River mice, while pro-inflammatory taxa including Turicimonas muris and Muribaculum intestinale were enriched in in-house mice. A machine learning model further identified a gut taxon most closely matching the candidate genus Scatocola as a strong negative predictor of disease severity.

The legume symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti (Sm) releases volatile methylketones (MKs), one of which acts as an infochemical in bacteria and hampers plant-bacteria interactions. MK production in Sm is modestly increased in the absence of the long-chain-fatty-acyl-coenzyme-A (CoA) synthetase FadD. To explore further the ecological role of MKs on soil and plant bacterial communities, we aimed at obtaining an MK-overproducer Sm strain by deleting the 3-oxo-acyl-CoA-thiolase-encoding fadA gene. Analyses of the Sm wild type (wt), and fad mutant volatilomes identified seventeen compounds consisting mostly of MKs and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and revealed that the fadA mutant produced more MKs than the fadD mutant and much more than the wt, while in the fadD mutant FAME emission was increased. When natural soil or the rhizosphere of Medicago truncatula were exposed to wt and fadA volatilomes or synthetic MKs, bacterial alpha- or beta-diversity were not strongly affected but specific genera were identified which responded differentially to each condition. Interestingly, Sm volatilomes had a significant effect on root endosphere Ensifer/Sinorhizobium populations by maintaining their abundance over time in contrast to control conditions or exposure to synthetic MKs.

The study aimed to examine the effects of an inhibitor targeting bacterial glutaminyl cyclase (which is selectively present in Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), and Prevotella intermedia (Pi)) on various multispecies biofilms. Two multi-species biofilms - one containing four species (including Tf) and another with 12 species (including Tf, Pg, and Pi) - were cultured in the presence of 31.25 - 500 M of a [4,5-c]pyridine-based inhibitor. After 24 hours, bacterial counts, biofilm mass, metabolic activity, and, when Pg was included, Arg-gingipain activity were measured. Additionally, the biofilms were exposed to monocytic cells; here, the release of interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and IL-10 was analyzed. The data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc comparison performed using the Bonferroni correction. In all biofilms, total bacterial counts and those of Pg and Tf remained unaffected by the inhibitor. In the 12-species biofilm, both mass and total metabolic activity decreased at high inhibitor concentrations (500 M to 75.2{+/-}6.5% and 87.2{+/-}5.8%, respectively; each p <0.001). The arginine-specific amidolytic activities of Rgp declined dose-dependently, down to 60.4{+/-}10.2% (p <0.001) at 500 M of the inhibitor.

S.; Alumasa, J. N.", "abstract": "Enzyme-mediated resistance is among the main strategies bacteria use to evade antibiotic action. S-adenosylmethionine-dependent erythromycin resistance methyltransferases catalyze the methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA in bacteria, causing resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin type-B antibiotics. Given the diversity and number of identified variants of these enzymes, it is vital to devise ways of inhibiting their activity to rescue affected antibiotics. Here, we use computer-aided solvent mapping and virtual screening techniques to identify inhibitors of Erms displaying promising adjuvant properties. We further demonstrate that an E. coli model expressing a recombinant S. aureus ErmC (SaErmC) variant causes substantial resistance to representative macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics. Assessment of test compounds using this resistance model revealed candidates displaying promising adjuvant activity when combined with erythromycin or clindamycin. Antibiotic combinations with a principal candidate oxadiazole, JNAL-016, completely blocked SaErmC-mediated resistance against erythromycin, resulting in an antibiotic-sensitive phenotype in broth microdilution screening assays. This compound also suppressed ErmC activity, allowing erythromycin to regain its bactericidal properties when assessed in actively growing cultures using time-kill assays. JNAL-016 displayed a noncompetitive mode of inhibition against SaErmC activity in vitro and bound the purified enzyme with high affinity (Kd = 1.8 {+/-} 0.7 M) based on microscale thermophoresis data. Competition experiments suggested that JNAL-016 competes with SAM for its binding pocket on the enzyme, and this compound exhibited no toxicity against human embryonic kidney cells. These findings establish a practical strategy for targeting Erm-mediated resistance, which could lead to a viable adjuvant-based therapy against bacterial pathogens that weaponize variants of this class of methyltransferases.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

T.; Sutani, T.; Bando, M.; Shirahige, K.", "abstract": "Cohesin organizes 3D chromatin architecture, including promoter-enhancer loops, yet its loss causes surprisingly modest changes in steady-state gene expression. We resolve this paradox by demonstrating that cohesin performs two opposing but balancing functions through genome-wide analyses and in vitro transcription complex reconstitution. First, it promotes transcription initiation by facilitating enhancer-promoter communication that maintains active promoter chromatin. Second, it acts as a transient gate that delays pause release by briefly associating with the transcriptional machinery during the pause-release transition. This gating occurs downstream of CDK9 and is relieved by cohesin's ATPase-dependent turnover. Kinetic modelling shows that minimal changes in steady-state gene expression result from the counterbalance between reduced initiation and enhanced pause release. In contrast, cohesin depletion impairs robust transcriptional induction in response to external stimuli. Moreover, the cohesin-mediated delay in pause release serves as a quality-control-like step by promoting elongation complex assembly and transcription processivity. These insights have important implications for cohesin-related diseases, including cancers and cohesinopathies, and broader principles of transcriptional regulation.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

While ANGPTL3 inhibition lowers circulating triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), its impact on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains uncertain. This study investigates the roles of ANGPTL3 and EL in the trans-endothelial transport of LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), an early step in atherogenesis. Using primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC), we demonstrate that EL promotes binding, uptake, and transcytosis of LDL and HDL, with its catalytic activity being essential for transport but not for surface association. ANGPTL3 selectively reduced the transport of LDL but not HDL through HAEC. Mechanistically, EL and scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) act sequentially to mediate LDL uptake, but independently of each other towards HDL uptake. Ex vivo, ANGPTL3 reduced LDL accumulation within bovine aorta. Interestingly, ANGPTL4 had no measurable effect on lipoprotein transport, while ANGPTL8 modestly inhibited both LDL and HDL association with endothelial cells. Our findings provide evidence that ANGPTL3 inhibits EL-mediated transendothelial LDL transport. Opposing effects of ANGPTL3 inhibition on LDL-C concentration and LDL entry into the arterial wall may explain why recent population studies did not reveal any genetically causal association of ANGPTL3 and LIPG with ASCVD risk.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

However, the functional properties of most protein isoforms are unknown, and it remains unclear whether most have distinct or redundant functions. The development of methods to address this question and characterise proteins at scale are needed. We hypothesized that high-content imaging combined with classifier-based analysis could provide a powerful and broadly applicable approach for characterizing subcellular localization and behavioural differences between protein isoforms. As a proof-of-concept, we examine 42 isoform pairs in HeLa cells, each pair consisting of two isoforms from the same gene that differ in the inclusion/exclusion of a tissue-regulated cassette exon, many differing by 10 or fewer amino acids. We identify localisation differences for ~38% (16/42) of isoform pairs, and features describing these differences. We perform follow-up examination of two sorting nexin 2 (SNX2) isoforms that differ by four amino acids inserted into an -helix, which drastically altered subcellular localisation. We find the localisation differences are caused by the presence of additional residues rather than their composition, which reduces vesicle association while enhancing interactions with the insulin receptor. Lastly, we generalise these findings by showing that microexons frequently overlap -helices, are enriched in helix-stabilizing residues, have lengths that preserve helical register, and often modulate surface charge. Together, our findings support a broad role for alternative splicing in modulating protein subcellular localization and increasing functional proteomic diversity.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

However, the nucleocytoplasmic localisation and the modulation of the alternative splicing of the 20 exons of BIN1 in OLs. are poorly understood. We characterised BIN1 isoforms expression in OLs from two independent cohorts of postmortem AD brains using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry and extended the findings to experimental APP/PS1 mice and primary OL cultures. Neuronal isoforms of BIN1 (BIN1:H, 95kDa) were significantly reduced (P < 0.0001), and the white matter/OL-specific isoforms (BIN1:L, 70kDa) were increased (P = 0.0349) in AD cases and APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, the OL-specific BIN1 isoforms, identified by three different antibodies, were found in the nucleus of OL in human and mouse. Nuclear BIN1 was expressed by both the OL progenitor cell (OPC) and mature OL in vitro.

The putative interacting sites between OL-specific BIN1:L and c-Myc was also identified by in silico analysis.

Understanding the impacts of different epidemiological traits on the spread of ASFv is important for developing effective surveillance systems and control strategies. We developed a spatial epidemiological model of ASFv transmission in wild pigs, which contributes to ASFv persistence in countries where wild pig populations are widespread. We evaluated the impacts of a realistic set of epidemiological traits including incubation period, infectious period, disease-induced mortality rate, and length of immunity on spatial transmission dynamics under different ecological conditions for the host population (i.e. host density). We analyze effects of these conditions on outbreak metrics using boosted regression models with response variables: peak incidence, rate of spatial spread, seroprevalence and area invaded after one year, and probability that an outbreak will occur. We found that the infectious period of living individuals is the most important predictor at all pig densities for peak incidence and the area affected at one year, followed closely by the incubation period of the virus.

As such, they facilitate the reproduction, growth, and migration of many fish species, and are particularly tied to the life histories of many forage fishes. Temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have rapidly increased in recent decades, which may be driving changes in nearshore ecosystems. Here, we use 11 years of summer beach seine survey data within Casco Bay, Maine, to illustrate temperature-related changes to community structure. Further, we use Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) as focal species to describe the effects of temperature on individual growth rates and relative abundance. The progression of seasonal use patterns and relative abundance in the nearshore with seasonal warming is evident; species that have cooler preferred temperatures are caught less frequently in the nearshore regions in late summer, when temperatures are highest. Increased temperatures were associated with significantly higher silverside growth rates and community compositions dominated by silverside. Temperature alone did not explain interannual variation in herring growth rates or predict herring-dominated nearshore community composition, and there is evidence that density-dependence may be more important to herring population dynamics. Monitoring nearshore ecosystems could provide critical insight into the dynamics of species that use these areas to facilitate reproduction, growth, and migration, and could therefore be used to identify potential changes to Gulf of Maine community and trophic ecology.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

One currently understudied class of functional molecules is long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Studying the full lncRNA landscape in IBD is challenging due in part to an incomplete lncRNA annotation and a lack of their functional characterization in tissues of interest. We used a genome-guided alignment strategy to assemble predicted lncRNA transcripts using short RNA-sequencing data from colon tissue of adult patient samples. When combining our predicted lncRNAs with previous lncRNA annotations, we determined 98 that were differentially expressed, recapitulating many from previous IBD studies while also uncovering new ones. We built gene co-expression networks to cluster lncRNAs with functionally characterized protein-coding genes. Clusters containing differential lncRNAs were correlated to disease status and associated with pathways related to the humoral immune response, metabolism, and tissue regeneration. We uncovered multiple differential lncRNAs whose expression significantly correlated with nearby differential protein-coding genes that have also been differentially expressed in other IBD datasets, such as PITX2. We focused on a predicted lncRNA that is antisense to the PITX2-adjacent lncRNA PANCR, which we called PANCR-AS1, and provide multiple lines of evidence that support PANCR-AS1 functioning as an enhancer of PITX2 expression.

The quality of quantitative surfaceomics data depends heavily on the effectiveness of the cell surface enrichment used during sample preparation. Enrichment improves sensitivity for low abundance PM proteins and ensures that the changes detected reflect PM expression changes rather than whole cell changes. Cell surface biotinylation with PM-impermeable, amine-reactive reagents is a facile, accessible, and unbiased approach to enrich PM proteins. For unclear reasons however, it results in unexpectedly high contamination with intracellular proteins, reducing its utility. We report that biotinylating human cells with amine-reactive reagents intracellularly labels a small but reproducible population of non-viable cells. Although these dead cells represent only 5+2% of the total, we find that in T cell preparations the dead cells account for 90% of labelled proteins. Depleting Annexin V positive dead T cells post-labelling removes ~99% of the intracellularly labelled cells, resulting in markedly improved PM identifications, peptide counts, and iBAQ intensities. Correspondingly, we found substantial depletion of intracellular proteins, particular of nuclear origin. Overall, the cumulative intensity of PM proteins increased from 4% to 55.8% with dead cell depletion. Finally, we demonstrate that immature ER/Golgi glycoforms of CD11a and CD18 are selectively removed by dead-cell depletion. We conclude that high intracellular labelling of non-viable cells is the major source of intracellular protein contaminants in amine-reactive surface enrichment methods and can be reduced by dead-cell depletion post-labelling, improving both sensitivity and accuracy of plasma membrane proteomics.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Bpa recruits substrates as a dodecamer and triggers the gate opening of the proteasome 20S core particle; however, the structural basis for its oligomerization and substrate recognition remains unclear. Here, we define the temperature-sensitive oligomerization mechanism of Bpa and elucidate its interaction with a non-native substrate. Using size-exclusion chromatography, charge detection mass spectrometry, and pulsed hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we show that Bpa reversibly assembles into a dodecameric ring from dimeric and tetrameric species in a temperature-dependent manner. We used HDX-MS to map the oligomerization interfaces during Bpa assembly. Methyl transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-based NMR experiments and site-specific truncations further validate the existence of discrete tetrameric and dodecameric states. To overcome the limitations posed by the poor solubility of the native substrates of Bpa, we establish the DNA-binding domain of hTRF1 as a surrogate substrate. Bpa binds hTRF1 and mediates its degradation in a 20S CP-dependent manner. We quantify the affinity and stoichiometry of the Bpa-hTRF1 interaction using methyl-TROSY NMR, identifying a 12 Bpa subunit : 3 hTRF1 binding ratio with micromolar affinity that is modulated by salt concentration. Our NMR-based mapping experiments pinpoint the interaction surfaces on both Bpa and hTRF1, revealing key hydrophobic residues that mediate substrate engagement.

Cryo-EM structures of Na- and choline-bound sfCHT reveal a 14 transmembrane helix topology with a LeuT-fold architecture and Na coordination geometry similar to CHT1. Captured in an inward-facing conformation, in sfCHT choline is found at a site near the cytoplasmic side. Computational analysis and transport assays reveal local conformational changes along a choline translocation pathway to the cytosolic site. Transport assays with CHT1 variants, carrying substitutions at conserved residues along the proposed translocation pathway in sfCHT, reveal a conserved mechanism of choline transport between the bacterial and human choline transporters.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

In Escherichia coli, thousands of chemoreceptor molecules with diverse sensory properties cooperatively modulate the kinase activity of these arrays and, via phosphotransfer to a diffusible response regulator, control the cell's swimming behavior. Various methods have been used to study these sensory arrays in live cells, from population-level assays to single-cell measurements, revealing hierarchical coupling interactions that underlie their remarkable sensory properties. However, measuring the responses of individual arrays has remained a challenge. Here, by combining the kinase and response regulator into a functional hybrid protein that resides within the array, we directly measured the kinase responses of individual arrays in live cells. These measurements revealed highly diverse and growth-phase-dependent sensory properties of individual arrays. Even arrays within the same cell were not substantially correlated. We also observed dynamic shifts in receptor occupancy within individual arrays. Overall, these data suggest that each array contains a 'frozen' non-uniformity, reflecting its unique assembly history and resulting in a mosaic arrangement of cooperative signaling regions, each with distinct receptor content. Consistent with this view, measured dose-responses of individual arrays mostly exhibit low cooperativity. Interestingly, signal integration in such non-uniform arrays is expected to inherently vary with the size of the cooperative regions.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we assessed monoclonal antibody variants of L9 for protection against chimeric transgenic Plasmodium CSP parasite strains that had altered the number and spacing of minor repeats within PfCSP. We used site-saturation mutagenesis and DNA shuffling to generate libraries for yeast display-affinity screening. Sequencing of enriched yeast display libraries identified a panel of L9 variants with improved affinity to Peptide 22, the canonical motif containing the sequential minor and major repeats, with maintained binding to PfCSP. In vivo challenge showed that the affinity-improved variant L9_yd19 was modestly more potent than L9 against a chimeric transgenic parasite similar to the PfCSP sequence of an East African Pf strain with two widely spaced minor repeats, and comparable potency to L9 against the benchmark 3D7 strain. L9_yd19 also had high affinity against NANP major repeats and was highly protective against transgenic Plasmodium CSP containing only NANP major repeats (NANP12). Cryo-EM analyses revealed L9_yd19 recognition of PfCSP to comprise two distinct homotypic interfaces: a side-to-side interface with an asymmetric antibody trimer, and a head-to-head interface between the two antibody trimers. These combined to yield a higher-order complex consisting of two trimeric layers of antibodies related by 2-fold symmetry; one layer recognizing the minor repeat epitope (if available) and the second recognizing major repeats.

While the implication of Fc gamma RIIa and Fc gamma RIIIb have extensively been studied in that context, that of Fc gamma RI remains elusive. Recently, aggregated IgGs have been shown to induce rapid Fc gamma RI upregulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, but the biological relevance of this process is still unclear. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from healthy volunteers and patients with lupus. Aggregated IgGs were prepared as a model of immune complex. Fc gamma receptor surface expression on circulating leukocytes and on freshly isolated neutrophils was measured by flow cytometry. ROS production was monitored with luminol-based chemiluminescence. Results: Incubation of blood samples from healthy volunteers with aggregated IgGs rapidly upregulated the surface expression of Fc gamma RI, predominantly on neutrophils. Stimulation of isolated neutrophils from healthy donors with aggregated IgGs resulted in the production of ROS in an Fc gamma RI-dependent fashion. Cytochalasin B potentiated Fc gamma RI expression and ROS production. Positive correlations between neutrophil Fc gamma RI and ROS production were observed in resting blood from both healthy volunteers and lupus patients. In the lupus cohort, monocyte Fc gamma RI also correlated with ROS production. Conclusion: This study unveils a previously underappreciated role for neutrophil Fc gamma RI in ROS production in both healthy individuals and patients with lupus, and identifies Fc gamma RI as a potential biomarker of oxidative response.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

In this project, we used the MOFA and Stabl algorithms to analyze FluPRINT, estimate the population structure from the data, and identify the most important features for predicting response to the vaccine. The preprocessing of the dataset included removing repeat features, scaling by assay, and removing outliers. Since Stabl does not directly address missing values, features with high amounts of missing values were removed and the remaining were ignored. MOFA identified the top feature in structure extraction as IL neg 2 CD4 pos CD45RA neg pSTAT5. MOFA explains well the variance of the data while also choosing features that have good significance, as illustrated by their significant p-values (p < 0.05).

In this study, human tonsil cells were cultured with and without tonsil-derived fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) either in 2D or within a 3D PEG-4MAL hydrogel culture. Antigen-specific B cell responses in co-cultures were studied by comparing unstimulated cultures to stimulation with antigen (SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) or Influenza hemagglutinin (HA), both with or without adjuvant R848), S-nanoparticles and influenza vaccines. Combination of FRCs with the 3D matrix significantly improved B and T cell survival and facilitated reaggregation into follicle-like structures. Antigen-specific responses were most pronounced in 3D FRC-supported co-cultures, with increasing S- or HA-specific B cell frequencies, antibody-secreting cell differentiation, and secretion of antigen-specific antibodies. Importantly, cell death and unspecific bystander activation was lowest in 3D FRC-supported cultures. Additionally, GC-associated chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR5 showed distinct expression patterns on CD27+ CD38+ B cells, reflecting GC-like dark and light zone organization typically observed in SLOs in vivo. Autologous and allogeneic FRC-supported cultures yielded comparable results, demonstrating the platforms potential for high-throughput applications.

Over time, it has drawn considerable attention for its potential to promote plant growth. However, its biotechnological application is complicated by high genomic plasticity, which underlies both its beneficial traits and its ability to cause disease in a wide range of plants, as well as occasional opportunistic infections in humans, raising biosafety concerns. In this study, we conducted a comparative genomic analysis of all publicly available Pantoea genomes. Our goals were to refine taxonomic classifications and to identify genes linked to biotechnological potential, virulence, and antibiotic resistance, thereby clarifying lifestyle strategies within the genus. We found that plant growth-promoting genes are widely conserved, particularly those involved in phosphate solubilization, phytohormone biosynthesis, and siderophore production. In contrast, traits such as nitrogen fixation and ACC deaminase activity were restricted to specific species. The resistome analysis revealed intrinsic resistance mechanisms conserved across the genus, primarily involving diverse efflux pump families and {beta}-lactamases conferring resistance to cephalosporins. In parallel, the pan-GWAS highlighted lifestyle-defining genetic markers, including the hrp/hrc genes encoding type III secretion system components, pepM (phosphoenolpyruvate mutase) associated with the production of a phytotoxin, and ibeB, an invasin linked to clinical infections.

E.; Moran, G.; Al-hebshi, N.", "abstract": "Introduction: Mounting evidence links F. nucleatum, particularly subsp. polymorphum (now classified as F. polymorphum) to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). However, not all studies support this association, and its ubiquitous presence in health complicates its role as a driver of disease, raising a fundamental question: Can some isolates be pathogenic 'high risk' while others are not? Here, we investigated the carcinogenic potential of clinical isolates of F. polymorphum from oral dysplastic lesions. Methods: Sixteen, fully sequenced F. polymorphum isolates from healthy subjects (6 isolates) or patients with mild epithelial dysplasia (3 isolates), moderate dysplasia (3 isolates) or severe dysplasia/OSCC (4 isolates) were included. The isolates were assessed for their effect on the proliferation, migration, invasion, transcriptome and cytokinome of dysplastic oral keratinocytes (DOK). The isolates were also subject to RNA-seq and secreted amyloid FadA analyses. Results: Although genetically indistinguishable, the isolates differed markedly in their effects on dysplastic oral keratinocytes (DOK) with isolates from dysplastic lesions demonstrating enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of DOK in proportion to the dysplasia severity of their clinical origin. Strikingly, amyloid-like FadA levels were also significantly higher in dysplasia-associated 'high-risk' isolates and correlated with their pro-carcinogenic effects. RNA-seq further showed upregulation of heme acquisition genes in high risk isolates. Transcriptome and cytokine profiling of DOK revealed a uniform pro-inflammatory response across all isolates, independent of origin, but genes and pathways related to proliferation correlated with dysplasia severity. Supporting this, 45% of the most severity-correlated host genes identified in vitro were also differentially expressed in the same direction in tumors versus normal tissues in the TCGA OSCC dataset. Conclusion: These results show, for the first time, that clinical oral isolates of F. polymorphum vary in their carcinogenic properties, establishing the novel concept of 'high-risk' versus 'low-risk, isolates in oral carcinogenesis, potentially driven by genome-independent regulation.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}
{"title": "JUNO-Coated Beads as a Functional Assay to Capture and Characterize Fertilization-Competent Human Sperm", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.30.679507", "authors": "Cots-Rodriguez, P.; Sanchez-Tudela, M.; Hamze, J. G.; Yip, P.; Gomez Sanchez, E.; Lee, J. E.; Jimenez-Movilla, M.", "abstract": "Study question: Can human fertilization-competent spermatozoa be captured through their ability to bind the oocyte receptor JUNO? Summary answer: JUNO-coated beads, which mimic the oocyte geometry, selectively bound acrosome-reacted spermatozoa with intact DNA, revealing that vitrification preserves functional sperm binding while slow cryopreservation increases non-specific interactions. What is known already: It is well established that sperm must undergo the acrosome reaction and expose the receptor IZUMO1 on the sperm head to bind specifically to JUNO on the oolemma. Studying the spermatozoa that reaches and engages with the oolemma, however, remains highly challenging due to the technical difficulty of recovering these sperm at the site of molecular interaction. Bead-based models that content oocyte receptors have therefore emerged as a powerful approach to functionally assess sperm-oocyte interactions, with promising applications for evaluating sperm quality. Study design, size, duration: This was a cross-sectional experimental study including 21 semen donors of reproductive age recruited between January 2023 and June 2025. The JUNO-bead-based model was first validated using fresh human semen samples to establish optimal sperm concentration and co-incubation time. Subsequently, two semen preservation methods, slow freezing and rapid freezing, were compared with respect to sperm binding capacity to JUNO-coated beads, acrosomal status, and DNA integrity. Finally, donors were classified according to sperm binding capacity. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Recombinant JUNO protein was expressed and purified in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells, and protein-bead conjugation was verified by immunochemistry. Human semen samples were obtained from donors aged 19-42 years, including both fresh ejaculates and cryopreserved samples. Sperm binding capacity, acrosome reaction, and DNA fragmentation were assessed using widefield fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Specificity of sperm-bead binding was evaluated with anti-IZUMO1 monoclonal antibodies. Main results and the role of chance: Human JUNO recombinant protein was successfully conjugated to oocyte-sized beads to generate a sperm-binding assay mimicking the geometry of the oocyte and experimental conditions of the in vitro fertilization. Human sperm bound specifically to JUNO-beads in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with highly significant differences compared to control beads (p [&le;] 0.0001). Vitrified-based cryopreserved sperm displayed higher binding to JUNO-beads than conventionally cryopreserved samples (p [&le;] 0.0001). Binding was significantly inhibited by an anti-IZUMO1 (2.5 ug/mL) antibody that blocks specifically the IZUMO1-JUNO interaction in vitrified samples (p [&le;] 0.01), but not in conventionally cryopreserved sperm. Sperm bound to JUNO-beads were predominantly acrosome-reacted in both preservation methods; however, vitrified samples retained higher DNA integrity compared with conventionally cryopreserved samples. The assay proved robust across multiple donors and ejaculates, allowing classification into low- and high-binding capacity (LBC and HBC) groups. Pearson correlation analyses revealed only weak associations between total sperm motility and bead-binding parameters (|r| < 0.27), indicating negligible or absent linear relationships. Large-scale data: N/A Limitations, reasons for caution: This study was performed in vitro, and the number of semen donors was limited. As all participants were healthy donors, the population represents a selected fertile subpopulation. Further studies using samples from diverse patient populations are required to validate the potential of the assay as a predictor of male fertility. Wider implications of the findings: This study positions the JUNO-bead binding assay as a powerful functional model to investigate the biology of fertilization-competent sperm. By selectively capturing spermatozoa that have undergone the acrosome reaction and maintain DNA integrity, the model provides a unique experimental platform to study the molecular determinants of fertilization, to refine the selection of sperm for assisted reproduction, and to identify potential targets for novel contraceptive strategies. Beyond preservation protocols, these findings provide new functional evidence that sperm preservation method directly influences the molecular integrity required for fertilization, supporting vitrification as a superior approach over slow freezing. Moreover, the JUNO-bead assay emerges as a sensitive tool to reveal differences in sperm quality that are not captured by standard semen analysis, with potential applications in the optimization of assisted reproduction and fundamental research on the mechanisms that define the fertilizing spermatozoon.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Advanced analysis projected on 2D revealed distinct adsorption mechanisms depending on the initial loci of the glycan within the protein wall. Hydrophobic surfaces facilitated stable adsorption for both RBD conformations. Conversely, hydrophilic surfaces exhibited reduced adsorption, particularly for the closed-RBD, where glycans predominantly formed hydrogen bonds.

While most methanogens grow on CO2+H2, isolates of the Genus Methanosarcina and Methanothrix can use acetate as the sole substrate for methanogenesis. Methanogenic growth on acetate, i.e., acetoclastic methanogenesis, is hypothesized to require two distinct genetic modules: one for the activation of acetate to acetyl-CoA and the other for producing a chemiosmotic gradient using electrons derived from ferredoxin. In Methanosarcina spp., the activation of acetate to acetyl-CoA is mediated by acetate kinase (Ack) and phosphotransacetylase (Pta) whereas Methanothrix spp. encode AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetases (Acs). The Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation complex (Rnf) or Energy converting hydrogenase (Ech) are critical for energy conservation in Methanosarcina spp. during growth on acetate, and a F420:phenazine oxidoreductase-like complex (Fpo') likely plays an analogous role in Methanothrix spp. Here, we tested the proposed modularity of these pathways to facilitate acetoclastic methanogenesis. First, we surveyed over a hundred genomes within the Class Methanosarcinia to show that the genomic potential for acetoclastic methanogenesis using distinct combinations of modules is widespread. We then used the genetically tractable strain, Methanosarcina acetivorans, to build all modular combinations for acetoclastic methanogenesis. Our results indicate that Acs, while functional, cannot replace Ack+Pta to rescue acetate growth in M. acetivorans. Similarly, the Fpo' bioenergetic complex cannot replace Rnf. As such, our work suggests that, in addition to horizontal gene transfer of core catabolic modules, acetoclastic metabolism in methanogens requires changes in energetic modules too.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Analyzing genomic context and domain architecture are powerful approaches for functional inference, but existing tools often lack the scalability and integrated workflow required for high-throughput analysis. To address this, we developed Pandoomain, a Snakemake pipeline that automates the acquisition of genomes from NCBI, identifies proteins of interest using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and performs systematic domain annotation and gene neighborhood analysis. We demonstrate the utility of Pandoomain through a comprehensive analysis of the poorly characterized pre-toxin TG (PT-TG) domain across 347,289 bacterial genomes. Our analysis revealed 10,226 PT-TG-containing proteins organized into 312 unique domain architectures, highlighting their association with diverse interbacterial antagonistic systems, including the Type VI, Type VII, and CDI systems. By leveraging genomic context, we identified a novel variant of the WXG trafficking domain, termed W10XG, and subsequently discovered 24 new families of associated toxin domains. We experimentally validated six of these toxins, confirming that five are neutralized by their cognate immunity proteins. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a significant enrichment of mobile genetic elements near W10XG and WXG domains compared to other trafficking domains, suggesting these loci are hotspots for genomic diversification. Pandoomain is an accessible tool that enables systematic, large-scale exploration of protein domains, and our analysis of the PT-TG domain provides a rich resource for future investigations into the mechanisms and evolution of bacterial antagonism.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

A.; Bohn, J. A.; Shattock, R. J.; Goncalves-Carneiro, D.", "abstract": "Innate immune sensors rely on ubiquitin ligases to calibrate antiviral responses, yet the rules governing substrate recognition by SPRY-containing ligases remain poorly defined. Here, we establish a large-scale structure-based screening pipeline using AlphaFold to systematically predict interactions between human nucleic acid sensors and SPRY-domain proteins. Our approach uncovered novel transient or degradation-sensitive interactions that are typically missed by proteomic methods, including a labile TRIM58-OAS1 complex. We show that SPRY domains dictate substrate specificity: TRIM25 preferentially engages ZAP, whereas Riplet favors RIG-I. Domain-swapping experiments demonstrated that SPRY domains are sufficient to reprogram ligase specificity and antiviral activity. Phylogenetic and structural analyses revealed that TRIM25 and Riplet evolved from a common ancestor but diverged in coiled-coil architecture and oligomeric state, while retaining conserved substrate preferences. Residue-level modeling identified hypervariable SPRY loops as critical determinants of recognition, a prediction validated by targeted mutagenesis of the TRIM25-ZAP interface. Finally, we show that distinct SPRY-containing ligases surveil self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccines: Riplet-RIG-I primarily responds when RNA is delivered by lipofection, whereas TRIM25-ZAP is engaged upon lipid nanoparticle delivery, with functional consequences for vaccine expression. Together, these findings demonstrate that SPRY domains encode recognition logic for ubiquitin ligases, that AlphaFold enables discovery of otherwise hidden interactions and that these principles have direct implications for RNA-based therapeutics.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we used an intracellular carboxylate reduction assay to show that apparent TPA uptake in E. coli cells that lack a dedicated TPA transporter sharply increases between pH 5-6. Furthermore, we discovered that glycol ester deconstruction products, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), surprisingly each result in rapid pH-independent uptake. We exploited glycol ester uptake along with deletion of 22 cellular oxidoreductases to design intracellular hydrolysis routes for synthesis of upcycled reduction products from BHET at >90% yields, and from real PET wastes after tandem catalytic glycolysis and cell-based valorization at >80% combined yields. Our work has important ramifications for PET utilization by cells and adds new perspectives on the evolution of the PETase/MHETase system.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

V.; Guidry, J.; Park, A.; Bowman, G.", "abstract": "A major challenge for many bio-manufacturing operations is that cells are burdened by the high fitness cost of product synthesis, limiting their growth and productivity. A potential solution is to decouple cell reproduction from product synthesis by dividing these conflicting tasks between two differentiated cell types. This work describes the use of an asymmetrically inherited protein cue to differentiate an E. coli culture into reproductive stem cells and fully dedicated factory cells. Cell differentiation is based on the ability to accumulate two factors: a variant of phage-derived T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) and GP2, a peptide that inhibits native host cell RNA polymerase. Activating these two factors in factory cells inhibited growth and focused them on T7RNAP-driven product synthesis. Preventing their accumulation in stem cells allowed this cell type to grow and divide asymmetrically, generating new factory cells in the process. These differentiating cell cultures generated over eight-fold higher target protein titers compared to factory cell-only controls. Because they include a mechanism for preventing leaky T7RNAP-driven gene expression in stem cells and pre-induction cultures, it was possible to generate strains with multiple plasmid-based copies of a cytotoxic target gene, whereas leaky expression made the same plasmid inviable in conventional protein expression strains. This versatile genetic system could be useful for generating higher product titers, particularly in cases where product synthesis causes cytotoxicity.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

M.; Ansdell, P.", "abstract": "The known fluctuations in ovarian hormone concentrations across the eumenorrheic menstrual cycle contribute to modulations in cortical excitability and inhibition. However, how such changes affect spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) has not been systematically studied. This research aimed to determine the effect of the menstrual cycle on corticospinal excitability and STDP. Twelve eumenorrheic female participants (age: 25 {+/-} 5 years), visited the lab in three menstrual cycle phases: early follicular (EF), late follicular (LF), and mid-luteal (ML). Visits comprised of corticospinal excitability (motor evoked potential [MEP]/Mmax), short-intracortical inhibition (SICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) measures, recorded in the resting first dorsal interosseous. Followed by a paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocol, utilising ulnar nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation (25 ms interstimulus interval) to elicit neuroplasticity. To assess the time course of STDP, measurements were repeated at 15 and 30-minutes post PAS. Corticospinal excitability (MEP/Mmax) was greater in the LF phase (p [&le;]0.002) compared to EF and ML, with no phase effects observed for SICI or ICF (p[&ge;]0.112). PAS elicited an increase in MEP/Mmax across all phases at 15-minutes (112 {+/-} 5, 115 {+/-} 5, and 113 {+/-} 7% baseline, p[&le;]0.010), whereas at 30-minutes only ML was facilitated (126 {+/-} 7% baseline, p=0.029). The present data demonstrates facilitatory STDP can be induced with PAS across the tested menstrual cycle phases, but responses are prolonged and potentiated in the ML phase. Additionally, increased corticospinal excitability in the LF phase is likely due to intrinsic changes within the descending tract, as no changes in intracortical neurotransmission were observed.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

G.; Cartas-Espinel, I.; Villaman, C.; Vidal, M.; Perez-Palma, E.; Espinal-Enriquez, J.; Martin, A. J.; Saez, M. A.", "abstract": "Rett syndrome is a monogenic disorder with an incidence of 95% in women, characterized by the complexity of studying the associated phenotype due to the heterogeneity in patient tissues from the stochastic silencing of the affected X chromosome. Furthermore, we are largely unaware of the cascade of alterations that occur in neurons due to transcriptional changes induced by the affected MECP2 gene. To address these challenges, an in-depth network analysis was implemented using organoid single-cell transcriptomic data derived from human patients. We performed a Weighted correlation network analysis and trajectory analysis to understand the differences in the developmental processes between samples, we followed by the generation of gene regulatory networks for each relevant cell developmental pathways to assess the master regulator that are involved in this process with potential therapeutic implications which we identified by integration with SFARI and Genes4Epi. The results were adapted into dynamic Boolean models from fitted with the transcriptomic data for validation in which we evaluated the attractor field from each reachable state . These approaches allowed us to explore differences in regulatory behavior in the developmental pathways. Our study provides an insight that pinpoints the cellular stages on which the regulation and compensatory mechanism activate and regulate Rett syndrome. We identified 19 Master regulators for the Dopaminergic developmental trajectory, as well as 34 Master regulator genes for the Gabaergic developmental trajectory. Dynamic Boolean modeling of this systems showcased a comprehensive understanding of the disrupted developmental pathways of Rett syndrome, highlighting the transitional states of potential within maturation trajectories as the key point of divergence in regulation for Rett syndrome. After complementing with enrichment and clinical relevant variant analysis, we identify the key actors in this system as NR2F1 and TCF4, with TCF4 suggesting a symmetrical compensatory relationship with MeCP2, and NR2F1 as possible link with wider developmental conditions, this concluded with highlighting the possibility of regulation in this condition being affected by the MAPK-ERK pathway of transcriptional regulation in this condition being affected by the MAPK-ERK pathway of transcriptional regulation, offering a novel angle for targeted research.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

Neural bases underlying this process consistently implicate a large-scale network with superior temporal sulcus (STS) as a central hub, alongside contributions from primary auditory and visual cortices and higher-order areas including prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex. This study aimed to provide causal evidence for the involvement of superior temporal gyrus (STG) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) in the simultaneity judgment (SJ) task using MRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In particular, we aimed to clarify temporal dynamics of these regions in audiovisual synchrony perception. Forty adults performed an SJ task in which they had to determine whether stimuli were synchronous or asynchronous. Single-pulse TMS was applied over bilateral IPS, STG, or the vertex at different delays following stimulus offset. Early stimulation of left IPS and right STG increased the proportion of \"synchronous\" responses. In contrast, later stimulation of bilateral STG was associated with reduced synchrony perception. These findings provide causal evidence for a dynamic interplay between parietal and temporal regions in audiovisual temporal integration. Early IPS and STG involvement facilitates temporal integration, while later STG activity promotes perceptual segregation.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}

R.; Chen, P.-Y.; Souroullas, G. P.", "abstract": "SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes regulate gene expression during development and differentiation. These complexes exist in distinct forms, including the polybromo-associated BAF (PBAF) complex, defined by the ARID2 subunit. ARID2 is frequently mutated in B cell leukemias, but its role in normal B cell development remains unknown. Using conditional knockout mice, we show that Arid2 deletion impairs B cell differentiation in vivo. Mb1-Cre-mediated deletion, active in early progenitors, caused a marked reduction of splenic and circulating Follicular B cells, whereas CD19-Cre deletion produced a milder phenotype. These defects were not due to altered proliferation or survival but reflected impaired differentiation potential. Transcriptomic profiling of isolated pro-B, pre-B, and Follicular B cells revealed that Arid2 loss disrupts stage-specific gene expression programs, with cumulative downregulation of B cell receptor signaling and altered lineage-specifying pathways. Functionally, Arid2-deficient mice exhibited impaired germinal center expansion after immunization and reduced IgG antibody production following transplantation. Together, these findings identify Arid2 as a critical regulator of B cell differentiation and maturation by coordinating transcriptional programs during early lymphopoiesis.", "date": "2025-10-01", "journal": ""}
