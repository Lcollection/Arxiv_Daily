Yet artificial muscles suffer from dynamic programmability, scalability, and responsiveness due to complex actuation mechanisms and demanding material requirements. Here, we introduce a design paradigm for artificial muscles, utilizing >10,000 microbubbles with targeted ultrasound activation. These microbubbles are engineered with precise dimensions that correspond to distinct resonance frequencies. When stimulated by a sweeping-frequency ultrasound, microbubble arrays in the artificial muscle undergo selective oscillations and generate distributed point thrusts, enabling the muscle to achieve programmable deformation with remarkable attributes: a high compactness of ~3,000 microbubbles/mm2, a low weight of 0.047 mg/mm2, a substantial force intensity of ~1.21 N/mm2, and fast response (sub-100 ms during gripping). Moreover, they offer good scalability (from micro- to -centimeter scale), exceptional compliance, and many degrees of freedom. We support our approach with a theoretical model and demonstrate applications spanning flexible organism manipulation, conformable robotic skins for adding mobility to static objects and conformally attach to ex vivo porcine organs, and biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion within ex vivo biological environments. The customizable artificial muscles could offer both immediate and long-term impact on soft robotics, wearable technologies, haptics, and biomedical instrumentation.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

ADGRG6/GPR126 is an aGPCR critical for axon myelination, heart development and ear development; ADGRG6 is also associated with developmental diseases and cancers. ADGRG6 has a large, alternatively spliced, five-domain extracellular region (ECR) that samples different conformations and is essential for receptor function in vivo. However, the mechanistic details of how the ECR regulates signaling are unclear. Herein, we studied the conformational dynamics of the conserved CUB domain which is located at the distal N-terminus of the ADGRG6 ECR and is deleted in an alternatively spliced isoform ({Delta}CUB). We show that the {Delta}CUB isoform has decreased signaling and is insensitive to inclusion of an activating splice insertion (+ss). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the CUB domain is involved in interdomain contacts to maintain a compact ECR conformation. A cancer-associated CUB domain mutant, C94Y, drastically perturbs the ECR conformation and results in elevated signaling, whereas another CUB mutant located near a conserved Ca2+-binding site, Y96A, decreases signaling. Our results suggest an ECR-mediated mechanism for ADGRG6 regulation in which the CUB domain instructs conformational changes within the ECR to regulate receptor signaling.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

However, the prevalence of this lifestyle within the phylum and their host specificity remain poorly known due to the scarcity of cultured representatives. Here, we describe a complex system consisting of a patescibacterium, its gammaproteobacterial hosts, and their respective phages based on enrichment cultures and metagenomic data from two shallow, geographically close, freshwater ecosystems. The patescibacterium, Strigamonas methylophilicida sp. nov., defines a new genus within the family Absconditicoccaceae. It grows as epibiont on cells of methanotrophic species of the gammaproteobacterial family Methylophilaceae. Strigamonas cells grow tightly attached to the host, sometimes forming stacks that connect two host cells. Despite a surprisingly large genome (1.9 Mb) compared to many other Patescibacteria, S. methylophilicida lacks many essential biosynthetic pathways, including the complete biosynthesis of phospholipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids, implying a dependence on the host to obtain these molecules. We also identified and assembled the complete genomes of one patescibacterial phage that might represent a new virus family within the class Caudoviricetes, and two Methylophilaceae phages predicted to have head-tailed and filamentous virions, respectively. The patesciphage uses a modified genetic code similar to that of its host and encodes four tRNA genes, including the suppressor tRNA gene for the UGA stop codon, which is reassigned to glycine in many Patescibacteria. Our results confirm a prevalent episymbiotic lifestyle in Absconditicoccaceae and further suggest a clade-specific adaptation of this patescibacterial family for gammaproteobacterial hosts.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

TDP43 proteinopathy, characterized by dysregulated nuclear export and cytoplasmic aggregation, is present in most ALS/FTD cases and is associated with a loss of nuclear function and genomic instability in neurons. Building on prior evidence linking TDP43 pathology to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), this study identifies a novel regulatory role for TDP43 in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. We demonstrate that depletion or overexpression of TDP43 affects the expression of key MMR genes, including MLH1, MSH6, MSH2, MSH3, and PMS2. Specifically, TDP43 modulates the expression of MLH1 and MSH6 proteins through alternative splicing and transcript stability. These findings are validated in ALS mice models, patient-derived neural progenitor cells and autopsied brain tissues from ALS patients. Furthermore, MMR depletion showed a partial rescue of TDP43-induced DNA damage in neuronal cells. Bioinformatics analysis of TCGA cancer database reveals significant correlations between TDP43 and MMR gene expressions and mutational burden across various cancer subtypes. These results collectively establish TDP43 as a critical regulator of the MMR pathway, with broad implications for understanding the genomic instability underlying neurodegenerative and neoplastic diseases.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we report that old yeast cells lose chromosomes by partitioning them asymmetrically to their daughter cells together with the pre-existing (old) spindle pole body (SPB, centrosome equivalent in yeast). Strikingly, remodelling of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the displacement of its nuclear basket triggered these asymmetric chromosome segregation events. Simultaneously, nuclear basket displacement caused unspliced pre-mRNAs to leak into the cytoplasm. We show that removing the introns of three genes involved in chromosome segregation was sufficient to fully suppress chromosome loss in old cells. Promoting pre-mRNA leakage in young cells also caused asymmetric chromosome partitioning and loss through the same three introns. Therefore, we propose that basket displacement from NPCs and its consequences for pre-mRNA quality control are key triggers of aging phenotypes such as aneuploidy.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

A.; Isada, M.; McCoy, R. C.", "abstract": "Chromosome mis-segregation is common in human meiosis and mitosis, and the resulting aneuploidies are the leading cause of pregnancy loss. Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) prioritizes chromosomally normal embryos for transfer based on analysis of a biopsy of approximately five trophectoderm cells from blastocyst-stage in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos. While modern PGT-A platforms classify these biopsies as aneuploid, euploid, or mosaic (a mixture of normal and aneuploid cells), the underlying incidences of aneuploid, euploid, and mosaic embryos and the rates of meiotic and mitotic error that produced them remain largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we paired a method for embryo simulation with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to infer rates of meiotic and mitotic error that explain published PGT-A data. Using simulation, we also evaluated the chromosomal status of entire embryos. For a published clinical sample, we estimated a 40-58% probability of meiotic error per meiosis and a 1.5-6.3% probability of mitotic error per mitosis, depending on assumptions about spatial organization. In addition, our analyses suggest that less than 1% of blastocysts are fully euploid and that many embryos possess low-level mosaic clones that are not captured during biopsy. These conclusions were relatively insensitive to misclassification of mosaic biopsies. Together, our findings imply that low-level mosaicism is a normal feature of embryogenesis and are consistent with clinical data demonstrating the developmental potential of mosaic-testing embryos. More broadly, our work helps overcome the limitations of embryo biopsies to estimate fundamental rates of chromosome mis-segregation in human development.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

A.; Townsend, J. P.", "abstract": "Background Tobacco smoke is a known mutagen. However, its physiological effects on the lung may also influence the somatic selective pressures acting on mutations, further shaping cancer evolution. The relative contributions of these mutagenic and physiological effects to oncogenesis have not been quantified, despite their importance in predicting the differential therapeutic effect of targeting variants in lung cancers of smokers and nonsmokers. Methods We classified 1,722 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) sample genomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other projects as ever-smoker (ES) or never-smoker (NS) LUAD based on smoking-associated mutational signature attribution or clinical annotation. We then independently calculated background oncogenic mutation rates in the ES- and NS-LUAD groups. Comparing these background rates to observed variant prevalences enabled us to estimate and compare the selective advantages conferred by each mutation in ES- and NS-LUAD. Finally, we quantified pairwise and higher-order epistatic effects by estimating selection for each mutation in specific somatic genotypes. Results As expected, background oncogenic mutation rates were gene-specifically elevated in ES-LUAD. However, differences in oncogenic mutation rates between ES- and NS- LUAD were insufficient to explain differences in the prevalence of some mutated genes, implying that such mutations must have further experienced differential somatic selection. In particular, KRAS, KEAP1, and STK11 mutations experienced substantially stronger selection in ES-LUAD, whereas mutations of EGFR, PIK3CA, SMAD4, and other genes were more strongly selected in NS-LUAD. Mechanistically, EGFR mutations were associated with upregulation of genes involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in NS-LUAD, but not in ES-LUAD. Epistasis was pervasive and distinct between the subtypes: ES-LUAD featured more frequent synergy and substantially less antagonism. These patterns entail divergent evolutionary trajectories, with NS-LUAD constrained to fewer, narrower paths and ES-LUAD exploring a broader, more permissive adaptive landscape. Furthermore, we identified higher-order epistasis--systematically examined here for the first time in cancer--manifesting as sub-additive and emergent synergistic interactions that selectively promote trajectories of oncogenesis. Conclusions This disambiguation of the mutagenic and selective effects of tobacco smoke reveals how environmental insult can reshape the evolutionary trajectories of LUAD and enables quantitative prediction of treatment vulnerabilities based on smoking status and tumor somatic genotype.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Phantom epistasis arises when, in the course of testing for gene-by-gene interactions, the omission of a causal variant with a purely additive effect on the phenotype causes the spurious inference of a significant interaction between two SNPs. This is more likely to arise when the two SNPs are in relatively close proximity, so while true epistasis between nearby variants could be commonplace, in practice there is no reliable way of telling apart true epistatic signals from false positives. By considering the causes of phantom epistasis from a genealogy-based perspective, we leverage the rich information contained within reconstructed genealogies (in the form of ancestral recombination graphs) to address this problem. We propose a novel method for explicitly quantifying the genealogical evidence that a given pairwise interaction is the result of phantom epistasis, which can be applied to pairs of SNPs regardless of the genetic distance between them. Our method uses only publicly-available data and so does not require access to the phenotypes and genotypes used for detecting interactions. Using simulations, we show that the method has excellent performance at even low genetic distances (around 0.5cM), and demonstrate its power to detect phantom epistasis using real data from previous studies. This opens up the exciting possibility of distinguishing spurious interactions in cis from those reflecting real biological effects.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Since GI motility is governed by the enteric nervous system (ENS), stress may act by altering ENS function. While stress activates glucocorticoid signaling via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the impact of stress-mediated glucocorticoid signaling on ENS biology remains poorly understood. In the central nervous system, glucocorticoids reduce specific isoforms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), impairing signaling through its receptor, TrkB, and contributing to behavioral dysfunction. However, the identity of ENS-specific Bdnf isoforms, their glucocorticoid sensitivity, and the effect of enhanced TrkB signaling on GI motility in stressed animals has not been characterized. Here, using male and female mice, we show that >85% of post-natal ENS Bdnf transcripts are glucocorticoid-responsive isoforms. We also demonstrate that both Bdnf and its receptor Ntrk2 (TrkB) are expressed by enteric neurons. In male mice, stress and administration of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist cause GI dysmotility, which we demonstrate is associated with significantly reduced Bdnf transcripts in the longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus (LMMP) tissue in vivo. Dexamethasone exposure also represses Bdnf transcript and mature protein levels in LM-MP tissue in vitro. Notably, treatment with HIOC, a selective TrkB agonist, rescues GI transit defects in dexamethasone-treated animals.

Bombus terrestris workers completed three foraging bouts in two artificial flower environments: one simulating a favourable environment with patches alternating high- and low-quality flowers (40% vs. 20% w/w sucrose solution), and the other a challenging environment with high-quality flowers alongside unrewarded ones (40% w/w sucrose solution vs. plain water). We hypothesised that bees would improve their foraging efficiency in both environments, but more rapidly in the more extreme one, where the greater reward difference creates stronger pressure to learn quickly. In both conditions, bees increased their sucrose intake per unit time over bouts. We also observed consistent differences in flower selectivity among individuals: in the favourable environment, bees that first visited high-quality flowers focused on them and avoided low-quality ones (became \"picky\"), while bees that first visited low-quality flowers kept visiting both types. Despite these differences, bees across environments and pickiness levels all reached similar sucrose intake rates by the third foraging bout, either by becoming more selective, collecting more sucrose solution, or reducing time spent foraging.

How the avascular CL meets this energetic demand remains a mystery. Here, we reveal a novel cellular adaptive mechanism-GC energy storage (GCES)-that resolves this enigma. We demonstrate that upon luteinization initiation, GCs enter a metabolically quiescent state yet enhance glucose uptake via SLC2A1, converting it into glycogen through the hCG (LH)-MAPK-RUNX1-Insulin signaling axis. Catabolism of this glycogen reserve supplies the energy required for the avascular CL, ensuring normal luteogenesis. GCES is evolutionarily conserved across mice, sheep and humans. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of GCES or glycogenolysis induces luteal insufficiency, whereas timely glucose administration enhances GCES, improving luteal function and optimize reproductive outcome in both mouse and ovine models.

Key signals involved in driving this plasticity are visuomotor prediction errors (Keller et al., 2012; Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018). Ideally however, the amount of plasticity induced by an error signal should be a function of several variables - including the total prediction error across all of cortex at that moment, the animal's experience in the current environment or task, stability of the current environment, and task engagement - for optimal computational performance. Candidates for regulators of visuomotor prediction error driven plasticity are the three major neuromodulatory systems that innervate visual cortex in the mouse: acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. While visuomotor mismatch acutely triggers activity in noradrenaline (Jordan and Keller, 2023) but not acetylcholine (Yogesh and Keller, 2023) axons in visual cortex, how serotonergic axons in cortex respond to visuomotor mismatch is unknown. Here, we characterized the activity of serotonergic axons in visual cortex (V1) and in area A24b, a motor cortical area in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), of awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Our results reveal cortical region-specific responses to visuomotor stimuli in serotonergic axons, but no evidence of a response to visuomotor mismatch. However, average activity in serotonergic axons was modulated by the recent history of visuomotor coupling. We speculate that serotonin could function to regulate visuomotor plasticity as a function of the predictability of the environment with a slow integration time constant.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce foundational principles of fitness landscape design (FLD) to customize the structural peaks and valleys of biophysical fitness landscapes with quantitative accuracy, offering robust control of long-term evolutionary outcomes. Our FLD algorithms use stochastic optimization of a chemically derived biophysical fitness model to consistently discover optimal antibody ensembles which force a target protein to evolve according to a user-specified target fitness landscape.

The molecular mechanisms driving this shift remain largely unexplored. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-Seq) across developmental retinal neurogenesis in the 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) to uncover the regulatory basis of this adaptation. We find that 13LGS cone photoreceptors arise not only from early-stage neurogenic progenitors, as seen in rod-dominant species like mice, but also from late-stage neurogenic progenitors. This extended period of cone generation is driven by a heterochronic shift in transcription factor expression, with cone-promoting factors such as Onecut2, Pou2f1, and Zic3 remaining active in late-stage progenitors, and factors that promote cone differentiation such as Thrb, Rxrg, and Mef2c expressed precociously in late-stage neurogenic progenitors. Functional analyses reveal that Zic3 and Mef2c are sufficient to promote cone photoreceptor and respress rod specification, and act through species-specific regulatory elements that drive their expression in late-stage progenitors. These results demonstrate that evolutionary modifications to gene regulatory networks underlie the development of cone-dominant retinas and provide insight into mechanisms of sensory adaptation and potential strategies for cone photoreceptor regeneration in vision disorders.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Two well-established concepts in flux regulation are transcriptional regulation, involving changes in enzyme levels through gene regulation, and allosteric regulation, involving changes in enzyme catalytic activities through metabolite binding.

Using models of different branch-point motifs, we find that asymmetric usage of a given co-substrate by reactions at and around a branch point induces flux switching at that branch point as influx increases. This provides cells with an inherent 'self-regulation' embedded in the architecture of metabolic pathways. We then develop a specific model of the yeast pyruvate branch point involving NADH usage. Using this model, we show that co-substrate based flux switching can explain experimental data on yeast metabolic overflow at high glucose influx, as well as how altering NADH dynamics shifts the initiation point of metabolic overflow. We conclude that asymmetric co-substrate utilisation around branch points provides an inherent regulatory mechanism that could explain observed relations between co-substrate dynamics and metabolic behaviours.

Despite dynamic transcriptional states, PDAC maintains a stable pancreatic epithelial identity that resists therapeutic intervention. This rigidity reflects robust transcriptional memory, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. While the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC; OSKM) can reprogram normal cells by overriding established cell identity, solid tumors like PDAC remain refractory, suggesting the presence of active epigenetic barriers. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate chromatin state and cell identity, but whether they actively enforce cancer-specific transcriptional memory and restrict reprogramming remains largely unexplored. Herein, through CRISPR interference screens targeting cancer-associated lncRNAs, we identified PDAC-enriched lncRNAs that restrict OSKM-mediated reprogramming. Knockdown of these lncRNAs enabled the acquisition of pluripotency-associated features, suppressed PDAC identity programs, and reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Among the most potent repressors of reprogramming were ATXN7L3-AS1, INTS4P2, and AC079921.2, which were upregulated in PDAC but minimally expressed in normal pancreas. While ATXN7L3-AS1 harbors pathogenic somatic variants in PDAC and is associated with mitotic progression-potentially contributing to the faithful inheritance of malignant programs, AC079921.2 is linked to extracellular matrix organization genes that resist suppression during OSKM induction. Thus, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for cancer-associated lncRNAs as key enforcers of transcriptional memory in PDAC. Targeting them provides a conceptual and therapeutic framework for erasing cancer cell memory, resetting the epigenetic state, and re-sensitizing PDAC cells to differentiation- or reprogramming-based interventions.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Working memory is a core feature of cognition that enables items to be maintained and manipulated over short durations of time. Stored information can be binary, such as the presence or absence of an object, or multivalued, such as the graded intensity or location of a feature. Remarkably, there are currently no computational models of working memory that can robustly maintain both the graded intensity and spatial location of a stored item. Here, we show how this limitation can be overcome if neurons contain multiple bistable dendritic compartments. We first illustrate the core mechanism in a simple network architecture for both a spiking model with conductance-based dendrites and a rate-based model that permits analytic understanding. We then implement this mechanism within a ring model architecture for spatial working memory, in which neurons are arranged in a one-dimensional line or ring such that the spatial location of an item is encoded by the set of neurons that are active. In contrast to classic ring models, which encode the binary presence and continuous location of an item, we show that the multi-dendrite-neuron model can robustly (without fine tuning and with minimal drift in response to noise) encode both the amplitude and the location of an item in working memory. This work provides a solution to the problem of encoding graded information in spatial working memory and demonstrates how dendritic computation can increase the capacity and robustness of working memory.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

While the static flexibility of DNA is well-characterised by the bending elasticity or persistence length, no equivalent quantity related to how quickly it responds to external mechanical or thermal forces has to date been characterised. Here, by analysing the single molecule fluctuations of DNA several kilobases long, and by developing new theory for bending dissipation in semiflexible polymers, we show that DNA bending dynamics cannot be explained by friction between DNA and the solvent alone and requires significant contribution of intramolecular DNA friction. This defines a new material constant of DNA - the bending friction constant - which we determined to be {zeta}B = 241{+/-}17g nm3/ms. This magnitude corresponds to bending friction dominating dynamics of short DNA - up to {approx}420nm or 1.24kbp - and a characteristic persistence time of DNA shapes of {approx}1.2ms. Using these values, our theory accurately predicts measured spontaneous looping times without any fitting parameters in stark contrast to the prevailing theory based only on solvent friction with DNA, which underestimates these times by 1,000-fold. Our measurement of DNA bending friction is also insensitive to changes in electrostatic screening suggesting that it is related to the local and complex energy barriers due to Watson-Crick base-pairs, base-stacking and their interaction with water molecules as DNA bends; this localised nature suggests an opportunity for biology to use specific sequence motifs to tailor the friction response of DNA. These findings change our understanding of DNA bending dynamics and highlight the nature of the fundamental trade-off between the speed limit for DNA bending by spontaneous fluctuations, versus the energy cost of manipulating DNA by enzymes, as necessitated by biological function and ultimately, natural selection.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Using reaction time analysis and a deep learning-based embedding of individual animals, we uncovered large but low-dimensional differences in behavioral traits. Some mice consistently exhibited anticipatory responses, marked by fast reaction times, while others showed slower, more disengaged behavior. These behavioral profiles were consistent across sessions, with female mice tending to show more anticipatory behavior than males. We hypothesized that this behavioral spectrum reflects differences in the depth of underlying cortical states, reflected in the temporal dynamics of neural activity. Supporting this idea, we found that the characteristic timescale of population activity, measured during both inter-trial intervals and passive periods, correlated with an animal's anticipatory tendency across cortical areas, especially in medial visual areas. These findings suggest that individual differences in the cortical dynamics may underlie distinct decision-making strategies.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Rather, the sleep-onset period (SOP) exhibits dynamic and non-monotonous changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) with high, and so far poorly understood, intra- and inter-individual variability. Computational models of the sleep regulation network have suggested that the transition to sleep can be viewed as a noisy bifurcation at a saddle point which is determined by an underlying control signal or ``sleep drive''. However, such models do not describe how internal control signals in the SOP can produce rapid switches between stable wake and sleep states, nor how these state-space changes are translated in the macroscopic EEG. Here, we propose a minimally-parameterized stochastic dynamical model, in which one slowly-varying control parameter drives the wake-to-sleep transition while exhibiting noise-driven bistability. We provide a procedure for estimating the parameters of the model given single observations of experimental sleep EEG data, and show that it can reproduce a wide variety of SOP phenomenology. Using the model to analyze a pre-existing sleep EEG dataset, we find that the estimated model parameters correlate with subjective sleepiness reports.

When RNAPII stalls on transcription-blocking lesions, the transcription-coupled DNA repair pathway is activated to remove the DNA damage.

PAF1C contributes to deposition of transcription-associated histone marks, including H2B-K120Ub, H3K4me3 and H3K79me2. These marks are enriched at actively transcribed genes and have been associated with regulation of post-repair transcription restart.

Moreover, levels of H2B-K120Ub and H3K4me3 do not correlate with transcription restoration following DNA damage.

Beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) over left and right sensorimotor cortex have been shown to encode motor action and exert inhibitory influence through lateralization of the post-movement rebound, biasing subsequent decisions toward responses with the other hand. This study investigated whether sensorimotor beta oscillations elicited by an isolated choice-unrelated motor action could influence a subsequent perceptual decision. Twenty-nine healthy adults (25 right-handed) completed a two-stage task while 64-channel EEG was recorded. In each trial, participants executed an initial button press with either the left or right thumb to a letter cue (\"L\" or \"R\") followed by, after a variable delay (0.5, 1.2 or 3 s), a briefly presented visual grating requiring a decision response on the orientation of the grating via a second button press. We computed the degree of beta power lateralization between left and right (pre-) motor cortical sources that was present during presentation of the grating stimulus and quantified choice bias as the threshold difference between psychometric curves fitted to left-versus right-initial response trials. Participants with stronger beta lateralization during stimulus presentation showed a greater tendency to alternate their decision response from the hand used for the initial button press and exhibited slower decision speeds. However, we failed to detect a significant group-level decision bias induced by the initial motor action, nor were there consistent within-subject correlations between decision bias and beta lateralization across delays. Following the perspective of embodied-decision making, our results partially support the influence of motor cortex activity on the choice process, while also suggesting that beta activity may serve as a trait-like index of individual susceptibility to decision bias.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

P.; Tinjaca, D. A.; Chaparro-Olaya, J.", "abstract": "Introduction. Leishmaniasis remains a major public health challenge in Colombia, driven by high incidence, Leishmania species diversity, and drug resistance. Colombian medicinal plants, rooted in rich ethnobotanical traditions and supported by the countrys exceptional biodiversity, represent a promising yet underexplored resource for the development of novel antileishmanial therapies. Aim of the study. To systematically assess Colombian medicinal plants with reported in vitro antileishmanial activity, to estimate pooled IC50 values through meta-analysis, and to identify extracts with favorable selectivity indices (SI) as potential antileishmanial candidates. Materials and methods. A systematic search (2000-April 2025) of PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS identified in vitro studies reporting IC50 values of Colombian plant extracts against Leishmania spp. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled IC50 values. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified QUIN tool. Subgroup analyses explored methodological and biological factors, such as plant part, extraction solvent, and taxonomic family. Results. Twenty-five studies were included, covering 110 records on 24 plant species. Thirteen studies with complete IC50 {+/-} SD data were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled mean IC50 was 41.25 {micro}g/mL (95% CI: 37.95-44.55), with substantial heterogeneity (I2=100%). Lower IC50 values were associated with bark/wood extracts, methanol or dichloromethane solvents, and species from the Chrysobalanaceae and Bignoniaceae families. Xylopia discreta (Annonaceae) showed the highest SI (up to 110). Additional species from the Lamiaceae, Lauraceae, Picramniaceae, and Rutaceae families also demonstrated favorable SI values. However, methodological variability limited the ability to make direct comparisons across studies. Conclusion. Several Colombian plant species showed promising in vitro antileishmanial activity, with selected extracts combining high potency and notably high selectivity. The inclusion of SI analysis in this review provides a more meaningful assessment of therapeutic potential beyond IC50 values alone. These findings underscore the value of Colombias plant biodiversity as a source of candidate compounds for antileishmanial drug development. However, standardized in vitro protocols, consistent cytotoxicity evaluation, and in vivo validation remain essential to ensure comparability and guide the selection and advancement of the most promising extracts toward therapeutic application.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Methods We included participants aged [&ge;] 60 years from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).SA absence of major diseases, absence of major chronic diseases, no impairment in physical function, high cognitive functioning, good mental health, and active participation in life. HGS asymmetry and weakness were measured using the maximum value of the HGS. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine the association of individuals with HGS asymmetry and weakness with SA. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling was used to explore potential nonlinear relationships. Results Of the 5,031 individuals included, the median age of the study population was 67 years IQR: 63-73 years, 45.6% female. Only 6.3% met the criteria for successful aging. HGS asymmetry (OR = 0.597,95% CI: 0.472-0.754) and weakness (OR = 0.643,95% CI: 0.417-0.964) were both independent influences on SA. Participants were less likely to have SA when both HGD asymmetry and frailty were present (OR = 0.426,95% CI: 0.240-0.757). Further subgroup analyses revealed significant associations between HGS status and each of the components of SA, particularly with regard to physical functioning. There was an n-shaped relationship between HGS asymmetry and SA. Conclusion HGS asymmetry is associated with a reduced likelihood of weak SA. Improving or maintaining HGS symmetry and frailty may contribute to SA in older adults.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

These mosquito-borne pathogens are obligately colonized by the gram-negative intracellular alphaproteobacterium Wolbachia pipientis, which is essential for nematode sexual reproduction, long-term survival, and pathogenicity in the mammalian host. Like many intracellular bacteria Wolbachia likely uses numerous surface-exposed and secreted effector proteins to regulate its ability to persist and replicate within nematode host cells. However, due to the inability to cultivate Wolbachia in the laboratory and the genetic intractability of both filarial nematodes and the bacterium, the molecular underpinnings that define the bacterium:nematode relationship are almost completely unknown. In this work, we show that the expression of a Wolbachia outer membrane lipoprotein, wBm0152, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibits the activity of the conserved Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) complex and strongly disrupts endosomal maturation, leading to defects in ubiquitylated protein turnover. Using in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we find that Wbm0152 interacts with the Vps2p subunit of the ESCRT-III subcomplex as well as the Vps2p ortholog (BmVps2, Bm6583b) from a Wolbachia host nematode, Brugia malayi.

Despite its clinical significance, the molecular mechanisms governing these differentiation trajectories at the fetal-maternal interface remain poorly defined. While Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF{beta}) has been implicated in trophoblast invasion, its role remains controversial. In this study, we report increased SMAD2/3 phosphorylation (pSMAD2/3), but reduced pSMAD1/5 and SNAIL levels in preeclamptic placentas. Mechanistically, we show that TGF{beta}1 induces transient SMAD1/5 phosphorylation via dual engagement of the TGF? type I receptor ALK5 and the BMP type I receptor ALK2 in both HTR8/SVneo cells and human trophoblast stem cells. Moreover, single-nucleus transcriptomics of first-trimester placentas revealed co-expression of ACVR1, TGFBR1, SMAD1 and SMAD5 at the transition zone between cytotrophoblasts and extravillous trophoblasts.

Black soil (BS) and fluvo-aquic soil (FS), two representative agricultural soils in China, exhibit contrasting N2O emission potentials, providing a unique model system for disentangling microbial mechanisms underlying soil-specific denitrification dynamics. Here, we integrated microbial co-occurrence networks, metagenomics, and functional phenotyping to identify and characterize keystone bacterial taxa involved in denitrification across the above mentioned two contrasting agricultural soils, BS and FS. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and correlation analyses revealed that keystone taxa are significantly associated with soil denitrification rates and N2O emission patterns. Among these,Ramlibacter ASV104 was identified as a conserved keystone in both soils, exhibiting genomic potential for key denitrification genes (nirK/nirS/norB/nosZ) to mediate N2O turnover. In contrast, Ensifer ASV205 was a FS-specific keystone taxon, exhibiting strain-level niche specialization. Comparative genomics revealed that variations in denitrification gene composition and carbon-nitrogen metabolism enable different Ensifer strains to function either as N2O sources or sinks. This functional divergence was linked to their genomic plasticity and growth strategies under nutrient-rich conditions. Our findings demonstrate that soil-specific denitrification processes and N2O emissions are governed by keystone taxa through adaptive genomic and metabolic strategies shaped by environmental filtering.

Synthetic and organic tampons sourced from domestic and international markets, both synthetic and organic, were tested for estrogenic bioactivity. Of the 18 brands analyzed, estrogenic activity was detected in nearly half, independent of material type. Comparative chemical analysis of one estrogenic-active brand versus one non-active brand via high-resolution mass spectrometry identified various plasticizers, surfactants, and fragrance agents, that were present in higher concentrations in the estrogenic-active brand. The list of chemicals included known EDCs, such as phthalates and alkylphenols, that may be responsible for the observed estrogenic activity. Notably, estrogenic activity varied by brand, suggesting formulation-dependent risk. Although the detected in vitro activity levels were low, the findings demonstrate that compounds capable of activating estrogen receptors can leach from tampons.

We present a minimal mathematical model that identifies essential buffering mechanisms while ensuring tractability and interpretability. Incorporating Kir channels and gap junction coupling, the model reproduces experimentally observed astrocyte membrane dynamics under various pharmacological conditions Parameter exploration reveals two levels of degeneracy. At the single-cell level, multiple parameter configurations yield similar membrane potential dynamics, indicating flexibility in local and spatial buffering contributions.

R.", "abstract": "Functional MRI (fMRI) tracks brain activity through the associated hemodynamic changes via neurovascular coupling. Neurons communicate with the microvessels of the parenchyma to initiate a hemodynamic response, and these microvessels then communicate with upstream arterioles and arteries. The role of the larger feeding arteries--far upstream from the site of neuronal activity--in coordinating this response is incompletely understood, yet is important for the interpretation of fMRI. Functional Transcranial Doppler (fTCD) can noninvasively measure blood velocity changes in a subset of the largest macrovessels, albeit with poor spatial resolution, whereas existing functional MR angiography (fMRA) methods can assess blood velocity in mid-sized macrovessels but still lack the temporal resolution required to capture dynamic responses. This study aims to propose a new, quantitative fMRA method for measuring blood velocity responses in individual vessels in humans at high spatiotemporal resolution. A dynamic functional phase-contrast MRA approach was developed to quantify responses evoked by visual stimuli in the ''P2'' segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), located ~6 cm away from primary visual cortex. The achieved temporal resolution is comparable to that of conventional blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, enabling block-design stimulation paradigms similar to those used in conventional fMRI studies. The temporal and spatial properties of the blood velocity responses were evaluated using both long- and short-duration visual stimuli presented to either the full visual field or a single hemifield. Robust responses were measured on both 3T and 7T clinical MRI scanners, and an approximately 3.3 {+/-} 1.2 cm/s increase in the blood velocity in the targeted segment was observed, which is roughly a 10% increase from baseline. Visual hemifield stimulation generated a measurable blood velocity response only in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere, indicating that systemic physiological changes occurring with stimulation cannot account for the observed response, suggesting that they instead reflect neurovascular coupling initiated in the visual cortex. The observed arterial blood velocity response is consistent with a downstream reduction in microvascular resistance and may represent a passive response rather than an active vessel dilation at the targeted arterial segment. The proposed method has the potential to extend the capability of commonly used approaches, such as fTCD, in clinical applications.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Notably, this rare biosphere (5) includes species performing critical ecological functions, such as biogeochemical cycling and resisting invasions (6-9). While bacterial abundance patterns have been extensively studied, the distribution of plasmids - extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements ubiquitous in bacteria - remains poorly understood. Using a dataset of 52,909 plasmids from isolates or bacteria and archaea (10), we found that their 16,547 Plasmid Taxonomic Units (PTUs) (11,12) exhibit a distribution with a long tail, whether in rank abundance or relative abundance distributions: a few highly prevalent PTUs and many rare. The relative abundance distributions are well described by a Poisson log-normal distribution, coherent with recent findings for species abundance distributions across several taxonomic groups (13). The host distribution also presents a long tail; however, we show that rare PTUs are not necessarily associated with rare bacterial species nor are common PTUs exclusively found in common hosts. This indicates that PTUs' distribution is not a direct consequence of hosts' distribution. Per plasmid, the host-range of rare PTUs is higher than that of common PTUs, at all levels, from species to phyla. Yet, plasmids from common PTUs are more mobile, likely explaining their success. The large group of rare PTUs constitutes an exceptionally diverse reservoir of genetic material, much more diverse than the group of common PTUs. Under appropriate selective pressures, some of these rare plasmids could spread not only by hitchhiking with their hosts but also through horizontal transfer.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Under homeostatic conditions, Microglia play critical roles orchestrating synaptic pruning, debris clearance and dead cells removals. In disease, they are powerful mediators of neuroinflammation, as they rapidly respond to injury or infection within the CNS by altering their morphology, proliferating, and releasing cytokines and other signaling molecules. Understanding the molecular pathways involved in microglial function is pivotal for advancing neurobiological research and developing effective strategies for CNS disorders. In this context, P2RY12 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is uniquely enriched in microglia in the parenchyma and a canonical marker of homeostatic, ramified microglia. However, P2RY12 is downregulated in activated microglia and in neurological conditions. The consequences of P2RY12 downregulation in disease-associated microglia and how they influence microglial activation remain poorly understood. In this study, we apply transcriptional and histological methods to explore the changes to microglia upon a genetic P2RY12 loss. Our findings reveal that P2RY12-deficient microglia experience alterations in distinct metabolic pathways while preserving overall homeostatic microglial transcriptional identity. Lack of P2RY12 alters signature genes involved in homeostatic iron metabolism. Importantly, the genes encoding proteins in the Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (Gpx4)-Glutathione (GSH) antioxidant pathway related to ferroptosis susceptibility are impaired upon microglial activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment.

To examine how fast neural information can be derived from fMRI signals, we performed experiments that acquire high-field (7T) fMRI signals at an ultra-fast sampling rate (TR = 125 ms) from the visual cortex while participants observed naturalistic object stimuli. We applied multivariate pattern decoders to extract presented object-category information from the acquired signals at each sampling time after stimulus onset. Results showed that decoding accuracy rose above statistical significance less than 2 s after signal onset, faster than the peak latency of the hemodynamic response. The peak latency of the decoding accuracy was independent of variations in the hemodynamic latency of voxels used for decoding. The application of sparse decoders further revealed that rapid and accurate decoding was possible by pruning vein-rich voxels off from the multivariate voxel input to the decoders.

Previous studies relied heavily on immortalized cell lines that exhibit properties different from cells in natural tissue environments. Most studies also quantified the expression of each gene by a single expression level, which fails to capture separate expression levels of different transcript isoforms of the same gene. In this study, making use of the latest large-scale dataset of paired transcriptomic and epigenomic data of human samples produced by the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC), we computationally modeled the expression levels of individual transcript isoforms in 324 samples from 29 tissue types. We constructed the models using graph-based methods that integrate both location-specific epigenomic features and multiple types of gene-gene relationships. We found that to infer transcript isoform expression levels in a sample, a model that integrates information from many samples of other tissue types consistently outperforms a model trained on data from this sample itself, providing strong support that it is possible to construct a \"universal\" model that can accurately infer transcript isoform expression levels across tissue types.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Wet-lab experiments for identifying essential genes are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although various machine learning methods have been developed for essential gene prediction, both systematic testing with large collections of gene knockout data and rigorous benchmarking for efficient methods are very limited to date. Furthermore, current graph-based approaches require learning the entire gene interaction networks, leading to high computational costs, especially for large-scale networks. To address these issues, we propose EssSubgraph, an inductive representation learning method that integrates graph-structured network data with omics features for training graph neural networks. We used comprehensive lists of human essential genes distilled from the latest collection of knockout datasets for benchmarking. When applied to essential gene prediction with multiple types of biological networks, EssSubgraph achieved superior performance compared to existing graph-based and other models. The performance is more stable than other methods with respect to network structure and gene feature perturbations. Because of its inductive nature, EssSubgraph also enables predicting gene functions using dynamical networks with unseen nodes and it is scalable with respect to network sizes. Finally, EssSubgraph has better performance in cross-species essential gene prediction compared to other methods. Our results show that EssSubgraph effectively combines networks and omics data for accurate essential gene identification while maintaining computational efficiency.

We discovered that the ability of K-RasG12D to influence the fitness of cells in a given tissue is not determined by its canonical signaling through MAPK. Instead, low baseline expression of c-Myc renders tissues non-permissive to oncogenic K-Ras, a context that can be reversed in the liver by ectopically expressing c-Myc.

Further, the neural processes underlying auditory imagery and perception have been shown to be similar. Therefore, we hypothesized that auditory imagery would rely on similar categorical processing. Participants learned shape-sound associations and were then asked to imagine the matching sound when presented with the associated shape. We chose two example stimuli from two maximally different sound categories (human speech sounds and nonhuman environmental sounds) to investigate our hypothesis. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded while participants listened to and imagined the sounds. The mean voltage in the P2 event-related potential time window (180-280 ms) was significantly larger for perception of the speech sounds than the environmental sounds, and the late positive event-related potential complex (LPC, 350-500 ms) associated with imagery was significantly smaller for imagery of the speech sounds than the environmental sounds.

However, the precise role of Rho-kinases in neurotransmitter release in vivo remains unclear. To clarify the role of Rho-kinases 1 and 2 in serotonin and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice in vivo, we investigated the effect of a nonselective Rho-kinase inhibitor, fasudil, and a selective Rho-kinase 2 inhibitor, KD025, using an in vivo microdialysis technique. Fasudil perfusion (1-20 M) into the NAc increased the basal extracellular serotonin level but did not affect dopamine levels, whereas KD025 (10-20 M) had little effect on basal serotonin and dopamine levels. Notably, fasudil perfusion into the NAc suppressed depolarization-induced serotonin and dopamine release in a dose-dependent manner, whereas KD025 selectively suppressed depolarization-induced serotonin release.

While these conserved glial immune responses are neuroprotective, our mechanistic understanding of glial immunity in the damaged and diseased brain is still incomplete. Here, using an in vivo nerve injury assay in the adult Drosophila olfactory system, we characterize a novel role for the transmembrane adhesion molecule Ninjurin A (NijA). We show that NijA is transcriptionally upregulated in neuropil ensheathing glia, but not local astrocytes, within hours after olfactory nerve transection. In NijA mutants, glia fail to properly infiltrate areas that contain severed olfactory nerves, and degenerating axonal debris is not cleared from the CNS. One well-defined signaling cascade critical for ensheathing glial clearance of damaged olfactory axons is the conserved MEGF10/Draper pathway, which includes the engulfment receptor Draper, downstream transcriptional complex AP-1, and known gene target MMP-1. We show that injury-induced transcription of NijA in responding glia requires the Draper receptor but is independent of MMP-1, suggesting a parallel signaling cascade is activated downstream of Draper in responding glia.

These thoughts contribute to substantial distress, poor treatment response, and increased risk of relapse. What makes perseverative thoughts persevere? Using task-based fMRI, we compared how adults with no lifetime psychopathology and adults with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or both, engaged top-down control processes to switch from personally-relevant perseverative or neutral thought to a working memory task. For only adults with clinical depression or anxiety, stopping perseverative thought was associated with more probable frontoparietal deactivation and more frequent default-mode activation versus stopping neutral thought. Using network control theory, we identified key control points that lead to these activity dynamics. We found that clinical perseverative thought elicited less controlled activity in the anterior cingulate cortex relative to thoughts in adults with no lifetime psychopathology, and lower control energy correlated with greater depression severity. The occipital-temporal, lateral prefrontal, and insular cortices also used less control energy in clinical perseverative thought. Low energy is characteristic of attractor states in dynamical systems theory, deep channels wherein the flow of activity naturally settles, analogous to how a ball needs little energy to roll to the bottom of a bowl yet more energy to leave it. Entrenchment in attractors provides a computational perspective on why top-down control signals relate to the persistence of clinical perseverative thought. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes of perseverative thought, paving the way for novel interventions for depression and anxiety.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Injury-induced gene expression changes were detected in the CTX, CC-EC and STR but not AC and were principally segregated based on cytoarchitecture, and secondarily by proximity to the site of impact. Additionally, unbiased spatial clustering revealed a positive relationship between proximity to the impact and the number of acutely differentially expressed genes within the laminar CTX. Gene pathways for interferon gamma response and for leukocyte-mediated migration and immunity were acutely enhanced across the injured CTX, CC-EC and STR. Within 1-week post-injury, transcriptional responses to injury in the CTX and CC-EC included gene pathways for adaptive T- and B-cell mediated immunity, whereas gene expression changes in the STR were largely resolved. Next, we examined the effects of systemic depletion of neutrophils and monocytes on spatial gene expression changes in the injured brain. This led to the upregulation of gene pathways functioning in synaptic transmission and an alternating down- and then upregulation of genes functioning in ribosomal messenger RNA translation and aerobic metabolism in mitochondria.

The membrane-bound AAA+ protease FtsH forms a large inner-membrane complex with the SPFH (Stomatin, Prohibitin, Flotillin, HflK/C) family transmembrane proteins HflK and HflC, playing a key role in bacterial recovery from aminoglycoside antibiotic stress. Recent structural studies have revealed both open, asymmetric and closed, symmetric conformations of the HflK/C assembly under different sample preparation conditions, suggesting two distinct models for how this complex modulates FtsH proteolysis. To determine which conformation reflects the biologically active state, we engineered a disulfide-crosslinked HflK/C variant to stabilize the closed conformation and resolved its structure using high-resolution cryo-EM. Phenotypic assays showed that cells expressing either this stabilized, closed HflK/C variant or an HflK/C mutant that disrupts interactions with FtsH exhibit significantly impaired growth under aminoglycoside stress. Surprisingly, the cryo-EM structure of the FtsH.HflK/C complex from cells challenged with the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin revealed a novel HflK/C arrangement, characterized by two openings on opposite sides that may facilitate substrate access to FtsH during proteotoxic stress. Together, our results suggest that both the dynamic open conformation of HflK/C and its specific interactions with FtsH are critical for adaptation to aminoglycoside-induced stress. Given the conserved structural and functional features of SPFH family members, our findings may offer a broader framework for understanding how this protein family operates under both basal and stress conditions.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify miR-27a and miR-27b as cooperative regulators of adipose tissue thermogenesis and adipogenic programming in the context of diet-induced obesity (DIO). Intervention of high-fat diet (HFD) to mice suppressed the expression of Ucp1, Ppary, and Pgc1a in inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT), which correlated with the increased expression of miR-27a/b. Using global knockout models for miR-27a and miR-27b, we identified that combined deletion of both miRNAs (double knockout, DKO) synergistically enhances Ucp1 expression, mitochondrial heat production and browning of WAT. DKO mice displayed improved glucose, insulin sensitivity and reduced adiposity under HFD conditions and outperformed single knockouts. In-vitro and ex-vivo analysis confirmed an increase in thermogenic gene expression and reduced lipid accumulation in DKO adipocytes. Collectively, our findings reveal that miR-27a/b cooperatively suppresses adipose thermogenesis and promotes metabolic dysfunction under obesogenic conditions. Targeting the miR-27a/b axis may offer a novel therapeutic approach to enhance energy expenditure and combat obesity-related metabolic diseases.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of the fecal microbiota of lactating Holstein dairy cows. A systematic online search of PubMed was performed in June 2023 to identify studies on the fecal microbiota of lactating Holstein dairy cows. Of the 526 articles retrieved from the systematic online search, only 28 met our required inclusion criteria. Raw sequencing data targeting the 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region) were obtained either from public repositories or directly from the authors. Two recently published articles were included as they met the inclusion criteria. A total of 2,136 samples were included in the analysis. The number of sequences per sample varied considerably between studies, and the metadata were sparse. The core microbiota was identified as the most prevalent and shared taxa, comprising 21 microbiota families that accounted for 82% of the relative abundance. The observed clustering, which depended on study, highlighted the significant impact of environmental factors and experimental conditions on the microbial communities of cattle. A multi-group analysis was performed to correct for the study effect and successfully identified three microbiota profiles. The meta-analysis approach is a rigorous and systematic method of analyzing research findings that allows for the generation of reliable and reproducible results. This approach ensures the independence of results from a single experimental facility or condition, thereby enhancing the reliability and generalizability of the findings.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

M.; Idrissi, M.; Hoang, Y.-N.; Huan, T.; Seib, D. R.; Soma, K. K.", "abstract": "Background: Intake of added sugars, such as sucrose, is high globally. In rats, a maternal high-sucrose diet (HSD) from 10 wk before pregnancy to embryonic day (E)19.5 has widespread impacts on maternal, placental, and fetal blood and brain steroid levels, including glucocorticoids, androgens, and aldosterone. Objectives: This study examined whether maternal HSD during pregnancy alone is sufficient to alter maternal, placental, and fetal steroids. Methods: Pregnant rats received either a control diet (1% kcal sucrose) or an isocaloric, nutrient-matched HSD (26% kcal sucrose) between E0.5-19.5. On E19.5, we collected maternal serum, placenta, fetal blood and brain, and amniotic fluid. We microdissected the placenta and fetal brain and measured 14 steroids using highly sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (n=12-15/diet/sex). Results: Maternal HSD during pregnancy alone did not alter maternal food intake, maternal body mass, and litter size (all p values [&ge;] 0.29, Student's t-test) but increased the percentage of males in a litter (p = 0.03, Student's t-test). Maternal HSD did not alter steroids in the maternal serum (all p values [&ge;] 0.21, Student's t-test), placenta (all p values [&ge;] 0.07, 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)), and fetal blood (all p values [&ge;] 0.13, 2-way ANOVA). Nonetheless, maternal HSD increased testosterone in the fetal nucleus accumbens (p = 0.04, 2-way ANOVA), decreased allopregnanolone in the fetal amygdala (p = 0.01, 2-way ANOVA), and decreased 11-dehydrocorticosterone in the amniotic fluid (p = 0.05, 2-way ANOVA). Conclusion: Maternal HSD during pregnancy alone does not affect steroid levels in the maternal serum, placenta, or fetal blood, but disrupts testosterone and allopregnanolone levels in critical regions of the fetal brain that regulate reward-seeking and emotion. Thus, while a long-term maternal HSD is necessary for widespread endocrine effects, the fetal brain is sensitive to short-term increases in maternal sucrose consumption during pregnancy.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

The neural mechanisms that give rise to this 'subitizing' limit are unclear. Here, we tested an account of the subitizing limit that attributes it to the amount of information that can be processed within one cycle of the 8-14 Hz alpha oscillation. This account proposes that the subitizing limit should be correlated with an individual's alpha oscillation frequency. We pitted this account against one based on neural excitatory:inhibitory balance, as indexed by the slope of the aperiodic component of the electrophysiological power spectrum. To test these accounts, we had human participants (N=51; 37 females) complete a visual enumeration task while we measured their brain activity with electroencephalography (EEG). We extracted aperiodic and alpha-band activity from the pre-stimulus period and correlated these with model-based estimates of individuals' subitizing capacity. Alpha oscillations were not correlated with subitizing capacity within-participants or as individual differences, but they were associated with other elements of enumeration performance, including baseline reaction times and the slope of the performance decrement outside the subitizing range. By contrast, individual differences in aperiodic slope reliably predicted individuals' subitizing capacity. These results suggest that differences in neural excitatory:inhibitory balance are the source of individuation-related capacity limits, not alpha-frequency sampling.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

In this work, we present TRAMFIX: a multisite dataset of travelling participants (n=10 healthy adults) scanned across four 3T MRI scanners using a harmonised multi-shell DWI protocol. DWI data were processed using two pipelines that can adopted when performing multi-site FBA studies (site-specific versus pooled processing). We extracted fixel-based measures of fibre density (FD), fibre cross-section (FC), and fibre density and cross-section (FDC), as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from the harmonised protocol. Within-subject coefficients of variation (CVws) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of FBA and DTI measures were computed at multiple resolutions of computation and analysis: (i) the whole-brain averaged level, (ii) tract-level, and (iii) fixel- or voxel-level. Fixel-based metrics demonstrated high reproducibility and reliability at the whole-brain level (CVws ranging between 0.51 % to 1.57 % and ICC between 0.93 and 0.996). While reproducibility and reliability remained high for tract-averaged FBA measures (particularly the FC and FDC metrics), some tracts exhibited lower ICC values < 0.8 for the FD measure. When examining fixel-level reliability and reproducibility clear spatial patterns emerged, with lower ICC across subcortical and cerebellar regions, and higher CVws at the cortical boundaries. Across all levels, tensor-based metrics demonstrated slightly lower reproducibility and reliability metrics than FBA measures, suggesting that FBA metrics are just as, if not more, reproducible than DTI metrics across scanners when using identical protocols. Our findings provide support for the reproducibility and reliability of fixel-based measures, highlighting their potential for use in multi-site FBA studies.

Participants performed a novel dual-task paradigm involving either self-referential (IDA) or perceptual processing of adjectives, involving externally directed attention (EDA), followed by a color recall task. IDA enhanced late positive potentials (LPP) in EEG over medial-frontal electrodes as a marker of sustained affective and self-referential engagement. Time frequency analyses further revealed increased event-related desynchronization in alpha and beta bands during stimulus encoding in the IDA condition, as well as increased alpha synchronization during the delay period, consistent with internal attention maintenance. To capture trial-level variability in task performance, we applied conditional quantile regression on the single-trial data. Results showed that beta desynchronization in interaction with condition type during encoding influenced performance significantly in trials with low errors, whereas trials with high errors in color recall were better explained by increased reaction times. These findings provide converging electrophysiological evidence for distinct neural signatures of internally directed attention and highlight their behavioral consequences in working memory performance.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

However, signaling molecules that regulate glial activation status are not fully understood. Microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) has been implicated in both immune responses and AD pathology. Here, we report that MARK2 negatively regulates glial immune responses, which protects against neurodegeneration. We found that MARK2 knockdown in the BV2 murine microglial cell line enhanced IL-6 expression in response to LPS. MARK2 knockdown enhanced IL-6 expression induced by TLR7 agonist but not stimulation of RLR pathways and cGAS-STING. In the brains of PS19 tauopathy mice, MARK2 was elevated in homeostatic microglia but reduced in activated microglia. In Drosophila expressing human tau in the retina, expression of AMP downstream of the Toll pathway in the pigment glia enhances degeneration of photoreceptor neurons. Glial knockdown of Par-1, the Drosophila ortholog of MARK2, enhanced Toll-mediated AMP expression and neurodegeneration, whereas overexpression of Par-1 in the pigment glia suppressed them.

This study demonstrates a crucial interaction between HPV16 and SMARCAL1, a protein involved in the stabilization of stalled DNA replication forks. SMARCAL1 can complex with E2, is recruited to E1-E2 replicating DNA, and SMARCAL1 knockdown reduces the fidelity of E1-E2 mediated DNA replication in C33a cells but does not alter replication levels. SMARCAL1 is recruited to the HPV16 genome in HPV16-immortalized foreskin keratinocytes (HFK+HPV16), and in situ protein interaction with nascent DNA replication forks (SIRF) assays demonstrated that SMARCAL1 is hyper-recruited to host replication forks in HFK+HPV16 cells. Using COMET, DNA fiber, and cell growth assays it was determined that knockdown of SMARCAL1 increased DNA damage and impaired replication fork progression in HFK+HPV16 cells, ultimately resulting in growth arrest. The viral genome integrates following SMARCAL1 knockdown in HFK+HPV16 cells. Therefore, SMARCAL1 facilitates host and viral DNA replication in HFK+HPV16 cells. Overall, the results demonstrate that HPV16 promotes SMARCAL1 recruitment to viral and host replication forks and is an essential factor for the HPV16 life cycle. The results expand our understanding of DDR proteins that regulate the HPV16 life cycle, and suggest that inhibition of SMARCAL1 function represents a novel anti-viral strategy for the treatment and prevention of HPV infections.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

While most bacteria and eukaryotes rely on the MutS and MutL protein families for MMR, many archaeal and actinobacterial species, including the major human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, lack these components. Instead, they utilize NucS, a structurally and evolutionarily distinct enzyme driving a non-canonical MMR pathway. Given the role of MMR in mutation control, understanding how nucS expression is regulated could be essential for uncovering the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance development in mycobacteria. In this study, we defined the promoter region and transcription start site of the nucS gene in Mycobacterium smegmatis. We found that nucS expression is growth phase-dependent in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, significantly decreasing during the stationary phase. This downregulation mirrors that of canonical MMR components, aligning with replication activity. Additionally, we present evidence that the alternative sigma factor {sigma}B may negatively regulate nucS expression during the stationary phase. We also identified candidate compounds capable of modulating nucS expression, underscoring its responsiveness to environmental cues. These findings deepen our understanding of mycobacterial stress adaptation and provide a groundwork for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance. Strikingly, our work reveals a case of double convergent evolution: both canonical (MutS/MutL) and non-canonical (NucS) pathways have independently evolved not only the same DNA repair function, but also similar regulatory frameworks for genome integrity preservation under stress conditions.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

It remains challenging to disentangle the roles of the indirect fitness benefits of helping kin and the potential direct fitness benefits helpers receive in the evolution of cooperative breeding. While many studies test for associations between helper relatedness and helping effort, few estimate the realized fitness consequences of helping in relation to these factors. Understanding these fitness outcomes elucidates the selective forces that maintain helping behavior, whether through inclusive fitness gains by helping related individuals or as a means of gaining access to later direct fitness benefits. Using 29 years of extensive demographic data from a closely monitored population of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens), we quantified the effect of helpers on breeder survival, offspring survival, and nestling production and how these effects depend on relatedness and sex of helpers. We found that female breeder survival was significantly greater when more helpers were present and that offspring survival was greater when more male helpers were present on small territories. Neither effect of helpers depended on the relatedness between helpers and the individuals they helped.

The occurrence of RHF and TR represents a critical indicator of hospitalization rates and all-cause mortality. However, RHF has remained understudied, specifically with respect to the tricuspid valve, with few animal models to investigate the transformative processes and identify novel interventions. Methods: Using the outbred sheep (Ovis aries) model of pulmonary artery banding (PAB) that induces RHF and TR, we generated three batches of ribosomal reduced RNA sequencing for 354 samples (NCBI SRA PRJNA1182691) containing right ventricle, left ventricle, each tricuspid valve leaflet, each mitral valve leaflet, and the pulmonary artery that represents both male and female sheep. The reads were assembled into a de novo sheep heart transcriptome for differential analysis. Results: The de novo sheep heart transcriptome enhanced transcript mapping of reads by 43-45% in the heart valves relative to the known sheep reference transcriptome. The identified transcripts produce validated tissue-specific pathways in ventricles (2,756 isoforms), pulmonary arteries (535 isoforms), and valves (1,215 isoforms), with transcript differences between the mitral and tricuspid valve involved in extracellular and endocrine signaling. The transcriptome also produced robust sex differences encoded by sex chromosomes and autosomes, highlighting epigenetic and sex hormone differences in the heart. Echocardiography and differential expression suggest that 8 weeks after PAB, the right ventricle has extensive morphological changes and known stress-induced lipid processing dysregulation. At 16-weeks post-PAB, tricuspid valve leaflets show the most significant transcriptional changes, with alterations in endocrine and immune pathway genes involved in cellular and extracellular remodeling. Genes within the tricuspid valve with differential expression and known human or mouse heart phenotypes include FLNA, LTBP4, VDR, CR2, PIGQ, CENPF, ACKR3, CR1, KLF2, and HIF3A. Conclusions: This project highlights the complexity of heart valve tissues and their transcriptional activity in a sheep model of RHF.

To address this challenge, we propose a scalable computational framework for predicting gene expression (ScPGE) from discrete candidate CREs (cCREs). ScPGE assembles DNA sequences, transcription factor (TF) binding scores, and epigenomic tracks from discrete cCREs into 3-dimensional tensors, and then models the relationships between cCREs and genes by combining convolutional neural network with transformer. Compared with current state-of-the-art models, ScPGE exhibits superior performance in predicting gene expression and yields higher accuracy in identifying active enhancer-gene interactions through attention mechanisms. By comprehensively analyzing ScPGE's predictions, we find a pattern in true positives (TPs) that the regulatory effect of cCREs on genes decreases with distance. Inspired by the pattern, we design two methods to enhance the ability to capture distal cCRE-gene interactions by incorporating chromatin loops into the ScPGE model. Furthermore, ScPGE accurately discovers some crucial TF motifs within prioritized cCREs and reveals the different regulatory types of these cCREs.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

I.; Vernerey, F. J.", "abstract": "To understand the emergence and role of nematic ordering in cell monolayers, it is crucial to capture accurate cell geometries and their alignment with neighbors. In this regard, existing agent-based models (ABMs), such as vertex and Voronoi models, lack generality, limiting the range and richness of their applications. In particular, these models often fail to accommodate complex cell geometries or do not implement thermodynamically well-posed rules for topological transitions. These features are essential for describing the biophysics of several morphogenetic processes, where irregular cell shapes and dynamic cell rearrangements play central roles. To address the limitations of existing models, we present a novel computational framework, referred to here as the morphodynamic network model (MNM), for simulating confluent cell monolayers. The MNM is a cell center-based ABM in which the cell centers (or nodes) are connected to form a dynamic triangulation (or topological) network. The node positions and topological structure (denoting connections between neighboring cells) evolve according to a split-step approach: motion of nodes at a fixed topology, followed by reconstruction of the topological network at fixed node positions. The MNM is then applied to study some of the morphodynamic behavior of cell monolayers. These include fluidization, elasto-visco-plastic response, nematic ordering, and substrate-induced cell alignment. The MNM is designed to capture complex behaviors, offering a flexible and robust tool for studying multicellular phenomena.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

T.; Terstappen, F.", "abstract": "Background: L-arginine and L-citrulline improve vascular health in Preeclampsia (PE) and Fetal growth restriction (FGR). However, the short half-life of these amino acids limits their efficacy. This study investigates pharmacokinetics, delivery, and therapeutic outcomes of liposomal encapsulation of L-arginine and L-citrulline in a rat model of PE and FGR. Methods: Firstly, the pharmacokinetics of liposome-encapsulated L-arginine (Encapsulated L-arg) was compared to that of free L-arginine (Free L-arg) in normal pregnant (NP) dams, following single intravenous administration. Secondly, the therapeutic effect on maternal blood pressure and fetal weight were studied in NP rats and the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) model for PE and FGR. Treatment groups consisted of Encapsulated L-arginine and L-citrulline (Encapsulated AAs); ratio 1:1, Free L-arginine and L-citrulline (AAs), or PBS, administered intravenously for five consecutive days. Blood and organs were analyzed for amino acid concentrations and fluorescence to assess the biodistribution profile of the liposomes. Nitrite and nitrate were quantified to measure changes in endogenous nitric oxide production in the pharmacokinetic study. Results: Liposomal encapsulation increased the area under the curve of blood arginine concentration-time curves >120-fold. Encapsulated AAs led to a marked increase in plasma and placental tissue concentrations compared to their free forms. Encapsulated AAs reduced maternal blood pressure in RUPP without affecting fetal weight. Enlarged spleens were observed in both Encapsulated AAs groups. Conclusions: The enhanced pharmacokinetics enabled by liposomal encapsulation effectively increased placental delivery of L-arginine and L-citrulline and reduced hypertension. Optimizing composition could enhance efficacy on FGR, making Encapsulated AAs a promising strategy for managing PE and FGR. The etiology of the observed maternal splenomegaly observed warrants further research before this novel approach can be clinically implemented.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

However, literature investigating if non-invasive brain stimulation could hold any potential to initiate process of adult neurogenesis are scarce. In the present study, with the use of behavioural, microscopic and biochemical tools we found that extremely low frequency magnetic field at an intensity of 17.96{micro}T with sinusoidal wave of 50Hz for 2hr daily for a period of two week in streptozotocin induced animal model of sporadic Alzheimer disease can cause improvement in spatial and reference memory, influencing their swimming strategy in water maze. Which is caused by stimulation in immature neural pluripotent stem cells, with additional redox balance and mitigation of glial aggravation in brain areas like olfactory bulb, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. These changes were accompanied by neuroprotection as observed in the granular layer of dentate gyrus.

A.; Corradi-Dell'Acqua, C.", "abstract": "Predicting another's pain is a challenging decision. Predictive coding explains individual pain via top-down modulation, but its extension to vicarious pain is unknown. We tested neural representations of expected pain, uncertainty (risk), and their related errors for self versus other to assess predictive coding's explanatory power in decisions on another's pain. We hypothesized that the brain encodes expected pain, risk, and prediction errors for others, mirroring self-pain mechanisms within a predictive coding framework. Using model-based fMRI (n=33), individuals in dyads gambled on risky or certain pain relief; priced their choices; experienced or witnessed corollary pain, and rated the latter's intensity, alternating between deciding for themselves or another. Behaviorally, prosocial biases emerged in the form of greater risk aversion, higher pain relief valuation, and inflated ratings for others. Neurally, expected other-pain showed a graded representation (absent for self). Pain risk activated the dorsal striatum for both self and other, but more so for others. Pain surprise, but not signed prediction errors, elicited anterior insula activity in both targets. These findings show that predictive coding can characterize vicarious pain, suggesting that top-down priors influence decisions on another's expected and experienced pain. Importantly, the observed prosocial biases and enhanced neural processing of risk for others highlight that uncertainty exerts a stronger influence in other-regarding decision-making compared to self-regarding choice. These findings lead to significant implications for social interactions and clinical contexts involving surrogate decision-makers.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

While emerging studies have begun to explore neural similarity, little is known about the factors that influence parent-child neural similarity during adolescence or how such similarity may support youth emotional adaptation when coping with heightened uncertainty. The current study investigated the relations among family relationship quality, parent-youth neural similarity, and youth emotional adaptation using task-based fMRI. With 50 participants (25 parent-youth dyads; parent: Mage = 43.88 years, 72% female; youths: Mage = 11.16 years, 44% female), we found that higher parent-youth neural similarity in the amygdala activation patterns during emotionally uncertain situations was associated with better youths' emotional adaptation, as indicated by lower levels of anxiety and depression and higher resilience. This neural similarity mediated the beneficial effects of positive family relationships on youths' emotional adaptation. Additionally, amygdala activation similarity was associated with amygdala to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) connectivity during uncertainty in youth, revealed by generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses. This amygdala-dlPFC connectivity, in turn, was linked to better emotional adaptation in youth. Importantly, these findings were specific to uncertainty-related bottom-up processing, rather than effortful top-down regulation processing or responses to certain aversive stimuli. These findings offer new insight into how relational and neural factors jointly shape youth emotional adaptation, and suggest that parent-child neural similarity in the amygdala may serve as a mechanism for supporting implicit emotion regulation, helping youth cope with uncertain situations.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

The {theta}NK model introduces a parameter {theta} to integrate local Rough Mount Fuji-type correlations in subgenotype contributions, simulating more biologically realistic correlated fitness effects. The HNK model incorporates gene regulation effects by introducing a masking mechanism where certain loci modulate the expression of other loci, simulating effects observed in gene regulatory networks without modeling the full network. Through extensive simulations across a wide range of parameters (N, K, {theta}, and H), we analyze the impact of these modifications on landscape accessibility and the number of local optima. We find that increasing {theta} or the number of masking loci (H) generally enhances accessibility, even in landscapes with many local optima, showing that ruggedness doesn't necessarily hinder evolutionary pathways. Additionally, distinct interaction patterns (blocked, adjacent, random) lead to different observations in accessibility and optimum structure. While more complex than traditional NK, we believe each model provides a new biologically relevant facet to fitness landscapes and provides insight into how genetic and regulatory structures influence the evolutionary potential of populations.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

We generated genome assemblies for two P. theobromicola isolates using long-read sequencing and five additional isolates using short reads. Comparative analysis revealed a genome size and predicted gene content comparable to P. citrophthora, a closely related species with a broad host range that includes both citrus and cacao. An intraspecies sequence-graph analysis revealed a highly dynamic genome structure with high proportion of variable effectors. Syntenic orthology analysis across 13 Phytophthora species identified orthologous gene groups conserved only in cacao pathogens and others specific to P. theobromicola. RxLR effectors and CAZymes were particularly enriched among lineage-specific syntenic groups, with RxLRs preferentially located near transposable elements and within gene-sparse, repeat-rich regions. Transcriptome analysis of infected cacao tissues showed that 88% of predicted effectors were expressed, with pods exhibiting the highest number of upregulated genes. Notably, several RxLRs classified as P. theobromicola-specific syntenic orthologs were highly expressed in infected tissues, suggesting that these lineage-specific effectors may play key roles in host-pathogen interactions unique to cacao. Together, our findings highlight the dynamic architecture and functional plasticity of the P. theobromicola genome, providing foundational insights into its virulence strategies and supporting future studies on host adaptation and effector evolution in emerging cacao pathogens.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

In previous studies, we demonstrated that Relndel/+ mice exhibit cognitive impairments in a visual discrimination test. Here, we found that Relndel/+ mice displayed impairments in social novelty recognition, while social preference remained intact. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed a significant decrease in the numbers of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-positive glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons, and parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Relndel/+ mice. Furthermore, Relndel/+ mice exhibited significant deficits in excitatory spine density and morphology, as well as a decrease number of PV boutons in the mPFC compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Finally, we demonstrated that injection of AAV-R36-Myc virus into the mPFC can improve social novelty impairments in Relndel/+ mice, but no effects on WT control. These findings indicate that Relndel/+ mice could be a valuable model for exploring the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive and social impairments in SCZ. Furthermore, our results with AAV-R36-Myc also suggest the therapeutic potential of Reelin replacement, warranting further investigation as a possible treatment strategy for SCZ.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate a potent and broad-spectrum strategy that employs hybrid biomaterials of Urumin (a host defense peptide) and a honeycomb (HC) DNA origami through spatially organized multivalent presentation for enhanced antiviral efficacy. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that Urumin penetrates and destabilizes the hemagglutinin (HA) trimer core, disrupting influenza A viral (IAV) entry. Arranging Urumin in trimeric clusters on the HC enables potent multivalent binding to trimeric HAs on IAV, enhancing antiviral efficacy at nanomolar concentrations, ~1,000-fold more effective than free Urumin. In vitro assays confirm HC-Urumin outperforms free Urumin in blocking viral entry and preserving cell viability in more IAV subtypes. In vivo studies show that compared to free Urumin, HC-Urumin treatment reduces disease severity, preserves physiological behavior, and decreases mortality in infected mice, while maintaining virus-specific adaptive immune responses without altering humoral immunity.

Thalamic volumes were compared between trauma-exposed participants with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n=238), major depressive disorder (MDD) (n=184), comorbid PTSD+MDD (n=618), and trauma-exposed control participants (n=1,018). PTSD and MDD symptom severity, PTSD symptom clusters, and childhood trauma were similarly examined for associations with thalamic volume. Participants with PTSD only compared to controls had smaller thalamic nuclei volumes in sensorimotor nuclei, including the parafascicular (Pf), ventral anterior magnocellular (VAmc), medial pulvinar (PuM), and anterior pulvinar (PuA) nuclei of the thalamus. MDD only and comorbid PTSD+MDD participants exhibited smaller mediodorsal thalamus volumes compared to controls. Overall PTSD and MDD symptom severity negatively correlated with the volume of the mediodorsal thalamus. A significant interaction between PTSD and MDD severity was found, such that MDD severity was positively associated with thalamic volume only among individuals with high PTSD severity. Avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD were positively associated with thalamic volume, while re-experiencing and negative mood/cognition symptoms were negatively associated with thalamic volume. Childhood physical and emotional abuse were positively and negatively associated with thalamic volume, respectively. Whole thalamus volume and volumes of the sensorimotor and limbic thalamus may play an important role in the development of PTSD and MDD in the aftermath of trauma exposure.

Despite its importance, the underlying genetic and regulatory architecture controlling this process varies significantly between species. In cyclorrhaphan flies, such as Drosophila melanogaster, anterior determination is controlled by the transcription factor bicoid, which emerged through duplication of the ancestral Hox3 gene (called zen in insects). With new, high-quality genomic data we mine the genomes of 186 dipteran species, and find presence of bicoid in non-cyclorrhaphan flies, including in the bee flies (family Bombyliidae) and the stiletto flies (Therevidae). We confirm maternal expression and localisation of the non-cyclorrhaphan bicoid mRNA to the anterior region of the unfertilised oocyte in the dark edged bee fly, Bombylius major. To determine the timing and origin of bicoid, we address uncertainty in the dipteran phylogeny, uncovering a ladder-like topology in the branching orders of the early Brachycera lineages. This new species phylogeny suggests that bicoid emerged at the common ancestor of Bombyliidae, Asiloidea, and Eremoneura (collectively Heterodactyla), and was subsequently lost at least 16 times. These findings expand our understanding of the early developmental processes in flies and provide new insights into the backbone phylogeny of Diptera and the evolution of bicoid.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

In this study, we have studied the role of one of the m6A writer complex proteins, WTAP and the m6A RNA demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity associated protein) in 2D and 3D culture systems of triple negative breast cancer cells. Genome edited cell lines where WTAP or FTO levels were downregulated show altered cell proliferation through m6A mediated regulation of cell cycle regulators, and altered cell migration properties through modulation of EMT markers.

M.; Xia, C.", "abstract": "Elucidating the spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression during plant organogenesis is crucial for enabling precise crop improvement strategies that incorporate beneficial traits into crops while avoiding adverse effects. Root nodules, specialised organs formed in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, provide a valuable system to study cell-type-specific gene networks in a symbiosis-induced developmental context. However, capturing these dynamics at cellular resolution in intact plant tissues remains technically challenging. Spatial transcriptomics technologies developed for animal systems are often not directly transferable to plant tissues due to fundamental differences in tissue composition between plants and animals, including rigid and heterogeneous plant cell walls, high cell wall autofluorescence, and large vacuoles in plant cells that complicate probe access and signal detection. To address these challenges, we present an optimised protocol for applying the Xenium in situ sequencing platform to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of plant tissues, including Medicago truncatula roots and nodules. Key technical adaptations include customised tissue preparation, optimised section thickness, hybridisation conditions, post-Xenium staining, imaging, and downstream image analysis, all tailored specifically for plant samples. To mitigate autofluorescence and enhance detection sensitivity, we employed a strategic approach to codeword selection during probe design. Furthermore, we developed a modular probe design approach combining a custom 380-gene standalone panel with a 100-gene add-on panel. This design allows flexibility for addressing diverse research questions and includes orthologous gene sequences from two Medicago ecotypes, ensuring compatibility for downstream functional validation using mutant lines available in both genetic backgrounds. We validated the protocol across nodules at multiple developmental stages using both the 50-gene panel targeting mature nodule cell identity and the extended 480-gene panel, which includes markers across different cell types and developmental stages, as well as genes of interest identified from prior single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses. This optimised workflow provides a reproducible and scalable method for high-resolution spatial transcriptomics in plant tissues, establishing a robust foundation for adaptation to other plant species and developmental systems.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we reveal that prefrontal cortical- and nucleus accumbens-projecting paraventricular thalamic neurons (PVTNAc) exhibit sleep-stage dependent activity and modulate cortical REM oscillation in response to stress. We found that PVTNAc bidirectionally modulate the REM-promoting medullary GABAergic signal, and thus, cortical theta oscillation during REM sleep in an activity-dependent manner, along with the excitation-inhibition balance observed during natural sleep stage transitions. While acute stress enhances REM sleep, repeated stress suppresses it through progressively increased PVTNAc activation. Notably, acute and chronic stimulation of PVTNAc recapitulates stress-induced bidirectional changes in REM sleep. Thus, PVTNAc neurons, by integrating stress and REM signals into forebrain activity, dynamically shape sleep architecture. Persistent elevation in this pathway disrupts REM sleep, thereby providing a mechanism through which stress alters prefrontal cortical processing and, ultimately, cognitive functions.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear whether these biochemical changes also manifest within the central nervous system or are confined to peripheral metabolism, reflecting systemic metabolic disturbances. Methods: To address this issue, here we measured the levels of 44 different amino acids in post-mortem brain samples from MPTP-intoxicated, L-DOPA-treated monkeys and PD patients at different Braak Lewy body (LB) stages, compared to their respective controls, through targeted Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Results: In MPTP-intoxicated monkeys, UPLC-MS revealed significant elevations in GABA, citrulline, threonine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, valine, glycine, and serine in the putamen, whereas we failed to detect alterations in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). In PD patients, caudate-putamen (CPu) analysis demonstrated consistent serine upregulation across Braak LB stages 3-4 and 6, with stage 6 specifically showing additional proline increases and phosphoethanolamine decreases. Notably, serine was the sole amino acid significantly altered in both the putamen of MPTP-intoxicated monkeys and the CPu of PD patients. No significant amino acid alterations were observed in the SFG of PD patients, mirroring the findings in monkeys. In contrast, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient SFG samples showed significant increases in tryptophan, phenylalanine, threonine, tyrosine, and methionine relative to controls. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that cerebral amino acid alterations in PD are region-specific and primarily localized to brain areas receiving nigrostriatal dopaminergic innervation. Moreover, the cortical amino acid profile in AD differs substantially from that in PD, suggesting disease-specific metabolic signatures in distinct neurodegenerative conditions.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

SAC controls the metaphase-to-anaphase transition by inhibiting the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) through the formation of the Mitotic Checkpoint Complex (MCC). A critical step in this process is the recruitment of the Mad1-Mad2 complex to unattached kinetochores. Two pathways are known to mediate this recruitment: the KBB pathway (KNL1-Bub3-Bub1) and the RZZ pathway (Rod-Zw10-Zwilch). Here, we demonstrate that hSpindly plays a central role in controlling the recruitment of the Mad1-Mad2 complex through the RZZ pathway, independently of the KBB pathway. We show that hSpindly is a dynamic protein that oligomerizes at unattached kinetochores. Importantly, we identify a specific residue, threonine 552, as critical for hSpindly's function and mobility. A non-phosphorylatable mutant (T552A) stabilizes hSpindly at kinetochores, impairs SAC signaling, and increases cellular resistance to antimitotic drugs.

In the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena, there is a tight link between cell size and the cytoskeletal assemblies at the cell cortex organized around basal bodies (BBs).

The number of BBs per cell remains remarkably consistent even when the number and lengths of ciliary rows vary. big1-1 mutant cells are large and have elevated numbers of BBs, providing a system to investigate links between BB number and cell size control. We discovered BIG1 encodes a protein with an RRM3 RNA-binding domain similar to the fission yeast meiotic entry gene, mei2. The big1-1 mutation is a predicted null allele. By extending the duration of specific cell cycle stages conducive to new BB assembly, big1-1 promotes cell size increases through BB amplification. In contrast, excess Big1 protein localizes to BBs and drives cells into premature cell division, resulting in small cells with fewer BBs. Thus, Tetrahymena Big1 localizes to BBs and controls cell cycle progression, indicating BBs and Big1 link cell growth to the cell division cycle.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

In miniaturized frogs, sensitivity to changes in ecological factors related to humidity may be particularly critical due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, which makes them more susceptible to desiccation. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the influence of environmental variables on the abundance of calling males of Adelophryne nordestina, a small miniaturized frog with direct development inhabiting the Atlantic Forest leaf litter in northeastern Brazil. We surveyed calling males of A. nordestina over nine months across four transects, each containing 25 survey points, totaling 100 study sites. We employed a Negative Binomial N-Mixture Model to estimate the abundance of calling males and assessed the effect of environmental parameters. Our results indicate that estimated mean detection probability was 0.03, and mean abundance among sites was 85.90. Precipitation, temperature, leaf litter depth, and canopy cover significantly influenced the number of calling males in the study area. We suggest that, as a terrestrial, miniaturized, and direct-developing species, changes in environmental parameters affecting microhabitat humidity impact its reproductive activity.

Mutations in over 30 genes have been linked to MCPH. Nearly a half of the genes identified by these mutations encode proteins involved in centrosome biogenesis or microtubule (MT) dynamics, suggesting a central role for mitotic spindle organization and division plane orientation in disease aetiology. However, it has been suggested that disruptions in spindle positioning alone are not sufficient to lead to microcephaly. Here, we investigate the contribution of the Drosophila orthologs of ASPM/MCPH5 (asp) and CENPJ/MCPH6 (Sas4) to nuclear architecture, chromatin organization, and genome stability. We show that loss of either Sas4 or Asp leads to aberrant microtubule architecture, mislocalization of the LINC complex, and deformation of the nuclear lamina. These defects are accompanied by reduced levels of both lamin and HP1 and impaired centromere clustering in interphase cells. Sas4 and asp mutants also exhibit a global reduction in heterochromatin-associated histone marks (H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me3) and increased levels of the euchromatin-associated mark H3K4me3. Remarkably, treatment with Methylstat, a demethylase inhibitor, reduced nuclear invaginations by partially restoring H3K9me3 levels. Additionally, Sas4 or Asp depletion leads to DNA damage, increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress, and delayed DNA repair. Together, these findings reveal a previously underappreciated role for Asp and Sas4 in preserving nuclear architecture and chromatin integrity, offering new insight into the pathogenesis of MCPH.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), a branch of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, regulates ER membrane properties by degrading lipid metabolic enzymes on demand. However, the ERAD components responsible for sensing membrane properties, as well as the underlying the sensing mechanisms, remain largely unknown. Using reconstituted systems with purified ERAD components, we demonstrate that membrane composition modulates the ubiquitination cascade at multiple levels. Early in the cascade, we identify the membrane-anchored E2 UBE2J2 as a sensor for lipid packing. In loosely packed membranes, UBE2J2 is largely inactive as its interaction with the membrane impedes ubiquitin loading. Tighter lipid packing induces a conformational switch in UBE2J2, facilitating interaction with E1. The activity of UBE2J2 governs downstream ubiquitin transfer by the E3 ligases RNF145, MARCHF6, and RNF139, targeting both themselves and the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme, squalene monooxygenase (SQLE). Additionally, RNF145 directly senses cholesterol levels, rather than lipid packing, resulting in altered oligomerization and activity. Together, these findings indicate that the ERAD machinery integrates multiple lipid signals and suggest that early signal integration by UBE2J2 amplifies lipid-responsive degradation of metabolic enzymes.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Recently, far-red (FR) radiation has gained attention in the controlled environment agriculture (CEA) science and grower community for its potential to enhance yield through canopy expansion and improved light capture, contributing positively to photosynthesis. This study explores how supplemental FR light promotes lettuce growth and morphology across weekly intervals as well as analyzing photosynthetic parameters, pigment accumulation, and anthocyanin gene expression. Methods: Red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa 'Red Fire') was grown in a commercial plant factory with artificial light for six weeks. 5000K white (W) light was maintained at 300 micromoles per square meter per second, and FR, when supplemented, was added at 100 micromoles per square meter per second in addition to the 300 micromoles per square meter per second of W light. Four lighting treatments were tested under a 16 h photoperiod: (1) W for all 6 weeks (W), (2) 4 weeks of W followed by 2 weeks of supplemental FR (W to W+FR), (3) 4 weeks of FR supplementation followed by 2 weeks of only W (W+FR to W), and (4) W+FR for all 6 weeks (W+FR). Key Results: The shoot dry weight after 6 weeks in W+FR, W+FR to W and W to W+FR was greater than W. Both W+FR and W+FR to W showed a tendency for greater canopy expansion compared to W as well as W to W+FR. There were no significant differences in stomatal conductance among the treatments. On the other hand, in both W and W+FR to W plants, Carbon dioxide assimilation rates were enhanced when FR light was supplemented during measurement, compared to when FR was not provided. Anthocyanin accumulation was greater in both W and W+FR to W, consistent with the expression of key genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, including anthocyanin synthase (ANS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR).

The aptamer AS1411, which targets NCL, is shown to cross the BTB via receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) and selectively recognize GBM cells in an NCL-dependent manner. Beyond its targeting capabilities, AS1411 has been repurposed to recruit the E3 ligase MDM2 in PROTACs, leveraging the intracellular interaction of NCL with MDM2. Utilizing AS1411's multifunctionality in BTB penetration, GBM cell targeting, and MDM2 recruitment, we conjugated AS1411 to VEGFR2 or EGFR ligands to create PROTAC degraders. These constructs induce NCL- and MDM2-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of VEGFR2 or EGFR, demonstrating significant anti-GBM efficacy both in vitro and in vivo, with no toxicity to normal cells.

Somatic genetic aberrations - including fusion genes, aneuploidy, and structural variants - were found to profoundly reshape the 3D genome organization, impacting chromatin compartmentalization (A/B), topologically associating domain (TAD) architecture, and regulatory element positioning. Notably, chromosomal gains were associated with weakened TAD boundaries and widespread gene dysregulation. In addition, our analysis identified over 25,000 chromatin loops anchored at regulatory elements (e.g., enhancer-promoter loops), regulating the expression of more than 10,000 protein-coding genes. Among these, we highlight regulatory loops that drive gene expression differences between BCP ALL subtypes in the absence of concurrent somatic genetic aberrations, including the known driver genes HOXA9, FLT3, TP53, CD44, IKZF1, ERG, and XBP1. Taken together, our study gives unprecedented insights into chromatin organization and gene regulation in the leukemogenesis of BCP ALL.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

However, many scRNA-seq datasets lack ancestral information due to missing early or transient states at the time of sequencing. We introduce CellREST, a bioinformatics tool that reformulates trajectory reconstruction as a phylogenetic inference problem. It infers trees linking cells that are assumed to share a common ancestral expression state. Using maximum likelihood tree inference, CellREST uncovers multiple different aspects of the transcriptomic landscape underlying a single scRNA-seq dataset, which can be visualized and combined into a single-cell network. We showcase CellREST's performance on simulated and experimental scRNA-seq data and recover circular processes as well as cell type converging differentiation scenarios. By introducing and adapting phylogenetic concepts, CellREST provides a framework for interpreting transcriptomic relationships between cells within scRNA-seq data.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Studies of maize aDNA can provide insights into domestication, evolution and gene flow of this important crop plant. During analysis of aDNA samples, it is essential to elucidate the extent of post-mortem damage (PMD) as well as to select optimal tools and read depth criteria for genuine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery. To date, standardized approaches to address these issues are lacking. Using eight archaeological maize samples from publicly available datasets, we compared the performance of two different approaches for solving PMD, Rm5nt and NoChange. We also compared three different analysis tools (GATK, angsd and pileupCaller) and read depth criteria (2X, 5X and 10X) for genuine SNP discovery of aDNA maize samples. The results showed that the Rm5nt approach performed better in processing aDNA. We also found that the angsd tool with a read depth >= 5X is optimal for inferring the closest relative of the aDNA maize samples used in this study. Our study aims to improve the current standardized approach, including optimal approaches, tools and read depth criteria, to improve the accuracy of aDNA data interpretation.

However, there are no clear links between developmental stages, diet, and the mechanical and biochemical properties of mucus. The transition from suckling to weaning is a pivotal stage in the development of the mucus barrier in mammals, with significant implications for the health and morbidity of mammalian infants. Here, using a novel microfluidic device, we investigate the penetration and organizational properties of motile Escherichia coli bacteria at the mucus interface using purified intestinal mucus collected from cohorts of piglets before and after weaning. In weaned piglets, E. coli penetrate more than 100 um into the mucus, a distance greater than the physiological thickness of the mucus layer in vivo. In contrast, for suckling piglets significant bacterial aggregation is observed at the interface, hindering the penetration process. Using the supernatant obtained from purified mucus of suckling piglets, we were able to restore bacterial aggregation in weaned piglet mucus and limit penetration. Interestingly, we also achieved the same result using purified human breast milk immunoglobulin A (IgA), which is known to promote bacterial aggregation. Our results emphasize the importance of mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) specificity in relation to the mother's immunological history, which is primarily transmitted through breast milk and lost during weaning. This also explains why the suckling/weaning transition is critical and why it is necessary to control the full IgA spectrum in response to various commensal bacteria until definite protection is acquired. Studying bacterial penetration in complex fluids using this new in vitro microfluidic device will pave the way for future research and the development of predictive tools for use in medical research trials.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

F.; Khadka, A.; Furlan, B.; Pybus, C.; Whalen, M.; Biboy, J.; Massidda, O.; Vollmer, W.; Boll, J. M.", "abstract": "The Gram-negative cell envelope is a vital interface between the bacterial cell and its environment. It acts as a selective barrier, blocking harmful agents while permitting nutrient uptake. Additionally, it enables environmental sensing and adaptive responses. Structurally, it is composed of the outer membrane, the cytoplasmic (inner) membrane, and the periplasm, which contains the peptidoglycan layer. Peptidoglycan is a conserved polymer that provides structural integrity, allowing the cell to withstand the internal turgor. It consists of glycan strands connected by short peptides, forming a mesh-like structure. In Gram-negative bacteria, the majority of the peptidoglycan subunits contain tetrapeptides. Tetrapeptides are generated through the action of DD-carboxypeptidases (DD-CPases), which cleave the terminal D-alanine from pentapeptides. Gram-negative bacteria encode multiple DD-CPases, but their precise role in maintaining cell shape and structural integrity remain poorly understood. The nosocomial pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii encodes three putative DD-CPases. To investigate the role of these enzymes, we generated single mutants, as well as double mutants in dacC, dacD, and pbpG, which encode the homologs of Escherichia coli DD-CPases PBP5, PBP6b, and the endopeptidase (DD-EPase) PBP7, respectively. We assessed the mutants for changes in cell morphology, growth dynamics, and stress tolerance. Additionally, we analyzed the composition of their peptidoglycan layers to determine the biochemical consequences of their inactivation. Each mutant exhibited distinct alterations in coccobacillary morphology and growth. Peptidoglycan analysis confirmed the enzymes possess DD-CPase activity, and PBP6b also demonstrated endopeptidase activity. Together, our results demonstrate that each peptidoglycan-modifying enzyme contributes uniquely to cell growth and morphology. These findings underscore their non-redundant functions and suggest their specific activities may serve as valuable targets for developing new antimicrobial therapies.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we present PRISM (Phage Recovery and Investigation in Single-droplet Microenvironments), a droplet microfluidics-based, plating-independent platform for the high-throughput isolation, quantification, and characterization of bacteriophages. By encapsulating phage-host interactions in water-in-oil microdroplets at single-phase resolution, and then coupling them with fluorescence-based detection and sorting at million-droplet scale, PRISM enables rapid identification of novel phages, including those that evade detection in conventional assays. We demonstrate PRISM's capabilities across several key applications: (i) recovery of both novel \"plaquing\" and \"non-plaquing\" Salmonella phages from a concentrated environmental sample, where PRISM recovered multiple representatives of a non-plaquing genus completely missed by conventional plating-based approaches; (ii) accurate titering of poor-plaquing phages such as Rhodococcus phage ReqiDocB7, for which PRISM reported a 2-fold higher titer than conventional plaque assays; and (iii) plating-free determination of phage resistance frequency, with PRISM yielding resistance and lysogeny frequencies (e.g., 1 in 4.4 x 10 cells for T7 Escherichia phage resistance and 1 in 21 cells for Escherichia Lambda phage lysogeny) that closely match conventional estimates.

These phosphorylated proteins were enriched in pathways related to translation, carbohydrate metabolism, and the cell cycle, suggesting a broad role for O-phosphorylation in core cellular functions. To define the functional roles of the sole serine/threonine protein kinase (PknB) and phosphatase (PppL) encoded by S. mutans, we analyzed phosphoproteomic and proteomic changes in {Delta}pknB and {Delta}pppL mutants. These mutants exhibited widespread alterations in protein abundance and phosphorylation, revealing overlapping but distinct sets of putative kinase and phosphatase substrates, including DivIVA, MapZ, MltG, and ribosomal proteins. Notably, we discovered that repression of gpsB, a predicted PknB binding partner, causes lethal defects that can be rescued by a suppressor mutation (G98R) in pppL. This mutation restores phosphorylation of DivIVA, suggesting that GpsB regulates the PknB/PppL signaling axis to maintain appropriate phosphorylation of essential targets.

The precise determinants underlying the stability and cleavability of HA remain to be fully understood and have implications for risk assessment of zoonotic influenza A viruses (IAV), viral transmissibility and vaccine production. To address this, we conducted random mutagenesis on early 2009 pandemic H1 HA, followed by selection of acid-stable viruses and detailed profiling of the mutant HAs. This resulted in identification of four mutations, which increase the acid-stability and decrease the fusion-promoting activity of H1 HA, without compromising viral entry and replication in cells. The newly recognized mutations are situated in the globular head, vestigial esterase and membrane-proximal part of H1 HA, in regions involved in the refolding of HA at low pH. A fifth mutation, D346N, is located in the cleavage loop and renders H1 HA0 12-fold resistant to trypsin activation, whereas its cleavage by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is not affected. Along this line, we found that the poor cleavage of H16 HA0, which is unusual in carrying an N346 residue, only applies when it is performed by extracellular proteases. Since H16 HA also exhibits a very low fusion pH, we propose that gull H16N3 virus may carry a much more stable HA than other avian IAVs.

Among these, recent subvariants like JN.1, KP.3.1.1, and LB.1 possess unique antigenic and virological features, underscoring the need for continued surveillance and therapeutic evaluation. As vaccines and commercial monoclonal antibodies show reduced effectiveness against these variants, the role of direct-acting antivirals, such as Nirmatrelvir, targeting conserved viral elements like the main protease inhibitor, becomes increasingly crucial. In this study, we investigated the replication kinetics, host immune responses, and therapeutic susceptibility of three recently circulating Omicron subvariants in the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model, using the SARS-CoV-2 parent WA1/2020 strain as a reference. Omicron subvariants exhibited a marked temporal shift in viral infection kinetics characterized by an early lung viral titer peak (~7-8 Log PFU) at 2 days post-infection (dpi), followed by a decline (1-3 Log PFU) by 4 dpi. Pulmonary cytokine and chemokine responses (GM-CSF, TNF-, IL-1{beta}, IL-6) showed an earlier increase in subvariant-infected mice compared to a gradual response in WA1/2020 infection. Notably, Nirmatrelvir treatment led to significant reduction in lung viral titers in subvariant-infected mice than in WA1/2020, surpassing its efficacy against the parent strain. These findings highlight that Omicron subvariants infection yields a broad dynamic range in viral burden with minimum variability, while retaining a prominent therapeutic response to Nirmatrelvir. This study provides insights to the emerging subvariants pathogenesis and therapeutic responsiveness, reinforcing the importance of continued variant monitoring and the development of effective countermeasures.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

While its structure and function have been extensively investigated, how the stability of individual subunits of SAGA, including KAT2A, is regulated, remains unclear. Here, using a fluorescence-based KAT2A stability reporter, we systematically dissect the molecular dependencies controlling KAT2A protein abundance. We identify the non-enzymatic SAGA CORE module subunits TADA1, TAF5L, and TAF6L as necessary for KAT2A stability, with loss of these subunits disrupting the integrity of SAGA, leading to non-chromatin-bound KAT2A that is degraded by the proteasome, consequently leading to reduced H3K9 acetylation. Proteomic profiling reveals progressive loss of CORE and HAT components upon acute disruption of the SAGA CORE, indicating that an intact CORE is required for the stability of numerous components of SAGA. Finally, a focused CRISPR screen of ubiquitin-proteasome system genes identifies the E3 ligase UBR5, a known regulator of orphan protein degradation, and the deubiquitinase OTUD5, as regulators of KAT2A degradation when the SAGA CORE is perturbed. Together, these findings reveal a dependency of KAT2A protein stability on SAGA CORE integrity and define an orphan quality control mechanism targeting unassembled KAT2A, revealing a potential vulnerability in SAGA-driven malignancies.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

While emerging research suggests some endosymbionts can increase thermal tolerance, their effects on upper lethal and fertility thermal limits has rarely been investigated. Additionally, short-term exposure to sub-lethal high temperatures (heat hardening) can increase insect heat tolerance, but its impact on male fertility is unclear and potential interactions with endosymbionts has not been explored. Here, we investigate whether the endosymbiont Spiroplasma poulsonii and heat hardening influence upper survival and fertility thermal limits in a native widespread host of Spiroplasma (Drosophila hydei) and a novel host (Drosophila birchii), a rainforest-restricted species with low heat tolerance. Heat hardening generally improved survival and fertility following a heat shock. The presence of Spiroplasma increased survival and fertility of D. hydei males following heat-shock, while in D. birchii, it did not enhance survival but protected male fertility after heat-shock and modulated hardening responses at sub-lethal temperatures. While protective effects varied across species, sex, and trait, both Spiroplasma and hardening significantly buffered male fitness loss during heat shock in both host species and halved heat exposure risk under current and predicted climate change in the rainforest restricted D. birchii. These findings highlight that, beyond generating novel phenotypic variation, endosymbionts can interact with plastic responses to heat stress, emphasising the importance of accounting for endosymbiont-mediated effects on thermal tolerance when assessing insect vulnerability to climate change and exploring strategies to manipulate insect thermal tolerance.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Existing methods for inferring transcript abundance from chromatin accessibility fail to prioritize the most relevant peaks and tend to assume positive associations between ATAC peaks and RNA counts. We hypothesize that gene regulation can be modeled as a function of combined positive and negative interactions among peaks and that causal regulatory variants are enriched in the vicinity of the most critical peaks. Results: A machine learning pipeline leveraging single nuclear multiomic transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data is developed to model gene expression as a function of ATAC peak intensity. Multiome data was available for 18 immune cell types from 29 donors, 19 with Crohns disease. The pipeline aggregates results from three machine learning approaches (random forest regression, XGBoost, and Light GBM) as well as linear regression to identify which ATAC peaks contribute to explaining variation among donors and cell types in pseudobulk gene expression. The coefficient of determination with cross-validation was used to identify robust models which typically explain between 5% and 40% of transcript abundance, utilizing on average 47% of the ATAC peaks, representing a significant gain in predictive accuracy. The most important peaks are enriched in GWAS variants for inflammatory bowel disease and the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus, but not for rheumatoid arthritis.

I.; Cherezov, V.; Hofkens, J.; Hendrix, J.; Bo\u0308rsch, M.; Gensch, T.", "abstract": "The functional complexity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) arises from their structural dynamics, which span timescales from nanoseconds to minutes. Single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) enables direct observation of these dynamics in individual diffusing receptors, either freely diffusing in solution, using confocal microscopy, or immobilized on surfaces, using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) camera-based microscopy. However, these modalities are limited to distinct timescales - faster than milliseconds or slower than hundreds of milliseconds, respectively - due to constraints of observation time and camera frame rate, while the slow dynamics observed in immobilized receptors may be perturbed by tethering. To overcome these limitations, we employed smFRET in combination with Anti-Brownian Electrokinetic (ABEL) trapping to extend the observation window of untethered A2A adenosine receptors (A2AAR) embedded in lipid nanodiscs from milliseconds to seconds. This approach enabled us to characterize the conformational heterogeneity in both apo and ligand-bound A2AAR, effectively bridging the gap between fast dynamics measured in freely diffusing receptors and slow dynamics observed in immobilized receptors. Our results, taken together with previous studies, demonstrate that both inactive-like and active-like conformations are populated in apo and ligand-bound A2AAR and dynamically interconvert. Apo and antagonist-bound receptors are predominantly locked in inactive-like or active-like states, exhibiting only slow exchange dynamics on timescales longer than hundreds of milliseconds. In contrast, agonist-binding not only shifts the receptor population toward the active-like state but also accelerates the conformational exchange by nearly three orders of magnitude: from hundreds of milliseconds to sub-millisecond timescales. These results underscore the dual role of agonists in modulating both the equilibrium and dynamics of receptor conformations. Our study highlights the power of ABEL-FRET to probe structural dynamics of GPCRs, offering valuable insights into GPCR conformational landscapes and aiding the development of more effective GPCR- targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

A key aspect of this adaptation is lipid remodeling, which preserves membrane fluidity and integrity under cold stress. Proteins of the chloroplast envelope membranes are increasingly recognized for their role in acclimation to changing environmental conditions. While lipid synthesis occurs at the inner envelope membrane, little is known about specific proteins involved in lipid remodeling during cold acclimation. In this study, we investigate the role of Chloroplast Lipid Remodeling Protein 23 (CLRP23) as a component of the inner chloroplast envelope membrane. Subcellular fractionation combined with protease protection assays provided evidence for its orientation toward the intermembrane space. To explore its function, we analyzed the physiological performance and lipid composition in CLRP23-deficient mutant plants. Under cold stress, we observed significant impairments in photosynthesis and exaggerations in galactolipid response, suggesting CLRP23 is involved in lipid remodeling. In silico docking analyses indicate potential galactolipid interactions. Complementary transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal broader effects on cold-responsive pathways, supporting the view that CLRP23 contributes to the integration of membrane and metabolic responses during acclimation. These findings expand our understanding of protein-mediated processes during cold acclimation.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate genetic relatedness across these three species to identify shared and species-specific genes, including markers of virulence using publicly available genome assemblies. We evaluated phylogenetic and genomic diversity across this clade by sampling all available V. navarrensis and V. cidicii genomes, and a biodiverse curated set of four V. vulnificus ecotypes to ensure representative coverage. Our results indicate that all three species share 2,321 universally conserved genes, many of which are core bacterial functions. Moreover, V. cidicii and V. navarrensis have extensive genetic similarity between them, including average nucleotide identities >95% and 619 shared genes. Despite this similarity, they both remain more phylogenetically distant from V. vulnificus and lack key virulence genes such as rtxA, indicating alternative pathogenic mechanisms.

This research aimed to evaluate whether C. jejuni in the VBNC state should be accounted for in prevention strategies against Campylobacter food poisoning. The VBNC state of C. jejuni strain NCTC11168 was induced at 4{degrees}C under aerobic conditions. A mouse model (C57BL/6, 3-week-old male) was prepared by administering a defined zinc-deficient diet and antibiotics in drinking water. Each mouse was administered C. jejuni with approximately 107 colony-forming units of culturable cells, cells in the VBNC state, or Muller-Hinton broth as a control. In culturable cell-infected mice, an increase in the number of C. jejuni in stool was observed using colony counting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. No culturable cells were present in VBNC cell-infected mice. Clinical signs, weight loss, or significant increase in lipocalin-2 and myeloperoxidase levels, as inflammatory biomarkers, were not observed in culturable cell- or VBNC cell-infected mice. Thus, culturable cells colonized the mouse intestinal tract, whereas cells in the VBNC state could not. In the VBNC state, C. jejuni may not pose a risk of food poisoning. Further investigations on the colonization and pathogenicity of C. jejuni in the VBNC state in the human intestinal tract are required.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

The diphtheria toxin gene (tox) was detected in 89 isolates, the majority of which (n=83; 93.3%) were historical. Population structure comprised two primary phylogenetic lineages, Mitis and Gravis, each containing multiple sublineages. Multi-locus sequence type (MLST) analysis revealed a highly diverse population structure with multiple novel MLST profiles and alleles. When placed within a global phylogenetic framework, Australian isolates were broadly distributed, reflecting substantial genetic diversity. Phenotypic susceptibility testing against eleven antimicrobials revealed that several contemporary isolates were resistant to multiple agents, including penicillin and erythromycin, first-line treatments of Corynebacterium infections. Eight contemporary isolates were multidrug-resistant (resistant to [&ge;] 3 antimicrobial classes), including five with resistance to both penicillin and erythromycin. Genomic analysis identified multiple genes and mutations conferring resistance among contemporary isolates. In contrast, no antimicrobial resistance phenotypes or genotypes were observed in historical isolates. Analysis of historical genomes provides valuable insights into a period of heightened diphtheria activity in Victoria prior to widespread immunisation.

For the oncoprotein MDM2, BindCraft generated 70 unique peptides; 15 were synthesized, and 7 showed specific binding with nanomolar affinities (KD = 65-165 nM). Competition assays confirmed site-specific binding for the intended target site. For another oncology target, WDR5, peptides were designed for the MLL (WIN) and MYC (WBM) sites. Of the peptides tested for each site, no validated hits were found for the WIN site, but six candidates bound the WBM site with sub-micromolar affinity (KD = 219-650 nM).

The herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 protein pUL21 binds PP1 via the TROPPO motif, which lacks sequence similarity to canonical PP1-binding SLiMs. Here, we combine structure prediction, mutagenesis, and biophysical assays to elucidate the molecular basis of this interaction. AlphaFold2-Multimer structural models suggest that the TROPPO motifs of pUL21 and of pORF38, the varicella-zoster virus homologue of pUL21, bind the same hydrophobic groove on PP1 as RVxF and {varphi}{varphi}[xF] motifs, forming an extended {beta}-sheet that bridges PP1 and the N-terminal domain of pUL21 or pORF38. Site-directed mutagenesis of both pUL21 and PP1 confirms key predicted interactions. Competition fluorescence polarisation confirms that pUL21 competes directly with cellular PP1 RvXF motifs for PP1 binding, albeit with lower affinity. Substituting key residues of the pUL21 TROPPO motif to resemble a canonical RVxF sequence increases PP1 binding, suggesting that alphaherpesviruses have evolved suboptimal motifs to fine-tune phosphatase recruitment that may balance viral kinase and phosphatase activities during infection. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of PP1 recruitment by viral proteins and suggest that many other PP1 regulators may possess non-canonical binding motifs and thus remain undiscovered.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}

We then used this genome as reference to conduct comparative intraspecific and interspecific transcriptomic analyses using various accessions of N. caerulescens and the non-accumulating relative Microthlaspi perfoliatum, to identify genes associated with nickel hyperaccumulation. Our results suggest a correlation between nickel hyperaccumulation and a decrease in the expression of genes involved in defense responses and the regulation of membrane trafficking.

Furthermore, our analyses identified frameshift mutations in NcIRT1 associated with the loss of nickel hyperaccumulation in a few accessions. We further showed that the expression of a functional NcIRT1 in roots of the La Calamine accession increases nickel accumulation in shoots. Our results demonstrate that NcIRT1 participate in nickel hyperaccumulation in N. caerulescens.

Existing inference approaches tend to be designed for use with fully-phased datasets, and some rely on model assumptions about demography and recombination rate. Here I describe a simple model-free approach for genealogical inference along the genome from unphased genotype data called Sequential Tree Inference by Collecting Compatible Sites (sticcs). sticcs applies a heuristic algorithm based on the perfect phylogeny principle to reconstruct a local genealogy at each variant site in the genome, using a collecting procedure to import information from other nearby sites. Using simulations, I show that sticcs is accurate for ARG inference, but only when the sample size is small. However, I also describe how it can be applied for the purpose of topology weighting by stacking tree sequences inferred for multiple subsets of the data, removing the sample size restriction. Topology weights estimated in this way from unphased data tend to be more accurate than those computed with full ARGs inferred from perfectly phased data using several popular tools. The methods presented therefore have promise for analysis of relatedness and introgression in non-model species, including polyploids.

Due to its heightened resistance to a broad range of antibiotics, there is great need for new antimicrobial agents that are effective in treating P. aeruginosa infections. One attractive option for exploring new antibiotic targets is the quorum sensing (QS) pathway, as it governs many of the pathogenic behaviors that allow P. aeruginosa to stage and maintain infections. Within the QS pathway, there is a key protein-protein interaction between an enzyme, PqsE, and one of the master QS regulators, RhlR. Although its catalytic function is dispensable for its interaction with RhlR, previous mutagenic work characterizing the active site of PqsE identified active site mutations that induce a conformational change in PqsE, preventing it from forming a complex with RhlR. These active site mutations, when introduced stably into the genome of P. aeruginosa, also lead to a significant decrease in production of a key toxin, pyocyanin, and prevent colonization in the lungs of a murine host. These findings encourage drug discovery efforts to identify small molecules that bind in the active site of PqsE and induce a conformational change similar to the ones induced by particular amino acid substitutions in the active site. Here, we performed a fluorescence polarization screen to identify molecules that bind in the active site of PqsE. We screened a library of FDA-approved drugs, with the intention of potentially repurposing a known molecule for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. Three molecules were identified, two of which showed inhibitory activity that was consistent with a competitive mode of inhibition. One hit molecule, Apomorphine, had a distinctly different inhibitory profile, and is potentially binding outside of the active site to allosterically inhibit enzyme activity of PqsE. All three hit molecules were tested in an in vivo enzyme activity assay, and one of the competitive inhibitors, Vorinostat, was found to inhibit intracellular PqsE. Vorinostat is now being explored as a candidate for synthetic derivatization to inhibit the PqsE-RhlR protein-protein interaction via binding in the PqsE active site.", "date": "2025-07-25", "journal": ""}
