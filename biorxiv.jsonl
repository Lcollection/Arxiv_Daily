Curative advancements rely heavily on targeting the anatomical reservoirs, though determinants of their evolutionary origins through phyloanatomic inference remain ill-supported through current sequencing and sequence analysis strategies. The vast replication-defective genomic landscape that comprises the HIV DNA population is often discarded in these evolutionary endeavors, despite key information regarding competent ancestry that can be gained from captured genomic regions outside the historically used viral envelope gene. Here, we describe the application of small-amplicon, single-cell DNA sequencing to blood and lymph node samples from a treatment-interrupted S[imian]IV-infected animal model and evaluate the contribution of genome coverage and inclusion on phylogenetic resolution and phyloanatomic inference. Findings from this study point to incomplete genomes as a significant source of phylogenetic information on movement of virus between tissue reservoirs during therapy.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Limbs execute diverse actions coordinated by the nervous system through multiple motor programs. The basic architecture of motor neurons that activate muscles which articulate joints for antagonistic flexion and extension movements is conserved from flies to vertebrates. While excitatory premotor circuits are expected to establish sets of leg motor neurons that work together, our study uncovered an instructive role for inhibitory circuits - including their ability to generate rhythmic leg movements. Using electron microscopy data in the Drosophila nerve cord, we categorized ~120 GABAergic inhibitory neurons from the 13A and 13B hemilineages into classes based on similarities in morphology and connectivity. By mapping their connections, we uncovered pathways for inhibiting specific groups of motor neurons, disinhibiting antagonistic counterparts, and inducing alternation between flexion and extension. We tested the function of specific inhibitory neurons through optogenetic activation and silencing, using high resolution quantitative analysis of leg movements during grooming. We combined findings from anatomical and behavioral analyses to construct a computational model that can reproduce major aspects of the observed behavior, demonstrating that these premotor inhibitory circuits can generate rhythmic leg movements.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

A.; Sergi, F.", "abstract": "Human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization is a control paradigm used for tuning the control parameters of human-interacting devices while accounting for variability among individuals. A limitation of state-of-the-art HIL optimization algorithms such as Bayesian Optimization (BO) is that they assume that the relationship between control parameters and user response does not change over time. BO can be modified to account for the dynamics of the user response by implementing time into the kernel function, a method known as Dynamic Bayesian Optimization (DBO). However, it is unknown if DBO outperforms BO when the human response is characterized by models of human motor learning. In this work, we simulated runs of HIL optimization using BO and DBO towards establishing if DBO is a suitable paradigm for HIL optimization in the presence of motor learning. Simulations were conducted assuming either purely time-dependent participant responses, or assuming that responses would arise from state-space models of motor learning capable of describing both adaptation and use-dependent learning behavior. Statistical comparisons indicated that DBO was never inferior to BO, and, after a certain number of iterations, generally outperformed BO in convergence to optimal inputs and outputs. The number of iterations beyond which DBO was superior to BO occurred earlier when the input-output relationship of the simulated responses was more dynamic. Our results suggest that DBO may improve the performance of HIL optimization over BO when a sufficient number of iterations can be evaluated to accurately distinguish between unstructured variability (noise) and learning.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

This approach eliminates the need for manual annotations or preliminary training phases and enables precise quantification of cystic changes over entire kidney sections. Application of this method to sequential histology images across the development timeline of ADPKD in mice demonstrated a notable increase in the proportion of diseased tissue from 8 to 12 weeks and from 12 to 16 weeks, with the cysts appearing progressively lighter. Our workflow not only surpasses the performance of the existing Cystanalyser tool but also offers enhanced flexibility and accuracy in full-image segmentation.

Its role in lysosomal abnormalities observed in AD remains unclear. We conducted a comprehensive study integrating transcriptomic, proteomic, and cell biology approaches to investigate the role of PLD3 in lysosome function in neurons. PLD3 undergoes aberrant ubiquitination in AD brain tissue, leading to altered protein abundance and subcellular location. We assessed the lysosomal proteome in SH-SY5Y cells with PLD3 knockout and found PLD3-/- cells had higher levels of proteins related to lysosomal biogenesis, endocytosis, and calcium signaling. Loss of PLD3 caused an enlargement in neuronal lysosome size, increased endocytic activity and a decline in lysosomal clearance of aggregated human beta-amyloid or alpha-synuclein, despite increased expression level and activity of cathepsin B. PLD3-deficiency increase the level and transcriptional activity of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3 (TFE3), suggesting a role for PLD3 in regulating lysosomal biogenesis.

DEGU distills the predictions of an ensemble of DNNs into a single model, capturing both the average of the ensemble's predictions and the variability across them, with the latter representing epistemic (or model-based) uncertainty. DEGU also includes an optional auxiliary task to estimate aleatoric, or data-based, uncertainty by modeling variability across experimental replicates. By applying DEGU across various functional genomic prediction tasks, we demonstrate that DEGU-trained models inherit the performance benefits of ensembles in a single model, with improved generalization to out-of-distribution sequences and more consistent explanations of cis-regulatory mechanisms through attribution analysis. Moreover, DEGU-trained models provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, with conformal prediction offering coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. Overall, DEGU paves the way for robust and trustworthy applications of deep learning in genomics research.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

In MATLAB, we created grid cell firing patterns for 4500 grid cells. Connection weights between the place and grid cells were learned using machine learning- gradient descent algorithm. The smaller place fields could be learned from grid cells with single spatial firing frequency. But bigger, multiple and irregular place fields could only be learned from grid cells with multiple spatial firing frequencies. Weights learned were normally distributed with a wider spread and multimodal distribution for rooms with uneven, larger or multiple firing fields. Place cells connected to multi-frequency grid cells are fewer. We conclude that each place cell is connected to single modules of grid cells with similar spatial firing frequency. Our results also show that grid cells resolve the space into spatial distance, orientation, and phase offset.

One such pathway is the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway. The TOR kinase exists in two complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). In the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite, TORC1 signaling cell-autonomously promotes the establishment of the larval germline Progenitor Zone (PZ). Here, we show that RICT-1, the sole C. elegans ortholog of the TORC2-specific component Rictor, also promotes expansion of the larval PZ through canonical TORC2 signaling. Unlike the TORC1 components, intestinal rict-1 is both necessary and sufficient for full germline PZ pool establishment. Comparative RNA-seq on staged L4 larvae indicates that intestinal RICT-1 likely acts via vitellogenins. These intestinally produced yolk proteins provision oocytes, but they were not previously known to act in larval germ line development. Genetic analysis supports roles for vit-1 and vit-3 in a linear pathway with rict-1.

Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models facilitate efficient exploration of KGs by learning compact data representations. These models are increasingly applied to biomedical KGs for link prediction, for instance to uncover new therapeutic uses for existing drugs. While numerous KGE models have been developed and benchmarked for link prediction, existing evaluations often overlook the critical issue of data leakage. Data leakage leads the model to learn patterns it would not encounter when deployed in real-world settings, artificially inflating performance metrics and compromising the overall validity of benchmark results. In machine learning, data leakage can arise when (1) there is inadequate separation between training and test sets, (2) the model leverages illegitimate features, or (3) the test set does not accurately reflect real-world inference scenarios. In this study, we implement a systematic procedure to control train-test separation for KGE-based link prediction and demonstrate its impact on models' performance. In addition, through permutation experiments, we investigate the potential use of node degree as an illegitimate predictive feature, finding no evidence of such leveraging. Finally, by evaluating KGE models on a curated dataset of rare disease drug indications, we demonstrate that performance metrics achieved on real-world drug repurposing tasks are substantially worse than those obtained on drug-disease indications sampled from the KG.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

The Bimanual Load-Lifting Task (BLLT) elicits anticipatory inhibition of the elbow flexors in the load-supporting arm during voluntary load-lifting, providing a suitable model to study oscillatory mechanisms of muscle inhibition. We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in adult participants performing the BLLT. Optimal postural stabilization occurred when Biceps brachii inhibition preceded unloading by ~30ms. Stronger muscle inhibition in this window was associated with reduced excitability, indexed by high-gamma (90-130Hz) power, and increased high-beta power in the contralateral Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), with high-gamma power reduction partially mediating the effect of high-beta power on anticipatory inhibition. Furthermore, trials containing beta bursts (22-28Hz) exhibited optimally timed anticipatory inhibition and a concurrent reduction in high-gamma power. Our data indicate that optimal anticipatory inhibition in the load-supporting elbow flexor is achieved through SMA suppression mediated by inhibitory beta bursts. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence that beta bursts can exert direct inhibitory control over muscle function, while advancing understanding of motor anticipation and informing future clinical and developmental studies.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Using high-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA and ITS markers) across 72 samples, combined with mixed-effects modelling, source-tracking, microbiota assembly mechanisms investigation and network analysis we demonstrate that P. lythri disrupted bacterial community assembly processes, transitioning from deterministic to stochastic dynamics in the bulk soil, aligning with the Anna Karenina Principle.

Recent studies have revealed a collection of cytoplasmic and secretory abundant soluble proteins (CAHSs and SAHSs, respectively) that contribute to the extreme resilience of tardigrades. Using computational tools, I examined 39 CAHSs and 28 SAHSs from three representative tardigrade species. Both protein families possess a conserved central region and two highly variable terminal regions. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that CAHSs and SAHSs have distinct sequences despite functional similarity. Modeling by AlphaFold shows that the central region of CAHSs forms an -helix, whereas that of SAHSs folds into {beta}-barrels. Since dehydration leads to an increase in intracellular protein concentration, I used AlphaFold to simulate CAHS oligomerization and found that they preferably dimerize via their central helix motifs. Examination of CAHS dimers reveals a strong inter-helix interaction and an alternating pattern of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity along the helix bundle. The latter is a common feature found in proteins that interact with lipids. Empirical tests using mammalian cells expressing the representative RvCAHS3 show that CAHSs concentrate on intracellular membranes instead of in proteinaceous condensates during dehydration. Moreover, RvCAHS3 significantly improves cell survival as measured by the stimulation-evoked release of calcium from membrane-bound internal stores like endoplasmic reticulum. Taken together, these results suggest that CAHS dimers form a mesh covering cell membranes and thus protect the integrity as well as function of membrane-bound organelles during anhydrobiosis.

Consequently, many aspects of kinetoplastid biology differ significantly from other eukaryotic model systems, including yeasts, plants, worms, flies and mammals. As in many eukaryotes the T. brucei genome contains repetitive elements at various chromosomal locations including centromere- and telomere-associated repeats and interspersed retrotransposon elements. T. brucei also contains intermediate-sized and mini-chromosomes that harbor abundant 177 bp repeat arrays, and 70 bp repeat elements implicated in Variable Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) gene switching. In many eukaryotes repetitive elements are assembled in specialised chromatin such as heterochromatin, however, apart from centromere- and telomere-associated repeats, little is known about chromatin-associated proteins that decorate these and other repetitive elements in kinetoplastids. Here we utilize affinity selection of synthetic TALE DNA binding proteins designed to target specific repeat elements to identify enriched proteins by proteomics. Validating the approach, a telomere repeat binding TelR-TALE identifies many proteins previously implicated in telomere function. Furthermore, the 70R-TALE designed to bind 70 bp repeats indicates that proteins involved in DNA repair are enriched on these elements that reside adjacent to VSG genes. Interestingly, the 177 bp repeat binding 177R-TALE enriches for many kinetochore proteins suggesting that intermediate-sized and mini- chromosomes assemble kinetochores related in composition to those located on the main megabase chromosomes.

Identification or selection of antibodies possessing suitable binding characteristics is now routine, and de novo computational design models, trained on extensive complementarity-determining region sequence and structural data, are rapidly improving.

However, it remains unclear how these oscillatory inputs interact with neuronal dynamics and what drives this frequency selectivity. Here, we propose that this is achieved by targeting specific brain circuits through frequency-selective network entrainment. Methods: To demonstrate that this type of entrainment can occur in the brain connectome structure, we use a minimal physics-based model of coupled oscillators that preserves only the essential structural connectivity of real brain networks. Using this model, we test how periodic stimulation influences network oscillatory dynamics, identifying sub-networks that synchronize with specific stimulation frequencies. Furthermore, we validate the suitability of the model to reproduce well-known frequency-selective entrainment using visual and auditory periodic stimulation. Results: Our model reproduces selective network entrainment, whereby distinct stimulation frequencies favor the synchrony of different sub-networks. Crucially, entrainment exhibits a physics-predicted inverse relationship with frequency: lower-frequency stimulation favors broader synchrony across the network, while higher-frequency inputs produce spatially confined effects. These patterns emerge purely from network structure and oscillatory physics, independent of biological details. Conclusion: This physics-based approach elucidates the fundamental mechanistic principles governing frequency-selective brain network stimulation. Our minimal model demonstrates that selective entrainment of specific subnetworks can be achieved through frequency selection alone, largely determined by network structure and oscillatory dynamics. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how network architecture determines stimulation selectivity, supporting the development of principled approaches to targeted neuromodulation.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

The d-MPRA employs systematic mutagenesis to resolve the functional architecture of CRMs at nucleotide resolution, thereby nominating critical nucleotides as potential TF binding sites, or for other regulatory roles. We applied these methods to retinal genes that are stably expressed in differentiated cells of the retina, in rod photoreceptors and in subsets of bipolar interneurons, using both in vivo and ex vivo preparations of mouse tissue. LS-MPRA recapitulated some of the known CRMs for these genes?such as the proximal promoter region of Rho--and identified potentially novel CRMs, including those located within neighboring genes. The method was then applied to a gene that is dynamically expressed in subsets of retinal progenitor cells, Olig2, where it identified three distinct CRM regions (Olig2-NR1, NR2, and NR3). D-MPRA and subsequent motif analyses nominated critical TF binding sites within these regions. CUT&RUN experiments confirmed direct binding of these candidates. Moreover, extending LS-MPRA to chick retina and spinal cord demonstrated the applicability of these methods across species and tissues. Together, the integrated LS-MPRA and d-MPRA strategies provide a robust, high-resolution platform for discovery of the cis-regulatory code underlying tissue-specific gene expression. It does not require prior knowledge of potential CRMs, and is quite rapid and straightforward to deploy, using typical molecular biology methods. The fragment size can be scaled to create short CRMs, e.g. for cell type-specific expression within viral vectors. It should enable CRM discovery at a scale and affordability for laboratories wishing to focus on a particular locus or set of loci.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

However, reinforcing the OM-PG connection by overexpressing tethering proteins, either the endogenous Pal or the exogenous Lpp, synchronizes the constriction of both layers.

Here, we dissected TDP-43-driven translational alterations in both in vitro and in vivo TDP-43 models of ALS. Through ribosome and polysome profiling, computational, and biochemical analyses, we observed robust TDP-43-associated translational remodelling at cellular and subcellular resolution. Our findings reveal a conserved mechanism across models, characterized by enhanced ribosome recruitment on polysomes, elongation impairment, axonal downregulation and instability of TDP-43 target mRNAs and redistribution toward non-target transcripts. Notably, TDP-43 dysregulation alters ribosome dynamics and selectively impairs translation of TDP-43 target mRNAs, whilst favouring the translation of other transcripts. This process reflects a compensatory but maladaptive response to TDP-43-induced mRNA destabilization. Together, these data demonstrate that alterations in TDP-43 disrupts neuronal proteostasis through ribosome reorganization and loss of mRNA homeostasis, providing a unifying mechanistic framework for translational imbalance in ALS and revealing early molecular events that may underlie motor neuron vulnerability.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia in vitro, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

However, previous studies mainly focused on the tumor-specific neoantigens derived from genomic mutation and aberrant RNA splicing, limiting the repertoire of targetable neoantigens. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of rRNA methyltransferase METTL5 translationally increases neoantigen production and enhances anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, METTL5-mediated m6A modification at the decoding center of small ribosomal subunit maintains the proper function of ribosome during mRNA translation. METTL5-deficiency decreases translation fidelity and increases production of tumor cell-specific antigens derived from non-canonical translation. Furthermore, we found that Mettl5-depletion increased CD8T cell infiltration density and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity in murine tumor models. Importantly, this immunostimulatory effect strictly depended on intact antigen presentation pathways, suggesting that Mettl5 knockout exerts its effects primarily through neoantigen generation. Together, this study uncovers the intrinsic mechanisms sustaining mRNA translation accuracy, elucidates a novel source of tumor neoantigen generation, and proposes a new strategy to enhance immunotherapy through targeting mRNA translation.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that SALL4, a transcription factor associated with syndromes featuring craniofacial anomalies, plays a critical role in early cranial neural crest (CNCC) specification. Using SALL4-het-KO human iPSCs to model clinical haploinsufficiency, we show that SALL4 directly recruits BAF to CNCC-lineage specific enhancers at the neuroectodermal stage, specifically when neural crest gene expression is induced at the neural plate border. Without functional SALL4, BAF is not loaded at chromatin, leaving CNCC enhancers inaccessible. Consequently, the cells cannot undergo proper CNCC induction and specification due to persistent enhancer repression, despite normal neuroectodermal and neural plate progression. Moreover, by performing SALL4 isoform-specific depletion, we demonstrate that the SALL4A is the isoform essential for CNCC induction and specification, and that SALL4B cannot compensate for SALL4A loss in this developmental process. In summary, our findings reveal SALL4 as essential regulator of BAF-dependent enhancer activation during early stages of neural crest development, providing molecular insights into SALL4-associated craniofacial anomalies.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Although PV interneurons are linked to various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, reliably generating them from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has been extremely challenging. We present a robust, reproducible protocol for generating single-rosette MGE organoids (MGEOs) from hPSCs. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that MGEOs exhibit MGE regional identity and faithfully model the developing human fetal MGE. As MGEOs mature, they generate abundant PV-expressing cortical interneurons, including putative basket and axoaxonic cells, at a scale not previously achieved in vitro. When fused with human cortical organoids (hCOs), these interneurons rapidly migrate into the hCOs, integrate into excitatory networks, and contribute to complex electrophysiological patterns and the emergence of large numbers of fast-spiking neurons. Using this model, we uncover a previously unreported migration deficit of MGE interneurons in a disease model of SLC6A1 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, offering potential insights into the developmental contributions to epileptogenesis. MGEOs thus offer a powerful in vitro approach for probing human MGE-lineage cortical and subcortical GABAergic neuron development, modeling various neuropsychiatric disorders, and advancing cell-based therapies for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

The pathways of central metabolism, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle are necessary for producing non-essential amino acids that are needed for synthesizing matrix proteins for cartilage repair. However, it is currently unknown if and how levels of central metabolites change with applied mechanical stimulation of chondrocytes.

The Hyphomicrobiales (Alphaproteobacteria) are a highly diverse and ecologically important clade known to be key members of the plant microbiome, in particular in association with plant roots, but their diversity remain largely uncharacterized in the phyllosphere. Using a meta-analysis combining metabarcoding, metagenomics and phylogenomics, we explored the worldwide diversity of leaf-associated Hyphomicrobiales. We confirmed Methylobacterium was ubiquitous in the phyllosphere and revealed the dominance of two under-characterized Hyphomicrobiales taxa: Lichenibacterium, a lichen-associated genus previously identified as 1174-901-12 in taxonomic databases, and RH-AL1, an undescribed lineage of bacteria related to Beijerinckiaceae, previously isolated from coal slag. Despite their abundance in the phyllosphere, Lichenibacterium and RH_AL1 could not be properly detected by 16S rRNA gene barcoding, due in part to limitations of taxonomic resolution of the 16S rRNA gene and of representativeness in existing taxonomic databases, underlining limitations of this approach for their accurate identification in the phyllosphere. As for Methylobacterium, a significant proportion of Lichenibacterium and RH-AL1 were also detected in association with lichens and in environments with harsh conditions like exposed surfaces, air and snow, suggesting airborne or waterborne dispersal and high resilience in harsh environments. Overall, our study stresses the need to move toward metagenomics and culturomics to increase the representativeness of leaf-associated bacterial taxa in reference databases, and to improve our understanding of the evolutionary and functional mechanisms underpinning bacteria adaptations to living on plants.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the largest study to date of in utero brain connectivity, analyzing high-quality dMRI data from 198 fetuses between 22 and 37 gestational weeks, from the Developing Human Connectome Project. We employed advanced fetal-specific tools for brain segmentation, parcellation, and tractography. For connection weighting, we relied on the notion of fiber bundle capacity. We reconstructed individual structural connectomes and characterized the developmental trajectories. Graph-theoretical analysis revealed consistent increases in integration and segregation metrics over gestation, alongside stable small-world properties. Bootstrapping confirmed the robustness of nodal and edge-wise developmental patterns, and a sigmoid growth model identified a narrow time window (around 27.5-30.5 weeks) of rapid connectivity strengthening. Furthermore, we proposed a novel method for constructing age-specific connectome templates based on aggregation of individual subject connectomes. Our analysis shows that this approach is superior to spatial alignment and averaging of the data in image space, with the connectome templates preserving individual topology and supporting accurate age prediction.

(Rosaceae), is an iconic and ecologically important member of chaparral and oak woodland communities in the California Floristic Province. Toyon's habitat faces changing wildfire regimes, widening variation in annual rainfall, and competition by invasive introduced species. We used a new modeling pipeline, temporal analysis of reproduction distributed in space (TARDIS) to examine how recent climate trends have shaped habitat suitability for toyon. Methods: As input data for TARDIS, we annotated flowering and fruiting in images from 4,105 observations of toyon contributed to the iNaturalist crowdsourcing platform. From these records we trained Bayesian additive regression tree models relating weather to toyon flowering intensity. We used a trained model to hindcast flowering each year back to 1900, and examined trends in hindcast flowering. For comparison, we also modeled changing habitat suitability using a conventional species distribution model (SDM) relating toyon presence to 30-year climate averages. Key results: Toyon flowering is associated with greater winter precipitation and warmer fall and winter temperatures. Our hindcast predicts that mean flowering intensity has been stable to slightly increasing since 1900, with greater increases in intensity at higher elevations, but also at lower latitudes. Annual variation in flowering intensity has also increased, especially at lower latitudes. Hindcast trends in flowering are positively correlated with changes in SDM-predicted suitability. Conclusions: TARDIS recovers biologically realistic predictors of toyon flowering, and hindcast changes in flowering intensity indicate the species' range remains suitable after 125 years of changing climate. Overall our results indicate toyon populations remain healthy, but may have limited opportunity to migrate northwards as climate change continues.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

PIKfyve is a phosphoinositide kinase responsible for generating two low-abundance lipids: phosphoinositide-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) and phosphoinositide-5-phosphate (PI5P), whose functions remain incompletely understood. Emerging evidence implicates PIKfyve in key cellular processes, including melanosome formation, phagocytosis, endosomal trafficking, lysosomal maintenance, and autophagy. Complete loss of PIKfyve function is embryonically lethal in model organisms. In humans, heterozygous mutations in PIKFYVE are associated with Fleck corneal dystrophy and congenital cataracts. In this study, we investigate the role of PIKfyve in photoreceptors and the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Photoreceptors detect light via the outer segment (OS), a specialized sensory structure composed of stacked membranous discs rich in photopigment. The OS is continuously renewed, and a primary function of the RPE is to phagocytose OS tips. To assess PIKfyve function in the retina and RPE in our zebrafish model, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing and pharmacological inhibition using the specific PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod. Loss of PIKfyve activity leads to RPE expansion characterized by the accumulation of LC3- and LAMP1-positive vacuoles, along with defects in phagosome degradation and minor changes to melanosome biogenesis. Photoreceptors deprived of PIKfyve function develop a single large vacuole in the inner segment, while the OS remains mostly intact over the timespan analyzed. Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings revealed complete visual impairment in pikfyve crispant larvae, and significantly reduced visual function in larvae treated with apilimod post embryogenesis.

Mechanotransduction feedback loops convert mechanical forces into gene-expression changes that, in turn, regulate cell behaviors such as growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. How these loops are coupled to developmental programs to ensure robust morphogenetic outcomes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Yap-dependent mechanotransduction establishes a self-limiting positive feedback loop that drives the successful formation of semicircular canals in zebrafish. These canals form through reproducible steps of bud initiation, extension, and fusion within the otic epithelium. Local swelling of a hyaluronan-rich ECM initiates bud formation. We demonstrate that this ECM expansion activates Yap in a spatially patterned manner within the bud. Activated Yap induces its target, ccn1l1, which drives further ECM production, establishing a positive feedback loop. The ensuing rapid ECM expansion sustains bud extension. Graded perturbations to the mechanotransduction loop reduced extension, with bud fusion remaining robust at lower levels of disruption but blocked at the highest dose. Critically, the loop contains its own termination mechanism: when buds fuse, the PKA-CREB signaling is activated by the adhesion GPCR Gpr126 to suppress ccn1l1, preventing overgrowth. These findings reveal how mechanotransduction-driven positive feedback loops can be coupled to their own termination, providing developmental control through the integration of mechanical forces with transcriptional responses and morphogenetic outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

In Arabidopsis thaliana, PLANT PEPTIDE CONTAINING SULFATED TYROSINE (PSY) peptides and their receptors (PSYRs) mediate growth-stress trade-offs, yet the transcriptional regulation of these genes remains poorly understood. Here, we mapped transcription factor (TF)-promoter interactions for nine PSY and three PSYR genes by combining high-throughput enhanced yeast one-hybrid screening with DNA Affinity Purification sequencing (DAP-seq) data, uncovering 1,207 interactions that reveal both shared and gene-specific regulatory relationships. Functional analysis of 25 TF mutants identified 12 regulators that significantly influence shoot and root growth, most acting as repressors. Of these, CYTOKININ RESPONSE FACTOR 10 (CRF10) emerged as a strong growth inhibitor. We identified a CRF10-binding motif in the PSYR3 promoter using DAP-seq data and validated it using eY1H. Guided by these insights, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated promoter editing to delete a small region encompassing or flanking a functional TF-binding site (TFBS). Removal of this motif, or of its surrounding region, reduced PSYR3 expression and enhanced root growth, yielding variants that retained root length comparable to the crf10 mutant. Together, our results define the global TF-promoter interaction network of the PSYR/PSY pathway and identify CRF10 as a key transcriptional regulator of PSYR3-mediated signaling. More broadly, our work demonstrates that targeting cis-regulatory regions can modulate gene expression and associated growth traits, suggesting a TFBS-focused strategy to influence plant growth patterns.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

P.; Dennis, M.", "abstract": "Human-specific segmental duplications (HSDs) contain millions of base pairs of sequence unique to the human genome, including genes that shape neurodevelopment. Despite their young age (<6 million years), HSD genes exhibit widespread regulatory divergence, with paralog-specific expression patterns documented across a variety of tissues and cell types. Using long-read expression and epigenomic data, we show that human-specific paralogs tend to have lower activity than the shared, ancestral ones. To systematically characterize the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) within HSDs and understand patterns of regulatory change in recently evolved gene families, we conducted a massively parallel reporter assay of 7,160 human duplicated and chimpanzee orthologous sequences in lymphoblastoid (GM12878) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines. A large proportion (14-24%) of sequences exhibited differential activity relative to the chimpanzee ortholog (or between human paralogs), mostly with small fold-differences. Combining measured activity levels across all assayed sequences, predicted differences in cis-regulatory activity correlated with mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y. Differentially active CREs were validated for CHRFAM7A, HYDIN2, and SRGAP2C that may contribute to paralog-specific expression patterns and thereby to human-specific traits. While we find some changes in CRE activity shared between duplicate paralogs likely driving regulatory divergence in gene expression, consideration of non-shared adjacent sequences to duplications suggests a larger role for altered genome positional effects. In all, this work suggests that functional divergence of duplicated CREs contributes moderately to regulatory divergence of HSD genes and uncovers enhancers that are candidate drivers of human-specific regulatory patterns.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a biallelic loss-of-function MCUR1 variant (c.802C>T; p.R268X) in a patient with a progressive neurological phenotype. This mutation leads to loss of MCUR1 protein and exerts a dominant-negative effect on its paralog, CCDC90B.

Deletion of MCUR1 and CCDC90B in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which lacks the MCUC, impairs lipid and amino acid metabolism and causes nitrogen source-dependent growth defects that are rescued by expression of human MCUR1. Patient serum metabolomics confirms an imbalance in the amino acid pool, while MCUR1 deficiency in patient-derived skin fibroblasts upregulates autophagy, perturbs non-essential amino acid metabolism, and limits biosynthetic capacity, resulting in delayed proliferation and migration.

D. santomea males distinguish conspecific sexes but court both vigorously and seldom attack. Elevated intermale courtship stems from at least three evolutionarily derived pheromonal changes. In males, the sexually monomorphic cuticular pheromone 7-tricosene promotes rather than inhibits courtship and the courtship-inhibiting olfactory pheromone cVA is reduced 84-92% compared to close relatives. The third switch is in D. santomea females, where cVA suppresses rather than promotes sexual receptivity. Female cVA aversion and male cVA reduction may have co-evolved to maintain efficient intraspecific mating but prevent hybridization with the sympatric sibling species D. yakuba. High intermale courtship and low cVA also co-occur and appear selectively derived in a distant monomorphic species D. persimilis, implying pheromonal and social behavioral convergence.

This quiescence is typically assumed to be the default state of stress-inducible genes, maintained without active cellular intervention. Using a forward genetic screen for constitutive activation of inducible heat shock proteins (iHSPs) in C. elegans, we found that the multi-zinc-finger protein ZNF-236 is essential for maintaining iHSP quiescence under normal conditions. Loss of znf-236 causes constitutive iHSP expression throughout the genome, affecting both endogenous iHSP loci and iHSP sequences inserted at dispersed chromosomal sites. However, the effect is also chromosomal context-dependent: robustly heat-responsive iHSP transgenes integrated into the ribosomal DNA locus or extrachromosomal arrays are unaffected by znf-236 loss. This differential responsiveness suggests iHSP induction in znf-236 mutants results from a shift in genome organization, rather than from accumulated denatured proteins or engagement of the canonical heat shock response. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a potent ZNF-236-dependent default silencing mechanism that broadly restrains iHSP genes across the genome and helps ensure appropriate iHSP quiescence even at ectopic chromosomal locations. Contrary to prior assumptions, this suggests that quiescence of stress-inducible genes reflects an actively maintained genomic state rather than merely a passive absence of expression.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

It has been hypothesized that selection for antigenic variants may occur during the establishment of a new infection, rather than over time in a single host. Here, we leveraged a large household cohort study to assess whether selection was detectable between acutely infected hosts. We investigated influenza A virus evolution using specimens from 384 children and household contacts with RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A infection, representing infections with A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses from 2017-19. In agreement with prior studies, we found that acute infections involved weak purifying selection across the viral genome. In addition, we identified 40 transmission events occurring in 31 households. During transmission, evolution between hosts was characterized by tight transmission bottlenecks and weak purifying selection. We found variability in the strength and direction of selection on antigenic regions of HA, but no clear evidence for selection of antigenic variants during transmission. Together, our results indicate that stochastic processes and weak natural selection dominate most acute influenza A virus infections and transmission events, and that selection of antigenic variants during transmission between acutely infected hosts is likely to be exceedingly rare.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

However, the analysis of these long reads to identify actionable genotypes remains challenging and typically requires customization depending on the target gene. Here, we describe a generic algorithm to accurately reconstruct allele sequences derived from long-reads of genomic-amplicon origin. Rather than calling variants directly from these long-reads, our method takes a \"sequence-first\" approach, performing an unbiased reconstruction of the underlying amplicon sequences to generate high-confidence reconstructed allele sequences. This is done without user input of the expected target gene, allowing for any source amplicon to be reconstructed. These high-confidence reconstructed allele sequences are then compared to the genomic reference sequence of the gene to infer the specific diplotype present in the sample. This approach is agnostic towards the number of genes and alleles present and readily detects novel variants. We demonstrate our approach using three independent data sets for CYP2D6, a diverse and complex gene with over 175 known alleles of clinical significance affecting drug dosing. We show how our approach can accurately recover validated CYP2D6 diplotypes from 20 Coriell samples sequenced using different primer sets, on different Oxford Nanopore Technologies flow cell versions, and to different depths.

J.; Kim, B.; Fairhall, A. L.; Buffalo, E. A.", "abstract": "The hippocampus has been shown to support a variety of cognitive functions, ranging from spatial navigation1,2 to anxiety regulation 3 to memory formation4,5, but how its moment-to-moment neuronal activity contributes to cognition remains poorly understood. The activity of single hippocampal neurons is correlated with numerous perceptual features and task variables6-14, raising the question of whether these response properties reflect distinct mechanisms or a single generalized computation. Here, we show that diverse hippocampal responses reflect unified event-driven dynamics in which population activity transitions between discrete ensemble states at behaviorally salient events. Recording from monkeys performing a virtual spatial alternation task, we found that population activity did not evolve smoothly over time but instead transitioned abruptly at each relevant event. These discontinuities segmented activity into distinct ensemble codes, effectively chunking conceptually defined task epochs. Notably, many neuronal responses persisted across visually distinct environments, demonstrating that these dynamics reflect abstract task structure rather than specific sensory features. These results reveal that the hippocampus constructs a temporal scaffold anchored to relevant behavioral events, with each neural state tracking a distinct task phase. This organizational principle may explain the diverse correlates observed across studies: rather than individually encoding task features, hippocampal neurons collectively signal which phase of a behavioral sequence is currently active. Our findings suggest that the hippocampus parses experience into meaningful elements and tracks \"position\" within a learned behavioral structure.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

The endothelium, as the interface between blood and vasculature, shapes disease onset and progression through its response to environmental cues. However, while the genetic component of these diseases has been captured by genome wide association studies (GWAS), which also highlighted a shared immune component, it remains unclear which of these disease loci exerts their effects through endothelial cells. This study identifies, and quantifies, the genetic determinants of endothelial cells molecular traits and their overlap to the common genetic variation component of these diseases.\n\nMethodsWe generated genotype, RNA-sequencing, H3K27ac ChIP-sequencing, ATAC-sequencing, and endothelial cells barrier stimuli response measurements for 100 samples of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for gene expression, transcriptional isoform usage, splice junction usage, chromatin activity and barrier response. We applied statistical colocalisation to identify the overlap between data layers, and to explain molecular QTLs contribution to GWAS disease loci.\n\nResultsWe used molecular QTLs to identify the regulatory features of 8,214 genes, representing 36% of all expressed genes in endothelial cells. We also identified the molecular mechanisms underlying 815 loci across 16 disease GWAS. These represent between 29% and 40% of all loci for each disease, compared to the previous average of 23%. This is due to the choice of a cell type often underrepresented in tissue level data, and the inclusion of isoform, splicing and chromatin activity datasets. Furthermore, we compared the endothelial cells molecular QTLs with similar datasets in monocytes, neutrophils and CD4 T lymphocytes to shed light on the interplay between the endothelial and the immune compartments in these diseases. We identified loci acting through both the endothelial and the immune compartment, mostly with the same directionality of effect, and endothelial specific ones.\n\nConclusionsThis work expands the knowledge of the mechanisms and genes underlying the effect of common genetic variation on non-communicable diseases having endothelial dysfunction as a shared feature.

Mediated by its low-complexity C-terminal domain (CTD), TDP-43 can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form aggregates and fibrils. These phase transitions are associated with pathological TDP-43 mislocalization and cytoplasmic aggregation. What determines whether and when TDP-43 adopts a liquid droplet state or forms solid aggregates, transiently or irreversibly? A full understanding of the underlying biophysical mechanisms will help explain the cellular toxicity of aberrant forms of TDP-43 and similar proteins, such as some of the large family of RNA-binding proteins. In this study, we generated recombinant full-length TDP-43 and maintained soluble working solutions without the need of a solubility tag. By focusing on conditions that tune the electrostatic characteristics, we induced phase transitions among states of soluble TDP-43, solid aggregates, and liquid droplet phases in an expedient and controlled manner. We also obtained soluble working solutions of TDP-CTD and another crucial splicing factor, hnRNPH1, and investigated their phase behaviors as individual proteins and their interactions between each other during phase transitions.

To overcome these barriers, we developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform for targeted mRNA delivery to MM cells in vivo. Through combinatorial screening, we identified C16-O1, a piperazine-based ionizable lipid that enables efficient transfection of both CD138 and CD138- MM subclones.

P.", "abstract": "Mathematical modeling of large-scale genetic and metabolic networks remains an open area of research with profound implications for understanding biochemical signaling systems in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In this work, we extend the biochemical modeling framework based on the Power Law formalism, originally developed by M.A. Savageau to elucidate design principles in small bacterial networks. This formalism captures gene regulation and metabolic fluxes through two fundamental sets of parameters: kinetic parameters and kinetic orders. The kinetic parameters determine the magnitudes of fluxes, while the kinetic orders appearing as exponents in the power-law representation encode the regulatory structure of the system. We propose a mathematical technique to characterize the entire family of systems associated with the space of kinetic orders. We show that this exponent space possesses a well-defined structure in toric geometry and can therefore be modeled using algebraic varieties. To represent large-scale networks, we associate a toric variety with each polynomial equation of the system and then use geometric techniques to coherently combine these varieties into a global structure, or fan. This construction enables a modular and geometrically consistent representation of complex biochemical networks.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Using Dictyostelium discoideum as a model host phagocyte, we show that Mycobacterium marinum rapidly sheds its envelope components, including surface proteins, carbohydrates, and virulence-associated lipids, within minutes of uptake. Shed material is actively trafficking within host endocytic pathways and disseminates to neighboring bystander cells, where it accumulates and triggers several responses. Notably, bystander cells exposed to shed material exhibit a transient delay in G1/S cell cycle progression, an activation of membrane damage-response pathways, and an enhanced resistance to subsequent mycobacterial infection. These phenotypes are recapitulated by infection-free conditioning with purified envelope extracts, demonstrating that superficial components of the envelope alone are sufficient to modulate host cell responses. Moreover, this priming effect is independent of bacterial viability or the Esx-1 secretion systems, underscoring the intrinsic immunomodulatory capacity of the envelope. Interestingly, bacteria that lose their outer layer are more frequently ubiquitinated, suggesting that host-driven stripping exposes molecules that are recognized by cytosolic sensors to mount a cell-autonomous defense. Together, our findings reveal that mycobacterial envelope shedding is a widespread, early event during intracellular infection that impacts both infected and bystander cells. These findings suggest that mycobacterial outermost envelope components can influence host cell physiology and contribute to early innate immune modulation, with implications for understanding the initial determinants of infection outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

However, it is possible that the specific functions of OT depend on different time periods of action. In this study, we aimed to determine whether there are developmental stages during which OT-expressing neurons play a decisive role with long-term consequences. To this end, we chemogenetically inhibited OT-expressing neurons during three critical periods of development (in infants, juveniles, and young adults) in male and female mice, followed by a longitudinal study to assess behaviour and metabolic perturbations. The most pronounced behavioural effects are observed after inhibition during infancy in both sexes. Notably, social memory is consistently impaired in males, regardless of the inactivation period. From a metabolic perspective, in adulthood, an increase in body weight is observed in all cohorts of males but fat mass and adipocyte size increase after inhibition of OT-expressing neurons during juvenile period. In addition, we observed a significant delay in the day of birth and an alteration in feeding behaviour in neonates after inhibiting OT-expressing neurons around the time of birth. Thus, inhibition of OT neurons during three postnatal periods has direct, distinct, and long-lasting consequences on social behaviour and metabolism, depending on the sex and on the timing of inactivation. Our results also demonstrate a role of foetal/neonate oxytocin neurons in the timing of birth and in early feeding behaviour.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

J.; Beker, S.; Molholm, S.", "abstract": "Atypical sensory processing is a core feature of autism, particularly when integration across sensory modalities is required. The neural mechanisms underlying these multisensory differences remain unclear. We recorded high-density EEG while autistic children aged 8-13 (AU; n=40), unaffected siblings of autistic children (SIB; n=26), and non-autistic controls (NA; n=36) performed a simple reaction-time task to auditory (A), visual (V), and audiovisual (AV) stimuli. Analyses targeted event-related potentials (ERPs; P1/N1/P2), alpha-band event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), and long-range theta-band functional connectivity (weighted phase-lag index, wPLI). Across all unisensory measures (ERPs, alpha-ERD, and connectivity), groups did not differ, indicating broadly comparable unisensory processing. By contrast, multisensory integration (MSI; operationalized for ERPs and alpha-ERD as AV - (A+V)) differed across groups: NA children showed significant ERP MSI over parieto-central sites that was absent in AU and SIB; and alpha-ERD MSI was present in all groups but significantly reduced in AU, with SIB showing an intermediate profile. Connectivity analyses revealed that AV theta-band fronto-parieto-occipital coupling was reduced in autistic relative to non-autistic children, consistent with weaker large-scale coordination during multisensory processing. Together, these results point to a multisensory-specific deficit in autism spanning early sensory encoding, posterior alpha-ERD, and fronto-posterior coupling. The convergence of results supports a mechanistic account of disrupted multisensory influences on sensory processing due to reduced multisensory attentional orientation. Intermediate SIB profiles suggest inherited liability for these neural phenotypes. These results help explain well-documented behavioral MSI differences in autism by linking impaired early enhancement with attenuated top-down control of sensory cortex.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Although larger infarcts are associated with higher infection risk, it is unclear whether lesion size directly influences gut barrier integrity or bacterial dissemination. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) proximally or distally to generate large or small infarcts. Seventy two hours post ischemia, infarct volume was measured by MRI, and BT was assessed in mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and lungs. ZO1 and MMP9 expression were used to evaluate intestinal barrier integrity. Peripheral and central inflammation were assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Results: Proximal MCAO produced larger infarcts than distal MCAO. The proportion of animals exhibiting BT was lower in distal MCAO, but this difference was not statistically significant. ZO1 expression did not differ between groups, while MMP9 was increased only in animals with BT, independent of infarct size. BT was associated with more pronounced lymphopenia and enhanced microglial activation and T cell infiltration in the brain. The composition of translocated bacteria was similar across groups. Conclusions: Infarct size alone does not determine IBD or BT, although BT is linked to intestinal and cerebral inflammation.

Periods of resource scarcity, such as during climate change-driven droughts, may force animals to increase their foraging activity to meet energetic demands. However, doing so may increase the thermal risk inherent to the trade-off between foraging and exposure to higher temperatures. We use biologging data (internal body temperature and activity budgets classified via accelerometers) from a population of wild vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum) to quantify this trade-off across varying resource availability (quantified through NDVI) over 2.5 years, including a period of severe drought. We start by linking internal body temperature measurements to external operative temperature to identify a thermal threshold where body temperature reaches a maximum at an external temperature of 33.8 C. We interpret this threshold as the point where birds must prioritise heat dissipation (physiologically and/or behaviourally) to avoid hyperthermia. Relevantly, we find that a larger part of the day exceeds this external \"thermal threshold\" as resources decline. We then show that guineafowl feeding activity positively correlates with resource scarcity, suggesting the birds compensate for diminishing resources by increasing foraging time investment, despite thermal risks. However, the compensatory foraging does not appear to buffer the birds against food shortfalls, as birds still lose weight as resource scarcity increases. Sublethal effects (e.g., body mass loss) of compounding environmental stressors have fitness consequences (e.g., postponement of breeding, as was noted in our population). Our results could point to an evolutionary mismatch; the projected intensification of resource scarcity and higher temperatures under climate change may alter trade-offs in such a way that existing physiological and behavioural responses to cyclical dry seasons are no longer adaptive, in vulturine guineafowl, and in other arid-system organisms more broadly.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Using cholesterol-based STEP as a lead, we show that a single administration of STEP-ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) results in functional genetic rescue with significant improvements across a battery of neurobehavioral domains in the Angelman syndrome (AS) mouse model. No significant off-target events or general toxicity effects are observed. STEP-RNPs are also highly efficient at editing human neurons and cortical brain organoids differentiated from AS patient-derived iPSCs. scRNA-seq analysis confirms functional genetic rescue via reactivation of Ube3a/UBE3A expression in human and mouse STEP-RNP-treated neuronal cells.

However, palaeontology is a challenging field in which to apply machine learning. Datasets may be small or unlabelled, images may be complex and different from standard datasets and palaeontologists may lack specialist training and access to necessary computational resources. We show how these challenges can be addressed by utilising recent developments in self-supervised learning (SSL). Using a frozen DINOv3 feature extractor and a simple linear classifier, with reduced data, we can achieve comparable results to literature benchmarks using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the previous standard, when classifying fossil tracks, pollen, radiolaria, foraminifera and a dataset of diverse fossil images. Additionally, the rich feature vectors generated by the model can be used for few-shot learning, unsupervised clustering and quantification of disparity. Using state-of-the-art self-supervised methods increases accessibility by reducing code, compute and data required. It also maintains accuracy, while increasing reproducibility by reducing parameters and allowing simple future-proof model agnostic pipelines which may become the new standard approach in palaeontology.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Despite imaging techniques and endomyocardial biopsies advancing, there is still inadequate for myocarditis characterization. Some studies have shown that myocarditis is closely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, this study was aimed to identify mitochondrial-related biomarkers and gene regulatory networks in myocarditis and potential therapeutic targets. Methods: We downloaded GSE95368 dataset from GEO to get myocarditis gene expression profiles, then used EdgeR and AI algorithm for bioinformatics analysis of DEGs functions. Established CVB3-induced mouse myocarditis model via intraperitoneal injection, and assessed energy metabolism differences using targeted metabolomics. CVB3 stimulus induced myocarditis in H9C2 cells. We assessed mitochondrial dysfunction (ATP, MMP) with commercial kits, MAPK8 release via ELISA, and MAPK8, p-PI3K, p-AKT levels by western blot. Furthermore, a total of 8 patients primarily diagnosed with myocarditis were enrolled, and levels of MAPK8 and CK in serum were detected. SP600125, an inhibitor of MAPK8, was administrated to CVB3-infected mice to study its potential protective effect in viral myocarditis. Results: We obtained 77 DEGs enriched in myocarditis. Analysis yielded 11 modules, MEpurple module genes linked to myocarditis progression were identified via WGCNA. MAPK8, NAMPT and ALB are associated with mitochondrial function. CVB3-infected mice showed cardiac inflammation and high MAPK8 expression in serum or heart tissues.The target metabolism results indicated altered central carbon metabolism distinguished CVB3 group from control, with higher D-Glucose-1-phosphate and D-Glucose-6-phosphate and lower L-Cystine, dCMP, IMP and Xylulose-5-phosphate levels. CVB3 treatment caused mitochondrial dysfunction in H9C2 cells (decreased ATP, MMP), and increased MAPK expression. Western blot showed MAPK8 consolidated the levels of p-PI3K and p-AKT. CK activity was notably higher in myocarditis patients than healthy individuals. MAPK8 levels in myocarditis patients serum also exceeded those in healthy individuals. Pearson analysis indicated that MAPK8 and CK may contribute to myocarditis progression via distinct mechanisms. In CVB3-infected mouse model with SP600125 treatment, cardiac inflammation and MAPK8, p-PI3k, p-AKT expression were reduced, confirming MAPK8s crucial role in viral myocarditis.

However, the effectiveness of ECT in treating MDD patients varies. Here we identified gut microbiota as a potential restraining factor of ECT efficacy. By using a 5-day electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in depression mouse model of chronic restraint stress (CRS), it was observed that the antidepressant effect of ECS was suppressed after antibiotics (ABX)-induced microbiota dysbiosis, which also resulted in elevated c-Fos expression of CRH neurons in paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) and increased serum corticosterone levels after ECS. Metabolomic analysis revealed the critical involvement of microbiota associated purine metabolism, and the supplement of gut microbiota-derived adenosine was able to recover the antidepressant effect of ECS in ABX-treated CRS mouse model.

Here, we analyzed Y' elements across 54 S. cerevisiae strains using high-quality telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies. We detected 893 high-confidence Y' elements, which we classified into 12 major clusters, revealing a broader structural diversity than previously described, including canonical short (~5.2 kb) and long (~6.7 kb) elements, intermediate-size classes (mid1 and mid2), and a novel family containing CA-rich repeats. Sequence analyses showed that open reading frames (ORFs), including those encoding the putative Y'-Help1 helicase, are highly conserved within clusters, suggesting selective maintenance of functional sequences. The distribution of Y' elements varied widely across strains and chromosome extremities, with some strains lacking Y' entirely and others, such as the clinical ADI isolate, carrying up to 149 copies. Interstitial telomeric sequences (ITS) were variably associated with Y' elements and tandem Y' repeats, potentially facilitating recombination and amplification. Analysis of telomere length data further revealed that the presence of long Y' elements, but not Y' elements from other clusters, at the subtelomere is correlated with shorter telomeres at the same chromosome end. Our results provide the most comprehensive catalog of S. cerevisiae Y' elements to date, uncovering unexpected structural and sequence diversity, and a potentially functional role in telomere length regulation.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Contralateral S1 showed robust activation, and ipsilateral S1 showed suppression during unilateral stimulation; however, linear mixed-effects analyses revealed reliable frequency-dependent modulation in ipsilateral S1, which was absent when no comparison was required. Multivariate representational analyses further demonstrated that fMRI activity patterns representing the differences between successive stimuli were strengthened under memory demands, particularly within ipsilateral S1 and parietal cortices. Furthermore, the representational separability predicted individual discrimination accuracy. The exclusive representation in the ipsilateral S1 was not hand-specific; that is, the results were consistent for both hands, indicating a bilateral and symmetric encoding scheme. These surprising findings demonstrate that the ipsilateral, not contralateral, S1 contributes to tactile discrimination, challenging classic contralateral models of somatosensory processing.

The blood expression levels of some of these host proteins are correlated with HIV load, suggesting that interindividual differences in the spontaneous control of HIV infection might lead to the identification of novel HIV restriction factors.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, lin-28 is an integral component of the heterochronic (developmental timing) gene regulatory cascade. Loss-of-function mutations in lin-28 result in precocious cell fate determination during larval development. Previous studies showed that the proper progression of stage specific cell fates during larval development depends on the progressive downregulation of LIN-28, which is negatively regulated by the lin-4 microRNA through complementary sequences located in the lin-28 3' UTR. In this study, we employ CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the endogenous lin-28 locus to demonstrate that the robust developmental downregulation of LIN-28 involves contributions from multiple inputs. These include a convergent action of the let-7 family and lin-4 microRNAs via adjacent complementary sites in the lin-28 3' UTR, in conjunction with the previously described post-translational inhibition of LIN-28 by the lep-5 long non-coding RNA, which all together account for virtually the entirety of LIN-28 repression. Furthermore, through the systematic testing of a series of truncations of the lin-28 3' UTR, we identify three positive regulatory regions that enhance LIN-28 expression, thereby counterbalancing the negative effects of the let-7 and lin-4 microRNAs and the lep-5 long non-coding RNA.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Insect have attracted much interest, and a rich ecosystem of computational models exists for insect locomotion. However, while active control mechanisms have been extensively studied, obtaining accurate and useful models remains challenging due to limited understanding of how detailed anatomical constraints and passive biomechanical properties shape movement. To address this, we developed anatomically accurate 3D models of the adult desert locust and mole cricket, two orthopteran insects that share a basic body plan but exhibit strikingly different morphologies linked to their habitats and specialized locomotor behaviors --- jumping in locusts versus subterranean digging in mole crickets. We fine-tuned these models using precise morphometric measurements for each major body segment. Furthermore, we quantified passive joint dynamics through high-speed videography of anesthetized locust, revealing a two-phase return motion and history-dependent resting angles. By integrating these biologically grounded constraints into physical simulations, we significantly narrowed the parameter space, resulting in more realistic simulations. Our approach provides new tools for predicting biologically relevant, yet experimentally challenging variables, such as joint torques and contact forces, which contribute directly to the understanding of the underlying biological phenomena.

Differences in parental chromosome number can present barriers to hybrid formation by disrupting meiotic stability, but the extent to which biological and ecological factors influence the chromosomal architecture of hybrids remains poorly quantified, especially in monocots. This study aims to investigate how chromosome number divergence interacts with biological and ecological factors to shape hybrid formation in monocots, using a novel quantitative metric, the Ploidy Deviation Index (PDI), to standardize comparisons of hybrid cytogenetic architecture. Material and methods: We developed and applied the PDI, a continuous index quantifying chromosome-number deviation between a hybrid and its two parents, across approximately 200 hybrid cases with documented parental karyotypes. Hybrids were categorized as homoploid, uniparentally homoploid, intermediate, or polyploid based on their PDI values. We analyzed the distribution of PDI scores in relation to type of hybrid origin (natural vs. artificial), growth habit, size of the genus (a proxy for richness), and range of chromosome number within a genus (proxy for diversity). Comparisons across categories employed Anderson-Darling k-sample tests, multinomial logistic regression, and Mann-Whitney U tests to determine significance. Key results: Homoploid hybrids were found to be the most frequent. We found no significant difference in PDI distributions between natural and artificial hybrids. Significant variation in PDI distributions was found among growth habits, with aquatic hybrids more likely to be homoploid and geophytic hybrids showing higher proportions of polyploidy. Intermediate hybrids were common in larger genera with broader chromosome-number ranges, whereas polyploid hybrids showed the highest PDI values in large and karyotypically diverse genera. Conclusion: These results challenge long-held assumptions that polyploidy dominates hybrid formation and reveal that homoploid and intermediate chromosomal configurations are common in monocots.

M.", "abstract": "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease marked by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and formation of misfolded protein aggregates. A growing body of research has implicated glial cell dysfunction in PD etiology, including the concentration of activated glial cells around protein aggregates in post-mortem tissue. Disruptions in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response functions of the microglia and astrocytes is believed to contribute towards neurons being lost as the disease progresses. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To shed light on the role of inflammation in PD, this study analyses two public single nuclear RNA sequencing datasets of the SNpc from patient and control postmortem brain to identify altered molecular pathways in PD-associated microglia and astrocytes. Results: The results show that both cell types have a significant upregulation in heat shock binding and misfolded protein response pathways, likely in response to the accumulation of protein aggregates. Microglia annotated with the MKI67 marker gene show a decreased expression in PD patient derived tissue. Markers associated with activated/reactivated states in astrocytes and microglia are upregulated in PD samples. Notably, expression of genes associated with resting state microglia and non-inflammatory reactive state microglia are downregulated in PD microglia, including P2RY12, CSF1R, CSF2RA, CSF3R, and TGFBR1. Concurrently, genes associated with activated microglial states such as HSP90AB1 and GPNMB are upregulated. Among the top downregulated functions, genes associated with ion channel functions are downregulated in both astrocytes and microglia. Conclusions: Taken together, the findings imply that astrocytes and microglia respond to protein misfolding pathology in PD by upregulating chaperone protein folding functions. Additionally, the profile of upregulated genes implies that pathways responding to oxidative stress are also activated. The downregulation of inflammation-associated genes in PD microglia paired with the upregulation of misfolding protein response pathways, suggests a switch from immune receptor functions to protein aggregate clearance by the end of disease stages. Finally, GPNMB emerged as a potential target for therapeutic intervention, as the one primary non-HSP gene that is significantly increased in PD-associated microglia.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Despite the extensive amount of information available, the complete process of voltage activation of Kv channels -- through which a conformational change mediated by voltage-sensor domains (VSD) opens the intracellular gate in response to the depolarization of the membrane potential -- has not been fully elucidated. To understand this process, we study the voltage-gated Shaker channel and focus on the ILT mutant (V369I, I372L, S376T) known to display a long-lived closed intermediate state during the activation process. Single particle CryoEM of the ILT mutant reveals a novel conformation of Shaker in which the intracellular gate formed by the S5-S6 helices is in a closed state and the S4 helix in the VSD is in an intermediate state shifted down by ~5 angstroms relative to its position in the fully activated open channel. Additional conformations of the channel generated by Alphafold2 and molecular dynamics simulations are used to map the sequence of intermediate states along the voltage activation process, revealing the interactions between the VSD, the S4-S5 linker, and the S5-S6 intracellular gate. In the final step of activation when the VSD is fully activated while the gate remains closed the key interactions between the S4-S5 linker and the gate are transiently broken and are subsequently reformed once the gate opens in the fully activated state, showing that the electro-mechanical coupling arises from a dynamical shift of equilibrium. These findings provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into how structural rearrangements underlie the voltage activation process in Kv channels, offering broader implications for understanding channelopathies and designing targeted modulators.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have established a role for the Schlemm's canal endothelium in this pressure increase and have shown it to have a unique, lymphatic-like, hybrid phenotype. However, the role of these lymphatic phenotypes in the adult canal remains uncertain. Long-term functional studies have been limited by systemic importance of lymphatic genes and lack of Schlemm's canal-specific animal models. Here, we designed and validated a strategy using 4OH-tamoxifen-loaded nanocarriers to generate targeted, Schlemm's canal specific knockout mice lacking lymphatic phenotypes. Using this system, we selectively deleted Prox1, the master transcription factor governing lymphatic fate. Within four weeks, intraocular pressure significantly increased, and ocular hypertension was maintained for at least 24 weeks. Unlike lymphatic vessels, which degenerate following Prox1 deletion, Schlemm's canal reverted to a less functional vein-like phenotype with no change in size or morphology. These results highlight the utility of nanocarriers for tissue-specific genetic recombination and demonstrate that changes in lymphatic phenotypes alter intraocular pressure, providing new targets for glaucoma therapy. Moreover, as we found that PROX1 was downregulated with age in human Schlemm's canal, these canal-specific conditional Prox1 knockout mice are a valuable new adult-onset model of ocular hypertension that captures key features of age-related human disease.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Notably, WBS patients show reduced social fear and are considered hyper-social, while 7Dup patients suffer from social anxiety and withdrawal. Previous work suggests that the GTF2I gene, one of the genes included in this segment, has a major role in the social symptoms of both syndromes. Here, we combine video and thermal imaging in multiple social behavior tests to screen for behavioral and physiological variables showing variations in mice models with either a duplication (Gtf2i+/dup) or a deletion (Gtf2i+/del) of the gene. Our analyses of social behavior, micturition, and defecation patterns identify several differences between wild-type and mutant littermates, some of which show contrasting variations associated with Gtf2i dosage. Interestingly, thermal imaging revealed that Gtf2i dosage dictates the mice's surface temperature profile during the tests, with Gtf2i(+/dup) males exhibiting higher surface temperature than their wild-type littermates, while Gtf2i(+/del) males and females show the opposite tendency.

Y.", "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extra-cranial solid tumour in children. Although MYCN amplification is typically indicative of a poor prognosis, the expression level of MYCN has a non-monotonic relationship with the clinical outcome. This paper proposes an explanation for this phenomenon, which is called the MYCN enigma in the literature. The p53/MYCN metric, which is a measure of the p53 protein level relative to the MYCN protein level in a NB tumour, is the key concept. Our hypothesis is that the metric has a positive relationship with the outcome of a patient. It is presented as a binary classification system, where the prognosis is favourable when p53/MYCN>3.5. The mathematical model presented in this paper describes the dynamics between MYCN, p53, ARF, and MDM2; their genes; and their mRNA transcripts. Simulations were carried out by solving the model numerically in a series of initial value problems. The results are aligned with a list of clinical and experimental observations. We extracted association rules with the Apriori algorithm and explored the parametric space stochastically. Assuming that MYCN enables biogenesis in NB tumours, our results support the prediction that MYCN amplification shifts the balance towards producing MYCN. When a wild-type tumour is deficient in MYCN, stress responses may restore biogenesis in general and preferentially produce MYCN in a negative feedback loop. Another prediction is that MYCN-amplified tumours, without treatment, require hard-to-attain biosynthetic rates and stress responses to achieve good outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

The absence of biomarkers for early diagnosis prior to the onset of overt corneal phenotypes and the lack of curative treatments rooted in a fundamental understanding of KC biology remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we investigated the role of unresolved oxidative stress in KC pathogenesis. Malondialdehyde (MDA) a lipid peroxidation byproduct that accumulates during oxidative stress was significantly elevated in the tears of KC patients compared to unaffected controls and positively correlated with maximal keratometry (Kmax), a measure of KC severity. Similarly, the secreted antioxidant glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), was significantly increased in patient tears, and strongly correlated with Kmax. In a cell culture model of oxidative stress, KC corneal stromal cells displayed increased apoptosis and suboptimal activation of NRF2, a transcription factor master regulator of antioxidant genes. Conversely, inhibition of NRF2 in donor stromal cells elicited KC-like cellular phenotype, whereas sulforaphane, an NRF2 booster restored antioxidant gene expression and the deposition of cornea-typical collagens. Our study identified cellular antioxidant signaling dysregulations in keratoconus where sulforaphane treatment may be restorative.

Lablab (Lablab purpureus) is a highly versatile, climate-resilient underutilized legume native to Africa and widely, but locally, cultivated in Asia with untapped potential for sustainable agriculture. However, the lack of wild genome resource prevents a comprehensive genome utilization research for this underutilized crop. This paper presents the first chromosome-scale genome of wild lablab with its complete gene annotation and provides comprehensive population genomic analyses of its evolution and domestication by resequencing a panel of wild and domesticated accessions. Results The genome was assembled into a total size of 478.2 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 39.7 Mb, and 96.4% (460.8 Mb) of the scaffolds anchored to 11 pseudochromosomes, the haploid chromosome number of lablab. We demonstrated that domestication was likely in Africa with several subsequent instances of transportation into Asia. Our analyses identified selective sweeps resulting from domestication as well as pseudogenes associated with yield-related traits and stress tolerance, representing candidate genes for further validation and targets for future breeding programs. Conclusions Our genomic resource for wild lablab delineated its domestication history and identified key genes and pseudogenes under selection, bridging the gap between its untapped wild diversity and breeding for improved stress resilience and yield in underutilized legumes.

However, 15-30% of individuals with KS, carry missense variants. To investigate whether missense variants lead to similar phenotypic presentation in mice, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce the KS patient variant R5230H into C57BL/6NTac. Computational and in vitro testing suggests that the R5230H variant does not impair protein stability or loss of enzyme function of KMT2D.

Although the glucocorticoid response is primarily carried out by the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1, a.k.a.

To identify novel factors necessary for the glucocorticoid gene expression response, we used a genome-wide CRISPR screen in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In that screen, we knocked out every gene in the human genome, and measured the effect of expression of the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), a classic glucocorticoid-response gene. We identified two chromatin remodeling proteins, SMARCA2 and BPTF, that are essential for GILZ expression. We then evaluated the genome-wide effects of SMARCA2 and BPTF on glucocorticoid-mediated gene expression. BPTF had a highly specific role in the glucocorticoid response, affecting the expression of only a handful of genes, and having virtually no effect on dexamethasone-induced changes in chromatin accessibility. However, SMARCA2 was necessary for 27% of dexamethasone-induced transcriptional changes (152 genes), and ~7% of dexamethasone-induced changes in chromatin accessibility (586 regions of the genome). Genomic regions with SMARCA2-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility were characterized by high dexamethasone-induced regulatory activity in a massively parallel reporter assay, and dexamethasone-induced increases in transcription factor binding and chromatin states. Taken together, these data suggest that SMARCA2 is critical for chromatin remodeling at a specific set of genomic regions with high regulatory activity, which in turn drive changes in expression for many glucocorticoid-responsive genes.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

I critically evaluated the claim that common species better explain patterns of species richness than rare species, using bird data from the same spatial extent at two markedly different spatial resolutions and a third dataset for a larger spatial extent. I did find situations where common species convey more information about species richness patterns than rare species, such as in sequential correlations of species sets with total species richness. However, \"hotspots\" of species richness tended to be most associated with species occurring with intermediate frequency, rather than the most common (or most rare) species. Furthermore, differences in the degree and sequence of rarity across the three datasets meant that conclusions drawn from species in one dataset did not necessarily hold in the others. Overall, therefore, I found little evidence that common species alone could provide a satisfactory shortcut to understanding biodiversity, particularly given that rare species are often facing the greatest risk of extirpation or extinction. Drawing upon citizen scientists to aid in monitoring and ensuring that unusual or unique ecosystem types and configurations are surveyed may be invaluable in obtaining the thorough understanding of biodiversity needed for successful conservation outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Neurotrophins are critical regulators of neuronal development and have been implicated as therapeutic targets in a range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) signal through the receptor tyrosine kinase family of tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) receptors. These include TrkA responding to canonical ligand NGF, TrkB responding to BDNF or NT-4, and TrkC responding to NT-3. While TrkA and TrkB have been comparatively well studied, the fundamental pharmacological properties of TrkC remain largely unexplored. Here, we developed and utilised real-time bioluminescence- or fluorescence-based resonance energy transfer (BRET or FRET) biosensors to study the real-time spatial and temporal dynamics at 37C to profile Trk receptor dimerisation, trafficking and nuclear ERK signalling in response to neurotrophin stimulation. TrkA and TrkB displayed consistent concentration-dependent dimerisation, trafficking, and signalling. TrkC, on the other hand, exhibited considerable dimerisation but reduced trafficking and ERK signalling relative to TrkA or TrkB. There was also evidence for comparable activation by both canonical and some non-canonical ligands across the Trk family in response to NGF, BDNF, NT-3, or NT-4 across signalling and trafficking assays. The divergence between robust receptor oligomerisation and minimal trafficking suggests TrkC is subject to unique molecular mechanisms distinct from TrkA or TrkB.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

C.; Fino, P. C.", "abstract": "Effective dynamic balance control is necessary to maintain stability, but it is an individual's self-perceived ability that ultimately determines movement selection. Accurate self-estimation of balance ability is therefore essential to ensure that movement choices align with true capability. This study examined individuals' perception of their ability on a clinically standardized Narrowing Beam Walking Task (NBWT) to examine 1) the initial perception of balance ability before attempting the task, and 2) how experience completing the task improves the accuracy of self-perceived balance. Collegiate athletes provided self-estimates of performance at baseline (before any trials with the task), early-training (after completing two trials), and post-training (after a further 8 trials). Actual task performance was quantified using the final 8 trials. At baseline, athletes poorly estimated their ability: individuals with poorer task performance tended to overestimate their ability while higher-performing individuals tended to underestimate their ability. With practice, absolute estimation error significantly decreased, indicating that task-specific exposure facilitated recalibration to bring self-estimates of performance in closer alignment to actual performance. These effects were consistent across all tested sporting disciplines. These findings show that effective balance control and frequent engagement in similar, but unrelated balance tasks, does not facilitate accurate self-perception of performance on the NBWT. Instead, brief task-specific exposure was required to refine balance estimates. These findings have implications for balance testing and rehabilitation that seeks to improve mobility in populations whose misjudgments of balance ability are often associated with negative outcomes, such as falls.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

The cortical origin of this temporal illusion, termed flicker-induced time dilation (FITD), is not yet well understood. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to explore whether the higher-level regions of ventral visual stream contribute to FITD. By using the semantic wavelet-induced frequency tagging (SWIFT) technique, four experimental conditions were created. Luminance and semantic flickers were created to selectively target the lower- and higher-level regions of the visual hierarchy, respectively. A combined luminance and semantic flicker condition was additionally created to probe the effect of simultaneous entrainment of lower- and higher-level visual regions on FITD. Lastly, to account for the single-pixel modulations and ripple-like motions induced by SWIFT, a control scramble condition was included. The phase-clustering analysis (N = 20) confirmed that the control scramble condition did not result in neural entrainment, whereas the flicker conditions showed entrainment whose magnitude and topography were consistent with their respective experimental manipulations. Nonetheless, the behavioral results indicated that the time dilation effect was not modulated by the flickering conditions neither was its magnitude correlated with the size of entrained oscillations. Moreover, the SWIFT scrambles led to a time dilation effect which was comparable to the flickering conditions. We discussed that while our results are not in agreement with neural entrainment account of FITD, they are not in agreement with the processing principles definition of salience either. Based on the putative shared cortical sources of SWIFT scrambles and luminance-modulated flickers, we conjectured that FITD, and motion-induced time dilation may rely on the same mechanism based on activation of motion sensitive regions. Finally, our results indicated that, at least at the presence of steadily activated lower-level visual and/or motion sensitive areas, periodic activation of ventral stream does not contribute to FITD.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation represent key candidates to help explain the long-lasting effect of these drugs, as well as inter-individual variation in vulnerability. Here, we systematically reviewed current knowledge on the role of DNA methylation and the related enzymatic machinery in rodent models of SUD. Using a prospectively registered methodology, 99 articles were prioritized. A first set of studies manipulated the expression or activity of methylation or demethylation pathways. Depending on the brain region or drug considered, SUD-related behavioral and molecular manifestations were bidirectionally modulated, suggesting both pathogenic and protective roles for drug-induced methylomic plasticity. A second set of articles focused on candidate genes. Although significant heterogeneity across experimental models, brain regions or gene targets resulted in an absence of replicated findings, available data nevertheless support the notion that drugs of abuse trigger DNA methylation changes at discrete loci. Third, recent genome-wide studies have started to demonstrate that these drugs recruit widespread reprogramming. Strikingly, most adaptations occur outside promoter regions, highlighting an important challenge toward their functional interpretation.

By delivering an mRNA-LNP encoded membrane-bound immunogen displaying three conserved HIV-1 Envelope (Env) epitopes to knock-in mouse models with B cell receptors (BCRs) of defined affinities, we investigated how epitope-specific competition shapes germinal center (GC) responses. Co-activation of B cells targeting different epitopes did not alter GC kinetics observed in individual activations, but a striking inverse correlation was observed between BCR affinity and GC residence time in either scenario: high-affinity B cells exhibited shorter persistence in GCs, while those with lower affinity to the antigen were maintained. Furthermore, B cells were able to engage in GC reactions at equivalent rates in the presence or absence of clonal lineages binding the same epitope with similar affinities, while higher-affinity clones suppressed lower-affinity counterparts targeting the same epitope. Spatial transcriptomics revealed plasma-like cells within and adjacent to the GC which, together with the detection of early IgG in draining lymph nodes, suggests that local antibody production from these cells may contribute to feedback-driven kinetics. These findings indicate that a self-modulated local antibody feedback loop may act as a \"brake\" on epitope-specific recognition--dampening further affinity enhancement for high-affinity B cells and facilitating epitope spreading by redirecting the response toward alternative epitopes.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

M.; Lin, Q.; Johns, R.", "abstract": "Elevated levels of human resistin (hResistin) have been associated with diverse inflammatory diseases, but the precise mechanisms through which hResistins many inflammatory effects contribute to the progression of these diseases remain poorly understood. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is essential in many of these inflammatory conditions; however, there is an unmet explanation connecting hResistin with the NLRP3 inflammatory pathway. Here we describe a unique role of hResistin and its rodent homolog, resistin-like molecule alpha (RELM) in priming and activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Through qPCR and western blot analysis, we found that hResistin-dependent expression and secretion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in human macrophages primes the expression of NLRP3, pro-capsase-1, pro-interleukin(IL)-1{beta}, and pro-IL-18. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that hResistin binds to Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK), which causes the kinase to autophosphorylate, allowing BTK to phosphorylate NLRP3, leading to its assembly and activation with subsequent cleavage of pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1{beta}, and pro-IL-18, causing initiation of the inflammasome cascade. The hResistin-dependent activation and secretion of IL-1{beta} and IL-18 was critical to the proliferation of human pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. For confirmation in vivo, we studied rodent and human pulmonary hypertension (PH). Chronic hypoxia-induced PH in wild-type and RELM KO mice showed RELM-dependent upregulation of HMGB1, BTK, and NLRP3 in mouse lung and was linked to vascular remodeling pathways. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the majority of NLRP3-expressing cells were macrophages and the colocalization of hResistin, BTK, and NLRP3 in macrophages was increased in PH patients lungs. Our work reveals a novel immune mechanism demonstrating hResistin is essential to the priming and activation of NLRP3. Inhibiting NLRP3 activation by blocking hResistin with a human monoclonal antibody suggests a likely therapeutic pathway for NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

In Drosophila melanogaster, CYP4G1 is highly expressed in the oenocytes and catalyzes the last enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of cuticular hydrocarbons. In contrast, CYP4G15 is expressed in the brain glial cells, but its function is unknown. The Aedes aegypti genome encodes two CYP4Gs: CYP4G36 (ortholog of DmCYP4G1) and CYP4G35 (ortholog of DmCYP4G15). Here, we show that CYP4G35 is highly expressed in mosquito antennae, and the RNAi knockdown of CYP4G35 results in delayed host-seeking. Ae. aegypti CYP4G knockout lines confirmed delayed host-seeking behavior in CYP4G35 knockout females. Proteomics analysis of CYP4G35 knockout females also corroborates the physiological findings and reveals upregulation of proteins related to olfaction and other CYP4Gs, indicating a compensatory response to the absence of CYP4G35. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization were used to localize CYP4G35, demonstrating its expression in the sensilla lymph of the antennae and the tip of the proboscis. CYP4G35 and CYP4G36 fusion proteins with cytochrome P450 reductase demonstrated that, unlike CYP4G36, CYP4G35 lacks an oxidative decarbonylase function.

Patients with pathogenic variants in the FA pathway are predisposed to early-onset, aggressive malignancies, especially leukemia and head and neck, esophageal, and anogenital squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Prior studies have linked endogenous formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in hematopoietic stem cells with bone marrow failure and leukemia in FA-deficient mice. However, the genotoxic aldehydes specific to mucosal keratinocytes, precursors of FA-associated SCCs, remain to be identified. Here, to identify alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) and aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) necessary for protection of keratinocyte genomes from endogenous metabolites, we used a sensitized background of FA-pathway deficiency. We systematically inactivated all highly expressed ADH and ALDHs genes in FANCA-deficient keratinocyte cell lines and identified genes required for their survival. We report that loss of ADH5 or ALDH3-family enzymes in FA pathway-deficient cells has a synthetic lethal effect and induces DNA damage markers, nominating these genes as important defense mechanisms in the detoxification of endogenous aldehydes and prevention of carcinogenesis in keratinocytes. Loss of ADH5 increases formaldehyde levels, while simultaneous loss of four functionally redundant ALDH3 isozymes is predicted to cause accumulation of lipid aldehydes. FA-deficient keratinocytes are more sensitive to treatment with formaldehyde and the lipid aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) compared to FA-competent cells. In addition, the thiol-rich antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) partially rescued the growth of FANCA-/- ADH5-/- cells and lowered the level of endogenous DNA damage.

Hippo pathway components are emerging therapeutic targets in several solid tumours, however, the expression profiles of Hippo coactivators YAP1, TAZ and their transcriptional factors TEADs in gastric cancer peritoneal metastases (GCPMs) and their therapeutic value are unknown. Objective To determine expression status of YAP1, TAZ and TEADs in GCPMs; and to evaluate whether dual targeting of YAP1 and TAZ provides superior antitumour activity compared with inhibition of either coactivator alone. Design Expression of YAP1, TAZ and TEADs was examined in GCPMs by single-cell RNA sequencing and co-immunofluorescent staining. Functional studies using genetic knockout and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibition of YAP1 or TAZ were performed to assess antineoplastic effects in vitro and in vivo. Co-immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were used to characterize YAP1/TAZ interactions with TEADs and AP1 components (JUN and FOSB) and to quantify transcriptional activity. Antitumour efficacy was validated in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and KPLuc2 syngeneic models. Results YAP1, TAZ, and TEADs were highly coexpressed in GCPMs and correlated with poor survival. YAP1 inhibition alone elicited compensatory upregulation of TAZ, while combined inhibition of both coactivators maximally repressed cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. Increased TAZ complexation with TEAD4 and AP1 (c-JUN and FOSB) heterodimer was observed following YAP1 knockdown or pharmacological ASO inhibition. Dual inhibition of YAP1 and TAZ was required to maximally suppress YAP1/TAZ expression and reduce their nuclear accumulation, transactivation of TEAD, and activation of downstream genes.

Here, using spatial transcriptomics and spatial perturbations of two-dimensional intestinal organoids, we show that zonation emerges via spontaneous self-organization in the absence of extrinsic mesenchymal, neural, or vascular inputs. Purely cell-intrinsic models of zonation were eliminated by spatial perturbation experiments, in which we transplanted cells into established monolayers.

Performance was assessed on synthetic networks with known ground truth and on three neuroimaging cohorts spanning development, namely the Human Connectome Project, Washington University 120, and the Baby Connectome Project. We compared strategies for choosing K, including post hoc indices such as silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, C index, modularity, variation of information, Normalized Mutual Information, and zRand, together with a likelihood-based criterion for the Weighted Stochastic Block Model that uses bootstrap confidence intervals for differences in log likelihood between successive values of K. In simulations all methods recovered stable partitions, but the post hoc indices favored incorrect values of K under weak signal and nonassortative mixing. In adult datasets the indices do not yield a unique optimum, whereas the likelihood-based criterion selects a parsimonious range centered near K=11, which is consistent with established sensory and association systems. In infants and toddlers, the same procedure supports a larger K around 15 and reveals developmentally distinct mesoscale architecture, including anterior and posterior subdivisions within default mode and fronto parietal systems.

Skeletal muscle atrophy is prevalent worldwide and is a major detractor from length and quality of life. It is often diagnosed and treated as a single disorder, but the causal stimuli and progression of atrophy vary widely. Malnutrition and disuse are two common causes of muscle atrophy, and despite their prevalence and extensive characterization, there have been no direct comparisons of how these two types of atrophy progress and whether they differentially affect skeletal muscle fiber types. The purpose of this study is to directly compare atrophy from fasting and disuse and provide a transcriptomic resource for future research on both conditions. Methods. We fasted or hindlimb suspended (HS) two cohorts of 12-week-old female C57/bl6 mice. Mice were fasted for up to 72 hours to induce malnutrition atrophy or were hindlimb suspended for 0, 3, 7, 14, or 28 days to induce disuse atrophy. At each timepoint, mice were euthanized and three muscles (tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), and soleus) were weighed and collected for RNA sequencing. Atrophy progression and gene expression changes were compared across muscle fiber types and atrophy stimuli. Results. We found differences in atrophy progression between muscle fiber types based on fiber twitch speed and atrophy stimulus. Fasted mice lost 25% of their body weight and 23% of fast-twitch TA mass with little change in soleus. In contrast, HS mice lost 40% of the slower-twitch soleus but the effect on the TA was negligible. Gene expression varied in response to both atrophy stimuli, but a greater number of genes changed with fasting compared to HS in the EDL and soleus. By muscle type, a greater transcriptional shift occurred in the EDL with fasting while the soleus showed more gene changes during HS. Enrichment analysis of transcriptional changes showed similarities (downregulation in muscle growth pathways) and differences (increased fatty acid metabolism in fasting and increased neuronal activity in HS) between atrophy stimuli. Conclusions. Atrophy progression varies based on stimuli and muscle fiber type. This study provides a large, matched data set where the effects of different atrophic stimuli can be easily and directly compared in multiple fiber types.

K.; Darzacq, X.; Tjian, R.", "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF) expression and dosage regulate developmental cell fate decisions. Increased TF dosage has been predicted to enhance expression of high-affinity target genes but also increase the binding of lower-affinity loci. The relative importance of high- versus lower-affinity TF binding in guiding cell fate decisions remains unclear. To test the roles of TF dosage, we examined the effects of increasing the dosage of MyoD1, the 'master regulator of myogenesis', on skeletal muscle differentiation. Unexpectedly, increased MyoD1 dosage inhibited canonical myogenesis and redirected myoblast differentiation towards forming spontaneously contracting myotubes. This novel phenotype was driven by the MyoD1-dose-dependent upregulation of non-myogenic genes, including cell adhesion genes whose ectopic expression also inhibited classical myogenic differentiation and enabled myotube contraction. Live-cell single-molecule imaging showed that elevated MyoD1 dosage increased total chromatin binding and CUT&RUN profiling demonstrated that this increase occurred via preferential binding to lower-affinity loci. Integration of CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq experiments revealed that increased MyoD1 binding correlated to the upregulation of otherwise unexpressed or lowly expressed genes. These findings suggest that increased MyoD1 dosage induced a selective gene regulatory expansion from high- to lower-affinity cis-regulatory elements, leading to activation of a broader ensemble of target genes, revealing a TF dose-dependent mechanism that can trigger distinct developmental programs.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Here we propose a new mechanism driving cholesterol sidedness: sterols form simple stoichiometric complexes with phospholipids. The model postulates that the phospholipids in the plasma membrane bilayer are fully complexed with cholesterol. The sterol in each leaflet is then the product of the abundance of its phospholipid and its sterol stoichiometry. Notably, lipid affinities are not relevant. Using literature values for the composition, abundance and sterol stoichiometry of the phospholipid in each leaflet, the model predicts that two thirds of the cholesterol in the human erythrocyte membrane bilayer is located in its outer leaflet, an exofacial to endofacial ratio of 2:1. The model also predicts that the cholesterol content of the bilayer as a whole is 0.75 mole/mole phospholipid; this matches literature values. The model suggests, furthermore, that the areas of its two leaflets are about the same. The concordance of prediction with observation validates the model and the values used for the parameters. The sterol in the exofacial leaflet of the plasma membrane of any cell is predicted to exceed that on its contralateral side when its phospholipids have a higher sterol stoichiometry and are fully complexed.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Simulations revealed that small sample size, weak signal strength, and especially extreme feature sparsity limit BiNN performance, and that the model preferentially uses linear over nonlinear signal. Empirically, P-NET performed poorly on sparse germline data, and while adding germline to somatic data did not improve prediction, it improved gene prioritization and model interpretation.

Closed-loop cue delivery during high histaminergic states enhanced memory expression. Brief optogenetic activation or inhibition of these neurons before the cue bidirectionally modulated memory expression, and direct activation of histaminergic terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was sufficient to enhance memory expression.

To address this, we developed a complex labyrinth test that mimics naturalistic foraging and implemented a novel hierarchical probabilistic modeling framework, Cognitive Mapping of Planned Actions with State Spaces (CoMPASS). This framework infers a nested state structure, comprising short-term surveillance and ambulation states (Level 1) and long-term goal-oriented navigational states (Level 2). Using CoMPASS, we show that successful navigation in wild-type mice is marked by increased recruitment of both surveillance and goal-oriented states specifically at decision nodes, revealing how sequential behavioral decisions culminate in long-term goals. In contrast, the humanized AppSAA mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited navigational impairments marked by diminished surveillance during decisions, reduced goal-directed states, and increased navigation stochasticity. Importantly, we show that gamma oscillations in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region involved in spatial navigation planning, encode these CoMPASS behavioral states and their dynamic operating modes linking spatial locations to long-term goals.

Gastric power was consistently higher during NREM than REM sleep and declined across successive cycles, consistent with stage-dependent autonomic modulation of visceral activity. For the first time, we show that the gastric rhythm itself exhibits intrinsic infraslow amplitude modulations (~0.007 Hz), which are selectively amplified during NREM sleep and temporally aligned with infraslow fluctuations in cortical sigma power, strongest during N3 sleep. Event-locked analyses further revealed transient increases in gastric amplitude following cortical slow wave oscillations, particularly when accompanied by sleep spindles. Across nights, variance in gastric infraslow amplitude predicted subjective sleep quality beyond standard polysomnographic and cardiac measures.

Inflammation induced by psychosocial stress is one particularly potent example: previous research suggests that inflammatory profiles may correspond to symptom subgroups rather than traditional diagnostic categories. However, robust identification of transdiagnostic symptoms linked to specific inflammatory profiles remains rare. In this study, we examined the relationship between inflammatory profiles (at baseline and after a stress induction) and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions in females, who show higher prevalence of stress-related disorders such as anxiety and depression. Methods A modest but relatively homogenous healthy female sample, between the ages of 18 and 35, was recruited (N=26). We obtained venous blood samples, at baseline and after a combined physiological and social stress induction, to measure full blood counts, plasma cytokines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs; for cell stimulation and intracellular flow cytometry analysis). Participants completed a battery of psychiatric self-report questions, from which we modelled three transdiagnostic factor scores. Finally, we used Bayesian regressions to evaluate the predictive contribution of transdiagnostic factors to inflammatory markers (at baseline and stress-induced), as well as to the principal components of inflammatory measures (derived from a principal component analysis (PCA) of the inflammatory data). Results We identified specific relationships between inflammatory profiles and transdiagnostic symptom dimensions. Higher scores on a social withdrawal factor were associated with greater baseline neutrophil (95% highest density interval (HDI) = [0.06, 1.32]; BF10 = 2.92) and monocyte counts (95% HDI = [0.29, 1.46]; BF10 = 19.08), whereas higher anxious-depression scores were associated with a lower baseline monocyte count (95% HDI = [-0.96, -0.02]; BF10 = 1.81) and a greater inflammatory response to stress (e.g., change in neutrophil scores from pre- to post stress induction: (95% HDI = [0.18, 2.14]); BF10 = 5.66). We also found evidence for an association between the social withdrawal factor and an immune principal component most strongly weighted by monocytes, basophils, and IL-6 (95% HDI = [-1.14, -0.01]; BF10 = 1.88). Conclusions We find preliminary evidence that different transdiagnostic psychiatric symptom dimensions map onto specific inflammatory profiles, both at baseline and after a stress induction. This represents a proof-of-principle for the use of data-driven and hypothesis-driven approaches to identify and link transdiagnostic factors with inflammatory changes, which may be of use to future studies with larger, clinical populations, or for testing in the context of stratified interventions.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

This dynamic regulation is dependent on a conserved WYL domain repressor, suggesting this is a widespread strategy in bacterial immunity.

While morphogenesis requires Ire1, a transmembrane protein that canonically initiates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) through HAC1 mRNA splicing, the specific mechanisms linking Ire1 to filamentation remain unclear. Using transcriptome analysis, we found that the Ire1-dependent transcriptional response driving morphogenesis is fundamentally distinct from the canonical UPR response to proteotoxic stress, with minimal overlap between programs. Remarkably, morphogenesis occurs without detectable HAC1 splicing, and HAC1 deletion only partially impairs filamentation, unlike complete loss with IRE1 deletion. These findings establish that Ire1 regulates hyphal development through previously uncharacterized HAC1-independent pathways. Our data reveal decreased transcription of secretory proteins in an Ire1-dependent manner, providing compelling evidence that C. albicans possesses regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD) activity, a post-transcriptional mechanism not previously characterized in this pathogen. Additionally, we identify cell wall integrity as a key HAC1-independent mechanism with Ire1, but not Hac1, essential for cell wall stress tolerance and upregulation of cell wall biosynthesis genes during filamentation.

However, sedimentary aDNA research is hindered by low success rates due to poor DNA preservation, the largely opportunistic nature of field sampling, and long delays between sampling and results - meaning that substantial time and effort are often spent on samples that eventually yield little or no aDNA. On-site screening methods could thus be particularly valuable when site access is temporary (e.g., seasonal excavations, salvage operations, or in regions affected by geopolitical instability), where delays or poor preservation can mean missed opportunities to recover optimal samples. Here, we compared three rapid DNA extraction protocols - an Amicon ultrafiltration method, an alkaline lysis approach, and a cellulose paper-binding method - across three sediment types (clay, sand, and soil), benchmarking them against a silica-based protocol optimized for ancient sediments but designed for laboratory rather than field conditions. We found that the Amicon-based method, originally validated on ancient bones and coprolites, and which we modified here to enhance the recovery of very short fragments, recovered from sediments both short synthetic DNA and modern DNA sheared to mimic aDNA, outperforming the other rapid methods. When applied to Pleistocene and Holocene archaeological sediments, this method successfully recovered amplifiable aDNA within approximately three hours. While not a replacement for laboratory extractions, this rapid, portable, non-hazardous approach adds a practical tool to the sedimentary aDNA research toolkit, enabling rapid on-site assessment of aDNA preservation and supporting informed sampling in time-sensitive or logistically constrained excavations.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

The multiple testing burden in these data introduces redundancy and reduces statistical power, contributing to the limited reproducibility often observed in association studies. Moreover, DNAm probes frequently exhibit correlated methylation patterns with neighboring sites, reflecting underlying biological co-regulation and spatial dependence along the genome. Ignoring these spatial correlations can bias parameter and standard error estimates, inflate type I error rates, and obscure biologically meaningful effects. Existing methods for detecting methylation co-regulation and reducing DNAm data dimensions, typically rely on fixed distance or correlation thresholds and arbitrary hyperparameter settings that lack data adaptivity. In this study, we introduce SACOMA (Spatially-Aware Clustering for Co-Methylation Analysis), a flexible, data-driven, and unsupervised framework designed to identify co-methylated regions which are genomic regions where adjacent sites show correlated methylation levels. SACOMA employs spatially constrained hierarchical clustering to group neighboring DNAm sites based on both spatial proximity and methylation similarity. A tunable, data-adaptive mixing parameter allows SACOMA to avoid rigid assumptions and remain robust to hyperparameter choices. Although developed for DNAm array data, SACOMA provides a generalizable framework applicable to any data exhibiting spatial dependence, enabling the identification of spatially correlated features across diverse domains. Through extensive simulations, SACOMA demonstrated superior sensitivity while maintaining effective false-positive control compared to existing methods. In population-level DNAm data analyses, SACOMA successfully identified biologically relevant co-regulated methylation regions with functional roles.

Other studies can delineate morphological domains based on transcriptional similarity, but not spatial functional microniches. We address this major unmet need by developing SpaceTravLR (Spatially perturbing Transcription factors, Ligands and Receptors), a novel interpretable machine learning approach that generalizes across tissues and species, uncovering spatial features linked to functional outcomes, thereby capturing functional microniches with spatial resolution. SpaceTravLR infers how single or combinatorial genetic perturbations rewire signals across the tissue neighborhood, by propagating effects through underlying spatially resolved molecular networks, thereby modeling how perturbations can reshape both the targeted cell and its surrounding neighborhood. SpaceTravLR defines novel spatial microniches across a range of tissues at different scales of organization (niches, neighborhoods and tissues), disease and developmental contexts. SpaceTravLR's perturbation predictions are made solely from spatial omics data and closely align with experimental validation or known outcomes based on mechanistic studies. Critically, our approach enables the generation of mechanistic hypotheses underlying identified niches.

To examine the function of mGluR5, we performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and found that the amplitude of the b-wave, which is primarily a measure of ON-bipolar cell light-driven activity, is reduced in mGluR5 knock-out mice compared to wild type. In the mGluR5-/- retina, we observed weaker mGluR6 immunofluorescence in the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells that could explain the smaller ERG b-wave. To observe the effect of mGluR5 without perturbing mGluR6 expression, wild type mice were injected with MTEP, an allosteric antagonist of mGluR5. MTEP increased the amplitude of the b-wave in response to dim stimuli and caused an inflection in the intensity-response plot for flashes in the mesopic range. In the brain, postsynaptic mGluR5 regulates presynaptic glutamate release via endocanabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Therefore, we tested the effect of the CB1 receptor antagonist, SR1417A, on the ERG and found that the b-wave was affected as by MTEP, including an inflection in the intensity-response.

Recent research has revealed frequent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the brains of patients with GBM, i.e., amyloid beta (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), indicating that GBM and AD may share some unknown environmental risk. Since chronic periodontitis (CP), and specifically Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a keystone bacterial pathogen in CP, have emerged as risk factors for both AD and GBM, we investigated whether P. gingivalis gingipain virulence factors could be identified in GBM tissue samples and whether P. gingivalis infection affects glioma cell behavior. Using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (70 GBM cores from 35 patients; 34 cerebral tissue cores from 17 patients), we quantified the presence of arginine-gingipain B (RgpB) and lysine-gingipain (Kgp) antigens. Both gingipains showed significantly elevated staining in GBM samples compared to controls (**p < .01, ****p < .0001, respectively), with Kgp levels notably higher than RgpB within GBM tissue (****p < .0001).

Objectives: To perform a large-scale genomic analysis of K. pneumoniae isolates and systematically characterize the convergence of AMR and hypervirulence, with a focus on global distribution, clonal structure, and accessory genome functions. Methods: We analyzed 3,443 genomes curated from 25 international studies. Virulence scoring was standardized using a Kleborate-based framework, while AMR genes were identified with ResFinder. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), plasmid replicon typing, and K/O antigen profiling were conducted. Convergence was defined as hvKp (virulence score [&ge;]3) carrying high-priority AMR determinants. Pan-genome-wide association (pan-GWAS) was performed with Roary and Scoary, followed by functional enrichment using ShinyGO. Results: Among hvKp isolates, 59.4% carried carbapenemases, ESBLs, or 16S rRNA methyltransferases, demonstrating widespread convergence. Convergent lineages were dominated by ST231 and ST23, with India and the Middle East identified as geographic hotspots. HvKp isolates carried a higher plasmid replicon burden and were enriched in KL1/KL2 and O1/O2 serotypes. Pan-GWAS revealed hvKp-associated accessory genes linked to envelope stress response, nucleotide metabolism, and membrane transport, highlighting adaptive traits beyond canonical virulence loci. Conclusion: Our findings redefine the hvKp/cKp dichotomy as a continuum shaped by plasmids and selective pressures. The emergence of dual-risk clones has urgent implications for diagnostics, surveillance, and treatment strategies in regions with high AMR prevalence.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

While one model postulates that ceramides form stable channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane that induce cell death through direct release of cytochrome c, an alternative view is that ceramides self-assemble into microdomains that facilitate membrane insertion and oligomerization of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax into cytochrome c-conducting pores. To challenge these models, we here analyzed the influence of ceramides in combination with recombinant Bax on the leakiness of model membranes. We show that ceramides on their own are unable to support membrane passage of even the smallest fluorescence markers. Moreover, we find that ceramides cannot substitute for cardiolipin in facilitating membrane recruitment of Bax and its subsequent assembly into functional pores. Our data argue against a direct role of ceramides in apoptotic pore formation and indicate that the mechanism by which ceramides initiate permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane is independent of ceramide channels or ceramide acting autonomously as translocation platform for Bax.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the contribution of the Bruch's membrane and sclera tissues to the overall structural integrity of the ocular wall. Methods: Twenty-three human globes were subjected to biomechanical testing. A piece of sclera measuring 5 x 5 mm was carefully removed at the nasal region, 2 mm away from the optic nerve head. The intraocular pressure was increased at approximately 1 mmHg/s until Bruch's membrane-uvea-retina-tissue layer (BMUR) ruptured. Next, strips of sclera and Bruch's membrane-choriocapillaris (BMC) complex were isolated from the superior fundus region. Uniaxial tension tests were performed at a strain rate of 0.01/s and sampling rate of 15 Hz. The tangent moduli of the BMC and sclera at 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 strains were compared. Results: The rupture pressure of the BMUR was 98.1 {+/-} 21.4 mmHg. The tangent moduli of the BMC at 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 strains were 2.96 {+/-} 1.44 MPa, 7.68 {+/-} 1.78 MPa and 9.43 {+/-} 2.11 MPa, respectively, and the tangent moduli of the sclera at 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 strains were 1.09 {+/-} 0.80 MPa, 2.72 {+/-} 1.67 MPa and 5.69 {+/-} 3.27 MPa, respectively. Conclusion: The BMUR was able to sustain relatively high IOP before rupturing. The uniaxial tensile tests showed that the BMC tangent moduli were about 3 times of those of the sclera at strains of 0.01 and 0.02. Although the sclera is approximately 47 times thicker, the BMC is still likely to make a significant contribution (3.51% to 7.42% at strain <0.03) to the overall structural strength of the ocular wall.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of small molecules inhibiting growth of various microorganism, including both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and viruses. These peptides are valued for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, achieved through mechanisms such as bacterial membrane disruption or interference with intracellular processes rather than targeting specific proteins, which makes lower propensity to induce resistance. While AMPs have been extensively identified and verified from animal proteomes, reference microbial genomes and host environments, those from extreme environments remain unexplored. Extreme environments, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents, glaciers, the polar regions, plateau or hot springs, are widely distributed globally and exhibit steep environmental gradients, harsh physiochemical conditions and limited nutrient availability. Microbes in such niches evolve unique membrane modification, specialized metabolic pathway and other strategies to cope with the extreme stresses. Natural geographic isolation and competitive pressures driven by extreme environments make extremophiles an ideal reservoir for mining novel antibiotics. Archaea, which possess vast antimicrobial potential through the production of unique compounds such as archaeasins that exhibit activity against a range of drug-resistant bacteria, often dominate these habitats. Although recent studies have employed deep learning models to mine archaeal proteome, the antimicrobial potential of uncultured archaea and other extremophiles on a global scale remains largely untapped. Many computational approaches have been developed for in-silico screening of AMPs. Traditional approaches encode sequences with physicochemical and biochemical properties to encode sequences, whereas some recent methods leverage protein language models (pLMs) to generate diverse representations. These encoding strategies are typically combined with deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or attention-based models, to predict peptide antimicrobial activities. Beyond identification, generative models have been developed to design novel AMPs de novo , and optimization can be achieved through genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing approaches often overlook structural information of peptides and frequently require training complex decision models for virtual evolutions. To overcome the bottleneck of traditional data mining sources and limitations in peptide screening and optimization, here we introduced structure-aware extremophile genome mining for antimicrobial peptides (SEGMA), a deep-learning based framework used to systematically mine all AMPs from extreme environments on the global scale, herein referred to as extremocin. By leveraging computational pipeline, we identified 3,298 extremocins from 60,461 extremophile metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Despite the critical role of nutrient limitation in shaping the size and scope of the biosphere, significant uncertainties persist about which nutrients were globally limiting at various points in Earth history. Here, we use a phylogenomic approach to trace the origin and spread of genes associated with nutrient limitation over time. We show that genes associated with phosphorus limitation emerged relatively early in life's history, whereas genes associated with nitrogen limitation emerged later, closer to the Great Oxidation Event. In terms of iron limitation, we present novel evidence that siderophores, compounds that facilitate iron uptake, may have arisen as early as the Archean.

Motivated by experimental evidence that disruption to Golgi morphology can lead to observable changes in secreted cargo mass distribution, we develop and analyse a mathematical model of polymerisation in a cisterna that combines chemical kinetics, spatial diffusion and adsorption and desorption between lumen and membrane. Exploiting the slender geometry, we derive a non-local nonlinear advection-diffusion equation that predicts secreted cargo mass distribution as a function of cisternal shape.

We find that in the absence of canonical driver mutations, passenger mutations in cancer genes are significantly enriched, exhibit higher predicted pathogenicity, and are associated with aberrant expression, splicing disruption, altered transcription factor binding, and clinical outcomes that resemble those in the presence of driver mutations. The accumulation of passenger mutations in tumor suppressor genes correlates with significantly reduced expression and poorer prognosis, mirroring the functional outcomes of driver mutations.

G.; Lee, J. J.; Zhai, K.; Lee, S.; Chauhan, R.; Hosseini, A.; Nguyen, A. D.; Huising, M. O.", "abstract": "Aims/Hypothesis Pancreatic delta cells secrete somatostatin (SST), which can inhibit both alpha and beta cells of the pancreatic islet. By controlling insulin and glucagon release, delta cells play an important role in maintaining nutrient homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which a single inhibitory hormone inhibits both alpha and beta cells, which are often considered as functional antagonists in the counterregulatory control of blood glucose, has been a physiological riddle. Here, we solve this riddle through assessment of the contributions of alpha and beta cell specific somatostatin receptors to cell intrinsic behaviors and hormone release. Methods Islets from mice constitutively expressing fluorescent sensors reporting on cyclic AMP and Ca2+ in both alpha and beta cells were imaged using stimuli to mimic the post-prandial state of a meal consisting of glucose and amino acids. This approach was coupled with cell specific somatostatin receptor antagonists to identify how somatostatin inhibits alpha and beta cell hormone output through modulation of cAMP and Ca2+ secondary messengers and paracrine interactions. Results Our results support and extend prior observation that somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is the only somatostatin receptor expressed by alpha cells, while somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3) is the only receptor expressed by mouse beta cells. Interestingly, SSTR2 and SSTR3 regulate downstream cAMP and Ca2+ signaling cascades differently within alpha and beta cells of intact islets. Stimulation of somatostatin receptors robustly inhibits cyclic AMP in alpha or beta cells. In contrast, stimulation of SSTR2 inhibits alpha cell Ca2+ with significantly greater potency compared to inhibition of beta cell Ca2+ via SSTR3. Despite the absence of SSTR2 on beta cells, blocking alpha cell SSTR2 during nutrient stimulation resulted in a significant increase in insulin release downstream of local release of glucagon. Conclusions/Interpretation Our observations address the physiological riddle of the delta cell's role during the post-prandial phase where we demonstrate that somatostatin primarily inhibits alpha cell cAMP and Ca2+ via SSTR2, preventing glucagon release. Blocking SSTR2 resulted in an increase in locally released glucagon, which coupled with muted ability for SSTR3 to inhibit beta cell calcium under strong nutrient stimulation, results in potentiation of glucose stimulated insulin secretion from the beta cell. We conclude that the role of delta cells under nutrient stimulation is to modulate the volume of insulin release by tuning the strength of intra-islet paracrine potentiation of insulin secretion by glucagon, mediated via beta cell GLP1R.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Existing circuits, however, often couple amplitude and duration. This prevents independent tuning of key dynamic features. We therefore set out to design a genetic system capable of generating square-wave outputs with externally programmable geometry. To achieve this, we constructed a layered regulatory design that separates production and removal into two independently controlled modules. An activating input turns expression on and builds the reporter. A repressing input stops synthesis and removes existing protein. Together, these actions confine the active window and produce square-wave outputs or pulses on demand. Waveform geometry depends on input dose and timing. Analysis of limiting cases reveals that strong repression compresses dynamic range, and finite degradation capacity restricts decay rate. Enhancing removal capacity alleviates this bottleneck and sharpens the off-transition. Together, this work establishes a general framework for programming gene-expression dynamics with independently tunable amplitude and duration.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that Trio signals in both the presynaptic Hermaphrodite-Specific command Neurons (HSNs) and the postsynaptic egg-laying vulval muscles they innervate to promote egg laying. Here we show that its effector Rho similarly signals both pre- and post-synaptically. Expression of constitutively active Rho-1(G14V) in either the HSNs or vulval muscles increased their Ca2+ activity and stimulated egg laying. Conversely, reducing Rho signaling in the HSNs via expression of Rho-1(T19N) or C3 transferase expression inhibited HSN Ca2+ activity and egg laying. Animals lacking Rho function in HSN still had vulval muscle Ca2+ activity that supported contraction and egg release, although this Ca2+ activity lacked the enhancement associated with HSN neurotransmitter release, suggesting it was largely driven by stretch-dependent feedback.

Endothelial protein C receptor CD201can be used as an alternative marker for mouse and even human HSC. However, whether CD201 expression changes following infectious challenge is unknown. Unlike SCA1, CD201 expression did not change on mouse LK cells in response to LPS in vivo. Long-term competitive transplantations with CD201+, CD201- or SCA1+ LK cells showed that most reconstituting HSCs are within the LK CD201+ population after LPS challenge. However long-term competitive repopulation potential of LK SCA1+ cells from LPS-treated mice was much more severely reduced than that of LK CD201+ cells from the same LPS-treated donors suggesting that the LK SCA1+ population in challenged donors becomes contaminated with CD201- progenitors devoid of long-term repopulation potential. Based on CD201 gating strategy, we re-assessed the effect of LPS on HSC and MPP cycling and mobilization, and their dependency on MY88 and TRIF adaptors.

Genetic, biochemical, and structural analyses reveal novel modes of effector licensing. MBL and /{beta}-hydrolase are zymogens activated by cleavage at two distinct sites, and upon proteolysis, MBL becomes a Zn2+-dependent double-stranded DNA nuclease.

All four modules are fused to diverse sensors to detect a wide range of phage signals, and EACC1-DnaK chaperone fusions suggest a convergence between defense and general stress responses.

We further investigate the roles of proposed mediators of PRC1/2 targeting, including SCML2, BEND3, KDM2b, and TET enzymes, in this context, our findings indicate that neither PRC1 nor PRC2 recruitment at hypomethylated PCH depends on these factors. Additionally, our data suggest that the permissive chromatin environment resulting from DNA hypomethylation is the principal facilitator of Polycomb complex spreading, offering novel insights into the mechanisms governing epigenetic modifier dynamics and interactions during periods of DNA methylation reprogramming.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

A.; Gray, R.; Lovely, C. B.", "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are characterized by a varying set of physical, cognitive, and behavioral disabilities caused by prenatal ethanol exposure, including those to the facial skeleton. Ethanol-sensitive genetic loci contribute to this high degree of variation in FASD, which complicates analyses of facial shape. We have previously shown that we can analyze these changes in facial shape from gene-ethanol interactions in zebrafish. Zebrafish are an ideal model to analyze this variation for several reasons; 1. 70% of genes are orthologs between humans and zebrafish; 2. external fertilization allows researchers to control timing and dosage of ethanol treatments; 3. the structure of their facial skeletal is conserved with vertebrates; 4. translucent larvae enable direct viewing of changes to the craniofacial skeletal structure during development. However, analyzing the shape of the craniofacial skeleton can be difficult to fully assess through simple linear measures, as these do not capture overall changes in shape. In addition, changes in head size can complicate data interpretation. To address this, we undertook a morphometric approach, analyzing overall facial shape through principal component analyses via freeware software, TPSDigs2, MorphoJ, and PAST. The combination of this software allows for pairwise comparison of overall facial morphology. Here, we outline our approach and analysis of facial shape in ethanol-treated zebrafish mutants using these programs to conduct a series of complementary multivariate statistical analyses.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

These mutualisms consist of food provisioning by plants and, their counterpart, plant propagule (seeds) movement by the animals, being crucial for the natural vegetation regeneration in many ecosystems. Yet we are far from understanding which part of this enormous interaction biodiversity is needed for their maintenance. I overview the diversity of interaction modes involved in these mutualisms, the main components of the seed dispersal services, and their functional diversity. I examine how interaction richness covaries with partner species richness at different scales, resulting in variable patterns of species complementarities in terms of seed dispersal effects. The functionality of most generalized plant-frugivore mutualisms relies on complementarity of effects across a high diversity of partners, yet frequently depends on just a distinct subset of them, resulting in high functional redundancy. Two distinct aspects are relevant: 1) variable quantitative effects among species; 2) variable pairwise-interaction outcomes, between the extremes of antagonism and mutualism. Frugivory, occurring at the final stage of each plant reproductive episode, entails a large, cumulative, effect of other biotic interactions occurring at earlier stages (e.g., floral herbivory, pollination, pre-dispersal fruit damage). I examine how plant-frugivore interactions mix- up with the whole biotic interactome of a plant, using the Prunus mahaleb system as a case study. The effects of distinct subsets of frugivores combine with different sets of antagonistic and mutualistic partners in other interactions, yet having a lasting signal on final seed dispersal success.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

However, priority effects across disparate groups of parasitic organisms are poorly understood despite the wide range of taxonomic groups involved. In California oak woodland, we investigated how priority effects between two insect-parasitic fungi (Metarhizium and Beauveria) influenced emergence of nematodes from insect larvae. Field and laboratory results indicated that both fungi were common, but priority effects prevented them from co emerging from the same larva. Metarhizium- and Beauveria-infected insects did not differ in the species composition of emerging nematodes, but larvae without fungal emergence had distinct nematode communities, with Oscheius almost always emerging without fungi. Experiments indicated that none of the commonly found nematodes (Acrobeloides, Mesorhabditis, Oscheius, and Rhabditis) were entomopathogenic, but that Oscheius could exclude Beauveria if arrived early. This time dependent exclusion was likely caused by an Ochrobactrum bacterium that Oscheius nematodes carried. Together, these findings suggest that fungi enter insects as primary arrivers, while nematodes come as secondary arrivers to exploit fungus-killed insects, with priority effects influencing both groups. We suggest that this system is a promising natural microcosm for understanding priority effects across disparate groups in host parasite systems.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Previous studies using cytogenetics, isoenzymes, and molecular markers have suggested cryptic species within Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii and Anopheles (Kerteszia) bellator. We sequenced 55 genomes: 35 An. cruzii s.l. (four with Nanopore and 31 with Illumina), 12 An. bellator s.l., and eight An. homunculus, the latter two with Illumina. Phylogenomic analysis revealed at least five cryptic species within An. cruzii s.l., labelled A-E, with evidence of sympatry in some locations. Anopheles bellator s.l. also forms a species complex, comprising at least three distinct lineages. These cryptic species showed high genetic differentiation (FST range: 0.4-0.7), typical of interspecific comparisons. In contrast, An. homunculus populations showed low differentiation (FST ~ 0.2), suggesting a single widespread species.

We test here whether epigenetic reprogramming during gametogenesis completely erases intraplant epigenetic variation or, alternatively, some \"signature\" of the somatic mosaicism persists into reproductive cells. Intraplant variation in global cytosine methylation of leaf and pollen DNA samples was studied in five adult males of the dioecious tree Pistacia terebinthus (Anacardiaceae). Paired samples of fresh expanding leaves and pollen grains were taken from five different twigs in each tree, and percent cytosine methylation estimated using HPLC. Trees were internally heterogeneous in global cytosine methylation of both leaf and pollen. Within-tree variance accounted for 49.7% and 30.5% of population-wide variance in methylation for leaves and pollen, respectively. Tree means and within-tree variances in pollen methylation were directly correlated, respectively, with tree means and within-tree variances in leaf methylation. As a consequence of the epigenetic variability accumulated in somatic tissues over the individual plants' lifetimes being only weakly eroded by gametogenesis, intraplant epigenetic heterogeneity became a natural source of epigenetic gametic diversity in the wild growing population of P. terebinthus trees studied.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Previously, a shorter NF2 isoform with exon 11 skipped (merlin_e-11), induced through antisense morpholino oligomers (PMOs), was able to partially rescue the deleterious effect of nonsense variants located at that exon in patients primary fibroblast. To test the potential of this approach into Schwann cells, those responsible of NF2-SWN tumours, we developed an iPSC-based model carrying heterozygous and homozygous truncating variants on exon 11 of the NF2 gene and differentiated them to Schwann cells forming spheroids.

Proteomics reveals an inverse relationship between LRRC58 and the metabolic enzyme cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1), suggesting a cysteine-linked regulatory axis. Biochemical reconstitution and cryo-EM structures show that LRRC58 forms an active CUL2- or CUL5-based CRL that selectively positions CDO1 for ubiquitylation at Lys8. By contrast, targeted protein degradation via the VHL-based CRL is achieved by recruitment of a distinct surface of CDO1, and more promiscuous ubiquitylation independent of Lys8.

Despite their close homology in structure and the chemistry they perform, FASs and PKSs differ fundamentally in their catalytic programming: FASs run fully reducing elongation reactions to yield saturated fatty acids, while iterative PKSs execute reductions just in selected cycles, generating complex oxidized compounds. In this study, we aimed at engineering the metazoan FAS in its KR domain to switch from fully reducing to a non-reducing mode during chain elongation. Guided by recent insights into KR programming, we incorporated a helix into metazoan FAS, which is found in KRs from iterative PKSs and type II FASs with chain length programming. These FAS variants initially catalyze complete fatty acid cycles but lose the ability of {beta}-keto reduction in later elongation rounds, producing intermediates that spontaneously cyclize to pyrone products. Finally, our study provides valuable insight into the mechanism of KR catalysis identifying another amino acid next to the active tyrosine which is capable for intermediate protonation.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

How the types of available social cues and environmental volatility shape collective foraging behavior, however, remains unclear. We address this using a spatially explicit agent-based model in which agents learn to track a mobile resource via multi-agent reinforcement learning. Agents choose between random exploration, costly private tracking, and social attraction. We systematically varied resource volatility and the type of available social cues to analyze their effect on emergent foraging behavior. Our results show that the quality of social information dictates the group's collective behavior. Low-quality social cues (e.g., position, action) result in a fragile \"Cohesive Tracking\" strategy that is effective in stable environments but fails as volatility increases. Conversely, high-quality social information enables behavioral diversity. Agents selectively copy others and perform individual tracking or exploration depending on the environmental context.

Here, we combine an in vitro model system of membrane surface phase separation with thermodynamic modelling to explore the relation of 2D and 3D phase transitions. We engineered the phase-separating protein FUS to bind to membranes and quantified 2D and 3D phase separation as a function of total FUS concentration and salt concentration. We find that membrane binding induces the formation of 2D surface condensates far below the bulk saturation concentration. In addition to direct FUS-membrane binding, surface condensates sequester more FUS molecules from the bulk via protein-protein interactions, resulting in a substantial deviation from the classical binding isotherm. By changing the protein-protein interaction strength via salt titration, we find that the saturation concentrations for 2D and 3D phase separation are coupled. By extending the classical theory of condensate wetting via membrane binding, we recapitulate the experimental results and show that tuning the membrane-binding strength of a phase-separating protein provides a robust way to control 2D condensation at the membrane over a wide concentration range without entering the 3D condensation regime.

An extended study was done with 5 ppm NDMA, in which adducts were measured at 3 weeks and mutations at 10 weeks. While the level of CYP2E1 was unchanged, MGMT gene transcription was induced in females at 10 weeks. Homologous recombination-mediated chromosomal rearrangements did not increase over background. Point mutations, however, were elevated substantially in both sexes. Mutational analysis over 96 trinucleotide contexts revealed predominantly GC[-&gt;]AT mutations in 5'-purine-G-3' contexts in a pattern matching human COSMIC cancer mutational signature SBS11, with secondary features resembling SBS119 (AT[-&gt;]GC). Taken together, the data implicate m6G as the dominant mutagenic adduct under chronic dosing with NDMA. Furthermore, the genomic m6G level was identified at which its dedicated repair protein, MGMT, became saturated. The coordinated application of DNA adduct, mutational and biochemical analyses, provides a new approach for early detection and cancer management.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Despite nearly two centuries of investigation, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We developed artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural videos using predictive learning to investigate SC generation. These models successfully reproduced artificial subjective color (ASC) despite the absence of explicit color information in the training stimuli. Critically, ASC characteristics were systematically influenced by the colors of moving objects in the training videos. Using progressively simplified stimuli, ranging from natural scenes to 3D computer graphics to 2D animations, we demonstrated that the colors of moving objects are the primary determinant of ASC properties. We propose that predictive learning establishes color associations with motion patterns, causing the arcs on Benham's top to be perceived as moving objects with their corresponding colors. These findings suggest that cortical predictive mechanisms may complement retinal processes in generating subjective color phenomena.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Omitting reminders (control condition) yielded only limited learning, supporting their crucial contribution. We first confirmed these findings and excluded gaze position differences among conditions as a contributing factor. Next, we tested whether the reminders effectiveness is specific to a context of limited attention to the peripheral target caused by simultaneously performing a demanding fixation task. Removing the fixation task yielded performance levels in the first session matching those normally reached after lengthy daily training, suggesting that learning in the standard TDT involves the redeployment of attention. After changing texture parameters to increase the difficulty of the task, performing the TDT without a fixation task yielded learning in all three conditions. This indicates that in a dual-task, reminders can produce learning outcomes comparable to full training. In contrast, when the TDT is performed with full attention to the target, consolidation of the initial session alone can yield improvements equivalent to those observed in reminder and full training conditions.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

While rodent-based cultures and organoid systems have provided insights into oligodendrocyte biology, they fall short of capturing human-specific features of myelination or integrating structural and functional readouts. Here, we present MyeliMAP (Myelination MAPping), a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) -derived microphysiological and electrophysiological platform that enables robust modeling of CNS myelination. The system combines inducible hPSC-derived neurons and oligodendrocytes in a custom-engineered microfluidic microstructure designed to mimic the developing brain microenvironment, promoting spatially organized axon-glia interactions and controlled myelin sheath formation. Within six weeks, we demonstrate myelin formation and maturation by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural validation using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confirming compact multilayered wrapping of human axons. Importantly, the microstructure is directly integrated with a high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA), enabling real-time, long-term functional assessment of network activity and myelin-dependent changes in signal conduction. This allowed us to demonstrate that oligodendrocyte-based myelinated neurons display enhanced conduction velocity of action potentials compared to neuron monocultures. Moreover, the presence of oligodendrocytes stabilized the temporal neuronal network activity by reducing variability in firing patterns and enhancing synchrony across the culture. This dual structure-function approach surpasses static end-point analyses by coupling morphological validation with dynamic, quantitative measurements of maturing circuit physiology. MyeliMAP provides a reproducible, human-relevant platform to dissect neuron-glia interactions and accelerate discovery of remyelination-promoting strategies for CNS disease.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

This study elucidates the function of a CRP-LacI-lacZYA coherent type-4 FFL (Co-4 FFL) in Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) directly represses the transcription of lacI, which encodes the Lac repressor. This finding was confirmed through multiple approaches: 1) the mRNA level of lacI decreased to one-fifth of the original level upon cAMP addition; 2) lacI expression increased 15-fold in a crp mutant; 3) DNase I footprinting identified a CRP binding site within the lacI promoter region, and its functional role was validated by a lacZ fusion assay and site-directed mutagenesis. Collectively, these results establish CRP as a direct repressor of lacI, thereby forming a Co-4 FFL with the lacZYA operon. Physiological studies on Co-4 FFLs in E. coli are scarce. Our model suggests that under glucose-lactose diauxic growth conditions, this circuit allows E. coli to enhance the efficiency of lactose metabolism for energy synthesis upon glucose exhaustion by repressing lacI via CRP.

We used CRISPR in mice to knock-in the FGFR1 p.N330I variant, chosen based on its association with FGF23 excess. Skeletal phenotyping of this Fgfr1+/N330I model demonstrated markedly reduced body weight and naso-anal length, shortened long bones, and craniosynostosis, all hallmarks of the human disease. Mutant mice exhibited profound microarchitectural changes in cortical bone and severe disorganization of the growth plate and articular cartilage, driven by decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in skeletal tissues. In addition to osteochondrodysplasia, we noted dramatic increases in plasma FGF23 and hypophosphatemia, driven by upregulated Fgf23 expression and protein levels in bone, with consequent undermineralization. An in vivo ossicle assay allowed longitudinal evaluation of mineral metabolism. We modulated the signaling pathway by repurposing an inhibitor of the overactive receptor, infigratinib, resulting in partial restoration of naso-anal length in treated mutant mice.

Here, we present the Yuanyang allele pair (YYAP), an engineered underdominance gene drive system that enforces obligate co-dependency between homologous alleles via synthetic toxin-antitoxin circuits. This design produces a striking deviation from classical Mendelian segregation: YYAP alleles cannot segregate independently, reshaping inheritance outcomes without altering the physical mechanics of meiosis. In Drosophila melanogaster, optimized YYAP strain K711 exhibits >99% hemizygous lethality when crossed with wild type, while maintaining stable transmission and high fitness in transheterozygotes. Cage experiments demonstrate efficient population replacement, positioning YYAP as a confined, resistance-proof alternative to CRISPR homing gene drives. Release of only males represents a self-limiting suppression strategy that was also successful in cage experiments. By imposing a near-complete postzygotic incompatibility, YYAP establishes a programmable framework that not only supports pest management, but also enables modeling of reproductive isolation and allelic co-dependency, thereby creating opportunities to explore speciation and broader synthetic inheritance systems in ecology and evolution.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

To determine whether this common organization reflects a shared genetic program or tissue-specific regulation, we assembled a comprehensive single-cell atlas of 14 murine Multilayered epithelia. We identified a conserved p63-Notch axis that universally governs basal cell identity maintenance and suprabasal commitment. The p63-centered transcriptional program is shared, while Notch signaling recruits context-specific transcriptional modules to generate functional diversity. The layered architecture of epithelia spatially and temporally decouples conserved basal from context-specific suprabasal networks, compartmentalizing functional innovation across multilayered epithelia. Comparative genomics traces the p63-Notch axis to the root of vertebrates over 500 million years ago, showing that it was repeatedly co-opted through the incorporation of newly evolved genes in the suprabasal domain to generate novel epithelial functions. Our work establishes that evolution of multilayered epithelia operates through modular, compartmentalized diversification of a conserved scaffold of a conserved architectural scaffold, providing a unifying principle for how complex tissues achieve functional innovation while preserving structural integrity.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

However, the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully defined. The aim of this study was to establish the impact of over- and under-nutrition, with or without macronutrient supplementation, on male reproductive fitness and post-fertilisation development. Male C57/BL6J mice were fed either control diet (CD), isocaloric low protein diet (LPD), high fat/sugar  Western diet (WD) or LPD or WD supplemented with methyl-donors and carriers (MD-LPD or MD-WD respectively) for 8 weeks before mating with virgin C57/BL6J females. Placental tissue was collected at embryonic day (E)8.5, to assess early placental (ectoplacental cone) morphology and metabolism and E17.5 for sex-specific transcriptomic profiling. Post-mating, stud male tissues were harvested for assessment of testicular morphology and gene expression, gut microbiota composition and metabolic status. WD and MD-WD males displayed increased adiposity, hepatic cholesterol and free fatty acids and gut microbiota dysbiosis when compared to CD fed males. In the testes, WD and MD-WD perturbed the expression of genes associated with metabolism, Wnt signalling and transcription regulation. Despite no impact on fundamental male fertility, significant changes in ectoplacental cone metabolism, fetal growth, and placental gene expression were observed in response to specific dietary regimens. Interestingly, while CD male and female placentas displayed 301 genome-wide, sexually-dimorphic genes, LPD, MD-LPD, WD and MD-WD male and female placentas possessed only 13, 0, 14 and 15 sexually-dimorphic genes respectively.

We rule out that PCP directs apical neighbor exchanges, as junctional myosin and PCP protein localization are not co-correlated with junction shrinkage. Instead, we find that PCP directs anterior-directed crawling of placode cells along the basal surface of the tissue through a mechanism that requires cell crawling regulator Rac1. Modeling the placode as a continuum viscoelastic fluid, we find that active forces from cell crawling at the basal surface is sufficient to generate the experimentally observed counter-rotational cell motion at the apical surface.

Dogs are sensitive to human ostensive cues and reliably follow gaze direction after communicative addressing. However, whether these signals also enhance and modulate object encoding as in humans remains unknown. In a preregistered eye-tracking study, we tested pet dogs (N = 35) in a violation-of-expectation paradigm. A human actor either directed eye contact toward the dog or looked away before looking at an object. After an occlusion event, dogs viewed one of three outcomes: the same object in the same location (no change), the same object in a different location (location change), or a different object in the same location (identity change). We measured the dogs' looking times during the outcome phase within predefined areas of interest around the object. In line with our predictions and consistent with earlier findings with human infants, dogs looked significantly longer at identity changes in the communicative than in the no-eye-contact condition. In contrast, looking times at location and no-change outcomes were unaffected by communicative context, indicating a selective enhancement of identity encoding. During the initial addressing phase, pupil dilation was greater in the eye-contact condition, suggesting increased arousal or engagement.

Three internal peptide sequences from TDP-43, M1, M3, and M5, were found to enable TDP-43's mitochondrial localization and competitive inhibition using these peptides thwarted mitochondrial import of TDP-43 and rescued TDP-43-induced cytotoxicity to neurons.

Multiple all-atom MD simulations were carried out starting with two different conformations of the tandem RRMs to understand the dynamics of the target M3 region in explicit solvent water. The analysis of the simulation trajectories suggests that the M3 region is relatively non-flexible and buried relative to the other regions of the tandem RRM1-2 domains. Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3), from virtual screening, docked consistently with the M3 region in different docking strategies even amidst the region's poor solvent accessibility.

However, a unified physical picture that captures the aging dynamics remains elusive. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model in which a condensate is a composite of viscous and elastic elements with coexisting serial and parallel connections. The model naturally yields a relaxation modulus with two relaxation times, unifying the Maxwell and Jeffreys models as special limits. When applied to aging PGL-3 condensates, our model reveals that aging is primarily driven by the conversion of viscous elements into elastic ones. In contrast, the mesoscopic structure topology of the condensates remains approximately invariant. Our stochastic theory of element dynamics also predicts that the condensate viscosity either increases exponentially, in agreement with experiments, or as a power law of the waiting time, governed by a single parameter that depends on temperature and the molecular interaction strength.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

We show that this organization is at least partially preserved in plasma membrane-derived vesicles that lack cytoskeletal elements, and then demonstrate biochemical separation of the protein-rich and protein-poor domains using density centrifugation.

Using cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), we demonstrate that AA binds to E7, increasing its thermal stability and suggesting a direct molecular interaction. Mass spectrometry-based interactome analysis revealed that AA treatment reshapes the E7 interactome, enriching for E3 ubiquitin ligases (UBR4, TRIP12, TRIM28), the scaffold protein SQSTM1, and HSP40/HSP70 chaperone complexes involved in protein quality control and misfolded protein signaling. These data support a model in which AA binding induces conformational changes in E7 that enhance its recognition by ubiquitin-proteasome and chaperone-mediated degradation pathways.

NLRP12 is a cytosolic protein with inflammation-promoting and inflammation-attenuating properties. NLRP12 exhibits tumor-suppressive or tumor-promoting effects that may be cancer, cell-type, context-dependent, aided by differences in the microenvironment contributing to the pathophysiology of hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, colitis-associated cancer, and glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is a grade IV malignant brain tumor with poor patient survival and high tumor recurrence due to a heterogeneous cell population and angiogenesis. Our previous research reported NLRP12 as a potential prognostic marker for GBM with high expression in GBM patient tissues. In the present study, we investigated the role of NLRP12-mediated signalling between GBM and tumor-adjacent astrocytes, using a comprehensive panel of experimental models, including LN-229 GBM and SVG astrocyte cell lines, cell line-derived spheroids, patient-derived primary glioma cells, and patient-derived glioma organoids. We report that NLRP12 deficiency reduces cell proliferation and viability in the LN-229 cells, but increases these parameters in SVG cells. Furthermore, NLRP12-deficient LN-229 cells display attenuated ability to form three-dimensional spheroids, indicating a role of NLRP12 in anchorage-independent growth, which is considered a hallmark of tumorigenicity. Analysis of patient-derived glioma tissue and patient-derived GBM organoids revealed differential expression of NLRP12. Our findings suggest that NLRP12 modulates GBM cell proliferation, viability, and anchorage-independent growth in a cell-context dependent manner. The cell-type-specific roles of NLRP12 may underlie its complex contribution to GBM pathophysiology with implications for therapy and prognosis.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS), the primary bioactive components of Panax notoginseng, possess potent antioxidative and vasoprotective activities. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which PNS regulate endothelial integrity and BBB permeability under oxidative stress conditions. Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were treated with hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative damage, followed by intervention with PNS. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that Akap12 (A kinase anchoring protein 12) and Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) were key molecules involved in PNS mediated endothelial protection. H2O2 exposure markedly suppressed Akap12 expression and inhibited the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, leading to elevated AQP1 expression and increased BBB permeability. PNS treatment reversed these effects by restoring Akap12 expression, reactivating PI3K/AKT signaling, and reducing AQP1 levels. Functional validation further showed that AQP1 dysregulation altered the expression balance of tight junction proteins, including Claudin5 and ZO1, thereby impairing barrier function. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PNS protect endothelial cells from oxidative injury by activating Akap12 dependent PI3K/AKT signaling and modulating AQP1 associated tight junction remodeling. This study provides new mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of PNS mediated BBB protection and suggests potential therapeutic targets for oxidative or ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Our research found that an activated Src family kinase, YES, phosphorylates Y53 within the J-domain of DNAJB6b and enhances the binding between DNAJB6b and Hsp70. The strengthened association between DNAJB6b and Hsp70 may lead to the accumulation of tau aggregates.

We examined whether working memory modulates subjective perception when the general capacity for perceptual processing is kept constant. This possibility is in part motivated by the neuropsychological phenomenon of blindsight, in which subjective perception and general perceptual capacity are dissociated. To test this, in this pilot study (n = 8), we manipulated the congruency between perceptual and working memory content and examined its effects on sensitivity in a Yes/No (Y/N) detection task. To match perceptual processing capacity across conditions, we titrated stimulus contrast in a two-interval forced choice (2-IFC) task. There was a trend that working memory selectively modulated subjective perception, as measured by detection sensitivity (d) in the Y/N task, even though processing capacity in the 2-IFC task was matched. Specifically, when the working memory content was categorically incongruent with the perceptual stimulus, Y/N sensitivity was selectively impaired. These preliminary findings suggest that working memory modulates subjective perception in ways that are less general than some other manipulations, such as visual masking, which generally impairs both objective and subjective aspects of perception.

This phagocytic activity relies on tanycytic MFG-E8 and phosphatidylserine exposure on synaptic elements. Disruption of this pathway reduces synapse uptake in vitro and alters body weight control around weaning and glucose homeostasis in adulthood.

It is unclear whether these reflect persisting traces of pregnancy or effects of parenthood. We investigated effects of past birth and of pregnancy loss in women, and effects of fatherhood in men, using univariate and machine learning analyses on 205 regional brain volumes. A group of mothers and an age-matched sample of nulliparous women (N=4357 per group, mean age 63 years) from the UK Biobank, with no past pregnancy losses, showed significant volumetric group differences in 14 regions at Bonferroni-adjusted =.05. Likewise, we identified 18 significant group differences between age-matched samples of fathers and non-fathers of the same size (mean age 63.4), with 9 regions overlapping between sexes. Brain-wide association statistics for past live birth in mothers and those for fatherhood correlated (r = 0.55). XGBoost machine learning models trained to classify parenthood status separately in both datasets showed performance that was low, but significantly above chance (10-fold cross validation: AUC=0.56, p<1e-5 Motherhood classifier, AUC=0.54, p<1e-5, Fatherhood classifier, 10k permutations). We tested the motherhood classification model on an independent test sample comprising of four age-matched groups: 1. women who have never been pregnant, 2. women with past pregnancy loss but no live births, 3. women with live births but no pregnancy loss, and 4. women who experienced both. Class probability was significantly associated with live births, but not past loss. These findings may suggest that neuroanatomical patterns of past childbirth partly also reflect traces of parenthood and not solely persisting traces of past pregnancy, although a more detailed characterization of pregnancy loss data would be needed for full confirmation of this interpretation. Therefore, further research is needed to quantify the extent and understand the nature of these changes, particularly considering the known vulnerability for mental disorders associated with reproductive events.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Photoreceptor degeneration is often associated with an excessive activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Ca2+-dependent calpain-type proteases. To explore the interplay between PARP and calpain activity, we employed organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type mice and from the rd1 mouse model for IRD. Retinae were treated with the PARP inhibitors INO1001 or Olaparib, the poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) inhibitor JA2131, or the transient receptor potential channel M2 (TRPM2) blocker 8-Br-ADPR. Readouts included the TUNEL assay to detect cell death, in situ activity assays for histone-deacetylases (HDAC), PARP, and calpain, as well as immunostaining for activated calpain-2, and poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR). PARP, PARG, and TRPM2 inhibition reduced calpain activity and calpain-2 activation. PARP activity was decreased by PARP and TRPM2 inhibitors but not by PARG inhibition. Remarkably, the PARP inhibitor INO1001 increased HDAC activity unlike any of the other compounds. When combined with the PARG inhibitor JA2131, INO1001 reduced photoreceptor cell death in a synergistic fashion, although such synergy was not observed for calpain or PARP activity. Moreover, synergistic photoreceptor preservation was not observed when JA2131 was combined with the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Overall, these results indicate that in rd1 photoreceptors, PARP controls calpain activity via PARG and TRPM2-induced Ca2+ influx. We also characterize INO1001 as potentially more beneficial for IRD treatment than Olaparib.

In this study, we examined whether air plasma influences the germination of Echinochloa crus-galli, a major paddy field weed. When seeds were cultivated without stratification, direct irradiation with air plasma did not enhance germination. In contrast, once dormancy was partially released by cold stratification, plasma treatment significantly promoted germination. Interestingly, the effect disappeared after prolonged chilling, when dormancy was completely released. These results suggest that plasma promotes germination by acting on the dormancy-breaking process. In addition, plasma-activated water (PAW) also stimulated germination, although its effect was weaker than that of gaseous plasma. Overall, this study demonstrates that air plasma can promote the germination of grass weed seeds, providing a potential strategy for weed control by inducing germination prior to crop seeding.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

In vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed a significant cortical accumulation of eATP in AD mice as early as 2 months of age--before amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive impairment. This increase is associated with inflammasome activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, microglia reactivity, aberrant synaptic pruning and perineuronal net degradation. Strikingly, genetic deletion of P2X7R rescues these alterations. Two-photon calcium imaging further demonstrates that P2X7R knockout counteracts AD-related neuronal hyperactivity. These findings set the eATP-P2X7R signaling axis as an early driver of AD pathology, linking neuroinflammation to synaptic remodeling and circuit dysfunction, and suggest P2X7R inhibition as a compelling strategy to counteract AD progression.", "date": "2025-11-14", "journal": ""}

Animals heard vocal sequences from three social contexts (angry, conversational, food-related) presented in intact, reversed, or randomized order, with call identity held constant. Disrupting sequence order altered responses across a distributed cortical-subcortical network. Contrast to reversed order, intact sequences drove stronger activation in prefrontal, cingulate, parietal, and somatosensory regions, whereas randomization produced the most widespread disruptions, additionally recruiting motor, insular, hippocampal, and thalamic territories. Uni- and multivariate analyses revealed a core network - including prefrontal area 8, cingulate areas 24/32, somatosensory cortex, and parietal Tpt - consistently sensitive to temporal coherence, with broader recruitment under severe disruption. Network-level dynamics further varied by context: conversation elicited earlier sensitivity to sequence disruptions, angry peaked later, and food built more gradually.

Given its known role as a transcription factor regulating systemic energy metabolism, we explored its potential contribution to brain metabolism and behavior. To this end, we used a conditional knockout model with postnatal TCF7L2 loss in the thalamus and partial deficiency in the pancreas. Tcf7l2 knockout mice exhibited social deficits and reduced motor habituation. In parallel, they also developed systemic glucose intolerance, modelling the psychiatric-metabolic comorbidity. Thalamic depletion of TCF7L2 resulted in elevated inhibitory phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase an enzymatic gatekeeper for pyruvate utilization in energy production in the thalamus and cortex. This was accompanied by altered thalamic and cortical metabolism, characterized by reduced efficiency of pyruvate oxidation alongside enhanced oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies. Notably, a ketogenic diet alleviated metabolic dysregulation in the brain and normalized the approach to social novelty in knockout mice.
