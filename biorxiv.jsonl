{"title": "Pathwise approximations to solving the filtering problem for the stochastic chemostat", "doi": "10.1101/2023.01.17.524503", "authors": "Fontenele Magalhaes, J. A.; Emzir, M. F.; Corona, F.", "abstract": "This paper concerns the inverse problem of characterising the state of a bioreactor from observations. In laboratory settings, the bioreactor is represented by a device called a chemostat. We consider a differential description of the evolution of the state of the chemostat under environmental fluctuations. First, we model the state evolution as a stochastic process driven by Brownian motion. Under this model, our best knowledge about the state of the chemostat is described by its probability distribution in time, given the distribution of the initial state. The corresponding probability density function solves a deterministic partial differential equation (PDE), the Kolmogorov forward equation. While this provides a probabilistic description, incorporating an observation process allows for a more refined characterisation of the state. More formally, we are interested in obtaining the distribution of the state conditional on an observation process as the solution to a filtering problem, with the corresponding conditional probability density function solving a non-linear stochastic PDE, the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. This paper focuses on the pathwise formulation of this filtering problem in which inferences about the state are obtained conditional on a fixed stream of observations. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the governing differential equations, ensuring well-posedness before presenting numerical approximations. We approximate the pathwise solution to the filtering problem by combining the finite difference and splitting methods for solving PDEs, and then compare the approximated solution with results from a linearisation method and a classical sequential Monte Carlo method. Relevance to Life Sciences: Chemostats serve as simplified and controlled laboratory environments for studying complex microbial and ecological dynamics. In industrial settings, they are scaled up into bioreactors used for the production of pharmaceuticals and biofuels, among other bioproducts. Accurately estimating the state of these systems using the Kushner-Stratonovich equation provides essential information for real-time monitoring and control. This, in turn, supports consistent outcomes and reproducible system behaviour across both experimental studies and industrial production cycles. In addition to bioreactor systems, the mathematical framework developed in this work is also applicable to broader challenges in the life sciences, such as ecological monitoring and disease dynamics. As with the chemostat, these systems are governed by differential equations subject to environmental fluctuations, and inference from partial observations follows the same principles presented here. Mathematical Content: In this work, the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the governing differential equations are established under less restrictive conditions than those of classical stochastic calculus. Additionally, the exit time associated with the Markov process modelling the state is analysed using the Khasminskii test. These properties are particularly relevant to our application as they ensure that the models admit unique solutions remaining within a biologically meaningful domain. The well-posedness of the PDEs is also established under less stringent conditions compared to standard PDE theory. Lastly, the accuracy of the numerical approximations is assessed using a distance metric between probability distributions.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have examined species-specific protein-coding genes and related regulatory sequences, revealing that birth, loss, and changes in these genes and sequences can drive speciation and evolution. However, investigations of species-specific lncRNA genes and the related regulatory sequences, which critically determine epigenetic regulation, remain very limited. We identified human-specific (HS) lncRNAs from GENCODE-annotated human lncRNAs, predicted their DNA binding domains (DBDs) and binding sites (DBSs) genome-wide, analyzed the DBS sequences in modern humans (CEU, CHB, and YRI), archaic humans (Altai Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Vindija Neanderthals), and chimpanzees, and analyzed how HS lncRNAs and DBSs influence gene expression in modern and archaic humans. Our results suggest that HS lncRNAs and their DBSs have substantially reshaped gene expression. This reshaping has evolved continuously from archaic to modern humans, enabling humans to adapt to new environments and lifestyles, promoting brain evolution, and also resulting in differences among modern humans. Further analyses of HS TFs and their DBSs obtained results suggesting that HS lncRNAs may contribute more significantly than HS TFs to human evolution.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) enables analysis of gene expression changes within specific cell-types, potentially offering insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying aging. However, most brain snRNA-seq datasets used age-matched controls from studies focused on pathological processes and have largely been limited to cortical regions. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the non-pathological aging process in brain regions that are vulnerable to age-related diseases. Here, we report a snRNA-seq study of 6 young (20-30 years) and 7 aged (60-85 years) encompassing four different brain regions: the entorhinal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, subventricular zone, and putamen. We captured over 150,000 nuclei that represented 10 broad cell-types. While we did not find statistically significant differences in cell-type proportions with age, region- and cell-type-specific differential expression analyses identified over 8,000 age-associated genes. Notably, within a given cell-type, most of these associations were region-specific. Functional enrichment analyses of the gene sets for each cell-type-region combination revealed diverse biological processes, including multiple hallmarks of aging, such as proteostasis, interactions with cytokines, vesicular trafficking, metabolism, inflammation, and metal ion homeostasis. Overall, our findings suggest that unique cell-types exhibit distinct transcriptional aging profiles both at the cell-type level and across different brain regions.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Routing, sliding, and interlacing staple strands lead to the creation of a large 700-bit key size. The realization of practical DNA data storage requires high information density, robust security, and accurate and rapid information retrieval. To meet these requirements, advanced readout techniques and large encryption key sizes are essential. In this study, we report an enhanced DNA origami cryptography protocol to encrypt information in 2D and 3D DNA origami structures, increasing the number of possible scaffold routings and increasing the encryption key size. We employed all-DNA-based steganography with fast readout through high-speed 2D and 3D DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging, which enables higher information density. By combining 2D and 3D DNA-PAINT data with unsupervised clustering, we achieved an accuracy of up to 89% and high ratios of correct-to-wrong readout, despite the significant flexibility in the 3D DNA origami structure shown by oxDNA simulation. Furthermore, we propose design criteria that ensure complete information retrieval for the DNA origami cryptography protocol.

In maize, model predictions and live imaging coincide precisely, and in Arabidopsis, final lobe patterns correlate more with growth history than with cell size alone. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of lobe formation constrains leaf expansion or drives compensatory elongation, which underscores a mechanical function. A broad survey of living and fossil vascular plants reveals that the mechanism to make puzzle-shaped cells is both widespread and developmentally plastic, suggesting that single snapshots of leaves can give insight into their growth history.

A question that remains is how changes in brain functional and structural integrity affect single voxel autocorrelation. In this study we investigate how hippocampal autocorrelation is affected by hippocampal dysfunction by investigating a population of patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Many patients with TLE have mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), characterized by scarring and neuronal loss particularly in the anterior hippocampus. Here we compared patients with left and right TLE, some with and without MTS, to healthy controls. We applied our single voxel autocorrelation method and data-driven clustering approach to segment the hippocampus based on the autocorrelation of resting state fMRI. We found that patients with left TLE had longer intrinsic timescales (i.e., higher autocorrelation) compared to controls, particularly in the anterior-medial portion of the hippocampus. This was true for both the epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic hemispheres. We also evaluated the extent of cluster preservation (i.e., spatial overlap with controls) of patient autocorrelation clusters and the relationship to verbal and visuospatial memory. We found that patients with greater cluster preservation in the anterior-medial hippocampus had better memory performance. Surprisingly, we did not find any effect of MTS on single voxel autocorrelation, despite the structural changes associated with the condition. These results suggest that spatiotemporal dynamics of activity can be informative regarding the functional integrity of the hippocampus in TLE.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Herein, we present an approach to assess the gut microbiome with stool-based gut metatranscriptome data from a large adult human population (n = 80,570), using irritable bowel syndrome as an example that features both an abnormal gut microbiome and a spectrum of distinct conditions. We develop a suite of eight gut microbial functional pathway scores, each of which represents the activity of a set of interacting microbial functional features (based on KEGG orthology) relevant to known gut biochemical activities. We use a normative approach within a subpopulation (n = 9,350) to define \"Good\" and \"Not Optimal\" activities for these transcriptome-based gut pathway scores. We hypothesize that Not Optimal scores are associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and its subtypes (i.e., IBS-Constipation, IBS-Diarrhea, IBS-Mixed Type). We show that Not Optimal functional pathway scores are associated with higher odds of IBS or its subtypes within an independent cohort (n = 71,220) using both the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire as well as self-reported phenotypes. Rather than waiting to diagnose IBS after symptoms appear, these functional pathway scores can help to provide early health insights into molecular pathways that may contribute to IBS.

V.; Ali, J.; Gal'chinsky, N.", "abstract": "Advances in molecular genetics, nucleic acid synthesis, and bioinformatics have created novel opportunities for plant protection. DNA and RNA now serve as active insecticidal ingredients, transcending their traditional role as carriers of genetic information. Critically, nucleic acids function as tools for pest control through two fundamentally distinct mechanisms: DNA containment (DNAc), employing oligonucleotide insecticides based on contact unmodified antisense DNA biotechnology (CUADb), and RNA interference (RNAi), employing RNA biocontrols based on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) technology. It is essential to recognize that CUADb is not a variant of dsRNA technology; these are separate approaches with unique molecular actions. Early partial understanding of how antisense RNA and DNA oligonucleotides might function emerged in the 1960s--1970s. The role of antisense RNA within dsRNA fragments, central to RNAi, was dis-covered in the late 1990s as an antiviral immune response in nematodes. The RNAi approach then underwent extensive development for plant protection. In contrast, the CUADb approach originated independently, manifesting as effective oligonucleotide insecticides against lepidopterans in 2008. The subsequent discovery of its DNAc mechanism revealed its fundamental importance in disrupting rRNA biogenesis and ribosome production, a process entirely distinct from RNAi. As separate classes of next-generation insecticides, the end-products of these independent technologies offer long utility duration, low carbon footprint, high selectivity, and rapid environmental biodegradation. Currently, their efficacy profiles diverge: CUADb and DNAc demonstrate optimal results against Sternorrhyncha (e.g., aphids, mealybugs, psyllids, scale insects), while dsRNA technology and RNAi show the strongest insecticidal potential against beetles from the Tenebrionidae and Chrysomelidae families. Therefore, CUADb-based oligonucleotide insecticides represent a mature and distinct platform, not merely a supplementary or embryonic stage relative to RNAi. Highly likely, both technologies will prove effective against specific insect groups and could be deployed complementarily in formulations for broader pest control, leveraging their unique mechanisms of action.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Despite this, species-specific management is limited, particularly around primary fishing hotspots. This is in part due to knowing very little about fundamental population processes. Here, we combine mitochondrial and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to carry out the first genetic assessment of R. ancylostomus across the Northwest Indian Ocean. We detect genetic differentiation across the northwest range, shaped by both oceanographic barriers and intrinsic dispersal constraints, and uncover a cline in genetic variation from east to west.

Primary inoculum (i.e. oospores) play a decisive role in downy mildew epidemics, but we still know very little about its abundance in vineyard soil. This study presents a novel molecular method for quantifying P. viticola oospore concentration in vineyard soil using digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). The development of this method enabled characterization of both the abundance and spatial distribution of oospores in a vineyard at the onset of the growing season. Following a regular grid, a total of 198 soil samples (0-15cm horizon) were collected in March 2022 in grapevine rows in a 0.22 ha vineyard planted with cv. Merlot and conducted according to French organic viticulture specifications. Additional samples were collected from the same field within five nested sampling plots with three distance levels, including samples collected in the inter-rows. Using ddPCR, we found P. viticola DNA in all soil samples except one, and we estimated that oospore concentration ranged from 0 to 1858 oospores per gram of soil (303 on average). The distribution of oospores at field scale was not random but characterized by 15 m-diameter patches of concentrically increasing oospore concentration. Oospores accumulated 5 times more below the vine stocks than in the inter-row. Using a leaf disc bioassay, we found that soil infectious potential significantly increased with oospore concentration assessed by ddPCR. However, the low coefficient of determination of the relationship indicated that DNA-based oospore quantification lacked clear epidemiological significance. Both ddPCR and bioassay methods are valuable tools that could be used to assess reservoirs of P. viticola primary inoculum across different agroclimatic contexts, thereby bringing greater genericity. Further methodological improvement will also help refine the accuracy of DNA-based assessment of primary inoculum reservoir and improve our understanding of the relationship between primary inoculum reservoir and epidemic dynamics. Ultimately, these data will be essential for improving epidemic risk models and evaluating new preventive disease management strategies targeting the primary inoculum.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

HFS of the medial geniculate body (MGB) induced thalamocortical long-term potentiation (LTP) in wild-type young adult mice. However, knockdown of Cck expression in MGB neurons or blockade of the CCK-B receptor (CCKBR) in the ACx abolished HFS-induced LTP. Interestingly, this LTP could not be elicited in juvenile (3-week-old) or aged mice (over 18-month-old) due to distinct mechanisms: the absence of CCKBR in juveniles and the inability to release CCK in aged mice. Notably, exogenous administration of CCK into the ACx rescued LTP in aged mice and significantly improved frequency discrimination.

Aberrant RNA splicing is a hallmark of cancer, but its role in pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors remains underexplored. Methods: We analyzed 752 primary pediatric brain tumors spanning histologies and molecular subtypes to characterize aberrant splicing. We developed the Splicing Burden Index (SBI) as a sample-level metric and performed hierarchical clustering of variable splice events. Cluster-specific events were annotated for overlap with functional protein domains. We conducted in vitro experiments to assess the role of the splicing regulator CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1). Results: Clustering identified 11 splicing-defined groups, several enriched for distinct tumor types, though heterogeneity was observed across histologies. Cluster 6, with the poorest event-free survival, comprised multiple histologies and contained 39,528 aberrant splice events across 10,412 genes, including 8,369 single exon (SE) events overlapping known functional protein domains. CLK1 expression was most positively correlated with SE SBI in Cluster 6, and inclusion of its exon 4 (active kinase isoform) was widespread and associated with inferior event-free survival. Pharmacologic inhibition of CLK1 with cirtuvivint suppressed viability and proliferation in KNS-42 cells, while morpholinos targeting exon 4 reduced CLK1 RNA and protein abundance, impaired growth, and induced splicing and expression changes in cancer-related genes. Conclusions: This study maps splicing dysregulation in pediatric brain tumors, defines biologically- and clinically-relevant splicing-defined subgroups, and identifies CLK1 as a regulator of oncogenic splicing programs. These findings support therapeutic targeting of splicing kinases in high-risk pediatric CNS tumors.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Background invariance requires an adaptation strategy that shifts ORN response amplitude rather than sensitivity, diverging from efficient coding principles in single neurons. This property supports contrast encoding in ORN populations necessary for background compensation across the glomeruli.

Following duplication events, gene copies (paralogues) may undergo various fates, including retention with functional modifications (such as silencing, sub-functionalisation, or neo-functionalisation) or loss. When paralogues are retained, this results in complex orthology relationships, including one-to-many or many-to-many. In such cases, determining which one-to-one pair is more likely to have conserved functions, can be challenging. It has been proposed that, following gene duplication, the copy that diverges more slowly in sequence is more likely to maintain the ancestral function - referred to here as \"the least diverged orthologue (LDO) conjecture\". This study explores this conjecture, using a novel method to identify asymmetric evolution of paralogues and apply it to all gene families across the Tree of Life in the PANTHER database. Structural data for over 1 million proteins and expression data for 16 animals and 20 plants were then used to investigate functional divergence following duplication. This analysis, the most comprehensive to date, revealed that whilst the majority of paralogues display similar rates of sequence evolution, significant differences in branch lengths following gene duplication can be correlated with functional divergence. Overall, the results support the least diverged orthologue conjecture, suggesting that the least diverged orthologue (LDO) tends to retain the ancestral function, whilst the most diverged orthologue (MDO) may acquire a new, potentially specialised, role.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Glioma cells exhibited a two-fold reduction in global m6A, suggesting progressive loss from healthy to malignant states.

Regulator KD, particularly ALKBH5 induced redistribution of m6A toward 3'UTR with consequent gene upregulation. We also identified m6A-mediated isoform switching, with a higher usage of retained intron and nonsense-mediated decay isoforms. Structural and splicing alterations at the isoform level were identified unique to each KD condition indicating m6A driven aberrant alternative splicing. At the functional level, KD specific remodeling of oncogenic signaling was also observed. ALKBH5 KD suppressed MYC targets and pro-apoptotic signaling while METTL3 KD enhanced mTOR and PI3K-AKT signaling.

Here, we demonstrate that incorporating rodent behavioural biases into the successor representation successfully reproduces the heterogeneous activity patterns of subicular neurons. This framework accounts for the emergence of boundary and corner cells - neuronal types absent in upstream hippocampal regions. We provide evidence that subicular firing patterns are more accurately described by the successor representation than a purely spatial or boundary vector cell model of subiculum.

J.", "abstract": "Single-cell genomics allows for the unbiased exploration of cellular heterogeneity. Representation learning methods summarize high-dimensional single-cell data into a manageable latent space in a typically nonlinear fashion, allowing cross-sample integration or generative modeling. However, these methods often produce entangled representations, limiting interpretability and downstream analyses. Existing disentanglement methods instead either require supervised information or impose sparsity and linearity, which may not capture the complexity of biological data. We, therefore, introduce Disentangled Representation Variational Inference (DRVI), an unsupervised deep generative model that learns nonlinear, disentangled representations of single-cell omics. This is achieved by combining recently introduced additive decoders with nonlinear pooling, for which we theoretically prove disentanglement under reasonable assumptions. We validate DRVI's disentanglement capabilities across diverse relevant biological problems, from development to perturbational studies and cell atlases, decomposing, for example, the Human Lung Cell Atlas into meaningful, interpretable latent dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that if applied to batch integration, DRVI's integration quality does not suffer from the disentanglement constraints and instead is on par with entangled integration methods. With its disentangled latent space, DRVI is inherently interpretable and facilitates the identification of rare cell types, provides novel insights into cellular heterogeneity beyond traditional cell types, and highlights developmental stages.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Since late 2021, a panzootic of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has driven significant morbidity and mortality in wild birds, domestic poultry, and mammals. In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by ~8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by ~46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected ~10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as early warning signals for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

In this observational field study, participants (N=39) wore a calibrated melanopic light logger at chest level for 30 consecutive days. At baseline and study end, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was assessed, and every 3 to 4 days, the Light Exposure Behaviour Assessment (LEBA) was filled. Our pre-registered analyses reveal that participants in Switzerland experienced brighter days (+3.16 times the average mel EDI) and spent more time (x1.9 times the duration) in daylight levels per hour of daylight, had ~1.5h later bright light exposure in the afternoon, and stayed over 1h longer in dim light conditions before bedtime. LEBA scores did not differ between Malaysia and Switzerland, and LEBA items were stable over time. LEBA items also correlated with objective light exposure variables in Switzerland but not Malaysia, with a medium effect size (range of absolute r=0.32-0.48).

Although fasting resolves the challenge of winter food scarcity, it also removes dietary carbon, a critical biomolecular building block. Here, we demonstrate a process of urea carbon salvage (UCS) in the 13 lined ground squirrel, whereby urea carbon is reclaimed through gut microbial ureolysis and used in reductive acetogenesis, producing acetate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) of major value to the host and its microbial community. We find that urea carbon incorporation into acetate is more efficient during hibernation than the summer active season, and that while both host and gut microbes oxidize acetate for energy throughout the year, the ability of the host to absorb and oxidize acetate is highest during hibernation. Metagenomic data of the gut microbiome indicate retention during hibernation of genes involved in the degradation of gut mucin, an abundant endogenous nutrient. The hydrogen disposal associated with reductive acetogenesis from urea carbon provides a luminal environment that sustains fermentation of mucin oligosaccharides, thereby generating SCFAs and other metabolites usable by both the host and its gut microbes. Our findings introduce UCS as a novel mechanism that enables hibernating squirrels and their gut microbes to exploit two key endogenous nutrient sources (urea and mucins) in the resource limited hibernation season.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Trophic ecosystem models generally predict a tight coupling between prey and fish predators, such that higher abundance of lower trophic species increases abundance of higher trophic level predators. This assumes that predator feeding rates are limited by prey availability to some degree. Despite being a key component of predator-prey interactions and multi-species fisheries management, relatively few studies have assessed the impacts of prey availability on predation patterns of mobile, generalist fish predators using spatiotemporal models and local-scale stomach content, predator, and prey data. In this study, we explore the association between local density of key prey and predator stomach contents, and predator-prey spatiotemporal overlap and predation indices, using the Baltic Sea as a case study. We use three decades of spatially resolved biomass and stomach content data on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), and biomass data on three of its key prey: herring (Clupea harengus), the isopod Saduria entomon, and sprat (Sprattus sprattus). Using geostatistical generalized linear mixed effects models fitted to relative biomass density and prey-weight-per-predator-weight, we estimate spatiotemporal trends and annual indices of biomass weighted and area-expanded per-capita and population-level predation, predator-prey overlap, and the correlation between these indices. Range shifts have resulted in reduced predator-prey overlap over time, which is now the lowest in three decades. For Saduria, we find an association between prey availability and stomach contents, but not for herring or sprat. Similarly, only in Saduria do we find a positive correlation between population-level predation indices and the spatiotemporal overlap. Although behavioral interactions with pelagic prey are challenging to infer from stomach content and acoustic data due to high mobility leading to fine-scale spatiotemporal mismatch, the weak connection with local-scale availability, and low correlation between population-level predation and spatial overlap, could imply weaker coupling between pelagic prey and cod than previously thought. These findings provide key information on the strength of species interactions, which is crucial for the continued development of multispecies models and ecosystem-based fisheries management.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

The model also predicts the pattern of burst size vs. lysis time along environmental gradients in terms of a parameter, Q, that describes the ratio of virus productivity to bacterial productivity.

In this study, we found that inulin can enhance the growth capacity of Lysinibacillus sphaericus HR92 and its ability to inhibit Ralstonia solanacearum. Further investigation revealed that inulin can enhance strain HR92s flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis, fatty acid metabolism, and siderophore synthesis capabilities, ultimately improving strain HR92s effectiveness in controlling bacterial wilt. Moreover, adding inulin to the soil can enrich Pseudarthrobacter strains. This genus enhances the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of the antibacterial substance HR92, and competes for nutrients with Ralstonia solanacearum, thereby further inhibiting the occurrence of bacterial wilt disease. Additionally, the combination of inulin and Pseudarthrobacter strains upregulates the valine and leucine pathway genes in strain HR92. These genes play a crucial role in the synthesis of surfactin and the antimicrobial VOC 3-methyl-1-butanol.

Phosphorylation of I{kappa}B proteins by IKK results in their degradation and consequent activation of NF-{kappa}B transcription factors. RIPK1, a critical cell death regulator, is also a direct target of IKK kinase activity, thereby repressing its cell death activity. In {beta} T cells, the RIPK1 kinase activity of IKK is critical for normal thymic development while mature {beta} T cells require IKK for both activation of NF-{kappa}B dependent survival programmes, and repression of RIPK1. {gamma}{delta} T cells play a unique and versatile role in host immunity with specific effector functions that enables them to act as early responders in immune defense. The role of IKK regulated pathways in their development and survival is not known. Here, we use mouse genetics to dissect the function of IKK and downstream pathways in the normal homeostasis of {gamma}{delta} T cells. We find that IKK expression is critical to establish a replete {gamma}{delta} T cell compartment, but that requires vary between different subsets. Type 1 {gamma}{delta} T cells require IKK dependent NF-{kappa}B activation for their generation, while IKK is redundant for development of adaptive {gamma}{delta} T cells. Instead, IKK dependent NF-{kappa}B activation is required for their longterm survival. We also find evidence that IKK repression of RIPK1 is required for survival of peripheral but not thymic {gamma}{delta} T cells.

However, little information is available about how polyamines improve salt tolerance. Methods: This study was conducted to investigate whether exogenous polyamine application has the potential to maintain poplar growth and yield under a short duration of salt stress. We analyzed the trends in growth and physiological and biochemical responses of hybrid poplar (Populus nigra x maximowiczii, clone NM6) plants to salt stress by foliar application of putrescine (a diamine). Leaves of young greenhouse-grown plants were sprayed with 1 mM putrescine on several days following one-time application of 100 mM and 200 mM NaCl via roots. For measurement of growth, plant height, stem diameter, and leaf number for each plant were recorded throughout the experiment. Studies on the physiological and biochemical trends included gas exchange, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, soluble sugars and proteins, amino acids, polyamines, and relative water content in leaves. Results: Putrescine spray on the salt-treated plants caused a significant increase in chlorophyll a & b, carotenoids, and soluble proteins on a fresh weight basis. Putrescine application caused a significant increase in fructose, glucose, and galactose in all plants, but putrescine spray had a variable impact on the sucrose content of 100 mM NaCl-treated plants. Based on metabolic responses, plants treated with 100 mM NaCl fared better when sprayed with putrescine than those treated with 200 mM NaCl. Discussion: In conclusion, the results indicate that putrescine did reverse the effects of salt in many ways, and there were trends indicating that sprayed putrescine promotes salt tolerance in young poplar plants.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to investigate these effects using a porcine model. Experimental Approach: Naive and anti-PEG antibody-sensitized pigs were intravenously injected with Comirnaty. Acute anaphylactic responses were assessed through hemodynamic monitoring, hematological changes, and plasma inflammatory markers. Multiorgan inflammatory effects were evaluated by qPCR detection of spike protein (SP) mRNA uptake and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in seven organs over 6 hours. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were also performed. Key Results: Severe cardiopulmonary distress developed within minutes of repeated i.v. injections of Comirnaty. qPCR revealed predominant SP mRNA accumulation in liver and PBMCs, with spleen, kidney, lymph nodes, heart, and brain also affected in 40-90% of animals. Repetitive PBMC transfection showed reversible mRNA peaks at 15 minutes, followed by rapid decay. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1RA, CXCL10, TNF-alpha, CCL2) paralleled mRNA uptake, suggesting a causal relationship. Cytokine profiles varied by organ (e.g. IL-1RA in kidney, CCL2 in PBMCs). Histologic abnormalities and SP immunopositivity were noted in the kidney, heart, and brain. Booster injections replicated PBMC transfection kinetics observed at the first dose. Conclusions and Implications: This porcine model reveals systemic anaphylactic reactivity and multiorgan SP mRNA transfection following i.v. injection of mRNA-LNPs, resulting in organ-specific inflammatory responses.

We trained separate XGBoost models on three cfDNA datasets from previously published studies, each based on a different bisulfite sequencing methodology: MCTA Seq, targeted bisulfite sequencing (using methylation-correlated blocks), and low-pass whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). For each model, we selected features based on biologically relevant methylation markers reported in the original study, ensuring that feature selection was grounded in experimentally validated signals. A meta-classifier was trained on shared CpG site features to route incoming samples to the most appropriate model, eliminating the need for forced feature harmonization. To evaluate generalizability, we used an independent moderate-depth WGBS liver tissue dataset for blind validation. The dataset was filtered separately to match the feature set of each training model. Models trained on MCTA Seq and WGBS generalized well (blind validation accuracy up to 92%), while the padlock probe based MCB model failed to transfer, underscoring the importance of platform aware modeling. Across datasets, methylation patterns separating cancerous from non-cancerous samples remained stable, even when absolute values shifted, as in tissue vs. blood. Threshold adjustment compensated for this shift without compromising classification. Intra dataset k-fold accuracy remained consistently high, confirming the robustness of methylation based classification across patient cohorts and disease stages. Overall, we demonstrate a generalizable machine learning framework capable of predicting HCC with over 90% accuracy using cfDNA methylation data from any of three distinct bisulfite sequencing assays, including off-the-shelf whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) at moderate depth. By aligning assay specific models with a meta classifier for sample routing, we provide a modular strategy that avoids harmonization pitfalls while preserving accuracy. The next logical step is clinical validation using biobank-derived plasma samples sequenced with WGBS and passed through this framework to confirm real world performance.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenases (encoded by the gene xoxF) are now recognized as the key catalysts for methylotrophy in many environments, yet the identity of the most transcriptionally active methylotrophs in open ocean waters (\"Clade X\") has remained elusive. Here we show that \"Clade X\" methylotrophs belong to the deep-branching alphaproteobacterial order TMED127, which we propose be renamed 'Methylaequorales'; 'methyl' for 'methylotrophic metabolism' and 'aequor' for 'ocean surface', as these bacteria are most transcriptionally active near the sea surface. TMED127/Methylaequorales are present in surface waters of tropical and subtropical oceans throughout the global ocean. They have small, streamlined genomes (~1.5 Mb), and appear to be obligate methylotrophs that use the serine cycle for carbon assimilation. They display a diel pattern of xoxF5 and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) transcription, peaking in the late afternoon, in oligotrophic surface water of the Sargasso Sea. Several other highly transcribed genes of unknown function had no homologs outside of TMED127/Methylaequorales genomes.

Amblyopia provides a perfect case for studying the neural generation of percepts (Generative Phenomenology) because many amblyopes see phantom forms that contain more features than the stimulus through their amblyopic eye (AE) but not through the fellow eye (FE). Seeing phantom forms is unlike most visual disorders that lead to deficits and requires different types of models. Using computer guided dichoptic displays, we acquired perceptograms (viewable records of perceived images) for single gratings shown to AE. 92.6% of phantom percepts were matched exactly by plaid patterns made of two gratings shown to FE. A formal equation between the cortical signals generated by the gratings seen through AE with the signals generated by their perceptograms seen through FE was used to derive AE receptive fields as linear transforms of FE receptive fields. Passing gratings through the transformed AE model accurately generated the corresponding perceptograms. The transformations reflected complex changes in cortical receptive fields and output combinations. They also explained amblyopic deficits at discerning cyclic distortions from circularity and were validated via reverse-correlation. Changes in neuronal receptive fields thus have profound effects on perception, to the extent that observers can see more features than are present in what is viewed.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Post-mortem diffusion MRI plays a key role in investigative pipelines to characterise tissue microstructure, with long scan times facilitating the acquisition of datasets with improved spatial/angular resolution and reduced artefacts versus in vivo. Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) has emerged as a powerful technique for post-mortem imaging, achieving high SNR-efficiency and strong diffusion weighting in the challenging imaging environment of fixed tissue. However, the sophisticated signal forming mechanisms of DW-SSFP limit the integration of advanced microstructural models (e.g. incorporating time-dependence; Monte-Carlo simulations) with parameter estimation routines. Here, I investigate the integration of DW-SSFP with neural posterior estimation (NPE), a parameter inference technique leveraging concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning to directly estimate P({theta} | S) (i.e. the posterior distribution of parameters {theta} given signal S). A key challenge is that diffusion attenuation in DW-SSFP is dependent on tissue relaxation properties (T1/T2) and transmit inhomogeneity (B1), which must be incorporated into the NPE network for accurate modelling. By using NPE to estimate P({theta} | S,T1,T2,B1) (i.e. conditioning on S and known T1/T2/B1), using a Tensor representation, I demonstrate that NPE achieves accurate parameter estimation even in the presence of non-Gaussian (Rician) noise in low-SNR regimes. Comparisons with conventional non-linear least-squares (NLLS) using both synthetic and experimental DW-SSFP data (whole human post-mortem brain) give excellent agreement, with NPE providing 1000s of posterior samples in a matched evaluation time. Taken together, findings provide a framework to integrate advanced microstructural models with DW-SSFP, and an intuitive approach to incorporate conditional dependencies with NPE.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Indeed, stimulus repetition leads to classically described neuronal response decreases, and to more recently described neuronal gamma synchronization increases (sometimes preceded by decreases for a few trials). Here, we used a full-screen colored background (FSCB) and a flashed black bar, while recording multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFP) from area V1 of an awake macaque monkey. We found that the FSCB repetition induced neuronal response increases (sometimes preceded by decreases for a few trials) and gamma synchronization decreases (preceded by increases for a few trials). These effects are largely opposite to the dominant previous findings. Intriguingly, these surprising effects largely reversed when we isolated the responses to the flashed black bar. We discuss these findings, considering differences to previous studies with regards to the subject of the study, the stimuli and the task. We notice that in studies reporting classical results for gamma, sometimes in combination with firing rates, the stimuli were typically (partly) predictive of the reward. Here, we found non-classical results for the FSCB that was not reward predictive, and classical results for the black bar that was reward predictive. Whether this has revealed a general effect of reward predictive versus non-predictive stimuli will require further investigation with stimuli and task designs tailored specifically for this question.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Earlier studies revealed that Salmonella deploys ethanolamine (EA) metabolic machinery to disseminate in the intestine. Salmonella with a defect in EA metabolism manifests with lower intestinal colonization efficiency. Remarkably, the potential of EA metabolism as a therapeutic target is yet to explore. Our study revealed that supplementation of EA and vitamin B12 in both rich and minimal media enhanced biofilm formation, increased motility, and increased tolerance of Salmonella to some antibiotics. Conversely, mutants deficient in EA metabolic enzymes exhibited no physiological fitness. In Salmonella, EA metabolic enzymes are localized within a proteinaceous microcompartment (MCP) shell composed of thousands of copies of shell proteins encoded by five genes from the eut operon. Fascinatingly, bacterial cells with defective MCP shell due to mutation in the major shell proteins showed enhanced susceptibility towards a number of antibiotics in minimal media. The mutants were unable to form biofilm, produced lower curli expression and were defective in flagellar motility. Also, mutation in one of the major shell proteins reduced intramacrophagic viability of Salmonella. Notably, phenotypes were restored upon ectopic expression of corresponding genes. It was evident that mutation in the MCP shell proteins downregulated the expression of genes related to pathogenicity. Overall, this study sheds new light on understanding the relationship between EA metabolism and bacterial physiology that would pave the way for developing novel therapeutic interventions against Salmonella.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

We used two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of neurons in the mouse visual cortex. Zebra noise elicited strong re-sponses that were more repeatable than those evoked by traditional stimuli. The wavelet-based model captured the repeatable aspects of the resulting responses, providing measures of neuronal tuning for multiple stimulus features: position, orientation, size, spatial frequency, drift rate, and direction. The method proved efficient, requiring only 5 minutes of stimulus (re-peated 3 times) to characterize the tuning of thousands of neurons across visual areas.

By contrast, many skills are learned without external guidance, posing a challenge to RL's ability to account for self-directed learning. For instance, juvenile male zebra finches first memorize and then train themselves to reproduce the song of an adult male tutor through extensive practice. This process is believed to be guided by an internally computed assessment of performance quality, though the mechanism and development of this signal remain unknown. Here, we propose that, contrary to prevailing assumptions, tutor song memorization and performance assessment are subserved by the same neural circuit, one trained to predictively cancel tutor song. To test this hypothesis, we built models of a local forebrain circuit that learns to use contextual input from premotor regions to cancel tutor song auditory input via plasticity at different synaptic loci. We found that, after learning, excitatory projection neurons in these circuits exhibited population error codes signaling mismatches between the tutor song memory and birds' own performance, and these signals best matched experimental data when networks were trained with anti-Hebbian plasticity in the recurrent pathway through inhibitory interneurons. We also found that model learning proceeds in two stages, with an initial phase of sharpening error sensitivity followed by a fine-tuning period in which error responses to the tutor song are minimized. Finally, we showed that the error signal produced by this model can train a simple RL agent to replicate the spectrograms of adult bird songs. Together, our results suggest that purely local learning via predictive cancellation suffices for bootstrapping error signals capable of guiding self-directed learning of natural behaviors.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

All behavioural processes increased visitation to treated patches, though their magnitude and context differed. Crop preference consistently elevated visitation rates, ISI use amplified nectar foraging on nearby crops when combined with preference, and pesticide-induced bias in foraging behaviour strongly increased pollen visits across distances.

Clarifying the lesion patterns that precipitate loss of consciousness can refine pathophysiological models and guide prognosis. Objectives: In this study, we aim to identify the brain regions most commonly affected in comatose AIS and determine whether specific combinations of lesions are necessary and sufficient to produce coma. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 476 AIS patients (52 comatose) using diffusion-weighted imaging. Infarcts were automatically segmented, manually verified, and normalized to MNI space. Support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping (SVR-LSM) quantified voxel-wise associations with coma, controlling for lesion volume. To assess the necessity and sufficiency of lesion combinations, we employed permutation-based nested logistic regression models comparing all subsets of four anatomical predictors: brainstem, thalamus, cerebellum, and the rest of brain lesions. Results: SVR-LSM revealed that coma was strongly associated with lesions involving the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum, whereas non-comatose patients exhibited predominantly cortical infarcts. Nested model comparisons showed that concurrent lesions to both the brainstem and thalamus were necessary and sufficient for coma. Additional involvement of the cerebellum or cerebral cortex did not improve predictive performance. Conclusions: Coma after AIS results from a dual-node subcortical lesion pattern involving both the brainstem and thalamus. Cerebellar and cortical lesions, even when extensive, did not induce coma in the absence of the dual-brainstem and thalamic lesions. These observations emphasize the predominant role of lesion location over lesion volume in the pathogenesis of coma. They also support mechanistic models that position the brainstem and thalamic hubs as central to the neural circuitry underlying arousal. Furthermore, these findings delineate a specific anatomical substrate that may serve as a strategic target for circuit-based neuroprotective and neuromodulatory therapies.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, little is known as to whether indirect or direct mPFC-LEC connections are critical for associative recognition memory and, if the latter, in which direction information travels. To address these questions, we first performed pharmacological disconnection of mPFC and LEC, finding that mPFC-LEC interaction is required for both memory encoding and retrieval. Next, we optogenetically inhibited projections from mPFC to LEC, showing that this projection was crucial for both encoding and retrieval of both object-in-place and object-in-context recognition memory when a 1 h, but not a 5 min, memory retention delay was used.

Key questions persist regarding the regionally specific nature of this transformation. Here, we present one of the most densely sampled early medieval datasets to date, enabling the reconstruction of a post-Roman polity at an unprecedented micro-regional resolution. Our integrated genetic and archaeological analysis of two Roman-period (n=68) and five post-Roman (n=246) sites from the Little Hungarian Plain, a former Roman frontier region, reveals a significant increase in Northern European genetic ancestry, likely reflecting a large-scale population movement into the region. Moreover, while all post-Roman sites, dated to the time of the Langobard Kingdom, share similar genetic profiles, burial practices, and material culture, they display distinct patterns of social organization, especially regarding the role that biological relatedness played in each community. Our results suggest that distinct social hierarchies might have existed between sites, and their intensive connectivity probably formed the basis for regional-level organisation within the post-Roman polity. Our study provides a framework for investigating how new polities take shape after the collapse of major political systems.

Individuals were randomly allowed access to, and learned to forage primarily from, one of five feeders. We then performed two reversals, manipulating social connections by either assigning birds to a new feeder with all others assigned to the same previous feeder (stable treatment) or reassigning each bird individually (unstable treatment). Learning was slower in the stable treatment and for individuals with higher weighted degree, suggesting effects of competition, and learning was faster in larger flocks, perhaps from reduced perceived predation risk. Scrounging increased with flock size and weighted degree. Foraging rate increased with weighted degree but was not influenced by social stability or flock size.

In a consortium effort analyzing 40 fMRI datasets (N=2,175), we examined the relationship between neural activation during reappraisal tasks and three core individual difference indices of reappraisal capabilities: (1) trait questionnaires, (2) task-based affective ratings, and (3) amygdala down-regulation. Strikingly, there was no shared overlap across these three common indices. Only a very weak correlation emerged between amygdala down-regulation and task-based affective ratings. Whole-brain analyses revealed no reliable neural associations with trait questionnaires, and associations with task-based affective ratings fell outside canonical emotion regulation networks (e.g., prefrontal circuitry). Moreover, amygdala down-regulation, often interpreted as a stable individual marker, was confounded by person-specific whole-brain responses - a limitation extending to fMRI research beyond the emotion regulation domain. These findings challenge the assumption that an individual's prefrontal activity is a valid indicator of their reappraisal capabilities and suggest that common trait, behavioral, and neural measures might capture distinct facets of emotion regulation.

However, it is unclear whether the preplanning of individual movements persists in continuous skilled actions that involve greater biomechanical integration and is associated with the formation of new motor primitives (neural fusion). We investigated how kinematics impact sequence planning in a handwriting-like task asking whether fusing velocity curves between adjacent movements affects movement preparation. Participants were trained and tested for two days to perform two sequences of four sequential centre-out-and-back movements from memory in a delayed sequence production task using a stylus on a Wacom tablet. To manipulate kinematic fusion between subsequent strokes, participants were assigned to one of three groups that were trained to perform the sequences either with acute, right or obtuse angles between sequential targets. Probe trials assessed the availability of constituent movement elements for fast and accurate execution towards each target during planning. Movement elements associated with later sequence positions were less available than earlier movements, regardless of kinematic fusion, in line with CQ findings for discrete typing sequences in humans. Importantly, a more pronounced CQ gradient was associated with higher fusion, faster initiation and greater accuracy of sequence production. These findings indicate that kinematically fused sequential actions do not result in the formation of new movement primitives (neural fusion) with a single movement plan. Instead, they continue to be planned separately and are associated with skilled performance.\n\nNew & NoteworthyUsing a handwriting-like sequencing task, we manipulated kinematic fusion through target geometry and examined the relative availability of individual movements towards targets as a marker of competitive queuing (CQ) during planning. Contrary to the assumption that behavioural fusion reflects their neural fusion of movements into a new motor primitive, we show that even under high levels of fusion, the underlying sequence elements remain competitively pre-ordered by their sequence position benefitting performance.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Principal component analysis identified a hypoxia-responsive FC component involving 400 cerebral parcels. This component emerged with a critical drop in PetO2 (~53 mmHg), preceding changes in SpO2, BOLD signals, and behavior. These FC changes were network-specific and centered on the default mode network (DMN), which selectively synchronized with other high-level cognitive networks.

A rapid emergence of predictive activity, where neural patterns of expected stimuli appear before their onset, precedes measurable behavioral improvements. This is followed by a much slower representational change, characterized by an increased neural pattern similarity between linked, non-adjacent elements. Both processes are supported by a distributed consortium of sensorimotor, dorsal attention, salience, central executive, and cerebellar networks.

This astounding property is because of steviol glycosides (SGs), a class of diterpenoid secondary metabolites which primarily consists of stevioside and rebaudioside A. These compounds are formed through a specific steviol glycoside (SG) biosynthetic pathway that contains several key genes. In the present work, gene expression profiling of 15 core genes of SG biosynthetic pathway, along with metabolite analysis were conducted in three groups of Stevia rebaudiana plants: In vitro regenerated non-transformed plantlets (NP), in vitro regenerated transformed plantlets (TP) via hairy root cultures using Rhizobium rhizogenes mediated transformation and Control plants (CP). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that in NP and TP there was upregulation of 13 genes. Both NP and TP showed downregulated SrDXR and SrCDPS in comparison to CP, whereas SrUGT74G1 had higher expression in NP than TP. HPLC chromatographic studies on SGs showed that stevioside content followed the order TP > NP > CP. These findings demonstrate that transformation enhances SG biosynthesis and support the use of genetically modified Stevia rebaudiana lines for increased natural sweetener production.

Eye blink rates were significantly lower during grooming compared to resting, suggesting increased attention during this cognitively more demanding task. Dominance rank difference and affiliative relationship strength between the groomer and groomee did not additionally influence eye blink rate. Blinking was timed to coincide with ingestion events during grooming, which may serve as explicit attentional breakpoints.

While recent studies support aGPCR activation via shedding of the extracellular GAIN domain, shedding-independent signaling mechanisms have also been observed. However, the molecular basis underlying these distinct activation modes remains poorly understood. Here, we integrate single-molecule force spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and cell-based assays to elucidate the structural and dynamic mechanisms of ADGRG1 mechanotransduction. We show that shear stress induces distinct deformation pathways in the isolated GAIN domain, promoting tethered agonist (TA) exposure through loop rearrangements prior to domain shedding. In the full-length receptor, defined GAIN orientations and specific loop contacts with the 7-transmembrane (7TM) core enable allosteric TA engagement and signaling in the absence of GAIN dissociation. The directionality of the applied force dictates the activation pathway, favoring either GAIN shedding or intact GAIN-7TM coupling. These mechanisms align with both the basal activity and collagen-enhanced signaling of ADGRG1. Using deep learning-guided design, we engineered GAIN variants with tailored mechanical sensitivity, validating our model through predictable shifts in constitutive and ligand-induced signaling. Together, our findings establish a unified framework for aGPCR activation governed by GAIN dynamics and orientation, bridging mechanical and allosteric models of receptor function and providing new strategies for engineering mechanosensitive receptors and precision therapeutics.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

We found a striking inverse correlation between baseline metabolic activity in matched normal tissues and the degree of metabolic rewiring in tumors, pointing to a context-dependent metabolic shift during oncogenesis. Our analysis reveals frequently upregulated glycosylation-related pathways across cancers, along with coordinated alterations in nucleotide, carbohydrate, amino acid, and coenzyme & cofactor metabolism that collectively support biosynthesis, maintain redox balance, and sustain oncogenic signaling. These changes enable cancer cells to proliferate rapidly, evade cell death, and adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions.

We investigated the effects of ER{beta} activation using diarylpropionitrile (DPN), a selective ER{beta} agonist, in both an in vivo model of post menopause and in vitro models of metabolic overload.

B.", "abstract": "Chemotherapeutic agents often cause DNA damage in order to kill fast-dividing cancer cells or disrupt their proliferation. Therefore, understanding the interplay between DNA damage and cell cycle progression is highly relevant for understanding cancer cell behaviour. An important regulator is transcription factor p53, primarily known for its function to maintain genomic stability, regulate transient and permanent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Activated p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of many proteins, among which are MDM2, p21 and BTG2. MDM2 functions as a direct inhibitor of p53 by targeting it for ubiquitination. The proteins p21 and BTG2 are known for their regulatory function in G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest. Using HepG2-FUCCI cells, we showed that exposure to cisplatin or etoposide caused a temporary G2 arrest. To study the link between protein expression and cell cycle arrest, we developed a mathematical model in which we integrated a previously established model for the protein expression dynamics of p53, MDM2, p21 and BTG2 with a cell cycle model. This allowed us to determine the importance of p21 and BTG2 in their stimulation of G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest. We found that the protein dynamics could predict the G2 cell cycle arrest in exposed cells, but only in combination with endoreplication, i.e., the alternation of S and G phases without mitosis, resulting in polyploid cells. Our model predicted that the majority of cells endoreplicate upon exposure to high concentrations of cisplatin and most concentrations of etoposide, which we validated with additional time-lapse imaging data in which we could track individual cells. In conclusion, polyploidisation is a generic response of HepG2 cells after treatment with DNA-damaging compounds.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

In humans, predictive coding has primarily been studied using oddball paradigms which rely on violations of stimulus probability based on recent sensory history. It was still unclear, however, whether humans exhibit visuomotor mismatch responses similar to those observed in mice. This question was important for two reasons. First, visuomotor mismatch responses in humans constitute a basis to start translating the mechanistic understanding of the circuit that computes these responses from mouse to human cortex. Second, a paradigm that can trigger strong prediction error responses and consequently requires shorter recording times would simplify experiments in a clinical setting. Here, by combining a wireless EEG recording system with virtual reality headset, we found robust visuomotor mismatch responses in human cortex that were characterized by a reversed polarity relative to visual evoked responses and a greater signal power than both visual responses and oddball mismatch responses.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

For candidate antibodies, we generate all possible k-mer peptides and compute hit rate by summing positive hits (+1.0) and negative hits (-0.2 penalty) normalized against total peptide number. Higher hit rate predicts lower ADA risk, with residue-level resolution enabling precise localization of immunogenic hotspots. ImmunoSeq demonstrated superior ADA correlation and humanness classification accuracy compared to deep learning models, while accurately predicts ADA reductions in humanization, enabling sufficient sequence optimization for humanness.

Although proliferative and differentiating tissues exhibit markedly different cell cycle dynamics, how these differences shape the histone modification landscape in vivo remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that levels of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 are tightly linked to cell cycle dynamics in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. We demonstrate that both physiological and pathological elongation of the cell cycle led to an accumulation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, whereas cell cycle acceleration reduces their levels. In contrast, H3K27ac exhibits the opposite pattern: levels decrease in arrested cells and increase with faster cycling. Genome-wide CUT&Tag analysis reveals that these changes predominantly affect genomic loci already modified in normally proliferating tissue. Importantly, the regulation of methylation levels at H3K9 and H3K27 is not solely mediated by the cell cycle machinery but reflects a metabolically guided process in which the rate of methylation is coupled to the rate of cell proliferation through metabolic activity, including signaling via the Insulin/PI3K/Akt pathway. Our study thus reveals key principles for understanding histone methylation in proliferating, senescent, and differentiating cells. In contrast, H3K27 acetylation is regulated through a distinct, cell cycle-coupled mechanism. We find that CBP/Nejire-mediated acetylation of H3K27 peaks during S-phase and is reversed by HDAC1, as cells exit replication. Disruption of this acetylation cycle leads to replication stress and a G2 cell cycle arrest via a DNA damage checkpoint. Notably, this genome-protective function of CBP/Nejire depends specifically on acetylation of the H3K27 residue itself, revealing a novel role for H3K27ac beyond its well-established function in transcriptional activation. Together, our findings establish a robust link between cell cycle progression and histone modification dynamics, highlighting the necessity of maintaining balanced PTM levels under varying proliferative states.

Because this type of isolation is environmentally mediated it can be ephemeral, for instance, if habitats change in response to climate. In contrast, intrinsic isolation is heritable and therefore loss of this type of isolation requires genetic changes in one or both populations. We performed a hybridization and backcross experiment to test for and characterize intrinsic reproductive isolation between two recently diverged, ecologically differentiated populations of Anolis lizards.

Here, we identify insulin signaling as a key mechanistic link between prenatal stress and long-term alterations in brain function and behavior. Using a validated rat model of prenatal adversity (prenatal food restriction, FR), we found that insulin administration selectively modulates gene expression in FR animals at P0, P21 and P90, affecting pathways involved in neurodevelopment and stress regulation, such as Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Targeted insulin infusion into the mPFC of adult animals reversed behavioral phenotypes induced by FR in a sex- and context-dependent manner, decreasing emotional reactivity to environmental cues.

While asymmetrical learning is a robust behavioral effect, the latent computations behind how animals represent their environments and use this to differentially weight wins and losses is poorly understood. Here we tested whether and how uncertainty and reward histories modulate the weights placed on wins and losses using a behavioral data set collected in rats. We propose a reinforcement learning model that integrates uncertainty history via an unsigned average reward prediction error and a separate subjective reward history component. We showed that in a dynamic probabilistic reversal learning task with blocks of variable reward predictability, ongoing estimation of uncertainty history and reward history both distinctly influenced rats sensitivity to wins and losses. In more predictable environments, and under low uncertainty levels, i.e., when rats were certain in making correct choices, rats weighted wins more than losses, as indicated by a higher win-stay, and lower lose-shift probability. This asymmetrical learning strategy enabled rats to remain with the correct action, while discounting the influence of rare losses. Further, male rats were more impacted by their reward history, i.e., environmental richness, when making lose-shift decisions, but conversely, female rats were more influenced by their uncertainty history. Hence, we found sex-specific contributions of these latent computations in modulating behavior. We overall demonstrate that asymmetrically weighting wins and losses could form an important behavioral strategy when adapting to ongoing changes in reward and uncertainty history.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

To test this, we investigated the relationship between nest asymmetry--defined by the side on which the nest opening is located--and external lateral structures using a database of 12,356 nest photographs taken by citizen scientists across the birds entire distribution. We found that in nests built in contact with a lateral structure, birds were more likely to place the nest entrance on the same side as the lateral structure than by chance.

We found an increased delay between membrane invagination and clathrin recruitment, reduced number of curved events, increased vesicle stability and an increase in the FTC model compared to control. As loss of actin filaments also reduces membrane tension, we treated Cos7 with high osmolality to decrease membrane tension and observed similar result with LatA treated group except vesicle stability stayed unchanged. This suggested the increased curved events in LatA groups may result from reduced membrane tension. We conclude actin polymerization promotes FTC while actin branching promotes vesicle formation though the CCM.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

I granted anticipatory abilities to Hamilton's selfish herd, a classic model of collective behaviour, using 14000 simulated populations and explored the consequences of this ability on collective movement patterns.

SLC26A11, a solute carrier with high expression levels in the brain, has been proposed to function as either an anion transporter or a channel. Here, we resolve this apparent discrepancy by demonstrating that SLC26A11 is a dual-function protein capable of operating as both a sulfate transporter and a chloride channel. By resolving its structure and combining biochemical studies and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that SLC26A11 exhibits all the hallmarks of a secondary transporter. The mechanistic basis for its selective ion transport identifies the protein as the elusive lysosomal sulfate exporter. Additionally, we demonstrate that SLC26A11 exhibits an uncoupled, channel-like chloride conductance gated by proton:sulfate symport. Our finding that the chloride-conducting state arises from the transport cycle may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating brain edema, and the identification of its role in lysosome sulfate efflux may provide new approaches to study and treat lysosomal storage diseases.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in spectroscopy and molecular biology have facilitated the development of genetically encoded vibrational probes like nitriles that can sensitively report on molecular interactions. Nitriles are powerful tools for measuring electrostatic environments within condensed media like proteins, but such measurements in live cells have been hindered by low signal-to-noise ratios. In this study, we design a spectrometer based on a double-beam quantum cascade laser (QCL)-based transmission infrared (IR) source with balanced detection that can significantly enhance sensitivity to nitrile vibrational probes embedded in proteins within cells compared to a conventional FTIR spectrometer. Using this approach, we detect small-molecule binding in E. coli, with particular focus on the interaction between para-coumaric acid (pCA) and nitrile-incorporated photoactive yellow protein (PYP). This system effectively serves as a model for investigating covalent drug binding in a cellular environment. Notably, we observe large spectral shifts of up to 15 cm-1 for nitriles embedded in PYP between the unbound and drug-bound states directly within bacteria, in agreement with observations for purified proteins. Such large spectral shifts are ascribed to the changes in the hydrogen-bonding environment around the local environment of nitriles, accurately modeled through high-level molecular dynamics simulations using the AMOEBA force field. Our findings underscore the QCL spectrometer's ability to enhance sensitivity for monitoring drug-protein interactions, offering new opportunities for advanced methodologies in drug development and biochemical research.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

K.; Vance, J.; Wang, S.", "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels initiate and propagate action potentials in many excitable cells. Upon repetitive activation, the fraction of Nav channels available for excitation gradually decreases on a timescale ranging from seconds to minutes, a phenomenon known as slow inactivation. This process is crucial for regulating cellular excitability and firing patterns. Slow inactivation is proposed to result from the collapse of the selectivity filter pore coupled with the opening of the primary helix bundle crossing gate. However, the conformational changes underlying slow inactivation and the molecular coupling between the selectivity filter and primary gate remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the conformational dynamics of the selectivity filter in prokaryotic NavAb channels reconstituted into liposomes using single-molecule FRET (smFRET). Our smFRET data revealed the conformational transitions in the NavAb selectivity filter pore among three distinct states, with activating voltages enriching the high-FRET conformations, potentially associated with slow inactivation. Using electrophysiological and crystallographic methods, we further identified the L176 residue in the selectivity filter P1 helix as a critical coupler between the primary and slow inactivation gates. We showed that L176 mutations with side chains of larger sizes significantly facilitated the slow inactivation of the NavAb channel, and the L176F mutation forced the opening mutant carrying the C-terminal deletion to be crystallized at the closed state. Consistently, our smFRET results revealed that C-terminal deletion markedly attenuated the high FRET conformation of the selectivity filter, which was restored by the L176F mutation. Moreover, using the classical Nav open-pore blocker lidocaine, we showed that it also depleted the high FRET conformation of the NavAb selectivity filter in a dose-dependent manner. The L176F mutation, again, markedly reversed the conformational shifts caused by lidocaine, an effect similar to it on the opening mutant carrying the C-terminal deletion. Our studies consistently suggested that slow inactivation in the NavAb channel is underlined by the collapse of the selectivity filter pore, represented by the high FRET conformation uncovered by our smFRET measurements, while the L176 residue at the P1 helix of the selectivity filter and T206 at the pore lining helix couple the conformational changes of the slow inactivation gate at selectivity filter and the primary gate at the helix bundle crossing.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

The detection of small RNA, such as miRNA, using solid-state nanopores typically involves the binding of miRNA to a larger carrier molecule to generate signals. However, this approach is entropically unfavourable, and it is prone to RNAse degradation in the environment leading to accidental digestion of miRNA prior to analysis. Here, we present an alternative approach based on DNA origami disassembly driven by toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD). Symmetrical DNA origami dimers are separated into monomers via TMSD using miRNAs as invading strands. We visualized the real-time dynamics of dimer separation at high resolution using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM), providing direct insight into the kinetic of the TMSD process. The entropically driven disassembly process can be followed using single molecule nanopore sensing leading to a quantitative readout of the ratio of dimers to monomers. This direct read-out method enabled the multiplexed detection of miRNAs. Due to the near irreversible process of the TMSD, we performed the detection of miRNA in crude RNA tissue extracts under the presence of RNAse and showed that our approach allowed the robust detection of small RNA that is unaffected by the complex degrading environment.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Ubiquitously expressed throughout the body of vertebrate animals, this pentameric ligand-gated ion channel participates in a wide range of physiological phenomena - as diverse as synaptic transmission and the control of excessive inflammation - and is an attractive therapeutic target for novel ligands. Although notable efforts have been made to understand this receptor-channel in terms of function and structure, many questions remain unanswered despite the molecular simplicity of its homomeric assembly. Recent cryo-EM studies have provided atomic models of this channel in different conformations, thus enabling the application of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to the study of cation conduction. We perform both single-channel patch-clamp recordings and MD simulations on the 7-nAChR. MD simulations of an 7-nAChR model (PDB ID 7KOX) reproduced the measured single-channel conductance and revealed Poissonian ion permeation, which we further modelled as a double-Poisson process incorporating inter-event delay times. We found that cations can enter the channel through lateral fenestrations in the extracellular domain although the probability of ions following this lateral pathway - rather than the axial one - is much lower than observed in simulations of other Cys-loop receptors. We also examined other atomic models (PDB ID 7EKT and 8V80) of the 7-nAChR proposed to represent partially open states of the channel and found them to be non-conductive.

Other migraine-inducing agents such as nitric oxide (NO) donors, CGRP, and PACAP are thought to activate second messengers leading to KATP opening. Yet, how KATP channel opening leads to migraine remains unclear. Here, we investigated the contribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms and downstream signaling cascades in a mouse model of migraine-relevant tactile hypersensitivity induced by repeated administration of levcromakalim. The non-selective NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) effectively prevented levcromakalim-induced hypersensitivity. Gene expression analysis in the dura mater suggested contributions from endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). Semi-selective nNOS inhibition with S-methyl-L-Thiocitrulline (SMTC) or genetic deletion of neuronal NOS (nNOS) had minimal effect on hypersensitivity and no effect on vasodilation. In contrast, eNOS-/- mice were partially protected from levcromakalim-induced hypersensitivity and exhibited impaired vascular response, highlighting eNOS as a key mediator. Inhibition of iNOS with S-methylisothiourea (SMT) revealed a possible contribution from iNOS as well. Surprisingly, inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) had no effect, while the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FeTPPS partially attenuated hypersensitivity, implicating nitrosative stress - rather than classical NO-sGC-cGMP signaling - as the critical downstream pathway. We propose that levcromakalim induces both coupled and uncoupled eNOS activity, enhanced NO production and generation of reactive nitrogen species, including peroxynitrite.

Anti-inflammatory treatments utilizing glucocorticosteroid regimens may induce glaucoma by chronically elevating IOP via increased trabecular meshwork (TM) resistance to the flow of aqueous humor, but it is not known whether pressure transduction itself is impacted by steroids and how changes in TM mechanosignaling affect conventional outflow resistance and IOP. To address this, we investigated the role of TREK-1 (TWIK-related potassium channel-1), a mechanosensitive K+ channel, in regulation of outflow facility, transmembrane signaling and dexamethasone (DEX)-induced ocular hypertension (OHT). The expression of tandem-pore potassium channels in mouse TM cells was dominated by Trek-1 (Kcnk2) mRNA, with residual expression of Traak, Tresk2 and Twik3 and vanishingly low levels of Task1 and Trek2. DEX suppressed Trek1 transcription by ~80% but did not affect expression of Trpv4 and Piezo1 genes. Chronic DEX administration depolarized the membrane potential of TM cells and elevated IOP in mice whereas the selective TREK-1 agonist ML-402 lowered IOP in rodent OHT models. ML-402 doubled the outflow facility in perfused mouse eyes at all applied pressures and hyperpolarized DEX-treated TM cells. These in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo results implicate TREK-1 channels in homeostatic regulation of TM mechanosignaling, conventional outflow regulation and IOP homeostasis. Suppression of TREK-1 signaling by corticosteroids underlies OHT and could contribute to steroid glaucoma but this can be obviated by pharmacological stimulation of the channel with cornea-permeant ML-402 eye drops.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

In this study, we evaluated three different expression constructs in two different horticultural types of lettuce using the non-invasive RUBY reporter, which allowed for the monitoring of transgene expression throughout the process of regeneration during tissue culture, throughout development of the primary transgenics, and in two subsequent sexual generations. The LsUBI promoter/terminator combination resulted in strong, uniform expression throughout regeneration, during growth of the primary transgenics, and in both subsequent generations. The AtUBI promoter/tRBCS combination showed slightly lower levels of expression and intermediate levels of silencing, while the 35S promoter/tHSP combination showed both initial strong expression and frequent silencing.

We report that the stiffness-sensing role of tarsi is mediated through external sensory organs housed, namely ventral mechanosensory bristles and subsets of campaniform sensilla present primarily at the joints between tarsomeres. Our findings provide new evidence that campaniform sensilla function as indirect stiffness sensors of oviposition substrates, owing to their placement at joints that experience maximal cuticular distortion. We show that Painless is expressed in mechanosensory neurons innervating peripheral organs where it likely participates in the transduction of stiffness-evoked stimuli. Furthermore, we observed that overexpression of painless in both campaniform sensilla and mechanosensory bristles partially rescues preference for the softer substrates in painless mutants, indicating that painless activity in these organs is necessary to mediate the preference.

Using Citrobacter rodentium, a murine-specific A/E pathogen, we disrupted both GlcNAc and NeuNAc catabolism by deleting nagA, which encodes the GlcNAc-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6P) deacetylase that converts GlcNAc-6P into glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P). The {Delta}nagA mutant displayed dramatically impaired colonization in C57BL/6J mice and accumulated significant levels of GlcNAc-6P, unlike the {Delta}manastrain, a mutant lacking all GlcNAc and NeuNAc transporters, suggesting that the attenuation was due to sugar-phosphate stress rather than nutrient deprivation alone. Supplementation with glucosamine (GlcN) restored growth, indicating that dysregulated GlcN-6P synthesis, rather than GlcNAc-6P toxicity, underlies the defect. Furthermore, {Delta}nagA exhibited increased susceptibility to several cell wall-dependent stress conditions, in concert with compromised peptidoglycan biosynthesis due to reduced UDP-GlcNAc synthesis.

In contrast, pnd-2 exhibited a transient expression peak independent of DH-signal and was unaffected by HCl treatment. RNAi-mediated knockdown of either gene inhibited the diapause initiation, and injection of pnd mRNA into non-diapause-destined eggs induced a diapause-like state in embryos.

In this study, we investigated the role of Spalt Like Transcription Factor 4 (SALL4), an onofetal transcription factor, in both malignant and regenerative HC fate transitions toward the biliary lineage. Using Sleeping Beauty hydrodynamic tail vein injection-mediated murine liver cancer models, we explored HC-to-CCA transformation, while the DDC diet-induced cholestasis model was used to investigate regenerative HC-to-CC reprogramming. Our findings reveal that SALL4 is specifically required for myristoylated Akt (myrAkt)-YAP1S127A (AY)-driven HC-to-CCA transformation, as its loss significantly suppressed malignant reprogramming and clonal expansion. Surprisingly, SALL4 overexpression also prevented AY-driven CCA development while promoting the expansion of liver progenitor cell (LPC)-like fatty HCs. Mechanistically, we propose Bmi1 as a key downstream effector of SALL4 in YAP1-dependent HC-to-CCA transformation. Additionally, in the DDC-fed cholestasis model, Sall4 deletion enhanced HC-to-LPC activation while impairing LPC differentiation into mature CCs. These findings establish SALL4 as a critical regulator of HC plasticity in both malignant and regenerative contexts and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for specific liver cancer subtypes.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

However, previous studies have been limited by a small number of muscle biopsies, often collected at arbitrary time points post-exercise, and in predominantly male subjects. Using the most comprehensive skeletal muscle biopsy time course following a single session of exercise in both males and females, we identified over 16,600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including more than 7,000 novel exercise-responsive genes. Of these DEGs, the magnitude of differential expression in 60% of genes was influenced by cardiorespiratory fitness. Although most mitochondrial genes were differentially expressed after exercise, the majority were downregulated at 24-48 hours, suggesting that mitochondrial protein expression may be regulated by post-transcriptional regulation. Despite 1,193 genes showing sex-specific expression at baseline, exercise-induced gene expression differences were minimal between males and females, suggesting that when cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise stimulus are matched, skeletal muscle adaptations are similar between sexes. To enhance data accessibility, we created a Shiny app (https://BishopLab.shinyapps.io/EXERgene/) that allows users to investigate specific genes and interrogate potential mechanisms of skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

At non-immunosuppressive doses, these drugs are senomorphic, i.e. they mitigate cellular senescence, but whether they protect genome stability itself has been unclear. Given that DNA damage is a major driver of immune ageing, and immune decline accelerates whole-organism ageing, we tested whether mTOR inhibition enhances genome stability. In human T cells exposed to acute genotoxic stress, we found that rapamycin and other mTOR inhibitors suppressed senescence not by slowing protein synthesis, halting cell division, or stimulating autophagy, but by directly reducing DNA lesional burden and improving cell survival. Ex-vivo analysis of aged immune cells from healthy donors revealed a stark enrichment of markers for DNA damage, senescence, and mTORC hyperactivation, suggesting that human immune ageing may be amenable to intervention by low-dose mTOR inhibition. To test this in vivo, we conducted a placebo-controlled experimental medicine trial in older adults administered with low-dose rapamycin. p21, a marker of DNA damage-induced senescence, was significantly reduced in immune cells from the rapamycin compared to placebo group. These findings reveal a previously unrecognised role for mTOR inhibition: direct genoprotection. This mechanism may help explain rapamycin's exceptional geroprotective profile and opens new avenues for its use in contexts where genome instability drives pathology, ranging from healthy ageing, clinical radiation exposure, and even the hazards of cosmic radiation in space travel.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Sepsis and infection mortality are associated with excessive glycolysis-induced inflammation, impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and loss of disease tolerance. Reduced glucose intake can reverse these dysregulations, but it is unclear how the mechanistic control of glycolysis-OXPHOS balance drives defense strategies and infection outcomes. Here, in a preterm piglet model of neonatal sepsis, glycolysis inhibition with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) completely prevents acute infection mortality, reduces systemic inflammation and markers of liver injury, accompanied by enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and disease tolerance. Strikingly, this protection by 2-DG is conferred despite elevated blood glucose levels and higher bacterial burdens than the infected controls. Alternatively, partial replacement of glucose intake with the ketone beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) abolishes sepsis-related mortality via improving disease tolerance and clinical parameters. This intervention also shifts the hepatic transcriptome away from inflammatory signaling and towards mitochondrial metabolism. In macrophages in vitro, BHB also exerts anti-inflammatory effects independently of metabolic modulation via the HCAR2 receptor. Finally, data from a cohort of 700 infants confirm an association of plasma BHB levels and anti-inflammatory state. These findings demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming through glycolysis inhibition or ketone supplementation is a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance disease tolerance and improve sepsis outcomes in neonates.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Intestinal schistosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa and the Neotropics is caused primarily by Schistosoma mansoni and is transmitted by several Biomphalaria planorbid snail species. Adult male and female parasites in the definitive mammalian host pair and reside in the mesenteric vasculature; females lay eggs that traverse the intestinal wall to be excreted, but a significant proportion become trapped in host tissues, especially the liver, eliciting granulomatous immune responses that underlie most disease pathology. S. mansoni is the primary lab model for research and, due to the abundance and ease of harvesting, liver-derived eggs are almost exclusively used to maintain the life cycle and to study miracidia and subsequent larval stages. However, recent evidence shows that eggs from the liver or intestine have key morphometric, transcriptomic, and antigenic differences, which can profoundly affect experimental outcomes. To determine whether these differences extend to the miracidia stage, we compared miracidia hatched from mouse liver and intestine-derived eggs, sequencing their transcriptomes and assessing their unstimulated behaviors over time in an arena allowing for high-resolution tracking of miracidia behavior at a large spatiotemporal scale. We found that while transcriptomic profiles of miracidia are distinguishable based on egg tissue origin, only a small subset of genes is differentially expressed. Further, basic, unstimulated behavior of miracidia that developed in different niches of the definitive host was significantly different. These different behavioral programs may reflect intrinsic developmental programming or differential viability and hardiness related to tissue origin. These findings underscore the importance of egg source in experimental design and interpretation, with significant implications for the maintenance of laboratory life cycles and the use of miracidia in schistosomiasis research.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we implemented in vivo Parallelized Reporter Assays in C. elegans neurons and muscle cells to screen for intronic enhancer and silencer motifs among thousands of randomized sequences. We identified nearly 200 sequences regulating splicing in these tissues. We uncovered core sub-sequences with tissue-biased enhancing and silencing activity, including motifs recognized by well-characterized RNA-binding proteins, and orphan motifs with no obvious cognate binding protein. Mapping our PRA-derived motifs to native introns flanking tissue-biased alternative exons revealed their conservation across nematodes, supporting their functional relevance.

Here, we delineate the role of SphK1 in modulating host-pathogen interactions using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and pharmacological inhibition in THP-1 macrophages. We generated and validated CRISPR constructs targeting SphK1 (promoter, SBS, exon 6) and SphK2 (exon 3). SphK1 Knockout was confirmed at transcript and protein levels, accompanied by a marked reduction in SphK1 enzymatic activity and S1P levels. Functionally, SphK1 knockout macrophages exhibited decreased intracellular L. donovani burden, elevated TNF-, and reduced IL-10, and increased autophagic and apoptotic markers, suggesting a pro-inflammatory, cell-death-prone state. Pharmacological inhibition using the selective SphK1 inhibitor, PF-543 recapitulated these findings, showing reduced phosphorylated SphK1, enhanced p38MAPK activation, and augmented autophagy and apoptosis.

To do this, we average the gel displacement data under an axisymmetric assumption to extract radial strain profiles that reliably reveal local deformations of the gel. By analyzing gels of varying shapes, we further show that our method extends robustly to gels that are not completely circular or that do not displace symmetrically towards their geometric center. The analysis reveals common underlying features in the radial profiles of gel deformation. These strain profiles will allow the inference of the spatial and orientational distribution of motor-generated active stresses with appropriate constitutive models for the gel mechanics.

As Leishmania are purine auxotrophs and lack de novo synthesis, ectoenzymes facilitating nucleotide and nucleic acid cleavage are indispensable for subsequent uptake. Employing quantitative proteomics, we identified a class I nuclease p1/s1 cluster in L. major that comprises enzymes exhibiting dual 3'-nucleotidase and endonuclease activity. Expression of these enzymes is induced upon miltefosine or staurosporine treatment and was specifically detected in stationary-phase, but not in logarithmic-phase promastigotes. After confirming secretion of p1/s1, ecto-enzymatic activity was detected on parasites and in the culture supernatant. Viable null mutants deficient for the p1/s1 cluster were only obtained when a diCre-based inducible knockout system was applied, whereas direct deletion approaches were lethal. The viable knockout strains exhibited significantly reduced 3'-nucleotidase/nuclease activity. Notably, these parasites adapted by compensatory enrichment of various alternative purine salvage proteins at the proteomic level. Furthermore, both enzymatic functions implied mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions to facilitate infection establishment: Utilizing 3'-nucleotidase activity, Leishmania generate extracellular adenosine to suppress inflammatory cytokine secretion from macrophages and reduce lymphocyte proliferation in a human primary cell model. The presence of ecto-nucleases also allowed these parasites to degrade and survive neutrophil extracellular traps, a potent first-line innate immune mechanism in pathogen defense. In summary, our integrative approach combining proteomics, immunological and genome editing methods expands current knowledge about Leishmania major 3'-nucleotidases/nucleases.

Here, we show that full- length Drosophila kinesin-1 generates striking spatiotemporal patterns in gliding assays including bending, looping, and oscillations as well as stop-and-go motion of filaments. In presence of the motor domain alone these patterns are absent, but with the tail only construct, microtubules bind passively, with the tail acting as a static anchor. An equimolar mixture of these two domain constructs reproduces these spatio-temporal patterns both in terms of increased bending with length and velocity distributions. Our results support a simple 'coin-toss' model, where either head or tail bind microtubules with equal probability, leading to antagonistic interactions that drives emergent motility patterns and velocity distributions.

The role of this connection in regulating glucose metabolism remains unknown. Here we identify and functionally characterize a subpopulation of nitridergic myenteric neurons in the proximal duodenum that project directly to the pancreas. The anatomical and transcriptomic signature of these neurons places them downstream of glutamatergic and enkephalinergic enteric interneurons that indirectly respond to luminal nutrient stimuli. Their axonal projections to the pancreas contact neuro-insular ganglia and reach into the islet parenchyma.

A drawback of this approach is that likelihoods can easily become computationally intractable, limiting our ability to extend current diversification models with new hypothesized mechanisms. Neural networks have been proposed as a likelihood-free alternative for parameter inference of stochastic models, but so far there is little experience in using this method for diversification models, and the quality of the results is likely to depend on finding the right network architecture and data representation. As phylogenies are essentially graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) appear to be the most natural architecture but previous results on their performance are conflicting, with some studies reporting poor accuracy of GNNs in practice. Here, we show that this underperformance was likely caused by optimization issues and inappropriate pooling operations that flatten the information along the phylogeny and make it harder to extract relevant information about the diversification parameters. When equipped with PhyloPool, a new time-informed pooling procedure, GNNs show similar or better performance compared to all other architectures and data representations (including Maximum Likelihood Estimation) that we tested for two common diversification models, the Constant Rate Birth-Death and the Binary State Speciation and Extinction.

We previously developed a modular cloning (MoClo) based toolkit for S. cerevisiae that facilitates rapid optimization of signal peptides and anchor proteins for efficient secretion and/or surface display of heterologous proteins of interest. Here we describe further improvements and applications of this yeast secretion and display (YSD) toolkit. New parts encoding anchor proteins based on N-terminal fusion to a truncated Aga1 and C-terminal fusion to Aga2, each with three possible epitope tag options, are described. We also added parts that facilitate high throughput detection of secreted proteins of interest through GFP fluorescence complementation and parts encoding secretion boosting yeast proteins, whose overexpression has previously been reported to enhance secretion of heterologous proteins. In addition, two surface display applications of the toolkit are showcased. We demonstrate that yeast surface display of an anti-GFP nanobody allows cost-effective evaluation of the interactions of GFP-tagged proteins of interest, either by flow cytometry or yeast-based co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, using yeast cells as whole-cell catalysts, we show that co-display of the poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) degrading enzyme leaf-branch compost cutinase with hydrophobin1 enhances the breakdown of PET plastic, while triple co-display of these proteins with MHETase causes complete conversion of the intermediary monohydroxy-ethyl-terephthalate (MHET) to terephthalic acid. The diverse applications described herein demonstrate the broad applications of the updated MoClo YSD toolkit 2.0 in both synthetic biology and other research fields.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Using sediment traps and other ecosystem measurements, we quantified sinking organic matter flux and investigated the characteristics of sinking particles in waters overlying the Argo Abyssal Plain directly downstream of the Indonesian Throughflow off northwest Australia. Carbon export from the euphotic zone averaged 7.0 mmol C m-2 d-1, which equated to an average export efficiency (export / net primary production) of 0.17. Sinking particle flux within the euphotic zone (beneath the mixed layer, but above the deep chlorophyll maximum) averaged slightly higher than flux at the base of the euphotic zone, suggesting that the deep euphotic zone was a depth stratum of net particle remineralization. Carbon flux attenuation continued into the twilight zone with a transfer efficiency (export at euphotic depth + 100m / export at euphotic depth) of 0.62 and an average Martin's b-value of 1.1. Within the euphotic zone, fresh phytoplankton (chlorophyll associated with sinking particles, possibly contained within appendicularian houses) were an important component of sinking particles, but beneath the euphotic zone the fecal pellets of herbivorous zooplankton (phaeopigments) were more important. Changes in carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition with depth further reflected remineralization processes occurring as particles sank. We show similarities with biological carbon pump functioning in a similar semi-enclosed oligotrophic marginal sea, the Gulf of Mexico, including net remineralization across the deep chlorophyll maximum.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

DeepDiff-SHAP integrates SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to estimate conditional dependencies and perform nonlinear differential causal inference in a principled, interpretable manner. Applying DeepDiff-SHAP to two population-scale datasets, the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset and a UK Biobank sepsis cohort stratified by hypertension, we identified clinically meaningful and subgroup-specific causal changes in relationships between features such as age, general health, alkaline phosphatase, and cholesterol. Our results demonstrate that deep learning enhances sensitivity to complex interaction patterns overlooked by linear models, providing new biological insights into disease progression and comorbidity-specific risk mechanisms.

Bacteriophage {lambda} Cro is a 66-residue repressor that binds DNA as a dimer to block transcription. Because of its small size, simple structure, and well-characterized function, Cro has long served as a model system for understanding the structure/function relationship in transcription factors. Experiments have shown that a small set of mutations can convert it into a dual-function transcription factor capable of both repression and activation. One engineered variant retains activity when truncated to 63 amino acids but loses function at 59, highlighting how little sequence is required for complex regulatory behavior. To probe the molecular basis of this adaptability, we performed multi-microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type Cro and two engineered variants, Act3 and Act8. The simulations reveal that minimal sequence changes can reorganize interaction surfaces, shift DNA-binding modes, modulate binding affinities, and redistribute intramolecular communication pathways. These effects on DNA binding occur alongside changes that may broaden regulatory potential, offering insight into how compact transcription factors evolve new functions. Together, these observations provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how transcription factor sequence, structure, and dynamics reshape gene regulatory function.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Existing models have focused on LUAD from predominantly smoker populations, with limited molecular scope and variable performance. Here, we propose a customized deep convolutional neural network based on ResNet50 architecture, optimized for multilabel classification for NS-LUAD, enabling simultaneous prediction of 16 molecular alterations from a single H&E-stained WSI. Key architectural modifications included a simplified two-layer residual block without bottleneck layers, selective shortcut connections, and a sigmoid-based classification head for independent prediction of each alteration, designed to reduce computational complexity while maintaining predictive accuracy. The model was trained and evaluated on 495 WSIs from the Sherlock-Lung study (70% training with 10% internal test set for 10-fold cross-validation, and 30% held-out validation set for final evaluation). For the held-out validation data, our model achieved high areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] values =0.84-0.93 for detecting 11 features: EGFR, KRAS, TP53, RBM10 mutations, MDM2 amplification, kataegis, CDKN2A deletion, ALK fusion, whole-genome doubling, and EGFR hotspot mutations (p.L858R and p.E746_A750del).

However, lesion studies in humans examining amygdala function have largely focused on its role in processing fear. It currently remains unclear what causal role the human amygdala plays in more complex emotion, motivation and learning processes in daily life. This is because it has not been possible to reversibly modulate amygdala activity non-invasively in humans. Here, we used transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TUS) to bilaterally perturb neural activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). In separate sessions (n = 87), 29 healthy volunteers received offline-TUS to bilateral BLA, mid-insula or sham before playing a novel emotional learning task validated in an independent large cohort online (n = 210). 7T-resting-state and metabolite signals clearly demonstrated target engagement. BLA-TUS reduced the BLA's connectivity fingerprint and decreased its excitation/inhibition balance, suggesting an inhibitory effect of our TUS protocol on BLA activity. In behaviour, BLA-TUS caused a stimulation volume-dependent increase in the tendency to approach neutral, emotionally ambiguous faces, treating them more similarly to happy faces, and a slowing of reaction times for those two emotion categories. These effects were functionally and regionally specific and suggest a causal role for the amygdala in resolving emotional ambiguity. Our results provide important insights for future studies into mood disorders where ambiguous situations might be harder to resolve, which could contribute to existing emotional and learning biases.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Animal studies suggest that positive and negative emotions are separately encoded by distinct neuronal populations within the amygdala; however, this hypothesis has rarely been tested in humans. The current study examined this hypothesis by comparing the distributed emotion encoding model, as proposed in animal studies, with the univariate emotion encoding model using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging. More specifically, we applied univariate regression, using average amygdala activation to represent global activation level, and multivariate regression, using distributed voxel-level pattern within the amygdala, to predict normative valence of affective images from the IAPS library. In the core amygdala, the multivariate model prediction performance was not better than that of the univariate model, with weight map analysis revealing an overwhelming predominance of voxels selectively responsive to negative stimuli. When the region of interest was expanded to include voxels with lower anatomical probability of belonging to the amygdala as well as voxels from adjacent areas, the multivariate model significantly outperformed the univariate model, with the voxels selectively responsive to positive valence primarily located in regions surrounding the core amygdala. These findings suggest that in the human amygdala, the core region encodes emotional valence primarily through a global activation signal, rather than distributed patterns consisting of separate clusters of positive and negative voxels, and a more distributed valence representation emerges when voxels surrounding the amygdala are taken into consideration.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Olfactory anhedonia in depressed patients results in a decreased attraction to pleasant smells and increased aversion to unpleasant odors. We used the Unpredictable Chronic Mild Stress (UCMS) as an induced-depression model to study olfactory perception and avoidance in mice of both sexes. After inducing a depression-like state, we observed an increased sensitivity to aversive odorants as well as an associated increase in escape behavior in an odorized environment. Previous studies using a similar model of induced depression have demonstrated increased neuroinflammation in brain areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex, but few have explored the effects in olfactory processing centers. We used immunohistochemistry to measure changes in astrocytic activation and microglia in multiple olfactory regions of the brain to further investigate the connection between neuroinflammation and odor hypersensitivity. We found an increase in the number of astrocytes in the medial amygdala, which receives direct input from the accessory olfactory bulb, and more complex microglial morphology in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex. Additional analysis revealed a relationship between the extent of neuroinflammation and odor aversion.

This study investigates how fire severity and recency affect fungal communities and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) seedling performance, and whether live-soil inoculation or stress priming improve post-fire outcomes. Methods In a greenhouse experiment, Douglas-fir seedlings were grown in soils from high-severity burns, recent and historic low-severity burns, and unburned sites in the Sierra Nevada. Each soil was applied as a live or autoclaved inoculum. Drought stress and abscisic acid priming treatments were imposed before a final 3-week dry-down. We measured seedling biomass, chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), EMF colonization, and fungal community composition using ITS amplicon sequencing. Results High-severity soils reduced seedling growth, EMF colonization, and fungal richness. Low-severity burns supported more rich, diverse fungal communities and greater seedling performance. Stress priming treatments had minimal effects. Fungal community composition varied significantly by burn severity. Conclusion Fire severity drives changes in fungal community structure that influence seedling outcomes. Low-severity soils retain beneficial microbial legacies, supporting stronger mycorrhizal associations that result in seedling performance comparable to unburned soils.

We therefore assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, peripheral immune cell profiles, autoantibody profiles and circulating cytokines for up to 6 months in participants with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who either convalesced or developed PASC. Compared to convalescent, PASC participants with a broad range of PASC phenotypes exhibited persistently elevated IgG titers for SARS-CoV-2 Envelope and Nucleocapsid proteins over the 6 months of study duration. In contrast, the IgG responses to Spike protein were significantly lower in the PASC cohort with predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 class-switched bias. Using CyTOF analysis, we show elevated numbers of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH) and mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAIT), which also correlated with high anti-Envelope IgG titers. Persistent immune activation was accompanied by augmented serum cytokine profiles with LIF, IL-11, Eotaxin-3, and HMGB-1 in PASC participants, who also demonstrated significantly higher rates of autoantibodies.

HIV latent reservoir maintenance is a major challenge for ART therapy, especially when immune pressure is waning.

Recent studies have pointed out that S proteins may activate the mTOR signaling pathway, which in turn affects the immune response and metabolic processes of cells. The mTOR pathway is closely related to the maintenance and activation of HIV latent reservoir. However, how S proteins affect the HIV latent reservoir and the mechanism of activation are unclear. To explore the mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 S proteins regulate the HIV latent reservoir and to explore whether S proteins regulate the HIV latent reservoir through the mTOR pathway, we constructed an in vitro HIV latent reservoir model for our experiments.To evaluate the potential role of S protein in HIV latent reservoir activation, relevant markers of HIV latent reservoir activation were detected using ELISA, flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR; and the relationship between S protein and mTOR was also detected by WB, CO-IP, and IFC.It was found that S proteins activated the HIV latent reservoir while increasing mTOR expression.

However, their sustained protective efficacies were limited by relatively short-lived antibody responses and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, necessitating frequent and variant-updated boosters. We recently developed the ESCRT- and ALIX-binding region (EABR) mRNA vaccine platform, which encodes engineered immunogens that induce budding of enveloped virus-like particles (eVLPs) from the plasma membrane, thereby resulting in presentation of immunogens on cell surfaces and eVLPs. Prior studies showed that spike (S)-EABR mRNA-LNP immunizations elicited enhanced neutralizing antibody responses against ancestral and variant SARS-CoV-2 compared with conventional S mRNA-LNP in naive mice, but the effectiveness of S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosters in the context of pre-existing immunity has not been investigated. Here, we evaluated monovalent Wuhan-Hu-1 (Wu1) and bivalent (Wu1/BA.5) S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosters in mice pre-vaccinated with conventional Wu1 S mRNA-LNP. Compared to conventional S mRNA-LNP boosters, the EABR approach enhanced monovalent and bivalent mRNA-LNP booster-induced neutralizing responses against Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.5, BQ.1.1, and XBB.1, with bivalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP consistently eliciting the highest titers. Epitope mapping of polyclonal antisera by deep mutational scanning revealed that bivalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosted diverse polyclass anti-RBD responses, suggesting balanced targeting of multiple RBD epitope classes. In contrast, monovalent S, bivalent S, and monovalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosters elicited less diverse polyclonal serum responses primarily targeting immunodominant RBD epitopes. Cryo-EM structures demonstrated that bivalent mRNA immunizations promote S heterotrimer formation, potentially enhancing bivalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP booster-induced antibody breadth and polyclass epitope targeting by activating cross-reactive B cells through intra-S crosslinking. These findings support the future design of bivalent or multivalent S-EABR mRNA-LNP boosters as a promising strategy to confer broader, and therefore potentially more durable, protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other rapidly evolving viruses.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

The spike mutations that most affect serum antibody neutralization sometimes differ between sera collected before versus after recent vaccination or infection, indicating these exposures shift the neutralization immunodominance hierarchy. The sites where mutations cause the greatest reduction in neutralization by post-vaccination or infection sera include receptor-binding domain (RBD) sites 475, 478 and 487, all of which have mutated in recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Multiple mutations outside the RBD affect sera neutralization as strongly as any RBD mutations by modulating RBD up/down movement.

Emerging variants of concern (VOCs) with enhanced transmissibility and improved immune evasion may compromise the efficacy of current antiviral and immunotherapies, necessitating comprehensive investigations into the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The conformational dynamics of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 spike and the presentation of neutralizing antibody epitopes influence viral transmission and infection rates. In this study, we have identified highly conserved non-RBM epitopes for two potent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), TAU-1109 and TAU-2310, isolated from convalescent human patients, which contribute to the broad neutralizing activity of these mAbs against all the circulating VOCs, including the recently emerged Omicron subvariants. We employed high-resolution structural data in conjunction with systematic biochemical investigation to elucidate the neutralization mechanism of TAU-1109 and TAU-2310. The mechanism involves antibody-mediated destabilization of the spike trimer, resulting in the premature shedding of the S1 subunit and rendering the spike incapable of mediating host cell entry.

This task is complicated by epistasis, i.e., the context dependence of mutational effects. Advances in high-throughput phenotyping now make it possible to study these relationships at unprecedented scale, generating large datasets that measure phenotypes for tens or hundreds of thousands of sequences. However, standard regression models for analyzing such datasets often make unrealistic assumptions about the generalizability of mutational effects and epistatic coefficients across genetic backgrounds. Deep neural networks offer greater flexibility but suffer from limited interpretability and lack uncertainty quantification. Here, we introduce a family of interpretable Gaussian process models for sequence-function relationships that capture epistasis through flexible prior distributions that generalize classical theoretical models from the fitness landscape literature. In particular, these priors are parameterized by interpretable site-, allele-, and mutation-specific factors controlling the degree to which specific mutations decrease the predictability of the effects of other mutations. Using GPU acceleration to scale to large protein, RNA, and genome-wide SNP datasets, our models consistently deliver superior predictive performance while yielding interpretable parameters that both recover known features and uncover novel epistatic interactions.

However, sex differences in the ChP have been little explored. Molecular profiling of the adult mouse ChP at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels revealed sex differences across multiple cell types, with immune signatures enriched in females. Interestingly, border associated macrophages showed distinct sex differences in the stromal and epiplexus compartments. We further uncovered sex differences in ChP secretory signalling, with functional differences between males and females. Finally, the human LVChP showed largely similar sex differences. Together, our findings highlight that sex differences may play an important role in ChP function in both health and disease.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Traditional segmentation methods, typically reliant on pixel-intensity thresholding, are highly sensitive to variations in imaging conditions and often fail in the presence of noise, overlaps, or uneven illumination. These failures necessitate meticulous experimental setups, expensive hardware, or extensive manual curation, which reduces throughput and introduces bias. Here, we introduce TWARDIS (Tools for Worm Automated Recognition & Dynamic Imaging System), a modular, Python-based analysis suite that leverages large foundation vision models, specifically the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) and a fine-tuned vision transformer classifier, to overcome these limitations. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our AI compound system across diverse modalities. For static morphological analysis, TWARDIS successfully resolved overlapping worms in noisy images without human intervention, showing a 0.999 correlation with manual segmentation. In behavioral assays (swimming and crawling), the pipeline enabled high-definition postural analysis even in low-resolution, wide-field recordings where the worm occupied only ~0.25% of the field of view, accurately resolving complex postures without frame rejection. Finally, when applied to calcium imaging of semi-restricted animals, TWARDIS provided precise, frame-by-frame segmentation of neural compartments, reducing the artificial signal flattening common in traditional region-of-interest-based approaches and enabling the extraction of biologically accurate, absolute head positions. The system's hardware-scalable architecture and modular design ensure both current accessibility and future improvements without restructuring. By automating the most time-consuming aspects of image analysis, TWARDIS removes critical bottlenecks and tradeoffs in C. elegans research, enabling researchers to focus on biological questions rather than technical image processing challenges.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

The specific neuronal populations that orchestrate this expectation-based tolerance remain poorly defined. In this study, we used a contextual tolerance training method alongside whole-brain clearing and immunostaining to identify brain regions involved in contextual tolerance and to pinpoint a specific neuronal ensemble in the ACC activated by this process. We observed that calcium activity in principal neurons of the ACC is suppressed by fentanyl in opioid-naive mice or during contextual reversal but not during contextual tolerance. Chemogenetic silencing of the ACC induced tolerance reversal in the opioid-associated context without affecting thermal nociception in opioid-free mice. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of the ACC contextual tolerance-active neuronal ensemble triggered analgesic tolerance in an unassociated context. This research highlights a role for ACC neuronal ensembles in mediating expectation-driven, contextual opioid analgesic tolerance without affecting basal nociception. Therefore, modulating the ACC could provide a promising strategy to improve pain relief while maintaining the essential ability to detect harmful stimuli.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

The nerve cord circuits in females that produce these behaviors are poorly characterized. We recently identified an anatomically diverse population of abdominal interneurons, the DDAG neurons, which express the Tlx-like nuclear receptor dissatisfaction (dsf) and influence several female mating behaviors. Here, we searched the dsf locus for cis-regulatory enhancer fragments that regulate its spatial expression in the adult and larval central nervous system. We found several enhancers, most located within two introns, that drove reporter expression in subsets of dsf-expressing neurons throughout the brain and nerve cord. Using one of these enhancers, we genetically isolated a single subtype of female-specific DDAG local interneurons. Optogenetic activation of these neurons triggered vaginal plate opening in both unmated and mated females, a behavior used by Drosophila females to signal receptivity to courting males. Our findings offer new reagents to target dsf-expressing cells and new insights into the neural substrates in Drosophila females that express their mating decisions during courtship.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Similarly, common human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, which typically cause mild cold-like symptoms, have also been linked to severe diseases, underscoring the need to understand virus-host interactions and identify host factors contributing to viral pathogenesis and disease progression. In this study, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen using HCoV-229E and identified Ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domain 1 (UHRF1) as a potent restriction factor. Mechanistically, UHRF1 suppressed HCoV-229E infection by downregulating the expression of its cell entry receptor, aminopeptidase N (APN), through promoter hypermethylation. Focused CRISPR activation screens of UHRF1-downregulated genes confirmed the critical role of APN in HCoV-229E infection and identified additional genes (e.g., SIGLEC1, PLAC8, and heparan sulfate biosynthesis genes) contributing to the restrictive functions of UHRF1. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that UHRF1 expression decreases with age, negatively correlating with increased APN expression. This age-related decline in UHRF1 was further validated in primary alveolar macrophages isolated from elderly individuals, which exhibited heightened susceptibility to HCoV-229E infection compared to those from younger individuals. Our findings highlight UHRF1 as a key age-related host defense factor against coronavirus infection and provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of viral entry receptors.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Since Bacteroides species often resides in mucus, OMVs are likely to represent a mechanism of communication between Bacteroides and the host. Two strains of Bacteroides were studied, Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), which produces BFT, and the non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis strain NCTC 9343 (NTBF) that does not express bft. We also utilized two additional strains of Bacteroides fragilis: one in which bft was knocked out (ETBF {Delta}bft), and one that was engineered to contain bft (NTBF+bft). We report that most Bacteroides fragilis OMVs reduced forskolin-stimulated CFTR Cl- secretion, but had no effect on tight junction or cell adhesion structure, transepithelial resistance or the innate immune response of primary human colon monolayers. BFT did have an adverse effect on CFTR Cl- secretion, but other factors in OMVs also inhibited CFTR Cl- secretion. We conclude that OMVs secreted by Bacteroides can be an important mechanism of host pathogen interactions in the colon by reducing CFTR Cl- secretion .", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we report an experimental pipeline for generating human mAbs from healthy donor B cells using synthetic mimics of complex bacterial glycans. We identified functional mAbs recognizing discrete and unique epitopes on the surface glycans of two bacterial priority pathogens; Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The use of chemically-defined synthetic glycans was critical for the discovery and systematic characterization of mAbs. From a heterogeneous mix of B cell specificities, mAbs were isolated with reactivities against immunodominant but also to less common or even masked epitopes.

H.; Doerflinger, M.; Herold, M. J.; Boddey, J.

There, they invade hepatocytes and develop into exoerythrocytic merozoites that, eventually, enter the bloodstream and invade erythrocytes, leading to malaria. The parasite journey involves cell traversal, where sporozoites transiently enter and exit host cells beginning in the skin, lysing membranes to move deeper into tissue and evade immune cell destruction. After reaching the liver and traversing several hepatocytes, sporozoites productively invade a final hepatocyte to establish liver-stage infection. The molecular mechanisms underlying traversal, invasion, and intracellular development remain incompletely understood, particularly with respect to host determinants. To address this, we engineered human HC-04 hepatocytes, the only known cell line supporting P. falciparum liver-stage development, to express Cas9-mCherry, enabling CRISPR-based functional genomics studies. We validated Cas9 activity and demonstrated successful guide-RNA-directed gene disruption via non-homologous end joining in HC-04 Cas9+ (clone 2B3) cells. Optimized traversal and invasion assays with HC-04 2B3 cells led to a robust cytometric assay suitable for screening human genes involved in P. falciparum infection. As proof-of-concept, we performed a small screen involving disruption of 10 human genes previously implicated in infection by bacterial and viral pathogens, confirming utility of this platform. While no new host factors were identified for malaria parasites in this initial study, we have developed a tractable system for genome-wide CRISPR screens to uncover novel hepatocyte biology and host determinants of infection by liver-tropic pathogens.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Here we repurpose the classic auxotrophic markers URA3 and TRP1 as tunable selection tools that quantitatively link gene-expression levels to growth outcomes. In uracil-deficient medium (SC-Ura), URA3 yields a positive, semi-quantitative growth response proportional to its expression level. Conversely, under selection with 5-fluoroanthranilic acid (5-FAA), TRP1 shows an inverse relationship between expression and survival: higher TRP1 expression triggers greater 5-FAA toxicity and reduced growth. Using integrative plasmids to vary gene copy number, we tuned expression levels and found that even ~2-4-fold differences produce distinct growth phenotypes. We also obtained dose-response results correlating marker expression with growth rates. Finally, applying this system to a synthetic mitochondrial mRNA localization scheme, we detected the resulting increase in protein expression via the growth-based readout. By converting traditional binary markers into tunable, quantitative selectors, this platform expands the yeast toolkit for evaluating gene expression differences and synthetic circuit function with simple growth assays.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

This study primarily aimed to further optimize our previously developed direct sequencing protocol for milk samples from mastitis cases. Additional optimizations included combining centrifugation, gradient centrifugation, and fat fraction treatment with Tween 20 and citric acid. Subsequently, four DNA extraction kits (Blood and Tissue, Molysis Complete5, HostZero, and SPINeasy Host depletion) were evaluated for their ability to remove host DNA and enrich bacterial DNA for long-read sequencing with Oxford Nanopore technologies. qPCR was used to quantify bacterial and bovine DNA, allowing comparison of host depletion efficiency among the kits. Our results show that simple centrifugation effectively concentrates bacterial cells, removing the need for chemical treatments. The HostZero kit consistently produced higher DNA yields, better DNA integrity, and more effective host DNA depletion. Using nanopore sequencing, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative mastitis pathogens, along with their AMR genes, were successfully detected.

We previously identified Na/K-ATPase (NKA) 1 as a signal transducer that activates Src family kinases and promotes oxidative stress and inflammation in various cell types, including adipocytes and macrophages. NaKtide, a peptide inhibitor of NKA signaling, has been shown to reduce systemic oxidative stress and inflammation in vivo. Here, we investigated the role of adipocyte-specific NKA signaling in atherosclerosis. METHODS: Adipocyte-specific NaKtide (Adipo-NaKtide) was delivered to Apoe-/- mice using a lentiviral vector under the adiponectin promoter. The mice were then fed a Western Diet (WD) for 12 weeks to induce atherosclerosis and then assessed for atherosclerotic plaque burden the aortic arch and at the level of the aortic sinus. Inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were analyzed in adipose tissue and plasma. RESULTS: Adipo-NaKtide reduced atherosclerotic plaque area by 67% in the aortic arch and 47% in the aortic sinus. CD68+ macrophage and -SMA+ smooth muscle cell content in the aortic sinus were decreased by 45% and 53%, respectively. These vascular improvements were accompanied by dampened adipose tissue inflammation and oxidative stress, improved glucose tolerance, and lowered systemic inflammation.

While cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation assays have recently been developed for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and perform well for cancer detection, they show limited sensitivity for advanced adenomas (AA), a key precursor in the CRC pathway. To address this gap, we sought to determine whether other blood-based analytes, specifically EV-derived long and small RNA transcriptomes and EV proteomes, could improve detection of AA and early-stage CRC. In a prospective cohort, we performed a head-to-head comparison of EV transcriptomics, EV proteomics, and their combinations against cfDNA methylation, all measured from the same patient cohort, enabling a direct performance benchmark and identification of the most promising modality for larger-scale CRC screening studies. METHODS: We prospectively collected pre-colonoscopy plasma samples from 220 participants across three clinical sites. EVs were isolated and profiled using long RNA-seq, small RNA-seq, and Olink-based proteomics. cfDNA was analyzed for methylation patterns. Analyses were conducted according to a statistical analysis plan pre-specified before unblinding. Machine learning models were developed under nested cross-validation to evaluate sensitivity for detecting AA and CRC at a fixed specificity of 91%, consistent with clinical screening benchmarks. RESULTS: EV-derived gene expression on long RNA demonstrated the highest sensitivity for detecting AA as well as CRC: 54.8% (95% CI, 26.4%-75.6%) for AA and 94.1% (95% CI, 79.2%-100%) for CRC. This outperformed cfDNA methylation (33.6% [95% CI, 9.7%-60.3%] for AA, 81.3% [95% CI, 64.6%-93.9%] for CRC) and other EV-based modalities. In addition, for small RNA the sensitivities were 42.6% (95% CI, 35.9%-47.4%) for AA, and 78.9% (95% CI, 69.2%-83.0%) for CRC, while for proteomics the sensitivities were 30.0% (95% CI, 13.9%-40.0%) for AA, and 64.2% (95% CI, 43.6%-87.2%) for CRC. Transcriptomic profiles revealed progressive enrichment of hallmarks of cancer pathways, including apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, across disease stages. Multiomic integration did not improve performance beyond EV transcriptomics alone. CONCLUSIONS: By directly comparing multiple EV-based and cfDNA analytes within the same patient cohort, we found that EV transcriptomics delivers the strongest diagnostic performance for both AA and CRC. This rigorous benchmarking approach allows clear prioritization of the most promising modality guiding the design of larger validation studies and accelerating development of next-generation, blood-based CRC screening tools.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Our ability to respond to emerging pandemics and pathogen resistance relies critically on our ability to build vaccines quickly and efficiently. In this report we used an efficient enzymatic oxidative coupling reaction to create a viral capsid-based vaccine platform that is modular and quickly adaptable for many different pathogens. Tyrosinase-mediated oxidative coupling was used to conjugate N-terminal tyrosine residues on peptide antigens to cysteine residues installed inside MS2 viral capsids. This strategy is particularly promising because the capsids protect the internally conjugated peptides from protease degradation before they are delivered into cells. The vaccine constructs were tested for MHC presentation followed by T-cell activation. Mutants of the MS2 capsid itself activated DC2.4 cells, serving as an adjuvant to help induce the immune response to delivered antigens. The MS2-peptide constructs were shown to be stable in serum, activate DC2.4 cells, and lead to MHC-presentation of peptide antigens with subsequent activation of antigen-specific T-cell hybridomas. Taken together, these results demonstrate effective activation of the adaptive immune system in vitro. This synthetic platform can be used to build new vaccines for many different diseases for which immunodominant peptide antigens are known because the antigens can be quickly interchanged while the MS2 scaffold remains the same. Additionally, this platform allows for multiple peptide antigens to be delivered simultaneously in each capsid, which could provide enhanced immunity against resistant strains and be useful for cancer vaccine development.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Notably, mutations that alter BRAF function are prominent drivers of human cancer and certain RASopathy disorders, making BRAF an important target for therapeutic intervention. Despite extensive research, several aspects of BRAF regulation remain unclear. In this study, we developed an in vitro BRAF activation assay using purified autoinhibited BRAF:14-3-32:MEK complexes. Our results show that fully processed, active-state KRAS alone can promote dimer-dependent BRAF activation. Moreover, we found that phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing liposomes synergized with KRAS to promote BRAF activation, achieving activity levels comparable to those observed with BRAF proteins that constitutively dimerize. In contrast, the SMP phosphatase complex had only a minimal effect on BRAF catalytic activity in this system but mediated the dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory pS365 14-3-3 binding site in a manner that was accelerated by the presence of KRAS alone or KRAS and 30% PS liposomes. Finally, we show that inhibitors blocking the BRAF RBD:KRAS interaction were able to suppress the in vitro activation of BRAF, underscoring the critical role of RAS binding in initiating the disassembly of the BRAF autoinhibited state. Thus, this assay provides valuable insights into the steps required for BRAF activation and can serve as an effective screening tool for identifying compounds that may inhibit this process and have therapeutic potential.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Leveraging this recognition mechanism, we developed a targeted protein degradation (TPD) strategy that recruits substrates directly to the proteasome, bypassing the ubiquitination step. Our proteasome-targeting chimera, Protea-Tac, is a heterobifunctional protein degrader composed of a Ub receptor (PSMD4/Rpn10 or ADRM1/Rpn13) and a target-specific, intracellular antibody (single-chain variable fragment or nanobody). This chimera integrates into 26S proteasomes without altering their structural or functional integrity. Localization of target proteins, including c-Fos, BRD4, Flag-TDP43, HA-tau, and GFP-ODC, to the proteasome via Protea-Tac with cognate antibodies resulted in their induced degradation. We demonstrated that this platform is 1) modular, requiring both essential components but allowing for facile switching between targets; 2) Ub-independent through direct proteasomal targeting; and 3) highly target-specific. Protea-Tac degraded c-Fos in vivo and substantially delayed tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Overall, these findings identify Protea-Tac as a distinct TPD modality capable of direct proteasomal degradation of intracellular proteins.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

This approach overlooks a key class of signals: the composition of cells within a sample or defined population. Such signals are often critical for inferring tissue identity, disease state, or other sample-level phenotypes. To address this limitation, we introduce TissueFormer, a Transformer-based neural network that analyzes groups of single-cell RNA profiles to infer population-level labels while retaining single-cell resolution. Applied to predict the cortical area of groups of cells sampled from spatial transcriptomic data from mouse brains, TissueFormer outperformed both single-cell foundation models and machine learning methods applied to pseudobulk and cell type composition. This higher performance enables the automated construction of high-resolution brain region maps in individual animals directly from spatial transcriptomic data.

Yet, interactions of SopB with host proteins have remained ill-defined. Here, we employ the unique Virotrap mass spectrometry-based technology to identify a new set of SopB-associated host proteins. We demonstrate the direct interaction of SopB with the ubiquitin-binding domains of the ESCRT-0 subunit HGS, and we show that SopB promotes ESCRT-0 recruitment at the SCV where they colocalize.

This study investigates the inhibitory effects of selected probiotics (Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum) and their synbiotic combinations with inulin on ETEC proliferation, adhesion, intestinal colonization, and host immune response. Methods: ETEC H10407 was cultured in Luria-Bertani broth and co-cultured with probiotic strains to assess growth dynamics. Adhesion and competitive inhibition assays were performed using INT 407 intestinal epithelial cells. A murine infection model (C57BL/6) was employed to evaluate pathogen colonization, diarrheal severity, stool consistency, histopathological changes, and immune modulation. Synbiotic efficacy was further tested by combining probiotics with the prebiotic inulin. Additionally, fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) was conducted to examine microbiome-mediated protective effects. Results: Probiotic co-culture significantly inhibited ETEC growth from 2 h onward without impairing probiotic viability. All probiotics markedly reduced ETEC adhesion to INT 407 small intestinal cells. In vivo, probiotics lowered ETEC colonization by 81.34%, while synbiotics conferred an additional 29.68% reduction. Synbiotics prevent watery stool and preserve ileal architecture, with reduced goblet cell loss and neutrophil infiltration. Synbiotics significantly (p<0.0001) decreased CD3+/CD4+ Th1 cells in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and restored tight junctional proteins. Conclusion: Synbiotic supplementation offered superior protection against ETEC-induced diarrhea compared to probiotics or prebiotics alone, highlighting its potential as a non-antibiotic prophylactic strategy. These findings support the role of microbiome-targeted interventions within the One Health framework to address enteric infections and antimicrobial resistance.

W.; Harrington, A. A.; Nickels, T. J.", "abstract": "Upon exposure to echinocandins, growing yeast cells begin to accumulate cell wall damage and eventually die, resulting in therapeutic effects. While resistance to echinocandins is well studied, tolerance and persistence mechanisms that may also contribute to clinical failures and relapses remain understudied. In time-kill assays with micafungin in vitro, the opportunistic pathogen Candida glabrata exhibited biphasic kinetics of cell death. Modeling with exponential decay equations distinguished a fast-dying major population from a slow-dying minor population, indicative of persistence. A genome-wide forward-genetic screen revealed dozens of genes that appeared to regulate persistence and/or tolerance, but not resistance. Several of those genes encoded calcineurin and its upstream regulators. Using individual gene knockout mutants and FK506, we show that calcineurin signaling increases the lifespans of most C. glabrata cells through a process that is largely independent of Crz1, one of its downstream effectors. The formation of long-lived persister-like cells (i.e. persistence) was strongly dependent on calcineurin signaling, independent of Crz1. Pre-activation of calcineurin using genetic or chemical stressors, such as manogepix, strongly increased tolerance and persistence in C. glabrata, suggesting antagonism of echinocandin efficacy by this new antifungal. Calcineurin signaling was also necessary for induction of tolerance and persistence in Candida albicans. The findings suggest that short-term administration of FK506 during the earliest stages of echinocandin treatment may improve clinical outcomes while possibly avoiding long-term immunosuppression.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

However, this method has long been reported to amplify byproduct DNA derived from reverse-transcription primers, particularly under conditions of low RNA abundance, leading to experimental complexity and reduced accuracy in quantifying gene expression. In this study, we elucidated the mechanism by which byproduct DNA is amplified at the molecular level and developed a new strategy of suppressing it named Suppression Tagging (SupTag). SupTag makes use of TdT, which has extremely low extension efficiency at the 3' recessive end, to stabilize dA/dT base pairs and inhibit poly-A extension of oligo-dT primers, thereby preventing the formation of precursor DNA for byproduct DNA. We demonstrated that SupTag can specifically suppress byproduct DNA using chemicals such as tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC), modified nucleotides (e.g., 2F-dATP), and Super T-modified reverse-transcription primers. SupTag improves usability by streamlining purification processes and prevents reductions in sequence read output and quantitative sensitivity caused by byproduct DNA. Additionally, SupTag demonstrated the ability to suppress byproduct DNA amplification without using suppression PCR and is compatible with cDNA amplification introducing different adapter sequences at both ends. This study presents a novel suppression method based on the mechanism of amplification of byproduct DNA in the poly-A tagging method, providing a practical technology enabling high-precision transcriptomic analysis from low-abundance RNA.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Here, endogenous live cell imaging has revealed the altered chromosomal dynamics/condensate formation occurring during estrogen receptor a (ERa)-dependent target gene bursting/post-bursting and chronic activation events. Simultaneous DNA/RNA endogenous live imaging reveals that an increased mobility of acutely ERa-stimulated loci observed during the bursting phase is, unexpectedly, further increased in the subsequent non-burst phase. Single molecule tracking (SMT) of ERa shows that the relatively high-burst, lower-mobility acute state was indeed enriched for high-viscosity, 1,6-hexanediol-sensative ERa molecules in a low sub-diffusive confined state with enhanced condensate formation during burst activation. Consistent with this, blocking transcription with flavopiridol shifts DNA tracks into a non-confined state.

Recent studies have reported extra-lysosomal localisation of these proteases, especially in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and extracellularly, yet their function is not completely understood. To examine the relationship between legumain and cathepsins, we assessed the activity and expression of cathepsins in wild-type and legumain-deficient (LGMN-/-) cells using chemical activity-based probes and immunoblots. Processing of cathepsins (CTS) L, V, B, and D from the single-chain to the two-chain form was abrogated in the absence of legumain, with some cell type- and species-specific variation observed. This processing was dependent on legumain activity, although the mechanism remains unclear since recombinant legumain does not appear to directly cleave cathepsins in vitro. In cell types where CTSL exists in the nucleus preferentially in its double chain form, loss of legumain led to a reduction in nuclear CTSL levels. To understand the potential role of these lysosomal proteases in the nucleus, we applied our newly refined chemical N-terminomics pipeline, No-enrichment Identification of Cleavage Events (NICE). This analysis revealed widespread changes in both protein abundance and proteolysis, including putative nuclear substrates of CTSL and legumain, that primarily suggest roles in cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, inflammation, and ribosomal biogenesis.

We identified dynamic changes in physiological aging highlighting differences in synaptic maintenance and energy-allocation. These were linked to changes associated with fundamental protein biochemical properties such as size and net charge. Network analysis highlighted a decrease in mitochondrial complex I proteins not compensated at the mRNA level.

Previous studies have demonstrated that delivery of the NPC1 gene to the central nervous system (CNS) via an adeno-associated virus (AAV) can substantially improve lifespan and mitigate signs of disease in Npc1-deficient mouse models of NPC. To determine the optimal parameters for an efficacious AAV-based gene therapy for NPC, we measured the survival and disease phenotypes of mice treated systemically as neonates or at weaning age, along with neonatal mice treated via intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery, with a construct containing either a ubiquitous truncated EF1 promoter or a truncated Mecp2 promoter. While all constructs and delivery methods resulted in improvement compared with baseline, mice treated as neonates survived significantly longer and experienced slower disease progression compared with those treated systemically at weaning age. Systemic delivery to neonates was capable of increasing survival and phenotypic improvement comparable to that of ICV delivery, and neonatal systemic and ICV delivery were both similarly capable of near-total Purkinje cell rescue. We also found no difference between a ubiquitous EF1-derived promoter and an Mecp2-derived promoter. Ultimately, early treatment with maximal access to the CNS, whether via systemic or direct CNS delivery, is key to the efficacy of gene therapy in treating NPC.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Current therapeutics face several drawbacks while treating bacterial infections because of the bacteria's ability to attach to various surfaces and form biofilm as a defence mechanism. One such pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can form biofilm for its survival in the presence of various antibacterial agents. The present study explores the efficacy of green synthesized silver nanoparticles against bacteria, mainly against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where Lantana camara leaf extract contributes as a reducing agent to reduce Ag+ to Ag0. UV-vis spectroscopy of the nanoparticle showed a maximum spectrum at 416 nm, while dynamic light scattering revealed the size to be 30-35nm. The size and morphology of the nanoparticle were confirmed by various electron microscopies. The synthesized nanoparticles revealed significant antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa environmental isolates KPW.1-S1 and HRW.1-S3. Further, microscopic analyses through confocal and scanning electron microscopy validated the reduction in biofilm. Importantly, the cytotoxic effect of the nanoparticle on Human Kidney Epithelial-like cells was checked, and it revealed no significant toxicity. Therefore, Lantana camara silver conjugated nanoparticles provide an eco-friendly alternative to traditional antimicrobials, highlighting their potential for combating multidrug-resistant infection while ensuring mammalian cell safety.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Yet, while useful, most ChIP-seq protocols include multiple manual steps that can introduce inconsistency and make it burdensome to analyze large sample sets, limiting the inclusion of appropriate replicates and other controls. Although some of these challenges were addressed by incorporation of liquid handling platforms, most of those previous efforts have automated only a subset of the ChIP-seq steps. Further, using automation for efficiently mapping non-histone proteins, such as chromatin regulators, has been challenging. We recently developed a single-pot ChIP-seq protocol1. Here we established a liquid handler operation for this protocol and created an end-to-end fully automated version that is scalable from 8 to 96 ChIP-seq reactions. Our single-pot automated (spa-ChIP-seq) protocol requires about 3 days from cross-linked cells to library, and the costs to produce indexed libraries is approximately $70 per sample. We first benchmarked spa-ChIP-seq against manual ChIP-seq that was performed in parallel, showing a nearly indistinguishable signal-to-noise ratio between the two workflows. Next, we used spa-ChIP-seq to systematically evaluate multiple parameters including shearing and crosslinking conditions, buffer compositions, and antibody to cell-number ratios. Our method allowed us to identify optimal conditions for double crosslinked chromatin as well as easily and robustly conduct titrations and screening of different antibodies and reagents, eliminating many laborious and costly steps. We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the effect of the ratio of antibody to cell-number is most pronounced in detecting weak genomic localization signals. In particular, while strong signal seems to be unimpacted by low antibody to cell-number ratio, weaker signals are sensitive to this ratio. We note the importance of maintaining a consistent antibody to cell-number ratio, especially when conducting comparative studies, e.g., between treatments such as small molecules, or individuals such as for chromatin-QTL mapping. Our automated ChIP-seq protocol is publicly available, including specific deck setups, software files and parameters. Lastly, we envision that our robust, cost-efficient protocol can advance research via multiple fronts, e.g., by (i) allowing the scaling up the number of replicates and conditions tested, (ii) improving quantification precision when using spike-in normalization in ChIP-seq experiments2, (iii) enabling core facilities to provide high-throughput ChIP-seq as a service and (iv) being incorporated into antibody evaluation procedures, compound screening, population genomics and diagnostic frameworks.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

While Pirfenidone (PFD) and Liraglutide (LIR) have shown promise individually in treating fibrosis, their combined effect on autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways remains unexplored. Methods and Results: To investigate the protective effects of combined LIR and PFD therapy on autophagy and NLRP3 inflammasome, fifty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: Sham, BDL, BDL+PFD (200 mg/kg), BDL+LIR (600 microg/kg), and BDL+PFD+LIR combination. Following 20 days of treatment, liver tissues were analyzed for histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) changes, biochemical parameters, and molecular markers of fibrosis, autophagy, and inflammasome activation. The combination therapy significantly reduced liver damage markers (ALT, AST, ALP), decreased ECM deposition, and improved histological parameters compared to monotherapy. Combined treatment effectively suppressed inflammatory markers (NF-kB, TNF-alpha) while increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10. Furthermore, the combination therapy modulated autophagy markers (Beclin 1), cathepsib B and reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation (NLRP3, Caspase 1, IL-1{beta}, IL-18) more effectively than either drug alone. IHC staining of Ki-67 and HepPar-1 showed that combination therapy increased liver regeneration.

To address this gap, we developed the Effective Career and Immigration Planning for International Scholars (ECIP) program, a seven-session workshop series designed to align participants' career development with their U.S. immigration goals. Grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory, the ECIP program introduces the concept of the immigration portfolio: a strategic collection of evidence documenting accomplishments and credentials valuable for both academic success metrics and an advanced degree holder's permanent residence petition. Here, we present the pilot implementation of this program and report its evaluation, which included pre- and post-program surveys, weekly polls of call-to-action task, and follow-up communications with participants. Our results demonstrate significant increases in participants' self-reported knowledge and confidence to take action towards their career and immigration goals. Post-program survey responses showed higher agreement levels on understanding immigration portfolio preparation and permanent residence options, demonstrating the program's effectiveness in addressing knowledge gaps. Engagement data revealed that participants consistently completed the proposed action items from workshops, aligning with the session's learning objectives.

We leveraged a theoretical advancement, latent state-trait theory-revised, to disaggregate the components of students' self-efficacy into stable or trait-like self-efficacy and dynamic or state-like self-efficacy. We determined that students' scientific self-efficacy was moderately stable during their research, with the most malleable component being beliefs in their abilities to figure out data collection and explain results. We also surveyed students ~45 times throughout their research experience to test the extent to which research hours and types of research tasks contributed to self-efficacy development.

It is less clear how off-RF stimuli modulate neural responses and contribute to behavioral tasks. Our recent study revealed a particular form of location-specific facilitation evoked by repeated stimulation from an off-RF location, suggesting behavioral modulation of spatial RFs. To further explore this question, we trained marmosets to attend to sound locations that were either inside or outside the RFs of auditory cortical neurons. The majority of neurons showed increased firing rates at target locations inside their RFs. Interestingly, this increase also occurred outside the RFs, sometimes exceeding the responses at the RF center during passive listening. These task-related off-RF facilitation were much more common in the caudal area than in the rostral area and the primary auditory cortex. A normalization model reproduced the off-RF facilitation using widespread suppression. The model's prediction was confirmed by experimental observations of widespread reductions in firing rate and hyperpolarized membrane potentials for off-RF stimuli. These results suggest that behavioral task demands recruit a broader range of neurons than those that are responsive to a target sound in the passive state.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Yet, most neurophysiological research on face processing relies on two-dimensional displays, potentially overlooking the role of stereoscopic depth information. Here, we combine immersive virtual reality (VR), electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking to examine the neural representation of faces under controlled manipulations of stereoscopic depth. Thirty-four participants viewed computer-generated faces with neutral, happy, angry, and surprised expressions in frontal view under monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing conditions. Using time-resolved multivariate decoding, we show that EEG signals in immersive VR conditions can reliably differentiate facial expressions. Stereoscopic depth cues elicited a distinct and decodable neural signature, confirming the sensitivity of our approach to depth-related processing. Yet, expression decoding remained robust across depth conditions, indicating that under controlled frontal viewing, the neural encoding of facial expressions is invariant to binocular depth cues. Eye tracking showed that expression-related gaze patterns contained comparable information but did not account for neural representations, while depth information was absent in gaze patterns---consistent with dissociable representational processes.

A.", "abstract": "The brain is a metabolically vulnerable organ as neurons have both high resting metabolic rates and the need for local rapid conversion of carbon sources to ATP during activity. Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to be particularly vulnerable to metabolic perturbations, as a subset of these are the first to undergo degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder long suspected to be in part driven by deficits in mid-brain bioenergetics (1). In skeletal muscle, energy homeostasis under varying demands is achieved in part by its ability to rely on glycogen as a fuel store, whose conversion to ATP is under hormonal regulatory control. In neurons however the absence of easily observable glycogen granules has cast doubt on whether this fuel store is operational, even though brain neurons express the key regulatory enzymes associated with building or burning glycogen (2). We show here that that in primary mid brain dopaminergic neurons, glycogen availability is under the control of dopamine auto receptors (D2R), such that dopamine itself provides a signal to store glycogen. We find that when glycogen stores are present, they provide remarkable resilience to dopamine nerve terminal function under extreme hypometabolic conditions, but loss of this dopamine derived signal, or impairment of access to glycogen, makes them hypersensitive to fuel deprivation. These data show that neurons can use an extracellular cue to regulate local metabolism and suggest that loss of dopamine secretion might make dopamine neurons particularly subject to neurodegeneration driven by metabolic stress.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

Using immunofluorescence, we studied DCX coexpression with the cell proliferation marker Ki-67, and different neuronal markers. Our results show the existence of numerous DCX+ cells throughout the olfactory pallial areas. In some of them, we found DCX+/Ki-67+ coexpressing cells, suggesting that they were proliferating. Some of these proliferating cells were grouped in tangentially-oriented migratory-like chains, forming the rostral migratory stream to anterior olfactory area and olfactory bulb. Moreover, chains of DCX+ cells were found in the external capsule and white matter adjacent to the temporal horn of the ventricle. Chains of DCX+ cells were observed crossing the internal layers of the piriform and entorhinal cortices. In layer II of these cortices, DCX+ cells of varying maturity degrees and neuronal phenotypes (including NeuN expression) were present.

Participants were tested using morphed faces that blended the original stimuli in varying proportions. Immediate generalization was assessed post-learning, and delayed generalization was assessed after overnight sleep or daytime wakefulness. Behaviorally, we found that sleep selectively promotes positive generalization, whereas prolonged daytime wakefulness favors generalization of the negative face. In the fMRI scanner, amygdala and limbic activity during outcome processing predicted stronger immediate generalization of the negative face, and subsequent shift from negative to positive face generalization that occurred only after sleep. Overnight sleep spindle activity, extracted from high-density sleep EEG, positively correlated both with positive face generalization and with the shift from negative to positive generalization following sleep.

Effort and reward sensitivity in such situations vary substantially across individuals and ultimately shape goal-directed behavior. Yet, the brain mechanisms underlying this variability across individuals remain unclear. Here, we combined computational modeling of effort and reward sensitivity during decision-making with whole-brain diffusion MRI in 45 healthy participants to identify white matter substrates of individual sensitivity. A data-driven, cluster-based analysis of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity revealed 12 clusters: five linked to effort sensitivity, all within tracts connected to major frontal valuation nodes (e.g., supplementary motor area [SMA], dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC], orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]), and seven linked to reward sensitivity, spanning frontal valuation, fronto-parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The strongest associations involved two SMA-connected clusters, one shared across effort and reward sensitivity and another consistent across both microstructural metrics. Critically, microstructural features from the five effort-related and seven reward-related clusters reliably predicted individual effort and reward sensitivity in out-of-sample machine learning analyses, respectively, whereas randomly sampled clusters did not. SMA-connected tracts were the dominant predictors in these decoding analyses, with additional contributions from fronto-parietal and sensorimotor pathways for reward sensitivity. These findings reveal a distributed white matter architecture underlying inter-individual differences in effort and reward sensitivity, with SMA pathways emerging as central hubs. They demonstrate that localized white matter microstructure can robustly predict these individual differences, offering a framework to forecast the impact of lesions or interventions on goal-directed behavior, including apathy and impulsivity.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

This process, called mutagenic retrohoming, uses a reverse transcriptase to specifically introduce mutations at adenine residues. The enzyme misincorporates bases opposite template adenines, and the resulting mutagenized complementary cDNA then somehow integrates into the homologous target gene, thereby introducing the mutations. While the core DGR components are well-understood, the mechanisms regulating their activity within a cellular context remain largely unknown. To address this, we successfully reconstituted the DGR from the Bordetella phage BPP-1 in Escherichia coli. Using high-throughput methods in this non-native host, we identified several factors that influence DGR activity. Our systematic analysis revealed that the reverse transcriptase is especially mutagenic in the 5'-AAC-3' and 5'-ACC-3' contexts, a finding that explains why these motifs are so abundant in natural DGR RNA templates. Furthermore, a transposon sequencing screen uncovered positive and negative regulators of DGR function. We found that the single-stranded DNA exonuclease ExoI inhibits DGR activity, surprisingly, through a nuclease-independent mechanism. By profiling thousands of chromosomal reporters in parallel, we also discovered that DGR preferentially edit targets located near the replication origin and oriented co-directional with replication. We provide evidence that this bias is linked to directionality of replication and propose that replication-induced unwinding of the target facilitates base pairing of the incoming cDNA. These comprehensive findings not only advance our understanding of how DGR operates within cells but also enabled us to improve the efficiency of DGR-mediated editing by 1000-fold.

Leveraging this dataset, we established threshold values for 15 key physicochemical descriptors, including partition coefficient (alogP) and hydrogen bond donor/acceptor counts for each therapeutic group, providing practical benchmarks for indication-specific compound prioritization and filtering. We also analyzed cross-indication approvals to identify therapeutic areas with high repurposing potential. Furthermore, we introduce a pathway-based computational pipeline to predict repositioning opportunities for FDA approved drugs across 10 major cancer types, which can be readily extended to other therapeutic domains. Collectively, our work integrates curated drug target data, therapeutic specific physicochemical profiling, and computational repurposing into a scalable, data driven framework for accelerating drug discovery applications.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Intron retention (IR) is an understudied mode of alternative splicing with emerging roles in development and stress responses. Here, we present a comprehensive in vivo analysis of IR dynamics during zebrafish larval development and under environmental perturbation. Using deep poly(A)-selected RNA sequencing across three post-fertilization stages (4, 10, and 15 days), we identify IR as a dominant and developmentally regulated splicing event, affecting over 1,000 genes. Unexpectedly, differential IR occurs largely independently of transcript abundance, suggesting a distinct regulatory axis that modulates RNA output via isoform structure rather than expression level. Genes exhibiting IR are enriched in pathways critical to RNA metabolism, neurodevelopment, cell stress responses and genome maintenance--functions that are not captured by differential expression analysis alone. We further show that exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) reshapes the IR landscape, eliciting both shared and diet-specific splicing responses. Strikingly, some introns display opposing retention dynamics under HFD compared to normal development, highlighting the context-dependent responsiveness of IR regulation. Together, our findings position IR as a selective and environmentally responsive mechanism that contributes to shaping the transcriptome during vertebrate development.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}

A.; Trynka, G.; Bassett, A.", "abstract": "Mounting evidence implicates microglia in neurodegeneration, but linking disease-associated genetic variants to target genes and cellular phenotypes is hindered by the inaccessibility of these cells. We differentiated 261 human iPSC lines into microglia-like cells (iMGL) in pools with phenotypic (differentiation, phagocytosis and migration) and single-cell transcriptomic readouts. Burden analysis of deleterious variants detected 36 genes influencing microglial phenotypes. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis found 7,121 eGenes, and 79 colocalizations across four neurodegenerative disease GWAS, half of which had limited prior evidence of causality. Integration of eQTL and phenotypic associations highlighted the role of disease-relevant variants including LRRK2 and TREM2 acting via microglial phagocytosis. A coupled CRISPR screen identified a role of TREM2 in phagocytosis and highlighted the importance of cellular state in directionality of phenotype. By contextualizing variant effects within disease-relevant microglial states, we provide a comprehensive framework for interpreting the function of risk loci in neurodegenerative disorders.", "date": "2025-08-19", "journal": ""}
