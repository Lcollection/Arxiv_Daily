To systematically define the transcription factors (TFs) driving these states, we built a comprehensive atlas integrating transcriptional and epigenetic data across nine CD8+ T cell states and inferred TF activity profiles. Our analysis catalogued TF activity fingerprints of each state, uncovering new regulatory mechanisms that govern differentiation of selective cell states. Leveraging this platform, we focused on two transcriptionally similar but functionally opposing states critical in tumor and viral contexts: terminally exhausted T cells (TEXterm), which are dysfunctional, and tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), which are protective. Global TF community analysis revealed distinct state-specific biological pathways and TF-driven networks that govern protective versus dysfunctional T cell states. Through in vivo CRISPR screening integrated with single-cell RNA sequencing (in vivo Perturb-seq), we delineated TF-driven networks that govern protective versus dysfunctional T cell states. We identified HIC1 and GFI1 as shared regulators of TEXterm and TRM differentiation and KLF6 as a unique regulator of TRM. Importantly, we discovered novel TEXterm single-state TFs, including ZSCAN20 and JDP2 with no prior known function in T cells. Targeted deletion of these TFs enhanced tumor control and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade. Consistently, their depletion in human T cells reduces the expression of inhibitory receptors and improves effector function. By decoupling exhaustion-selective from protective TRM programs, our platform enables more precise engineering of T cell states, advancing rational design of effective immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Pathogens can alter the phenotype not only of exposed hosts, but also of future generations. Transgenerational immune priming, where parental infection drives reduced susceptibility of offspring, has been particularly well explored, but pathogens can also alter life history traits of offspring. Here, we examined the potential for transgenerational impacts of a microsporidian pathogen, Ordospora pajunii, by experimentally measuring the impact of maternal exposure on offspring fitness in the presence and absence of parasites, and then developing mathematical models that explored the population-level impacts of these transgenerational effects. We did not find evidence of transgenerational immune priming: offspring of exposed mothers became infected at high rates, similar to offspring of unexposed mothers, and the infection burden did not differ between these two groups. We also did not find any evidence of transgenerational tolerance, where daughters of exposed mothers have higher fitness after infection. Instead, we found evidence for negative transgenerational impacts of infection: uninfected offspring of exposed mothers had substantially greater early life mortality than uninfected offspring of unexposed mothers. Offspring of exposed mothers also had reduced growth rate, fewer clutches, and fewer offspring. We propose that these observations should be considered transgenerational virulence, where a pathogen reduces the fitness of the offspring of infected hosts. Our parameterized mathematical model allowed us to explore the impacts of transgenerational virulence at the population level. If transgenerational virulence manifests as decreased reproduction or increased mortality in offspring, as we saw in the empirical portion of our study, this reduces total host density, infection prevalence, and infected host density, which could have implications for both host conservation and spillover risk. We propose that transgenerational virulence might be common and is a concept worthy of further empirical and theoretical exploration.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Lanthanide-associated metabolisms are well-studied in leaf symbiont methylotrophic bacteria, which utilize reduced one-carbon compounds such as methanol for growth. Yet, the importance of lanthanides in plant-microbe interactions and on microbial physiology and colonization in plants remains poorly understood. To investigate this, 344 pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophs were isolated from soybean leaves by selecting for bacteria capable of methanol oxidation with lanthanide cofactors, but none were obligately lanthanide-dependent. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all strains were nearly identical to each other and are part of the extorquens clade of Methylobacterium, despite variability in genome and plasmid sizes. Strain-specific identification was enabled by the higher resolution provided with rpoB compared to 16S rRNA as marker genes. Despite the low strain-level diversity, the metabolic capabilities of the collection diverged greatly. Strains encoding identical lanthanide-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases displayed significantly different growth rates and/or final ODs from each other on alcohols in the presence and absence of lanthanides. Several strains also lacked well-characterized lanthanide-associated genes thought to be important for phyllosphere colonization. Additionally, 3% of our isolates were capable of growth on sugars and 23% were capable of growth on aromatic acids, substantially expanding the range of substrates utilized by Methylobacterium extorquens in the phyllosphere. Our findings suggest that the expansion of metabolic capabilities, as well as differential usage of lanthanides and their influence on metabolism, among closely related strains point to evolution of niche partitioning strategies to promote colonization of the phyllosphere.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence suggests that nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) components play a critical role in neurodegeneration. This study investigates the effects of modulating the levels of different karyopherins on mutant Ataxin-1 (mATXN1)-induced neurodegeneration in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1) Drosophila and cell models. Our findings reveal that ATXN1 [82Q] interacts with KPNAs in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons. Increasing KPNA levels ameliorates ATXN1 [82Q]-induced neurodegeneration and progressive neuronal dysfunction. Surprisingly, elevated KPNA levels did not increase nuclear mATXN1, instead, mechanistic analyses demonstrate that KPNA retains mATXN1 in the cytoplasm, reducing its nuclear accumulation. Moreover, higher KPNA leads to a decrease in soluble oligomeric mATXN1. Interestingly, inhibition of a different karyopherin, KPNB1, elevated KPNA levels and reduced nuclear mATXN1 in human neuronal precursor cells. Consistently, knockdown of KPNB1 attenuates ATXN1 [82Q]-induced neurodegeneration and reduces its nuclear aggregation in Drosophila. These results indicate that KPNAs may act as chaperones for mATXN1, preventing its nuclear translocation and reducing its pathological effects. Importantly, they also constitute a proof of principle that retaining mATXN1 in the cytoplasm represents an attractive and viable therapeutic option. Given the dysregulation of karyopherins in many neurodegenerative diseases and their emerging role as chaperones, the results presented here may extend beyond SCA1 into other disorders like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we analyzed viral dynamics across 20 compost-derived microbial communities propagated for one year in mesocosms. Communities clustered into two distinct types, each dominated by different cellulose-degraders and comprising hundreds of genera. In one type, we observed massive, parallel outbreaks of Theomophage, a previously undescribed bacteriophage, reaching 74% of metagenomic sequencing reads, the largest bacteriophage outbreak documented to date. Theomophage populations in isolated communities were composed of a single genotype that showed striking evolutionary stability throughout the experiment. In contrast, following experimental viral migration between mesocosms, all Theomophage populations showed rapid evolution via recombination between preexisting genotypes, replacement of ancestral lineages, and, upon successful migration to mesocosms of the alternate community type where Theomophage was initially absent, rapid acquisition of novel mutations that swept local populations and then spread to other mesocosms. Our study reveals the spatial and temporal scales at which bacteriophage microdiversity evolves in complex communities. It further shows that mixing of viral communities -- likely common in natural systems -- can rapidly accelerate bacteriophage evolution.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Efficient DNA double strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) with the sister chromatid also depends on cohesin. Here, we have examined the role of residual cohesin in DSB repair in telophase (late mitosis). We have found that Scc1 returns in telophase after DSBs, and that it partially reconstitutes a chromatin-bound cohesin complex with Smc1 and an acetylated pool of Smc3 after a single HO-induced DSB at the MAT locus. However, this new cohesin is neither required for the HR-driven MAT switching nor binds to the MAT locus after the DSB.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Predictive cues of a target location orient covert attention and improve perceptual performance. In most computational models, researchers explicitly incorporate an attentional mechanism that alters processing at the attended location (gain, noise reduction, divisive normalization, biased competition, Bayesian priors). Here, we assess the emergent neuronal mechanisms of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that exhibit behavioral signatures of covert attention, despite lacking a built-in attention mechanism. We use neuroscience-inspired approaches to analyze 1.8M units of CNNs trained on the cueing paradigm. Consistent with neurophysiology, we show early layers with retinotopic neurons separately tuned to the target or cue, and later layers with neurons with joint tuning and increased cue influence on target responses. CNN computational stages mirror a Bayesian ideal observer (BIO), but with more gradual transitions. The cue influences the target sensitivity through four mechanisms. A BIO-like cue-weighted location summation, and three mechanisms absent in the BIO: an opponency across locations, a summation/opponency location combination, and interaction with the thresholding Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Re-analyses of mice's superior colliculus neuronal activity during a cueing task show CNN-predicted but previously unreported cue-inhibitory, location-summation, and location-opponent cells in addition to the commonly reported cue (attention) excitatory cells.

The conventional exploration/exploitation tradeoff is thus coloured by risk-sensitivity. A wealth of experiments has shown how animals solve this dilemma, for example using intermittent approach. However, there are large individual differences in the nature of approach, and modeling has yet to elucidate how this might be based on animals' differing prior expectations about reward and threat, and differing degrees of risk aversion. To capture these factors, we built a Bayes adaptive Markov decision process model with three key components: an adaptive hazard function capturing potential predation, an intrinsic reward function providing the urge to explore, and a conditional value at risk (CVaR) objective, which is a contemporary measure of trait risk-sensitivity. We fit this model to a coarse-grain abstraction of the behaviour of 26 animals who freely explored a novel object in an open-field arena (Akiti et al. Neuron 110, 2022). We show that the model captures both quantitative (frequency, duration of exploratory bouts) and qualitative (with distinguished, cautious, tail-behind approach) features of behavior, including the substantial idiosyncrasies that were observed. Some animals begin with cautious exploration, and quickly transition to confident approach to maximize exploration for reward; we classify them as potentially more risk neutral, and enjoying a flexible hazard prior. By contrast, other animals only ever approach in a cautious manner and display a form of self-censoring; they are characterized by potential risk aversion and high and inflexible hazard priors.

Here we studied rats performing a decision-making task with reward- and movement-related events at distinct time points. Optical measurement of dopamine and acetylcholine release in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) revealed distinct dynamics at task events. Reward cues evoked cholinergic pauses with different phase relationships relative to dopamine. When dopamine slightly lagged cholinergic dips, dopamine predicted future behaviour, and DMS firing rates on subsequent trials. In contrast, when dopamine slightly preceded cholinergic dips, there was no observable relationship between dopamine and learning. Finally, when dopamine was coincident with cholinergic bursts, it preceded and predicted the vigour of upcoming contralateral orienting movements. Our findings suggest that the precise phase relationship between dopamine and acetylcholine allows dopamine to be used for either movement or learning depending on instantaneous behavioural context.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

While secondary axon degeneration has been proposed as a primary driver of pathogenesis, our prior work demonstrated neuromuscular deficits in CMT1A mice in the absence of overt axonal loss, prompting investigation into primary myelin dysfunction. Here, we reveal that altered PMP22 dosage profoundly disrupts molecular architecture at critical myelin subdomains, Schmidt-Lanterman incisures (SLIs) and Nodes of Ranvier. Using high-resolution confocal imaging of teased peripheral nerve fibers from CMT1A and HNPP model mice, we identified disorganization of adherens junctions, mislocalization of Connexin29, and altered distribution of nodal ion channels in CMT1A and HNPP, with several defects more pronounced in CMT1A, aligning with clinical severity. Notably, Kv1.2 and Caspr mislocalization along the internode and Nav nodal widening suggest disruption of axoglial domains essential for saltatory conduction. Together, these phenotypes support a model in which PMP22 governs myelin architecture, likely through adherens junction regulation, with its dysregulation predicted to impair metabolic support and axonal ion homeostasis, thereby compromising the structural and functional integrity of myelin and contributing directly to disease pathogenesis. These findings shift the pathogenic paradigm for CMT1A and HNPP from axonal degeneration to primary myelin failure and highlight actionable molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.

In this study, we performed a loss-of-function genetic screen targeting genes potentially involved in microtubular motility. A genetic background that blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusions was used to accurately analyze autophagosome positioning. We discovered that pre-fusion autophagosomes move towards the non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center (ncMTOC) in Drosophila fat cells, which requires a dynein-dynactin complex. This process is regulated by the small GTPases Rab7 and Rab39 together with their adaptors: Epg5 and ema, respectively. The dynein-dependent movement of vesicles toward the nucleus/ncMTOC is essential for efficient autophagosomal fusions with lysosomes and subsequent degradation. Remarkably, altering the balance of kinesin and dynein motors changes the direction of autophagosome movement, indicating a competitive relationship where normally dynein-mediated transport prevails. Since pre-fusion lysosomes were positioned similarly to autophagosomes, it indicates that pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes converge at the ncMTOC, which increases the efficiency of vesicle fusions.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Stabilization of the WNT effector {beta}-catenin promotes expression of mesoderm-specifying genes such as TBXT (which encodes Brachyury) and drives an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanical forces are essential for the self-organization and development of vertebrate embryos but the role of forces, especially actomyosin contractility, in mesoderm specification has remained controversial. We discovered that, unexpectedly, increasing actomyosin contractility by expression of constitutively active Rho kinase or MLC kinase, efficiently blocked any induction of mesoderm by WNT signaling, and cells failed to undergo EMT. Conversely, the suppression of contractility by inhibitors and genetic approaches significantly accelerated differentiation: Brachyury induction was enhanced, and EMT initiated 24hrs earlier than in control settings. These data were initially puzzling because we observed that WNT signaling was sufficient by itself to promote contractility of hiPSC colonies. Notably, however, we showed that contractility must be inhibited prior to WNT activation to efficiently promote mesoderm specification, suggesting that reduced tension primes the pluripotent state, not the induced state, to accelerate differentiation along this trajectory. Mechanistically, we found that loss of contractility decreased junctional {beta}-catenin and promoted active {beta}-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Increased contractility had opposite effects, highlighting actomyosin contractility at the pluripotent state as a key regulator of WNT signaling responsiveness through effects on adherens junctions.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Thus, mORs play a complex role in shaping the salience of distinct afferent inputs and transmitter modalities that ultimately influences synaptic recruitment of downstream GABAergic IPN neurons. Together, these observations provide a framework for future investigations aimed at identifying the neural underpinnings of maladaptive behaviors that can emerge when opioids, including potent synthetic analogs such as fentanyl, modulate or hijack this circuitry during the vulnerable stages of adolescence and in adulthood.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

The most common treatments have high rates of complications and early recurrence. Dupuytren lacks a staging biomarker profile to develop preventive therapeutics to improve long-term outcomes. This multi-omic study aimed to create a DD blood proteomic biomarker profile by comparing DD plasma to a healthy control group. We measured circulating collagen metabolism peptides and found normal Collagen I synthesis but impaired Collagen I degradation in DD. We measured 6995 serum protein aptamers and identified 68 proteins with statistically significant differences from the control group. We developed two Diagnostic Proteomic Risk Scores (DPRS) based on hypothesis-free and hypothesis-based analyses. In independent data, our hypothesis-free and hypothesis-based DPRS distinguished Dupuytren from control subjects with 76.5% and 70.6% accuracy, respectively. Our hypothesis-based DPRS also distinguished DD subjects with different disease progression rates based on subject age at the time of their first corrective procedure (p=0.0018). This pilot study is the first to provide evidence that Collagen I accumulation in DD is due to impaired degradation rather than increased collagen synthesis.

While coding variants in RET are known to impair enteric nervous system (ENS) development, the causal effects of pathogenic regulatory variants remain poorly understood. The largest contribution to HSCR risk is from a common variant (rs2435357) in an ENS-active, SOX10-bound RET enhancer (MCS+9.7) that reduces RET gene expression in vivo and triggers expression changes in other ENS genes in the human fetal gut. Here, we investigate the role of this enhancer in ENS development using a targeted mouse model by deleting this enhancer ({Delta}mcs9.7). Single-cell RNA-seq profiling of wildtype and {Delta}mcs9.7/ {Delta}mcs9.7 homozygote embryos at the developmental stage E14.5 revealed an ~8% decrease in Ret expression within ENS cell clusters, with no gross shifts in ENS cell type composition. Ret expression loss was limited to early differentiating neurons and inhibitory motor neurons, indicating cell type-specific enhancer control. To identify the Ret functional threshold for normal ENS development, we next generated a compound heterozygous mouse (+/{Delta}mcs9.7; +/CFP), heterozygous null for both the enhancer and coding (CFP) alleles, that showed additive reductions in Ret expression in these same cell types and bidirectional feedback between Ret and its transcription factor Sox10. We observed reduced expression of multiple cell cycle genes and significant loss of nNOS+ and VIP+ neurons in the E14.5 gut, consistent with decreased inhibitory neuron network function driven by loss of proliferation, the hallmark of HSCR. These findings established a cell type-specific role for the mcs9.7 enhancer in modulating Ret dosage and revealed how subtle enhancer perturbations alter neural subtype specification without overt aganglionosis.

Currently, there is no normalized approach for describing web structure and complexity, particularly for sheet-webs, and this methodology allows for non-destructive scanning and quantification of web characteristics. By analyzing the entropy of silk density distributions, a single scalar that captures the heterogeneity of material investment across the entire web, we observed that the entropy values follow a normal distribution with a mean of 1.24 +/- 0.22 bits when using 10 quantization levels. In the second part of the paper, by measuring the harmonicity of the silk density, we reveal that the silk density at a given point can be inferred from its neighbors, with an average harmonicity value of 0.0039 +/- 0.0017 (fraction of total points in point cloud data). The harmonic behavior is notable for its maximum principle, suggesting that the strongest parts of the web appear at the boundaries, aligning with existing knowledge of spider web construction.

A notable example of this task arises in paired-end read mapping as a form of validation of distances between multiple alignments. While straightforward for a single genome, graph-based reference structures render the operation considerably more involved. Given the sheer number of such queries in a typical read mapping experiment, an efficient algorithm for answering distance queries is crucial. In this paper, we introduce DiVerG, a compact data structure as well as a fast and scalable algorithm, for constructing distance indexes for general sequence graphs on multi-core CPU and many-core GPU architectures. DiVerG is based on PairG [Jain et al., 2019], but overcomes the limitations of PairG by exploiting the extensive potential for improvements in terms of scalability and space efficiency. As a consequence, DiVerG can process substantially larger datasets, such as whole human genomes, which are unmanageable by PairG. DiVerG offers faster index construction time and consistently faster query time with gains proportional to the size of the underlying compact data structure. We demonstrate that our method performs favorably on multiple real datasets at various scales. DiVerG achieves superior performance over PairG; e.g. resulting to 2.5-4x speed-up in query time, 44-340x smaller index size, and 3-50x faster construction time for the genome graph of the MHC region, as a particularly variable region of the human genome.

The effects of A{beta} monomer and oligomer half-lives - key indicators of proteolytic efficiency - on biological age are examined. Both constant and age-dependent (exponentially increasing) half-life scenarios are considered. The findings indicate that increasing the half-life of A{beta} monomers and oligomers with age accelerates biological aging. Reducing A{beta} monomer production is shown to slow biological aging, with a linear relationship established between these two quantities.

In our study, we demonstrate that Dopamine 2 Receptor (D2R+) expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) play key roles in interoception and interoceptive predictions. Specifically, these neurons are engaged in behaviors leading to physiologically relevant outcomes, with their activity highly dependent on the interoceptive state of the mice and the expected outcome.

LATS1 degradation was reversed by a proteasomal inhibitor, but not by lysosomal inhibitors, indicating that HCV promotes proteasomal degradation of LATS1. Cell-based ubiquitylation assays revealed that HCV infection induces K6- and K11-linked polyubiquitylation of LATS1. HCV-induced degradation of LATS1 was suppressed in si-Itch-transfected Huh-7.5 cells. Moreover, Itch overexpression enhanced LATS1 polyubiquitylation in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells. These results suggest that the Itch ubiquitin ligase is involved in LATS1 degradation. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 abolished LATS1 polyubiquitylation, suggesting that the HCV-induced ROS/JNK/Itch pathway promotes ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of LATS1. Moreover, cell fractionation assays and immunofluorescence staining revealed that HCV infection promotes nuclear translocation of YAP1 protein, suggesting suppression of the Hippo pathway.

Extracted DNA was analysed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect and quantify Mtb complex (MTBC) (rpoB, IS6110), HIV-1 (pol, gag) and Human (RPP30) gene copies. ddPCR sensitivity for Mtb was validated against Xpert-Ultra and culture. Total biopsy and intra-biopsy variation in pathogen DNA abundance, co-detection, and relationships to human cellularity, HIV status, and peripheral viral load (VL) evaluated. Results: ddPCR detected MTBC DNA in biopsies from 10/10 (100%) culture-confirmed STB, 5/6 (83%) Xpert Ultra-confirmed STB and 4/9 (44%) diagnosed Not STB (all 4 with previous pulmonary TB). Detected MTBC ranged from 8-59,144 rpoB copies/biopsy.

TRF1 loss increased the formation of micronuclei and cytosolic DNA, leading to ATR-dependent micronuclear rupture and activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. ATM activation enhanced STING K63 modification, thereby boosting the STING/NF{kappa}B pathway.

J.", "abstract": "Fibrotic diseases, often fueled by chronic inflammation, represent a major unmet medical need. A critical driver of this process is the activation of macrophages, which secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to immune cell recruitment and collagen deposition by myofibroblasts. Agonizing the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), expressed on macrophages, offers a potential therapeutic avenue to suppress this activation. Despite widespread interest in CB2 modulation, challenges remain in the development of small molecule agonists, including insufficient specificity and poor drug-like properties. Antibodies are highly specific with favorable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, but GPCR agonist antibodies have been difficult to discover. Here we present first-in-class CB2 agonist antibodies, AB120 and AB150. These antibodies are CB2 specific, G-alpha biased, and effectively decrease the expression of macrophage activation markers and key pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1{beta} and TNF-. Furthermore, using an ex vivo human precision-cut liver slice (hPCLS) model of liver fibrosis, we observe that treatment with these CB2 agonist antibodies not only reduces inflammatory markers but also significantly decreases collagen expression, indicating a potential to halt or reverse fibrosis. These novel CB2-specific agonist antibodies hold promise as therapeutics for a range of fibrotic and inflammatory conditions driven by chronic macrophage activation and demonstrate the potential of GPCR antibody agonists to drug this challenging class of targets.\n\nSignificance StatementFibrotic diseases driven by chronic inflammation lack effective treatments. CB2 agonism modulates macrophage activation to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines suggesting a novel avenue of treatment, but small molecule CB2 agonists have faced significant limitations due to off-target effects.

Rather, the sleep-onset period (SOP) exhibits dynamic and non-monotonous changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) with high, and so far poorly understood, intra- and inter-individual variability. Computational models of the sleep regulation network have suggested that the transition to sleep can be viewed as a noisy bifurcation at a saddle point which is determined by an underlying control signal or ``sleep drive''. However, such models do not describe how internal control signals in the SOP can produce rapid switches between stable wake and sleep states, nor how these state-space changes are translated in the macroscopic EEG. Here, we propose a minimally-parameterized stochastic dynamical model, in which one slowly-varying control parameter drives the wake-to-sleep transition while exhibiting noise-driven bistability. We provide a procedure for estimating the parameters of the model given single observations of experimental sleep EEG data, and show that it can reproduce a wide variety of SOP phenomenology. Using the model to analyze a pre-existing sleep EEG dataset, we find that the estimated model parameters correlate with subjective sleepiness reports.

Neurons communicate with the microvessels of the parenchyma to initiate a hemodynamic response, and these microvessels then communicate with upstream arterioles and arteries. The role of the larger feeding arteries--far upstream from the site of neuronal activity--in coordinating this response is incompletely understood, yet is important for the interpretation of fMRI. Functional Transcranial Doppler (fTCD) can noninvasively measure blood velocity changes in a subset of the largest macrovessels, albeit with poor spatial resolution, whereas existing functional MR angiography (fMRA) methods can assess blood velocity in mid-sized macrovessels but still lack the temporal resolution required to capture dynamic responses. This study aims to propose a new, quantitative fMRA method for measuring blood velocity responses in individual vessels in humans at high spatiotemporal resolution. A dynamic functional phase-contrast MRA approach was developed to quantify responses evoked by visual stimuli in the ''P2'' segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), located ~6 cm away from primary visual cortex. The achieved temporal resolution is comparable to that of conventional blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, enabling block-design stimulation paradigms similar to those used in conventional fMRI studies. The temporal and spatial properties of the blood velocity responses were evaluated using both long- and short-duration visual stimuli presented to either the full visual field or a single hemifield. Robust responses were measured on both 3T and 7T clinical MRI scanners, and an approximately 3.3 {+/-} 1.2 cm/s increase in the blood velocity in the targeted segment was observed, which is roughly a 10% increase from baseline. Visual hemifield stimulation generated a measurable blood velocity response only in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere, indicating that systemic physiological changes occurring with stimulation cannot account for the observed response, suggesting that they instead reflect neurovascular coupling initiated in the visual cortex. The observed arterial blood velocity response is consistent with a downstream reduction in microvascular resistance and may represent a passive response rather than an active vessel dilation at the targeted arterial segment. The proposed method has the potential to extend the capability of commonly used approaches, such as fTCD, in clinical applications.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

The catalytic efficiency of PLP-dependent enzymes is significantly higher than that of free PLP. The recruitment of PLP from the environment by the enzymes, particularly through interactions outside the active site, is the key step determining the occurrence of PLP-mediated catalysis. However, the precise mechanism by which enzymes recruit PLP remains elusive. Methionine {gamma}-lyase (MGL), a PLP-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the degradation of L-methionine, thereby suppressing cancer cell proliferation through serum or dietary methionine depletion. Here, we report the crystal structure of yMGL, which belongs to a newly identified subgroup of cystathionine {gamma}-lyases, in complex with L-methionine and PLP. Through truncating the C-terminal domain of yMGL both in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrated that this domain, outside the canonical PLP-binding domain, is essential for the specific interaction between yMGL and PLP, as well as for efficient L-methionine catabolism. A conserved Ser in the C-terminal domain, positioned at the active-site entrance of MGLs, confers specificity for PLP. These findings elucidate a previously uncharacterized mechanism of PLP recruitment by MGLs and promote rational design of MGLs with tailored cofactor selectivity and catalytic performance.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

For mathematical simplicity, rates of transition between compartments are generally assumed to be independent of the dwell time (or secondary time scale in survival analysis): they are either constant or dependent on the epidemiological time (or primary time scale in survival analysis) only, either directly (e.g. environmental or behavioral forcings in epidemiological models) or indirectly through dependence on other variables of the system (e.g. the force of infection in epidemiological models). In some domains of application, this memoryless assumption leads to distributions of dwelling times that are incompatible with those observed on data, which can lead to serious problems since the model predictions are highly sensitive on the exact shape of these distributions. Here we propose a deterministic, continuous-variable, numerical modelling approach that allows full flexibility on the dwell time distributions. The accompanying denim package provides a user-friendly interface to implement our proposed method through a dedicated language for model definition. The package is open-source and available on CRAN.

For patients who are not cured by surgery or for patients who present with distant metastatic disease, there is no known cure. T cell engagers (TCEs) are an emerging class of biologics that simultaneously bind to tumor cell surface antigens and the CD3 domain of T cells, thereby redirecting endogenous T cells to lyse and eliminate tumor cells. TCEs can mediate durable tumor regression, including complete responses, and are now approved to treat both multiple cancer types outside of MTC. RNASeq analysis of 30 MTC tumors, cross-referencing with public databases and an extensive literature review was used to identify CEA, DLL3 and GFRA4 as promising tumor antigens to target with TCEs. Expression of these antigens was then validated on MTC cell lines. Herein, I describe the discovery, application and development of MTC-targeted TCEs (MTCEs) recognizing the MTC tumor antigens CEA, DLL3 and GFRA4. In vitro, MTCEs mediate potent target-dependent and T cell-dependent cytotoxicity against MTC cell lines at concentrations of just 10 ng/mL. MTCEs also induce target-dependent IFNg secretion from T cells, with no measurable IFNg secretion observed in the presence of antigen-negative cell lines. Further, MTCEs are functionally compatible with the FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors selpercatinib and cabozantinib, and combination therapy numerically enhances cytotoxicity.

While auxin signalling is well established in this process, the role of membrane lipid signalling--particularly phosphoinositides--remains less understood. Here, we investigate the contribution of the anionic phospholipids PI4P, PI(4,5)P2, and phosphatidylserine (PS) to LR formation using live-cell biosensors, genetic mutants, and inducible lipid depletion tools. We show that PI4P is uniformly distributed throughout lateral root primordia (LRPs), whereas PI(4,5)P2 is specifically depleted in the proliferative core during early LRP development. Time-lapse imaging revealed stable PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 levels before and after FC activation, while PS increased rapidly post-activation. In xylem-pole pericycle (XPP) cells, PI(4,5)P2 decreased and PS increased following LR initiation, with both changes occurring in a membrane-domain-specific manner. Genetic analysis of the pip5k1pip5k2 double mutant, deficient in PI(4,5)P2 synthesis, revealed impaired LR initiation and emergence. Conversely, inducible depletion of PI(4,5)P2 using the iDePP system enhanced LRP initiation and accelerated development when activated after FC specification. These results suggest that PI4P functions as a stable basal lipid, while PI(4,5)P2 and PS undergo dynamic, spatially regulated changes critical for LR progression. Notably, PI(4,5)P2 acts as a negative regulator of LRP initiation and morphogenesis. Our findings highlight how lipid signalling, in coordination with hormonal cues, provides spatial and temporal control over pericycle cell behaviour and lateral root organogenesis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis study reveals how specific membrane lipids help control where and when new lateral roots form in plants. While plant hormones like auxin are known to guide root branching, this work shows that lipids such as PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylserine also play key roles. Using live imaging and genetic tools, we found that reducing PI(4,5)P2 in certain root cells promotes root growth by triggering cell division and development. In contrast, phosphatidylserine level increases right when root-forming cells become active. These discoveries highlight a new layer of control in plant development and suggest that lipids help fine-tune the formation of roots, which is essential for how plants take up water and nutrients.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular mechanisms governing its transcriptional regulatory activity remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that full-length MORC2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form nuclear condensates, a process essential for transcriptional repression. Endogenous MORC2 forms dynamic condensates in neurons from EGFP-MORC2 knock-in mice, supporting the physiological relevance of LLPS in vivo. The 3.1 [A] crystal structure of coiled-coil 3 (CC3) reveals a dimeric scaffold that drives phase separation, while multivalent interactions between the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a newly defined IDR-binding domain (IBD) further promote condensate formation. Moreover, LLPS enhances MORC2s ATPase activity in a DNA-dependent manner, indicating a functional coupling between phase separation, DNA binding, and enzymatic regulation. RNA-seq analysis shows that only wild-type, but not LLPS-deficient MORC2, represses core target genes in knockout cells, directly linking condensate formation to transcriptional control. Furthermore, disease-associated MORC2 variants alter condensate dynamics, ATPase activity, and DNA binding, offering mechanistic insights into their pathogenic effects. Together, these findings identify LLPS as a key regulatory mechanism for MORC2 function and provide a molecular framework for understanding its role in transcriptional regulation and human disease.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Resistance to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins is increasing in K. pneumoniae globally, restricting therapeutic options. The {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor combinations are widely used to circumvent {beta}-lactamase-mediated resistance. In 2021, isolate KpMVR1 was recovered from a hospitalised patient in England. Two additional isolates with the same variable-number tandem-repeat profile--KpMVS1, collected from the same patient 42 days before KpMVR1, and KpMVS2, from another patient in the same hospital--were susceptible to meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, and ceftazidime-avibactam. Illumina and nanopore whole-genome sequencing and hybrid genome assembly were conducted for these three isolates. Annotated genome assemblies were compared to identify genetic variation, and mutagenesis experiments were performed to verify predicted functional alterations. All isolates belonged to a novel clone ST8134 and carried blaKPC-2-like alleles (KpMVR1: blaKPC-157; KpMVS1 and KpMVS2: blaKPC-2) in presumptively conjugative plasmids. ISEc68 caused a frameshift mutation in KpMVR1's ompK36 gene, reducing the meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-relebactam susceptibility. KPC-157 demonstrated decreased hydrolysis of imipenem and ceftazidime when compared with KPC-2. KpMVR1 also encoded a disrupted transcriptional repressor MarR and a destabilising mutation in AcrB, a component of the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump. In conclusion, KpMVR1 harboured complex resistance-associated genetic alterations, with evidence for in vivo emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

E.; Li, X.; Shirhattikar, S. G.; Luo, T. T.; You, J.", "abstract": "Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) is an oncogenic human polyomavirus that latently infects most adults. Although the causative link between MCPyV and Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is well established, the molecular mechanisms that govern viral latency and prevent oncogenic progression remain poorly understood. We previously reported that the MCPyV early region protein ALTO is a key modulator of the STING-TBK1 signaling axis, enabling the virus to co-opt host innate immune pathways to suppress excessive viral replication and promote latency over transformation. In this study, we expand on this model by identifying a short, essential domain within ALTO that is required for TBK1 activation. This domain, which we term LIT (Lost in Tau), is necessary for ALTO-TBK1 interaction but dispensable for ALTO trafficking and its interactions with STING or Src. When expressed alone, the LIT domain functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of wild-type ALTO, competitively blocking TBK1 activation through a novel TBK1 interaction domain. Deletion of the LIT domain from ALTO not only abolishes TBK1 interaction and downstream phosphorylation but also eliminates TBK1-mediated suppression of MCPyV replication during early infection of human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). These findings provide mechanistic insight into how ALTO promotes viral persistence and immune evasion. More broadly, they highlight the functional importance of intrinsically disordered regions in modulating host-virus interactions and suggest that MCPyV latency is actively maintained through a finely tuned balance of pro- and anti-viral signaling. Targeting domains such as LIT may offer new strategies for regulating TBK1 activity or disrupting viral persistence.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Our lab has identified polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers as optimal nanocarriers to overcome delivery challenges to cartilage due to their positive charge and small size, which enables them to bind to cartilage and diffuse through tissue to deliver therapeutics to chondrocytes. Previously, we have developed and characterized dendrimers functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), demonstrating improved biocompatibility and enhanced transport through cartilage matrix. To improve the design of our therapeutic system, in this next phase of work, we characterized dendrimer-protein interactions or protein coronas that form on dendrimers after being immersed in synovial fluid. We also analyzed how synovial fluid protein coronas affect biological outcomes of dendrimers in synovial joints, specifically uptake in cartilage and internalization by chondrocytes. We identified that protein coronas can reduce dendrimer uptake in cartilage and chondrocytes; however, uptake reduction is mitigated by varying PEG chain length and density. Although protein coronas can be perceived as \"biological barriers\" to uptake, we demonstrate that dendrimers conjugated with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have better engagement with IGF-1 receptors after being pre-coated with a synovial fluid protein corona. Overall, these studies offer further insight into the mechanisms of how positively charged dendrimers target and transport through cartilage, bridging knowledge gaps between ex vivo and in vivo work.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=127 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/668990v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7eae5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8b3b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16cea54org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18c5675_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Yet, rapid cooling during freezing may not preserve the conformations at physiological temperature. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations starting with cryo-EM reconstructions can provide additional insights. For example, at 310 K the states of ADP-actin filaments consistent with higher entropy favor partly twisted subunits and smaller rotations along short-pitch helix than the cryo-EM reconstructions, while cryogenic temperatures favor flattened conformations. In the active site, the positions of Q137 and the catalytic water 1 and activating water 2 optimal for in line attack on the {gamma}-phosphate of ATP are very rare at 310 K, explaining in part the slow rate of ATP hydrolysis in filaments. This favorable arrangement of the waters is not observed in simulations of actin monomers. At 310 K subunits in ADP-Pi-actin filaments have their backdoor gates open 60% of the time for phosphate release, a conformation not observed by cryo-EM. Rare fluctuations open binding sites for cofilin and phalloidin. The twisted conformations of pointed end subunits and interactions of the D-loop of the penultimate subunit explain the slow association of new subunits. The terminal subunit at the barbed end is tethered to its neighbor along the long-pitch helix but transiently dissociates from its lateral neighbor. These effects of subfreezing temperatures on actin filaments are surely not an isolated example, so MD simulations of structures of other frozen proteins will be informative.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

While much of the existing research has focused on reward-based learning, the contribution of reward-independent learning processes to this imbalance remains unclear. To address this gap, the present study investigated the interaction between statistical learning (SL), a form of reward-free learning, and cognitive flexibility, a key goal-directed function, in a non-clinical population. By adopting a dimensional approach to obsessive-compulsive (OC) tendencies, this work aims to overcome the limitations of categorical diagnoses and better capture the continuous, nuanced variability of symptoms, while clarifying how specific neurocognitive processes relate to OC tendencies. A total of 402 participants from the non-clinical population completed an online study involving the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task to assess SL and a Card Sorting Task to measure cognitive flexibility. Our findings revealed a competitive relationship between SL and cognitive flexibility. Critically, this inverse association weakened as OC tendencies increased, suggesting that even at non-clinical levels, OC tendencies may interfere with the typical interplay between automatic and goal-directed processes. Notably, SL performance remained intact, and the observed effects were not attributable to reward sensitivity, as learning occurred without external feedback. These findings emphasize the value of examining non-clinical OC tendencies and highlight the importance of investigating neurocognitive system interactions, rather than isolated functions, in advancing our understanding of OCD.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

A wealth of studies indicate that dopamine activity encodes discrepancy between actual and predicted reward, leading to the reward prediction error (RPE) hypothesis. Specifically, it has been claimed that mesolimbic dopamine activity conforms to temporal-difference reward prediction error (TD RPE), a teaching signal in machine learning algorithms. Recently, there is growing evidence suggesting that dopamine is also involved in learning during aversive situations. However, the fundamental computation of dopamine activity in aversive situations is still unknown. A plausible but untested hypothesis is that dopamine activity in aversive situations also encodes TD RPE. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using mice in virtual reality. Mice were trained to avoid electrical tail shocks by running out of a virtual shock zone. Using probe conditions with speed manipulation or teleportation, we revealed that the dopamine signal in the ventral striatum follows the temporal derivative form of a value function. Delivering a reward at the end of the track enabled us to observe the integration of aversion and reward in a derivative form. Moreover, the value functions unbiasedly estimated from the recorded signal is consistent with the initial hypothetical form, with a realistic reflection of a received shock distribution. Taken together, our results show that mesolimbic dopamine activity can operate as a unified teaching signal in natural situations with positive and negative valences.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Moreover, unlike the robustness shown by their counterparts, the terminal Schwann cells, we strikingly observed that kranocytes rapidly detected stressful conditions, leading to structural changes and even the loss of their connections in response to acute damage, such as muscle injury or neuromuscular disease-induced denervation. Therefore, we propose kranocytes as the interactive sensory platforms of the NMJs, working in a perpendicular axis of nerve-transmission, as key NMJ-connectors by, interconnecting adjacent NMJs and interacting with the microvasculature and the microenvironment, and also as NMJ-sensors by detecting microenvironmental inputs. Together, our data postulate kranocytes as triple connectors of the nervous, musculoskeletal and vascular systems.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Humans are proficient in detecting even subtle regularities in their sensory inputs. In the specific context of vision, one manifestation of this ability is the perception of structures embedded in noisy backgrounds. Here we use electrophysiology to explore the neural correlates of this proficiency. Observers underwent EEG recordings while being presented with random-dot displays. A few dots in some of the displays were arranged in a line. The results reveal that the two kinds of displays, those with and without the embedded lines, though identical in low-level attributes such as mean luminance and spatial frequency distribution, elicit markedly different neural responses. We find that the first divergence in the ERPs corresponding to these two stimulus classes occurs around 100 milliseconds. These differences are evident in occipital sensors suggesting that the perceptual distinction between structured and non-structured stimuli is accomplished in the very early cortical stages of visual processing. The short latency and early locus of the ERP divergence point to a largely feedforward computation underlying this feat of perceptual organization. The functional connectivity for difference between the two events also supports the ERP findings and thus, exhibits relation between synchrony time-course and ERP dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

E.; Balc\u0131, F.", "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by impaired social interactions and communication and increased repetitive and stereotypical behaviour. Neuroimaging shows functional abnormalities in brain areas involved in temporal processing of autistic individuals, and autistic individuals show deficits in interval timing. Neurexin (NRXN) mutations have been identified in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASD, and Nrxn1+/- mice possess a mutation that disrupts the , {beta}, and {gamma} isoforms of Nrxn1, a gene involved in synapse structure. We investigated the interval timing abilities of the Nrxn1+/- mouse model of ASD in the peak interval procedure using a 15-second target interval and compared their performance with that of Nrxn1+/+ and Nrxn1{Delta}S5/- rescue mice. Two-month-old male Nrxn1+/+ (C57BL/6J), Nrxn1+/-, and Nrxn1{Delta}S5/-, mice were trained to obtain sucrose liquid rewards 15s after the onset of a discriminative stimulus (discrete fixed-interval training), and their timing responses were tested in non-reinforced probe trials. Our analysis of responses in individual trials revealed that Nrxn1+/- mice had overall earlier timing responses. This difference was manifested as earlier termination of responding in terms of the response curves. These findings are consistent with leftward shifts observed with experimental animal models of ASD. In conclusion, we believe that these results are indicative of a biased long-term memory in the Nrxn1+/- mouse model of ASD and may capture the timing deficit observed in autistic individuals. Lay Summary: Neurexins help nerve cells connect and communicate with each other, and changes in these genes are often seen in people with autism. Mice with a change in their neurexin 1 gene, called Nrxn1+/- mice, show autism-like behaviours. In a test that involves judging time, these mice respond early, similar to some people with autism. This study helps develop our understanding of how interval timing is affected in ASD.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

M.; Jimenez, V.; Nguyen, B.; Duvernay, J.; Choi, S.; Cameron, M.; Killinger, B. A.; Gupta, V.", "abstract": "The pathology of Parkinson's disease is defined by -synuclein (-syn) aggregation into neuronal Lewy bodies, which may lead to chronic neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Misfolded -syn activates Toll-like receptor signaling in microglia, leading to downstream activation of NF-{kappa}B and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines recruit pro-inflammatory myeloid cells from circulation, thereby amplifying neuroinflammation. Thus, reducing microglial activation and myeloid cell infiltration has the potential to reduce neuroinflammation and PD pathology. Here, we investigated a targeted immunomodulatory strategy using LA1, a novel, small-molecule agonist of CD11b, a {beta}2 integrin receptor highly and selectively expressed on myeloid cells and microglia. CD11b has key roles in cell adhesion, migration, and phagocytosis. Previous work has demonstrated that CD11b agonism via LA1 transiently enhances integrin-mediated adhesion that limits immune cell transmigration and tissue infiltration. CD11b agonism also suppresses TLR-driven inflammatory signaling and myeloid cell activation. To evaluate its efficacy in vivo, we utilized pre-clinical Parkinson's disease model by stereotaxically delivering AAV2-SYN to induce -synuclein overexpression in the murine midbrain. Mice were treated with oral LA1 for four or eight weeks and analyzed. LA1 treatment significantly reduced microglial activation and decreased brain infiltration of peripheral immune cells, thereby attenuating -synuclein-induced neuroinflammation. These findings suggest that CD11b agonism may offer a dual-action therapeutic approach in Parkinson's disease by dampening pro-inflammatory responses by central and peripheral myeloid cells.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Some genetic determinants could contribute to synapse frailty toward AD pathology. However, the role of genetic determinants in AD pathogenesis remains poorly understood at the synaptic level. Here, we show that the expression of an isoform of the major AD susceptibility gene BIN1 in the presynaptic compartment results in synaptic loss. Using electrophysiology, we observed an early loss of synaptic transmission upon BIN1 isoform 1 (BIN1iso1) expression in Drosophila retinal photoreceptor neurons. This was not observed for the other human BIN1 isoforms tested, isoform 8 and isoform 9. Structural analysis of photoreceptor neuron synapses shows a strong accumulation of abnormally large vesicles in the presynaptic compartment, reminiscent of this same isoform-induced endosome defects in cell bodies. In addition, the expression of BIN1iso1 in motoneurons of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction alters the morphology of synaptic boutons, with a greater number and a smaller size of synaptic boutons, and the appearance of satellite boutons. As opposed to endosomal defects in cell body, modulating the Rab11 recycling endosome regulator did not prevent BIN1iso1 synaptotoxicity. To test if synaptic deficits are conserved in a mammalian model and to assert a presynaptic vs postsynaptic role for BIN1, we used rat primary neurons cultured in microfluidic devices that restrict gene expression modulation in particular neuron populations. We found a loss of synaptic connectivity only when expressing BIN1iso1 in the presynaptic compartment, which was confirmed by microelectrode array analysis. Together, our results suggest that BIN1 expression in the presynaptic terminal, but not the postsynaptic terminal leads to an isoform-specific, deleterious effect on synaptic integrity. BIN1 synaptotoxicity could contribute to the synapse loss observed early in AD. This supports the idea that genetic determinants could make synapses prone to failure in AD.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

We introduce a method for the selective isolation of microglial nuclei from fresh-frozen brain tissue using the transcription factor PU.1 as a nuclear marker. To stabilize PU.1 for reliable detection, a brief formaldehyde fixation step is applied. The protocol is fully compatible with Smart-seq3xpress, a high-sensitivity, full-length transcriptomic method offering isoform- and allele-level resolution, making the workflow scalable and cost-efficient. We benchmarked the method in a mouse model of ischemic stroke, evaluating both technical performance and its ability to capture biologically meaningful microglial states. Compared to standard single-nucleus protocols, our approach yielded higher gene and UMI counts and a greater proportion of coding reads. Transcriptomic profiles closely matched those from whole-cell RNA- sequencing including the detection of activation markers and diverse microglial subpopulations.

These local spectral changes were accompanied by enhanced frontoposterior theta phase synchrony and network hub strength, predicting higher behavioral accuracy.

Astrocytes integrate metabolic and hormonal cues and sustain cell-autonomous rhythms, implicating them as candidate links between energy state and central circadian control. Here we show that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hypothalamic astrocytes exhibits intrinsic, calcium-dependent rhythmicity that persists under constant darkness and without feeding cues. This glial rhythm sustains time-of-day phosphorylation programmes in the hypothalamus and stabilises the clock protein PER2 via phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue, thereby linking metabolic state to period control beyond the canonical transcription-translation feedback loops. In the ventromedial hypothalamus, astrocytic AMPK-PER2 signalling is required for food-anticipatory activity, identifying a glial node within the food-entrainable timing system. Disrupting astrocytic AMPK rhythmicity alters circadian behaviour and energy homeostasis and shortens lifespan in a sex-dependent manner. These findings recast AMPK as a metabolically adaptive glial timekeeper that connects calcium signalling and phosphorylation rhythms to behaviour and metabolism. They also reveal a phosphorylation-based timing layer in central metabolic circuits, with implications for circadian-metabolic misalignment in contexts such as shift work and metabolic disorders.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Methods: We constructed a 50-variable evidence model integrating structural, molecular, and circuit-level data from published literature. This framework generated a PASS-validated synthetic cohort of 10,000 virtual subjects, with validation details in the Appendix. Analyses employed causal inference with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), mediation analysis, factorial ANOVA, and the Two One-Sided Test [TOST] for equivalence. The model predictive fit was deliberately modest (RMSE = 0.499; R square = -0.010), focusing on causal insights rather than precise prediction. Evaluations were stratified by timing and circuit integrity. Results: Causal analysis revealed a weak, nonsignificant direct effect of Purkinje cell density on seizure burden (ATE = +0.0045, 95% CI: -0.0053 to +0.0143) [Table 1, row 1]. Mediation via GABAergic pathways was negligible. Early stimulation ([&le;]4 days post-onset) significantly reduced seizure burden (p = 0.045, mean Delta; = -0.020), with a timing x integrity interaction [Table 1, row 3]. Factorial ANOVA confirmed this interaction (F = 3.30, p = 0.019, partial eta square= 0.001), with Tukey HSD emphasizing timing role. TOST with a +/-0.015 margin did not confirm equivalence for Purkinje effects (P1; = 0.0019, ;P2;= 0.136), suggesting minimal impact. Sensitivity and perturbation tests across 10,000-subject cohorts ensured robustness. Interpretation: This model suggests cerebellar stimulation mitigates seizure burden through timely intervention rather than Purkinje integrity. Recent studies support cerebellar changes in TLE and rTMS-induced vermis volume increases linked to seizure reduction.Trials of transcranial alternating current stimulation in refractory TLE align with our findings. Results from synthetic data propose translational validation.

HTT loss-of-function, caused by haploinsufficiency of the wild type HTT gene (wtHTT), is an important feature of HD pathophysiology that has previously been understudied compared to mutant HTT gain-of-function mechanisms. wtHTT is essential for nervous system development and functions as a scaffolding protein to support many vital cellular functions including axonal transport, autophagy and synaptic plasticity. Here, we examined the consequences of wtHTT deletion in the adult striatum by conditionally inactivating wtHTT in 2-4 month old male and female Httfl/fl mice. wtHTT loss of function in mature SPNs decreased intrinsic neuronal excitability and produced a neuroinflammatory response in these mice, while tissue organization, spine morphology and motor behaviour remained unaffected.

However, a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of how hormonal pathways orchestrate human neurodevelopment remains elusive. Here we present a multi-scale high resolution atlas of endocrine signalling in human neural organoids through systematic perturbations with agonists and inhibitors of seven key hormonal pathways: androgen (AND), estrogen (EST), glucocorticoid (GC), thyroid (THY), retinoic acid (RA), liver X (LX), and aryl hydrocarbon (AH). By integrating bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, high-throughput imaging and targeted steroidomics, we mapped the molecular and cellular consequences of their physiologically relevant perturbations. Retinoic acid exerted the most profound effect, promoting neuronal differentiation and maturation, consistent with its established role as a patterning factor. Our analysis further benchmarked neural organoids for in vitro endocrinology and neurotoxicology by confirming previously reported in vivo effects, such as induction of mTOR signalling by AND, alteration of disease relevant genes by GC and enhanced differentiation by TH. Furthermore, we observed that LX activation upregulates genes involved in cholesterol metabolism while AH inhibition promotes neuronal differentiation. We next uncovered extensive crosstalks between these endocrine pathways, as in the paradigmatic convergence induced by AND agonist and inhibitors of GC, TH, and LX, affecting genes related to protein folding and metabolic regulation, as also highlighted by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Single-cell analyses pinpointed cell-type-specific responses to hormonal challenges, such as the caudalization of progenitors and neurons upon RA activation and the depletion of specific neurodevelopmental states upon AH activation. Finally, we dissected the cytoarchitectural and morphometric impact of hormonal perturbations and demonstrated that neural organoids possess active steroidogenic pathways that are functionally modulated by the tested compounds. This atlas provides a systematic quantification of the hormonal impact on human neurodevelopment, enabling the investigation of uncharted aspects in the developmental origins of neuropsychiatric traits.

We found that: (1) larger groups compensated for reduced per-capita foraging efficiency by expanding into less-exploited areas over longer timescales rather than increasing daily travel; (2) range expansion by large groups was disproportionately directed toward smaller neighbors; (3) during the dry season, resource confinement to riparian zones reduced spatial overlap but increased intergroup encounters, especially in more productive areas; and (4) larger groups held higher-quality ranges in the dry season while maintaining consistent fruit intake across seasons, suggesting that benefits of between-group competitive ability offset within-group costs during resource-scarce conditions.

However the mutational mechanisms driving these duplications and the regulatory changes enabling novel expression patterns remain poorly understood. The primate amylase locus, marked by independent gene duplications, provides an ideal model to investigate these dynamics. Leveraging high-quality genome assemblies from 53 primates and multi-tissue transcriptomes from Old World monkeys, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the recurrent gene duplications across the primate phylogeny. Our data suggest that lineage-specific LTR retrotransposon insertions are associated with initial structural instability, while subsequent duplications are primarily driven by non-allelic homologous recombination. Recurrent independent duplications in rhesus macaques, olive baboons, and great apes gave rise to distinct amylase gene copies with convergent expression in the pancreas and salivary glands. We found that these independent gene duplications are accompanied by episodic diversifying selection on lineage-specific copies, likely driving the emergence of functional divergence. Our comparative analyses in primates indicate that the gene ancestral to great ape AMY1 and AMY2A was expressed in both salivary glands and pancreas in the Catarrhini ancestor. The great ape-specific duplication of this ancestral gene likely facilitated subfunctionalization into salivary gland- and pancreas-specific expression, respectively. Comparative analysis of primate amylase promoter regions reveals regulatory rewiring, driven by motif turnover mediated by structural rearrangements, and partially explaining evolutionary shifts in expression. Together, our findings highlight how structural and regulatory modularity in complex genomic regions drives evolutionary innovation and molecular convergence, and we provide a genomic framework for dissecting these processes across diverse lineages.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Based on our Big-IN technology for scarless genome engineering, we have developed a high-throughput multiplexed delivery pipeline to analyze >100 engineered payloads in hundreds of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) clones. We characterize multiple heterotypic DHS combinations from different critical mESC regulator loci, all delivered in a constant chromosomal context replacing the Sox2 Locus Control Region (LCR). We identify widespread examples of context-dependent enhancers which have no activity on their own but can double the activity of a neighboring DHS. We find pervasive context dependencies that depend on the specific DHS pairings. We further show that synergy between neighboring DHSs decays as a characteristic function of distance, with its influence extending up to several kilobases. We fine map this context dependency to the contribution of individual transcription factor recognition sequences. Our approach implicates the specific sequence and architectural features underpinning pervasive genomic context effects, and outlines key directions for modeling the functional impact of noncoding regulatory variation on common human traits and diseases.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

The necessity of this unique mechanism remains unsubstantiated, as does the role of recursive splicing (RS) in human disease. From analyses of rare copy number variants (CNVs) from almost one million individuals, we previously identified large, heterozygous deletions eliminating an RS site (RS1) in the first intron of CADM2 that conferred substantial risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other neurobehavioral traits. CADM2 encodes a neuronally expressed cell adhesion molecule that has repeatedly been associated with ADHD and numerous similar traits. To explore the molecular impact of RS ablation in CADM2, we used CRISPR to model patient deletions and to target a smaller region (~500 base pairs) containing RS1 in both human induced neurons (iNs) and rats. Transcriptome analyses in unedited iNs provided a catalog of CADM2 transcripts, including novel transcripts that retained RS exons. Intriguingly, ablating RS1 altered the gradient of RNA abundance across the first intron of CADM2, decreased the level of CADM2 expression, and impacted transcript usage. Decreased CADM2 expression was reflected in reduced exon usage downstream of the RS1 site and global alteration to genes involved in neuronal processes including synapse and axon development. Given the scale of our analyses and the widespread association of CADM2 with neurobehavioral traits, we sought to validate these findings using in vivo models and found that rodent models harboring Cadm2 RS1 deletions exhibited significant changes in relevant behaviors and functional brain connectivity. In summary, our analyses demonstrate a functional role for RS as a noncoding regulatory mechanism in a gene associated with a spectrum of neuropsychiatric and behavioral traits.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

In a subset of MDD patients inflammatory processes accompany the disease and this has also been reported for other psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia (SZ). However, little is known regarding immune deregulation in relation to clinical symptoms. Methods: Cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-Seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with MDD (n=22), SZ (n=10), and healthy controls (HCs, n=26) was performed, yielding 633,284 high-quality single-cell profiles. Differential gene expression, cell composition, pathway enrichment, and weighted gene co-expression network analyses were conducted. MDD symptom severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), enabling the correlation of gene expression with individual disease symptoms. Results: We identified disease-specific transcriptomic signatures for MDD as well as for SZ and shared gene expression changes between the two conditions. For MDD, monocyte numbers were elevated concomitant with a strong enrichment of interferon signaling. The MDD-specific signature involving all peripheral cell types correlated strongly with key symptoms of depression like sadness or pessimism. Reactome analysis identified nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB)-associated pathways among the genes positively correlating with disease symptoms and traits.

Here, we develop a coarse-grained whole-cell model of bacterial physiology that integrates proteome allocation, metabolic fluxes, and cell geometry with physical limits on cell surface area and intracellular diffusion. Our model shows that the efficiency of cellular growth is not monotonic with nutrient availability; instead, it peaks precisely at the onset of overflow metabolism, framing this metabolic switch as an optimal trade-off between efficient use of imported nutrients and rapid growth. By simulating perturbations to cell morphology, we demonstrate the strong metabolic advantage of a high surface-to-volume ratio, which consistently improves growth efficiency. Finally, we show how geometric limits on growth efficiency result in a hard physical constraint: the maximum sustainable cell size is inversely related to the growth rate. This is due to a fundamental conflict between the proteomic cost of growth speed and the cost of size, which creates a budget crisis in large, fast-growing cells. Our work shows how a few physical rules define the allowable strategies for bacterial metabolism and provides a mechanistic explanation for the observed limits on microbial cell size and growth.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

We have reported that continuous exposure to hypoxia partially rescues RGC death in these mice, with minimal effect on MNP abundance. We hypothesized that pharmacological depletion of MNPs with the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitor pexidartinib would enhance RGC neuroprotection by hypoxia. Methods: Iba1+ retinal MNP depletion was assessed in C57Bl/6J mice fed control or pexidartinib-infused chow beginning at P25. Subsequently, Vglut2-Cre;ndufs4loxP/loxP mice and control littermates were raised under normoxia or hypoxia and fed control or pexidartinib chow from P25 to P90. The neuroprotective effect of pexidartinib and hypoxia alone and in combination was assessed by quantifying RGC soma and axon survival in retinal flat mounts and optic nerve cross sections. Results: Pexidartinib completely depleted retinal MNPs within one week of treatment. Untreated Vglut2-Cre;ndufs4loxP/loxP mice exhibited the expected ~50% reduction of RGC soma and axon survival at P90 (p<0.0001 for both). Hypoxia or pexidartinib monotherapy each reduced RGC degeneration by more than one-half, while their combination resulted in complete RGC neuroprotection (p<0.001 for all three treatments). Normal myelination patterns were restored in mice receiving dual therapy. Conclusions: Pexidartinib effectively depletes retinal MNPs and is neuroprotective in the setting of severe RGC mitochondrial dysfunction. This therapeutic effect is additive to that of hypoxia. Combating retinal neuro-inflammation may therefore be a useful adjunct therapy in mitochondrial optic neuropathies like Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify stress-induced nuclear import as a key regulator of RNA synthesis recovery (RRS). Inhibition of IMP/{beta}1-dependent nuclear import sensitizes cells to UV irradiation by impairing RRS, without affecting DNA repair. We further show that a fraction of the RNA/DNA exonuclease EXD2 translocates from the mitochondria to the nucleus in response to UV-induced stress. In the nucleus, EXD2 interacts with RNAPII, promotes degradation of nascent mRNA, and facilitates transcription restart. Disruption of EXD2's nuclear localization signal mimics import inhibition, abolishing its interaction with RNAPII, blocking RRS, and reducing cell survival after UV exposure. Remarkably, forced nuclear localization of EXD2 restores RRS and UV resistance, even when nuclear import is compromised. Strikingly, persistent nuclear localization of EXD2 in the absence of stress is detrimental, causing mitotic defects. Our findings establish stress-induced IMP/{beta}1-dependent nuclear import as a critical DDR checkpoint, identify EXD2 as its key effector, and underscore the importance of spatial and temporal control of nuclease activity in maintaining genome stability.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

It is also a key structural component, being essential to maintain the integrity of the cell. In plants, many plasma membrane proteins have been shown to bind cell wall components, but with no obvious structural role. Conversely, the formation of Hechtian strands has revealed the existence of stiff structural hotspots, where plasma membrane is glued to the cell wall, even in the absence of plasmodesmata. However, the molecular factors behind this behavior remain elusive. Here, we bridge these two angles. Through a screen of candidate proteins, we reveal that the receptor-like kinase LecRKI.9 plays the role of a strong molecular glue at the plant cell cortex. Through deletion experiments, we find that the adhesive function of LecRKI.9 requires the presence of a lectin domain. Upon hyperosmotic stress, LecRKI.9 formed immobile clusters, whereas lectin-deleted versions of LecRKI.9 clusters were mobile. Cluster size and density correlated with the expected magnitude of mechanical stress in the wall before plasmolysis, further suggesting that the development of stiff adhesive hotspots through LecRKI.9 is regulated by stress in the wall. Altogether, this provides a scenario in which a subclass of lectin receptor-like kinases patterns the plasma membrane through stiff attachment sites, in response to stress.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Despite these advances, it remains unclear how introns, particularly rare intron classes, are organized within the 3D genome and whether this organization influences their splicing. Here, we mapped the spatial organization of six intron classes including major, minor, minor-like, hybrid, major-like and non-canonical across four human cell lines (K562, H1, HCT116, and HFFc6) using Hi-C, TSA-seq, and DamID-seq data. This revealed minor intron enrichment in active compartments A and speckle-associated domains (SPADs) and depletion from lamina-associated domains (LADs), whereas hybrid and non-canonical introns showed the opposite trend. Integrating TSA-seq with RNA-seq data suggested that splicing efficiency depends on intron identity rather than nuclear positioning. For example, major-like, minor-like, and non-canonical introns in SPADs were less efficiently spliced than major and minor introns despite their proximity to nuclear speckles. These patterns were consistent across cancer (K562, HCT116) and stem cells (H1) but not fibroblasts (HFFc6). Comparison of minor intron splicing in and out of SPADs across cell lines revealed that, relative to fibroblasts, minor introns outside of SPADs in cancer cells were more efficiently spliced. This suggests that increased efficiency of minor intron splicing in cancer cell lines is not necessarily due to 3D positioning.

However, little is known about their interactions with the fibrinolytic pathway, their ability to alter clot structure or to support the activated protein C (APC) pathway. Previous studies used membrane liposome compositions that differ from those expected physiologically and/or generated inconsistent findings. To address this, pro-coagulant membranes comprising physiological proportions of aPL and eoxPL will be tested for their ability to support fibrinolysis using standard assays. Methods: The impact of phospholipids on clot structure and clot lysis was tested using absorbance-based assays. To investigate the impact of PS or eoxPL on fibrinolysis, plasmin was monitored chromogenically, and clot dissolution measured in a purified lysis system activated by tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase. To determine the impact of eoxPL on APC/protein S, FVa was incubated with APC (+/- protein S) in a purified prothrombinase assay. Results: At the concentrations of lipids tested in our study, PS did not significantly impact clot structure or fibrinolysis. Similarly, eoxPL did not impact either fibrinolysis or activity of APC/Protein S.

Vagal sensory nerves are well known to detect visceral signals and regulate physiological functions, including feeding, metabolism and immunity. However, their role in thermoregulation remains poorly understood. Cholecystokinin (CCK), a gut hormone released postprandially, activates vagal sensory nerves via CCK-A receptors (CCK-AR). Exogenous CCK has been reported to induce thermogenesis in the intrascapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), but the involvement of vagal sensory nerves and the central neural mechanisms that mediate this effect are not fully understood. In this study, we assessed the thermogenic effect of intraperitoneally (I.P.) administered CCK-8 and investigated the underlying autonomic reflex pathways. I.P. CCK-8 transiently and dose-dependently increased rectal temperature. This response was significantly attenuated by pharmacological blockade of CCK-AR, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy, or knockdown of CCK-AR primarily targeting in vagal sensory neurons. In addition, CCK-8 activated sympathetic nerve activity via vagal afferents. CCK-8-induced thermogenesis was blunted by iBAT sympathectomy or {beta}3-adrenergic receptor blockade. Furthermore, I.P. CCK-8 activated oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVHOXT). Chemogenetic inhibition of PVHOXT neurons or intracerebroventricular administration of an oxytocin receptor (OXTR) antagonist attenuated the thermogenic response.

Previous studies have examined this phenomenon mainly with simple stimuli varying only in low-level visual features, leaving it unclear whether the same principles apply to natural scenes. To address this, we investigated surround suppression in complex and dynamic scenes by systematically manipulating categorical similarity and motion congruence between the center and surrounding scenes. Categorical similarity was examined across four levels: identical exemplars, different exemplars of the same basic-level category, different basic-level categories, and different superordinate categories. Motion direction was manipulated by center and surround drifting either in the same or opposite directions. In two experiments, we measured contrast sensitivity for the center scene during a categorization task. We found that the suppression increased as the categorical similarity between the center and the surround decreased, with the strongest suppression observed for different superordinate categories. This contrasts with results for simple stimuli, where increasing center-surround similarity increases suppression. Yet, consistent with the findings from simple stimuli, suppression was stronger when the center and surround moved in the same direction. These findings show that contextual modulation in natural vision is governed not only by low-level feature similarity but also by high-level categorical structure. Context-dependent suppression may therefore help the visual system prioritize coherent, task-relevant information while filtering incongruent input.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Developed organoids contain basal cell progenitors and a spectrum of differentiated epithelial subtypes, including secretory, ciliated, PNECs, and hillock cells. Hyperoxia exposure and treatment with dexamethasone caused significant cellular transcriptional changes and highlighted biological pathways, both known and novel, with distinct findings based on sex as a biological variable.

Indeed, mixotrophic organisms have the ability to combine photosynthetic and heterotrophic nutrition. Here, we focus on an iconic group of mixotrophic protists, Rhizaria. They are particularly delicate and are often crushed by standard plankton nets. Rhizaria are a very good model organism to study mixotrophy in plankton because they are easily observed in their environment by in situ imaging, allowing us to monitor their true ecological mixotrophic behaviour. While their substantial contribution to planktonic biomass has recently been revealed, their trophic ecology is poorly described -- some taxa are mixotrophic and host photosynthetic symbionts, others are not -- and knowledge of their reproductive cycle is even scarcer. Using high-frequency in situ imaging, we study the ecology of these mixotrophic organisms directly in their undisturbed environment. We examined the fine-scale distribution and orientation of ~230,000 organisms belonging to three groups of Rhizaria, including the mixotrophic taxa Acantharia and Collodaria, and the non-mixotrophic Phaeodaria. Overall, our results suggest that mixotrophic protists have better ability to control their position within the water column (depth, orientation) than non-mixotrophic ones. Our observations also point to several steps in the obscure life cycle of the mixotrophic Collodaria, during which de novo symbiont acquisition appears to involve active fine-scale buoyancy control. Taken together, these unprecedented results demonstrate that complex ecological behaviour can be achieved by \"simple\" single-celled organisms.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a machine learning model to predict siRNA efficacy directly from intrinsic antisense sequence features. Using a dataset of 2,428 experimentally val-idated siRNAs, we developed a comprehensive feature set that encompasses sequence composition, regulatory motifs, thermo-dynamic parameters, and structural complexity. We trained and evaluated multiple models for both regression and classi-fication tasks.

Static storage at 10C has been shown to extend ischemia times and improve lung health. Given that lungs can maintain aerobic metabolism ex vivo, we hypothesized that adding ventilation at 10C would further prolong preservation by stimulating aerobic metabolism. Methods: Lungs were procured from C57Bl/6 mice and then stored for 24h with ventilation at 10C (n=4), statically at 10C (n=4), or statically at 4C (n=4). Respiratory mechanics were evaluated using a FlexiVent system. Cellular viability was assessed via flow cytometry. Complement shedding was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Histologic evidence of lung injury was assessed by H&E staining. Results: Donor lungs stored with ventilation at 10C exhibited significantly reduced histologic injury scores compared to static storage at 4C (p = 0.0062). Ventilation also decreased complement C3 shedding (p < 0.01), apoptosis (p < 0.05), cytochrome c release (p = 0.0014), and ROS production (p = 0.0008) compared to statically stored lungs at 4C and 10C. Functionally, ventilated lungs demonstrated improved respiratory mechanics with lower airway resistance (p = 0.021) and increased compliance (p = 0.023) compared to static storage at 10C. Conclusions: Ventilating lungs at 10C compared to static cold storage appears to result in healthier and more functional lung tissue and may extend the preservation times of donor organs for lung transplantation.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Here we genetically induce intestinal immune activation in Drosophila and stratify animals by their intestinal barrier status using the Smurf assay. We demonstrate that intestinal immune activation and barrier failure have distinct impacts on the microbiota. Further, intestinal immune activation drives intestinal barrier failure and mortality even in the absence of the microbiota. Importantly, immune-induced intestinal barrier failure takes time to develop and is closely associated with the onset of mortality. Our work adds to building evidence that the impact of intestinal permeability on the microbiota and on animal health needs to be considered independently of its relationship with inflammation.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Although these in-series elastic elements-e. g. tendons in vertebrates, or apodemes in invertebrates-can neither generate force nor do work, they are thought to bring substantial benefits to musculoskeletal performance; the mechanical properties of tendons, crucial determinants of these benefits, have consequently been subject of a large body of work. In sharp contrast, scarce information exists on the mechanical properties of apodemes. The little data that do exist appear to suggest that apodemes differ so substantially from tendons that their functional significance may differ, too. To increase our understanding of apodeme function, we determined the mechanical properties of the unguitractor apodeme (UTA) of Sungaya aeta stick insects. We devised an experimental protocol that permits tensile testing with slippery and brittle apodemes; we derived and validated a mechanical model that extracts the Young's modulus from tensile tests with specimen with varying cross-sectional area, without the need for explicit measurement of the stress or strain distribution; and we interpreted the magnitude of the UTA modulus, strength and spring constant through allometric comparison with data on vertebrate tendons. The UTA modulus exceeds that of vertebrate tendons by almost one order of magnitude, but the size-corrected spring constant is nevertheless comparable and if anything smaller, due to systematic differences in apodeme and tendon shape. This many-to-one mapping suggests that apodemes may well convey the same functional benefits as tendons, and should not be prematurely excluded from invertebrate musculoskeletal models.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

TMS targeting the human primary motor cortex (M1) is well studied, aided by experimental readouts from the cerebral cortex, the spinal cord, and activated muscle targets. One key readout is a series of pulses that descend the spinal cord following TMS, called DI-waves. These reflect the output of M1 to the spinal cord and are influenced by TMS parameters such as orientation, strength, and waveform. Previous modeling studies have deployed numerous strategies to explain DI-wave generation, but generally approximate TMS inputs as semi-arbitrary current or synaptic inputs. A consistent missing piece to these models is a biophysically motivated coupling between TMS and the neural states of cells and cell populations. This study aims to leverage cable simulations of realistic neuron morphologies to couple TMS induced electric fields to average state variables of cortical cell populations. This coupling model quantifies the spatial-temporal activation function of directly stimulated axonal fibers and the average input current that downstream cells receive due to synaptic inputs from directly stimulated cells. An example M1 cortical circuit is studied, in which TMS stimulates layer 2/3 excitatory and inhibitory neurons that project synapses onto layer 5 corticospinal neurons. Results indicate that TMS induces unique directionally sensitive distributions of synaptic outputs in time and space for each cell type. Directional and dosage sensitivity carries forward to the dendritic current flowing into layer 5 cells. Ultimately, the coupling model provides a novel architecture to translate electric fields from TMS into activation functions that alter neural states and serve as inputs to cortical circuit modeling.

However, unlike communities of free-living organisms, communities of HA microbes experience selection and dispersal at two separate scales - the scale of the microbes and the scale of their hosts. Thus, HA microbes must tolerate not only the environment created by their host (microbe-scale environment), but also, the environment in which their host resides (host-scale environment). Likewise, HA microbes can disperse between hosts through either horizontal or vertical transmission (microbe-scale dispersal) but can also disperse between locations through host movement (host-scale dispersal). In this paper, we examine how multiscale environmental selection and dispersal limitation shape the genetics and HA microbiota of ants in the Aphaenogaster fulva-rudis-texana (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) complex. We begin by showing how spatial variation in Aphaenogaster genetics is shaped by host-scale environmental selection and dispersal limitation. We then show how this allows both host- and microbe-scale environmental selection to govern spatial variation in Aphaenogaster microbiota. Finally, we discuss the possibility that microbe-scale dispersal limitation also impacts spatial variation in Aphaenogaster microbiota and that this, in turn, may contribute to spatial variation in Aphaenogaster genetics. Ultimately, our results help to shed light on the myriad of interacting factors governing spatial variation in HA microbiota, including the potential for complex, bidirectional interactions between host- and microbe-scale processes.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

A promising alternative involves the incubation of locally collected invertebrates in water, followed by eDNA metabarcoding of the incubated water. In this study, we tested the suitability of two different approaches of the incubation strategy for ecological status assessment under the WFD. The first approach uses conventional multi-habitat sampling (MH) for the collection of the local macroinvertebrates and the second natural substrate exposures (NSEs) that are actively colonised. Using metabarcoding of the incubated water from both approaches (MH/NSE eDNA), we compared community composition, trait diversity and the derived ecological status classes (ESCs) to the local signal reference (MH/NSE bulk DNA) and the regional signal reference (stream water eDNA). For both approaches, community and trait composition were highly congruent between the incubated water and bulk samples. Trait composition did not differ between MH and NSE samples or among NSE types (wood-leaf vs. gravel). However, we detected small-scale spatial differences in the trait composition between NSEs placed at different flow regimes (pool vs. riffle). ESCs derived from all approaches (MH/NSE incubated water eDNA, MH/NSE bulk DNA and stream water eDNA) were highly similar and consistent with those from morpho-taxonomic assessments.

Using genetic and demographic simulations for two threatened Australian mammals, we demonstrate how this approach can enhance adaptive potential and persistence. Spatially explicit population models predict that many existing safe havens are at risk of collapse within decades.

{"title": "Embedded Ultrasonics: A Microcontroller-Based Multichannel Ultrasound Recorder for Behavioural Field Studies", "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.11.669530", "authors": "Umadi, R.", "abstract": "1. Behavioural studies investigating acoustic communication in animals--particularly echolocating bats--require transducers and recording systems that are lightweight, power-efficient, and easy to deploy. However, capturing high-frequency calls typically demands specialised, high-cost equipment and laptops, which limit portability and scalability in field settings. Advances in embedded microcontrollers and high-fidelity MEMS microphones offer an underexplored opportunity for building compact, affordable, and open-source recorders. These platforms provide design flexibility and a growing support community, but are seldom adapted for multi-channel ultrasonic recording in behavioural research. 2. To address this gap, I developed Batsy4-Pro, a 4-channel ultrasonic recorder based on the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. The system uses WM8782 ADCs to acquire synchronised 192 kHz audio streams and records them to a microSD card. The firmware is written in C++ on Arduino IDE and allows flexible configuration of recording parameters, buffering schemes, and triggering logic. The system weighs under 150 g and runs on a 5 V DC power supply, enabling untethered field deployment. 3. The system also integrates real-time heterodyne monitoring using a PCM5102A DAC, allowing users to audibly monitor bat activity during field experiments, reducing the need for additional equipment and helping field researchers decide when to initiate recordings. 4. Using a custom-built microphone array, I validated its recording fidelity using both synthetic bat call playbacks under controlled conditions and free-flying bat vocalisations in a natural foraging corridor. Recordings consistently showed high signal-to-noise ratios (>40 dB), suitable for accurate call detection and spatial localisation. 5. Batsy4-Pro offers an accessible and extensible tool for ultrasonic recording in behavioural, ecological, and neuroethological research, supporting studies where portability, ease of use, and field-readiness are essential. The open-source code and modular design facilitate community-driven development and promote the system's adoption, enabling the evolution of experimental protocols and recording paradigms, as well as the exploration of novel approaches to behavioural experiments in natural settings.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Adult humans can self-report anxiety, but assessing comparable states in animals requires objective measures. Self-directed behaviors (SDBs)--including self-scratch, autogroom, and yawn--are indicators of anxiety across species, particularly in nonhuman primates. Prevailing hypotheses suggest that social status modulates SDBs, as they offer predictability. Yet, it remains untested how broader social dynamics influence SDBs, given that they influence the quality of life of individuals. We studied 13 macaque groups across six species spanning four social styles (despotic--egalitarian). Our findings revealed partial correlational consistency among the elemental behaviors constituting composite SDB measures, highlighting their differential functions. Age and sex were associated with self-scratch and yawn. Individuals receiving more aggression self-scratched more frequently. While the most despotic species tended to exhibit least amounts of SDBs, within species' rank effects were non-linear. High-ranking individuals self-scratched less but yawned more, and alpha status was linked to increased yawning. This suggests (un)certainty in social interactions--mediated by individual rank and societal structure--influence anxiety. Thus, SDBs are not byproducts of subordination, instead reflect partially overlapping emotional responses. We provide insights into how social structure and complexity shape the evolution of emotion regulation.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Prior studies have demonstrated the added prognostic value of 3D pathology for prostate cancer risk stratification by correlating 3D microarchitectural features with long-term patient outcomes. However, these analyses relied on coarse manual annotations of cancer-enriched regions for downstream analysis without fine-grained delineation between often-intermixed cancerous and benign glands. To address these limitations, we have developed a 3D computational pipeline: Synthetic Immunolabeling for Generative Heatmaps of Tumor (SIGHT). SIGHT relies on deep learning based 3D image translation models, trained in a fully supervised fashion, to convert H&E analog 3D pathology datasets into multiplexed 3D immunofluorescence datasets that facilitate tumor detection. Our implementation of SIGHT synthetically labels two cytokeratin markers that are differentially expressed in cancerous and benign prostate glands, which are used to generate explainable 3D heatmaps of cancer-enriched regions in prostate tissues. Validation of SIGHT against ground-truth annotations from a panel of genitourinary pathologists yields an average F1 score of 0.88 which is comparable to the average inter-pathologist agreement F1 score of 0.90. To demonstrate the value of SIGHT, we developed machine classifiers of recurrence risk based on 3D glandular histomorphometric features from 75 patients. Volumetric glandular analysis in SIGHT-identified cancer-enriched regions vs. all tissue regions yields an average Kaplan-Meier hazard ratio of 3.57 (1.6 - 7.9 CI) vs. 0.92 (0.45 - 1.89 CI).", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Vicarious extinction, the process of learning by observing a parent extinguish learned threat responses, holds critical translational potential in understanding adolescent psychopathology involving aberrant threat responses. However, normative biological profiles of vicarious extinction have yet to be uncovered. Here, a community sample of 97 parent-child dyads, enriched for trauma-exposure, completed a validated vicarious extinction paradigm. Youth completed all phases during functional magnetic resonance imaging, while caregivers simultaneously completed the behavioral task. Linear models interrogating normative behavioral, physiological, and neural correlates of acquisition and direct and vicarious extinction, controlled for trauma and symptom severity. The degree of parent-child autonomic synchrony was used to predict the strength of extinction learning. Youth behavioral and skin conductance response markers suggest successful threat acquisition and direct and vicarious extinction. Autonomic arousal during active vicarious extinction learning processes was significantly associated with the strength of parent-child synchrony. Neural activation analyses reveal patterns of early encoding of threat and safety discrimination that were reactivated during later threat reinstatement. Finally, results corroborate and expand known models of direct and vicarious extinction, respectively involving the ventromedial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Altogether, this data confirms that youth can directly and vicariously modify learned threat associations with distinct neurobiological profiles. This delineation of vicarious extinction neural circuitry within a normative population is pivotal for understanding how these processes may be altered by the environment and/or psychopathology during adolescence.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

While the contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is thought to be generally responsible for processing tactile information, simultaneous responses in the ipsilateral hemisphere have been observed. This work aims to characterize the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response pattern of ipsilateral S1 to unilateral tactile stimuli. In this study, tactile stimuli were applied using a custom pneumatically actuated stimulator designed and built in house (KalantaryArdebily et al., 2024). Three stimulus force levels were applied in an event-related design. As expected we observed an apparent difference in BOLD responses between the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. We found differing response patterns between the Brodmann's areas (BA) within ipsilateral S1. Ipsilateral BA2 had a positive BOLD response similar to that of the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast, ipsilateral BA1 and BA3b appeared to have a biphasic response. That is, those regions had an initial negative response, followed by a secondary positive one. Using multi-echo analysis, we verified that this biphasic response pattern is BOLD-related. In addition, the secondary (positive) phase was more sensitive to tactile stimulus force than the initial \"negative\" BOLD phase. The ipsilateral BA1 and BA3b responses support a previous hypothesis of bilateral sensory gating (Blatow et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2014; Hamalainen et al., 2000; Kastrup et al., 2008; Klingner et al., 2016; Schafer et al., 2012; Tame et al., 2015).

Factors such as immediate needs, social bonds, hierarchical status, and reciprocity norms impact decision-making. Yet most laboratory paradigms examine individuals in isolation. We developed a face-to-face cognitive testing platform using a transparent touchscreen that allowed pairs of adult male Macaca fascicularis (n = 6) with established dominance relationships to perform a decision-making task across six social contexts: audience, co-action, envy, cooperation, competition, and altruism. We recorded eye movements simultaneously from both subjects (gaze position and pupil diameter), synchronised behavioural video, and task performance. Across social contexts, macaques performed better in the presence of a conspecific than when tested alone, but performance declined under altruistic and competitive conditions. Dominance substantially modulated motivation: dominant subjects were less willing to engage when rewards were shared (envy), when only the partner was rewarded (altruism), or when contingent action with a subordinate was required (cooperation). Eye-tracking revealed greater pre-choice arousal and social attention during social sessions, indexed by larger pupils, longer fixations on the partner's face, and more saccades before (but not during or after) choices. Pupil dilation was larger in dyads where both individuals were dominant than in dyads where one was subordinate. Finally, noninvasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) showed increased cortical engagement relative to baseline in audience, altruism, competition, and cooperation conditions.

Along these WM pathways, regions that share similar haemodynamic activity and molecular profiles are more likely to exhibit analogous atrophy patterns. By integrating the structural connectome with these multiple connectivity blueprints, we subsequently identify CUD epicenters and reveal that the prefrontal and visual cortices serve as core systems. Furthermore, we link these epicenters to cortical gene expression patterns and delineate CUD-related transcriptomic enrichment in biological processes, including inter-neuronal communication, synaptic function and neural homeostasis. Finally, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution of these epicenters correlates with cocaine craving-response maps derived from repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation and can track individual variations in clinical behavioural representations, suggesting their potential as key targets for therapeutic intervention.

Functional trait-based approaches can reveal assembly processes by linking species adaptations to community-level patterns, with convergence typically signalling strong environmental filtering and divergence reflecting niche partitioning or competitive exclusion. In extreme environments such as cold, arid mountains, it remains unclear whether persistence is driven primarily by abiotic filtering (low temperatures) or by competition for scarce resources (soil moisture, nutrients) that promotes niche differentiation. Disentangling these mechanisms requires an integrated framework combining multidimensional trait data with phylogenetic structure, enabling separation of adaptive responses from evolutionary constraints in shaping community composition. We analysed community assembly across 482 sites in six contrasting Himalayan habitats: salt marshes, wet grasslands, shrublands, steppes, screes, and alpine tundra, spanning 3,700-5,850 m. Using community-weighted means (CWM) and standardized effect sizes (SES) for 13 above- and belowground traits, including leaf morphology, stem anatomy, clonality, root carbohydrates, and nutrient storage, alongside a multi-locus phylogeny of all species, we linked functional and phylogenetic structure with species richness. Most communities showed strong functional convergence (negative SES) in stress-tolerant traits (e.g., high Leaf Dry Matter Content, Root Phosphorus Content, and Root Non-structural Carbohydrates), particularly in species-poor habitats such as salt marshes and alpine tundra. Divergence (positive SES) was more common in species-rich wet grasslands and steppes, where milder conditions likely facilitate niche differentiation. Phylogenetic overdispersion frequently accompanied functional convergence, indicating repeated evolution of similar trait syndromes in distantly related lineages under shared environmental constraints. Assembly processes had contrasting effects across traits: in alpine and scree communities, conservative traits converged while clonality and delta15N diverged, suggesting parallel action of filtering and differentiation; in nutrient-enriched systems, convergence in Specific Leaf Area coincided with divergence in root traits, highlighting trait-specific responses to stress and competition. We conclude that environmental filtering dominates Himalayan community assembly but is frequently modulated by niche differentiation. The consistent decoupling between functional and phylogenetic diversity demonstrates that only by integrating multidimensional trait data with phylogeny can we disentangle adaptation from evolutionary constraint and robustly predict biodiversity responses to environmental change.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Wild-type flies exhibited robust temperature-dependent strategies, including increased avoidance indices and U-turn frequencies at higher temperatures. Antennal thermoreceptor ablation disrupted rapid decision-making at thermal boundaries while preserving baseline heat avoidance, suggesting the presence of parallel thermosensory pathways. Flies with antennal impairments showed 9% higher active avoidance within hot zones, significant reductions in U-turn responses, increased traversal speeds, weakened centrophobism, and staccato movement patterns that remained unaffected. Supervised classifiers achieved 76.7% accuracy in distinguishing temperature conditions and 83% accuracy in identifying sensory impairments.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between transcriptomes of mFP success and failure using the criteria of logFC?1.5 and q<0.05. A NET enrichment score was computed from expression data and correlated with RFs to identify a RF signature predictive of NET enrichment. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was completed on retrieved clot tissue to provide ground truth labeling of NETs. Results: 44 DEGs were identified between mFP outcomes. From ontology analysis, NET Formation, Neutrophil Degranulation, and the NET Signaling Pathway were among the most enriched terms in the mFP failure group, with related genes downregulated in the mFP success group. 40 RFs were significantly different between mFP outcomes. Of these, 6 were found to be correlated with and predictive of clot NET enrichment. IF quantification validated that transcriptomic NET signatures accurately reflected NET presence within clot tissues. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that NET enrichment within thrombi is associated with reduced mFP success, and that radiomic features extracted from pre-thrombectomy CT imaging can serve as non-invasive biomarkers of clot NET content. This radiomic signature may aid in pre-procedural decision-making, including thrombolytic therapy planning and thrombectomy device selection.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

E.; Rice, H. C.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Previous simulations of Hebbian associative memory models inspired the malignant synaptic growth hypothesis of Alzheimers disease (AD), which suggests that cognitive impairments arise due to runaway synaptic modification resulting from poor separation between encoding and retrieval. METHODS We computationally model presynaptic inhibition by the recently identified interaction of soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) with the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR) as one potential biological mechanism which can enhance separation between encoding and retrieval. RESULTS Simulations predict that the dual effect of sAPPalpha on long-term potentiation and presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic synapses maintains effective associative memory function and prevents runaway synaptic modification. Moreover, computational modeling predicts that sAPPalpha, which interacts with the 1a isoform of GABABR, is more effective at stabilizing associative memory than the GABABR agonist Baclofen. DISCUSSION Molecular mechanisms that enhance presynaptic inhibition, such as sAPPalpha-GABABR1a signaling, are potential therapeutic targets for preventing cognitive impairments in AD.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

T cell-based immunotherapies have demonstrated remarkable success in solid tumors, yet the role of CD8+ T cells in AML remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the composition, antigenic specificity, and function of CD8+ T cells in paired blood and bone marrow samples from AML patients. While we did not identify exhausted CD8+ T cells as seen in solid tumors, we observed a distinct population of functional CD69+ CD8+ T cells specifically enriched in the bone marrow. These cells primarily recognized non-tumor antigens, including epitopes derived from Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Notably, this bystander CD8+ T cell population showed high expression of Granzyme K, a cytokine found in the bone marrow of AML patients. Granzyme K did not induce leukemic cell death but instead promoted the secretion of IL 8, a pro-inflammatory cytokine known to play a detrimental role in AML pathology. Rather than mounting an anti tumor response, these CD8+ T cells contribute to a pro-inflammatory environment that may exacerbate AML progression and severity. These findings provide a rationale for exploring therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting pro-inflammatory CD8+ T cells and targeting Granzyme K activity in association with actual therapies.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

A.; Krishnan, A.", "abstract": "Complex traits and diseases are highly polygenic and understanding the full set of genes involved is a central challenge in biomedicine. However, due to sample size limitations and noise (technical and biological), experimental approaches for disease-gene discovery such as transcriptomics and GWAS result in long, noisy, heterogeneous gene lists, which may be trimmed to a subset of likely relevant genes while leaving several false negatives. Computational gene classification approaches, especially those using genome-scale molecular interaction networks, are promising avenues for complementing such experimental findings by analytically expanding observed gene lists based on the functional relatedness between genes. We previously introduced the network-based gene classification approach, GenePlexus, which was rigorously benchmarked to show state-of-the-art performance, especially for predicting novel genes associated with biological processes and fine-grained phenotypes. Network-based gene classification performance, however, declines for diseases, especially when the inputs are omics and GWAS-based long gene lists. Here, we show that such disease gene lists span multiple biological processes spread across the molecular network and propose ModGenePlexus, a new network-based gene classification method that takes a two-stage approach. First, clustering and semi-supervised learning decomposes the input gene list into coherent denoised network gene modules. Then, ModGenePlexus trains supervised (GenePlexus) classifiers for each module and aggregates predictions to return genome-wide rankings. We benchmarked ModGenePlexus across simulated data, transcriptomic signatures, and GWAS datasets (together spanning hundreds of diseases), showing improved recovery of known disease genes compared to GenePlexus. Beyond improved classification, the results of enrichment analysis of ModGenePlexus outputs are much more interpretable by virtue of revealing nuanced biological processes. Together, these results establish ModGenePlexus as a scalable, interpretable tool for gene classification of GWAS and -omics derived genelists across diverse biological contexts.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

However, most of these alkaloids have been found in brightly colored species and there is a wide lack of knowledge of alkaloid profiles in the less colorful species. Previous finding of paralytic tetrodotoxins (TTXs) in only two cryptically colored species from the genus Colostethus, establishes the unique occurrence of hydrophilic alkaloids in the superfamily Dendrobatoidea. Unpublished results using extracts from Colostethus imbricolus, demonstrated that this species contains paralysis-producing substances, after intraperitoneal injection of mice. To analyze their skin metabolites and to determine if they correspond to TTX, or TTX analogues, we have employed a TTX-targeted separation in normal phase gradient, and an untargeted profiling in reversed-phase gradient. After performing both analyses, neither TTX nor TTX-analogues were detected in C. imbricolus. In contrast, other metabolites were separated, allowing the extraction of 76 adducts common to both analyses, being 33 of them tentatively annotated as amphibian alkaloids, eight as amphibian metabolites different from alkaloids and 25 that matched with natural products from the DNP. A total of 10 common molecular formulas remained non-annotated. The absence of MS/MS spectra for these adducts requires their structures to be confirmed in future analyses, following the completion of targeted MS/MS acquisition. After analyzing the inter-individual variation of six specimens, it was demonstrated that the skin metabolome differs between males and females of C. imbricolus. Our results lead us to conclude that TTX is not the only paralyzing compound in dendrobatid frogs and that more work should be undergone to identify this phenomenon. A notable additional outcome of this study is the first successful separation of TTX on an SB-CN column using a normal-phase gradient, enabling a novel method for TTX-targeted separation.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Recognizing the vital role of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in T cell function, we hypothesized that the strategic regulation of NFAT activity by targeting c-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNK) can bolster the tumor-eradicating potential of CAR-T cells. Methods: We developed a lentivirally encoded short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) for stable knockdown of JNK in CAR-T cells. CAR-T cells targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were produced from human peripheral blood. Functionality was tested in vitro and in two xenograft models of human ovarian cancer. Results: JNK knockdown in CAR-T cells suppressed antigen-induced stimulation and helper T cell cytokine production, while enhancing anti-tumor cytotoxicity in vitro and in ovarian cancer xenograft experiments.

Despite its growing threat, little is known about its behavioral ecology in Mediterranean coastal systems. This study presents the first acoustic telemetry-based investigation of C. sapidus within its invasive range, focusing on movement, activity, and habitat use in the Biguglia Lagoon, Corsica (Northwestern Mediterranean). In 2023, 31 adult crabs (20 males, 11 females) were tagged and monitored over four months. Activity data derived from accelerometers revealed diel patterns, with females exhibiting significantly higher walking and swimming activity, while males were more sedentary, particularly during nocturnal periods. Depth distribution also varied by sex, with females occupying shallower zones. Cumulative distance analyses indicated that females traveled farther than males, likely reflecting reproductive or exploratory behavior. Spatial analyses using Kernel Utilization Distributions (KUDs) showed that females had larger and more variable home ranges than males, with individuals extending into adjacent marine areas. Although no berried females were tagged during the study, three females were detected at sea. These observations indicate that both non-ovigerous and potentially ovigerous females are capable of undertaking early seaward migrations, for exploratory purposes or to complete reproductive maturation in marine environments. Salinity gradients played a key role in habitat selection: males favored low to intermediate salinities, while females exhibited a bimodal preference, including higher salinity zones likely associated with egg maturation and pre-spawning migrations to marine environments. These findings highlight the species behavioral plasticity and sex-specific strategies in a Mediterranean coastal environment. The integration of telemetry and environmental data provides valuable insights into the spatial ecology of C. sapidus, informing targeted management actions. This research directly contributed to Corsica first Territorial Control Plan for marine invasive species, offering a model for adaptive management in other Mediterranean regions.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

However, to date, behavioural aspects of island adaptation have comparatively received little scientific attention, especially among invertebrates. In this study we examined the agonistic, courtship and aggregation behaviour of the endangered Lord Howe Island cockroach Panesthia lata, and compared these to its Australian sister species Panesthia cribrata. Behavioural assays revealed that while courtship behaviour was relatively stable across the two species, there was a significantly lower incidence of male agonism in P. lata. In concordence, analyses of nuclear single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed that P. lata forms large aggregations of unrelated individuals, unlike most Panesthia species, which maintain stable family groups. These results align with previous findings of relaxed intraspecific aggression in island mammals and reptiles, providing novel evidence of behavioural island syndrome in an invertebrate. We also found that courtship behaviour did not vary when P. lata interacted with conspecifics from the same or different populations, suggesting that individuals from different populations will readily interbreed. This is a promising outcome for the conservation of this critically endangered species, which currently spans a fragmentary range consisting of small, insular populations.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

This includes the notable spread of antibiotic resistance genes to bacterial pathogens that increasingly threaten human health. A better understanding of the evolution of genetic elements like IncP-1 plasmids that underwrite bacterial adaptation is required to counter this threat. Here we examined the evolutionary history of IncP-1 plasmids by utilizing the large increase in published genomes and advancing techniques for lineage-based detection of microbial recombination. We specifically tested whether IncP-1 backbone genes evolve primarily (1) through vertical transmission, or (2) horizontally through homologous recombination between distinct plasmids. Our key finding is the IncP-1 plasmid backbone evolves predominantly through vertical transmission, which was supported by a nucleotide-level mapping of backbone recombination. We also showed via a phylogeny of 187 IncP-1 plasmids that established subgroup categories are well-supported. Finally, we examined factors that are potentially associated with IncP-1 subgroup diversification, including a gene related to plasmid-host adaptation and accessory genes like antibiotic and resistance metals. While some IncP-1 subgroups do correlate with certain categories of accessory genes, it remains unknown if these are causes or consequences of subgroup diversification.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Not only initiation but negative regulation of the response is critical, as autoinflammation can cause tissue damage and chronic disease. Epithelial breaches can be signaled by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including basement membrane (BM) degradation, that attract inflammatory cells. Here we show that the conserved thioester-containing protein Tep3 from Drosophila limits innate immune cell attachment to damaged and transformed epithelia. Tep3 is produced in wounds and tumors alongside the matrix metalloprotease MMP1. Tep3 inhibits MMP1 proteolytic activity, reducing production of a BM DAMP that is necessary for macrophage association. A Drosophila tumor upregulates Tep3 to limit an MMP1- and macrophage-dependent anti-tumor immune response, thus accelerating progression and host death. Hence, fly tumors can exploit a physiological anti-inflammatory axis to pathologically limit their immune restriction.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

S.; Figuerola, J.; Gangoso, L.; Vansteelant, W. M. G.", "abstract": "Wind conditions play a major role in determining how birds negotiate ecological barriers during long-distance migration. Migrants typically minimize flights over barriers in opposing winds, while crossing the same barriers directly in supportive winds. Nevertheless, even in supportive conditions, barrier-crossings likely involve a number of risk-mitigating behaviors, including the use of stepping stones. We aimed to understand how seasonal ocean-crossings of Eleonora's falcons (Falco eleonorae) compare in terms of wind support and flight effort, and whether falcons use islands to cross safely in variable wind conditions. To do this we combined GPS-tracking data from 19 individuals over a decade (2012-2022) with wind data from an atmospheric reanalysis model. Despite major differences in wind support, falcons achieved similar ground speeds in both seasons. That is because falcons reduce instantaneous flight effort by flying at lower airspeeds in supportive spring winds (31.5 {+/-} 6.0 km h-1) than in adverse autumn winds (47.4 {+/-} 9.3 km h-1). Overall, it took falcons twice as many flight hours to complete the spring crossings that were 40% greater in terms of air distance compared to autumn crossings. Islands were more frequently used during spring crossings (57.9% individuals in spring vs 21.1% in autumn), and the probability of a falcon using an island significantly increased with weaker wind support in spring (but not in autumn). While wind support partially offsets the extra distance flown over the ocean in spring, isolated islands offer emergency stop-over opportunities when Eleonora's falcons experience relatively weak wind support during protracted ocean crossings.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Key members include mammalian ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases and J-base binding proteins (JBP) from trypanosomes, which oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and thymine (T) on DNA, respectively, and are essential in gene regulation. Using sequence similarity networks and genome mining, we highlight functional predictions within the 5mYOX superfamily and identify thousands of bacteriophage-derived sequences, often found in operons encoding DNA modification machinery and binding proteins. Through high-throughput in vivo functional assays, we confirm that T oxidation occurs in bacterial viruses, establishing the presence of T dioxygenases outside of eukaryotes. We provide the first evidence for a 5mYOX subclass that is inactive unless co-expressed with a regulator protein, and through structural modeling, show that this regulator bears homology to the bacterial partition protein B (ParB). We propose a model of interaction between ParB and 5mYOX that includes complex formation, with 5mYOX binding DNA and ParB utilizing CTP, as in bacteria, to form an optimal structural configuration for productive oxidation and possibly migration on the DNA. We show these enzymes retain key catalytic residues found in TET/JBP enzymes and employ AlphaFold2-guided mutagenesis to identify clade-specific features critical for T oxidation, including a variable insertion important for ParB-independent activity and a conserved C-terminal extension essential for T oxidation in ParB-dependent homologs.

However, clinical translation of EV therapeutics has been hampered by low potency and lack of scalable production strategies. This work aims to develop a novel approach that exploits the mechanosensitivity of MSCs to enhance EV potency in the context of enhanced production via bioreactor culture. MSCs are well known to respond to mechanical stimuli such as substrate stiffness and shear stress, and here it is shown that exposing MSCs to another mechanoregulatory parameter, confinement, enhances the pro-angiogenic bioactivity of their EVs. This is consistent across both donor-derived primary MSCs and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MSCs (iMSCs). The development of a 3D-printed perfusion bioreactor system that enables culture of confined MSCs under flow is also detailed here, resulting in a 67-fold increase in EV production compared to flask culture. iMSC EVs obtained downstream of this confinement-bioreactor culture induce greater vascularization and generally improve wound healing in a diabetic mouse model compared to iMSC EVs from conventional tissue culture.

When tested on 19 ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq, snATAC-seq datasets, Chrom-Sig can effectively decompose the data into signal and noise. Notably, Chrom-Sig performs de-noising and peak calling in 1-2 hours using around 20 GB of memory. The de-noised signal corroborates with biologically meaningful results: CTCF CUT&RUN data retained a higher percentage of peaks overlapping CTCF binding motifs and ATAC-seq and RNA Polymerase II data resulted in enhancers and promoters.

While advances in machine learning and the growing availability of sequence and structure data offer promise for large-scale mutation effect prediction, viruses present unique biological and informational constraints that may challenge these models. To quantify this, we introduce EVEREST--a framework for Evolutionary Variant Effect prediction with Reliability ESTimation--which assesses model performance on viral mutational fitness prediction using a curated benchmark of 45 viral deep mutational scanning datasets (over 340 thousand variants) and quantifies model reliability in the absence of experimental data. This large-scale evaluation revealed wide differences in prediction accuracy across models and viral families. Protein language models have reach state-of-the-art performance at many mutation effect tasks, yet their effectiveness for viruses has been unclear despite their increasing deployment. We find that protein language models, trained on diverse sequence corpora, underperform on viruses compared to alignment-based models trained on much smaller sets of homologous sequences. We calibrate reliability estimates against the DMS data, and then apply this framework across 40 WHO-prioritized pandemic-threat viruses (over 400 thousand variants across 16 viral families), discovering that current models fail to reliably predict mutations in over half of these viruses.

We can experience the same stimulus completely differently depending on our prior knowledge. Understanding the neural basis of perception therefore requires measurements that capture these temporal dynamics. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approaches are widely used to characterise changes in neural representations over time. A popular example is the perceptual reorganisation paradigm, which investigates the neural correlates of enhanced recognition of distorted images after cueing with the undistorted version. Studies typically report increased representational similarity of these two images in early visual cortex. However, as these paradigms include an inherent ordering of stimuli that precludes trial randomisation or counterbalancing, they are vulnerable to temporal confounds common to fMRI. Here, we investigate how these confounds could influence current understanding of perceptual reorganisation. We tested different perceptual reorganisation paradigm designs derived from published fMRI studies, and found substantial design-driven order effects at the single-subject level for all paradigms. For certain designs, these effects artificially amplified neural indices of perceptual reorganisation at both the single-subject and group levels, emulating widespread signatures of perceptual reorganisation across the brain. To disentangle perceptual learning processes from measurement artefacts, we recommend (i) selecting designs that minimise the effect of stimulus order confounds on contrasts of interest, (ii) correcting for these confounds, and (iii) confirming results are perceptually driven via negative controls, e.g., stimuli or brain areas not expected to produce perceptual effects. Our work demonstrates how current understanding of perceptual learning mechanisms based on multivariate neuroimaging approaches could be influenced by non-obvious design confounds that misdirect interpretations towards distributed neural processing, and offers practical solutions to address this.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Although traditionally associated with mild febrile illness, the recent geographic expansion and surge in OROV outbreaks have prompted attention to its neurotropic potential. Here, we investigated the impact of OROV infection on human neural development using neural stem cells (NSCs) and brain organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Recent OROV isolates exhibiting genomic reassortment and associated with increased neurological manifestations were compared with a prototypical strain for the ability to infect NSCs, early-stage organoids, and more mature cortical-like tissues. OROV infected NSCs efficiently, leading to widespread cell death, depletion of proliferative progenitors, and disruption of neuroepithelial organization. Transcriptomic profiling of infected NSCs revealed a robust reduction of antiviral response genes and an enrichment of pathways related to viral replication, apoptosis, and the inhibition of stem cell maintenance and neuronal differentiation. These molecular signatures aligned with the phenotypic collapse of progenitor pools and cortical structure observed in organoids. OROV antigens were detected in both astrocytes and neurons, with associated structural degeneration. Although a substantial overlap in differentially expressed genes was observed between the two viral strains, some strain-specific transcriptional responses were detected. However, these modest differences did not translate into distinct cytopathogenic effects between the two viral strains. These phenotypes, including the reduced growth of infected organoids, resemble those previously described with Zika virus in the same cellular models, supporting the hypothesis that OROV may impair brain development. Together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized neuroteratogenic potential of OROV strains and provide mechanistic insight into the potential of OROV to induce microcephaly-like phenotypes, highlighting its relevance as a significant threat to maternal-fetal health.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

The etiologies of BPH are unknown, though chronic prostatic inflammation is known to promote hyperplasia, fibrotic remodeling, and therapeutic resistance in BPH. BPH is highly complex and heterogeneous, presenting with varying degrees of stromal and epithelial proliferation, fibrosis, inflammation and associated lower urinary tract symptoms. This complexity presents challenges in developing models. Here, we characterize an Aire transcription factor-deficient non-resolving (chronic) inflammation model in a C57BL/6J background for the study of the prostatic inflammation present in BPH. This chronic inflammatory model exhibits a lack of central tolerance but retains an otherwise intact and functional immune system. C57BL/6Aire-/- mice were subcutaneously injected with prostate homogenate protein and Freunds Complete Adjuvant and boosted after 10 days. After 21 and 35 days, whole prostates were collected for histology, flow cytometry, and scRNA-seq, which were then compared to human BPH scRNA-seq data Inflammation was confined to the prostate in C57BL/6Aire-/- mice. Histological and scRNA-seq data show that the dominant leukocyte phenotypes in the prostates of C57BL/6Aire-/- mice are B and T lymphocytes. Macrophages in C57BL/6Aire-/- mouse prostates express signatures associated with an array of phenotypes as also seen in BPH. We identify a Trem2+ population of macrophages, and aging-associated Cd8+ GZMK hi GZMB low T cells in C57BL/6Aire-/- prostates similar to those seen in human BPH. Further, fibroblast clusters in C57BL/6Aire-/- are similar to fibroblasts identified from the prostates of patients diagnosed with BPH, and these clusters also express markers associated with aging. Overall, the inflammation and predicted interactions between leukocytes and stromal cells observed in the prostates of C57BL/6Aire-/- mice resemble human BPH, making this model useful for studying the impact of inflammation-driven prostatic hyperplasia.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Modified sBC maintained upregulated CD155 expression and showed enhanced binding to co-receptor ligands. Co-culture studies revealed that CD155 Mut-expressing sBC suppressed CD8+ T cell and NK cell activation and proliferation by preferentially engaging the co-inhibitory receptor TIGIT.

However, the mechanisms controlling KAP1 remain poorly understood. In a recent study, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 as a direct interactor and ubiquitin ligase for KAP1. Here, we show that SMURF2-mediated ubiquitination of KAP1 at lysines K254, K319, and K779 regulates its SUMOylation activity. We further demonstrate that SMURF2 collaborates with the deubiquitinase USP7/HAUSP, recruiting it to KAP1, to regulate a dynamic ubiquitination-deubiquitination cycle at these key residues. Cells expressing a KAP1 mutant, resistant to SMURF2-USP7 regulation, exhibit profound alterations in chromatin structure, gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and elevated LINE-1 retrotransposon activity. Notably, disrupting the SMURF2-USP7-KAP1-SUMOylation axis in cancer cells reduces their malignancy and tumor growth in vivo.

In particular, drone-borne topobathymetric LiDAR provides high-resolution (cm-scale), three-dimensional information about the geometry and structure of surveyed areas, allowing for quantification of vegetation volume in addition to bathymetry. For habitat-forming submerged and intertidal vegetation like seagrass, this information can advance research regarding the structure and patchiness of canopies in relation to biodiversity, blue carbon storage, and hydrodynamic processes. Here, we report how drone-borne LiDAR can be used to estimate the habitat volume of eelgrass (Zostera marina) within a sheltered bay in south-eastern Norway. After classifying LiDAR points using a Random Forest model, we created a Digital Terrain Model of the sea floor and a Digital Surface Model of the eelgrass canopy. From these models, we estimated eelgrass canopy volume to range between 862 and 1099 m3 across the small study area. From the volume, we estimated above-ground carbon storage in living eelgrass tissue to range between 96 and 122 kg. To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilise drone-borne LiDAR to quantify the volume and carbon-storage potential of a marine habitat-forming species like eelgrass, thereby demonstrating the potential of drone-borne LiDAR as an efficient tool to provide reproducible and high-resolution data for submerged aquatic habitats, including seagrass meadows.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

J.; Rosindell, J.", "abstract": "In the face of rapid biodiversity loss, many approaches have been developed to measure biodiversity in ways that go beyond species richness. One prominent example is Phylogenetic Diversity (PD), which, on a dated phylogenetic tree, measures evolutionary history by summing the branch lengths measured in time required to connect a set of species. PD may also capture other biodiversity measures by proxy such as the richness of biological features and their potential benefits for humanity, known as future options. The total global PD is known for some well-studied groups, such as most vertebrates, but PD estimates are lacking for the majority of the tree of life. Here, we characterize the distribution of PD across the complete tree of life with over 2.2 million species. To do this we use data from the Open Tree of Life and a smoothing method to interpolate between nodes without date information. We estimate that the PD represented by all described species together is between 30 and 33 trillion years (95% confidence interval). We characterize the distribution of evolutionary distinctiveness, a measure of the fair share of PD captured by individual species, across all life and within selected clades. This Evolutionary Distinctiveness metric has previously been used as the basis for conservation prioritization schemes such as EDGE (Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered) which synthesizes phylogenetic tree data with extinction risk data from the IUCN Red List of threatened species. We use our results to estimate EDGE scores for over 130,000 species. We also estimate the amount of threatened phylogenetic diversity across the complete tree of life.

We used whole-genome sequencing of the warbler genus Myioborus to investigate dynamics of its recent diversification in Neotropical mountains. We found that mitochondrial and UCE phylogenies are mostly, but not fully, concordant, and we found phylogenetic support for a pattern of north-to-south and low-to-high elevation colonization in the genus. Within the ornatus-melanocephalus complex, which showed topological incongruence between our phylogenies, we found that genetic structure generally coincides with geographic variation in plumage, although three subspecies with striking plumage differences exhibit low mitochondrial divergence. The hybridizing taxa M. o. chrysops and M. m. bairdi show very shallow genomic differentiation, with marked peaks of divergence. Most of these are shared with other parulid warbler pairs, pointing to broad genomic features, like recombination rate, as the processes shaping these regions. However, other highly differentiated regions were unique to Myioborus, including one containing the gene CCDC91, which is associated with melanin-based plumage differences in several other birds. Lastly, we found higher levels of differentiation on the Z chromosome relative to autosomes, including two putative chromosomal inversions.

The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster has eight insulin-like peptides, which are differentially expressed across development time, organs, and with nutritional conditions. However, whether individual insulin-like peptides play specific roles in controlling growth remains unknown. Recent studies have revealed that the ratio of protein to carbohydrates in the diet plays a key role in regulating life history traits, rather than the total caloric content of the diet alone. Furthermore, individual insulin-like peptides vary in their expression profiles according to nutrient conditions. Whether these differences in expression have any functional significance to animal life history traits remains unclear. Here we report that reducing the protein content of the larval diet through macronutrient restriction where the calories lost from protein dilution are offset by increased carbohydrate content results in a more pronounced developmental delay compared to caloric restriction where both protein and carbohydrate concentrations are reduced. We further reveal that these two diet types result in notable differences in the expression levels of Drosophila insulin-like peptides 2, 3 and 5, and observe distinct phenotypic responses of individual insulin-like peptide mutants raised on each diet type. Taken together, our findings highlight the distinct roles of individual insulin-like peptides in regulating growth and development time in response to changes in dietary macronutrients, and provide key insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling nutritional plasticity in Drosophila.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

To capture the metabolic changes that underlie its adaptation to both nutrient-rich and xylem-like environments, we performed transcriptome analyses on two reference strains, Temecula1 and 9a5c, sampled at early and late exponential phases in a complex laboratory medium (PWG) and a defined, xylem-mimicking medium (PIM6). Across eight conditions (24 transcriptomes), over 90% of annotated coding sequences were expressed, although 40-80% of transcripts exhibited low abundance (TPM < 100). In contrast, a core set of highly abundant transcripts was seen in both strains and media, including the non-coding RNAs 6S and RNase P, as well as multiple colicin- and microcin-like toxins, proteases, lipases, and stress-response factors. Comprehensive pathway reconstruction confirmed the activity of all essential metabolic pathways, while revealing conditional enrichment of stress-related and defense modules under nutrient limitation. We annotated 5' and 3' untranslated regions for thousands of transcripts and defined over 900 operons across both genomes. Differential expression analysis demonstrated that PIM6 medium confers a far greater transcriptional reprogramming between early and late phases than PWG. Strain-to-strain comparisons revealed that up to 12.6% of orthologous genes were differentially regulated, emphasizing divergent regulatory networks even under identical growth conditions. This multi-dimensional transcriptome atlas not only refines X. fastidiosa genome annotation but also pinpoints candidate regulators, non-coding RNAs, and operon variants for functional validation.

We generated genome assemblies for ten brood parasitic species plus eight species representatives of their parental/nesting outgroups.

Leveraging this new catalog of avian genomes, we constructed clade-level alignments that reveal variation in chromosomal synteny, provide first-time or improved annotations of protein- coding and non-coding genes, and define cross-species ortholog reference sets. We also refine estimates for the timing of the seven independent origins of brood parasitism, ranging from recent events such as 1.6 to 4.5 million years ago in Molothrus cowbirds to much earlier origins over 30 million years ago in two of the three cuckoo lineages.

Haploid males develop from unfertilized eggs and diploid females from fertilized eggs. Many species also have single locus complementary sex determination (sl-CSD): hemizygosity of a CSD gene results in normal males and heterozygosity in normal females, but homozygosity typically yields sterile diploid males. Populations that lose CSD allelic diversity to critical level, increasingly produce detrimental diploid males. Emblematic of this problem are the bumblebees. Bumblebees are one of the fastest declining animal groups worldwide, with CSD diversity loss playing a likely role, especially in isolated populations. Presently utilized and potential future species in agriculture are also challenged by diploid males in production. Population management of both requires exact knowledge of the CSD locus. Here we report the identity of Bombus terrestris CSD, a bumblebee model that is also a major commercial pollinator. As CSD must be reciprocally homozygous in diploid males and heterozygous in diploid females, we whole-genome-sequenced these for four colonies. From this, we identified B. terrestris CSD (BtCSD) on Chromosome 2: a 26 Kb region with a long non-coding RNA region (lncRNA) and a proximate hypervariable region. Comparative analyses indicated conservation of this region across infraorder Aculeata, including other bumblebees, mason bees, and ants. This supports a deep-rooted ancestral origin for BtCSD despite a lack of homology with con-familial honey bee csd and rapid evolutionary divergence of insect sex determination cascades. Our analyses do not support the lncRNA region as functional CSD, as proposed for other taxa, because of inadequate variation to constitute distinct alleles. Rather, a downstream region is implicated for its massive structural variation and candidate coding genes including Creld and two copies of aCOP. We discuss how this identification of BtCSD has critical implications for hymenopteran evolution and bumblebee population management.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Previously, we developed a methodology for designing theoretical TMS coils to achieve optimal trade-off between the depth and focality of the induced E-field, as well as the energy required by the coil. This paper presents methods for the practical design and implementation of such focal-deep TMS (fdTMS) coils. First, we consider how the coil's shape affects energy requirements and design a curved hat former that enables a wide range of coil placements while improving energy efficiency compared to flat formers. Second, we introduce a hybrid layer winding implementation to improve energy efficiency by using multi-layer windings in some regions of the coil and a single layer in others. Using simulations with a spherical head model, we benchmark the focality of the fdTMS E-field in the brain and the scalp, as well as the required energy, against conventional TMS coils. We then implement two fdTMS coil designs using copper wire wound inside a 3d-printed plastic former. The E-field of the prototype fdTMS coils and two conventional figure-8 counterparts is measured with a robotic probe to validate the designs. The experimental measurements corroborate the simulations, demonstrating that the fdTMS coils produce a more compact E-field relative to standard figure-8 coils. One potential disadvantage of the fdTMS coil prototypes is wider spread of the scalp E-field and increased energy loss due to the additional windings. Nonetheless, the presented fdTMS coils could offer advantages for precise mapping studies, and the design framework could be leveraged for other coil optimizations.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Applied to GTEx v8 data, we show the method readily recapitulates canonical endocrine relationships, including insulin and adiponectin signaling, while inferring new candidate organokines and their signaling modality. We also explore its utility for generating new hypotheses on cardiokine candidates and finding distal factors that may affect cardiac protein synthesis and metabolism. The predictions suggest a potential role of circulating galectin-3 (LGALS3) in regulating cardiac protein synthesis and homeostasis, which can be recapitulated in part in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes.

Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques, on the other hand, provide single-cell resolution but lose spatial resolution because of the tissue dissociation step. With these complementary strengths in mind, computational tools have been developed to combine scRNA-seq and ST data. These approaches use deconvolution to identify cell types and their reoctive proportions present at each location in ST data, with the aid of a scRNA-seq reference dataset. It has been suggested that deconvolution methods are sensitive to the absence of cell types in the scRNA-seq reference, a problem referred to as cell type mismatch. Here, we used extensive simulations to systematically evaluate the robustness to cell type mismatch of six state-of-the-art deconvolution methods tailored for spatially resolved transcriptomics data, along with two deconvolution methods designed for bulk RNA-seq data. At baseline, that is, with no cell types missing from the reference data, cell2location, RCTD, and CARD were the best performing methods, while SPOTlight performed worst. By simulating various cell type mismatch scenarios, we found that the performance of deconvolution methods decreases proportionally to the number of cell types missing from the reference data. Moreover, for most deconvolution methods the decrease in performance is similar relative to their baseline performance. We also observed that those methods that perform well at baseline tend to assign the proportions of a missing cell type to the transcriptionally most similar cell types present in the reference data. This study highlights the adverse effects of cell type mismatch on the performance of deconvolution methods for ST data and stresses the need for methods that are more robust to this type of mismatch.

Here, we show that GIPR agonism abrogatesthe aversive and enhances the anorexigenic effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}). Aversion-encoding parabrachial calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) neurons were required for IL-1{beta}-induced conditioned taste avoidance (CTA) but not anorexia. Moreover, systemic IL-1{beta} increased in vivo CGRP neural activity, and this was significantly attenuated by co-administration of a GIPR agonist. By contrast, GIPR in the dorsal vagal complex were required for the acute anorectic effect of GIPR agonism but not its anti-aversive effect.

Current therapies for these diseases focus on blocking IFN-I signaling at different levels, but with incomplete success. Throughout evolution, to counteract the host immune response, poxviruses have developed decoy receptors, soluble proteins secreted from infected cells during infection that bind and block key host cytokines. One of these, the poxvirus IFN-I binding protein (IFN{beta}BP) is a unique soluble receptor with the ability to block many IFN-I subtypes with broad species specificity. In addition, this protein interacts with glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface while binding IFN-I, which enhances its immunomodulatory potential by allowing the retention of this receptor around the site of infection. In this study, we have deepened into how the poxvirus IFN{beta}BP modulates IFN-I to apply this knowledge to the development of new anti-IFN-I therapeutics. With this purpose, a set of IFN{beta}BP-based recombinant proteins were generated and tested for their ability to neutralize IFN-I and bind to the cell surface in vitro, and their immunomodulatory action was tested in the mousepox model of pathogenesis.

L.; Heinz, S.", "abstract": "Background: Atherosclerotic lesions comprise different populations of macrophages, including lipid-laden macrophage foam cells and non-foamy, inflammatory macrophages, playing different roles in disease progression. Previous studies demonstrated higher expression of inflammarafts - enlarged, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts hosting assemblies of inflammatory receptors - in non-foamy, inflammatory macrophages, as opposed to lower inflammarafts in lipid-lade macrophage foam cells. Apolipoprotein A-I Binding Protein (AIBP) facilitates cholesterol efflux from macrophages and has been shown to reduce inflammatory responses and protect against atherosclerosis. This study investigated the effect of AIBP deficiency on inflammaraft expression in aortic foam cells and non-foamy macrophages in hypercholesterolemic mice. Methods: Single-cell suspensions were prepared from aortae of Apoa1bp-/-Ldlr-/- and Ldlr-/- male and female mice fed a high-cholesterol, high-fat diet. CD45+ F4/80+ macrophages were gated for BODIPY-high foamy and BODIPY-low non-foamy cells and analyzed for the expression of inflammaraft markers TLR4 (toll-like receptor-4) dimers and lipid rafts. Consecutive sections of the aortic root were stained with modified Van Gieson stain to assess lesion and necrotic core sizes. Results: Foam cells constituted a higher percentage of macrophages and contained more neutral lipid in Apoa1bp-/-Ldlr-/- compared to Ldlr-/- aorta. Importantly, in AIBP-deficient mice, foam cells expressed higher levels of TLR4 dimers and lipid rafts than in control mice, while non-foamy cells expressed similar levels. Apoa1bp-/-Ldlr-/- mice had larger atherosclerotic lesions and necrotic cores compared to Ldlr-/- mice. Male and female mice showed similar results. Conclusions: Our results indicate that AIBP deficiency leads to the formation of a new foam cell phenotype in which the increased lipid accumulation is associated with an increased expression of TLR4 inflammarafts. This transition of foam cells to a proinflammatory phenotype correlates with the development of advanced atherosclerotic plaques.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Here we report that HIV-1, by virtue of its pathogenesis factor Nef, impairs activation and transcriptionally reprograms CD4 T cells to dampen Th1 differentiation in response to antigen-specific stimulation by DCs. These alterations also disrupt functional communication to DCs to reduce DC activation and limit Th1 helper cytokine production. Mechanistically, Nef achieves this modulation of antigen-specific CD4 T cell function by reducing T cell surface levels of CD4.

However, developmental robustness and canalization buffer these fluctuations to maintain normal development. Nevertheless, understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern this robustness is challenging because of the complex interactions between these factors. In Drosophila, the number of scutellar sensory organs (SSO; macrochaetes) derived from the sensory organ precursors (SOPs) in the larval wing disc has been used as a model to study developmental robustness. Although the number of SOPs is strictly regulated by a network of signaling and transcription factors in the imaginal disc, non-intrinsic broader factors such as temperature and energy metabolism additionally influence SSO-number fluctuation. Moreover, the precise molecular mechanisms regulating the systemic control of bristle number remain unknown. In this study, we identify factors controlling bristle robustness by performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We observed significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Maltase gene cluster and found that the knockdown of Maltase genes affected SSO numbers. Furthermore, Maltase-A1(Mal-A1) in the gut regulated insulin signaling systemically, thereby affecting SSO-number fluctuation. These results suggest that Mal-A1 contributes to robustness by modulating glucose availability and Drosophila insulin-like peptide 3 (dilp3) level, which affects the SOPs in a nonautonomous manner.

The micromammal species richness in the area exhibited a strong correlation with the capture methodology employed. Regarding the estimation of abundance, the densities of micromammals determined by STE were found to be within the range of the estimations of minimum population size determined by CRM. The STE, which was found to be promising, also allowed the determination of the abundance of other small-sized terrestrial wildlife, such as reptiles. Our findings indicate its potential for camera trap multi-species monitoring.

We used simulations to measure how kernels affect diversity across metacommunity scales and ecological contexts. We disentangled causes of these patterns using a novel approach quantifying the effects of environmental filtering, competition, stochasticity, and dispersal on fitness. Although metacommunities with shallow kernels followed expectations where emigration increased alpha- but decreased beta- and gamma-diversity, metacommunities with steeper kernels did not. Steeper kernels maintained regional diversity by reducing interspecific competition and stochastic extinctions, with dispersal conferring weaker benefits but less homogenization.

V.; Coughlan, J. M.", "abstract": "Understanding evolutionary repeatability is a central question in biology, as it informs how predictably organisms respond to similar selection pressures. However, the extent to which phenotypic repeatability is recapitulated at the genetic level remains unclear, particularly for quantitative traits. The recurrent evolution of similar phenotypes in high altitude plant populations relative to their low altitude counterparts offers an ideal model for testing genetic repeatability, as these habitats are associated with shifts in complex suites of phenotypes. Here, we investigate the modularity and genetic architecture of life-history trait divergence across four independent transitions to high altitude habitats among closely related perennial taxa in the Mimulus guttatus species complex. High altitude taxa exhibit largely repeated phenotypic evolution in 40 univariate traits and suites of traits form correlated modules that are highly similar across taxa. Nonetheless, the genetic architecture underlying each trait was largely non-repeatable, a pattern consistent for both quantitative and genetically simple traits. Despite a general lack of overall repeatability, individual QTLs with larger effects and those that were associated with multiple traits were more likely to be repeatable than smaller-effect or single-trait associated loci. These findings suggest that evolution may follow distinct genetic pathways while repeatedly converging on functionally integrated trait modules. Additionally, although there may be several genetic routes to the same phenotypic outcomes, aspects of genetic architecture can influence the most likely genetic routes taken.

We found that ZIPK phosphorylates MRLC sequentially, first at Ser19 and then at Thr18, determined by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis on wild-type MRLC. Analysis on phosphomimic and unphosphorylatable MRLC mutants indicates that the phosphorylation rate at Ser19 on unphosphorylated MRLC is 1.5 times faster than that at Thr18 on Ser19-phosphorylated MRLC. Comparison between SMM and isolated MRLC revealed that the phosphorylation rate of SMM is slower than that of isolated MRLC. To dissect the molecular mechanism responsible for this difference, we measured interactions between ZIPK and SMM by co-sedimentation assay. The result suggests that the C-terminal domain of ZIPK interacts with the heavy chain of SMM, and as a result, competitive binding of ZIPK to MRLC and the myosin heavy chain suppresses phosphorylation of SMM compared to isolated MRLC. By incorporating the kinetic and dissociation constants obtained from mutant analysis and co-sedimentation assays, respectively, a simple kinetic model accurately reproduced the time courses of phosphorylation for both isolated MRLC and SMM.

Currently available anti-coagulant drugs render blood thinner irrespective of whether an inflammatory pro-thrombotic condition exists or whether clotting needs to occur because of traumatic vessel rupture. It is desirable to develop a drug that is active only under the oxidizing conditions present during inflammation. The blood protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) plays a key role in initiating blood clotting and it has been the target of anti-thrombotic therapies. It has been shown that oxidizing agents released during inflammation activate VWF by converting methionine residues within its domains to methionine sulfoxide. A previous study by us developed a method to computationally screen for drugs that inhibit VWF more strongly in the presence of oxidizing conditions. The computations suggested in particular a drug, lumacaftor, that could inhibit VWF function selectively in the presence of oxidized methionine residues. Here, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test the effect of drugs on the ability of VWF to bind to the platelet surface receptor glycoprotein Ib comparing oxidizing and non-oxidizing conditions. The results indicate that lumacaftor may indeed have the desired properties of inhibiting VWF selectively when oxidized.

R. B.; Winter, J. M.", "abstract": "Background: The rapid increase in publicly available microbial and metagenomic data has created a growing demand for tools that can efficiently perform custom large-scale comparative searches and functional annotation. While BLAST+ remains the standard for sequence similarity searches, population-level studies often require custom scripting and manual curation of results, which can present barriers for many researchers. Results: We developed SeqForge, a scalable, modular command-line toolkit that streamlines alignment-based searches and motif mining across large genomic datasets. SeqForge automates BLAST+ database creation and querying, integrates amino acid motif discovery, enables sequence and contig extraction, and curates results into structured, easily parsed formats. The platform supports diverse input formats, parallelized execution for high-performance computing environments, and built-in visualization tools. Benchmarking demonstrates that SeqForge achieves near-linear runtime scaling for computationally intensive modules while maintaining modest memory usage. Conclusions: SeqForge lowers the computational barrier for large-scale meta/genomic exploration, enabling researchers to perform population-scale BLAST searches, motif detection, and sequence curation without custom scripting. The toolkit is freely available and platform-independent, making it suitable for both personal workstations and high-performance computing environments.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

However, existing models still face challenges, including potential inaccuracies in thermodynamic feature calculations (such as incorrect strand selection for siRNA-mRNA Gibbs free energy), limited effective utilization of available datasets, and a lack of systematic model refinement. In this study, I systematically evaluated the predictive power of individual features and neural network architectures to identify the most effective configurations. This process led to the development of RN.Ai-Predict, a model built upon a tokenized learned embedding for nucleotide sequences. This work demonstrates that a methodical approach to feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, particularly favoring learned embeddings, can yield a more accurate and reliable model for predicting siRNA efficacy, outperforming more complex architectures in generalizability.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Loss of lamina function and perturbations in energy production are associated with pronounced aberrations in cellular morphology, particularly within nuclear architecture and the plasma membrane. Systematic analysis of nuclear morphology can reveal conserved structures across diverse cancer types, enabling disease state stratification, biomarker discovery, and potential avenues for personalizing therapy to minimize recurrence risk. To this end, this study analyzes an imaging mass cytometry (IMC) breast cancer dataset, differentiating cancerous and non-cancerous nuclei with a p-value of 1.02e-06. In addition, this study achieves an accuracy of 78 percent and a f1 score of 72 percent using a computational and machine learning-based pipeline for analyzing the morphological heterogeneity of nuclei and protein expression, enabling characterization of patient-specific tumor phenotypes. Unlike traditional morphology analysis pipelines limited to specific imaging platforms, this workflow enables cross-cohort and cross-cancer comparison, capturing tumor-specific phenotypic deviations at a single-cell resolution.

The ability to monitor vascular degeneration as AD progresses is essential. Three-photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM) enables high-resolution deep tissue imaging with minimal invasiveness and photodamage. Aim: This study established a longitudinal 3P imaging pipeline to quantify vascular degeneration and amyloid plaque formation in the APP NL-G-F mouse model. Approach: A cranial window allowed repeated 3P imaging at four-week intervals beginning at five weeks after surgery. Vessels labelled with Texas-Red were segmented using DeepVess, while plaques labelled with methoxy-XO4 were segmented using custom scripts. Quantitative analyses assessed vascular parameters (diameter, density, tortuosity, length, inter-vessel distance) and plaque metrics (radius, nearest plaque-to-vessel distance). Results: We imaged the same field over 4 weeks quantifying a decrease in vasculature and increase in amyloid plaque formation with age. Significant decreases in vessel diameter, increases in inter-vessel distance, and alterations in vessel length were observed. Changes in vessel tortuosity, plaque radius, and plaque proximity to vessels were not significant. Conclusions: This pipeline tracks vascular remodeling and amyloid pathology in deep cortical structures. It offers a tool for studying the interplay between vascular and amyloid pathologies in AD, supporting future research into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

We analyzed quantitative measurements of peptide seroreactivity to identify epitopes driving viral serotype-level exposure signatures, as well as novel mosquito sialome antigens. Mosquito-directed antibody responses were associated with natural viral exposure, but highly heterogeneous at an individual level.

Once clinical signs are observed in elephants, the disease progresses rapidly and frequently results in death. EEHV-HD negatively impacts elephant conservation because very young, reproductively immature elephants are most at risk for death. Ongoing efforts to understand disease pathogenesis and progression may identify treatment targets and improve clinical outcomes. In some lethal EEHV-HD cases, microthrombosis has been observed in organ tissues similar to other hemorrhagic diseases in humans and animals where sticky webs of protein-coated DNA strands called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) exacerbate thrombosis and hemorrhage associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In this study, we sought to identify if NET formation occurs in elephants and could contribute to poor outcomes in EEHV-HD. Our study demonstrated NET release for the first time from elephant heterophils (neutrophils) that occurred in response to various stimuli, including plasma from EEHV-HD affected elephants. EEHV-HD affected tissues contained extensive NETs suggesting that dysregulated NET formation contributes to pathogenesis of this disease. Importantly, elephant neutrophils were blocked from releasing NETs in response to EEHV-HD plasma using known NET inhibitors. The ability to stop NETs in EEHV-HD offers a new therapeutic approach that could be combined with current therapies to improve survival for affected elephants and to positively impact conservation efforts.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

In this study, we sequenced the complete genomes of eighteen viruses infecting the cosmopolitan unicellular green alga Ostreococcus tauri (OtVs) and one specific to Micromonas commoda (McV-20T). Of these viruses, twelve were previously isolated from the coastal Mediterranean Sea and seven were newly isolated from two different geographical locations (i.e., the South Pacific Gyre and the North Sea). Phylogenetic analysis classified these viruses as new members of the Prasinovirus genus and defined three distinct OtV clades: designated OtV-type 1, OtV-type 2a and OtV-type 2b. The OtV-type 1 includes three new viruses isolated from the Pacific Ocean and the previously sequenced genome OtV6. The OtV-type 1 form a large cluster within the Micromonas-infecting virus clade, sharing five unique homologous genes with all Micromonas viruses. In addition, genetic features of OtV-type 1, including a higher number of CDSs ({approx}260) and lower GC content ({approx}41%), were more closely allied to Micromonas viruses than to those of OtVs, suggesting an alternative host or a recent host switch from Micromonas to O. tauri. By analyzing the OtV genomes, we found a faster-evolving central hypervariable region (HVR), where the OtV-type 2b displayed the largest region, i.e., three times longer than other OtVs. This region encodes genes mainly associated with host cell recognition and attachment and under strong selective pressure (positive and negative). Notably, most viruses associated with OtV-type 2b showed the broadest host range. Infection dynamics between the hosts and the viruses appeared highly specific to host-virus pairs, suggesting complex interactions in the Ostreococcus-prasinovirus system. Finally, by observing viral lysates with electron microscopy, we observed novel morphologies never described for these viruses. Overall, this study provides new insights into the genetic diversity of prasinoviruses and describes for the first time a viral plasticity that might be strongly shaped by antagonistic coevolution with their hosts.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

These epivariable regions, which make up a small fraction of the genome, are strongly influenced by genetic factors and environmental factors, especially during early development. In this context, epigenetic variability of DNA methylation has been proposed as an adaptive force involved in various environmental responses. In fish and other vertebrates, environmental factors are known to influence the health, performance and welfare, likely through the alteration of the epigenetic landscape. However, whether interindividual epigenetic variability may contribute to the phenotypic plasticity of fishes is unknown. Here we provide a first description of the rainbow trout methylome variability using a whole-genome bisulfite sequencing approach in an isogenic line to minimize genetic variation. Variable methylation regions were identified in both liver and hypothalamus tissues of 12 replicate fishes and were found enriched at gene regulatory elements, such as promoters and first introns. Gene Ontology analysis revealed functional clusters related to cellular development, neural communication, metabolic balance, and immune response. Interestingly, some variably methylated regions are found at the same genomic loci in both tissues and showed a strong intraindividual correlation in methylation levels, suggesting establishment during early embryogenesis. Overall, our work demonstrates the existence of interindividual epigenetic variability in rainbow trout and provides valuable insights into the regulatory function of DNA methylation variation that is likely involved in developmental and physiological processes.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

This study examined genotypic variation in TE and its physiological determinants across diverse wheat lines. An initial experiment with six cultivars was expanded to 105 genetically-diverse genotypes evaluated under well-watered conditions and fluctuating vapour pressure deficit (VPD). Using a high-throughput lysimeter platform, transpiration rates were recorded every 10 minutes and normalised daily at low VPD to account for genotypic variations in canopy size. TE was strongly associated with reduced normalised transpiration rate at high VPD (TRnorm-highVPD), while no significant relationship was found with maximum photosynthetic capacity. High-TE lines achieved either greater biomass with similar water use or similar biomass with lower water use, reflecting a water-saving strategy under high evaporative demand. A complementary experiment under low VPD revealed limited genotypic variation in intrinsic TE, reinforcing the value of TRnorm-highVPD as a screening trait. Consistent correlations between TE and TRnorm-highVPD across experiments highlight the potential of TRnorm-highVPD as a robust phenotyping target. Several high-TE lines outperformed modern cultivars, offering promising sources of novel alleles.

Semaglutide also drives graded increases of the essential secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in Glp1r-expressing AP neurons (APGlp1r) through Gs-dependent and -independent manners. Inhibition of the cAMP-degradation enzyme phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) can enhance and sustain these cAMP responses, whereas disruption of Gs or cAMP signaling in APGlp1r neurons abolishes semaglutide-induced weight loss and downstream brain-wide activation.

However, dysregulation of IL-22 and/or IL-17 contributes to autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, and malignancy. Thus, a deeper understanding of mechanisms regulating type III cytokine production could provide new therapeutic targets for a spectrum of immune-mediated diseases. Toward this goal, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screen to identify factors that regulate IL-22/IL-17 expression in a murine type III innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) model, MNK3, following stimulation with IL-23 and IL-1b. In addition to previously known regulators of type III cytokines, including IL-23 receptor components IL23R and IL12RB1, the screen identified a large set of new factors that either potentiate or attenuate expression of IL-22 and/or IL-17. A subset of these novel factors was chosen for validation, from which two were selected for further study. The nuclear protein, SON, which binds both DNA and RNA, impaired expression of IL12RB1 at the levels of de novo transcription and RNA processing. The second, MAP4K1 (HPK1), is a serine/threonine kinase that is required for IL-22 but not IL-17 expression. Depletion of MAP4K1 in MNK3 also enhanced expression of the type I cytokine, IFNg, which was co-expressed with IL-17, a phenotype reminiscent of pathogenic Th17 cells.

In enteric species, the OM is covered by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) decorated with varying lengths of O-antigen (O-Ag) polysaccharide that protect bacteria against mammalian host defenses. Studies of lab-adapted Escherichia coli K-12 strains have proven instrumental in unravelling the essential processes of LPS synthesis, transport, and assembly into the OM. However, O-Ag synthesis was inactivated in K-12 strains during their lab adaption, and these cells produce a non-native, truncated LPS form. Surprisingly, we found that re-activating O-Ag synthesis in K-12 permeabilizes the OM to diverse antibiotics, causing susceptibility. The O-Ag that modifies LPS is directly responsible for the compromised OM barrier. Lengthening the O-Ag polysaccharide worsens antibiotic sensitivity; while shortening it, or removing it entirely, improves antibiotic resistance in both E. coli and the human pathogen, Shigella flexneri. Our data show that OM antibiotic barrier integrity is maintaining by a balanced production of long and short LPS forms, and that this balance is dysfunctional in model E. coli K-12 strains. Our findings reveal that long O-Ag polysaccharides are a double-edged sword: while well-recognized as critical for protection against external host assaults, their transport and assembly onto the surface comes at the inherent price of compromising the OM barrier. Hence, LPS production balances between competing needs in host defense and OM integrity. Moreover, we identify an inherent advantage for species that produce O-Ag-lacking lipooligosaccharide (LOS), rather than LPS.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Importantly, many RNA-based omics approaches typically involve either the removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or selection of messenger RNA (mRNA) prior to sequencing, thereby enriching reads that map to the translationally active part of the transcriptome. Prokaryotic mRNA differs from eukaryotic mRNA in that it lacks the 3' polyadenylated tail, which excludes the use of poly(A)-based selection methods. While commercial rRNA depletion products exist for a growing number of prokaryotes, their proprietary nature and potential inefficiency with non-model organisms are factors that may limit broad-scale application. To mitigate this issue, we designed DepStep, a consolidated workflow for one-step rRNA depletion using species-specific biotinylated antisense probes for selective hybridization and removal of the target rRNA molecules. As a proof-of-concept, RNA-seq libraries of the psychrophilic gram-negative bacterium Shewanella glacialimarina TZS-4T were prepared using both DepStep and a commercial rRNA depletion kit for gram-negative bacteria, to which DepStep was benchmarked. DepStep compares favorably to the commercial depletion kit; it efficiently removes >98.6% of the rRNA content, and a slight increase in total read counts aligning to the coding sequences (CDS) was observed. Importantly, DepStep's cost-per-sample is three times lower than the commercial kit, establishing DepStep as a simple yet cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Z.; Childers, M. C.; Fruebis, K. J.; Soriano, R.; Davis, J.; Regnier, M.", "abstract": "The binding of myosin to actin to form crossbridges is a critical step for force generation by sarcomeres. A recent cryo-electron microscopy structure has resolved the weakly-bound actomyosin complex (AM.ADP.Pi); however, the structural and dynamic factors that influence actin-myosin association are unclear. The disordered loop 2 of myosin is thought to mediate actomyosin interactions in complex, chemomechanical state-dependent fashion; however, the loop is usually unresolved in structural studies due to its intrinsic disorder. Here, we utilize a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electrostatic calculations to investigate the dynamics of these actin binding regions of myosin. Our results show that loop 2 experiences disordered dynamics and that specific conformations sampled by loop 2 modulate the strength of the associative electrostatic force between actin and myosin. Variation in the actin-myosin associative force was associated with the presentation and orientation of positively charged residues in loop 2. We provide an in-depth analysis of the conformational state space occupied by loop 2 during nine 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations of pre-powerstroke human {beta}-myosin S1, with three replicates each of wildtype and two different mutant (E525K and V606M) myosin structures. This dataset allowed for exploration of how loop 2 conformational sampling is altered by these two mutations which have been clinically and experimentally associated with cardiomyopathy and altered actin binding affinity. The E525K and V606M mutations altered the conformational ensemble sampled by loop 2 and were associated with associative actin binding strength. These results highlight the importance of the positive charges on loop 2 for actomyosin interactions and demonstrate how disease-causing mutations outside of loop 2 can still affect it.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

From euphotic zone depth-resolved samples analyzed by for DNA and acid vacuole staining (Hoechst and LysoTracker Green) by ship-board flow cytometry, we found that autotrophic populations were dominated by Prochlorococcus, followed by mixotrophs (58 and 28% of autotrophic community biomass, respectively), with only 14% obligate phototrophic phytoplankton (i.e., plastidic cells without acid vacuole fluorescence). Acid vacuole-containing microbes (mixotrophs and heterotrophs) were 34% of the microbial community, and 80% of the eukaryotic biomass. In shallow waters, the eukaryotic chlorophyll-containing community was comprised of pico-sized obligate phototrophs and mixotrophs (233-325 cells mL-1), nano-sized obligate phototrophs and mixotrophs (72 and 374 cells mL-1, respectively), with all groups increasing several-fold in the deep chlorophyll maxima. Mixotrophs were a higher proportion of the chlorophyll-containing community in the shallow nutrient-poor mixed layer, consistent with a nutrient-acquisition argument for their prevalence. Heterotrophic eukaryotes averaged 524 {+/-} 36 cells mL-1 in the euphotic zone, changing little with depth and showing a significant positive relationship with Prochlorococcus, but not any other group. In contrast, mixotrophs were positively correlated with heterotrophic bacteria, but not with Prochlorococcus. Overall, the high proportion of mixotrophs in the microbial community may channel more productivity to higher trophic levels than expected given the regions nutrient-poor status.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

This discovery sheds new lights on the long-standing debate regarding whether a strong magnetic field is an essential prerequisite for origin and the evolution of complex life. Here, we demonstrate that the M-O relationship is not static but highly dynamic across geological timescales using dynamic correlation and variable parameter regression analysis. Intriguingly, periods of weakened M-O coupling coincide precisely with the \"Big Five\" mass extinctions, while the strongest M-O correlation aligns with the Cambrian explosion. Further analysis indicates that shifts in M-O linkage are driven primarily by changes in the magnetic field's trend rather than oxygen fluctuations, with the \"Big Five\" extinctions closely matching inflection points in Earth's magnetic field strength curve. Additionally, human gene age analysis unveils that de novo gene birth rate correlates strongly with mass explosion/extinction and M-O relationship strength, enabling the prediction of such events predating 540 million years ago (Mya) and potentially in the future.

F.; Coughlan, J. M.", "abstract": "Postzygotic reproductive isolation is often thought of as a byproduct of neutral divergence, but it can also evolve rapidly and dynamically. One major contributor to the evolution of intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation is intragenomic conflict, such as conflict between maternal and paternal interests in resource allocation to developing offspring (i.e., parental conflict). One potential reproductive barrier caused by parental conflict is early onset hybrid inviability in developing seeds. Here we show that hybrid seed inviability is segregating within the Mimulus guttatus species complex. Using crosses between 25 populations of Mimulus guttatus, we show that patterns of hybrid seed inviability follow a geographic rather than phylogenetic pattern. We use these crosses, as well as germination assays and embryo rescue experiments, to show that these results are consistent with the parental conflict theory. Using genome sequences from across the complex, we find that high-conflict lineages are not monophyletic, and the repeated occurrence of hybrid seed inviability is, in at least one case, driven by introgression. Our study supports the idea that parental conflict and introgression of selfish elements can contribute to the rapid, repeated, and strong evolution of intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

O. pumila has evolved to possess various adaptations to its arid environment, including a high salt-tolerance and utilization of extreme light conditions, which A. thaliana does not have. However, O. pumila is drastically understudied, despite the advantages of using natural genetic variation and broader contexts in researching the various fields of genomic, cellular, and plant biology. In this study, we attempted to address this lack of important research by contributing to the functional annotation of the genome of O. pumila. One gene was selected and analyzed using various genomic biology softwares -- particularly GenSAS, AUGUSTUS, NCBI BLASTP and MSA Viewer, PSIPRED, AlphaFold, InterPro, STRING, DeepTMHMM, SignalP, TargetP, and WoLF PSORT -- to determine its sequence conservation, three-dimensional structure, function, and subcellular localization. The gene, located on contig tig00000022 of the O. pumila genome, was found to encode oxysterol-binding protein-related protein (ORP) 2B.

Enlarged genomes can be bioenergetically demanding, and active mobile elements can trigger chromosomal rearrangements and loss of gene function. What triggers genome size expansions remains largely unexplored in many biological clades, particularly within the fungal kingdom. Activation of large transposable elements (TEs), such as long-terminal repeats (LTRs), is a common contributor. Yet the mechanisms of LTR activation remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on the fungal genus Pseudocercospora and closely related species with known variation in genome size. In using an assembly-free approach, we found that TE content is highly variable among species, with species-specific retrotransposon families being the main drivers of independent genome expansions. We further focused on the two species with the most expanded genomes and reference-quality genomes, P. fijiensis and P. ulei. We found that the P. ulei genome is compartmentalized, with highly variable TE densities among chromosomal regions, and a striking reduction in pathogenicity-associated genes. Overall, our study indicates that species of Pseudocercospora originally had reduced genome sizes, and genome expansions are species-specific, driven by heterogeneous sets of TE families. Furthermore, we found that in the species with the most expanded genome, TE activity might not have ceased yet as indicated by resequencing data analysis of six strains from diverse locations in Colombia. We discuss what might have caused TE activation and subsequent proliferation in the genus, including stress conditions and host adaptation. Surveys of clades with highly dynamic genome sizes are crucial for the investigation of causal factors driving long-term TE dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Metaproteomics researchers can measure taxonomic and functional abundances of microbiomes, shedding light on mechanistic details of microbiome interactions with their environment. However, metaproteomic analysis suffers from limited depth of coverage due to the presence of millions of peptides at lower abundance levels. Recent advances in data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry coupled with Parallel Accumulation-Serial Fragmentation (PASEF) technology offer improved depth of coverage. PASEF technology enables simultaneous accumulation of ions from multiple co-eluting peptides by combining ion mobility separation with dynamic quadrupole isolation, allowing efficient and selective fragmentation in a single scan. This boosts ion sampling efficiency and resolves overlapping signals with high sensitivity. In this study, we assessed proteome coverage, quantitative precision, and accuracy of Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and Data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods coupled with the PASEF method. For this, we used a ground-truth mock community containing 28 species (30 strains) from all three domains of life and bacteriophages with a 400-fold dynamic range of organism abundance. Our results showed that diaPASEF demonstrated superior performance, identifying 168% more peptide precursors, 155% more peptides, and 66% more protein groups compared to ddaPASEF. Quantitative measurements showed improved precision with diaPASEF, with 26 out of 28 organisms exhibiting coefficient of variation values below 20%, compared to 24 organisms with ddaPASEF. Both ddaPASEF and diaPASEF methods accurately quantified the 22 most abundant organisms, while measurements of low-abundance bacteriophages showed significant deviation from expected values.

We previously demonstrated that native Xenopus cyclase-associated protein 1 (XCAP1) forms a 4:4 complex with actin. Here, we characterized how actin-free XCAP1 and the XCAP1-actin complex interact with actin filaments using high-speed atomic force microscopy and found that XCAP1-bound actin monomers influence dwell time and positional preference of XCAP1 on actin filaments. Actin-free XCAP1 bound to actin filaments transiently with a dwell time of ~0.2 seconds. The XCAP1-actin complex also bound to actin filaments transiently but with a 3- to 5-fold longer dwell time than actin-free XCAP1. Actin-free XCAP1 bound to both side and ends of actin filaments with moderate preference to ends. However, the XCAP1-actin complex bound preferentially to the side of actin filaments.

Local clustering coefficients remained an order of magnitude above random levels, while characteristic path lengths approached those observed in random networks, yielding an exceptionally high small-world index that substantially exceeded typical values previously reported at macroscopic scales.

Immunocompromised patients are at an increased risk to develop chronic HEV infection and thereby severe liver disease. Current off-label regimens are suboptimal with treatment failure being reported.

Combining BEM with ribavirin, the off-label drug given to chronic HEV patients, resulted in an additive antiviral effect against HEV. We further found that HEV-3 remains susceptible to inhibition by BEM even after prolonged exposure, reducing concerns about rapid resistance development.

We developed a generalizable framework to quantify and model these biases using sourdough as a tractable fermentation system, with samples subjected to controlled storage conditions (4, 17, 30degrees Celsius, regularly sampled up to 28 days). Machine-learning models paired with multi-omics profiling - including microbiome, targeted and untargeted metabolome profiling, and cultivation - revealed temperature-dependent shifts in bacterial community structure and metabolic profiles, while fungal communities remained stable. Storage induced ecological restructuring, marked by reduced network modularity and increased centrality of dominant taxa at higher temperatures. Notably, storage duration and temperature were strongly encoded in the multi-omics data, with temperature exerting a more pronounced influence than time. 24 of the top 25 predictors of storage condition were metabolites, underscoring functional layers as both sensitive to and informative of environmental exposure. These findings demonstrate that even short-term ambient storage (< 2 days) can substantially reshape microbiome, metabolome, and biochemical profiles, posing risks to data comparability in decentralized studies and emphasizing the need to recognize and address such biases. Critically, the high predictability of storage history offers a path toward bias detection and correction - particularly when standardized collection protocols are infeasible, as is common in decentralized sampling contexts.

This condition is characterized by body wall lesions, loss of turgor and ray autotomy, which often results in the mortality of specimens. The cause of SSW has remained elusive. A recent report detailing a potential causative agent, Vibrio pectenicida FHCF-3 (Prentice et al., 2025), inspired an investigation into its occurrence in available genomic and transcriptomic data from 2013-2015 from wild specimens and those enrolled in experimental incubations. While Vibrio pectenicida FHCF-3 16S rRNA gene sequences were detected in abnormal body wall tissues of Pycnopodia helianthoides from public aquaria in 2013, they were not detected in grossly normal or abnormal body wall specimens of other species sampled concurrently at sites where mass mortality was observed and from public aquaria. Experimental amendment of Pisaster ochraceus with organic matter substrates led to enrichment of V. pectenicida FHCF-3 16S rRNAs at the animal-water interface, and that they surged in abundance 24h prior to body wall lesion appearance. However, in this experiment V. pectenicida FHCF-3 16S rRNAs were inconsistently detected in coelomic fluid of abnormal specimens, and their abundance at specimen surfaces was inversely related to coelomic fluid detections. Perplexingly, V. pectenicida FHCF-3 was detected in abnormal P. helianthoides treated with 0.2 um filtrates of homogenized tissues, but absent in grossly normal heat-treated filtrate controls in prior work. Vibrio spp, are copiotrophs that experience rapid growth to dominate microbial communities in plankton and tissues when amended to seawater in a mesocosm experiment. These patterns indicate V. pectenicida FHCF-3 might cause abnormalities in P. helianthoides under certain conditions, but its growth might be a secondary rather than primary determinant of disease (i.e. it is saprobic or an opportunistic agent). It remains possible that sea star wasting abnormalities in P. helianthoides represent a generalized response to bacterial infiltration, driven by a diverse set of bacteria which includes but does not require species such as V. pectenicida FHCF-3.

W.; Church, S. H.", "abstract": "The siphonophore Physalia physalis regularly strands along the US East Coast, yet the dynamics driving its seasonal and geographic distribution in this region remain poorly understood. Building on a new understanding of Physalia population structure from genomic analyses, we integrate iNaturalist observational data with a biologically-informed particle-tracking model to investigate the origins, dispersal, and stranding dynamics of P. physalis in the northwest Atlantic. We identify adult and juvenile observations of stranded P. physalis and initialize particles based on juvenile distributions. Our particle-tracking model incorporates recent research on Physalia drift hydrodynamics and high-resolution environmental data to simulate dispersal over twelve months. Results show a winter juvenile peak within a constrained nursery region encompassing the Straits of Florida and Gulf of Mexico. Simulated P. physalis undergo rapid Gulf Stream transport, with limited nursery region recirculation, indicating a source-sink population dynamic. Large-scale distribution of P. physalis is primarily governed by current-driven advection, while wind and wave processes drive nearshore transport and stranding. Using this framework, we characterize the role of the Gulf Stream and seasonal wind patterns in shaping P. physalis strandings in distinct US East Coast regions. We find that mesoscale eddies influence P. physalis transport in offshore regions and theorize that seasonal Gulf Stream dynamics, including eddy activity and shifts in current position and intensity, modulate strandings north of Cape Hatteras. Our study highlights the Gulf Stream's critical role in shaping neustonic distributions in the North Atlantic and the broader transport dynamics that drive dispersal in global Physalia populations.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

M.; Gonzalez, J. M.; Galand, P. E.; Logares, R.", "abstract": "Understanding how marine microbiomes will respond to ongoing global change is crucial. Functional redundancy, the capacity of different microbes to perform the same function, is considered a key mechanism underpinning the stability and resilience of the ocean microbiome. Although the extent of functional redundancy remains debated, investigating its manifestation in environmentally similar and interconnected microbial communities may provide critical insights into its role in shaping microbial community dynamics. We hypothesized that examining the long-term synchrony and rhythmicity of temperate microbial communities in such locations could provide insight into the role of functional redundancy. High functional redundancy at the community level would manifest as rhythmic and synchronous metabolic functions across sites, even in the absence of synchrony or rhythmicity at finer organizational levels, such as individual genes or taxa, thereby contributing to community resilience. Conversely, low functional redundancy would imply that synchrony and rhythmicity extend to both the contributing genes and taxa, suggesting a greater vulnerability of the community to environmental variability. To test this framework, we analyzed the long-term synchrony and rhythmicity of two marine-coastal microbiomes in the Mediterranean Sea, separated by approximately 150 km and connected by a dominant southwest current. Monthly collected metagenomes from a seven-year period were examined at the levels of metabolic functions (e.g., KEGG pathways), predicted genes (open reading frames), and taxa. We found functions, genes, and taxa exhibiting high, low, or anti-synchrony, as well as displaying rhythmic or non-rhythmic patterns. Although rhythmic behavior was observed on average across all organizational levels, consistent with the seasonal dynamics expected in temperate Mediterranean waters, average synchrony across microbiomes remained low. Focusing specifically on 45 markers of key biogeochemical functions, we revealed that several functions exhibited high synchrony and rhythmicity, in sharp contrast to the low synchrony and rhythmicity among the most abundant genes and taxa contributing to those functions. This suggests that functional redundancy and complementary dynamics at lower organizational levels, with distinct taxa contributing to key metabolic functions at different times, lead to rhythmic and synchronous dynamics at higher levels through emergent self-organization. Together, our results highlight functional redundancy and emergent self-organized dynamics as key mechanisms supporting the stability and resilience of marine microbiomes under environmental change.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Our results show marked differences in species composition among forest fragments. El Morro exhibited the highest taxonomic distinctness (TD), supporting a community composed of more distantly related species. In contrast, Uninorte, an isolated urban fragment, had the lowest TD value, suggesting a more taxonomically clustered community and potentially acting as a diversity sink. Nesting values indicate that El Morro functions as a biodiversity reservoir, while the species composition of Los Charcones appears shaped by past land-use changes. The dominance of Myrmicinae and Formicinae aligns with patterns observed in other tropical dry forests. Although fragmentation was not directly assessed, patterns of alpha, beta, and taxonomic distinctness suggest that isolation and land use may influence community composition.

However, despite its success, reliable biomarkers for predicting primary resistance are not available in clinical practice. This study seeks to identify predictors of primary resistance based on novel gene expression signatures using pre-treatment multidimensional profiling in melanoma patients. Methods: The transcriptomic profile of the tumor microenvironment was analyzed using tissue samples from 46 metastatic cutaneous melanoma patients collected prior to the initiation of ICIs therapy. A primary resistance predictive model was trained with the Discovery FFPE RNA-seq sub-cohort and validated using an independent external cohort of 54 samples. Additionally, liquid biopsy samples from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed in 8 patients using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and in 46 patients using flow cytometry to characterize the distribution and abundance of the different immune cell populations. Results: We identified an 82-gene transcriptomic signature composed of tumor- and immune-related genes that stratifies metastatic cutaneous melanoma patients based on primary resistance to ICIs, with key markers including CXCL13, WDR63, MZB1, FDCSP, IGKC and GRIK3. This signature was enriched for pathways related to B cell activation and immune cell communication and achieved an AUC of 0.814 in predictive modeling. Immune deconvolution guided by scRNA-seq revealed four immune cell subsets (Plasma cells, Pre-B cells, Memory CD4 T cells, and Naive CD4 T cells) as prognostic indicators of resistance. Some of these subpopulations were validated by flow cytometry before and after treatment. Conclusions: We propose a transcriptomic biomarker signature that accurately predicts primary resistance to ICIs in metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Through the integration of immune deconvolution with circulating immune cell profiles, we derived an ImmuneSignature linked to patient survival. By combining these approaches, we provide a framework for enhancing the prediction of immunotherapy outcomes and offer a novel strategy for identifying therapeutic targets to overcome resistance.

Using translational SWEET11a-GUS reporter lines under control of the native SWEET11a promoter, we observed progressive infection as indicated by accumulation of SWEET11a-GUS fusion protein in infected coleoptile crown roots. However, we did not detect progression of GUS accumulation beyond the coleoptile node, nor did we detect blight symptoms on the young leaves. Notably, the xylem, at least during early stages of infection remained functional as shown by Rhodamine B tracer, consistent with transfer of xylem constituents via living cells at the coleoptile node that did not allow bacteria to pass. Furthermore, the root infection protocol is a [~]4x faster compared to standard leaf-clipping assays (roots assay: 11 days from sowing, compared to 39 days for clip infection), enabling more rapid assessment of TAL effector repertoire and plant defense responses with translational SWEET-GUS reporter lines.

Oak trees are major constituents of forests of the Northern hemisphere, but are increasingly impacted by climate and disease.

We generated 1657 bacterial, archaeal and fungal metagenome-assembled genomes representing key members of the oak microbiome. Furthermore, the stem microbiome of oak trees with symptoms of Acute Oak Decline, a complex decline disease driven by abiotic and biotic stressors, exhibited reduced bacterial and fungal richness and altered microbiome function.

Target site resistance is a significant challenge to the deployment of these systems. When a double-stranded break is repaired by NHEJ, it can lead to mutations which destroy the target site, making that allele unrecognizable to the sgRNA and resistant to further cleavage. The use of multiple sgRNAs has the potential to solve this issue. We performed experimental crosses to assess the homing and cutting efficiency of two different multiplexing strategies targeting the cardinal locus, in the presence and absence of a resistance allele.

Inactivation/Stability Centers (I/SCs) are recently described autosomal loci that exhibit epigenetic regulation of allelic expression and replication timing, with differences that can be comparable to those observed between the active and inactive X chromosomes 1. Here we characterize hundreds of autosomal loci with allele-specific epigenetic regulation of replication timing and gene expression, defining them as I/SCs. I/SCs are approximately 1 megabase in size and can contain both protein-coding and noncoding genes. In different single cell derived clones, these genes may be expressed from a single allele, the opposite allele, both alleles, or not expressed at all. This stochastic, yet mitotically stable, pattern indicates that the choice of which allele is expressed is independent of parent of origin and independent of the expression status of the other allele. Similarly, alleles within I/SCs show varying replication timing, either earlier or later, that is also independent of the other allele. Additionally, we find corresponding I/SCs in the mouse genome that display conserved synteny with human I/SCs.

To address this, we introduce LCM-FFPEseq, a novel method combining LCM with the advanced Smart-seq3xpress protocol and FFPE-specific adaptations for spatial transcriptomics of FFPE sections. Unlike traditional protocols requiring thousands of cells to generate high-quality libraries, LCM-FFPEseq achieves high sensitivity, reproducibility, and transcript coverage.

Even individual LCM-isolated cells yielded an average of 7,353 or 6,490 protein-coding genes per K562 or Sertoli single cell, respectively. To demonstrate its clinical utility, we applied LCM-FFPEseq to archived testicular FFPE samples from transgender females receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy. Transcriptomic profiling of isolated seminiferous tubules revealed tubular hyalinization to be associated with greater upregulation of extracellular matrix remodelling and inflammatory pathways, alongside stronger downregulation of spermatogenesis-associated pathways.

This pointed to chemo-denitrification and/or fungal denitrification, both characterized by high SP, as possible alternative pathways. We conducted incubation experiments with sediment and bottom-water samples to assess N2O production and reduction dynamics and associated natural-abundance stable isotope signatures. We demonstrate that N2O accumulation predominantly originated from sedimentary production, and that elevated SP values in the bottom water reflected fractional bacterial N2O reduction. Using an isotope mass balance mixing model, we identified bacterial denitrification as the dominant sedimentary process (~75%), followed by chemo-denitrification (~20%), and fungal denitrification (~5%). Additional 15N tracer incubation experiments, combined with selective inhibitors to quantify isolated pathways, confirmed model-estimated contributions.

Through systematic engineering, we designed linear and branched polyhistidine architectures with varied MWs and configurations. In vivo screening identified an optimized pLNP formulation incorporating a symmetrical bis-lysine histidine dendron with a MW of ~1800 g/mol, which achieved a 266-fold increase in liver bioluminescence following intravenous delivery of luciferase mRNA compared to standard LNPs at an equivalent RNA dose. Mechanistic studies revealed that polymer configuration within pLNPs is critical for eliciting the proton sponge effect, leading to osmotic swelling and endosomal rupture. This configuration also promoted rapid endosomal membrane destabilization via a kiss-and-run mechanism, enabling efficient cytosolic release. When delivering base editor mRNA and single-guide RNA, the optimized pLNPs achieved 8% gene editing efficiency in the mouse liver at a low dose of 0.1 mg/kg, compared to 1% with standard LNPs.

Beyond their early patterning function, little is known about whether they control the terminal differentiation and/or function of the fully mature enteric nervous system, the intrinsic nervous system of the gut. We show here that the expression and function of the sole C. elegans FoxA homolog, PHA-4, reaches beyond its previously described pioneer factor roles in patterning the foregut. Through the engineering of neuron-specific cis-regulatory alleles, Cre-mediated cell-specific knockouts and degron-mediated, temporally controlled PHA-4/FoxA removal in postmitotic neurons, we found that PHA-4/FoxA is required not only to initiate the terminal differentiation program of foregut-associated enteric neurons, but also to maintain their functional properties throughout the life of the animal. Moreover, we discovered novel sites of expression of PHA-4/FoxA in extrapharyngeal enteric neurons that innervate the hindgut (AVL and DVB), a GABAergic interneuron that controls foregut function during sleep (RIS), and a peptidergic neuron, PVT, which we implicate here in controlling defecation behavior. We show that while PHA-4/FoxA is not required for the developmental specification of AVL, DVB, RIS, and PVT, it is required to enable these neurons to control enteric functions. Taken together, pha-4 is the only transcription factor known to date that is expressed in and required for the proper function of all distinct types of enteric neurons in a nervous system.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "Immune correlates of protection against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or against tuberculosis disease (TB) remain poorly defined. The ratio of colony forming units (CFUs) to chromosomal equivalents (CEQs), Z=CFUs/CEQs, recovered either from the whole lung (mice) or individual lesions (monkeys or rabbits) of Mtb-infected animals has been used as a metric for how effectively Mtb is killed in vivo. However, the contribution of bacterial killing to changes in the CFU/CEQ ratio during an infection has not been rigorously investigated. We developed alternative mathematical models to study the dynamics of CFUs, CEQs, and their ratio during an Mtb infection. We find that the ratio Z alone cannot be used to infer the death rate of bacteria, unless the dynamics of CEQs and CFUs are entirely uncoupled, which is biologically unreasonable and inconsistent with the view that CEQs reflect an accumulated burden of both viable and non-viable bacteria. Importantly, we estimate a decay rate of 3.6%/day (a half-life of about 20 days) of Mtb H37Rv CEQs in B6 mice that is similar to 4%/day, previously found for Mtb Erdman in cynomolgus macaques. While the estimated Mtb DNA decay rate seems small, we found that estimated rates of Mtb replication and death/killing are still extremely sensitive even to slow decay of Mtb DNA, in part, because Mtb replication and death rates are also small especially during chronic phases of infection. By applying our models to data on Mtb dynamics during the first 3 weeks of infection in macaques, we provide evidence of substantial killing of Mtb bacteria, prior to arrival of adaptive immunity to the site of infection, challenging the previously established notion of non-dying bacteria in the absence of T cell immunity and granuloma formation. We also propose experiments that will allow more accurately to measure the rate of Mtb DNA loss, helping more rigorously quantify impact of immunity on within-host Mtb dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Flowers host microbial communities that can be acquired and vectored by bees to new flowers, establish within the adult bee gut, and enter food stores (e.g., pollen provisions) of developing larvae. Yet, whether microbes vectored by insects or applied for biocontrol can establish across these habitats and if they affect bee fitness remain unknown. Here, we applied microbes to flowers visited by blue orchard bees (Osmia lignaria) and compared microbial communities in flowers, adult bee guts, and pollen provisions before and after inoculation to determine microbial establishment, environmental filtering, and overlap across habitat types. We also inoculated provisions with microbes to test their effects on larval survival and development. Experimentally inoculated microbes were detected in all habitats, demonstrating that flowers are a source of microbial acquisition for adult and larval bees. Additionally, larval health was not impacted by microbe supplementation, indicating tolerance of bee larvae to floral microbes in Osmia.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}
{"title": "From Flexibility to Vulnerability: Targeting P-glycoprotein with Cold Atmospheric Plasma-Derived Reactive Species to Overcome Multidrug Resistance", "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.13.670033", "authors": "Abbasi, H.; Abbasi, H.", "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major obstacle to the efficacy of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Experimental evidence highlights the pivotal role of drug efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp), in this phenomenon. Furthermore, studies underscore the significance of linker region flexibility within Pgp in modulating its function. In this study, we propose a novel non-pharmacological strategy to inhibit Pgp activity by targeting the structural flexibility of its linker region. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the effects of three reactive species generated by cold atmospheric pressure plasma-hydrogen peroxide (HP), nitric oxide (NO), and molecular oxygen (O2)-on the conformational dynamics of the linker. Comprehensive analyses, including conformational entropy, effective spring constants, polymer-like behavior, and hydrogen bonding networks, revealed that these reactive species substantially restrict the structural flexibility of the linker domain. Among them, HP exhibited the most pronounced stiffening effect, primarily driven by stable electrostatic interactions and the formation of strong hydrogen bonds. This reduction in flexibility is likely to hinder the conformational transitions required for drug efflux, thereby locking Pgp in an inactive or impaired state. Our findings not only provide new insights into the structural dynamics of Pgp in response to cold plasma-derived species, but also open up promising avenues for the development of combinatorial therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming drug resistance.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Disrupted inhibitory control is linked to various neuropsychiatric symptoms, making it critical to understand the underlying neural basis. We examined how the tail of the striatum (TS), a major basal ganglia sensory hub, regulates actions to sensory stimuli. Mice performed an auditory Go/NoGo task where we recorded cell-specific activity of TS neurons. Both major striatal types were active during target sounds, but non-target sounds preferentially engaged indirect pathway neurons. Temporarily silencing this activity increased errors to non-target stimuli, indicating a role in suppressing inappropriate action. In mice deficient for the synaptic adhesion molecule Neurexin1, a gene linked to autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, TS indirect pathway recruitment was reduced, and these mice demonstrated auditory-specific inhibitory control deficits. Altogether, these findings highlight a subcortical target to potentially improve attentional and behavioral regulation in neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Intro: Many daily activities involve series of interrelated movements and thus the capacity to learn new motor sequences is vital for everyday functioning. Although learning new skills is especially prominent throughout childhood, remarkably few studies have examined the neural underpinnings of motor sequence learning (MSL) in children. Methods: Twenty-two children (7-11 years) and 23 adults (18-30 years) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while completing two sessions of a MSL task, separated by a 5-hour offline period of wakefulness. Results: Analyses of the behavioral data revealed comparable initial learning in children and adults. However, and consistent with previous research, children exhibited superior motor memory consolidation over the 5-hour offline epoch. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that children exhibited smaller modulations in brain activity between task and rest epochs in a widespread network of areas, including the sensorimotor cortex, supplementary motor area, cerebellum, putamen and regions associated with the default mode network. Similar levels of activity during task and rest epochs in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and somatosensory cortex were associated with better motor memory consolidation in children. Conclusion: Results potentially suggest that the continued engagement of the developing brain during interleaved rest contributes to the childhood advantage in motor memory consolidation.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

However, the link between this bistability and excitation-inhibition balance is not well understood. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that bistability is influenced by two key factors: the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) ratio and the combined strength of excitatory and inhibitory activity (E+I). We developed algorithms to infer both metrics from electrophysiological data and validated them in vivo. In intracranial recordings from epilepsy patients, both E/I and E+I increased during seizures, while interictally, E+I remained elevated in seizure zones as E/I decreased, consistent with compensatory inhibition. Extending the framework to scalp EEG from eight disorders, we found that Alzheimer's disease is better classified by E/I changes, whereas autism spectrum disorder and ADHD are distinguished by E+I alterations. Our findings highlight the importance of bistability in understanding EI regulation and offer handles for diagnostic and treatment decision support.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Their morphology and density influence synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Many proteins in dendritic spines are modified with O-GlcNAc, a monosaccharide that can be attached and removed from serines and threonines. O-GlcNAc has been implicated in multiple brain disorders, yet the role of O-GlcNAcase (OGA), the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc modification from proteins, in dendritic spine regulation remains unclear. This study examines the role of OGA in spine and synapse morphogenesis. Immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses reveal OGA present in dendritic spines. Functional assays show that OGA promotes spine maturation, increases spine density, and alters synapse size. Additionally, OGA modulates the -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), down-regulating GluA2-containing receptors in developing and mature neurons. These findings highlight OGA as a key regulator of excitatory synaptic remodeling and a therapeutic target for synapse-related pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease and autism.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) opens a window to past biodiversity, beyond the fossil record, that can be used to reconstruct ancient environments and ecosystems functions. To this end, modern biodiversity and environmental conditions are used to calibrate transfer functions, that are then applied to past biodiversity data to reconstruct environmental parameters. Doing this with sedaDNA can be challenging, because ancient DNA is often obtained in limited quantities and fragmented into smaller molecules. This leads to noisy datasets, with a low alpha diversity relative to modern DNA, patchy taxa detection patterns and/or skewed relative abundance profiles. How this affects beta-diversity measures, and the performance of transfer functions remain untested. Here we simulated ancient DNA reads counts matrices from synthetic and empirical datasets, and tested 464 combinations of counts transformations, beta-diversity indices, and ordinations methods, and assessed their performance in i) separating the ecological signal from the noise introduced by DNA degradation and in ii) predicting ground-truth environmental conditions. Our results show that commonly used workflows in DNA-based community ecology studies are sensitive to the noise associated to ancient DNA signal. Instead, combinations of methods that include more recent ordination methods proved robust to ancient DNA noise and produced better transfer functions. Our study provides a framework for designing post-processing workflows that are better suited for sedaDNA studies.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Different inversion haplotypes have been associated with susceptibility to microdeletions causing Koolen-de Vries syndrome and variation in fecundity and recombination rates. Here, using 210 haplotype-resolved human genome assemblies and pangenome graph-based approaches we characterize 11 distinct structural haplotypes, several of which have not been previously described. Extending our analyses to a set of haplotype-resolved great-ape genomes, we characterize the structure of a recurrent inversion in chimpanzees which extends an additional 750kb and is ~2 million years younger than the human inversion. We further determine that gorillas exhibit an independent duplication of the KANSL1 gene, disruption of which in humans is the cause of Koolen-de Vries syndrome. Using short read sequencing data we characterize 17q21.31 haplotype diversity worldwide in ~5174 individuals from 107 populations finding increased frequencies of KANSL1 duplication-containing haplotypes in both European and South Asian populations as well as 8 double recombination events between inverted and non inverted haplotypes ranging in size from 20-180kb. Finally, using 626 ancient Eurasian human genomes we show haplotypes containing KANSL1 duplications have increased ~6-fold over the past 12 thousand years in Europe. Together, our results highlight the dynamics, complexity, and recurrent, independent evolution of a medically relevant locus across humans and great apes.", "date": "2025-08-15", "journal": ""}

Alignments to T2T-CHM13 and the 47 Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) linear assemblies positioned 40% and 83% of APG contigs, respectively, with high identity and coverage. Most T2T-CHM13 placements corresponded to sequences absent from GRCh38 (94.5%) and were enriched in centromeric and satellite repeats (94.2%). Functional overlap included annotated genes (2.6%) and CpG islands (3.6%), with enrichment in immune, synaptic and intracellular signaling pathways. HPRC alignments revealed ancestry-associated patterns, with African and Admixed American genomes showing the highest numbers of unique contig placements and shared alignments. A subset of 742 APG contigs showed weak or no mapping to any of the reference assemblies. These contigs were not enriched for repeat elements, and ~58% showed predicted gene content.
