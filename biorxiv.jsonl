This is the case for zooplankton species which ensure the coupling between primary producers and fishes in pelagic food webs. Here, we measured lifespan, reproduction and mobility of laboratory-raised water fleas Daphnia magna, a widespread freshwater zooplankton species, in response to continuous broadband noise. Surprisingly, we found a significant increase in survival and fecundity, leading to a higher individual fitness when considering total offspring production and a slight increase in population growth rate, according to the Euler-Lotka equation. Exposed water fleas were found slower than control individuals and we discussed potential links between mobility and fitness. Our results can have implications in aquaculture and for in-lab studies (e.g., in ecotoxicology) where the acoustic environment receives little attention. Chronic broadband noise can be associated with certain human activities but the consequences on natural Daphnia populations might differ as reduced velocity could have negative outcomes when considering competition and predation. Our work is one of the few showing an effect of noise on individual fitness and suggests that noise should be better accounted for in laboratory studies.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

I.; Mitri, S.", "abstract": "There is increasing interest in artificially selecting or breeding microbial communities, but experiments have reported modest success. Here, we develop computational models to simulate two previously known selection methods and compare them to a new ``disassembly'' method. We evaluate all three methods in their ability to find a community that could efficiently degrade toxins, whereby investment into degradation resulted in slower growth. Our disassembly method relies on repeatedly competing different communities of known species combinations against one another, while regularly shuffling around their species combinations. This approach allows many species combinations to be explored, thereby maintaining enough between-community diversity for selection to act on, and resulting in communities with high performance. Nevertheless, selection at the community level in our simulations did not counteract selection at the individual level, nor the communities' ecological dynamics. Species in our model evolved to invest less into community function and more into growth, but increased growth compensated for reduced investment, such that overall community performance was barely affected by within-species evolution. Within-community ecological dynamics were more of a challenge, as we could control them during the selection process, but community composition and function dropped in the longer term. Our work shows that the strength of disassembly lies mainly in its ability to explore different species combinations, and helps to propose alternative designs for community selection experiments.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Current predictive models focus on genetic adaptation to present climates, providing limited insight into future adaptive capacity.

Combining ecological niche modelling and genomic analyses, we investigated spatiotemporal patterns and mechanisms of local adaptation of the Western Palearctic barn owl (Tyto alba). Ecological modelling revealed that barn owls now occupy a broader climatic niche than during the Last Glacial Maximum. Genomic analyses indicated ongoing adaptation, with regions under selection linked to environmental factors across all populations. Our findings demonstrate that local adaptation drives evolutionary changes across populations, enabling colonisation of new habitats and shaping responses to climate change in resident populations. We demonstrate that standing genetic diversity plays a crucial role in adaptation to past, present, and future environmental shifts.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Despite addressing similar problems, these models remain constrained by field-specific assumptions. We unify them in a generalized resource-distribution framework that yields insights and predictions unreachable by either field alone. Our central finding is that the convexity of the function relating resources to offspring survivorship determines the optimal resource distribution strategy.

Japan is the world largest producer of hatchery salmon, and is located near the global southern distribution limit of chum salmon. Our goal was to identify local and context-specific metrics related to the observed coastwide decline in salmon marine survival over the past two decades. We hypothesized multiple metrics in three categories of stressors: hatchery carryovers, ocean conditions, and predators and competitors. The hatchery carryovers are stressors related to hatchery rearing that affect survival at a different life stage. We collected, processed, and collated large publicly available datasets into a comprehensive open-access database encompassing the life cycle of Japanese chum salmon, from eggs to adult spawners. Multivariate regression models showed associations between stressors and adult salmon return rate (marine survival) varied by coastal management region, salmon life stage, and seasonal high-seas distribution area. In the early marine life history stage, parental egg size and fry size-at-release had the largest positive model effects on marine survival. The sea surface temperature (SST) at time of fry release and a predator of fry had significant negative effects. In the offshore and high-seas life stages, summer SST had negative effects, while winter SST had positive effects. Russian chum and/or pink salmon abundance had negative effects, while no effect was found for North American pink and chum salmon abundance. Generalized additive models (GAMs) identified a nationwide decline in egg size and fry size-at-release. Our study highlights the need for an experimental approach to hatchery practices, including monitoring and analyses with updated information, leading to effective management decisions and policies for future sustainability and conservation of salmon resources.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Erythropoiesis hence requires tight regulation of iron utilization for hemoglobin synthesis. The requirement for iron in erythropoiesis has necessitated the evolution of mechanisms to handle the iron required for hemoglobinization. FAM210B was identified as a regulator of mitochondrial iron import and heme synthesis in erythroid cell culture and zebrafish models. Here, we demonstrate that while FAM210B is required for erythroid differentiation and heme synthesis under standard cell culture conditions, holotransferrin supplementation was sufficient to chemically complement the iron-deficient phenotype. To investigate the role of FAM210B in erythropoiesis, we used knockout mice. While Fam210b-/- mice were viable and did not exhibit overt erythropoietic defects in the bone marrow, the male mice exhibited an increase in serum transferrin suggesting sex-specific alterations in systemic iron sensing. Upon phlebotomy induced stress erythropoiesis, Fam210b-/- mice exhibited differences in serum transferrin levels, and more starkly, had markedly smaller spleens indicating defects in stress response. Fam210b-/- males had defects in neutrophil and monocyte numbers, as well as decreased erythroid progenitor numbers during erythropoietic stress. Together, our findings show that Fam210b plays a key role in splenic response to erythropoietic stress. Our findings reveal a critical role for FAM210B in mediating splenic stress erythropoiesis and suggest it may act as a sex-specific regulator potentially linked to androgen signaling.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used neuronal population voltage imaging to investigate the synchronization patterns of CA1 pyramidal neuronal ensembles during the exploration of a new environment, a critical phase for spatial memory acquisition. We found synchronous ensembles comprising approximately 40% of CA1 pyramidal neurons, firing simultaneously in brief windows (~25ms) during immobility and locomotion in novel exploration. Notably, these synchronous ensembles were not associated with contralateral ripple oscillations but were instead phase-locked to theta waves recorded in the contralateral CA1 region. Moreover, the subthreshold membrane potentials of neurons exhibited coherent intracellular theta oscillations with a depolarizing peak at the moment of synchrony. Among newly formed place cells, pairs with more robust synchronization during locomotion displayed more distinct place-specific activities.

Here, we integrate published data spanning decades of experiments on unicellular chemotrophic growth and compute the corresponding thermodynamic dissipation. Due to its span in chemical substrates and microbial species, this dataset samples the versatility of metabolism. We find two empirical thermodynamic rules: first, the amount of energy dissipation per unit of biomass grown is largely conserved across metabolic types and domains of life; second, aerobic respiration exhibits a trade-off between dissipation and growth, reflecting in its high thermodynamic efficiency. By relating these rules to the fundamental thermodynamic forces that drive and oppose growth, our results show that dissipation imposes tight constraints on metabolic versatility.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

However, the detection and quantification processes are noisy; in particular, peptides may be erroneously detected, and most peptides, known as shared peptides, are associated to multiple protein isoforms. As a consequence, studying individual protein isoforms is challenging, and inferred protein results are often abstracted to the gene-level or to groups of protein isoforms. Here, we introduce IsoBayes, a novel statistical method to perform inference at the isoform level. Our method enhances the information available, by integrating mass spectrometry proteomics and transcriptomics data in a Bayesian probabilistic framework. To account for the uncertainty in the measurement process, we propose a two-layer latent variable approach: first, we sample if a peptide has been correctly detected (or, alternatively filter peptides); second, we allocate the abundance of such selected peptides across the protein(s) they are compatible with. This enables us, starting from peptide-level data, to recover protein-level data; in particular, we: i) infer the presence/absence of each protein isoform (via a posterior probability), ii) estimate its abundance (and credible interval), and iii) target isoforms where transcript and protein relative abundances significantly differ. We benchmarked our approach in simulations, and in two multi-protease real datasets: our method displays good sensitivity and specificity when detecting protein isoforms, its estimated abundances highly correlate with the ground truth, and can detect changes between protein and transcript relative abundances.

This high medical burden is due, in part, to an incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. In a previous study, we identified a cryptococcal atypical ATP-binding cassette (ABC) pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporter, PDR6, that affected antifungal resistance and host interactions. Here, we follow-up on the role of PDR6 in cryptococcal virulence. In vivo, mice infected with the pdr6{Delta} strain display altered symptomatology and disease progression. Specifically, we observed a significant increase in the innate immune cell populations in the pdr6{Delta}-infected mice when compared to their WT-infected littermates. Furthermore, quantification of pulmonary cytokines/chemokines revealed a robust increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice infected with the pdr6{Delta} mutant strain. Despite the documented sensitivity of the pdr6{Delta} strain to azole antifungal drugs, the treatment of pdr6{Delta}-infected animals with antifungals did not affect survival, yet treatment with a corticosteroid significantly extended survival, highlighting the importance of a balanced/controlled host immune response. Results with mice that mount opposing immune responses supports out hypothesis that the pdr6{Delta} strain induces a hyper-inflammatory immune response, and that the mice succumb to immune-dependent tissue damage rather than the fungal burden. This altered immune response is driven, in part, by changes in the mutant's surface.

Strikingly, the fraction of cells exhibiting tensioning increases with increasing strain rate. The tensioning response is accompanied by actin remodeling, and perturbation to actin abrogates it, supporting cell contractility's role in the response. Collectively, our data show that epithelial cells adjust their tensional states over short timescales in a strain-rate dependent manner to adapt to sustained strains, demonstrating that the active pulling-back behavior could be a common protective mechanism against environmental stress.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Studies in urban ecology and evolution often rely on generic indices of urbanization to characterize biodiversity patterns along urban-rural gradients. However, these indices do not permit explicit tests of causal hypotheses by which urbanization mediates ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we show how a graphical causal modeling framework with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to design clear conceptual models to better evaluate mechanistic hypotheses about the effects of urbanization on biodiversity. We introduce the basic structure of DAGs and illustrate their value, first with simulated data and then with a case study on coat color variation in eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) along an urbanization gradient in Syracuse, New York, USA. We show how univariate statistical models with generic urbanization predictors are difficult to interpret and can lead to misleading conclusions about mechanisms in urban ecology and evolution. In contrast, DAGs make causal assumptions transparent and can point to specific processes driving biodiversity patterns. When applied to our case study, analyses informed by a DAG revealed a surprising finding: although squirrel melanism was more prevalent in urban than rural populations, the prevalence of melanism was constrained by components of environmental change common to cities, namely roads, forest loss, and predator activity, in contrast to expectations.

Prior studies have suggested activation of Ca2+ signaling by pyocyanin in an airway cell line, while others have shown apoptotic effects on cancer cells. Ca2+ is tightly linked to both normal mitochondrial function as well as mitochondrial ROS and apoptosis during mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. We found that pyocyanin but not 1-hydroxyphenazine induced both cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ increases in RPMI 2650 and primary human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC). Similar results were seen in HNEC air-liquid interface (ALI) cells, but these cells did not display a cytosolic Ca2+ response after treatment with pyocyanin. In RPMI 2650, activation of PKC, ER Ca2+ release, and PLC inhibition, indicated potential GPCR activation from pyocyanin. Similarly, ROS production increased after treatment with pyocyanin, but not 1-hydroxyphenazine in all 3 cell types, but with stark differences in CF and non-CF ALIs. In HNEC ALI, pyocyanin reduced ciliary beat frequency (CBF) after 4 hours, while 1-hydroxpyhenazine did not. Despite this, both pyocyanin and 1-hydroxyphenazine decreased in cell viability in RPMI 2650 nasal carcinoma cells but not in HNEC at 24 hours. However, in both RPMI 2650 and HNEC, mitochondrial membrane potential acutely decreased after treatment with either pyocyanin or 1-hydroxyphenazine. Finally, 24-hour pyocyanin treatment decreased expression of ER stress genes in some cancer cells, but not in non-cancerous HNEC. Our data suggest that Ca2+ signaling is not required for acute effects of 1-hydroxyphenazine or pyocyanin on mitochondrial function. The greater sensitivity of RPMI 2650 cells to pyocyanin-induced and 1-hydroxyphenzine-induced cytotoxicity compared with primary cells suggests that these compounds might have some applicability in treating nasal squamous carcinomas or other types of head and neck squamous carcinomas. Although the exact mechanisms of pyocyanin induced apoptosis remains uncertain, the downregulation of the ER stress response may play a role.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

While some predictors of internalizing problems are known (e.g., their frequent co-occurrence with neurodevelopmental (ND) conditions), the biological markers of internalizing problems are not well understood. Here, we used deep learning, a powerful tool for identifying complex and multi-dimensional brain-behaviour relationships, to predict cross-sectional and worsening longitudinal trajectories of internalizing problems. Data were extracted from four large-scale datasets: the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, the Healthy Brain Network, the Human Connectome Project Development study, and the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental network. We developed deep learning models that used measures of brain structure (thickness, surface area, and volume) to (a) predict clinically significant internalizing problems cross-sectionally (N=14,523); and (b) predict subsequent worsening trajectories (using the reliable change index) of internalizing problems (N=10,540) longitudinally. A stratified cross-validation scheme was used to tune, train, and test the models, which were evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC). The cross-sectional model performed well across the sample, reaching an AUC of 0.80[95% CI: 0.71,0.88]. For the longitudinal model, while performance was sub-optimal for predicting worsening trajectories in a sample of the general population (AUC=0.66[0.65,0.67]), good performance was achieved in a small, external test set of primarily ND conditions (AUC=0.80[0.78,0.81]), as well as across all ND conditions (AUC=0.73[0.70,0.76]).

Reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) form a bottleneck for descending commands, receiving innervation from diencephalic and mesencephalic locomotor centres and providing locomotor drive to spinal motor circuits. Given their optical accessibility in early development, larval zebrafish offer a unique opportunity to study reticulospinal circuitry. In fish, RSNs are a small, highly stereotyped, uniquely identifiable group of large neurons spanning from the midbrain to the medulla. Classically labelled by tracer dye injections into the spinal cord, recent advances in genetic tools have facilitated the targeted expression of transgenes in diverse brainstem neurons of larval zebrafish. Here, we provide a comparative characterization of four existing and three newly established transgenic lines in larval zebrafish. We determine which identified neurons are consistently labelled and offer projection-specific genetic access to subpopulations of RSNs. We showcase transgenic lines that label most or all RSNs (nefma, adcyap1bccu96Et) or subsets of RSNs, including ipsilateral (vsx2, calcaccu75Et), contralateral (pcp4accu97Tg) or all (tiam2ay264Et) components of the Mauthner array, or midbrain-only RSNs (s1171tEt). In addition to RSNs, selected transgenic lines (nefma, s1171tEt, calcaccu75Et) labelled other potential neurons of interest in the brainstem. For those, we performed in situ hybridisation to show expression patterns of several excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters at larval stages as well as glutamatergic expression patterns in juvenile fish.

Participants varied in multilingual language experience and reading aptitudes, including both typical (TRs) and dyslexic readers (DRs).

In Drosophila, localized mRNA of bicoid serves as anterior determinant (AD). Bicoid engages in a concentration-dependent competition with nucleosomes and initiates symmetry-breaking along the AP axis by promoting chromatin accessibility at the loci of transcription factor (TF) genes that are expressed in the anterior of the embryo. However, ADs of other fly species are unrelated and structurally distinct, and little is known about how they function. We addressed this question in the moth fly, Clogmia albipunctata, in which a maternally expressed transcript isoform of the pair-rule segmentation gene odd-paired is localized in the anterior egg and has been co-opted as AD. We provide a de novo assembly and annotation of the Clogmia genome and describe how knockdown of zelda and maternal odd-paired transcript affect chromatin accessibility and expression of TF-encoding loci. The results of these experiments suggest direct roles of Cal-Zld in opening and closing chromatin during nuclear cleavage cycles and show that Clogmia's maternal odd-paired activity promotes chromatin accessibility and anterior expression during the early phase of zygotic genome activation at Clogmia's homeobrain and sloppy-paired loci. We conclude that unrelated dipteran ADs initiate anterior-posterior axis-specification at the level of enhancer accessibility and that homeobrain and sloppy-paired homologs may serve a more widely conserved role in the initiation of anterior pattern formation given their early anterior expression and function in head development in other insects.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

The two major FTLD pathological subgroups are FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. While the majority of FTLD cases are sporadic, heterogeneity also exists within the familial cases, typically involving mutations in MAPT, GRN or C9orf72, which is not fully explained by known genetic mechanisms. We sought to address this gap by investigating the effect of epigenetic modifications, specifically DNA methylation variation, on genes associated with FTLD genetic risk in different FTLD subtypes. We used frontal cortex DNA methylation profiles from three FTLD datasets containing different subtypes of FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau: FTLD1m (N = 23) containing FTLD-TDP C9orf72 mutation carriers and sporadic cases, FTLD2m (N = 48) containing FTLD-Tau MAPT mutation carriers, FTLD-TDP GRN and C9orf72 mutation carriers, and FTLD3m (N = 163) sporadic FTLD-Tau (progressive supranuclear palsy - PSP) cases, and corresponding controls. We then leveraged FTLD transcriptomic and proteomic datasets to investigate possible downstream effects of DNA methylation changes. Our analysis revealed shared promoter region hypomethylation in STX6 across FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau subtypes, though the largest effect size was observed in PSP cases compared to controls (delta-beta = -32%, FDR adjusted-p value=0.002). We also observed dysregulation of the STX6 gene and protein expression in some FTLD subtypes. Additionally, we performed a detailed examination of MAPT, GRN and C9orf72 across subtypes and observed nominally significant differentially methylated CpGs in variable positions across the genes, often with unique patterns and downstream changes in gene/protein expression in mutation carriers. We highlight aberrant DNA methylation at different CpG sites mapping to genes previously associated with genetic risk of FTLD, including STX6.

Catalogues of mutations associated with resistance to bedaquiline are key to detecting resistance genetically for either diagnosis or surveillance. At present building catalogues requires considerable expert knowledge, often requires the use of complex grading rules, and is an irreproducible process. We developed an automated method, catomatic, that associates genetic variants with resistance (or susceptibility) using a two-tailed binomial test with a stated background rate and applied it to a dataset of 11,867 Mycobacterium tuberculosis samples with whole genome and bedaquline susceptibility testing data. Using this framework we investigated how to best classify variants and the phenotypic significance of minor alleles. The genes mmpS5 and mmpL5 are not directly associated with bedaquline resistance, and our catalogue of Rv0678, atpE, and pepQ variants attains a cross-validated sensitivity and specificity of 79.4 +- 1.8 % and 98.5 +- 0.3%, respectively, for 94 +- 0.4% of samples. Identifying samples with subpopulations containing Rv0678 variants improves sensitivity, and detection thresholds in bioinformatic pipelines should therefore be lowered.

Further spatial density analyses point to assembly formation also independent of major nuclear structures. Some long-range loops share a subset of genomic loci, which serve as nucleation centers and drive loop clustering. These complexes are highly stable, as shown by live-cell imaging with sequence-specific fluorescent labeling, and biophysical model analyses reveal a multivalent binding mechanism.

Pangenome fluidity is often invoked to measure this genome flux. Fluid pangenomes contain genes found only in subsets of species strains. Tighter pangenomes contain more genes that define a shared core. Species definitions are often tied to this pangenome diversity. In any global comparative framework, pangenomes must be calculated across all known species. But defining pangenomes is fraught with computational and biological challenges, requiring assembly, annotation, alignment, and phylogenetics of millions of orthologs. We offer an alternate view that de-centers the gene and emphasizes the raw information content of sequences. Information is data that reduces uncertainty. Tight pangenomes, with elements repeated across every strain in a species ensemble, contain more complete information. In contrast, fluid pangenomes have more uncertainty, higher complexity, and higher information diversity. Bacterial lifestyle has been shown to drive this information diversity. For example, challenging environments often increase information diversity by encouraging the accrual of auxiliary genes. Here, we employ agile complexity metrics to quantify this increase. Ensembles of free-living, motile, and non-pathogenic species have high genomic complexity. Ensemble complexity decreases in species bound to specific hosts. Because we eliminate annotation and alignment, our method is fast enough to evaluate species across all known bacterial genomes.

However, most existing studies focus primarily on transcriptomic data while neglecting the integration of clinical heterogeneity. Although batch correction methods are commonly used, challenges remain when integrating data across different tissues, omics layers, and diseases. This limitation hampers the ability to connect molecular insights to phenotypic outcomes, thereby restricting clinical translation. Furthermore, the technical complexity of analysing large, heterogeneous datasets poses a barrier for clinicians. To address these challenges, we present RNAcompare, a development of RNAcare, employing machine learning techniques to integrate clinical and multi-omics data seamlessly. Results: RNAcompare overcomes these challenges by providing an interactive, reproducible platform designed to analyse multi-omics data in a clinical context. This tool enables researchers to integrate diverse datasets, conduct exploratory analyses, and identify shared patterns across patient subgroups. The platform facilitates hypothesis generation and produces intuitive visualizations to support further investigation. As a proof of concept, we applied RNAcompare to connect omics data to pain, fatigue, drug resistance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and disease severity to RA and Heart Failure (HF). Our analysis reduced selection bias and managed heterogeneity by identifying key contributors to treatment variability. We discovered shared molecular pathways associated with different treatments. Using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values, we successfully classified patients into three subgroups based on age, and subsequent analyses confirmed these age-related patterns. Additionally, we uncovered hidden patterns influencing pain and disease severity across different tissues, omics layers, and diseases. Notably, by integrating Causal Forests and Double Machine learning with clinical phenotypes, RNAcompare provides a novel approach to bypass traditional batch correction methods. Conclusion: We introduce RNAcompare, a computational platform designed to compare clinical and multi-omics data across diverse patient cohorts in real-time.

To date, the peptide PACAP(6-38) and polypeptide M65, which is related to maxadilan, a sandfly vasodilator peptide, have been identified as selective for PAC1. Several non-peptide small molecule compounds (SMOLs) have been reported to be specific antagonists at PAC1, albeit their specificities have not been rigorously documented.

Individual head models were constructed from T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and corresponding pseudo-computed tomography (pCT) data to accurately represent subject-specific skull geometries and the targeted left V5 (V5L) region. Acoustic simulations were conducted with the k-Wave toolbox by first acquiring free-field pressure waveforms and then recording the aberrated waveforms in the presence of the skull. The phase differences between these conditions were used to compute corrective delays for each transducer element. Quantitative evaluation using metrics such as focal overlap with the target region, axial focal positioning, and the delivered ultrasound energy demonstrated significant improvements: the overlap volume increased by 98.70%, mean axial positioning errors were reduced by up to 14.36%, and energy delivery to the target improved by 17.58%. We further demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional ray-tracing methods.

The neonatal piglet model provides a unique opportunity to investigate these differences using strains with defined disease manifestations. We evaluated ten C. jejuni strains previously shown to cause consistent diarrheal manifestations in neonatal piglets: five strains associated with watery diarrhea and five associated with bloody/inflammatory diarrhea. The study found significant strain to strain variation among most assays, but overall strains associated with bloody/inflammatory diarrhea exhibited significantly higher levels of epithelial cell invasion, intracellular survival, macrophage survivability, and disruption of intestinal barrier integrity compared to watery diarrhea strains. Notably, both groups produced similar levels of cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), and elicited comparable IL-8 responses. While both groups facilitated translocation of commensal E. coli, only bloody/inflammatory strains caused increased paracellular permeability, as shown by TEER and FITC-dextran assays. Variation in adherence was observed between groups depending on the cell line used. This study reveals that there is significant variation in the virulence phenotype of C. jejuni strains and identifies several characteristics consistently associated with a specific diarrheal manifestation group.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is most susceptible to injury which leads to deficits in executive function, social behaviors, and cognitive flexibility. Prior research has shown a significant role of the oxytocin (OXT) system in the modulation of social behaviors, and that intranasal OXT (IN-OXT) is potentially neuroprotective. Therefore, we believe IN-OXT could improve behavioral deficits caused by a PFC injury.\n\nMethodsAnimals received a single midline cortical contusion bilaterally damaging the medial PFC (mPFC) and immediately given a single dose of IN-OXT, placebo, or no treatment. Animals were assessed using behavioral and histological measures.\n\nResultsThe results indicated that IN-OXT in jTBI animals mildly improved spatial learning but did not improve spatial memory. Additionally, TBI increased social dominance behavior, but IN-OXT did not mitigate those behaviors. IN-OXT did not alleviate neuroinflammation but did elevate OXT receptors and OXT peptide levels. Furthermore, TBI decreased OXT in the SON of the hypothalamus, and IN-OXT returned OXT levels in this region to normal.\n\nDiscussionThese results show that IN-OXT increases OXT levels in the brain via pathways originating in the SON and improved spatial learning.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Because the antimicrobial spectrum of lantibiotics includes opportunistic pathogens, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), they may provide an approach to reduce antibiotic-resistant infections. The impact of lantibiotic-producing bacteria on the complex microbial populations constituting the microbiome, however, remains poorly defined. We find that genes encoding lanthipeptides, including lantibiotics, are commonly present in the microbiomes of healthy humans and in dysbiotic microbiomes of hospitalized patients. In fecal samples collected from hospitalized patients, bacterial species encoding lantibiotic genes are present in greater abundance than lantibiotic-deficient strains of the same species. We demonstrate that the lantibiotic-producing bacterium, Blautia pseudococcoides SCSK, prevents intestinal recolonization of mice by a wide range of commensal species following antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and markedly reduces fecal concentrations of microbiota-derived metabolites associated with mucosal immune defenses. Lantibiotic-mediated dysbiosis results in sustained loss of colonization resistance against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Clostrioides difficile infection.

These findings position alpha oscillations as a promising target for neuromodulation. In this study, we demonstrate that although alpha frequency is not typically lateralised in a retinotopic manner during working memory retention, such lateralisation can be externally induced. Using alpha closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS), and leveraging the phase-dependent responsiveness of alpha oscillations to sound, we successfully modulated alpha frequency asymmetrically between the visual cortices.

For example, risk preferences, which naturally range from risk-seeking to risk-averse, are characteristically affected in multiple pathologies, e.g. increased risk-taking in gambling disorders. Despite its basic and translational importance, how underlying brain activity reflects and determines behavioral variation is mostly unknown, in part due to the difficulty of directly examining neural activity in decision-relevant brain areas from cohorts of subjects with varying preferences. To address this, we combined human intracranial recordings (n=15 patients) from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain region in economic decision-making, with risky decision-making tasks and computational modeling. We observed significant behavioral variation in risk preferences, which was strongly correlated with low-frequency (delta-theta) oscillatory coherence in OFC. Low-frequency oscillatory phase was coupled to high-frequency activity amplitude, providing a potential neurophysiological mechanism for integrating preferences with trial-by-trial risk computations. Finally, targeted OFC electrical stimulation caused significantly decreased risk-taking behavior and faster reaction times without impairing overall decision-making. These results show a neural correlate for inter-individual variation in decision-making preferences and provide proof-of-principle evidence for modulation of risk-taking behavior through OFC-targeted neurostimulation, paving the way for developing neuromodulatory interventions for pathologies characterized by heightened risk-seeking, such as addiction and gambling disorders.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

P.; Martineau, S.; Nasr, M.; Clemens, J.", "abstract": "How the brain enables individuals to adapt behavior to their partner is key to understanding social exchange. For example, courtship behavior involves sensorimotor processing of signals by prospective partners that can result in behavioral dialogue, such as stereotyped movements and singing. The courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster males with their partners, which are usually female but can also be male, involves singing. To investigate how behavioral feedback and sensorimotor processing contribute to flexible social interactions, we compared the courtship behavior and singing of male D. melanogaster towards males and females. Quantitative analysis of their interactions revealed that while underlying courtship and song rules are unaffected by the sex of the partner, the behavioral dynamics and song sequences differ by partner sex. This divergence stems from sex-specific behavioral feedback: females decelerate to song, while males orient towards the singer. Moreover, optogenetic manipulations reveal that the partners responses are driven by a specific neural circuit that links song detection with arousal and social decisions. Our findings demonstrate that flexible social behaviors can arise from fixed sensorimotor rules through a context-dependent selection facilitated by the partners behavioral feedback.

Here, we present the first comprehensive WM brain charts, which describe how microstructural and macrostructural features of WM evolve across the lifespan, by leveraging over 26,199 diffusion MRI scans from 42 harmonized studies. Using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), we estimate age- and sex-stratified trajectories for 72 individual white matter pathways, quantifying both tract-specific microstructural and morphometric features. We demonstrate that these WM brain charts enable four important applications: (1) defining normative trajectories of WM maturation and decline across distinct pathways, (2) identifying previously uncharacterized developmental milestones and spatial gradients of tract maturation, (3) detecting individualized deviations from normative patterns with clinical relevance across multiple neurological disorders, and (4) facilitating standardized, cross-study centile scoring of new datasets.

Adaptive optics systems, by using deformable mirrors or other wavefront-shaping devices to compensate for optical distortions, enable real-time correction of these aberrations. In this study, we present a practical adaptive optics-assisted 3P imaging system optimized for in vivo functional recordings in the mouse cortex during behaviour. We introduce a hierarchical, three-level aberration correction strategy that sequentially targets aberration caused by the microscope system, the cranial window, and tissue depth. We demonstrate the application of this aberration correction strategy in two anatomically distinct regions: the prelimbic cortex, adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus, and the somatosensory cortex as a representative lateral cortical area, highlighting how aberration sources vary with imaging geometry. Adaptive optics significantly improved imaging performance in both contexts: restoring cellular visibility adjacent to large vascular structures in the prelimbic cortex, and enhancing signal-to-noise ratio during deep imaging in the lateral somatosensory cortex. Together, our work provides a practical framework for implementing adaptive optics-assisted 3P imaging and optimizing deep in vivo functional imaging performance across diverse cortical environments.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

In this study, a miniature pig model was utilized to verify the effect of stereotaxic radiosurgery on a white matter tract with various doses delivered by CyberKnife. As porcine brain bears high resemblance to that of human in size and structure, the potential irradiation-induced change in structures and metabolism was monitored by conventional tools in clinical, including anatomical magnetic resonance image (MRI), diffusion tensor image (DTI) and 18F-Fluoro-D-Glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). The right internal capsule was selected as the surgical target, and a one-year longitudinal study was conducted with whole brain images obtained once per three months. The results indicate that a dose equal to or higher than 60 Gy led to a late-onset radionecrosis which took a period close to 180 d to develop edema and breakage in the blood-brain barrier. In the meanwhile, DTI indices and differential tractography further illustrate a dose- and distance-dependent white matter injury along the tract of internal capsule. In contrast, doses of 40 Gy and below did not result in any discernible harm to the brain structure, but a sustained local inhibition in brain metabolism was observed in some pigs. The modulatory effect of low dose radiation awaits a comprehensive assessment throughout the whole brain in combination with behavioral or cognitive tasks built on pigs.

Here, we investigated if microsaccades--small ballistic eye movements--are equally characterized by FoA and if intention mediates this sense of control. We measured FoA via intentional binding, a perceived compression between an action and its effect. In our experiments, we presented a vertically oriented grating, rendered invisible during stable fixation by a rapid temporal phase shift (>60 Hz) that became visible when its retinal motion was slowed down by a microsaccade (active condition). The stimulus was embedded in a clock face and observers reported perceived stimulus timing in each trial. Perceived timing of microsaccade-contingent stimulus perception was compared to the replay of a previous microsaccade's retinal consequence (replay condition). Trials without a stimulus were included as a control. To examine the role of intention, we tested this paradigm across two experiments in which observers were either instructed to saccade (intended microsaccades) or fixate (unintended microsaccades). In Experiment 2, no instruction was administered such that any microsaccades were considered spontaneous. Microsaccades--either actively generated or replayed--consistently rendered the stimulus highly visible compared to trials without such movements--provided microsaccade direction and peak velocity aligned with the stimulus's motion. Temporal estimates did not differ between the active and replay conditions for any microsaccade type. This result suggests the absence of temporal binding between eye movements and their sensory consequences, and that intention does not facilitate FoA for small eye movements.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

An increasing body of evidence has identified synaptic alterations in patients and experimental models of ALS. Importantly, these have been associated with functional impairments in motor neuron networks, suggesting that synaptic impairments are early events in the disease cascade resulting in functional compensatory reconfigurations. The synapse may therefore represent a disease-modifying target to delay disease progression. In this study, we aimed to stabilize synapses and modify structural connectivity to restore network balance in ALS patient-derived motor neuron networks. To this end, we blocked the potassium channels using tetraethylammonium (TEA) which has been shown to induce chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). The unperturbed ALS patient-derived motor neuron networks developed clear signs of subtle network dysfunction, including increased firing rate and bursting, and accompanying structural abnormalities. These features were partially restored by temporarily blocking the potassium channels. Specifically, the TEA-treated ALS networks were characterized by a reduction in aberrant branching and stabilization of dendritic spines, alongside a temporary reduction in firing rate and bursting. Furthermore, protein expression assays revealed restoration of dysregulated molecular pathways, including protein synthesis and metabolic pathways, and upregulation of pathways involved in synapse organization in the TEA-treated ALS networks.

This visual stability is paralleled by the curious case of afterimage movement across saccades: Albeit being stabilized retinotopically, afterimages appear to move in egocentric space wherever the eye moves. While this phenomenon has been known for centuries, the exact relationship between eye and afterimage position remains elusive. Using custom-built presentation hardware in complete darkness, we subjected twelve human observers to a novel task, in which they viewed a bright foveal inducer pulse during fixation, executed a saccade to a previously cued location, and performed spatial localization of the emerging afterimage with respect to a sequence of briefly flashed probes. This psychophysical tracking of afterimages was accompanied by high-precision eye tracking, allowing us to estimate afterimage-movement gain by fitting a dedicated computational model to the data. We found that the size of afterimage movement was tightly contingent upon the size of the corresponding eye movement, but yielding significantly hypometric gains which averaged to 0.94 and were remarkably stable across experimental sessions. Gains were unaffected by (even false) post-saccadic visual feedback and remained constant when saccade amplitudes were successfully adapted to significantly lower gains. Regardless of saccadic adaptation, afterimage-movement gains were inversely related to saccade gain - a finding that could be explained by a parsimonious efference-based model of head-centered visual localization. Our results suggest that afterimage movement across saccades is driven by feedforward prediction of the visual consequences of impending saccades and demonstrate the potential of the afterimage-tracking technique for studying sensorimotor processes involved in active vision.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Thus, a valuable tool for assessing mucosal immune response to immersion vaccination is still lacking in most commercial fish species. In this study, we expressed and purified recombinant protein of the heavy chain constant domains (CH) 1-2 of grass carp IgT and immunized mice to develop a mouse anti-grass carp IgT monoclonal antibody (mAb). Western blotting results showed that the mAb could specifically recognize grass carp IgT without cross-reacting with grass carp IgM, IgMT1 or IgMT2. We then measured IgM and IgT concentrations in the serum and gill mucus of grass carp and examined the responses of specific IgM and IgT to immersion immunization with grass carp reovirus genotype (GCRV-) and Flavobacterium columnare. We found that the concentration of IgT in gill mucus was higher than that in serum, and the IgT/IgM ratio in gill mucus was much higher than that in serum. Moreover, after immersion immunization, the specific IgT levels in gill mucus increased significantly, while no specific IgT was detected in serum. In contrast, the specific IgM levels in serum increased significantly, whereas there was little change in specific IgM levels in gill mucus. These results indicated that IgT is an important immunoglobulin in mucosal immune response, whereas IgM plays an important role in systemic immune response in grass carp.

However, the utility of this approach to improve water buffalo has been largely unexplored. We present a comprehensive pangenome that integrates four newly generated, highly contiguous assemblies of Pakistani river buffalo with available assemblies from both sub-species. This doubles the number of accessible high-quality river buffalo genomes and provides the most contiguous assemblies for the sub-species to date. Using the pangenome to assay variation across 711 global samples, we uncovered extensive genomic diversity, including thousands of large structural variants absent from the reference genome, spanning over 140 Mb of additional sequence. We demonstrate the utility of these data by identifying putative functional indels and structural variants linked to selective sweeps in key genes involved in productivity and immune response across 26 populations. This study represents one of the first successful applications of graph genomics in water buffalo and offers valuable insights into how integrating assemblies can transform analyses of water buffalo and other species with complex evolutionary histories. We anticipate that these assemblies, and the pangenome and putative functional structural variants we have released, will accelerate efforts to unlock water buffalo's genetic potential, improving productivity and resilience in this economically important species.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

In neurotypical individuals (n=100), we found a reduction in the preference for free choice across self- and charity-benefiting environments when freely chosen options yielded divergent sensory outcome distributions, but not when the outcome distributions of available options were identical, i.e., only when free choice afforded instrumental control. In individuals with obsessive-compulsive traits (n=108) this pattern was reversed, suggesting an unchanged preference for control in charity-benefiting environments. Computational cognitive modeling confirmed a selective reduction in the subjective utility of instrumental control, dissociable from that of free choice, outcome divergence, and monetary reward maximization, in neurotypical individuals gambling for charities.

Here, we report the 2.2 angstrom cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human Stomatin complex in a native membrane environment. We find that Stomatin assembles into a 16-subunit ring-shaped homo-oligomer, forming a ~12nm-wide cage that defines a mechanically distinct, curvature-resistant membrane microdomain. While the majority of the complex exhibits C16 symmetry, the C-terminal domains adopt two alternating conformations, producing a symmetry-broken hydrophobic {beta}-barrel pore with local C8 symmetry. The membrane beneath the complex remains flat despite surrounding curvature, indicating localized membrane stiffening. The structure reveals a conserved network of inter-subunit salt bridges that stabilize the assembly.

P.", "abstract": "The basic Helix-Loop-Helix-Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) transcription factors (TFs) are regulators of several critical cellular functions such as circadian rhythm, hypoxia response and neuronal development. These proteins contain tandemly repeated PAS domains that mediate heterodimer formation. While PAS domains adopt a conserved fold, recent studies suggest that their interaction interfaces differ distinctly in different TF complexes. However, the implications of these differences on the intrinsic dynamics of PAS domains remain unclear. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of PAS domain dynamics across multiple bHLH-PAS TF complexes using all-atom Elastic Network Models (ENMs) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We decomposed the intrinsic dynamics of PAS domains into self-coupled (internal domain dynamics) and directly coupled (interaction partner-influenced dynamics) motions using a projection-based approach. Our results show that self-coupled motions are more conserved across PAS domains than structure or sequence alone, while directly coupled motions capture the context-specific influence of partner proteins. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering of the overall covariance-based similarity scores revealed distinct grouping of CLOCK:BMAL1-type and HIF:ARNT-type complexes, which were not captured by sequence or structural comparisons. Root mean square fluctuation profiles derived from both MD and ENM approaches showed strong correspondence, validating the utility of ENMs in capturing biologically relevant dynamics, even in cases where the structural complexes were modelled using AlphaFold3. PAS-B domains were generally found to be less flexible than PAS-A domains for all the complexes analysed. Regions with high directly coupled flexibility were generally localized regions with high interface propensity in class I PAS-B domains, suggesting a higher level of coupled dynamics between PAS-B domains. Our results highlight how PAS domain intrinsic dynamics are shaped by both their internal architecture and complex-specific interactions, offering new insights into the functional diversification of bHLH-PAS transcription factors.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

In this study, we employ bright-field differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) to investigate density fluctuations inherent in a cell-free model of eukaryotic cytoplasm. Our measurements reveal subdiffusive fractional Brownian motion and non-Gaussian displacement distributions, highlighting cytoplasmic heterogeneity. We introduce an empirical model that combines fractional Brownian motion with an inverse Gaussian distribution of diffusivities to describe the observed non-Gaussianity. Validated through Monte Carlo simulations, this model allows us to estimate the fractional diffusivity and exponent effectively. By altering macromolecular composition, the addition of energy, and assembly of a cytoskeleton, we identify three independent mechanisms that result in similar fractional exponents yet distinct diffusivities.

To discover which lipids might support phase separation in cell membranes and how lipids might partition between phases, miscibility phase diagrams have been mapped for model membranes. Typically, model membranes are composed of ternary mixtures of a lipid with a high melting temperature, a lipid with a low melting temperature, and cholesterol. Phospholipids in ternary mixtures are chosen primarily to favor stable membranes (phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins) or add charge (phosphatidylglycerols and phosphatidylserines). A major class of phospholipids missing from experimental ternary diagrams has been the phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs). PE-lipids constitute up to 20 mol% of common biological membranes, where they influence protein function and facilitate membrane fusion. These biological effects are often attributed to PE's smaller headgroup, which leads to higher monolayer spontaneous curvatures and higher melting temperatures. Taken alone, the higher melting points of saturated PE-lipids imply that liquid-liquid phase separation should persist to higher temperatures in membranes containing PE-lipids. Here, we tested that hypothesis by substituting a saturated PE-lipid (DPPE) for its corresponding PC-lipid (DPPC) in two well-studied ternary membranes (DOPC/DPPC/cholesterol and DiphyPC/DPPC/cholesterol). We used fluorescence microscopy to map full ternary phase diagrams for giant vesicles over a range of temperatures. Surprisingly, we found no micron-scale, liquid-liquid phase separation in vesicles of the first mixture (DOPC/DPPE/cholesterol), and only a small region of liquid-liquid phase separation in the second mixture (DiphyPC/DPPE/cholesterol). Instead, coexisting solid and liquid phases were widespread, with the solid phase enriched in DPPE. An unusual feature of these ternary membranes is that solid and liquid-ordered phases can be distinguished by fluorescence microscopy, so tie-line directions can be estimated throughout the phase diagram, and transition temperatures to the 3-phase region (containing a liquid-disordered phase, a liquid-ordered phase, and a solid phase) can be accurately measured.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

To address these limitations, we developed SLIDE-EX (SLide-based Inference of DEconvolved gene EXpression), a deep-learning tool that predicts cell type-specific gene expression and abundances directly from routine breast cancer histopathology whole slide images (WSIs), using deconvolved bulk RNA-seq data as training labels. Trained on the TCGA-breast cohort and tested in cross validation and on an independent cohort of 160 cases, SLIDE-EX robustly infers the expression of thousands of genes across 9 distinct cell types, performing best for cancer associated fibroblasts and cancer cells. The abundance of these two cell types could also be robustly predicted, together with that of myeloid cells. The robustly predicted genes reflect key biological functions of their respective cell types. From a translational perspective, the inferred cell type specific expression profiles predict chemotherapy response more accurately than models based on direct prediction from the slides or from the inferred bulk expression in two independent cohorts.

Here we demonstrate that, in numerous preclinical models of lung tumorigenesis, BRAFV600E signaling promotes expression of ligands including HB-EGF, TGF Alpha;, Epi- and Amphiregulin. Moreover, using both genetic or pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that ligand-mediated activation of EGFR signaling in the tumor cell is required to sustain both early-stage BRAFV600E-driven lung tumorigenesis and supports late-stage BRAFV600E-driven lung cancer maintenance. Unbiased Reverse Phase Protein Analyses (RPPA) analyses, paired with targeted validation, reveals ERBB signaling serves to sustain signaling through the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway, through effects on ARAF and CRAF, and on the parallel JUN kinase (JNK) pathway. Furthermore, EGFR is activated in a cohort of BRAF-mutated lung cancer patients both pre- and post-treatment. Finally, we noted significant improvement in the depth and durability of therapeutic responses in preclinical models of BRAFV600E-driven lung cancer by combined inhibition of both BRAFV600E signaling plus pan-ERBB signaling.

Here we demonstrate that tumor perfusion critically influences systemic immune responses to combination therapy with radiation and PD-1 blockade. Using multimodal imaging including DCE-MRI, EPR oximetry, and hyperpolarized 13C-MRI, we show that successful abscopal responses in MC38 tumors are characterized by enhanced perfusion, reduced hypoxia, decreased cellularity, and lower glycolytic activity in remote tumors. Notably, pre-treatment perfusion metrics (AUC1min) and extracellular volume (AUC10min) in primary tumors predict subsequent growth of remote tumors, while the same measurements in remote tumors lack predictive value. Based on these findings, we enhanced the abscopal effect by exposing mice to carbogen (95% O2 + 5% CO2) during radiation therapy. Carbogen exposure increased tumor perfusion by 71% (AUC1min) and significantly improved systemic responses in the checkpoint blockade responsive MC38 model but not in the poorly responsive B16.F10 tumors. The enhanced response correlated with increased activation of CD8+ T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes and elevated serum HMGB-1 levels.

In this study, we found that induction 1, comprising mitoxantrone-etoposide-cytarabine in nearly all patients (as part of the NOPHO-DBH AML-2012 protocol), led to preserved or increased relative lymphocyte abundances alongside marked blast reduction in most cases. This was accompanied by a shift towards higher T-cell fractions, potentially creating a favorable window for BiTE therapy. The absence of a correlation between blast reduction and lymphocyte changes suggests that chemotherapy exerts differential effects on the lymphocyte compartment. Despite the heterogeneity of agents used in induction 2, more than half of patients showed a decline in lymphocyte levels. Nonetheless, the increase in T- and B-cells observed in most patients from the NOPHO-AML 2004 cohort after induction 2 suggests that lymphocyte recovery at this treatment stage is not uniformly impaired. Our transcriptomic and ex vivo functional data align with preclinical findings in adult AML and provide a basis for further investigations in in vivo models and early clinical trials. Such efforts should prioritize novel BiTE constructs targeting multiple tumor-associated (e.g., NCT05673057) or tumor-specific antigens.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

The perception of stress, frequently through the nervous system, can lead to physiological changes that are fundamental to maintaining homeostasis. Activating the response to low oxygen, or hypoxia, extends healthspan and lifespan in C. elegans. However, despite some positive impacts, negative effects of the hypoxic response in specific tissues prevent translation of their benefits in mammals. Thus, it is imperative to identify which components of this response promote longevity. Here, we interrogate the cell-nonautonomous hypoxic response signaling pathway. We find that HIF-1-mediated signaling in ADF serotonergic neurons is both necessary and sufficient for lifespan extension. Signaling through the serotonin receptor SER-7 in the GABAergic RIS interneurons is necessary in this process. Our findings also highlight the involvement of additional neural signaling molecules, including the neurotransmitters tyramine and GABA, and the neuropeptide NLP-17, in mediating longevity effects. Finally, we demonstrate that oxygen- and carbon-dioxide-sensing neurons act downstream of HIF-1 in this circuit. Together, these insights develop a circuit for how the hypoxic response cell-nonautonomously modulates aging and suggests valuable targets for modulating aging in mammals.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

This is largely independent of its catalytic activity and occurs through modulation of the secretory pathway. METTL9 interacts with key regulators of cellular transport, endocytosis and Golgi integrity; moreover, in Mettl9KO cells Golgi becomes fragmented.

However, Notch3 is a less potent inducer of Notch signaling activity compared to Notch2, due to weaker interactions between the Notch3 intracellular domain and RBPJ{kappa}. Accordingly, unlike Notch3, Notch2 depletion causes an almost total loss of Notch activity and differentiation in large arteries. In smaller arteries, the loss of Notch2 is partially compensated for by a higher SMC expression of Notch3. Our results, therefore, indicate that SMCs have artery-typical vulnerability to altered Notch2 and Notch3 signaling, contributing to our mechanistic understanding of the Notch-related vascular disease onset.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Serum markers provide an alternative way to monitor the brain, but relatively few such markers exist. Additionally, the origin of serum markers often cannot be localized to a specific cell population, and monitoring dynamic changes in their gene expression is compromised by the same factor that makes the markers detectable - long serum half-life. Here we propose a paradigm to improve the sensi-tivity of serum marker measurement by modifying the markers in vivo, called erasable serum markers, or ESM. As a proof of concept, we use a well-controlled system with known half-life and tunable serum levels. This system, released markers of activi-ty, or RMAs enable measurement of transgene expression in the brain through a simple blood test. RMAs are stable in blood, with a half-life of >100 h and can detect expression from as few as 12 neurons in mice. However, their long serum half-life also generates long-lasting background signals when RMA are used to track temporal changes in gene expression. By engineer-ing on-demand erasable RMAs and injecting an intravenous targeted protease, we reduced RMA background signal by more than an order of magnitude without compromising the detection sensitivity. Similarly to previous RMA iteration, our ap-proach showed a 65,000-fold increase in their signal over the baseline when expressed in a single brain region. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this erasable RMA system improves the dynamic range of detection for low-level promoter activity that is driven by physiological levels of c-Fos.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Starting with an NMR-derived ensemble of NPSL2 structures, we identified ligandable cavities within NPSL2 using RNACavityMiner. We then used molecular docking to screen the ZINC library against these cavities to identify potential small molecule hits. A sampling of commercially available compounds from the initial hits were purchased for experimental characterization by saturation transfer difference (STD) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy. This approach led to the identification and characterization of at least eight compounds that bind preferentially within the internal loop of NPSL2.

Simulations based on a cryo-EM structure at pH 3 revealed critical steps in the transport mechanism, including release of Cl- ions to the extracellular side, opening of the inner gate, and novel water wires that facilitate H+ transport. Surprisingly, these water wires occurred independently of Cl- binding, prompting us to reassess the relationship between Cl- binding and Cl-/H+ coupling. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and quantitative flux assays on mutants with reduced Cl- binding affinity, we conclude that, while Cl- binding is necessary for coupling, even weak binding can support Cl-/H+ coupling.

This study, for the first time in NSCLC cells including those without a targetable TK mutation, explores a tumor-suppressive activity of siRNA knockdown of a splicing factor SRSF3, which was reportedly effective in other cancer cell types. The knockdown of SRSF3 increased cellular senescence, indicated by senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity and reduced cell proliferation, in all NSCLC cell lines examined, including A549 (no TK mutation; TP53 wild-type), NCI-H1975 (EGFR L858R/T790M; TP53 R273H mutant), NCI-H322 (no TK mutation; TP53 R248L mutant) and NCI-H596 (no TK mutation; TP53 G245C mutant). An increase in apoptotic cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was also observed in A549 cells. p53{beta}, a tumor-suppressive p53 isoform generated via alternative mRNA splicing, was upregulated by SRSF3 knockdown, as previously reported in normal fibroblasts. However, neither cellular senescence nor apoptosis was increased by overexpression of p53{beta}, suggesting no or minimum contribution of this p53 isoform to the tumor-suppressive activity of SRSF3 knockdown in NSCLC cells. Our gene expression assay indicated that the SRSF3 knockdown-induced senescence in NSCLC cells may be mediated by downregulation of TOP2A, UBE2C or ASPM, which are known to be oncogenic and are associated with poor patient prognosis. We also generated SRSF3 siRNA-encapsulating lipid nanoparticles as a future therapeutic tool.

While transcriptional and epigenetic variability have been separately linked to hypoxia responses, the integrated impact of hypoxia on gene regulation and clonal architecture in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) remains poorly defined. We applied single-nucleus multiomics ntegrating RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to patient-derived GSCs cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. This enabled simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility within the same cells. Transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks were inferred using Dictys, while RNA-chromatin dynamics were modeled with MultiVelo. Clonal structure and copy number variations (CNVs) were resolved at single-cell resolution using RID- DLER on snATAC-seq data. Hypoxia induced the emergence of four distinct GSC subpopulations with unique transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles enriched for mesenchymal, angiogenic, and proliferative signatures. Regulatory network modeling revealed novel hypoxia-associated TFs like SP2, CREM, and ETV3 that modulate downstream oncogenic pathways. Trajectory analysis uncovered hypoxia-driven reversals in RNA-chromatin coupling, revealing dysregulated future transcriptional states of key genes such as MMP16 and SVIL. CNV profiling identified 13 clonal substructures, with specific clones (e.g., 5, 6, 9) selectively enriched under hypoxia and harboring distinct chromosomal alterations. These results demonstrate coordinated remodeling of GSC gene regulation and clonal fitness in response to hypoxic stress.

Our investigation presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of five distinct methodological frameworks for predicting rat plasma concentration-time profiles: four approaches that integrate mechanistic modeling with computational techniques, and one approach employing pure machine learning (ML) architecture without physiological constraints. As reference (1), we used a method that predicts non-compartmental analysis (NCA) parameters to predict plasma PK profiles with a one-compartmental PK model (NCA-ML). Alternative approaches include: (2) a physiologically based PK (PBPK) model utilizing ML-predicted in vitro characteristics; (3) CMT-ML, where neural networks predict compartmental PK model parameters; (4) CMT-PINN, employing physics-informed neural networks; and (5) PURE-ML, using decision trees to predict concentration values at specific timepoints based on predicted volume of distribution and clearance. Assessment using multiple performance metrics demonstrated that the CMT-PINN approach achieved superior predictivity for PK profiles. Models trained directly on concentration-time, rather than derived PK parameters, delivered markedly improved predictive performance, particularly when working with limited training datasets. Our findings confirm the viability of predicting PK behavior from molecular structures before synthesis, representing a significant advancement for subsequent design.

To examine the role of IL-26 in early life, we used zebrafish and found that gut epithelial cells in il26-/- larvae exhibited increased proliferation and DNA damage, faster turnover, and an altered abundance of cell populations. This epithelial dysregulation occurred independently of the IL-26 canonical receptor and resulted from dysbiosis in il26-/-. Moreover, IL-26 bactericidal activity was conserved in zebrafish. Our findings suggest that IL-26 directly regulates microbiota composition through this property.

Unexpectedly, we show that FtICD is present in the nucleus in cultured cells as well as in embryonic and larval tissues, and identify nuclear localization and nuclear export signals in FtICD required for this localization. We show that membrane-bound FtICD is cleaved and enters nuclei in vivo. Using endogenously tagged Ft as well as overexpressed FtICD we conducted ChIP-seq experiments and identified putative Ft targets including genes involved in signaling pathways, chromatin organization, pattern formation, and neural development. RNAseq demonstrates that some of these genes are differentially regulated in ft mutants. We observe strong correlations of Ft binding regions with peaks for other factors such as DREF and BEAF-32, as well as the Hpo pathway components Yorkie (Yki) and Scalloped (Sd), suggesting that Ft may act in conjunction with these factors to regulate gene expression.

One way to gain insight into how cell types evolve is to investigate the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that pattern them, leading to the identification of shared and divergent programs that likely represent components of the ancestral and evolved phenotypes. Efforts to identify early acting transcription factors in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis revealed that NvfoxE-like is a lineage-restricted cnidocyte transcription factor. Expression and functional studies confirmed that NvfoxE-like and its targets are found exclusively in cnidocytes. By investigating interactions with regulators of the known cnidogenesis GRN and comparing the targets of known cnidocyte regulators, we identified at least four regulatory programs contributing to the cnidogenic GRN in Nematostella. The previously identified cnidocyte regulators Nvznf845 and NvpaxA represent two core pan-cnidarian regulatory programs, while the NvfoxE-like dependent program appears to be restricted to Hexacorallia or Actinaria, where we hypothesize it functions to pattern the unique capsule features present in those lineages.

Little is known about genome plasticity of Histoplasma, which we address in this study with the ultimate goal of increasing our understanding of its pathogenicity. This study addresses the Histoplasma genome and its plasticity to further our understanding Histoplasmas ability to cause severe disease. Here we present the first telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies for Histoplasma ohiense. To analyze genome alterations between isolates, we develop an analysis tool to identify genome discontinuities relative to a reference genome. We utilize this analysis to interrogate the genome of laboratory strains and natural Histoplasma isolates and discover that the previously published reference genome does not completely match the chromosome structure of the majority of isolates, instead harboring reciprocal chromosome translocations. We identify the telomere-to-telomere Histoplasma ohiense reference genome that is most representative of clinical isolates. Additionally, to determine the rate of Histoplasma genomic changes, we sequence 46 passaged isolates and calculate the mutation rate to be 2.6 x10-10 SNP/base/doubling--the first such measurement to our knowledge within the order Onygenales, which encompasses several critical fungal pathogens. Finally, we sequence populations of cells to assess genome stability over the course of a month under both yeast and hyphal growth conditions. Interestingly, we observe that transposon signal is not static over time and instead increases during growth in both the yeast and hyphal forms as well as through morphologic transitions, suggesting an increase in transposon copy number.

However, in pancreatic islets, some haemodynamic changes occur before the onset of symptoms. The underlying mechanisms driving islet vascular abnormalities have not been fully characterized, but islet pericyte dysfunction appears to be an early event in the pathogenesis of human type 1 diabetes (T1D). It remains to be investigated, however, how abnormal pericyte physiology affects their ability to regulate islet blood flow and vascular permeability. To address this issue, we treated mice with multiple subdiabetogenic doses of the beta cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ; 50mg/kg) and recorded islet vascular responses when animals developed glucose intolerance but were still not diabetic (average fed glycemia <200 mg/dL). At this stage, accompanying increased macrophage density, islet pericytes adopted a myofibroblast-like appearance and interacted closely with endothelial cells expressing high levels of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1. This phenotypical switch of pericytes in STZ-treated mice had functional repercussions: it impacted glucose-induced vasomotor responses ex vivo in living pancreas slices and hyperglycemia-stimulated increases in islet blood flow recorded in vivo in the exteriorized pancreas. Impaired vasomotor responses were accompanied by enhanced extravazation of a fluorescent dextran (500 kDa) from vessels and accumulation in the interstitial space surrounding islets in STZ-treated mice. Our study indicates that abnormal pericyte function, and compromised capacity to regulate blood flow and vascular integrity, are part of a pathogenic process occurring in islets before diabetes onset, associated with a loss of functional beta cell mass and inflammation.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Tumor growth leads to hypoxia, and HIF1 and HIF2 are important regulators of hypoxia induced pathways, inducing angiogenesis and tumor growth. This study compares the expression levels of HIF1 and HIF2 mRNA in OSCC tissues to adjacent normal mucosa. Methods: RNA was isolated from 85 OSCC tissues and adjacent normal mucosa followed by real-time (RT) PCR to quantify HIF1 and HIF2 expression using GAPDH and -actin respectively as reference genes. Results: HIF1 overexpression was detected in 76.47% of case and 71.76% of controls (p=0.4906), whereas HIF2 overexpression occurred in 91.76% of cases 94.11% of controls (p=0.35). HIF1 and HIF2 expression level were not significantly different in OSCC tissues compared to adjacent normal mucosa. Conclusion: HIF1 and HIF2 play important role in hypoxia induced pathways and tumor progression, yet this study found no significant variation in expression between OSCC tissues and surrounding normal tissues. This suggest that their expression may be due to physiological adaptability to hypoxia or stress, or may be due to use of adjacent tissue as control and loss of protein expression could be due to post translational modifications.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Although leucine and other components of the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway are known TORC1 regulators, how the BCAA pathway is controlled across this transition and influences the crosstalk between central carbon and amino acid metabolism remains unclear. By integrating high-throughput flow cytometry and untargeted LC-MS metabolomics into a thermodynamically curated genome-scale model, we profiled protein levels, metabolite dynamics, and cellular context during the diauxic shift of a GFP-tagged strain library of the BCAA pathway in wild-type and mutants lacking non-essential genes for BCAA biosynthesis. This analysis revealed that the BCAA pathway operates in two branches, with only the leucine-committed branch exhibiting a fermentative signature aligned with TORC1 activity. We further identified key regulatory elements and showed that dysregulation of the BCAA pathway disrupts distant metabolic circuits, including central carbon metabolism. Our findings highlight the dynamic role of the BCAA pathway in metabolic network integration during the diauxic shift.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Second, we simulate calcium imaging signals from the same dataset and confirm that the estimated functional connectivity is influenced by shared inputs and population synchronization on slower timescales. Notably, even with unrealistically fast calcium dynamics, the functional connectivity is only partially consistent with the monosynaptic connectivity. These findings suggest the complementary roles for monosynaptic and functional connectivity: the former provides circuit-level specificity, while the latter reflects emergent system-wide patterns of activity.

A subset of R genes exhibit unusually strong signatures of balancing selection, sometimes even existing as trans-specific polymorphism. Here, we explore the role of alternative hosts on R gene evolution through a simple model of two closely related host species that share a single generalist pathogen. We ask (i) how shared interactions determine the R gene repertoires and polymorphism in each host and (ii) under which circumstances trans-specific polymorphism is maintained. Our results indicate that interactions with a generalist pathogen are more likely to sustain polymorphism at a shared ancestral R gene compared to the maintenance of polymorphism at R genes private to each host. The former often translates into trans-specific resistance gene polymorphism. Further, we observe that increasing the relative proportion of a single host species favors fixation of private resistance in the less common host, as the pathogen tracks the more common host. Thus, our model sheds light on how R gene dynamics are shaped by interactions with a shared generalist pathogen and the pathogen's response to unequal host frequencies.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter with vasodilatory and antioxidant properties. The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of H2S on erectile function, penile ROS, and expressions of endogenous antioxidant genes and proteins in the corpus cavernosum. These objectives were tested by 1) comparing wild type mice to mice deficient in cystathionine {gamma}-lyase (CSE-/-), a major endogenous source of H2S; and 2) by feeding wild type mice a control diet or high-fat, high-sucrose Western style diet (WD) for 18 weeks, with subgroups treated with and without the H2S prodrug SG1002 for the final 6 weeks of the dietary intervention. Erectile function was assessed by cavernous nerve-stimulated intracavernous pressure measurement, penile interstitial ROS was measured with a microdialysis approach, and cavernous gene and protein expression assessed by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Erectile function was impaired in CSE-/- mice and following the WD, which was significantly improved in WD mice treated with SG1002. Penile ROS levels were increased in CSE-/- mice and following the WD, which were suppressed in WD mice treated with SG1002. The following genes were commonly decreased in CSE-/- mice and increased by SG1002 treatment: Nqo1, Gclc, Gstm1, Gpx1, Gpx4, Hmox1, Txnrd1, and Prdx3. Txnip was reciprocally increased in CSE-/- mice and decreased by SG1002 treatment.

R2 retrotransposons insert site-specifically to the multicopy genes encoding 28S ribosomal RNA at a target sequence conserved broadly across eukaryotic evolution. R2 retrotransposons have been detected in many animals, but previous surveys have been limited in scope and methodology. Here, we substantially expand the known distribution of R2 retrotransposons from previously unrepresented or underrepresented taxonomic groups ranging from ctenophores to amphibians and reptiles. We discover diverse R2 domain architectures and motifs and identify many new avian R2 candidates for genome engineering development. Overall, phylogenetic analyses reveal two highly successful R2 lineages. We observe properties of each lineage in several features of the domains that mediate DNA recognition and in co-evolving signatures within the reverse transcriptase domain. Within each of the two lineages, R2 protein sequences do not necessarily preserve the unifying configuration of N-terminal DNA-binding domains implied in the current clade classification scheme. We show that recombinant R2 proteins with distinctive domain architectures and distribution across major animal classes support target-primed reverse transcription with conserved site specificity. Our analysis of the surprisingly varied domain architectures that support target-site specificity informs new R2 classification criteria and provides a greatly expanded foundation for additional structure/function insights about DNA binding selectivity. This expanded perspective on R2 evolution informs approaches for engineering therapeutic gene insertion technologies and offers an opportunity to investigate the conservation and diversification of retrotransposons.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Our long-term goal is to test whether increasing the immunogenicity of BCG will improve vaccine effectiveness while maintaining its proven safety profile. In this study, we leverage a synthetic biology approach to engineer BCG to produce more (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP), a phosphoantigen produced as an intermediate of bacterial--but not host--isoprenoid biosynthesis via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. Importantly, HMBPP strongly activates and expands V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cells, which are unique to higher-order primates and protect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Prior work to engineer BCG to produce specific ligands and antigens has been attempted to some success; however, our strategy exploits a self-nonself recognition mechanism in the host via HMBPP sensing, which has not been attempted before in this way. To inform the design of our recombinant strains, we performed synteny analyses of >63 mycobacterial species, which revealed that isoprenoid biosynthetic genes are not found in gene clusters or operons across all the 356 surveyed genomes. This analysis also revealed pair biases of isoprenoid biosynthesis genes frequently found in close proximity. In our engineering attempts, we found that simply overexpressing the rate-limiting gene in the pathway was toxic to the bacterium. Thus, we generated synthetic loci with the goal of specifically overproducing HMBPP, and tested the ability of these engineered strains to induce human V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cell expansion in an in vitro stimulation assay. We found that BCG expressing a rationally-designed, synthetic MEP locus did not enhance V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cell expansion over the wild-type vaccine strain, suggesting that ectopic expression of multiple MEP genes may result in feedback inhibition of the pathway. However we found that overexpression of the HMBPP synthase GcpE alone potently induced V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cell expansion and did not result in downregulation of other pathway genes, presenting a successful strategy to accumulate HMBPP and overcome feedback inhibition in this pathway. While much remains to be done to ultimately develop a more efficacious vaccine, our data present a promising system to improve upon the BCG platform.

We studied effects of adipocyte Agt or AT1aR deficiency on diet-induced atherosclerosis and AngII-induced AAAs in male low density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr) deficient mice. For atherosclerosis, male control or adipocyte Agt/AT1aR deficient mice were fed Western diet for 3 months.

For AngII-induced AAAs, male control and adipocyte Agt/AT1aR deficient Ldlr-/- mice fed Western diet were infused with AngII. Adipocyte Agt deficiency had no effect on body weight, serum cholesterol concentrations, abdominal aortic lumen diameter, AAA incidence, or atherosclerosis. Control, but not adipocyte AT1aR deficient mice lost weight during AngII infusion. The size of adipocytes in white fat was increased in adipocyte AT1aR deficient mice with no significant influences on abdominal aortic lumen diameter, AAA incidence, or atherosclerosis. To define mechanisms, male Ldlr-/- mice were fed standard or Western diet (1 or 3 months) and Agt or AT1aR mRNA abundance quantified in periaortic fat (PAF). Agt mRNA abundance in abdominal PAF increased over time in both diet groups, with modest diet-induced reductions in thoracic PAF Agt mRNA abundance. There was an effect of diet duration on AT1aR mRNA abundance in thoracic PAF, and an interaction between diet and time on abdominal PAF AT1aR mRNA abundance. In conclusion, adipocyte Agt or AT1aR deficiency had minimal effects on atherosclerosis or AngII-induced AAAs. However, adipocyte AT1aR deficient mice exhibited increased adipocyte size.

These studies assumed that neurons were the primary source of BDNF, but other studies have since demonstrated that microglia can produce BDNF in the brain. Still, it remains unclear if microglial BDNF is important for the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. Our initial studies show that the behavioral and synaptic effects of ketamine are associated with increased Bdnf expression in sorted PFC microglia 24 hours after injection. We then demonstrate that conditional BDNF depletion in microglia (Cx3cr1Cre/+:Bdnffl/fl) reduces GluN2B levels in PFC synaptoneurosomes and attenuates antidepressant-like responses following ketamine treatment compared to genotype controls (Cx3cr1Cre/+:Bdnf+/+).

These findings suggest that in autoimmune diseases like psoriasis, Th9/IL-9 promote atherosclerosis by directly targeting endothelial cells, and that IL-9R/STAT3 signaling could be a promising therapeutic target for ASCVD.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

We propose a hierarchical three-layer model in which a third set of megabase-scale \"super-loops,\" extruded by a small number of high-processivity motors, compacts chromatin to its native dimensions. Polymer simulations of human chromosome 1 (250 Mb) show that 25-200 consecutive or interlaced super-extruders forming ~10 Mb loops are sufficient to collapse a 25m bottle-brush structure into the empirically observed 5-8*1.5m rod. This model simultaneously reproduces the second diagonal in mitotic Hi-C maps, the double-helical scaffold seen in 3D-SIM microscopy, and the alternating-handedness, zero-mean helicity reported by high-resolution imaging. Interlaced super-loops enhance structural robustness against extruder loss and naturally account for the centromere as a region devoid of super-extruders. Although our simulations remain agnostic to molecular identity, we hypothesize that specialized forms of Condensin II, aided by auxiliary chromosome-associated proteins, act as super-extruders, while Topoisomerase II and other cross-linkers stabilize accumulated stress by converting transient DNA crossings into durable catenations. This three-layered mechanism resolves longstanding discrepancies in chromosome size, shape, contact-map profile, and scaffold ultrastructure within a unified physics-based framework. The next step is to identify or distinguish super-extruders experimentally and to design Hi-C, imaging, or mechanical perturbation assays to validate their existence and dynamics.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

We present a methodological platform that enables segment-resolved profiling of mitochondrial respiration, conductance, and membrane potential in freshly isolated mouse nephron segments. Combining mechanical sieving and adhesion-based enrichment with permeabilized high-resolution respirometry, we adapted the creatine kinase clamp to quantify oxygen flux and mitochondrial membrane potential across defined free energies. Using this approach, we found that proximal tubules exhibit high respiratory conductance and dynamic mitochondrial polarization, while distal tubules and glomeruli maintain static membrane potential and low conductance. In a model of adenine-induced nephropathy, only proximal tubule mitochondria showed marked reductions in respiration and ATP production. This segment-specific dysfunction was not detectable in bulk mitochondrial isolates. Our approach provides thermodynamically anchored, segment-resolved insight into mitochondrial adaptation under physiological and pathological conditions. It is broadly applicable to other tissues with metabolic heterogeneity and compatible with disease models, genetic tools, and pharmacological interventions.

An all-in-one eNme2.C-TadA8e/guide 2 plasmid achieved approximately 20% on-target editing in PiZ reporter cells. TadA9e, which has a narrower editing window than TadA8e, reduced bystander editing without significantly affecting the on-target edit. In PiZ transgenic mice, eNme2.C-TadA9e AAV showed approximately 23% editing efficiency after 8 weeks and reduced liver disease burden in treated mice.

Coordinated regulation of this regenerative process is essential for uterine homeostasis and fertility; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) contributed to postpartum endometrial re-epithelialization using PdgfrCreERT2/+; Rosa26-tdTomatofl/+ lineage tracing mice. Flow cytometry revealed a marked increase in mesenchymal-derived (MD) epithelial cells during active tissue repair. Notably, these cells were transient, undergoing clearance primarily via apoptosis following completed epithelial restoration. We also identified a migratory population of transitional cells of mesenchymal origin within the mesometrial stroma that incorporated into the luminal epithelium, consistent with an active MET program. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) revealed that MD epithelial cells exhibited gene expression profiles associated with cell adhesion and cytoskeletal remodeling, while transitional cells were enriched for genes involved in junctional assembly and actin dynamics. MET-associated genes were significantly upregulated in both transitional and MD epithelial populations. Cell-cell communication analysis highlighted WNT, BMP, and EPHA signaling as candidate regulators of MET during regeneration. Together, these findings provide confirmation of MET as a physiologic mechanism of postpartum endometrial epithelial repair and uncover a coordinated signaling network that facilitates this process.

Large spinal motor neurons (SMNs), most susceptible to ALS, exhibit higher flux compared to smaller SMNs and ALS-resistant ocular motor neurons. Notably, large SMNs accelerates both autophagy and proteasome-mediated degradation, which are further augmented by TDP-43 loss. Additionally, acceleration of multiple unfolded protein response pathways indicates their innate tendency to accumulate misfolded proteins. Enhanced cellular degradation in large SMNs is neuroprotective as its inhibition halts axon outgrowth. These findings propose that cell size-associated degradation load underlies selective neuronal vulnerability in ALS, highlighting the alleviation of catabolic stress as a target of therapy and prevention.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Several high-throughput and sensitive immunoassays have been developed to quantify NfL in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), facilitating the use of NfL as a biomarker in research and clinical practice. However, because of the lack of rigorous comparisons of assays, it has been difficult to determine whether data are comparable and whether assay performance differs. Here, we compared the performance of five NfL immunoassays. Methods: To assess the five NfL immunoassays (Fujirebio, ProteinSimple, Quanterix, Roche and Siemens), we used pooled plasma or pooled CSF, as well as unique samples from 20 healthy controls and 20 individuals with El Escorial defined probable or definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to evaluate precision, parallelism and/or bias. We also examined correlations between plasma and CSF NfL concentrations within and across assays and evaluated their ability to differentiate healthy controls from individuals with ALS. Results: Four of the five assays demonstrated exemplary performance based on our analyses of precision and parallelism. Across the five assays, NfL concentrations were lower in plasma than in CSF, although they displayed a high degree of correlation. We noted bias across assays; plasma NfL concentrations were lowest for the Roche assay and highest for the ProteinSimple assay. In addition, all assays reliably distinguished healthy controls from individuals with ALS using plasma or CSF NfL. Conclusions: Four NfL assays demonstrated similar analytic performance. Alongside performance, other factors such as costs, accessibility, useability, footprint, and intended use, should be considered.

J.; Engert, F.", "abstract": "Oxygen availability is a critical environmental variable that shapes animal physiology and behavior. In larval zebrafish, acute hypoxia elicits a distinct increase in rhythmic pectoral fin movements, a behavior thought to facilitate oxygen uptake. While peripheral oxygen sensors such as neuroepithelial cells (NECs) and Merkel-like cells (MLCs) have been well characterized, the motor circuits responsible for executing this behavior remain unknown. Four distinct lower motor nerve branches in the spinal cord have been shown to innervate the pectoral fin muscles and are candidate effectors of hypoxia-induced behaviors. Here, we identify the neural pathways that transform hypoxia detection into a dedicated motor output. Using high-speed behavioral tracking, we confirm that hypoxia reliably increases pectoral fin beat frequency without affecting locomotor tail activity or visually guided swimming. Two-photon calcium imaging in Tg(ChaTa:Gal4;UAS:GCaMP6s) larvae reveals that a subset of cholinergic spinal motor neurons is selectively active during hypoxia-induced fin movements. Targeted laser ablation of pectoral fin motor nerves abolishes the response, demonstrating the necessity of descending input for this behavior. Our findings define a distributed, partially redundant motor circuit that implements a homeostatic fin response to hypoxia. By establishing a mechanistic framework for this behavior in a genetically accessible vertebrate model, this work enables future studies of oxygen sensing, sensorimotor integration, and the neural basis of homeostatic motor control.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Several vaccines have been approved in the past years, the majority are based on the Spike or RBD proteins and employs parenteral administration routes. Considering the recent history of Coronavirus zoonotic events, causing serious human health problems, the generation of vaccines with a broad scope of protection and the potential to cut/reduce the transmission remains in the spotlight. The current global pandemic preparedness initiatives have promoted also the preclinical evaluation of a new group of Coronavirus vaccines. In the present work a nasal vaccine candidate based on two highly conserved Sarbecovirus proteins, S2 and nucleocapsid (N), is evaluated in two different mice strains. The vaccine preparation, containing a CpG ODN as adjuvant, was able to generate high antibody titers against both antigens, in sera and bronchoalveolar lavages. This antibody response results cross-reactive to S2 from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and to N from SARS-CoV-1. However, a very low neutralizing capacity was found in the sera of the immunized mice when a pseudoviral system assay was used. On the other hand, the vaccine preparation induces, at systemic compartment, IFN secretion, and a marked IgG2a response, specific against both proteins; a profile consistent with the development of a Th1 pattern. Although further evaluations should be done, including protection assays, the demonstrated cross-reactivity level and mucosal response constitutes promising features of this vaccine candidate.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Transformation proceeds via the capture of exogenous DNA, its internalisation in single strand form (ssDNA) and its integration into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. While the proteins involved in these steps have mainly been identified, the specific mechanisms at play remain poorly characterised. This study takes advantage of recent advances in structural modelling to explore the uptake of ssDNA during transformation. Using the monoderm human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, we model a tripartite protein complex composed of the transmembrane channel ComEC, and two cytoplasmic ssDNA-binding proteins ComFA and ComFC. Using targeted mutation and transformation assays, we propose that pneumococcal ComEC features a narrow channel for ssDNA passage, and we show this channel is conserved in the diderm Helicobacter pylori. We identify key residues involved in protein-protein and protein-ssDNA interactions in the pneumococcal tripartite complex model and we show them to be crucial for transformation efficiency. Structural modelling reveals that this tripartite protein complex and its interaction with ssDNA are conserved in firmicutes. Overall, this study validates a tripartite complex required for the internalisation of ssDNA during transformation in firmicutes, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in this horizontal gene transfer mechanism central to bacterial adaptation. It also demonstrates the power of recent structural modelling techniques such as AlphaFold3 as hypothesis generators and guides for designing experiments.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Previous work has shown that in the presence of antibiotics, plasmids conferring AMR will spread to a larger number and a more phylogenetically diverse group of host organisms. However, this pattern may be complicated when multiple plasmids confer the same resistance. Here, we analyse host-plasmid networks in experimental communities of three bacterial species cultured for six weeks with three incompatible plasmids (plasmids that cannot stably coexist within a single cell) conferring tetracycline resistance. The communities are cultured either without tetracycline, or with a low or high dose of the antibiotic. We find that while antibiotic selection leads to higher plasmid prevalence, it does not change the structure of host-plasmid networks. Under all conditions, the networks become highly specialised, as specific host-plasmid pairings emerge. This result is supported by a previously published mathematical model parameterised to match our experimental set-up. Our study reiterates the importance of fitness effects of plasmids in determining the structure of bacteria-plasmid networks. The spread of a given AMR plasmid is reduced when fitness differences are reduced due to other plasmids carrying AMR genes, leading to more specialised bacteria-plasmid networks.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Phenotypic drug tolerance, a phenomenon where Mtb populations can temporarily survive therapeutic antibiotic concentrations, represents a significant hurdle to TB treatment and is indeed one of the factors responsible for prolonged TB therapy. Assays that can identify compounds with improved efficacy against drug tolerant Mtb are urgently required to improve TB treatment regimens. Here, we report the development of a 96-well plate assay capable of identifying anti-Mtb drugs with activity against drug tolerant Mtb in physiologically relevant intracellular environments within macrophages. Primary murine macrophages modified either by immunological activation or specific CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockouts to generate tolerance-inducing environments were infected with an Mtb strain constitutively expressing luciferase. Following drug exposure, differences in bacterial survival were measured by bacterial outgrowth after lysis of the host macrophages. By monitoring Mtb luciferase in infected macrophages before, during and after drug treatment, we confirmed earlier observations that host immune stresses trigger induction of drug tolerance. However, while host stresses induced tolerance against some anti-TB compounds, the same host stresses were synergistic with other anti-TB drugs.

Our results reveal that select BA species and metabolites are significantly different between children with CF (cwCF) and healthy controls. There is also a trend towards higher primary cBA and total BA levels for cwCF. Matched bacterial metagenomic analyses showed no change in alpha-diversity between groups in our small cohort, at odds with previous studies, whereas changes in relative abundance of Bacteroides (lower) and E. coli (increased) species is consistent with prior reports.

Our model and experiments reveal that plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas is beneficial to the plasmid carrying it when the plasmid remains in its host. However, CRISPR-Cas is selected against when the plasmid carrying it transfers horizontally, if the competitor plasmid encodes a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system that elicits post-segregational killing.

Although they do not alter their diet, lactating females spend more time in shelter and at lower altitudes in order to reduce thermoregulatory costs.

Bacteriophytochromes (BphPs) can be switched between a red light sensitive Pr state and a far red light-sensitive Pfr state by illumination. In so-called prototypical BphPs, the Pr state functions as the thermally favoured resting state, whereas Pfr is more stable in bathy BphPs. The prototypical DrBphP from Deinococcus radiodurans has been shown to be compatible with different output module types. Even though red light regulated optogenetic tools are available, like the pREDusk system based on the DrBphP photosensory module, far red light modulated variants are still rare. Here, we study the underlying contributors to bathy over prototypical BphP behaviour by way of various chimeric constructs between pREDusk and representative bathy BphPs. We pinpoint shared traits of the otherwise heterogenous subgroup of bathy BphPs, and highlight the importance of the sensor effector linker in light modulation of histidine kinase activity. Informed by these data, we introduce the far red light activated system 'pFREDusk', based on a histidine kinase activity governed by a bathy photosensory module. With this tool, we expand the optogenetic toolbox into wavelengths of increased sample and tissue penetration.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

This is mainly because of the degradation of linear nucleic acids by nucleases in body fluids and the difficulty of maintaining stable 3D structures in complex body fluid environments, which seriously hinders the clinical application of aptamers. This makes circular aptamers, which can resist degradation and are more stable in complex body fluid environments, an attractive option. However, the cyclization process may have a considerable impact on the structure of the original linear aptamer, and blind cyclization may lead to a decrease in its affinity. Here, we developed a new method to guide the cyclization of saxitoxin (STX) aptamers based on molecular computation, and verified the activity of circular aptamers through bioactivity experiments to further verify the authenticity and reliability of our methods. Consistent with the computational analysis, although circularization disrupts the G4 structure, circular aptamer not only has a higher affinity than the linear one but also provides certain protection to mice and greatly prolongs their survival, which proves the accuracy and reliability of the circular structure designed by our computational method. Our findings provide important ideas for better guidance in the design of circular aptamers and demonstrate their great potential in therapeutic applications.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Bone regeneration depends on bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which are highly sensitive to IR that causes DNA damage, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and a shift from osteogenesis to adipogenesis, ultimately leading to bone loss and impaired healing. This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of intracellularly delivered bone-derived nanoparticles (BPs) in mitigating IR-induced BMSCs damage. We found that IR exposure caused significant BMSCs dysfunction, including reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, persistent DNA damage, and a shift toward adipogenic differentiation. Treatment with BPs led to efficient intracellular uptake, improved cell morphology, enhanced proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and preservation of balanced differentiation capacity. Transcriptomic analysis via RNA sequencing revealed that BPs restored key molecular pathways disrupted by IR, particularly those involved in cell cycle regulation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and apoptosis. By reversing these transcriptional impairments, BPs supported genomic stability and the regenerative function of BMSCs. Overall, these findings suggest that BPs effectively counteract IR-induced cellular damage and enhance the regenerative capacity of BMSCs, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for radiation-induced skeletal injuries.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

This is further complicated by difficulties to verify vaccine-induced protection in humans. Although research in animal models, namely mice and non-human primates (NHPs), has begun to close this knowledge gap, discrepancies in the relative importance of biological pathways across species limit the utility of animal model-derived biological insights in humans. To address these challenges, we applied a systems modeling framework, Translatable Components Regression (TransCompR), to identify human blood transcriptional variability which could predict Mtb challenge outcomes in BCG-vaccinated NHPs. These protection-associated pathways included both innate and adaptive immune activation mechanisms, along with signaling via type I interferons and anti-mycobacterial T helper cytokines. We further partially validated the associations between these mechanisms and protection in humans using publicly available microarray data collected from BCG-vaccinated infants who either developed TB or remained healthy during two years of follow-up.

In chronic exposure models, this loss often occurs by extrusion of the HC from the sensory epithelium towards the luminal cavity. HC extrusion is preceded by several steps that begin by detachment and synaptic uncoupling of the cells from the afferent terminals of their postsynaptic vestibular ganglion neurons. To identify gene expression programs driving these responses to chronic ototoxic stress, we performed five RNA-seq control versus treated comparisons involving two species (rat and mouse), two compounds (streptomycin and 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile, IDPN), and three time points in the rat/IDPN model. By comparing the differentially expressed genes and their associated Gene Ontology terms, we identified both common and model-unique expression responses. The earliest and most robust common response was a downregulation of HC-specific genes, including stereocilium (Atp2b2, Xirp2), synaptic (Nsg2), and ion channel genes (Kcnab1, Kcna10), together with new potential biomarkers of HC stress (Vsig10l2). This response was validated by in-situ hybridisation and immunofluorescence analyses. A second common response across species and compounds was the upregulation of the stress mediator Atf3. Model- or time- restricted responses included downregulation of cell-cell adhesion and mitochondrial ATP synthesis genes, and upregulation of interferon response, unfolded protein response and tRNA aminoacylation genes. The present results provide key insights on the responses of the vestibular sensory epithelium to chronic ototoxic stress, potentially relevant to other types of chronic stress.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

To elucidate the impact of the NMNAT2-SARM1 axis on brain energy metabolism, we employed multi-omics approaches to investigate the metabolic effects caused by neuronal NMNAT2 loss. The loss of NMNAT2 in glutamatergic neurons results in a striking metabolic shift in the cerebral cortex from glucose to lipid catabolism, reduced lipid abundance, and pronounced neurodegenerative phenotypes. Proteomic analysis found that neuronal NMNAT2 loss altered levels of glial enzymes central to glucose and lipid metabolism. Genetic deletion of SARM1 in NMNAT2-deficient mice restores lipid metabolism and mitigates neurodegeneration.

Increasing evidence indicates that specific pathways in intermediary metabolism, or their substrate supply, influence lymphocyte differentiation and function. We now show that although stringent restriction of glutamine supply decreases proliferation and differentiation of B cells into plasma cells, glutaminolysis - a major means of metabolism of this amino acid - was only conditionally crucial in B cells and the Ab responses derived from them. Strikingly, Gls, the gene encoding the main glutaminase of lymphocytes, promoted anti-NP Ab responses at the primary and recall phases only when either glucose uptake into B cells or pyruvate into their mitochondria was also impaired. This synthetic auxotrophy involved support to a progressive expansion of mitochondrial respiration followed by plasma cell differentiation. Surprisingly, impairment of glutaminase and the mitochondrial pyruvate channel not only decreased the coupling of IL-21 stimulation to STAT3 induction, but also interferon stimulation of STAT1 activation.

We found taxon-specific metabolic variations, with suspended particles showing up-regulated transcripts from diatoms, haptophytes, and chlorophytes, while sinking particles exhibited those from diatoms, ciliates, and dinoflagellates.

Initial antimicrobial testing in an ion-rich media (ion levels similar to mammalian body fluids) found that the PrAMPs were effective against E. coli but not P. aeruginosa. Both Api88 and Api137 were bactericidal, while Onc72 and Onc112 were bacteriostatic against E. coli. In a lower ion-media the activity of the PrAMPs significantly improved against both bacteria and Onc72 and Onc112 altered the mode of action to bactericidal. In low Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ ion conditions all of the peptides were able to penetrate the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa, however at higher ion concentrations none of the peptides were able to penetrate the outer membrane. PrAMPs were found to cause E. coli cells to swell and have a hyperpolarised membrane indicating a new mechanism of action for PrAMPs. Our data indicates that bacteria reduce susceptibility to AMPs by stabilising their LPS layer with metal ions and that the PrAMPs have secondary modes of action affecting the functionality of the bacterial membrane.

Here we have identified and characterized two essential host-factors for JEV trafficking in neuronal cells: Endophilin & Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). Through quantitative estimation of viral RNA copy number, we demonstrate that JEV entry in neuronal cells, was blocked by knock-down of Endophilin A isoforms, while activation of Endophilin-mediated endocytosis using a specific inhibitor of GSK-3 enhanced virus entry. Deletion mutants of Endophilin showed an essential role of SH3, BAR, H0 domains for virus entry. High resolution fluorescence imaging of virions showed overlap with Endophilin A2 puncta. Virus entry led to rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, and was highly sensitive to any pharmacological actin perturbation. Virus endocytosis activated EGFR, and the specific kinase inhibitors Erlotinib, and Gefitinib, reduced virus entry and replication in cultured cells and mouse primary cortical neurons. Silencing of EGFR, competitive inhibition with receptor ligand EGF, and EGFR specific antibodies significantly impaired JEV binding and entry, indicating the crucial role of its ligand binding domain for virus attachment/receptor interaction.

DelMut were annotated in three independent common bean populations using a previously developed random forest (RF) model incorporating phylogenetic and protein information. Deleterious scores from the RF model were mostly around 0.25, with the top 1% (highly DelMut) of variants scoring between 0.78 0.82 among populations. All populations showed variation in the number of highly DelMut per line (max. 13 197) and in genetic load. We assessed the impact of incorporating a priori information for variant prioritization and weighting based on predicted deleteriousness in GP models for yield and flowering time. Stochastic simulations were conducted to evaluate how different mating schemes based variable numbers of DelMut per parent affect genetic gain. Variants with higher predicted scores had significantly different effect distributions compared to random or lower-scored markers. Yield predictions were 4.4712.3% more accurate when markers were weighted by effect and deleterious score; no consistent improvement was observed for flowering time.

C.; Pertea, M.; Salzberg, S.", "abstract": "Learning, reasoning, and working memory functions are attributed to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a distinctive region of the human brain that is highly evolved in primates and exhibits notable variability among individuals. Environmental and genetic factors likely contribute to this variability, but little is known about how they influence changes within an individual brain across the lifespan as different cognitive tasks and challenges arise. Most genetic studies focus on DNA mutations or changes in overall gene expression levels. However, genes can also alter the form in which they are expressed through alternative splicing. Using RNA sequencing data from prenatal and postnatal human DLPFCs, we observed that many genes undergo dramatic shifts in their isoform preferences around the time of birth. We further found that thousands of genes continue to undergo gradual, temporally regulated changes in their preferred isoforms, a phenomenon we term 'isoswitching'. In this study, we present isoswitching as a major force in brain development, capable of accurately predicting human brain age from prenatal stages through late adulthood and beyond eighty years of age. This represents the first demonstration of brain age prediction based solely on RNA sequencing data. We also report isoswitching in the brain of a closely related primate, the rhesus macaque.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

This heteromeric complex comprises the catalytic subunit DHDDS and the regulatory Nogo-B receptor (NgBR). Although NgBR dramatically enhances DHDDS activity, the molecular basis for this allosteric regulation remains unclear. Here, we combined crystallography, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), molecular dynamics simulations, and network analysis to uncover the structural dynamics and communication pathways within hcis-PT. By solving the apo structure of hcis-PT, we reveal only a localized flexibility at the active site and the NgBR C-terminus. However, HDX-MS demonstrated widespread substrate-induced stabilization, particularly at the NgBR {beta}D-{beta}E loop, highlighting it as an allosteric hub. Functional mutagenesis scanning identified NgBRS249 as critical for enzymatic activity, independent of structural perturbations. Network analysis of MD simulations pinpointed this residue as a central node in inter-subunit communication, with perturbations disrupting downstream allosteric pathways, altering enzymatic activity. Our findings reveal a dynamic regulatory network centered at the inter-subunit interface, wherein specific NgBR residues modulate DHDDS activity through allosteric signaling. This work elucidates a conserved mechanism of subunit coordination in long-chain cis-prenyltransferases and suggests novel avenues for therapeutic targeting of hcis-PT-related disorders.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}
{"title": "RNA Mango-based Sensors for Lead", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.07.652743", "authors": "Biswas, A.; DasGupta, S.", "abstract": "Lead (Pb2+) toxicity poses a serious threat to human health and remains a global concern, therefore, there is a critical need for the development of easy-to-use and cost-effective tools for the rapid monitoring of Pb2+. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of the RNA Mango aptamer as a sensitive and selective sensor for Pb2+. Our findings reveal that trace amounts of Pb2+ induce the formation of the G-quadruplex motif in RNA Mango, which facilitates dye binding and activates fluorescence. A detailed investigation of the fluorescence properties of RNA Mango with three different dyes, TO1-Biotin, TO3-Biotin, and Thioflavin-T, in the presence of Pb2+ shows that RNA Mango has the highest binding affinity for Pb2+ in combination with TO1-Biotin, with a KD value as low as ~100 nM. In the presence of Pb2+, RNA Mango has sub-micromolar affinity for all three dyes, showing the tightest binding to TO1-Biotin (KD ~40 nM). Mango lead sensors detect low nanomolar concentrations of Pb2+ with limits of detection of 2 -16 nM, which are significantly lower than its allowable limit in drinking water. RNA Mango exhibits remarkable selectivity toward Pb2+ and can detect lead in tap water samples. This work reports a new class of simple and inexpensive fluorescence-based sensors for lead and expands the repertoire of RNA-based lead sensors.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

We developed a primary, immune-competent zebrafish model to study uveal melanoma (UM), utilizing choroidal-targeted injection and electroporation of plasmids containing human GNAQQ209L and CRISPR/Cas9 cassettes for tumor suppressor gene deletion. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of genetically identical eye- and skin-derived tumors revealed distinct oncogenic pathways, highlighting the importance of studying melanoma subtypes in their correct anatomical context. Additionally, we identified a population of tfec- and pax3a-expressing melanocyte progenitor cells in mitfa-deficient embryos and adult zebrafish eyes, which were highly susceptible to GNAQ-driven transformation. While previous studies have linked mitfa deficiency to accelerated UM onset, our findings suggest that an expanded progenitor population in mitfa-deficient animals drives this susceptibility. Our study establishes a critical role for MITF-independent melanocyte progenitors in UM pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

E.; Cellini, B.; van Breugel, F.; Nagel, K. I.", "abstract": "External forces shape navigation, but cannot be directly measured by an animal in motion. How the brain integrates multi-modal cues to estimate external forces remains unclear. Here we investigated the representation of multi-modal self-motion cues across columnar inputs to the fly navigation center, known as PFNs. We find that one type integrates optic flow and airflow direction signals with distinct dynamics. We reveal airspeed encoding by a different type. Based on these data, we construct and validate models of how multi-sensory dynamics are encoded across PFNs, allowing us to simulate neural responses during rapid flight maneuvers. Applying a nonlinear observability analysis to these responses, we show that PFN representations during active maneuvers are sufficient to decode the direction of an external force (wind) during free flight. Our work provides evidence that active sensation, combined with multisensory encoding, can allow a compact nervous system to infer a property of the external world that cannot be directly measured by a single sensory system.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

However, the role of circRNAs in Dengue virus (DENV) infection remains unexplored. In this study, circEPSTI1 induction was observed in DENV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma of Dengue patients. circEPSTI1 induction is interferon-dependent, as IRF3-knockout cells completely abolished its induction. circEPSTI1 enhances DENV infection by sponging the expression of hsa-miR-942-5p. The antiviral role of hsa-miR-942-5p is mediated by bidirectional inhibition of conserved genomic sequences of the DENV genome across NS1, NS3 and NS5 and the host AKT1 signaling pathway. circEPSTI1 sponges hsa-miR-942-5p and relieves its inhibition over DENV genomic RNA and the host AKT1 signaling pathway, thus leading to increased AKT1 activation and DENV replication. These findings highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of circEPSTI1 and the novel circEPSTI1-miR-942-5p-AKT1 axis that regulates the host immune response against DENV infection.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Competition is commonly reflected in aggressive interactions among groupmates, as individuals try to attain or maintain higher social ranks that can offer them better access to critical resources. In this study, we investigate the factors that can shift competitive incentives against higher- or lower-ranking groupmates. Using a 25-year long behavioural dataset on five wild groups of the two gorilla species, we show that most aggression is directed from higher- to lower-ranking adult females close in rank, highlighting rank-reinforcement incentives. However, females directed 42% of aggression to higher-ranking females than themselves. Lactating and pregnant females, especially those at the latest stage of pregnancy, targeted groupmates of higher rank than the groupmates that cycling females targeted, suggesting that energetic needs motivate females to risk confrontation with more powerful rivals. Females also targeted groupmates of higher rank with increasing number of males in the group, suggesting that males might buffer female-female aggression risk. Contrarily, they targeted females of lower rank with increasing number of females in the group, potentially because this is a low risk option that females prefer when they have access to a larger pool of competitors to choose from. Our study provides critical insights into the evolution of competitive behaviour, showing that aggression heuristics, the simple rules that animals use to guide their aggressive interactions, are not simply species-specific but also dependent on the conditions that individuals experience.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}

Affective speech is commonly expressed to maximize its emotional impact and its neural decoding in integrated medial limbic circuits of recipients. Here we examined how affective speech, which was live produced by speakers to maximize amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in listeners, can evoke significant intralimbic and cortico-limbic affect decoding mechanisms. Aggressive and joyful affective speech that was produced based on real-time feedback of amygdala-hippocampal couplings in listeners increased intralimbic connectivity as well as activity in auditory cortical nodes as parts of a broader affective sound processing network. Neural time courses in the auditory cortex also correlated with acoustic patterns of adaptive speech indicative of a communicative speaker-listener coupling. Affective speech can thus meaningfully influence limbic circuit synchronizations with a specific significance of the amygdala-hippocampal circuit for affect decoding from auditory signals.", "date": "2025-05-09", "journal": ""}
