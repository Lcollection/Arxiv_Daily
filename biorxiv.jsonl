K.; Carbonetto, P.; He, X.; Zheng, J.; Li, H.", "abstract": "Phenotypic correlations between complex human traits have long been observed based on epidemiological studies. However, the genetic basis and underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we developed a gene-based approach to measure genetic overlap between a pair of traits and to delineate the shared genes/pathways, through three steps: 1) translating SNP-phenotype association profile to gene-phenotype association profile by integrating GWAS with eQTL data using a newly developed algorithm called Sherlock-II; 2) measuring the genetic overlap between a pair of traits by a normalized distance and the associated p value between the two gene-phenotype association profiles; 3) delineating genes/pathways involved. Application of this approach to a set of GWAS data covering 59 human traits detected significant overlap between many known and unexpected pairs of traits; a significant fraction of them are not detectable by SNP based genetic similarity measures. Examples include Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn's disease, and Longevity and Fasting glucose. Functional analysis revealed specific genes/pathways shared by these pairs. For example, Cancer and AD are co-associated with genes involved in hypoxia response and P53/apoptosis pathways, suggesting specific mechanisms underlying the inverse correlation between them. Our approach can detect yet unknown relationships between complex traits and generate mechanistic hypotheses and has the potential to improve diagnosis and treatment by transferring knowledge from one disease to another.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Animals with diet-derived defenses must balance food choices to maintain their defense reservoirs along with other physiological needs. Poison frogs accumulate skin alkaloids from their arthropod diet, but whether they show preference for specific prey remains unexplored. Here, we explore the role of leaf litter prey availability and diet preferences in shaping poison frog chemical defenses along a geographic gradient. We examined skin alkaloid composition, stomach contents and leaf litter ants in aposematic diablito frogs (Oophaga sylvatica) at five sites in northwestern Ecuador, and in sympatric, cryptic Chimbo rocket frogs (Hyloxalus infraguttatus) at one site. We found that differential availability of leaf litter ants influenced alkaloid profiles across diablito populations, and low levels of alkaloids were observed in the sympatric, undefended Chimbo rocket frog. Ants were the primary dietary component of the defended species, while undefended species ate other prey categories including beetles and larvae in addition to ants. A prey selection analysis suggested that defended and undefended frogs both feed on a high proportion of specific small ant genera that naturally contain alkaloids, suggesting that selectivity for toxic prey is not restricted to classically aposematic and highly toxic species. These findings suggest that poison frogs use of feeding resources relative to availability may be an understudied and important selection factor in the evolution of acquired defenses.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Self-organized criticality is a hallmark of complex dynamic systems at phase transitions. Systems that operate at or near criticality have large-scale fluctuations or avalanches, the frequency and duration power of which are best fit with a power law revealing them to be scale-free and fractal, and such power laws are ubiquitous. It is an attractive concept in neuroscience since spiking avalanches are exhibited by neural tissue, and may underpin how minuscule events could scale up to circuits and provide adaptive psychobiological function. Much is yet to be understood about criticality in vivo in the healthy brain and in disorders such as addiction, as drugs may alter the critical state tuning to generate drug seeking and dysphoria. Thus, here a novel toolset was developed to use neural avalanches and their self-similarity, rather than power law fit slope exponents as is canonically done, to quantify criticality in a previously collected high-density electrophysiological in vivo corticostriatal dataset from a mouse model of early cocaine abstinence. During behavioral quiescence, in the prefrontal cortex but not ventral striatum of cocaine-dosed mice, it was found that critical tuning is enhanced compared to drug-free controls. Additionally, an empirical biological demonstration of complexity's theoretical correlation to criticality was shown in drug-free mice, was exponentially enhanced in drug-treated cortex, but was absent in the drug-treated striatum. As shown, quantifying criticality grants experimental support for the critical brain hypothesis and allows for statistical interpretation of inter-subject variability and development of further testable hypotheses in systems neuroscience.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that Nodal signaling functions synergistically with FGF to stimulate the migration of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) during cardiac jogging, the first morphological asymmetry observed in zebrafish heart development. While Nodal directs the asymmetric migration of CPCs, we find FGF signaling to be dispensable for this asymmetry, suggesting that FGF plays a permissive rather than instructive role. We further demonstrate that Nodal signaling induces asymmetries in actin cytoskeletal dynamics that correlate with the directional migration of CPCs, while FGF instead generally promotes the actin cytoskeleton of CPCs. In addition to influencing jogging, FGF and Nodal synergize to ensure proper heart looping. We also provide evidence that FGF contributes to heart looping by promoting the differentiation of the secondary heart field. Together, these findings offer insight into how the spatiotemporal dynamics of signaling pathways regulate the cellular behaviors driving organ morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Human Brain Mapping of Homotopic Functional Affinity", "doi": "10.1101/2024.01.09.574929", "authors": "Chen, L.-Z.; Zuo, X.-N.", "abstract": "Homotopic positions are defined as the two areas with opposite but equal horizonal coordinates in the standard symmetric brain space. Characterizing similarity between two homotopic areas, brain homotopy represents a typical feature of the two hemispheres for both structure and function. Functional homotopy provides important perspectives for understanding neural correlates of cognition and behavior. Despite the decisive role of spatial geometric constraints and homophilic attachment on the human connectome, traditional practices in mapping functional homotopy only considered the temporal correlations of functional timeseries between homotopic areas, but ignored the homophily factors in generative connectivity models. Here, we proposed a novel method for functional homotopy analysis, namely Homotopic Functional Affinity (HFA). This method quantifies the homotopic affinity as the cosine distance of the full-brain functional connectivity profiles or fingerprints between the homotopic areas. HFA captures both geometric constraints (homotopic location) and homophily (affinity) simultaneously. By leveraging the resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Chinese HCP (CHCP), we mapped the 700ms-2mm high spatiotemporal resolution HFA and evaluated its test-retest reliability with linear mixed models, exhibiting generally fair-to-substantial reliable measurements of individual differences in HFA. The lowest HFA observed in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) inspired to perform an edge-detection algorithm on its surface render and derived three clearly differentiable and adjacent TPJ subregions: the anterior TPJ (TPJa), the central TPJ (TPJc), and the posterior TPJ (TPJp). We further validated the HFA for the three TPJ regions through a set of comprehensive analyses, including the delineation of their functional connectivity fingerprints, the meta-analysis of their cognitive functions, and their task-activation correlation. Finally, we linked the cortical HFA map to those multimodal brain maps of gene expression, evolution, myelination, functional hierarchy, and cognitive association. The systematic subregion analysis revealed the complex hemispheric specialization of TPJ in attention, social cognition, and language functions. In general, functional specialization of the TPJ areas was stronger in the left hemisphere. The findings from the task activation correlation were highly consistent with those of the meta-analysis. Notably, there were significant differences in social cognition relevant to the three TPJ areas between HCP and CHCP datasets. Furthermore, the correlation analysis of multimodal brain maps illustrated a close relationship between the HFA map and multimodal brain maps. The consistency of maps derived in distinct analyses demonstrated the feasibility of HFA in further understanding psychological and behavioral mechanisms on neural lateralization from the perspective of hemispheric functional integration and specialization. In summary, the proposed HFA framework provides a reliable and valid functional brain mapping tool, with broad applicability in population neuroscience.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Protein expression levels optimize cell fitness: Too low an expression level of essential proteins will slow growth by compromising essential processes; whereas overexpression slows growth by increasing the metabolic load. This trade-off naively predicts that cells maximize their fitness by sufficiency, expressing just enough of each essential protein for function. We test this prediction in the naturally-competent bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi by characterizing the proliferation dynamics of essential-gene knockouts at a single-cell scale (by imaging) as well as at a genome-wide scale. In these experiments, cells proliferate for multiple generations as target protein levels are diluted from their endogenous levels. This approach facilitates a proteome-scale analysis of the fitness landscape with respect to protein abundance. We find that most essential proteins are subject to a threshold-like fitness landscape: growth is independent of protein abundance above a critical threshold and arrests below that threshold. We have recently analyzed the implications of this landscape for growth robustness. Confirming signature predictions of this model, we find that (i) roughly 70% of essential proteins are overabundant, (ii) overabundance increases as the expression level decreases and (iii) the lowest abundance proteins are in vast excess (>10x) of what is required for growth in the typical cell. These results reveal that robustness plays a fundamental role in determining the expression levels of essential genes and that overabundance is a key mechanism for ensuring robust growth.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

However, their potential remains largely unrealized due to a fundamental limitation: the lack of a scalable online learning system capable of supporting large-scale training of complex brain dynamics over long timescales. Current approaches are either limited to offline learning, impeding long-time task training; constrained by high memory complexity, hindering network scaling; or using oversimplified models, failing to capture complex brain dynamics. Here, we introduce BrainScale, a system that synergizes model universality, computational efficiency, and engineering usability to enable scalable online learning in SNNs. First, BrainScale introduces standard model abstractions to support the training of diverse spiking networks. Second, BrainScale implements an online learning algorithm with linear memory complexity by exploiting intrinsic properties of SNN dynamics. Third, BrainScale provides an online learning compiler that automates the implementation of online learning for any user-defined models. Extensive evaluations across diverse SNN dynamics and computational tasks demonstrate that BrainScale consistently delivers strong training performance while maintaining extremely low memory usage and high computational efficiency. These properties enable the online training of a whole-brain-scale SNN of the Drosophila brain, accurately capturing functional activities across brain regions.

They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages, viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage benefit1-5. One such gene is nblA which is present in multiple cyanophage families2,6-8. Under nutrient deprivation the cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome9-11, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks11, serving as a survival mechanism12. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation9,6. However, the benefit of the cyanophage-encoded NblA for the cyanophage and the broader impact on the host are unknown. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for marine cyanophages14, we reveal that cyanophage NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins and reduces host photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency. Metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and compose 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in the surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of the nblA gene to the cyanophage while exerting a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis.

Here, we employ an alternative approach to estimate the entire connectivity structure by analyzing all time-courses simultaneously. This approach is robust even for short-duration recordings, facilitating faster functional connectome identification and real-time applications. Using resting-state MEG recordings from controls and individuals with tinnitus, we demonstrated that the learned connectomes outperform correlation-based connectomes in fingerprinting, that is, identifying an individual from test-retest acquisitions. Group-level analysis revealed distinct altered FC in tinnitus across multiple frequency bands, affecting the default mode, auditory, visual, and salience networks, suggesting a reorganization of these large-scale networks beyond auditory areas.

Beta-solenoids exist in nature in numerous forms and emerging protein design technologies may afford opportunities to diversify them further, suggesting the possibility of creating a variety of new AFPs by installing a threonine ladder on non-AFP natural or designed beta-solenoids. However, early attempts at such engineering, combined with differences observed between AFPs and structurally similar ice-nucleating proteins, have raised a critical question: Does the specific solenoid scaffold significantly affect a threonine ladder's structural characteristics (and thus its suitability for ice binding)? We set out to address this question by creating distinct variants of a model beta-solenoid for in silico analysis via structure prediction and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings indicate that the concavity of the beta-solenoid face on which a threonine ladder is arrayed can substantially influence the local geometry of the threonines, with less concave examples resembling the AFP TmAFP and a more concave example losing the ordered channel waters present in well-studied natural ice-binding surfaces. Disparities in concavity and threonine hydroxyl spacings appeared initially in our AlphaFold results and were supported by the simulations, illustrating AlphaFold's possible utility for high-throughput preliminary screening of designed beta-solenoid AFP sequence candidates.

Yet, mosquito mating has been historically viewed as male-guided, with the female exerting little control. To understand this contradiction, we investigated initiation of successful mating in mosquitoes. Here we show that females of two invasive mosquito species, the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), actively gate mating through a previously undescribed behavior of female genital tip elongation. This female genital response is triggered by a rapidly-evolving secondary male genital structure that together act as a ''lock-and-key'' mechanism. We identified important differences in the genital interactions of the two species and show that Aedes albopictus males, which have larger secondary male genital structures, can bypass the female genital response of Aedes aegypti females but not of females of their own species. Coupled with previous observations that Aedes aegypti females are effectively sterilized by such cross-species mating, the ability of male Aedes albopictus to ''pick the lock'' of heterospecific females provides a potential mechanism for the observed local extinction of Aedes aegypti when they live in shared territory with Aedes albopictus.

Previous studies suggest that it is associated with reproductive benefits, either by making breeders newly available for reproduction or by increasing offspring care and reducing competition for resources. In addition, infanticide may result from a reproductive trade-off, where parents kill their offspring if environmental conditions compromise their reproductive value. Here, we combine video, genetic and individual-level reproductive data collected over 12 years to describe infanticide in a highly social, cooperative bird, the sociable weaver Philetairus socius and to establish whether direct reproductive benefits or life-history trade-offs are possible motivators for this behaviour. We documented 50 cases of infanticide and identified 27 aggressors with known histories. These were mostly born outside the colonies where they committed infanticide (63%) and there was some bias towards females and younger individuals. Aggressors were usually not part of the victim's breeding group (74%), but in two cases infanticide was committed by the breeding female, and in five by helpers. In most cases, aggressors were not reproducing at the time of the infanticide, never mated with any of the breeders from the attacked nest, nor occupied the nest from where the chicks were evicted. Only eight of the known aggressors were confirmed as breeders after the attacks, and these mostly reproduced at the colony where the attacks were committed. Overall, we found no evidence for direct reproductive benefits of infanticide in sociable weavers. However, the younger age of aggressors, lack of genetic relatedness to the victims and future breeding at the colony suggest that competition between breeding groups, and hence indirect reproductive benefits, could provide motivation for infanticide in this population.

Through extensive retrospective experiments, we demonstrate that PBCNet2.0 intrinsically comprehends protein-ligand interactions, showing high sensitivity to intermolecular interactions and exceptional perception of spatial geometric information. Strikingly, PBCNet2.0 exhibits an emergent capability to predict affinity changes induced by binding residue variations, highlighting its potential for identifying resistance mutation. We prospectively validated these capabilities on ENPP1 and ALDH1B1 targets, where PBCNet2.0 successfully identified affinity shifts arising from subtle molecular interactions and conformational differences, and pinpointed critical binding residues with an 83% hit rate. This combination of computational efficiency, spatial geometric perception of binding site, and generalizable affinity prediction establishes PBCNet2.0 as a transformative tool for developing pharmacological probes for all human proteins.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Previous work reported the emergence of ripples at P10 in the CA1 region, together with the development of inhibition. On the other hand, neither the relationships between perisomatic inhibition and ripples or their developmental emergence have been investigated in CA3, in which ripples have a different frequency profile (90-110Hz instead of 140-200Hz in CA1), functional perisomatic inhibitory circuits have different properties, and some developmental aspects such as neurogenesis or interneuron maturation are early compared to CA1. We have here investigated the hypothesis of a conjoint and earlier appearance and maturation of ripples and perisomatic inhibition in the CA3 hippocampal region compared to CA1. We report a parallel sequence of events in CA3 and CA1, starting with the early expression of perisomatic GABAergic synaptic activity combined with the emergence of ripple activity. Interestingly, perisomatic inhibition and ripple activity follow parallel maturation trajectories, beginning in CA3 at P7 with immature (i.e. unfunctional) inhibition and immature ripples (proto-ripples) with labile oscillatory frequency. Mature functional perisomatic inhibition and clear high-frequency ripple activity progressively emerge between P10 and P12, reaching adult-like properties by P13. A similarly progressive maturation of ripples occurs in CA1, from P11 to P15. The progressive emergence of functional inhibition and specific patterns of neuronal activity likely support the progressive emergence of cognitive function to which they are necessary prerequisite.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

This ancient use of iron oxide does not mean that it has no effect on cells, and especially on macrophages, the cells that maintain pigments particles on site in tattoos. We thus investigated in vitro the delayed/sustained effects of iron oxide pigments on macrophages, i.e. the effects occurring a few days after the exposure to pigments, on pigments-loaded macrophages but in a pigment-free medium, mimicking the status of tattooed skin after all the pigment particles have been captured. By combining proteomic and targeted approaches, we determined that red iron oxide (but not black iron oxide) induces perturbations in mitochondria, altering the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Red iron oxide also induces oxidative stress and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor.

This two-host species is one of the main vectors of the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus. Knowing the phenology of the tick is a prerequisite for a better understanding of its spread and of CCHF virus dispersal. A six-year study was carried out in a horse herd to determine the seasonal variations of H. marginatum infestation. Adult ticks started infesting their hosts from the beginning of March. Infestation peaked during the first weeks of May and then steadily decreased until the end of August. This represented an average annual infestation of more than 300 H. marginatum per horse. Birds are parasitised by H. marginatum immatures (larvae and nymphs) in summer, between mid/late June to the end of September. The larvae are therefore not yet active when the migratory birds pass through in spring. Blackbirds, Turdus merula, were the most infested species: sixty percent of those examined in summer were parasitised by H. marginatum. This bird species could be a good sentinel host for monitoring the establishment of the species in currently H. marginatum-free areas. To complete this multi-year survey, an experimental study was carried out in quasi-natural conditions, with engorged ticks placed in cages in the garrigue. It was shown that the nymphs moulted into adults within 3-4 weeks in July-August. However, they remain completely immobile in the litter, undergoing a behavioural diapause, until the following spring. On the other hand, almost all the nymphs deposited later, in September or October, died during the cold and rainy season. It was also observed that engorged females are able to survive the cold conditions up to 6-8 months before laying eggs. The study also suggested that there were predators of H. marginatum, likely ants and spiders, in the study area. The hosts monitored over all these years were not only infested by H. marginatum. The phenology of other tick species parasitizing horses (Dermacentor marginatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, Rhipicephalus bursa) and birds (Ixodes frontalis, I. ricinus, Hae. punctata) was also highlighted for this study area.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Individuals with the GG genotype are projected to have blue eyes, while individuals with the AA or AG genotypes are projected to have darker eye colours (primarily brown). However, eye colour is a polygenic trait, and previous studies have revealed that a significant proportion of individuals self-report an eye colour that is not concordant with their genotype at rs12913832. Herein, we address the question: What common markers are influencing eye colour in individuals whose self-reported phenotype does not correspond to the expected phenotype based on their rs12913832 genotype? Building upon our prior investigation of iris pigmentation genetics in individuals with an expected \"blue eye\" background (rs12913832:GG genotype) in a sample of the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrows Health (CanPath) cohort, this study extends the analysis to include individuals with an expected \"brown eye\" background (rs12913832:AA+AG). We identified variants in SLC45A2, TYRP1, TYR, SLC24A4 and TSPAN10, which may influence eye colour presentation in individuals with the rs12913832:GG genotype and variants in IRF4, TYRP1 and OCA2, which may influence eye colour presentation in individuals with the rs12913832:AA+AG genotype. These markers include well-known pigmentation-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as rs16891982 (SLC45A2), rs1126809 (TYR), rs12203592 (IRF4), rs1800407 (OCA2) and rs6420484 (TSPAN10). Several of these loci were replicated using independent quantitative eye colour measures, including heterochromia and CIELAB colour dimensions.

For example, even simple 2D shapes with varying contours have been shown to evoke vivid impressions of different materials (Pinna & Deiana, 2015). However, such static representations capture only a single moment in time. When a material moves, its contours shift, evolve, or deform over time, creating contour motion. Does this contour motion convey diagnostic information about material properties, independent of surface appearance? Existing studies on the role of dynamic cues in material perception either use fully rendered 3D stimuli, where contour motion is confounded with rich surface information, or motion-only displays (dynamic dot stimuli or noise patches), which eliminate surface cues but also lack clearly defined contours. As a result, the relative contribution of contour motion to material perception remains unclear. To address this gap, we measured how human observers perceive materials from dynamic line drawings (\"line\"), compared to animations of fully textured stimuli that carry optical and motion information (\"full\"), as well as dynamic dot stimuli (\"dot\"). Stimuli were rendered versions (full, dot, line) of material animations from five material categories (jelly, liquid, smoke, fabric, and rigid-breakable). In one experiment, participants rated five material attributes (dense, flexible, wobbly, fluid, airy motion), and in a second experiment, participants were asked to choose one of the two materials that is more similar to a third material across all possible combinations. Results from both experiments consistently reveal that 1) Dynamic line drawings vividly convey mechanical material properties, and 2) the similarity in material judgments between line and full conditions was larger than that between dot and full conditions. We conclude that contour motion carries rich information about mechanical material qualities.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Common and rare disease-associated variants mapping to alternative transcripts can lead to amino acid substitutions predicted to be structurally damaging in the corresponding protein isoform. The alternative transcripts to which disease-associated variants map demonstrate high tissue-specific expression, with many unannotated in reference human genomes, revealed only by long-read RNA-sequencing. As an example, we report an unannotated alternative transcript of the inflammasome regulator DPP9 that is lung epithelium-specific and which harbours a common genetic variant associated with severe COVID-19 and lung fibrosis. The variant causes a p.Leu8Pro missense mutation in an alternative first exon, predicted to disrupt the encoded alpha helix.

The tumour microenvironment critically shapes ICI responsiveness by modulating antitumour immunity, necessitating a deeper understanding of spatially organised cell-cell interactions. Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables such analysis at single-cell resolution. We present GraphTME, a spatially informed and biologically interpretable framework that models pathway-specific directional cell-cell interactions to predict anti-PD-1 response. Ligand-receptor interactions are organised by signalling pathways and represented as a multi-relational directed graph, with edge weights inversely scaled by spatial distance. Using CD8+ T cells from single-cell RNA-seq data of ICI-treated NSCLC patients, we trained a relational graph convolutional network to infer immune responsiveness. GraphTME achieved an F1 score exceeding 0.83 in predicting ICI response and was validated using MERFISH data from an NSCLC patient with a partial response. Predicted responder CD8+ T cells exhibited higher abundance and stronger directional signalling to tumour cells. They also expressed genes associated with antitumour activity, while non-responders showed expression patterns linked to poor prognosis. GraphTME is the first framework to quantitatively model single-cell-level interactions within the spatial architecture of tumour tissues and predict ICI responses from these interactions. It offers a spatially resolved, biologically grounded biomarker for immunotherapy and a tool for dissecting immune dynamics in situ.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

It was found to be non-toxic for bees, stable and easy to use. Importantly, it does not leave any residues in honey produced. This study investigated how supplementation with few milligrams of this complex can improve hive performance at early spring and reduce winter mortality. Over a two-year field campaign, 283 beehives spread over 6 apiaries located in Spain, Greece and France were involved: 142 beehives supplemented with the molybdenum-based compound and 141 beehives as a control group. Supplementation resulted in a significant reduction in winter colony losses, averaging a 44% decrease, ranging between 27% and 75% in the different apiaries. The risk of death was twice lower in the Na-Mo2O4-EDTA group compared to the control group (risk ratio: 0.51). The impact on bee populations and honey production was also evaluated. A significant increase in honey reserves within the brood area of 107% was observed in the Greek apiary, whereas no comparable effect was detected in Spain, suggesting that local environmental conditions or management practices may influence this parameter.

Mouse studies have established a causal role of CH in atherosclerosis progression and have defined macrophage inflammatory responses as a key underlying mechanism. We undertook the present study to assess the hypothesis that ongoing inflammation would impede atherosclerosis regression in Jak2V617F (Jak2VF) CH mice. Methods and Results - Chimeric Jak2VF/WT or control WT/WT bone marrow was transplanted into Ldlr-/- mice and, following 13-16 weeks of Western diet-induced atherosclerosis progression, cholesterol was lowered either moderately (to 200-300 mg/dl) or markedly (to 100 mg/dl). With moderate cholesterol lowering there was impaired regression in Jak2VF CH mice compared to controls. However, with marked cholesterol lowering, regression was similar in Jak2VF CH and control mice. Two mechanisms of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering-induced suppression of inflammation in plaques were implicated: 1) reversal of increased proliferation, DNA damage and Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome activation specifically in Jak2VF macrophages and 2) markedly increased macrophage triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), c-myc expressing macrophages in both Jak2VF and control mice. Conclusions - Aggressive LDL lowering reverses inflammasome activation and induces pro-resolving changes in macrophages in Jak2VF CH, halting atherosclerosis progression and promoting features of plaque stabilization. These findings suggest that aggressive LDL cholesterol lowering could effectively reverse ACVD risk in individuals with JAK2VF clonal hematopoiesis.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Inhibiting lactate transport further revealed a critical metabolic coupling between Sertoli and germ cells during early testis development. Surprisingly, external lactate or glucose supplementation failed to rescue the germ cell phenotype.

Interestingly, some blueberry cultivars also produce monotropein, which has bioactive properties, including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. However, methods to quantify monotropein in blueberries have not been optimized. To address this gap, an optimized analytical method for monotropein extraction and quantification using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was developed. Different extraction strategies were compared, including variations in temperature, time, and ultrasonication treatments. Optimal extraction was achieved by heating samples to 60{degrees}C for 15 minutes in methanol. The method had high percent recovery (89-110% intraday; 91-108% interday) and good repeatability (1.17-2.15% relative standard deviation (RSD) intraday; 4.68-7.16% RSD interday). This protocol was then applied to 28 blueberry cultivars, 14 of which had not been previously analyzed for monotropein. Monotropein ranged from 0-1807 ng/mg dry weight. The developed method provides a robust tool that can be applied to future evaluations of monotropein in diverse blueberry cultivars.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

However, when cultured in vitro, hDPCs progressively lose their hair-inductive capacity. This decline may be closely associated with the absence of the native microenvironmental niche, which plays a critical role in maintaining hDPC identity and function in vivo. In addition to extrinsic cues, autocrine signaling within the dermal papilla itself may serve as a key mechanism for sustaining its regenerative potential. In this study, we present a novel growth model that enables real-time tracking of hDPC functional recovery, with particular attention to autocrine signaling and niche reprogramming. Our results reveal that intrinsic feedback loops are essential for maintaining hDPC function during the anagen phase. By elucidating the dynamic interplay between hDPC expansion and hair-inductive capacity, this work advances our understanding of hair follicle biology and highlights new avenues for developing regenerative therapies for hair loss.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Precise estimation of circulating tumor fraction is crucial for evaluating treatment effects and timely detection of disease recurrence. All current ctDNA detection methods that utilize whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data rely on the reference genome alignment of sequencing reads and often apply separate tools for detecting different variant types. However, various bioinformatic analysis confounders and the application of external variant calling tools could be avoided by analyzing k-mers from unaligned sequencing reads. While k-mer-based methods have successfully been applied for somatic variant validation and detection, the potential of k-mer-based ctDNA detection is unexplored. We have developed a tumor-informed reference-free ctDNA detection tool called ctDNAmer that detects tumor-specific somatic variation directly from unaligned sequencing data by identifying k-mers unique to the tumor DNA. ctDNAmer detects variant information across the genome by comparing the primary tumor and germline WGS data and accounts for sample-specific germline variability and technical noise in the same framework. We tested the utility of ctDNAmer for tumor fraction estimation on postoperative plasma cfDNA WGS data (mean sequencing depth ~28x) from 90 stage III colorectal cancer patients with three years of follow-up. The tumor fraction (TF) estimates agreed with the available clinical information and ctDNA was detected in 77% (17/22) of recurring patients with a median lead time of 8 months compared to radiological imaging. We further validated ctDNAmers tumor fraction estimates based on a comparison with the mean cfDNA allele frequencies of somatic clonal SNVs identified from aligned primary tumor sequencing data. The TF estimates showed a strong Pearson correlation of 0.897 with the mean allele frequencies and improved ctDNA detection results across samples with an AUC of 0.79 compared to 0.75 if the mean allele frequency of clonal mutations is used.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Identifying phylogenetically informative sites in multiple sequence alignments is critical for accurate tree reconstruction and efficient data curation in phylogenomics. Existing approaches often rely on predefined topologies or heuristic criteria, limiting their generality and interpretability. Here, we introduce a novel, topology-agnostic framework for quantifying site-wise phylogenetic information using sparse learning via Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression. By modeling site log-likelihoods as predictors of tree likelihood across a large ensemble of random topologies, our approach isolates the minimal subset of sites that meaningfully contribute to phylogenetic signal. We validate the method using both simulated and empirical mammalian datasets, demonstrating that Lasso-selected sites yield topologies nearly identical to those inferred from full alignments. Furthermore, we show that a simple entropy-based proxy approximates Lasso results with high fidelity, enabling rapid site-level assessments. Compared to commonly used filtering tools, our method yields more concise alignments with equivalent or superior phylogenetic resolution. These findings establish sparse learning as a principled, scalable, and practical approach for evaluating and optimizing phylogenetic data.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Yet the molecular features underlying this diversity and their roles in tumour progression are not yet fully elucidated. Within a primary tumour, certain clones possess a unique capacity to metastasize to distant organs, such as the brain, and this propensity may be associated with specific gene expression profiles. To investigate this phenomenon, we developed a new optical barcoding library, LeGO-Teknik, compatible with high resolution imaging, flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing and machine learning computational methods. Using this new tool, we systematically assessed the fitness and organ tropism of multiple human breast cancer clones in spontaneous metastasis assays. Linking transcriptomic profiles of individual cancer cells to their clonal identities and metastatic behaviours, we identified that clones predisposed to forming brain metastases exhibit distinct molecular signatures. Notably, individual cells from these clones showed enriched expression of neurogenesis-related genes. Using SCENIC transcription factor analysis, we found that some of these features are driven by the transcription factor SOX4. This hallmark, likely due to a process of cellular reprogramming, is a remarkable example of organ mimicry during clonal selection. Together, this work provides critical insights into brain metastasis and highlights the potential for identifying predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for metastatic breast cancer.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

NADK is post-translationally S-palmitoylated on three cysteine residues (Cys22, Cys23, and Cys26) within the amino-terminal domain by the protein-acyl transferase ZDHHC5, which stimulates NADK activity. Fatty acids activate NADK by enhancing its palmitoylation and relief of an autoinhibitory function inherent to its amino terminus. Furthermore, ZDHHC5-/- mice showed defect in NADK palmitoylation and NADP+ production. Clinically, elevated expression of ZDHHC5 in pancreatic cancer patients was associated with increased NADK palmitoylation and correlated with poor prognoses for patients.

While there is consistency in the general location of text-selective responses - within the posterior portion of the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS) - there is also substantial variability across individuals in the size and precise anatomical location. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate over the extent to which the VWFA a) encodes the visual features of text, versus b) is driven by the task of reading. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned adults and children as they completed two tasks while viewing text, pseudo fonts, faces, objects, limbs. Experimental tasks were: (1) a fixation task where they were instructed to ignore the stimuli while making psychophysical judgements on the fixation dot; (2) a one-back task where they were instructed to attend to the stimuli and detect repeats. We found that a consistent VWFA location could be identified on each individual's cortical surface using either task. At the same time, the response to text during the one-back task evoked a larger territory of text-selective response (leading to a larger ROI) than the fixation task. However, when averaged in template space, text-selective cortex could not be identified due to variability in the relative locations of text-, face-, object-, and limb-selective cortex. Thus, for both children and adults, a text-selective region (i.e., VWFA) can be localized on the individual cortical surface. This resulting region consistently responds to text irrespective of cognitive task, but text-selective responses are masked when averaged in template space due to variability in the exact configuration of category-selective regions.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

But how those dynamics are related to a code defining working memory (WM) performance is not known. Recent data shows brief bursts of activity in the high gamma (70-140 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) band within non-human primate lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with WM processing. However, WM may be related to activity within a network of frontal executive and posterior sensory areas involved in stimulus perception. Here we tested whether gamma and beta bursting exist in lateral PFC and multisensory lateral temporal areas in humans during visual WM, and whether these areas are coupled via a phase-burst code. We used intracranial macroelectrode recordings from the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), which includes dorsolateral PFC, and from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), an area important for visual processing. High gamma bursting increased in human left PFC during encoding and delay periods while beta bursting decreased. Interestingly, beta bursting increased in multisensory areas during encoding and remained high during the delay period, more so on the right. These effects varied with WM performance. Finally, we quantify the degree to which delay-period gamma bursting is locked to beta phase within and between regions of this network using a proposed metric termed phase-burst coupling (PBC). We find evidence that delay-period gamma bursting in temporal areas is locked to beta phase in PFC. Our findings suggest that WM may use bursting to support memory maintenance until readout.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Fast inhibitory signalling is mediated by type A GABA receptors (GABAARs), which form pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. While GABA is also present in plants and prokaryotes, it is unknown when it was first used for fast neuronal transmission. Cnidaria represent a sister group to all Bilateria and possess a variety of putative GABAARs, none of which has been functionally characterized. In this study, we surveyed putative inhibitory ion channel receptors from the model cnidarians Nematostella and Hydra. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a surprising complexity of these receptors. The majority formed a cnidarian-specific radiation with some receptors forming a basal clade. We functionally analyzed seven putative Nematostella GABAARs of this radiation and found that none was activated by GABA or glycine, whereas three were activated by glutamate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a lysine residue in the canonical ligand-binding pocket that is important for activation by glutamate. Our results identified a group of inhibitory ion channel receptors in Cnidaria that uses glutamate as a ligand. Moreover, they suggest that inhibitory ion channel receptors in Cnidaria massively diversified, which may have been instrumental in the evolution of complex behaviors and sensory processing by the cnidarian nervous system.

However, our individual-level EEG functional connectivity analysis challenges this notion. We investigated the impact of cognitive training on functional brain connectivity using task-switching paradigms in 39 younger (18-25 years) and 40 older (60-75 years) women. Participants were randomly assigned to either a training group, which completed eight individualized one-hour cognitive training sessions, or a no-contact control group. EEG was recorded at both pre- and post-training sessions across three task-switching paradigms (trained and near-transfer versions). Unique functional connectivity of different sources of variation was examined by calculating how much variance was shared across stable traits (e.g., individual, age, and common factors), or dynamic states (e.g., task and training effects). Our results revealed that age accounted for only a modest proportion of variance, whereas self-similarity was a dominant factor - particularly in older adults. Similarly, group-level training effects were small but strongly modulated by individual neural profiles, suggesting person-specific trajectories. Participants recruited distinct neural networks across tasks, and even within the same task engaged unique, individual-specific network configurations, reflecting personalised brain adaptations to cognitive demands. Importantly, older adults displayed a shift from common to individual network patterns, consistent with increased neural specialization and compensatory mechanisms. These findings underscore the importance of moving beyond group-level contrasts toward models that capture the complexity of individual brain dynamics in cognitive aging and training responsiveness.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

In contrast, SRSF12 is more highly expressed in primates where it is predominantly transcribed in the testes, oocytes, and brain. SRSF12 co-localizes with other splicing components to nuclear speckles and interacts with core splicing factors in cultured human cells. Strikingly, ectopic expression of SRSF12 in human cells induces widespread transcriptional changes, activating meiosis-, testis- and brain-specific genes. SRSF12 overexpression also leads to mitotic arrest and cell death, phenotypes that require both its structured RNA recognition motif and intrinsically disordered arginine/serine-rich C-terminal domain.

Post-disturbance recovery time is critical for identifying vulnerable areas and targeting conservation but varies with environmental conditions. Monitoring recovery at scale requires tracking tree dynamics, yet traditional ground-based approaches are resource-intensive. We present a pipeline to parameterise integral projection models (IPMs) using LiDAR and hyperspectral data to assess post-fire recovery across large, forested areas. Focusing on the fire-adapted Picea mariana, we model passage times to reproductive heights and life expectancy under different fire regimes as indicators of recovery. To do this, we combined hyperspectral-derived species maps and LiDAR-based crown heights to track individual tree survival and growth at the Caribou-Poker Creek Research Watershed (BONA) from 2017 to 2023. We incorporated fire history, aspect, slope, elevation, and surrounding canopy height into our models and found partial support for their expected effects on survival and growth. Once accounting for topography and competition, we estimated passage times to reproductive maturity (20-677 years), sometimes exceeding historical fire return intervals at BONA (>100-150 years). Life expectancy in the absence of fire is shortest on North-facing slopes with recent fire (579 years). Sensitivity analyses highlight fire history and aspect as key modulators of population resilience, with elevation exerting strong influence on life expectancy across all conditions. Our results demonstrate that remotely sensed IPMs can effectively quantify forest recovery at scale, revealing that in some contexts, stands of P. mariana may not recover between fire disturbances. We also show how the uncertainty and variation around the mean growth rate contributes to longer estimates of passage time. We discuss the implications of these findings for resilience-based forest management and highlight both the challenges and opportunities of using LiDAR and hyperspectral data to build demographic models for forecasting forest dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Theory suggests that indiscriminate mating strategies can be selected if sexes are not completely distinguishable---that is, without strong signals of sexual identity. We model the coevolution of sexual signaling and discrimination using the adaptive dynamics approach to long-term trait evolution. Our model relaxes two major assumptions from past phenomenological theory. First, we consider a mechanistic mating process with tunable encounter rates and mating costs. Second, we vary reproductive investment roles to allow for better correspondence with empirical examples of SSB. We confirm that coevolution of sexual signaling and discrimination can lead to two distinct equilibria: one with no sexual signals and indiscriminate mating; the other with perfect signaling and exclusively different-sex sexual behavior. Selection for indiscriminate mating is strongest at very low or very high encounter rates. Mating costs lead to selection for reduced overall mating rate, but this can lead to either more or less SSB, depending on how this reduction is achieved. Overall, our model highlights the importance of ecologically relevant parameters for the evolution of SSB.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

This work examined SHG imaging in quantifying OS-specific collagen (type I) signatures - focused on fibre length-based parameters - across clinical biopsies. We describe a novel SHG analysis workflow, following systematic optimisation of image resolution and field of view (FOV) size to enable robust quantification of collagen fibre-length metrics in human bone and OS.

The purpose of this study was to explore the role of UBR-box E3 ubiquitin ligases under enhanced protein synthesis and skeletal muscle growth conditions. Cohorts of adult male mice were electroporated with constitutively active Akt (Akt-CA) or UBR5 RNAi constructs with a rapamycin diet intervention for 7 and 30 days, respectively. In addition, the UBR-box family was studied during the regrowth phase post nerve crush induced inactivity. Skeletal muscle growth with Akt-CA or regrowth following inactivity increased protein abundance of UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, UBR5 and UBR7. This occurred with corresponding increases in Akt-mTORC1/S6K and MAPK/p90RSK signaling and protein synthesis. The increases in UBR-box E3s, ubiquitination, and proteasomal activity occurred independently of mTORC1 activity and were associated with increases in markers related to autophagy, ER-stress, and protein quality control pathways. Finally, while UBR5 knockdown (KD) evokes atrophy, it occurs together with hyperactivation of mTORC1 and protein synthesis. In UBR5 KD muscles, we identified an increase in protein abundance for UBR2, UBR4 and UBR7, which may highlight a compensatory response to maintain proteome integrity.

Conclusion: The cryopreservation of embryos is an important advance that will facilitate the biobanking, sharing and long-term preservation of diverse genetic lines. This method may also eventually prove useful for cryopreservation of embryos of other marine invertebrates.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Such effects may be compounded by seasonal variation in resources and reproduction and differ among members of a host community, yet the combined effects of habitat, season, and species identity on wildlife immunity remain poorly understood. We tested within- and across-species effects of land conversion and seasonality on immunity in Neotropical bats by quantifying hematological markers of physiological stress and inflammation. We sampled seven species across a large forest preserve and smaller nearby forest fragment in northern Belize during the dry and wet seasons. Using phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models, we tested overall effects of habitat and season and quantified per-species impacts. Total leukocyte counts and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios showed no overall habitat or seasonal effects but had strong species-specific responses to these predictors. In contrast, the systemic inflammation response index was higher across species in the dry season and in the smaller fragment, suggesting poor health in unfavorable conditions. Species-specific effects did not align with diet guilds, indicating potential roles for finer-scale ecological traits.

R.", "abstract": "Hypertension drives heterogeneous aortic remodeling, but the mechanisms underlying regional disparities remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adaptive immunity orchestrates spatial differences in vascular dysfunction by modulating perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) phenotype and immune-metabolic crosstalk. Using angiotensin II (AngII)-infused wild-type (WT) and Rag1-/- mice lacking T and B cells, we integrated biaxial mechanical testing, bulk transcriptomics, and PVAT analyses. In WT mice, AngII induced pronounced descending thoracic aorta (DTA) remodeling, marked by wall thickening, reduced circumferential stiffness and inflammatory gene upregulation (Il6, Ccl2). These changes were attenuated in Rag1?/? mice, implicating T cells in thoracic maladaptation. Conversely, the infrarenal abdominal aorta (IAA) exhibited hypertensive resilience in WT mice but unmasked PPAR{gamma}-associated metabolic reprogramming (Pparg, Adipoq) in Rag1-/- mice, suggesting T cells suppress protective abdominal adaptations. PVAT heterogeneity emerged as a key regulator wherein thoracic PVAT (T-PVAT) adopted a pro-inflammatory phenotype (CCL5, TIMP-1) in WT mice, exacerbating DTA damage, while Rag1-/- mice showed thermogenic plasticity (Ucp1 upregulation) in abdominal PVAT (A-PVAT). T cell reconstitution restored maladaptive remodeling in Rag1-/- mice, confirming adaptive immunity's dual role in promoting thoracic injury and restraining metabolic resilience. This work identifies PVAT as an immune-metabolic switch governing regional susceptibility to vascular remodeling, offering spatially resolved strategies to preserve aortic compliance in hypertensive disease.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Although FHFs are best characterized as regulators of voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gating, recent studies suggest broader, non-VGSC-related functions, including regulation of Cx43 gap junctions and/or hemichannels, mechanisms that have generally been understudied or disregarded. Methods: We assessed cardiac conduction and cardiomyocyte action potentials in mice with constitutive cardiac-specific Fgf13 ablation (cFgf13KO) while targeting Cx43 gap junctions and hemichannels pharmacologically. Using immunostaining and biochemistry, we characterized FGF13 regulation of Cx43 abundance and subcellular distribution. With proximity labeling proteomics, we investigated novel candidate mechanisms underlying FGF13 regulation of Cx43. Results: FGF13 ablation prolonged the QRS and QT intervals on the surface electrocardiogram. Carbenoxolone, a Cx43 gap junction uncoupler, markedly prolonged the QRS duration leading to conduction system block in cFgf13KO but not in WT mice. Optical mapping revealed markedly decreased conduction velocity (CV) during ventricular pacing. Microscopy revealed markedly perturbed trafficking of Cx43, reduced localization in the intercalated disc, and suggested decreased membrane Cx43 but increased Cx43 hemichannels in cardiomyocytes from cFgf13KO mice. Resting membrane potential (RMP) was depolarized and APD50 was prolonged in cFgf13KO cardiomyocytes. Both were restored towards wildtype (WT) values with Gap19 (a Cx43 hemichannel inhibitor), expression of FGF13, or expression of a mutant FGF13 incapable of binding to VGSCs, emphasizing VGSC-independent regulation by FGF13. To assess the functional impact of RMP depolarization, hearts were subjected to hypokalemia, which had no effect in WT hearts but fully rescued CV in cFgf13KO hearts. Proteomic analyses revealed candidate roles for FGF13 in the regulation of vesicular-mediated transport. Biochemistry and immunocytochemistry showed that FGF13 ablation destabilized microtubules and reduced the expression of tubulins and MAP4, the major cardiac microtubule regulator. Conclusions: FGF13 regulates microtubule-dependent trafficking and targeting of Cx43, thereby impacting cardiac impulse propagation via VGSC-independent mechanisms.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Neural variability poses a major challenge to understanding the information content of neural codes. Recent work by Goris et al. (Nat. Neurosci 2014) has provided new insights into variability in the visual pathway by partitioning it into two components: a stimulus component reflecting sensory tuning, and a modulatory component arising from stimulus-independent fluctuations in excitability. However, a key limitation of this framework is that it lacks a continuous-time interpretation; it applies only to spike counts measured in time bins of a given size, and does not generalize to different bin sizes. Here we overcome this limitation using a new model for continuous-time partitioning of neural variability, the \"continuous modulated Poisson'' (CMP). This model extends the partitioning model of Goris et al. (Nat. Neurosci 2014) by modeling a neuron's instantaneous firing rate as the product of a time-varying stimulus drive and a continuous-time stochastic gain process. We apply this model to spike responses from four different visual areas (LGN, V1, V2, and MT) and show that it accurately captures spike train variability across timescales and throughout the visual hierarchy. Moreover, we demonstrate that the modulatory gain process decays according to an exponentiated power law, with higher variance and slower decay at later stages of the visual hierarchy. This model provides new insights into the organization of both stimulus-driven and stimulus-independent modulatory processes and provides a powerful framework for characterizing neural variability across brain regions.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) augment the activation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and promote neointimal hyperplasia evoked by arterial injury or atherogenesis. We have previously shown that small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) from the Rpl13a locus are key regulators of cellular ROS levels. METHODS: Using mice deficient in the Rpl13a snoRNAs, we tested whether these snoRNAs regulate SMC activation in vitro and in vivo. Carotid endothelial denudation was used to provoke neointimal hyperplasia in wild-type (WT) and snoRNA knockout (snoKO) mice, which lack all four intronically-encoded Rpl13a snoRNAs. Primary SMCs from WT and snoKO mice were used for in vitro functional and proteomic analyses. HEK293T cells with specific snoRNA deletions were used to test for snoRNA-guided 2'-O-methylation of mRNA. RESULTS: Arterial ROS levels, inflammation, and carotid artery neointimal hyperplasia were reduced in snoKO compared with WT mice. In vitro, snoKO SMCs demonstrated lower ROS levels and less migration, proliferation, and inflammatory signaling than WT SMCs. Reduced ROS levels in snoKO SMCs and aortas correlated with upregulation of the mitochondrial protein COX4I2, which is associated with reduced mitochondrial ROS under normoxic conditions. Deleting the snoRNA U32A in human HEK293T cells decreased 2'-O-methylation of COX4I2 mRNA and upregulated COX4I2 protein without changing COX4I2 mRNA levels. Silencing Cox4i2 in snoKO SMCs upregulated SMC ROS to WT levels. CONCLUSIONS: Rpl13a snoRNAs are important drivers of SMC activation and neointimal hyperplasia. Rpl13a snoRNAs augment SMC ROS levels, at least in part, by post-transcriptional downregulation of COX4I2 expression.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

We successfully produced homozygous mutant honey bee workers by crossing individuals mutated with CRISPR/Cas9 targeting mKast. Through behavioral analyses of mKast mutants using a new conditioning paradigm and a visual response assay, we found that mKast functions in bimodal learning and memory based on olfactory and visual information, and direction-specific motion sensing.

NeoPrecis features an interpretable T-cell recognition model that reveals the critical influence of MHC molecules on TCR recognition beyond mere antigen presentation. Benefit HLA alleles identified through model-driven contribution analysis exhibit significant predictive power for patient outcomes in immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment (melanoma: p-value = 0.04; NSCLC: p-value = 0.01).

While the role of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) in GBM is established, the function of its brain-enriched isoform, SCD5, remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that SCD5 is essential for glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) maintenance and genomic stability, with elevated expression in GSCs that declines upon differentiation, underscoring its role in tumor initiation. Through shotgun lipidomics, 13C metabolic flux analysis, and functional genomics, we reveal that SCD1 and SCD5 play non-redundant roles in fatty acid desaturation, with SCD5 preferentially desaturating C18:0 and uniquely contributing to sphingolipid remodeling. Genetic silencing of either isoform disrupts cell cycle progression, impairs DNA damage repair, and reduces GSC viability, while SCD5 knockdown significantly extends survival in orthotopic GBM models. Mechanistically, loss of SCD activity or saturated fatty acid accumulation triggers PARP1 hyperactivation and subsequent degradation, depleting RAD51 to compromise homologous recombination and induce parthanatos. These findings uncover a lipid-mediated vulnerability in GBM, linking fatty acid desaturation to PARP1-dependent genome integrity.

This research focused on two Assyrtiko clones--A16 and E11--grown in the Nemea, Peloponnese, which displayed distinct aromatic traits.

Further, NREM twitches co-occur with sleep spindles, suggesting a unique functional role. Given that NREM sleep is composed of distinct substages, we investigated whether twitching and twitch-spindle coupling are differentially expressed during N2 and N3 sleep. In 6-month-old human infants (n=21; 7 females), we recorded EEG, respiration, and video during daytime sleep. We found that the high intensity of twitching during N2 resembled REM more than N3.

Also, despite differences in the intensity of twitching during N2 and N3, significant twitch-spindle coupling occurred in both stages. Finally, twitch rate was inversely related to delta power across NREM periods. These findings suggest that although twitching occurs during REM, N2, and N3 sleep at this age, its expression is compatible with some sleep components (e.g., rapid eye movements, sleep spindles) but not others (e.g., cortical delta), highlighting the continuing need to better understand the dynamic organization of sleep and its individual components in early development.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

The balance between commensalism and pathogenicity is complex and depends on factors including host and fungal genetic background, the host environment, and fungal interactions with local microbes. The major interaction interface of C. albicans with the host is its multilayered cell wall, which is dynamic and highly responsive to the surrounding environment. Therefore, factors that influence the fungal cell wall will directly impact C. albicans-host interactions. Our work demonstrates that multiple physiologically-relevant gastrointestinal bacteria influence fungal cell wall composition during co-culture with C. albicans, including as complex communities derived from the gut. Using Escherichia coli as a model, we show that bacterial-induced fungal cell wall remodeling occurs rapidly and is mediated by secreted bacterial metabolite(s). Fungal mutant analysis revealed that the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which is critical for responding to environmental stresses, has an important role in regulating this cell wall remodeling phenotype through the Sln1 histidine kinase. Importantly, bacterial-mediated fungal cell wall remodeling increases C. albicans resistance to the echinocandins, increases recognition by both dectin-1 and dectin-2, and decreases recognition by human IgA. Overall, this work comprehensively characterizes an interaction between C. albicans and common gastrointestinal bacteria that has important implications for fungal biology and host interactions.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Quantification of these services is lacking so far, and thus, it is not possible to predict scenarios of e.g. future climates. Based on values from a comprehensive groundwater ecosystem study comprising four zones of varying land use and groundwater / surface water exchange, we parameterized a quantitative dynamic food web model (recharged organic carbon, microorganisms using the biodegradable fraction of this carbon, and fauna grazing on the microorganisms). With the model satisfactorily reflecting the field values, we calculated five further scenarios, three of which without fauna (mortality e.g. due to contamination, sudden peaks of temperature etc.). Two of the fauna and two of the no fauna scenarios were run with temperature elevated by 1.5 degree C and 3 degree C, respectively. The ecosystem service of carbon degradation was expressed as the difference in carbon concentration between the beginning of the simulation and the end of the simulation. In most scenarios, remaining carbon increased over time. The remaining carbon in some scenarios was up to 660 times as high in the no fauna scenarios compared to the reference case. Fauna was thus shown to fulfil a service by promoting microbial carbon degradation that may be substantial. Sustainable drinking water production is more reliable and less costly, the more active the groundwater fauna in the production area is. This model set up can serve to test other cases of varying physical and chemical variations and disturbances.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

While species-level pollinator interaction networks are important for predicting community stability, it remains equally crucial to understand individual-level interactions of keystone species in the community. This study examined the role of habitat factors and floral traits in shaping individual-level pollinator interactions of Maytenus senegalensis, a dominant native species in the semi-arid Aravalli Hills. We measured flower production, nectar sugar concentration, flower diameter, and external factors such as percentage soil moisture, distance to habitat edge, and density of co-flowering conspecifics to assess their impact on pollinator interactions and reproductive success. We found significant variation in reproductive investment in the form of flower production and a trade-off with reward quality, where plants with higher flower production were found to have a lower nectar sugar concentration. Higher flower production negatively influenced reproductive success, suggesting the likelihood of increased within-plant visitation. Eristalinus and Apis were the dominant pollinator genera, and overall, Dipterans were found to play a critical role in maintaining the network stability. The presence of flowering conspecific plants in the neighborhood reduced the pollen deposition, suggesting competitive interactions. Moreover, individual plants were found to show some amount of specialization in their interaction niches. We predict that this could lead to further divergence of interaction niches due to pollinator-mediated competition. Any perturbation to interactions of plants with a high degree of pollinator connectance was found to disproportionately influence the network. Overall findings suggest that the individual variation in reproductive investment and trade-off with reward quality had an impact on the plant-pollinator interactions and reproductive success. In semi-arid systems, which are undergoing considerable anthropogenic and climatic changes, our study provides insights into individual pollinator interaction niches and the role of microhabitat factors in species persistence within a community.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Dissolved low molecular weight (LMW) compounds in soil can either be assimilated by microbes or sorb onto mineral surfaces, forming mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). This creates potential competition between microbes and mineral surfaces for LMW compounds, potentially influencing whether particulate organic matter (POM) is retained or depolymerized by microbes to produce LMW substrates. Therefore, microscale interactions between unoccupied mineral surfaces and microbial enzymes may mediate patterns of POM and MAOM storage, particularly in soils varying in MAOM saturation. To explore this, we adapted an individual-based microscale model to simulate POM retention and new MAOM formation under different initial POM qualities (carbon:nitrogen ratio; C:N) and MAOM saturation levels, while also considering microbial social-like dynamics, which emerge from interactions between microbes with different capacities to produce and share public goods (in this case, extracellular enzymes). Consistent with prior findings, the presence of these dynamics slowed decomposition of initial POM pools. Additionally, MAOM saturation affected microbial community properties, new MAOM formation, and POM decomposition only when social dynamics were included. The patterns of POM decomposition and MAOM formation identified in our work align with observations of simultaneous POM and MAOM formation in undersaturated soils from prior field studies, suggesting that regulation of enzyme production via microbial interactions may be an additional driver of POM and MAOM storage in such soils. Overall, this highlights the importance of explicitly incorporating microbial ecology into our conceptual understanding of C and N cycling, particularly to improve the predictive capacity of ecosystem models and inform soil management strategies that enhance global change mitigation, especially in degraded soils likely to be undersaturated.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

While most studies have focused on ascent, descending behaviors also provide insight into the functional significance of arboreal adaptations. To test how descending vertical supports of varying diameters affects locomotor abilities, we quantified postural and kinematic features during descents and ascents on vertical supports in 21 eutherian and metatherian mammals, and examined their relation to morphology. Primates showed greater variability in descent behaviors, using tail-first and side postures more often than other mammals, which predominantly descended head-first. Overall, animals adopted several kinematic adjustments to enhance stability during descent compared to ascent, including slower speeds, higher duty factors, and greater use of asymmetrical gaits. Additionally, vertical descent strategies reflected trade-offs among body mass, limb proportions, and head mass. Using a morphology-based model, we then inferred possible descent behaviors in 13 extinct euarchontoglires. Our results suggest that ancestral adaptations for vertical locomotion may have promoted frequent upright (head-up) postures in early primates.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

However, organized into highly repetitive -satellite higher-order repeats (HORs), human centromere sequences have long resisted detailed genomic analysis. Although the development of long-read sequencing platforms has enabled the analysis of complete centromere sequences, their application to a large set of samples is still largely limited, preventing our understanding of centromere variation and haplotype structures across large human populations and the structural basis of centromere-involving translocations in cancer. Here we show that rare k-mers present in centromeric regions can serve as effective markers for dissecting the complexity of centromere structure, particularly that of active -satellite HOR arrays (aHOR arrays), across human populations and for understanding centromere-involving abnormalities in cancer. Based on rare k-mer-based clustering, centromere aHOR arrays are clustered into discrete haplogroups (aHOR-HGs) with distinct structural features. These k-mers were also used to develop a framework that enables the inference of haplogroups in a given sample based on short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) data (ascairn). By applying ascairn to large-scale human population datasets (n > 3,300), we revealed the diversity of aHOR-HGs and their geographic histories across populations. The rare k-mer-based approach was also applied to investigate the structure of 1p/19q co-deletion, a highly recurrent centromere-involving translocation in IDH-mutated oligodendrogliomas. Analyzing short-read WGS data from 142 cases with 1p/19q co-deletion using rare k-mers, we showed that breakpoints of 1p/19q co-deletion were mapped to aHOR arrays in chromosomes 1 (D1Z7) and 19 (D19Z3), which was validated by long-read sequencing of two 1p/19q co-deletion-positive cases. Notably, the translocation preferentially involved haplogroups composed of haplotypes containing larger regions susceptible to rearrangement. These results highlight the role of rare k-mers in dissecting the complexity of centromere sequences and their evolutionary history as well as understanding centromere-involving abnormalities associated with human diseases.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Pooled CRISPR screening using lentiviral gRNA libraries is a powerful method for deciphering gene functions, but gRNA delivery to cells in situ remain challenging, which constitutes a key obstacle to Perturbation Atlas construction. We have previously described a large-scale mosaic multiplex in situ CRISPR perturbation platform in the whole mice named iMAP, where the Cas9 guides are \"stored\" in germline-transmitted transgenes but inducibly \"released\" (expressed) via Cre-mediated recombination, thus eradicating the need for viral libraries.

Here we report that replacing the recombination hotspot at the transgene with an inert sequence lacking LoxP sites markedly improved the uniformity of guide representation, making it comparable with that of viral libraries. We next profiled, across 46 tissues, the abundance of the guides targeting 71 (52%) genes encoding writers, readers and erasers of RNA modifications, shedding light on their context-specific functions in vivo. Furthermore, in a tumor model, we identified regulators of NK cell activation in tumor microenvironment, which was validated in human NK cells, thus offering potential targets for improving cancer immunotherapy.

Four K. pneumoniae sub-lineages defined with cgMLST/LINcodes are known to cause distinct infections of the nasal and/or upper respiratory passages: SL91 and SL10031 (also referred to as subspecies ozaenae), SL10032 (subspecies rhinoscleromatis) and SL82. These sub-lineages have also demonstrated reduced carbon source utilisation, which in other species has been linked with high loads of insertion sequences (IS). Methods: We performed comparative genomics, analysed IS and constructed genome-scale metabolic models for available public sequences from these four sub-lineages and compared them to other sub-lineages from the wider K. pneumoniae population. Results: The four focal sub-lineages displayed significantly higher IS loads (median range 88 to 120 per genome) compared to other K. pneumoniae sub-lineages (median range 12 to 73). Notably, each K. pneumoniae sub-lineage had unique IS profiles, consistent with distinct evolutionary trajectories of IS acquisition and expansion. Across sub-lineages, higher IS loads were inversely associated with the number of metabolic model genes per genome (R2 = 0.16, p <0.001), as well as predicted aerobic substrate utilisation for phosphorus sources (R2 = 0.39, p<0.001) as per a second-degree polynomial regression model (n = 1,664 genomes). Additionally, the four IS-dense sub-lineages displayed a combination of convergent sub-lineage-specific substrate utilisation losses including parallel loss of 3-Phospho-D-glycerate, D-Glycerate-2-phosphate, Phosphoenolpyruvate utilisation as carbon/phosphorus sources. Finally, inspection of IS insertion sites demonstrated frequent and non-destructive insertion next to transcriptional, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism genes. Conclusions: IS loads were significantly and inversely associated with metabolic substrate usage within K. pneumoniae, whereby sub-lineages that had higher numbers of IS also had reduced metabolic capacity. We hypothesise that an insertional tolerance model explains these findings, whereby IS can only insert into metabolically-tolerable sites for the individual cell and any impacts on metabolism are not detrimental for survival.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Using primary microglia from wild-type (WT) and Nlrp3 knockout (Nlrp3 KO) mice, alongside human monocyte-derived microglia, we demonstrate that paraquat induces dose-dependent NLRP3 activation in LPS-primed WT microglia via NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This results in ASC speck formation and IL-1{beta} release, which is absent in Nlrp3 KO microglia and blocked by the selective NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950. While Syn alone fails to induce pyroptosis, co-treatment with paraquat resulted in caspase-1-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and gasdermin-D cleavage, hallmarks of pyroptotic cell death. This response was also suppressed by NLRP3 inhibition. Our findings reveal that paraquat acts as a critical second hit to license Syn-induced inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis in microglia, highlighting a mechanistic link between environmental toxin exposure and innate immune activation in PD pathogenesis. Targeting this axis with brain-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitors may offer an alternative therapeutic avenue for synucleinopathies associated with environmental toxins.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

However, to facilitate their broader uptake into toxicity testing practice, a better understanding of functional capacities and expression of toxicologically relevant molecular targets is needed. Here, we present an extensive molecular profiling of the zebrafish embryonic cell line PAC2, combining global proteomics across cell population growth phases (over 7300 protein groups) with matched transcriptomics at exponential and stationary phase (over 14500 transcripts). Proteome coverage was sufficiently deep to reveal functional insights consistent with those derived from transcriptomics data, despite differences in the total number of measured genes. Major gene expression shifts detected upon transition from exponential to stationary cell population growth phase indicated reduction in DNA replication, translation, metabolism, and cell cycle regulation, along with increased stress responses, immune system responses, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Functional annotation revealed expression of core cellular processes along with a number of toxicologically relevant pathways, including xenobiotic metabolism, stress signaling, and nuclear receptors responsive to important chemical classes, such as steroids (e.g., estrogens, glucocorticoids) and chemicals known to disrupt lipid metabolism, e.g., through interaction with peroxisome proliferation activating receptors. These findings reinforce the potential of PAC2 cells to offer a versatile in vitro model for studying fish cell biology and omics-enhanced exploration of chemical toxicity mechanisms, aided by the well-developed molecular annotation in zebrafish. Moreover, the analysis approaches developed in this work offer a blueprint for molecular baseline characterization of other fish cell lines.

We show that the DNA language model, GROVER, can predict DSBs using sequence alone. DSB hotspots tend to contain GC-rich sequences that belong to promoters, genes and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). Additionally, we identified several specific short sequences (tokens) that are associated with modulating DSB sensitivity. Another model using epigenomic features outperforms the sequence-only model, highlighting complementary and cell-type specific information in the epigenome. Integrating sequence and epigenomic data yields the best performance, demonstrating their synergy. Analyzing this model revealed that genome stability information encoded in chromatin marks H3K36me3 and DNase-seq can be learned from the sequence, but not H3K27ac or H3K9me3. Embedding histone data directly into the GROVER architecture enabled cell-type specific modeling with performance matching the full epigenome model. Our results suggest that while epigenomic modifications provide important information, such as cell-type specificity, much of the information shaping DSB patterns is already encoded in the DNA sequence itself. Our integrative modeling approach not only sheds light on DSB patterns but also provides a generalizable strategy for tracing back the origin of predictive signals in genomic data.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

In the brain, its function is to convert androgens into neuroestrogens, ensuring balanced hormonal signalling. Both animal experiments and human studies have shown that, in males, disruption of aromatase, either genetically or epigenetically, can increase symptoms of autism. Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a common plastic chemical, can increase levels of DNA methylation - a key epigenetic modification - at the brain-specific CYP19A1 promoter, P1.f, reducing CYP19A1 expression. However, the extent to which other neurodevelopmentally relevant environmental exposures influence P1.f methylation remains unclear. Here, in the Barwon Infant Study (BIS) birth cohort (N = 906), we analysed the association between 25 prenatal exposures (from five classes previously linked to neurodevelopmental outcomes: manufactured chemicals, air pollution, and pharmacological, nutrition and sunlight-related factors) and methylation of the CYP19A1 P1.f promoter using Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression. We found that the WQS mixture index, a weighted combination of the prenatal exposures, was positively associated with higher P1.f methylation (Adjusted Mean Difference (AMD) = 0.712 (95% CI 0.11, 1.315), p = 0.021), indicating reduced brain aromatase activity. Prenatal exposures with the strongest contribution to the mixture effect included bisphenols (including BPA), reduced sunlight, household mould, phthalates, low folate intake, and air pollution. These findings highlight epigenetic modification of the aromatase gene as a biologically plausible, convergent mechanism through which multiple environmental risk factors for autism may exert effects.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Like their exogenous counterparts, HERVs derive from ancestral germinal infections and typically follow a canonical structure of LTR-gag-pol-env-LTR, where the gag, pol, and env genes encode structural, enzymatic, and envelope proteins, respectively. Here, we present a comprehensive resource annotating conserved retroviral domains across 120,000+ ORFs derived from internal HERV regions. Using a reproducible pipeline based on HMMER and InterProScan, we identified over 17,540 domain hits-primarily from pol genes such as reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and protease-and quantified their structural conservation. Hundreds of domains exceed 95% alignment coverage, revealing a surprising abundance of full-length, retrovirus-like domains in both young and ancient HERV families. While the HERVK subfamily retains the most complete polyprotein architecture-including 13 loci with nearly intact Gag, Pol, and Env domains-many full-length Pol domains were also found in other families such as HERVH, HERVW, and HERVE. Our high-resolution annotations recover conserved catalytic motifs in Pol domains and transmembrane features in Env, enabling fine-grained functional interpretation.

X.; Lin, S.", "abstract": "High-throughput single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) technologies have opened new avenues for investigating cell-to-cell variability in the three-dimensional organization of the genome within individual nuclei. Despite their potential, analyses of scHi-C data are hindered by data sparsity, which varies substantially across cells. To address this challenge, recent methods aim to denoise scHi-C data and differentiate between two types of zero entries: structural zeros (SZs), which reflect true absence of contacts due to biological structure, and dropouts (DOs), which arise from insufficient sequencing depth. However, current dissimilarity measures used in downstream analyses, such as Euclidean distance and Kendall's tau, treat all zeros as equivalent, thus do not distinguish between SZs and DOs nor recognize the special role of SZs in capturing cell-to-cell variability. Such oversight limits the ability to accurately capture biologically meaningful differences between cells. In this study, we introduce structural-zeros-aware Kendall's tau (szKendall), a novel dissimilarity metric that explicitly incorporates the spatial structure of 2D contact matrices and leverages the presence or absence of shared SZs across cells. Through comprehensive simulations and analysis of real scHi-C datasets, we demonstrate that szKendall more effectively captures key structural features and achieves superior performance in cell clustering tasks compared to existing approaches.

To simulate the heterogeneous oxygen distribution found in tumors, the ToC model incorporates an oxygen gradient achieved through a straightforward chemical oxygen scavenging system. A unique innovation of this device is the integration of a thin scintillator plate, which enables high-resolution radioluminescence microscopy imaging of tumor metabolism under hypoxia and normoxia conditions using clinically approved PET tracers such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). The response of this hypoxic model to radiation therapy (10 Gy X-ray) demonstrated ~4-fold higher radioresistance compared to the normoxic ToC model, as assessed by colony formation potential. Additionally, DNA damage observed in the normoxic ToC model was ~5-fold higher than that in the hypoxic model. Furthermore, the metabolic consumption of glucose was found to mirror the localization of hypoxia, validating the use of this biomarker for planning radiation therapy.

There remains much debate about whether these models are interpretable, either inherently, or when using downstream interpretability or explainability techniques (xAI). Conclusions are further complicated by the steady publication of novel models, each with their own architectures, evaluations, and xAI experimental designs. Here, we posit that many of these complications arise due to a lack of explicit specification of a generative model, baseline comparators, and thorough evaluation. Consequently, we attempt to reconcile concerns of interpretability under a motif-based generative model by simulating at scale over 1000 motif-based genetic architectures and evaluating the ability of different model architectures to predict an outcome given a sequence as input. We first show that a single convolutional layer is sufficient to discover motifs in a sequence-to-function model due to the way in which it shares the gradient locally amongst nucleotides. We next build upon this by showing that across genetic and network architectures - including attention, LSTMs, and stacked convolutions - most models are capable of modeling motifs and their interactions, with certain models outperforming others across genetic contexts and sample sizes. Distinguishing between shallow-level interpretations of motifs and deeper, gradient-based interpretations of motifs, we show that these approaches discover separate but overlapping sets of motifs, depending on motif characteristics. Finally, we validate our findings on an experimental dataset, and conclude that while attention is accurate, there are genetic contexts in which other neural networks complement findings from attention-based models and produce higher correlations between predictive performance and interpretability. The work here suggests that when a generative model is correctly specified, most models are to an extent interpretable, whether their architectures are inherently so or not. Moreover, our work highlights opportunities for methods development in motif discovery and also implies that employing a mixture of model architectures may be best for biological discovery.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

In plants, dioecy often evolved more recently than in the best-studied animal systems, making plants especially important for understanding how separate sexes evolved independently from functionally hermaphrodite ancestors. Despite long-standing theories of developmental trade-offs in sex allocation, the underlying genetic mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that the XY sex determination system in the dioecious plant species Eurycorymbus cavaleriei in Sapindaceae involves two Y-linked mutations that act jointly within the developmental male-female trade-off: YUN{Delta}, a truncated allele that lowers the dosage of the D-class MADS-box gene YUN , and SUNMAO, a novel sRNA locus that silences the X-linked SUN allele. In females, SUN stabilizes the HD-ZIP transcription factor KUN, which is a known sex determinant in another dioecious plant, thereby promoting femaleness by increasing YUN expression; loss of SUN expression, together with the effect of YUN{Delta}, shifts development toward males. Two interlocking regulatory loops in this \"SKY\" module (SUN-KUN-YUN) fine-tunes YUN dosage. This dioecious system in E. cavaleriei likely evolved by sequential mutations in genes acting in the predicted male-female trade-off system, with their close linkage reflecting a translocation, and later recombination-suppressing inversions.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

In plants, methylation occurs in the CG, CHG and CHH contexts, via distinct DNA methyltransferases including MET1, CMT3 and the RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway via DRM2. In interspecific hybrids, these epigenetic mechanisms are confronted to a mixed small RNA population and two subgenomes harboring specific methylation patterns, therefore generating unique expression profiles. The aim of this work was to understand these regulations by analysing gene expression, DNA methylation and small RNAs in a Citrus hybrid resulting from the cross between C. reticulata (mandarin) and C. australasica (caviar lemon). Haplotype-resolved subgenomes assembly identified hundreds of alleles-specifically expressed genes. Asymmetric reprogramming of methylation was observed, in particular an increase in the CHH context in C. australasica haplotype. Surprisingly, CHH methylation, usually associated with gene silencing, was correlated here with increased expression, but also with abundant 24nt small RNA populations at their promoter regions. Similar analyses of the parental lines suggest the correlation between CHH methylation-enriched promoter and high expression level is not due to the hybridization, but seem to be generally true for all citrus. These observations suggest that, in citrus fruit, RdDM could activate transcription.

Control strategies are commonly carried out by the use of chemical insecticides even though resistance of S. frugiperda populations to several insecticides has been reported. Last decades, have registered rapid adoption of organic and agroecological practices in horticulture, particularly those that rely on bioinputs such as biopesticides and biofertilizers.

In response, social insects have evolved social immune defenses, which includes the production and communal use of antimicrobial compounds. The origins of sociality in insects are closely associated with the development of exocrine glands that secrete these antimicrobials. However, it is unclear how social insects prevent pathogens from evolving resistance to these compounds given their frequent use. We tested whether ants reduce this risk by producing chemically diverse and pathogen-specific antimicrobial compounds. Using solvents of varying polarity, we extracted antimicrobial compounds from six ant species and tested their inhibitory effects on Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and a fungal pathogen. Our results show that ants produce multiple classes of antimicrobial compounds with distinct chemical properties and targeted activity, though the strength and specificity of inhibition vary across species. Notably, five of the six ant species tested inhibited Candida auris, an emerging fungal pathogen of critical concern in human medicine due to its multidrug resistance. These findings suggest that social immunity in ants is reinforced by both chemical diversity and pathogen specificity, offering an evolutionary strategy that may help prevent antimicrobial resistance in dense, socially complex environments.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Using a cross-infection matrix of 72 B. cinerea isolates infected on 57 plant genotypes distributed across 15 eudicot species, we identified general and host-dependent fungal components of lesion formation. Transcriptome profiling at 48 hours post-inoculation revealed two distinct pathogen gene modules: (1) a set of general lesion-associated genes enriched in primary metabolism, showing similar expression across hosts but varied among isolates; and (2) a set of high-entropy, host specific-inducible genes, organized into distinct co-regulated modules that respond dynamically to specific host cues. Both gene sets were genomically dispersed, lacking structural clustering, and were under different levels of selective constraints.

This study aimed to assess whether deep learning methods can enhance the prediction of genetic values in crossbred populations by effectively capturing heterosis. We tested several prediction models that varied in how they incorporate genetic information, including purebred and crossbred data, breed composition, and breed-of-origin of alleles, on both simulated and real crossbred data. Finally, we also proposed an approach in which additive genetic effects and heterosis are predicted separately and then combined using effect-specific weights. Results: Our results show that the presence of heterosis reduced the accuracy of traditional statistical methods but improved the performance of deep learning models. When heterosis was present, the highest prediction accuracy for total genetic value was achieved by combining additive genetic values, predicted using statistical method, with the predicted heterosis values, using a weighted sum. The explicit prediction of heterosis using deep learning and a regression method yielded similar results. The integration of breed-of-origin of alleles achieved the highest prediction accuracy for the additive genetic effect, outperforming both methods based on breed composition, and those that train the GBLUP model by combining purebred and crossbred animals. When applied to real data, adding the predicted heterosis did not increase prediction accuracies of crossbred animals, a result that we attributed to the homogeneity of the real crossbred population and its limited sample size. Conclusions: The usefulness of deep learning for crossbred prediction depends on the degree of heterosis exhibited in the traits. Incorporating both additive genetic effects and heterosis considering the breed-of-origin of the alleles in the genomic information and effect-specific weighting leads to more accurate and robust predictions in our simulated data, particularly when crossbred data is heterogeneous. Even when prediction accuracy is not significantly improved, deep learning can still provide valuable insight into the degree of heterosis across traits, offering a deeper understanding of crossbred genetic architecture.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Using the migrating zebrafish lateral line primordium as a tractable in vivo model of organogenesis, we uncover a cell autonomous role for the classical paracrine ligand Fgf3. Transcriptomic profiling and quantitative single-molecule imaging reveal an unexpected class of target genes, including the chemokine scavenger cxcr7b, whose expression decreases both when FGF receptor signaling is blocked and when Fgf3 is overexpressed. High-resolution live imaging shows that Fgf3 accumulates in the nucleus of ligand-producing cells while neighboring cells receive only extracellular ligand. Whole-embryo imaging reveals that this patterning feature is widespread across developing tissues. Mosaic gain-of-function, secretion-defective mutants, and nanobody-directed degradation demonstrate that the nuclear pool of Fgf3 autonomously represses related targets without impairing canonical receptor signaling. Structure-guided comparative trafficking assays suggest that nuclear targeting is a latent property shared by several paracrine FGFs. Together, these findings reveal a morphogen-intrinsic symmetry-breaking mechanism. Secreted Fgf3 activates generic target genes across the field and nuclear Fgf3 selectively silences a subset within source cells, hard-wiring differential responses between signal senders and receivers. We propose that dual secreted-nuclear functionality of FGF ligands may be a general strategy for patterning gene-expression during organogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "During interphase, a typical cell nucleus features spatial compartmentalization of transcriptionally active euchromatin and repressed heterochromatin domains. In conventional nuclear organization, euchromatin predominantly occupies the nuclear interior, while heterochromatin, which is approximately 50% more dense than euchromatin, is positioned near the nuclear periphery. Peripheral chromatin organization can be further modulated by the nuclear lamina, which is itself a deformable structure. While a number of biophysical mechanisms for compartmentalization within rigid nuclei have been explored, we study a chromatin model consisting of an active, crosslinked polymer tethered to a deformable, polymeric lamina shell. Contractile motors, the deformability of the shell, and the spatial distribution of crosslinks all play pivotal roles in this compartmentalization. We find that a radial crosslink density distribution, even with a small linear differential of higher crosslinking density at the edge of the nucleus, combined with contractile motor activity, drives genomic segregation, in agreement with experimental observations. This arises from contractile motors preferentially drawing crosslinks into their vicinity at the nuclear periphery, forming high-density domains that promote heterochromatin formation. We also find an increased stiffness of nuclear wrinkles given the preferential heterochromatin compaction below the lamina shell, which is consistent with instantaneous nuclear stiffening under applied nanoindentation. We conclude with the potential for experimental validation of our model predictions.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

D.; Weston, M.; Sassi, Y.", "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a devastating cardiopulmonary disease characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling due to vascular cells dysfunction. Among other clinical signs, emerging data suggest poor sleep quality in patients with PAH; however, how poor sleep impacts hemodynamic burden, symptom severity, and pulmonary vascular remodeling during PAH progression remains unknown. Methods: We used two models of sleep disturbances (sleep fragmentation and chronic jet lag) and different mouse models of PAH to determine the effects of poor sleep on PAH. We carried out timepoint quantitative PCR analyses to define the clock gene oscillations in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) isolated from non-PAH and PAH patients. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis, immunostaining, and proliferation assays were used to explore the mechanisms by which poor sleep impacts PAH. Electroencephalogram and Electromyogram recordings (EEG/EMG) were used to determine whether PAH affects sleep in mice. Results: Poor sleep exacerbated right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PAH. RNA-seq and immunostaining analyses showed that poor sleep induces lung inflammation. Inflammation affected the pulmonary vascular molecular clock to drive PASMC hyperproliferation and increased migration. SMC-specific deletion of Bmal1 protected mice from RV dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and PAH. EEG/EMG measurements demonstrated that PAH causes poor sleep quality in mice. Lastly, we showed that improving sleep via melatonin delivery and blunting inflammation with clodronate inhibited pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that PAH causes poor sleep which in turn induces inflammation, increases PASMC proliferation, and exacerbates PAH. This suggests that the relationship between PAH and poor sleep is a self-amplifying cycle, and that a combination of hypnotic and anti-inflammatory drugs may give PAH patients better clinical outcomes.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Asexual reproduction in filamentous fungi is a common, efficient and fast differentiation process, for producing large numbers of asexual spores (conidia), which can be distributed through the air to colonize new environments. The whole process is tightly controlled by specific regulatory proteins. Among those major regulators is the zinc-finger domain protein of SclB (Sclerotia like B), known to influence various aspects of asexual growth and secondary metabolism in Aspergillus nidulans as well as other filamentous fungi. Two different growth conditions of A. nidulans were compared to obtain a mechanistic overview for the role of SclB, mainly during the transition of the fungus from vegetative to asexual growth. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was coupled with next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and combined with transcriptomic analyses (RNA-seq). SclB coordinates this developmental shift mainly by controlling the expression of genes encoding for few, however, prominent regulators of conidiation. They include the transcription factors BrlA, VelB and SclB and the pheromone oxygenase PpoC. Association of SclB to promoter regions requires the newly identified SclB response element (SRE) with a nine base-pair DNA motif. Scl2 is the corresponding protein in the fungal plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae and partially complements the {Delta}sclBA. nidulans asexual deficiency. This supports a conserved function of this regulator among different fungal species. In summary, SclB coordinates transition from vegetative growth to asexual reproduction in A. nidulans through in vivo transcriptional control over genes coding for established players of conidia formation.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

However, the disease mechanism remains unclear, particularly with respect to muscle stem cell (MuSC) function and muscle regeneration. We examined the consequences of JAG2 deficiency and modeled pathogenic JAG2 variants in vitro and in vivo, the latter in mouse and fly models and with particular attention to the MuSC-muscle endothelial cell (MuEC) niche. We found that both JAG2 deficiency and overexpression of pathogenic JAG2 variants impaired Notch signaling and myogenic self-renewal and differentiation. MuSCs were depleted in hypomorphic Jag2sm mice, corresponding with impaired muscle regeneration in those mice. Co-culture experiments and the examination of cell-type-specific JAG2 conditional knockout mice demonstrated that MuEC-specific JAG2 knockout resulted in reduced MuSC self-renewal, while MuSC-specific JAG2 knockout resulted in reduced myogenic differentiation. Human reference JAG2, but not human pathogenic variants of JAG2, rescued the deficiency of Serrate (Ser), the Drosophila ortholog of JAG2. Therefore, pathogenic variants in JAG2 impair muscle development and regeneration through disrupted cell-autonomous cis-inhibition and non-autonomous trans-activation involving Notch signaling dysfunction.

The ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus), an intertidal keystone predator along the North American Pacific coast, has long been considered to have little spatial genetic structure due to its extended larval dispersal period and thus high potential for gene flow. Here we characterize the spatial genomic architecture of P. ochraceus using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from individuals spanning over 3,000km of coastline from Alaska to southern California. Our analyses of putatively neutral SNPs evince considerable mixing throughout the latitudinal range yet reveal substantial population structure between outer Pacific coast populations and those residing within the semi-enclosed estuary of the Salish Sea, suggesting restricted gene flow and demographic divergence between these regions. Genomic divergence is further supported by evidence of selection, with outlier loci highlighting extended regions of low diversity in the Salish Sea, consistent with recent selective sweeps and potential local adaptation to the distinct estuarine conditions. These findings are consistent with the role of oceanographic barriers or environmental heterogeneity in shaping population structure in P. ochraceus, challenging an earlier notion of range-wide homogeneity. By exploring neutral and adaptive genetic diversity in this keystone marine species, we provide valuable insights for its capacity to persist in a rapidly changing world.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

However, conventional methods for measuring alveolar septum (tabique) thickness rely on manual annotation, which is time-consuming and observer-dependent, compromising comparability and reproducibility. In this study, we introduce a novel, fully automated approach based on two-dimensional spatial autocorrelation function (2D-ACF) analysis to quantify septum thickness from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained lung tissue sections. After validating the method with a simulated data set, the new approach was applied to a murine model of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) induced by intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), under two dietary conditions: normal (ND) and high-fat diet (HFD), thereby testing our approach with a double hit protocol for ALI development. The 2D-ACF analysis provided a robust metric of structural organization, allowing for an unbiased estimation of mean septum thickness across entire tissue images. Compared to controls, LPS instillation increased septal thickness more than six-fold, with further thickening observed in the HFD+Instilled group. These findings were consistent across >400 images and captured subtle additive effects of metabolic stress on lung injury. Traditional manual measurements of septum thickness exhibited substantial inter-observer variability, particularly in the LPS-instilled group, where structural heterogeneity made consistent interpretation challenging. This subjectivity limits the reproducibility of histopathological evaluations, especially under pathological conditions with subtle anatomopathological differences. In contrast, the 2D-ACF method offered a standardized and observer-independent approach. A direct comparison between methods revealed a strong and statistically significant correlation in the instilled group (r = 0.89, p < 0.001), indicating that the 2D-ACF captures key structural features aligned with expert assessments while reducing user bias. In summary, the 2D-ACF framework offers a powerful alternative to conventional image analysis for studying lung pathology. Its adaptability to different experimental settings and potential to be extended to other tissues with spatial heterogeneity makes it a valuable tool for translational biomedical research and digital pathology.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Bacteria are exposed to sulfites during the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, during respiration using sulfur-containing electron acceptors, in host environments, and as food preservatives.

Recent work showed that the LysR-type transcriptional regulator YeiE binds to sulfite to activate sulfite reduction gene expression. Using the model enteric pathogen, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, we show that YeiE is an autoregulator whose expression is enhanced by sulfite. We demonstrate here that the mechanism of sulfite stress resistance is distinct from pathways of sulfur assimilation for cysteine biogenesis. YeiE is necessary for survival in sulfite stress due to its regulation of the poorly characterized adjacent gene, yeiH. A yeiH deletion mutant is more sensitive to the growth-inhibiting effects of sulfite than a yeiE deletion mutant, demonstrating YeiH is the primary driver of sulfite stress resistance in vitro.

They have become, alongside sequence alignments, the cornerstone of bioinformatics. While embeddings cannot replace alignments, they can greatly help improving their quality. Our goal is replacing the BLOSUM matrices, the decades-old standard scoring system for protein alignment, with an embedding-based scoring method. Results: We introduce a new scoring function and algorithm for local alignment of protein sequences, we offer a new comprehensive framework for evaluating local alignments. The score between two residues is given by the cosine similarity of their Ankh-embedding vectors and the algorithm uses dynamic programming with affine penalty. For the evaluation, we built multiple datasets, using both natural and inserted sequences, from the Conserved Domain Database, BALiBASE, and GPCRdb, designed a new algorithm for local alignment extraction, localization and quality evaluation, and employed five distance metrics to evalu- ate the similarity with the true alignment. We performed nearly one and a half million tests to compare the new algorithm with the best BLOSUM matrices, specialized GPCRtm matrices, and top programs, such as PEbA, ProtT5-score, DEDAL, vcMSA and pLM-BLAST. Regarding the protein embedding models, Ankh not only surpasses the best combination of ProtT5 and ESM2, but appears to better understand the \"language\" of proteins, as it behaves much better on natural sequences compared to artificial ones obtained by inserting domains in random protein sequences. Also, while ProtT5 and ESM2 combine to produce better results, Ankh does not combine well with other embeddings.

In bacteria, T-box riboswitches play a critical role in regulating the concentrations of amino acids by sensing and decoding the aminoacylation status of tRNAs for precise control of amino acid biosynthesis and transport pathways. We used computer simulations to probe the mechanism of tRNA recognition by a translational T-box riboswitch using the \\textit{iles} T-box riboswitch as a model system. We show that the T-box aptamer populates three distinct thermodynamic states -- undocked, predocked, and docked -- depending on the relative orientation between its three stems (stem I, II, and IIA/B). The relative population of the three states is strongly dependent on the Mg2+ concentration. In the undocked and predocked states, the freely moving stem I catches the tRNA from the solution using the `fly-casting' mechanism. Subsequently, the tRNA-bound stem I docks to stem II in a specific orientation with the help of noncanonical intra- and inter-backbone hydrogen bonds, which facilitate tRNA interaction with the discriminator domain to detect the aminoacylation state of tRNA and regulate the gene. Since T-box riboswitches are prime targets in designing antibiotics, our proposed mechanism of tRNA recognition by T-box reveals multiple critical sites in the riboswitch that can be targeted for developing new antibiotics. Interestingly, molecules acting as antibiotics exist targeting one of the proposed sites.

This effect is particularly relevant for sensing applications in complex mixtures or cellular contexts, where genome- and transcriptome-derived sequences may impede CRISPR-Cas activity. Using in vitro assays under defined conditions, we systematically examine the influence of background single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) on reaction kinetics.

Guide RNAs with low GC content and a high purine fraction in the seed region were least affected by background sequences.

In complex coacervates, suppression of phase separation is rationalized by charge inversion when increasing the concentration of one component. Here, we show that suppression of biomolecular condensates of the RNA-binding protein hnRNPA1 at high RNA concentration is driven by a different mechanism, namely the competition with formation of nano-sized protein-RNA clusters in the dilute phase. We show that the competition is modulated not only by RNA concentration, but also by the type of RNA, with specific RNA being more effective in promoting cluster formation than unspecific RNA. We further show that protein-RNA clusters convert into amyloid fibrils over a longer time-scale compared to condensates, therefore providing higher kinetic stability. The competition between clustering and phase separation reported in this study provides a unifying framework to understand the distinct assemblies of hnRNPA1 in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, where the protein is exposed to different types and concentrations of RNA.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Yet, the spatial and temporal dynamics of infestations, species composition, and interactions with natural parasitoids remain poorly understood. Here, we present a long-term, multi-site studies of Protocalliphora infestations in 2,673 Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) nests, based on 16 years of data (2004-2019) collected across a 10,200-squared-km gradient of agricultural intensity in southern Quebec, Canada. We found that Protocalliphora infestation prevalence and load (number of puparia) in Tree Swallow nests, varied markedly across space and time, with cyclical patterns emerging at approximately 75% of sites. This suggests the influence of both regional and local processes. Probability of hyperparasitism of Protocalliphora puparia by Nasonia parasitoid wasps was high but variable (min ~48%; max ~90%; mean ~70%), likely contributing to the observed temporal oscillations in Protocalliphora prevalence and load. We also documented substantial interannual shifts in the relative abundance of three Protocalliphora species (P. bennetti, P. metallica, P. sialia), emphasizing the importance of species-level resolution in ecological studies of parasitism. Morphometric analyses revealed considerable overlap in puparia size among species, challenging the utility of traditional diagnostic traits for species identification. Finally, we report the first field estimates of Nasonia dormancy and/or mortality within hosts, which were observed in 3% to 16% of Protocalliphora puparia depending on year.

Differences in brain metabolism between sexes in ALS patients have also been reported; however, the specific molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. As growing evidence supports a strong metabolic component in ALS, this study investigates alterations in leptin, one of the key regulators of metabolism, that is known to be altered during ALS progression in rNLS8 mice, a transgenic mouse model of ALS which closely recapitulates the TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) pathology observed in most patients with ALS. We also examined changes in hypothalamic neuronal genes involved in metabolic regulation through food intake in rNLS8 mice. Additionally, pathological alterations in the spinal cord, a primary site of ALS pathology, were also assessed. Using molecular biology techniques we analysed the expression levels of leptin, its long receptor (Ob-Rb), and its downstream signaling pathways (Akt and STAT3) in rNLS8 mice compared to age- and sex-matched wild-type littermates. Our results revealed significant sex- and disease stage-dependent differences in leptin and Ob-Rb expression in white adipose tissue and the hypothalamus, along with increased activation of the Akt signaling pathway in the spinal cord of rNLS8 mice.

On this basis, we followed infection of the ISV cell-fusing agent virus (CFAV) in two Ae. aegypti laboratory populations, Liverpool (LVP) and ZacPanda (ZacP), and studied their immune responses, including resistance and tolerance, along with physiological and fitness impacts of CFAV infection. Our results demonstrate that CFAV establishes life-long infections with a comparable activation of resistance mechanisms, in both LVP and ZacP mosquitoes. In contrast, ZacP mosquitoes exhibited greater tolerance to CFAV than LVP accompanied by the ability to maintain metabolic homeostasis during infection. In neither ZacP nor LVP, CFAV resulted in reproductive impairment. These findings highlight a key role for tolerance mechanisms, which through regulation of energetic resources, contribute to sustain persistent viral infections in mosquitoes.

Here, we report a synthetic immune cell system coupled with machine learning to enable TCR functional and specificity mapping of peptide-HLA antigens at proteome-scale. Multi-step immunogenomic engineering of synthetic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) was performed to enable stable mono-allelic integration and precise display of peptide antigens and HLA class I from a defined genomic locus, ensuring genomically-encoded antigen presentation. Compatible with a synthetic TCR displaying T cell system, this platform incorporates a fluorescent reporter of cytokine-mediated signaling for real-time activation detection in both synthetic APCs and T cells. We combined this screening with diverse peptide antigen libraries and deep sequencing to train supervised machine learning models. These models were applied to predict TCR specificity to peptide-HLA antigens across the entire human proteome. Experimental validation confirmed novel off-targets for therapeutic TCR candidates, including for a clinically-approved TCR therapeutic.

However, the compact and segmented nature of the IAV genome presents major challenges for engineering genetically stable reporter viruses with minimal fitness defects. To address this, we developed a replication-competent IAV incorporating a tandem split-GFP reporter strategy. Specifically, we appended seven tandem repeats of the GFP11 peptide (GFP11x7) to the C-terminus of the PB2 or PA polymerase subunit. Viruses contained or lacked a self-cleaving 2A peptide between the viral and reporter genes to create polymerase fusion proteins or released GFP, respectively. These viruses are complemented in trans by cells expressing GFP1-10, allowing bright fluorescence with minimal disruption to viral function. The tandem GFP11 reporter viruses exhibit delayed replication kinetics, but are genetically stable over serial passages with a strong concordance between GFP signal and viral gene expression. We demonstrate their utility in high-throughput applications including fluorescence-based quantification of infection, neutralizing antibody titration, antiviral drug screening, and host factor identification, with results matching traditional assays but on an accelerated timeline. Furthermore, we engineered a battery of GFP1-10-expressing cell lines from multiple vertebrate species, illustrating the broad compatibility of this platform for comparative host studies. This system enables sensitive, scalable, and quantitative evaluation of influenza virus replication across diverse experimental contexts.

We saturation-edited twenty codons in the Trypanosoma brucei proteasome beta5 subunit and subjected the resulting MOT libraries to stepwise drug selection.

The resistance profile that emerged allowed us to readily predict routes to spontaneous drug resistance observed within accessible, single nucleotide mutational space. In silico analysis of beta5 subunit mutations predicted impacts on ligand affinity via steric effects, hydrogen-bonding and lipophilicity, which when combined with predictions of proteasome function perturbing mutations, were closely aligned with observed impacts on drug resistance.

We examined how urbanisation, geographic region, and public wildlife feeding influence reported bin-raiding, public attitudes, and the use of control measures towards the world's most urbanised terrestrial carnivore, the red fox, Vulpes vulpes. Online survey data were obtained from 1,275 participants in the United Kingdom.

Specifically, urbanisation and geographic region significantly predicted reports of fox bin-raiding, with urban residents - particularly those living in London - more likely to report such behaviour. Urbanisation influenced people's use of professional pest control of foxes within their area, and geographic region influenced the use of do-it-yourself control measures.

GP maps are typically investigated using computational models of molecular phenotypes (for example, RNA secondary structures and simplified models of protein tertiary and quaternary structures), but GP map concepts are relevant beyond these specific models and so a systematic, model-independent approach is needed. This can be achieved by characterising GP maps in terms of properties like phenotypic frequencies, mutational robustness and evolvabilities, which can be computed for any given GP map. This approach has given insight into the shared features of GP maps and their evolutionary relevance. However, this progress is largely limited to the simplest case, where each genotype corresponds to a single, categorical phenotype. Here, I turn to a more realistic, but also more complex non-deterministic (ND) treatment, where each genotype generates an ensemble of phenotypes: I start by comparing the ND GP maps of the three biophysical models mentioned above using a recently proposed framework. Then, I find a simpler, synthetic map, which replicates key shared features for a range of modelling choices, suggesting that few ingredients are needed for these features to appear and highlighting the importance of non-linearities in GP maps.

This can cause linked genetic variation to \"hitchhike\", and thereby also rise in frequency. This linked variation may include deleterious recessive alleles, previously neutrally harbored at low frequency in heterozygous genotypes. Modeling studies have shown that local effective population size and reduced recombination rate should contribute to the probability of deleterious mutations being swept to high frequency by being linked to beneficial alleles in selective sweeps or inversions. Marine sticklebacks have repeatedly adapted to thousands of freshwater habitats that became available after the last ice age, resulting in the formation of distinct marine and freshwater ecotypes. Selection acts on ancient standing genetic variation present in marine populations, causing freshwater-adaptive alleles to increase rapidly over tens of generations. These genomic regions play a key role in the repeated freshwater adaptation of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits, and evolve under strong selection. Thus, threespine stickleback are an ideal system for investigating the impact of hitchhiking mutation load. We estimate the mutation load in regions of low recombination, including inversions, and the Eda haplotype. We find little evidence for the accumulation of deleterious alleles among genomic regions and populations. Inversions deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in several populations, exhibiting an excess of homozygotes. These observations are consistent with purging facilitated by recombination in inversion karyotypes.

While resistance to chemicals that target neuronal ion channels is well-appreciated, dissecting toxin resistance mechanisms is hampered by its complex genetic basis. Here, we investigated how Drosophila sechellia has evolved resistance to octanoic acid (OA), a historically-important paradigm of adaptation to a natural toxin. OA is an abundant component of Morinda citrifolia noni fruit - the exclusive niche of D. sechellia - and is toxic to many other insects, including its close relatives Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster. We experimentally evolved D. simulans populations with increased OA resistance, identifying hundreds of loci displaying signatures of selection. Cross-referencing of these loci with the results of a genome-wide, CRISPR knockout screen for OA tolerance genes in D. melanogaster S2R+ cells highlighted two proteins of interest: Kraken, a putative detoxification enzyme of the serine hydrolase family expressed most strongly in the digestive and renal systems, and Alkbh7, a ubiquitously-expressed, mitochondrial-localised protein, whose mammalian orthologue functions in fatty acid metabolism. In D. sechellia, kraken and Alkbh7 display both signs of selection and elevated expression, mirrored by their higher transcription in artificially-evolved, OA-resistant D. simulans. In D. melanogaster, loss-of-function of kraken, but not Alkbh7, led to increased susceptibility to OA; conversely, overexpression of Alkbh7, but not kraken, increased OA resistance. Importantly, mutation of these genes in D. sechellia demonstrated a contribution of these proteins to the natural resistance of this species, identifying the first specific loci underlying this multigenic trait. Our results suggest an adaptive role of these genes in shaping OA resistance both under laboratory selection and during D. sechellia's evolutionary history.

To gain further insight into how the ubiquitin system regulates the DDR, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen focused on E3 ligases and related proteins with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. This uncovered the CTLH ubiquitin E3 ligase complex - and particularly one of its core subunits, MAEA - as a critical regulator of the cellular response to single-ended DNA double-strand breaks (seDSBs) and replication stress. In tandem, we identified patients with variants in MAEA who present with neurodevelopmental deficits including global developmental delay, dysmorphic facial features, brain abnormalities, intellectual disability, and abnormal movement. Analysis of patient-derived cell lines and mutation modeling reveal an underlying defect in HR-dependent DNA repair and replication fork restart as a likely cause of disease. We propose that MAEA dysfunction hinders DNA repair by reducing the efficiency of RAD51 loading at sites of DNA damage, which compromises genome integrity and cell division during development.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Collective decision making is a fundamental aspect of group behavior in both animals and humans, and often involves reaching a consensus on the best of n options, using empirical evidence. Although many parallels have been drawn between human and animal collective decisions, collective human behavior is rarely studied in the type of embodied scenarios that animals are often faced with. In this study, we placed human groups in a virtual setup similar to nest site selection in social animals, in which they explored a shared environment and reached a consensus based on their observations of empirical features. In groups of up to 10, participants had to reach consensus on the empirically largest of four candidate sites without verbal communication, instead using movement-based interactions in a custom-developed 3D virtual environment for online multi-participant experiments. The results showed that the speed and accuracy of consensus was importantly modulated by perceptual difficulty and information availability, but that no speed-accuracy trade-off was present. Participants attempted to reach consensus on the empirically largest site by flexibly adapting their use of social information to perceptual difficulty, their spatial position, and the time already spent supporting some option. When a minority of informed individuals were present, these individuals exercised greater independence and influenced the group to faster and more accurate consensus. These results extend previous findings on social decision making strategies in humans to nonverbal scenarios akin to those of social insects.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Unfortunately, practical use of siRNA containing LNPs is still hampered by difficulties, one of them directing LNPs toward specific cells. To improve cell-specific delivery, we have developed a new generation of palmitate-containing ionizable LNPs functionalized with two distinct ligands: i) a targeting peptide (octreotide, Oct), for selective recognition of somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2)-expressing tumor cells, and ii) a cell penetrating peptide (penetratin, RK16) to enhance intracellular delivery. This dually-decorated LNP was used to co-deliver two siRNAs targeting key mediators of drug resistance in HER2+ breast cancer (Hsp27 and HER2) demonstrating strong potential for combinatorial RNAi-based therapies. The Oct moiety conferred high selectivity toward malignant SSTR2-overexpresing (SSTR2OE) HER2+ BC cells, even in heterogeneous environments containing non-tumor epithelial cells. Simultaneously, the RK16 peptide facilitated enhanced intracellular delivery, resulting in improved antiproliferative activity and a notable reduction in the SSTR2-overexpressing cell population compared to non-functionalized LNPs. Taken together, the structural design and biological performance of this novel class of LNP formulation establish it as a versatile and innovative delivery platform for ON-based targeted therapies. By simply altering the targeting peptide moiety and siRNA combination, this dually-functionalized LNP system could be readily adapted for a broad range of tumors and combination treatment strategies. Finally, the inclusion of palmitic acid in the LNP composition selectively contributes to cytotoxicity in palmitate sensitive cell lines, such as SK-BR-3, offering an additional therapeutic advantage when targeting these tumor subtypes.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

The catalytic efficiency of PLP-dependent enzymes is significantly higher than that of free PLP. The recruitment of PLP from the environment by the enzymes, particularly through interactions outside the active site, is the key step determining the occurrence of PLP-mediated catalysis. However, the precise mechanism by which enzymes recruit PLP remains elusive. Methionine {gamma}-lyase (MGL), a PLP-dependent enzyme, catalyzes the degradation of L-methionine, thereby suppressing cancer cell proliferation through serum or dietary methionine depletion. Here, we report the crystal structure of yMGL, which belongs to a newly identified subgroup of cystathionine {gamma}-lyases, in complex with L-methionine and PLP. Through truncating the C-terminal domain of yMGL both in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrated that this domain, outside the canonical PLP-binding domain, is essential for the specific interaction between yMGL and PLP, as well as for efficient L-methionine catabolism. The C terminal domain, which contains a conserved serine residue, forms a unique structural feature at the enzyme entrance that effectively traps PLP and confers PLP specificity. These findings elucidate a previously uncharacterized mechanism of PLP recruitment by MGLs and offer a structural framework to rationally design and engineer MGLs with tailored cofactor selectivity and catalytic performance.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

A.; Wolf, M.", "abstract": "Barriers to nanoparticle drug delivery to the tumor microenvironment such as ECM deposition and clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system have necessitated strategies for more effective tumor penetration. Adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to the surface of nanoparticles (PEGylation) has been widely used to both enhance accumulation at the tumor site and increase blood circulation time. Recent work has also shown that immune cells (e.g. macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils) play an important role in the ability of NPs to effectively target and spread within a tumor. PEG chain characteristics such as size and branching affects how nanoparticles interact with tissues; however, it is unclear how PEGylation type affects NP uptake and cellular distribution in the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we evaluated the influence of both linear and branched PEGylation on nanoparticle biodistribution and uptake in tumor cells as well as tumor-infiltrating immune cells. As compared to conventional surface coatings with linear PEG, we show that modifying PEG structure to a branched conformation increases nanoparticle accumulation in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice, primarily due to significantly enhanced uptake by leukocytes. As compared to uncoated particles, we also found that nanoparticles densely coated with linear or branched PEG accumulated to a greater extent in tumors showing [&ge;]8-fold increases in uptake by tumor-associated macrophages and dendritic cells. These studies provide insight into PEG architecture as a design parameter in nanomedicine that can facilitate the design of more effective cancer therapies.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

To address this, we investigate whether AF-generated distance probability distributions (distograms) can reveal conformational flexibility, using the AIFM1/AK2 complex as a test case. Molecular dynamics simulations identified a hinge-driven motion in AK2 upon AIFM1 binding, which was accurately reflected in distograms from AF2.3 and AF3, though not in their predicted structures. Enhanced sampling and MSA perturbations did not improve flexibility detection in earlier AF2 versions.

While personalisation based on medical images can improve model accuracy, current approaches often require time-consuming workflows to create these models. We present a semi-automatic workflow for creating personalised musculoskeletal models based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that does not require bone segmentation. Our workflow uses 3D Slicer and Python scripts employing Thin-Plate Spline transformation to map 106 homologous landmarks from generic models onto participants' anatomy. Generic-scaled and MRI-based models were created for eight healthy participants, and simulations were performed using the participants' 3D motion capture data. MRI-based models were compared with generic-scaled models through principal component analysis, and joint kinematics and joint contact forces were analysed between both modelling approaches. Clear geometric differences existed between model types, with MRI-based models showing wider pelvises and different femur/tibia proportions. Unlike generic models, MRI-based male and female models displayed systematic differences. Despite anatomical discrepancies, joint kinematics were similar between models of the same individual, except for pelvis tilt. Muscle moment arms were generally aligned with published data from cadaver studies. MRI-based models consistently produced higher joint contact forces with greater inter-individual variation, particularly at knee joints, compared to generic-scaled models. The proposed workflow simplifies MRI-based model creation while revealing significant sensitivity of joint contact forces to individual morphology, highlighting the importance of personalisation for biomechanical analyses.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

This study assessed the relevance to target RAB4A to prevent the development of metastases that occur after treatment. The ability of cancer cells to invade peritumoral tissue is associated with the expression of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 on their surface, which is regulated by RAB4A. When RAB4A was downregulated using shRNA in the TNBC cells D2A1 and MDA-MB-231, a significant reduction in the proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP and the invasion capacity of these TNBC cells were measured. Plasma samples from an early-stage TNBC patient, who developed metastases six months after treatment, were collected before radiotherapy and after the fourth radiation dose. Compared to the plasma collected before radiotherapy, the plasma collected during the treatment significantly enhanced the invasiveness of the TNBC cells, as assessed with Boyden chambers. The development of lung metastases was also stimulated when the D2A1 cells were preincubated with this plasma before their i.v. injection in female Balb/c mice. Importantly, these adverse effects of plasma collected during radiotherapy were significantly blocked by downregulating RAB4A. These results highlight the relevance of developing RAB4A inhibitors to prevent the development of metastases occurring after treatment in TNBC patients.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

However, their morphological diversity across brain regions and cortical layers remains poorly understood. Here, we use StarTrack labeling and in utero electroporation at embryonic day 14 (E14) to reconstruct individual NG2-glial cells in the adult mouse cortex and corpus callosum. Through detailed two- and three-dimensional morphometric analyses, including Sholl analysis, principal component analysis, and hierarchical clustering, we uncover striking layer-specific patterns. NG2-glia in deep cortical layers (L5-6) exhibit significantly larger somatic areas, more elaborate arborizations, and higher process complexity compared to those in superficial layers (L1-4) and the corpus callosum. In contrast, NG2-glia in layer 1 and the corpus callosum share a compact morphology characterized by smaller somata and simplified processes, suggesting common microenvironmental constraints. Moreover, Sholl analysis, principal component analysis, and hierarchical clustering reveal distinct morphological subpopulations within the NG2-glial population and highlight heterogeneity in upper cortical layers. Comparative analyses with astrocytes reveal fundamental structural differences: NG2-glia have thinner, longer processes and larger enclosing radii but occupy smaller volumes, whereas astrocytes form denser, more compact arbors with higher branch numbers. Together, our finding establish the first comprehensive morphological atlas of cortical adult NG2-glia, highlighting region- and layer-specific adaptations that likely underlie their diverse roles in CNS physiology and repair.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

Grasslands with high PGD are more resilient to environmental stress and constitute valuable reservoirs of genetic resources for plant breeding. Therefore, monitoring PGD is the basis for detecting changes in PGD and correspondingly intervening. However, PGD monitoring is often neglected in biodiversity reports due to difficulties in taking representative samples and in using standardised and affordable indicators of PGD. Here we successfully applied two common approaches, multispecies amplicon sequencing (MSAS) and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), to assess PGD of agronomically relevant grassland species. Using MSAS, we were able to taxonomically distinguish five species (Dactylis glomerata L., Festuca pratensis Huds., Lolium perenne L., Trifolium pratense L., Trifolium repens L.) from multispecies samples and differentiate accessions within species, with fixation index (FST) values ranging from 0.014 for T. repens to 0.089 for L. perenne. Based on an extended L. perenne sample set containing mixtures of two cultivars at different ratios, mixtures containing both cultivars at 50% separated from the corresponding cultivars according to this ratio using MSAS and GBS. Furthermore, GBS enabled separation of samples containing two cultivars at a 75:25-ratio from the corresponding cultivars and the 50:50-ratio samples. These results indicate complementing applications of the two approaches in PGD monitoring. While we anticipate that MSAS with its cost-effectiveness could be applied to large-scale PGD monitoring, GBS with its lower detection limit could be applied to studies where cultivar composition shifts are of interest.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "The proper coordination of transcription factors, ATP dependent chromatin remodelers and histone modifications is essential for tissue specific gene expression, but how gene expression is regulated at these different levels is not well understood. In C. elegans, H3K4 methylation that is acquired in the germline is reprorgammed at fertilization by the H3K4me1/2 demethlyase SPR-5/LSD1/KDM1A and the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2/SETDB1/KMT2E. SPR-5/MET-2 maternal reprogramming is required to help establish the germline-soma distinction and prevent developmental delay by preventing inherited H3K4 methylation from inappropriately maintaining germline gene expression in somatic tissues. To determine if the DREAM transcriptional repressor complex and the MEC NuRD ATP dependent nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex function to reinforce SPR-5/MET-2 maternal reprogamming, we asked if loss of these complexes affects the ectopic germline transcription and developmental delay in spr-5; met-2 double mutants. We find that knocking down the DREAM or MEC NuRD complexes specifically exacerbates the developmental delay and ectopic expression of germline genes in the soma caused by loss of SPR-5 and MET-2. In addition, the DREAM and MEC NuRD complexes bind together at SPR-5/MET-2 reprogramming targets. These data suggest that the transcriptional repression of DREAM and the ATP dependent chromatin remodeling and deactylation activities of the MEC NuRD complex are required somatically to reinforce maternal histone reporgamming by SPR-5/MET-2. Thus, these data provide a novel example of how gene regulation is coordinated at multiple levels to maintain the germline-soma distinction and ensure proper development.", "date": "2025-07-27", "journal": ""}
