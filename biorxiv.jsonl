For children, performance is better along the horizontal than vertical meridian (HVA) but does not differ between the lower and upper vertical meridian. Here, we investigated whether the extent of the HVA varies and whether the VMA emerges and develops during adolescence, or whether the VMA only emerges in adulthood. We found that both the HVA and VMA develop gradually throughout adolescence and become as pronounced as those of adults only in late adolescence.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used a hierarchical state-space model to analyzedata from a 139 km line transects in mid-Sweden over 48 years. Adult numbers andbreeding success were analyzed separately, and we included covariates on vole abundance, numbers of snow-free days in autumn and spring, and the last day of frost inMay. We assessed long-term trends in the adult population and estimated the effectsof breeding success and weather variation on short-term changes. The estimates of adult density did not show any trend for the period 1976 to 2023, andthe dynamics were characterized by a strong direct negative density dependence indicating a stationary process. A number of possible mechanisms have been suggested forhow a warmer climate affects willow ptarmigan population dynamics, but our resultsdo not support the hypothesis that lack of snow in autumn and spring increases thevulnerability of willow ptarmigan to predation and leads to population decline. Breeding success is an important driver of changes in, but independent of, adult density. Inaddition to predation, we propose that climate conditions and emerging vegetationduring egg formation and laying is important. We suggest that our results can be explained by a diverse predator assemblage that makes it difficult for the population toescape top-down control, resulting in short-term fluctuations at lower densities.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

J.; Ahmadian, Y.", "abstract": "In the absence of adaptation, the average firing rate of neurons would rise or drop when changes in the environment make their preferred stimuli more or less prevalent. However, by adjusting the responsiveness of neurons, adaptation can yield firing rate homeostasis and stabilise the average rates of neurons at fixed levels, despite changes in stimulus statistics. In sensory cortex, adaptation is typically also stimulus specific, in that neurons reduce their responsiveness to over-represented stimuli, but maintain or even increase their responsiveness to stimuli far from over-represented ones. Here, we present a normative explanation of firing rate homeostasis grounded in the efficient coding principle. Specifically, we show that this homeostasis can arise when neurons adapt their responsiveness to optimally mitigate the effect of neural noise on population coding fidelity, at minimal metabolic cost. Unlike previous efficient coding theories, we formulate the problem in a computation-agnostic manner, enabling our framework to apply far from the sensory periphery. We then apply this general framework to Distributed Distributional Codes, a specific computational theory of neural representations serving Bayesian inference. We demonstrate how homeostatic coding, combined with such Bayesian neural representations, provides a normative explanation for stimulus-specific adaptation, widely observed across the brain, and how this coding scheme can be accomplished by divisive normalisation with adaptive weights. Further, we develop a model within this combined framework, and, by fitting it to previously published experimental data, quantitatively account for measures of stimulus-specific and homeostatic adaption in the primary visual cortex.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Pancreatic islet {beta}-cells are the sole source of endogenous insulin and our understanding of {beta}-cell dysfunction and death in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is incomplete. Single-cell RNA-seq data supports heterogeneity as an important factor in {beta}-cell function and survival. However, it is difficult to identify which {beta}-cell phenotypes are critical for T2D etiology and progression. Our goal was to prioritize specific disease-related {beta}-cell subpopulations to better understand T2D pathogenesis and identify relevant genes for targeted therapeutics. To address this, we applied a deep transfer learning tool, DEGAS, which maps disease associations onto single-cell RNA-seq data from bulk expression data. Independent runs of DEGAS using T2D or obesity status identified distinct {beta}-cell subpopulations. A singular cluster of T2D-associated {beta}-cells was identified; however, {beta}-cells with high obese-DEGAS scores contained two subpopulations derived largely from either non-diabetic or T2D donors. The obesity-associated non-diabetic cells were enriched for translation and unfolded protein response genes compared to T2D cells. We selected CDKN1C and DLK1 for validation by immunostaining in human pancreas sections from healthy and T2D donors. Both CDKN1C and DLK1 were heterogeneously expressed among {beta}-cells. CDKN1C was increased in {beta}-cells from T2D donors, in agreement with the DEGAS predictions, while DLK1 appeared depleted from T2D islets of some donors. In conclusion, DEGAS has the potential to advance our holistic understanding of the {beta}-cell transcriptomic phenotypes, including features that distinguish {beta}-cells in obese non-diabetic or lean T2D states.

This phenomenon may be related to greater elastic energy savings due to increasing tendon stress; however, the mechanisms which enable the rise in stress without additional muscle work remain poorly understood. In this study, we created a three-dimensional (3D) kangaroo musculoskeletal model, integrating 3D motion capture and force plate data, to analyse the kinematics and kinetics of hopping red and grey kangaroos. Using our model, we evaluated how body mass and speed influence (i) hindlimb posture, (ii) effective mechanical advantage (EMA), and (iii) the associated tendon stress in the ankle extensors and (iv) ankle work during hopping. We found that increasing ankle dorsiflexion and metatarsophalangeal plantarflexion likely played an important role in decreasing ankle EMA by altering both the muscle and external moment arms, which subsequently increased energy absorption and peak tendon stress at the ankle. Surprisingly, kangaroo hindlimb posture appeared to contribute to increased tendon stress, allowing more energy to be stored at faster speeds. These posture-mediated increases in elastic energy storage and return could be a key factor enabling kangaroos to achieve energetic benefits at faster hopping speeds, but may limit the performance of large kangaroos due to the risk of tendon rupture.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

In response to stress, some active ribosomes are degraded while others, in bacteria, enter a hibernation state to protect against degradation. RNase I, a conserved T2 family ribonuclease in Escherichia coli, degrades ribosomal RNA to suppress biofilm formation, whereas it interacts with ribosomes. However, how and why RNase I binds to ribosomes remains elusive. Here, we show that hibernating ribosomes bind to RNase I and inhibit its activity, thereby promoting biofilm formation. We determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the hibernating ribosome complexed with RNase I. RNase I interacts with helix 41 of the 16S rRNA and the ribosomal protein uS14 in the head domain of the 30S subunit of the hibernating ribosome and positions its active centre away from helix 41, resulting in its catalytic inactivation. Hibernating ribosomes are protected from RNase I-mediated cleavage, and our in vivo and in vitro analyses revealed that RNase I targets dissociated large and small ribosomal subunits for rRNA degradation. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized regulatory strategy that ribosomes modulate RNase I activity, ensuring both the preservation and timely degradation of ribosomes during environmental stress adaptation.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

This results in a substantial number of misnamed and unnamed collections, a misapprehension of the geographic range of known species, and a gross underestimation of the number of species it contains. To assess the diversity that should be considered as part of Amidella, DNA sequences available for this group were retrieved in public nucleotide databases, using a combination of approaches to achieve a comprehensive representation. Phylogenetic analysis based on the aligned ITS sequences, consistently with the results from other molecular markers (ncLSU, RPB2, TEF1, BTUB), suggests five major clades: one containing the type species Amanita volvata, another for Amanita ponderosa and allies, a third one (roughly half of all species) with Amanita lepiotoides, and two others without valid species yet. At species level, around 81 clades were delimited, of which only 16-17 can be assigned a valid name, with a few more corresponding to provisional taxa listed in the amanitaceae.org website. Up to three further species without assigned sequences might correspond to the proposed clades. The current evidence suggests a rather narrow geographic range for most of these clades. This study provides a phylogeny-arranged outlook of the worldwide distribution of Amidella species, and an infrasectional framework for optimizing taxonomic sampling and designing clade-specific molecular markers to assist in identification.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

The T:E fusion is frequently associated with PTEN loss, and is highly correlated with decreased expression of INPP4B, both of which may compensate for ERG-mediated suppression of PI3K/AKT signaling. We confirmed in PCa cells and a mouse PCa model that ERG suppresses AKT activation, and that one potential mechanism is through downregulation of IRS2. In contrast, ERG knockdown did not increase INPP4B, suggesting its decreased expression is indirect and reflects selective pressure to suppress INPP4B function. Notably, INPP4B expression is similarly decreased in PTEN-intact and PTEN-deficient T:E fusion tumors, suggesting selection for a function distinct from regulation of PI3K activity. As ERG expression in T:E fusion tumors is AR regulated, we further assessed the extent to which AR inhibition increased AKT activity in T:E fusion tumors. T:E fusion positive versus negative PDXs had greater increases in AKT activity after castration. Moreover, in a neoadjuvant trial of AR inhibition prior to radical prostatectomy we similarly found greater increases in AKT activation in the T:E fusion tumors. Together these findings indicate that AKT activation may mitigate the efficacy of AR targeted therapy in T:E fusion PCa, and that these patients may most benefit from combination therapy targeting AR and AKT.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

In the mature central nervous system, L-serine is actively stereo-converted to D-serine, which functions as a neurotransmitter. However, the role of D-serine in cellular metabolism remains unclear. Here, we show that D-serine competes with mitochondrial L-serine transport, thereby suppressing one-carbon metabolism. Metabolomic analysis revealed that D-serine reduces intracellular glycine and formate levels, indicating inhibition of the initial step of the one-carbon pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations and enzymatic assays revealed that D-serine has low affinity for serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (Shmt2), which catalyzes the first step in mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism, and does not directly inhibit its activity. Instead, membrane transport assays demonstrated that D-serine competes with mitochondrial L-serine transport, depleting the substrate of Shmt2. Functionally, under L-serine poor conditions in vitro and ex vivo, D-serine inhibited the proliferation of immature and undifferentiated neural cells including glioblastoma stem cells, which depend highly on one-carbon metabolism. Notably, endogenous D-serine levels were low during early neurodevelopment, but increased with maturation, coinciding with a shift in the transcriptional profiles of serine metabolic enzymes at the cellular level. Given that L-serine supports neurodevelopment and D-serine modulates neurotransmission, this developmental shift in serine enantiomer metabolism appears to align with the functional transitions of the maturing nervous system. Thus, our findings reveal that serine chirality can influence mitochondrial substrate availability and one-carbon flux, offering previously unappreciated insight into the stereoselective regulation of cellular metabolism.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, and immune dysregulation contribute to acute damage and long-term decline. Cortistatin, an immunomodulatory neuropeptide, has shown therapeutic benefit in acute stroke, though its endogenous role during onset and recovery remains unknown. Using an integrative approach combining transcriptomics from human and murine datasets, a preclinical stroke model, and tissue-level analysis in young and middle-aged mice, we demonstrated the causal and protective role of cortistatin during acute and subacute stroke phases. Our findings reveal that cortistatin deficiency increases stroke susceptibility and worsens outcomes. The lack of cortistatin triggers an amplified transcriptional response to ischemia, driving heightened neuroinflammation, glial dysfunction, compromising neurovascular integrity, and suppressing repair-associated pathways. Indeed, cortistatin levels were inversely associated with stroke severity. Notably, cortistatin deficiency accelerated aging-associated pathological features following stroke, underscoring its relevance in neuroimmune and cerebrovascular health. Administration of exogenous cortistatin reversed many detrimental effects, improving neuronal survival, mitigating immune dysregulation, preserving myelin, and promoting vascular recovery. Overall, cortistatin emerges as a key endogenous regulator of stroke pathophysiology and a promising multimodal therapy, supporting neuroimmune integrative approaches to tackle the multifaceted nature of stroke.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

We analyzed these quantitative measures alongside evaluating for qualitative EEG abnormalities ranging from slowing of activity to epileptiform patterns aiming to replicate the findings from the SPACE-BAMBI study (Bruining et al., 2020). EEG abnormalities were only identified in a few adults and could not be statistically assessed. ASD children-adolescents with EEG abnormalities exhibited lower relative alpha power and lower fE/I compared to children-adolescents without abnormalities; however, the EEG-abnormality scoring did not stratify the behavioral heterogeneity of ASD using clinical measures. Surprisingly, several controls presented with qualitative EEG abnormalities and showed a strikingly similar anatomical distribution of lower fE/I to the one observed in the ASD group, suggesting a shift towards inhibition-dominated network dynamics, in regions associated with altered sensory processing. The robustness of this association between EEG abnormalities and reduced fE/I was further supported by re-analysis of the SPACE-BAMBI study in source space.

Heterologousexpression of TaVIH2 in Arabidopsis thaliana showed enhanced drought tolerance by modulating the cell composition. In this study, we attempted to identify the interacting protein targets of wheat VIH2-3B using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library screen, identifying 52 putative interactors that are primarily involved in cell wall-related functions.

Herein, we describe a new Approach to Target Exact Nucleic Acid alternative structures (ATENA) that relies on the chemical conjugation of established G4 and iM ligands to a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9), enabling their individual targeting in living cells. ATENA demonstrated that the selective targeting of the G4 present in the oncogene c-MYC leads to the suppression of transcripts regulated exclusively by one of its promoters (P1). Conversely, targeting the c-MYC iMs on the opposite strand leads to the selective increase of P1-driven transcripts. ATENA revealed that G4-mediated transcriptional responses are highly ligand-specific, with different ligands eliciting markedly different effects at the same G4-site. We further demonstrated that the basal expression levels of the gene targeted can be used to predict the transcriptional impact associated with G4-stabilization.

MoPaDi combines self-supervised diffusion autoencoders with task-specific classifiers to manipulate images and flip predictions by altering visual features.

Furthermore, counterfactual images revealed interpretable, pathology-consistent morphological changes recognizable by experts. Conclusion: MoPaDi is a practical and extensible framework for counterfactual explanations generation in computational pathology. It enables interpretable, model-specific insight into what morphological changes drive classification outcomes, improving interpretability in clinical deep learning models.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Due to the complexity of this multifactorial disease, therapy options are still rather limited. We employed an in vitro pluripotent stem cell-based model to decipher potential disease-associated molecular pathways and to study the mode of action of prospective drugs. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) or Cluster of differentiation 26 (CD26) is involved in inflammation, infections, immune disorders, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease and cancer. Methods: We induced the steatosis phenotype in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) by oleic acid (OA)-feeding and confirmed regulation of clinically relevant pathways by NGS-based global transcriptomic analyses. Analysis of the secretome of steatotic HLCs revealed DPP4 as a potential key mediator of the disease. To further elucidate its role in the development of MAFLD, we inhibited DPP4 activity with Vildagliptin (VILDA) and analyzed the global transcriptome changes as well as specific gene and protein expression of steatosis-associated genes with and without DPP4 inhibition. Results: MAFLD-associated pathways such as PPAR- and TNF signaling were differentially regulated in hiPSC-derived steatotic HLCs. We found increased hepatic DPP4 activity and secretion upon OA. Gene expression of fatty acid and purine metabolism and inflammation-associated pathways were regulated upon DPP4 inhibition. Conclusions: Our HLC-model confirmed association of DPP4 with metabolism and inflammation which foster the development of MAFLD. Inhibiting DPP4 with VILDA partially relieved the steatotic phenotype on a global transcriptomic level.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

The SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleocapsid (N) protein is a stable, conserved and highly immunogenic that is less prone to mutation during infection, making it a key antigen in in vitro diagnosis, vaccine development, immunological and structural studies. While reports have focused on applying optimized N protein for different applications, the basic parameters used by different optimization tools for choosing the best approach for the N gene synonymous codon substitution are often neglected. Here, we analyzed the influence of different synonymous codon substitution strategies on SARS-CoV-2 N-protein expression in E. coli. Using different codon optimization (CO) and harmonization (CH) tools, we predicted and compared how parameters such as GC content, Codon Adaptation Index, codon quality and number of rare codons present in these sequences affect the N-protein expression. Our results also show that Minimum Free Energy (MFE) and RNA structure of N-term and C-tail of the N-protein coding sequence influence protein folding. We then predicted that the SR-rich region of the N-protein may contribute to slowing down the elongation rate during translation. This work presents a fundamental analysis of how different optimization tools affect SARS-CoV-2 N-protein expression and folding and suggests a basic approach to choosing the best strategy for optimal expression and folding of the protein for further studies.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

However, they are challenging to synthesize due to the ring strain associated with their small ring size. While chemical methods have been developed to access CTPs, they generally require the presence of certain amino acids, limiting their substrate scopes. Herein, we report the first bioinformatics-guided discovery of a thioesterase from a cryptic biosynthetic gene cluster for peptide cyclization. Specifically, we hypothesized that predicted penicillin-binding type thioesterases (PBP-TEs) from cryptic nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene clusters containing four adenylation domains would catalyze tetrapeptide cyclization. We found that one of the predicted PBP-TEs, WP516, efficiently cyclizes a wide variety of tetrapeptide substrates. To date, it is only the second stand-alone enzyme capable of cyclizing tetrapeptides, and its substrate scope greatly surpasses that of the only other reported tetrapeptide cyclase Ulm16. AlphaFold modeling, covalent docking, molecular dynamics, and mutational analyses were used to rationalize the broad substrate scope of WP516. Overall, the bioinformatics guided workflow outlined in this paper, and the discovery of WP516, represent promising tools for the biocatalytic production of head-to-tail CTPs, as well as a more general strategy for discovery of enzymes for peptide cyclization.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Adelges tsugae, hemlock woolly adelgid, was introduced from Japan and reproduces parthenogenetically in North America, where it has rapidly decimated Tsuga canadensis and Tsuga caroliniana (the eastern and Carolina hemlocks, respectively). Adelges abietis, eastern spruce gall adelgid, introduced from Europe, forms distinctive pineapple-shaped galls on several native spruce species. While not considered a major forest pest, it weakens trees and increases susceptibility to additional stressors. Broad-spectrum insecticides that are often used to control adelgid populations can have off-target impacts on beneficial insects. Whole genome sequencing was performed on both species to aid in development of targeted solutions that may minimize ecological impact. Adelges abietis was sequenced using Illumina Linked-Read technology from 30 pooled individuals, with Hi-C scaffolding performed using data from a single individual collected from the same host plant. Adelges tsugae used Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing from pooled nymphs. The assembled A. tsugae and A. abietis genomes, pooled from several parthenogenetic females, are 220.75 Mbp and 253.16 Mbp, respectively. Each consists of eight autosomal chromosomes, as well as two sex chromosomes (X1/X2), supporting the XX-XO sex determination system. The genomes are over 96% complete based on BUSCO assessment. Genome annotation identified 11,424 and 12,060 protein-coding genes in A. tsugae and A. abietis, respectively. Comparative analysis of proteins across 29 hemipteran species and 14 arthropod outgroups identified 31,666 putative gene families. Gene family evolution analysis with CAFE revealed lineage-specific expansions in immune-related aminopeptidases (ERAP1) and juvenile hormone binding proteins (JHBP), contractions in juvenile hormone acid methyltransferases (JHAMT), and conservation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). These genes were explored as candidate families towards a long-term objective of developing adelgid-selective insecticides. Structural comparisons of proteins across seven focal species (Adelges tsugae, Adelges abietis, Adelges cooleyi, Rhopalosiphum maidis, Apis mellifera, Danaus plexippus, and Drosophila melanogaster) revealed high conservation of nAChR and ERAP1, while JHAMT exhibited species-specific structural divergence.

The roles of land cover in impacting key water quality parameters (phosphorus , nitrogen, total suspended solids, bacteria, and conductivity) were investigated for the watershed of the North and South Fork of the Shenandoah River, Virginia. This area has a particularly sharp boundary between heavily forested and heavily agricultural regions. Two datasets were analyzed: 1) a large number of datapoints spanning a 20-year range in the Water Quality Portal (WQP) database, and 2) transects along three representative rivers systems over the span of a 4-year period. All parameters trended better in forested regions than agricultural regions. This was particularly true for nitrogen and conductivity; phosphorus, TSS and bacteria showed more local variability, especially in the agricultural region. Periods of high flow increased phosphorus, sediment and bacteria concentrations, and decreased conductivity, but not when drainage basin forest cover was less than 80%. Transects showed that waterways flowing out of forestland maintained higher water quality for approximately the first 8 km in agricultural land. Both transect and WQP data indicated higher water quality when the percent of forested land cover in a drainage basin was about 70-80%. Thus, forestland does mitigate the impacts of agriculture on water quality to some degree, but this effect rapidly diminishes as forest cover of the watershed lessens. Furthermore, forests themselves have degraded water quality at certain times and places; for instance, nutrients level were in the medium to high stress level for aquatic life in approximately 15% of samples. This study illustrates general trends of land cover effects on water quality, while also highlighting both site-specific variability, and the dynamics of water quality as water flows out of forested areas into agricultural areas.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Silencing mechanisms targeting TEs at the epigenetic or transcript level have independently evolved in many lineages. In fungi, repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) targets TEs by recognizing repetitive sequences and inducing mutagenesis. However, the prevalence of RIP across the fungal kingdom and the fidelity of the canonical C-to-T mutation signatures remain unclear. In this study, we address these gaps by tracking shifts in genome architecture across the fungal kingdom. We find that a striking ~30-fold increase in genome size within a clade of leotiomycetes is associated with the absence of several RIP-related genes, suggesting a relaxation of genome defense mechanisms during this expansion. To track the impact of genome defenses, we designed a quantitative screen for RIP-like mutation signatures. The phylum of ascomycetes was unique in showing enrichment in mutation signatures in non-coding and repetitive sequences, consistent with a phylogenetically restricted occurrence of RIP-like genome defense systems. Then, we performed a phylogeny-aware association study to identify gene functions associated with RIP-like mutation signatures. We identified a zinc-finger protein as the strongest candidate underpinning a novel mechanism of genome defenses. Our findings reveal the multifaceted drivers of genome defense systems and their close ties to genome size evolution in fungi, highlighting how proximate molecular mechanisms can shape genome evolution on deep phylogenetic scales.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

The ability of natural proteins to bind small molecule fragments in well-defined geometries has been widely evaluated using methods including crystallographic fragment screening. However, this approach had not been applied to de novo proteins. Here, we apply this method to explore the binding specificity of a de novo small molecule-binding protein ABLE. As in Nature, we found ABLE was capable of forming weak complexes, which were excellent starting points for designing entirely new functions, including a binder of a turn-on fluorophore and a highly efficient Kemp eliminase enzyme (kcat/KM = 2,200,000 M-1s-1) approaching the diffusion limit.

In many clinically important bacterial species, strains compete at multiple scales: at the between-host scale for new hosts to colonise, and at the within-host scale during co-colonisation. Characterising these multiple facets of competition plays an important role in understanding bacterial ecology. This is particularly relevant for antibiotic resistance, where competition between antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains determines resistance dynamics. In this work, we perform survival analyses on a large longitudinal dataset of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage to quantify how within-host competition affects the rates of clearance and establishment of pneumococcal strains. We find that the presence of a within-host competitor is associated with a 33% increase in clearance and a 54% reduction in establishment. Priority effects and serotype differences partially predict the outcomes of this within-host competition. Further, we quantify the effects of antibiotic resistance on between- and within-host components of fitness. Antibiotic consumption is associated with increased clearance rate for both susceptible and resistant strains, albeit to a higher extent in susceptible strains. In the absence of antibiotics, we find some evidence that resistance is associated with increased susceptibility to within-host competition, suggesting a fitness cost of resistance. Overall, our work provides quantitative insights into pneumococcal competition across scales and the role of this competition in shaping pneumococcal epidemiology.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

However, such methods demonstrate limited generalizability to real datasets with higher error rates and suffer from slow processing times when dealing with a large number of traces.

However, it presents a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of single-cell digital pathology data. Here, we introduce the application of Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size biomedical contexts. QCML enables the simulation of cognition-like learning for the identification of biologically meaningful prediction of chromosomal instability from CTC morphology, offering a novel tool for CTC classification in liquid biopsy.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

C.; Barua, B.; Baez-Cruz, F. A.; Winkelmann, D. A.; Goldman, Y. E.; Ostap, E. M.", "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of cardiac failure among individuals under 35. Many genetic mutations that cause HCM enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for beta-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to WT. This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin.ADP 5-fold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase Vmax 2-fold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed (SRX-DRX) regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosin's off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

S.; Carlon-Andres, I.; Simoncelli, S.; Padilla-Parra, S.; Ellero, M.; Moreno, N.", "abstract": "Enveloped viruses are characterized by spike proteins that protrude from and decorate the viral membrane. These proteins play a crucial role in host cell interactions and exhibit dynamic behaviors, such as tilting, sliding, and clustering, which vary across different types of enveloped viruses. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 spikes tilt to facilitate receptor binding, Influenza spikes migrate during infection, and HIV spikes migrate and cluster to enhance infectivity. In this study, we investigate how such dynamics influence the virus mobility. We characterize viral mobility through translational and rotational diffusion coefficients using a mesoscopic model that incorporates the dynamics of both the flexible spike proteins and the viral envelope. Using the smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) method, we construct three virion models with varying spike flexibility. The first is a fully rigid virus with static spikes, the second is a model with spikes that tilt but remain fixed in position, and the third is a model allowing both tilting and sliding of spikes across the envelope. Our results show that spike flexibility primarily affects rotational diffusion, whereas the envelope dominates translational mobility of the virus. We also explore spike clustering driven purely by hydrodynamic interactions and compare with an experimental model reference using DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging of HIV-like particles. We identify that hydrodynamic interactions alone can be responsible for dynamic clustering of spike proteins. Where, the characteristic size and lifespan of such clusters indicate predominantly doublets and triplets formations. Our findings highlight the role of spike dynamics in whole virion mobility, and motivate further investigations with time-resolved experimental evidence to fully characterize clustering behavior.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

We design different versions of the architecture and train and test them on simulations. We compare the results of one of our best models to the state-of-the-art approach codeml and find that it outperforms it when it is applied to data that resemble its training data, but that it performs less well when applied to data that does not resemble the training data.

In this study, we investigated the biological effects of nine most abundant, naturally occurring urinary COL(I)-derived peptides on human endothelial cells at physiological concentrations, using cell migration assays, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, flow cytometry, and AlphaFold3. While none of the peptides significantly altered endothelial migration by themselves at physiological concentrations, full-length COL(I) increased cell migration, which was inhibited by Peptide 1 (229NGDDGEAGKPGRPGERGPpGp249). This peptide uniquely contains the DGEA and GRPGER motifs, interacting with integrin 2{beta}1. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of integrin 2{beta}1 on human endothelial cells, and AlphaFold3 modelling predicted an interaction between Peptide 1 and integrin 2. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics investigating signalling pathways revealed that COL(I) triggered phosphorylation events linked to integrin 2{beta}1 activation and cell migration, which were absent in COL(I) plus peptide 1-treated cells. These findings identify Peptide 1 as a biologically active COL(I)-derived peptide at a physiological concentration capable of modulating collagen-induced cell migration, and provide a foundation for further investigation into its mechanisms of action and role in urine excretion.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

M.; Interlandi, G.; Carlucci, L. A.; Mollica, M. Y.; Janowska, M. K.; Thomas, W. E.; Sokurenko, E.; Klevit, R. E.", "abstract": "Bacterial adhesins such as FimH are critical for host colonization and persistence under the mechanical forces encountered at sites of infection such as the urinary tract. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms by which FimH--a key virulence factor of Escherichia coli--regulates its binding through conformational switching remain incompletely understood. FimH operates across a range of conformations that includes low- (LAS), intermediate-, high-affinity (HAS) states-- and forms catch bonds which paradoxically strengthen under force. The allosteric pathways governing these transitions remain poorly defined due to experimental limitations that restrict understanding of key dynamic phenomena that underlie ligand-triggered conformational shifts and force-induced long-lived interactions. Such understanding is central to drug discovery efforts to target bacterial adhesion. Here we present a model system that fully recapitulates the conformational repertoire of FimH in the absence of its pilin domain. Our findings demonstrate that a single mutation in the lectin domain induces the LAS while allowing for ligand-binding induced conformational change to the HAS and catch bond formation, mirroring the behavior of the native FimH adhesin. We propose a dynamic allosteric mechanism that involves ultra-slow, low-frequency dynamics for the ability of FimH and the bacteria that express it, to sustain long-lived interactions with mannose under both static and force conditions.\n\nSignificanceUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections, and their initiation depends on the ability of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to adhere to bladder cells. The adhesion is mediated by FimH, a protein on the outside of UPEC that binds mannose-containing glycoprotein receptors and strengthens its grip under shear stress via a catch-bond mechanism. To investigate FimH function, we engineered a variant that can adopt both low- and high-affinity states of FimH and can form catch bonds. We discovered that FimH is governed by ultra-slow conformational dynamics that vary even among structurally similar states. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for developing anti-adhesive therapies that target FimH dynamics, offering a novel strategy to prevent and treat UTIs.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

When Schistosoma mansoni infects its intermediate host, the Biomphalaria glabrata snail, early stress responses such as upregulation of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) are observed. We hypothesized that stress-induced Hsp70 localizes to the cell membrane and interacts with immune receptors such as siglec homologs to modulate the immune responses of the snail. We identified B. glabrata transcripts homologous to human and molluscan siglecs. Homology modelling of one siglec homolog (BgPrx) and Hsp70 (BgHsp70) was performed, followed by molecular docking, which predicted a salt bridge interaction between glutamic acid 479 on Hsp70 and lysine 47 on the siglec homolog. This in-silico finding suggests a plausible binding interface between these molecules. To validate this prediction, we examined the expression of several siglec homolog transcripts by real-time qPCR using RNA from susceptible (BB02) snails at multiple time points post-infection. Protein fractionation and immunocytochemistry were used to assess the subcellular localization of Hsp70. Results indicate that infection induces upregulation of siglec homolog transcripts and promotes membrane localization of Hsp70 in the snail. Together, these findings reveal that infection-induced membrane localization of Hsp70 coincides with siglec homolog upregulation, suggesting a potential interface for parasite-host immune interaction in B. glabrata. Understanding this interaction may provide new insight into immune modulation during early schistosome infection.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Resistance is often conferred by genes that are transferred horizontally among species and strains. However, for many bacteria, little is known about the genetic variation that potentiates resistance gene acquisition and accommodates acquired genes in the coadapted recipient genome. Results: Here we introduce a new bioinformatics genome-wide association study approach with Guided Omission of Linkage Disequilibrium (GOLD-GWAS) that masks covarying alleles explained by coinheritance and genome proximity to reveal genes where covarying sequence likely represents functional linkage between loci, consistent with epistasis. Analysing 806 Staphylococcus aureus isolate genomes, including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains, we identify genes that covary with the presence of the acquired staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) that houses the mecA resistance gene. Conclusions: Uncovering known and new gene-gene associations, we demonstrate how resistance can involve genetic coalitions beyond the well-known AMR genes.

While the hands-on experiments have been successful in fostering student interest and understanding of evolution, the downstream data analysis - interpreting whole-genome sequencing results of evolved yeast compared to the ancestor - remains a challenge. Students often struggle to grasp the significance of their mutated genes and lack the broader context to determine which mutations are most phenotypically relevant. To address these issues, we developed the yEvo Mutation Browser, an intuitive web tool designed to assist students and researchers alike in visualizing and contextualizing genome sequencing data. Developed using R Shiny, this tool features an interactive chromosome map displaying mutated genes, graphs categorizing mutation types, and a gene viewer illustrating specific mutation sites within genes. The app also features an option for non-yEvo-affiliated users to upload their own experimental evolution or genetic screen datasets and compare them with all yEvo data collected since 2018.

However, no study has investigated whether verbal instructions differentially influence older adults. Research question: This study investigated how walking prompts contribute to gait speed variability across age groups. Methods: Thirty-four young adults (21+- 2 years) and twenty-eight older adults (70+- 5 years) performed walking trials responding to 24 different instructions. Results: Average walking speed was 1.23+-0.30 m/s. Between-subject variance accounted for 25.3% of the total variance, while between subject and instruction variance components accounted for 76.1% of the total variance. When analyzed separately, variance due to instructions accounted for similar amounts of total variance within older adults (56.9%) and young adults (55.7%), a statistically non-significant difference (p = 0.85). A significant age-instruction interaction (X^2=84.13, df = 23. p<0.001) revealed that the age differences between average gait speed depended on which instruction was given. Complex instructions elicited the largest between group differences (B:-0.26 to -0.34 m/s), while simple tasks showed minimal differences (B:-0.05 to -0.07 m/s). Significance: Instructions explain similar variance within each age group (~56%), but the model treating instructions as fixed effects captures how different age groups respond to the same instructions. These findings highlight that gait assessment protocols should consider age-specific responses to verbal cues, as instructions that produce minimal between-group differences may be most appropriate for standardized clinical assessments across the lifespan.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we identified a functional connectivity (FC) signature, termed Alzheimer's-resilient connectome (ARC), that robustly differentiates SA from age-matched patients with AD. Using resting-state fMRI in a discovery cohort (N = 290), we identified ARC derived from machine learning classifiers that distinguished SA from AD with high accuracy (AUC = 0.85), and validated the replicability of the ARC in an independent replication cohort (N = 143). ARC involved prefrontal, temporal and insular networks and was strongly associated with brain age. When applied to cognitively unimpaired (CU) adults (discovery cohort: N = 818 and replication cohort: N = 497), ARC-based subtyping revealed SA-like and AD-like subgroups with similar baseline cognitive performance but markedly divergent longitudinal trajectories. SA-like CU individuals showed slower cognitive decline, reduced amyloid-{beta} accumulation, and lower risk of conversion to mild cognitive impairment and AD, reinforcing the ARC signature as a potential early indicator of resilience.

Many such immune responses have not been thoroughly examined and classified. The Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a community-based ontology in the domain of vaccinology. We here describe how VO is used to represent the variety of immune responses associated with vaccines, together with associated biomarkers and profiles. Results The VO differentiates 'vaccination' and 'vaccine immunization.' The former is a process of administering a vaccine in vivo; the latter is the outcome of vaccine induction of immune response. This distinction is critical for understanding both the procedure of vaccination and the resulting immune effects. VO also models and represents various vaccine-induced responses at multiple biological levels, including population, organism, organ/tissue, cell, and gene/protein levels. Such an approach captures the complexity of vaccine-induced immunity, from population-wide trend (for example: herd immunity) to molecular mechanisms. VO defines immune biomarkers as material entities such as neutralizing antibodies that signify humoral immune response, and IFN-gamma that is indicative of cell-mediated responses. Such biomarkers provide measurable indicators of the immune system's functional state post vaccination, enabling robust evaluation of vaccine efficacy. VO classifies 'immune response profile' and 'correlated profile (or correlate) of immune protection' as 'process profiles,' a class in the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO 2.0). Immune response profiles, such as 'Th1 (or Th2)-biased profile,' can be induced by various vaccines and vaccine adjuvants. Different types of 'correlated profile of immune protection are also identified, such as mechanistic and non-mechanistic correlates of immune protection. Such distinctions help us to quickly identify biomarkers and associated prediction and measurement of different kinds of vaccine protection. Conclusion The important immune-related terms for immune biomarkers, profiles, and responses are modeled ontologically in VO together with their interrelations. The results support enhanced classification and analysis of vaccine-induced immune responses and related biomarkers and immune profiles, leading to further understanding of the vaccine immune mechanisms and enhanced vaccine research and development.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

A high-fat, low-fiber western-type diet has been linked with inflammation, in part through gut microbiome changes. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a region with high HIV burden, urbanization has been linked with a shift from traditional agrarian towards westernized diets, and with changes in food security. To explore the relationship between diet, inflammation, and the gut microbiome in PLWH, we enrolled 1) ART Naive PLWH who provided samples before and after 24 weeks of ART, 2) PLWH on ART at both timepoints and 3) HIV-seronegative controls. Individuals were evenly recruited from rural and urban Zimbabwe (locations were 145 kilometers/90 miles apart). Using a food frequency survey designed to measure intake of agrarian versus western-type food items in Zimbabwe, we determined how diet differs with urbanization, HIV-infection and treatment, and is related to inflammation and the gut microbiome. Results: Individuals residing in a rural area of Zimbabwe less frequently consumed high-fat, low-fiber western type food items and had lower consumption of diverse food items overall, except for sadza- a subsistence staple- processed from home-grown grains. Consumption of a more western-type diet correlated with lower CD4+ T cell percentage in untreated and treated PLWH and with increased T cell exhaustion in PLWH on ART. PLWH on ART at time of enrollment also consumed diverse food items at a lower frequency and more often were underweight. Low food consumption correlated with muted improvements in T cell exhaustion after 24 weeks of ART.

We report an inexpensive, colorimetric spoilage sensor for real-time food product assessment. The sensor is composed of dehydrated gelatin microneedles that exhibit high mechanical integrity in their base state. However, once exposed to fluid-rich food environments, they rapidly transition to a hydrogel sensing state. Food-derived anthocyanins embedded within these microneedles enable pH-based spoilage monitoring. When applied to sealed fish products, these microneedles non-destructively penetrate through packaging and are rehydrated by the underlying fish matrix. As the product ages, a defined colour shift occurs, demonstrating strong correlation with quantitative spoilage markers. When applied to unsealed fish products for rapid testing, the large microneedle sensing interface enables accelerated colorimetric sensing. Finally, successful fresh versus spoiled categorization of smartphone-acquired images of the sensor using machine learning removes readout ambiguity, empowering consumers with independent real-time product monitoring.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Unfortunately, conventional PCR offers limited multiplexing capability due to issues like primer interference, fluorescence spectral overlaps and instrumentation complexity. Solid-phase PCR (SP-PCR), in which primers are physically separated on a solid support, has emerged as an alternative strategy for detection of multiple targets in parallel. However, SP-PCR has been suffering from low efficiency, long reaction time, inability for real-time signal monitoring and accurate quantification, which greatly restricts their applications in multiplexed assays. In this study, we presented for the first time a compact and portable flow-through SP-PCR platform to permit rapid, highly efficient and quantitative solid-phase amplification. We designed an integrated platform comprising a novel mechanically actuated valving system and a dual-chamber SP-PCR system to enable automated sample purification and amplification. Active oscillating the PCR solution between the chambers significantly enhanced the mass diffusion over the solid-phase array. Moreover, after each amplification cycle, the PCR solution was separated from the solid-phase-bound probes, thereby eliminating background signal interference and allowing for real-time monitoring of SP-PCR signals without the need for complex optical systems. The flow-through SP-PCR system demonstrated quantitative detection of five viral pathogens in a single reaction, with a limit of detection of 10 copies per reaction within 20 minutes. This platform provides a promising high-throughput, low-cost and simple-instrumentation multiplexed diagnostic system.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Through complementary multi-modal omic approaches, including single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, trajectory inference, clonal lineage reconstruction, and gene expression and regulatory network analyses, we systematically dissected the molecular diversity and ontogenesis of cerebellar astrocytes. We identified known types and uncovered new subtypes with functional specialization, inferring their developmental trajectories from multiple embryonic niches and postnatal progenitor sources with fate divergence, convergence, and restriction. We further predicted a hierarchical transcriptional regulator code governing this diversification, operating at multiple levels: distinct regulatory modules i) reflect embryonic regionalization and lineage; ii) determine broad astroglial identity; specify iii) Bergmann versus non-Bergmann fates; and guide iv) astrocyte type and v) subtype acquisition. Our findings map and temporally organize transcriptional programs that capture key determinants of astrocyte fate, integrating them along defined trajectories toward diverse astrocyte identities.

The evolutionary origins of cortical/pallial control over vocal learning abilities in mammals and songbirds remains largely unknown. For instance, reports conflict on whether the cerebral cortex contributes, in any way, to vocal communication in vocal non-learning mice. Physiological studies in adult mice have shown that regions of the motor cortex have roles in modulation of vocalizations in mice, yet, genetic ablation of the cerebral cortex reportedly has minimal, if any, impact on mouse vocal behavior. Re-analysis of adult acortical mice revealed that deep learning machine classifiers could distinguish mutant ultrasonic vocalizations from wildtypes. However, the specific acoustic features underlying these differences were not identified. Here, we investigated isolation calls of acortical mouse pups using statistical analysis of acoustic features and playback experiments to determine whether mutants lacking a cerebral cortex have altered vocal development. We find that a subset of acoustic features differ between acortical and wildtype pup vocalizations and that these differences are indicative of distress. Moreover, call bouts of acortical pups have lower informational complexity that are more comparable to random probability sampling. Playbacks indicate that dams preferentially approach vocalizations of acortical pups. Our analyses provide evidence that the murine cerebral cortex influences development of complex vocal behaviors, suggesting mice can be used to gain useful insights into the foundations of vocal learning.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Wnt/beta-catenin signaling drives osteogenic vs chondrogenic differentiation and must be tightly controlled during the differentiation of osteochondroprogenitors. Chromatin remodelers add hierarchal regulation to the activation and repression of crucially timed gene regulatory networks and signaling cascades. In this study, we investigated the function of two chromatin remodelers, histone methyltransferases, PRDM3 and PRDM16 during murine craniofacial development. Conditionally ablating both Prdm3 and Prdm16 in the neural crest lineage using the Wnt1-Cre driver resulted in dramatic craniofacial phenotypes, including a severely hypoplastic mandible with complete absence of Meckel's cartilage at E18.5. Focusing on the Meckel's cartilage and mandibular bone phenotype, histological analysis demonstrated a significant increase in RUNX2+ osteoblast precursors, and loss of SOX9+ chondrogenic cells, suggesting an increase in osteoblast progenitors at the expense of chondrocytes that would otherwise form the Meckel's cartilage. This was not due to alterations in proliferation or apoptosis, as we observed no significant changes in the number of phosphoH3+ or cleaved caspase3+ cells in the mandibular process at E11.5, suggesting lack of NCC-derived chondrocytes is due to a change in NCC osteochondroprogenitor fate decisions. mRNA transcripts and protein abundance of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling components were elevated in the mandibular process during initial NCC osteochondroprogenitor condensation events, suggesting PRDM3 and PRDM16 normally restrict expression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling components during NCC-derived osteochondroprogenitor differentiation to promote chondrogenesis and Meckel's cartilage formation. Taken together, PRDM3 and PRDM16 are required for NCC differentiation toward chondrocytes during Meckel's cartilage formation by controlling proper spatiotemporal Wnt/beta-catenin transcriptional activity and this process is necessary for morphogenesis of the developing mandible.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art atomic simulations can capture binding events and provide new molecular insight. By using the bacterial model protein HU, we link existing crystal structures to the search and recognition states. We find that weak contacts mediated by only a few positively charged residues enable initial binding, followed by facilitated diffusion and transient rolling on DNA. Extended arms in the HU structure serve as antennae to search for DNA, permitting intrasegmental hops and intersegmental jumps. The transition to specific binding only occurs at the DNA target site, helped by its bendability, indicating a concerted binding mechanism between the protein and DNA. We observe a lack of direct binding to the most positively charged area, which is hidden behind HU's arms and defines the recognition state. This prevents the protein from being trapped in random DNA. Instead, the multi-step binding process found here ensures that the high-affinity complex only occurs at the target position.

Inhibiting Hh signaling, either genetically or pharmacologically, results in an expanded IFT population. In contrast, reducing Bmp signaling decreases the number of IFT cardiomyocytes, while increasing Bmp signaling leads to an excess of IFT cardiomyocytes. Temporal inhibition of each pathway reveals that Hh and Bmp signaling act before myocardial differentiation to regulate IFT size. Simultaneous reduction of both Hh and Bmp signaling yields a relatively normal number of IFT cardiomyocytes, suggesting that these pathways function antagonistically during IFT development. Additionally, epistasis analysis suggests that Bmp signaling acts upstream of Wnt signaling to promote IFT formation, whereas Hh signaling limits IFT size in a Wnt-independent manner. Our results support a model in which Hh signaling restricts the establishment of the IFT progenitor pool, while Bmp signaling drives IFT progenitor specification prior to Wnt-directed IFT differentiation.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Rather, the sleep-onset period (SOP) exhibits dynamic and non-monotonous changes of electroencephalogram (EEG) with high, and so far poorly understood, intra- and inter-individual variability. Computational models of the sleep regulation network have suggested that the transition to sleep can be viewed as a noisy bifurcation at a saddle point which is determined by an underlying control signal or ``sleep drive''. However, such models do not describe how internal control signals in the SOP can produce rapid switches between stable wake and sleep states, nor how these state-space changes are translated in the macroscopic EEG. Here, we propose a minimally-parameterized stochastic dynamical model, in which one slowly-varying control parameter drives the wake-to-sleep transition while exhibiting noise-driven bistability. We provide a procedure for estimating the parameters of the model given single observations of experimental sleep EEG data, and show that it can reproduce a wide variety of SOP phenomenology. Using the model to analyze a pre-existing sleep EEG dataset, we find that the estimated model parameters correlate with subjective sleepiness reports. These results suggest that the bistable characteristics of the SOP can serve as biomarkers for tracking intra- and inter-individual variability of sleep-onset disorders.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Although Spag6 knockout mice (Spag6-/-) are phenotypically normal, the surviving Spag6l-/- males are infertile. To further investigate the roles of SPAG6 and SPAG6L, we generated compound mutants by crossing the two knockout lines. Compound heterozygous Spag6+/-; Spag6l+/- mice are fertile, while all Spag6-/-; Spag6l+/- males are infertile despite grossly normal appearance. Histological and ultrastructural analyses revealed defective spermiogenesis, including abnormal chromatin condensation, malformed acrosome and manchette, and disorganized mitochondrial and fibrous sheath. Both SPAG6 and SPAG6L bind to SPINK2, a key regulator of acrosome function, but SPAG6 has an approximately 10-fold higher binding affinity than SPAG6L. Moreover, SPAG6 modulates testicular AKAP4 and SPAG16L levels, which are critical components of the fibrous sheath and central apparatus respectively. Notably, SPAG6 suppresses tubulin acetylation, whereas SPAG6L enhances this post-translational modification, suggesting antagonistic roles in microtubule assembly.

The genomes of living amphioxus thus can help to reveal the genetic basis shaping the evolutionary transition from invertebrates to vertebrates. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the genome architecture in amphioxus, here we generate a chromosome-anchored genome assembly for Asymmetron lucaynum, representing the earliest diverging cephalochordate genus. Our results show that Asymmetron has an enlarged genome compared to those of the other four cephalochordate genomes decoded so far (all in the genus Branchiostoma), causing by pervasive expansions of inter-genic transposable elements (TEs). Nevertheless, both macrosynteny and microsynteny remain highly conserved between Asymmetron and Branchiostoma, enabling reconstruction of the ancestral genomic architecture of the Cephalochordate lineage for tracing genome evolutionary process during Deuterostome and Chordate diversification. By coupling developmental transcriptomic analyses, we further show that purifying selection and constraints on co-transcriptional regulation may have contributed to the maintenance of the conserved microsynteny blocks among cephalochordate species. We also examine the evolutionary history of Hox cluster in cephalochordates and vertebrates, and identify species-specific inversions and TE invasions at this important locus in both Asymmetron and Branchiostoma. Finally, we survey key gene families involved in both innate and adaptive immunity (e.g., TLR, NLR, MHC, and RAG) and uncover their plausible ancestry and evolutionary dynamics in chordates. Taken together, our findings illuminate the genome and gene evolution of cephalochordates and provide valuable resources for understanding the early evolution of chordates and the origin of vertebrates.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Structure-function analysis reveals that Orb2 RNA-binding activity promotes brain growth, while its poly-Q and ZZ domains act to restrain overgrowth.

In the developing adrenal gland, we uncover a neurovascular mechanism that actively establishes and preserves compartment boundaries between cortex and medulla. Peripheral nerves secrete Semaphorin3C, signaling through PlexinD1 on endothelial cells to locally antagonize VEGF-driven angiogenesis from cortical cells, sculpting distinct vascular domains that guide hormone-producing cells to their correct territories. Disruption of this balance -via denervation or loss of Semaphorin3C-PlexinD1 signaling- leads to ectopic vascularization of the medulla, which adopts a cortex-like vascular network. This vascular remodeling enables cortical cells invasion of medullary territories, blurring compartment boundaries and triggering a phagocytic macrophage response that reflects pathological hijacking of a postnatal morphogenesis program. Our findings reveal that region-specific vascular scaffolds, shaped by neurovascular cues, serve as instructive templates for organ architecture. Failure of neurovascular signaling can thus trigger a cascade of structural collapse that undermines tissue integrity and homeostasis, driving pathological remodeling.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Despite its fundamental importance in neurovascular biology, including as a drug target, the molecular mechanisms governing FZD4 regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we employed proximity biotinylation to identify proteins that regulate FZD4. We identified ATPase Plasma Membrane Ca2+ Transporting 1 (ATP2B1, also known as PMCA1) as a FZD4 proximity interactor. Functional analyses revealed that ATP2B1 depletion increased EC Ca2+ and significantly attenuated Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling. These effects of Atp2b1 deficiency were recapitulated by ionomycin-mediated elevation of intracellular Ca2+; and suppressed by inhibition of calcineurin/NFAT signaling. Endothelial-specific Atp2b1 deletion caused retinal vascular defects consistent with compromised Norrin/Frizzled4 signaling. In the developing brain, WNT7A/B pathway LOF phenotypes in Gpr124 KO mice were exacerbated by additional deletion of Atp2b1 in ECs. This study identifies ATP2B1 as a novel regulator of Norrin- and WNT7A/B-induced FZD4 signaling and suggests that in pathological contexts with elevated EC Ca2+-levels, EC function may be modulated by suppression of {beta}-catenin-dependent signaling.

Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids provide a powerful alternative for the study of embryonic morphogenesis. However, screening for genetic drivers of morphogenesis in vitro has been infeasible due to organoid variability and the high costs of performing scaled tissue-wide single-gene perturbations. By overcoming both these limitations, we developed a platform that integrates reproducible organoid morphogenesis with uniform single-gene perturbations, enabling high-throughput arrayed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screening in hPSC-derived organoids. To demonstrate the power of this platform, we screened 77 transcription factors in an organoid model of anterior neurulation to identify ZIC2, SOX11, and ZNF521 as essential regulators of neural tube closure. We discovered that ZIC2 and SOX11 are required for closure, while ZNF521 prevents ectopic closure points. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of perturbed organoids revealed co-regulated gene targets of ZIC2 and SOX11 and an opposing role for ZNF521, suggesting that these transcription factors jointly govern a gene regulatory program driving neural tube closure in the anterior forebrain region.

Leveraging the transparency and genetic tractability of larval zebrafish, we developed an assay using odorless, alginate-encapsulated particles designed to release nutrients after consumption. Using this approach, we demonstrated that larval EECs regulate nutrient-specific feeding. To determine how these post-ingestive signals are encoded, we developed a microgavage method enabling simultaneous stimulus delivery to the gut and volumetric two-photon calcium imaging. We found that gut distension alone drove widespread activation and suppression in vagal ganglia and dorsal hindbrain, emerging as a dominant enteric signal in early development. Although nutrient-evoked responses shared temporal features with distension, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), an aversive compound found in wasabi, elicited distinct neural dynamics with slow onset.

Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated gpr132b mutants and found that they exhibit enhanced wound healing following sterile injury but increased susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infection, indicating that GPR132b modulates a trade-off between wound repair and antimicrobial defense. The enhanced regrowth phenotype was associated with increased macrophage accumulation at the wound site and reduced basal expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-.

The HF diet increased the adipocyte area in all adipose tissues, hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and liver steatosis scores. In BAT, it increased the number of unilocular adipocytes; upregulated Ppargc1a, Ucp1, Vegfa, Vegfr2, and Il10 mRNA levels; and downregulated Acaca and Fasn mRNA levels. In iWAT, it elevated Vegfr2 and Slc2a4 mRNA levels and carbonyl content, and reduced lipid peroxidation and Ucp1 mRNA and protein levels. In eWAT, it upregulated Slc2a4, and downregulated Acaca, Fasn, Prkaa1, and Prkaa2 mRNA levels. The HF+ diet reduced the adipocyte area; unilocular adipocytes; and Acaca, Fasn, and Il10 mRNA levels in BAT. Coffee decreased catalase activity in BAT independent of diet type. In iWAT, the HF+ diet reduced adipocyte area and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, while increasing the number of multilocular adipocytes, Prdm16 and Vegfr2 mRNA levels, and UCP1 protein. Catalase activity decreased with coffee intake, regardless of diet type. In eWAT, coffee increased multilocular adipocytes and Prdm16 mRNA levels, and decreased Fasn mRNA, independent of diet type. Coffee combined with the control diet increased Ppargc1a and liver steatosis scores, while decreasing Acaca and Vegfr2 mRNA levels and catalase and GPx activities compared to those with the control diet. Overall, coffee consumption at levels comparable to the typical Brazilian intake partially mitigated BAT whitening, likely through the modulation of lipogenic and lipolytic gene expression.

However, the morphogenetic processes underlying nephrogenesis can vary significantly across species and various kinds of kidneys. The Xenopus larval kidney, the pronephros, is a non-integrated nephron where plasma filtrates are first release into a coelomic compartment, the nephrocoel, before being released into the tubular compartment through ciliated funnels called nephrostome. Mechanisms of pronephros morphogenesis, especially the potential role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) remain poorly understood. This study investigates the role of the ECM component versican (vcan) in the development of the pronephric kidney in X. laevis, paying a special attention to non-integrated nephron features, the glomus, nephrocoel and nephrostomes. Vcan is dynamically expressed in the ECM surrounding the developing tubule and the podocyte layer of the glomus, with a transient presence in the differentiating podocyte-region prior to the formation of the concave podocyte pocket accumulating {beta}1-integrin. Morpholino depletion of vcan causes a fusion of the proximal tubule branches without affecting the nephrostomes. Tubules become dilated and lose their proximal circumvolutions. More strikingly, vcan depletion results in a severe disruption of glomus morphogenesis, the podocyte layer failing to form its characteristic C-shaped structure. Despite normal expression of the differentiation markers nphs2 in podocytes, {beta}1-integrin fails to accumulate in the podocyte layer in vcan-depleted embryos. Interestingly, other ECM components, including fibrillin, laminin, and fibronectin, remain correctly localized, suggesting that the defect is not due to a general ECM disorganization. These findings reveal that transient vcan expression is critical for podocytes layer morphogenesis, likely by enabling {beta}1-integrin accumulation and subsequent cell-ECM interactions necessary for structural assembly.

The craniofacial and dental manifestation of Robinow syndrome is heterogenous, as is the effect of altered Wnt5a in animal models. The relationship between Wnt5a and craniofacial and dental phenotypes is not fully understood. Methods: To investigate the role of Wnt5a in craniofacial and dental development, we utilized a Wnt5a conditional loss-of-function (LOF: Wnt5afl/fl;Ctskcre) and a Wnt5a conditional gain-of-function (GOF: Rosa26-LSL-Wnt5a;Ctskcre) model to determine the effect of both LOF and GOF of Wnt5a in bone cells during craniofacial and dental development. Postnatal day 10 conditional LOF Wnt5a, GOF Wnt5a, and control skulls were scanned by micro-computed tomography and assessed using traditional and geometric morphometrics. Mandibular bone apoptosis was further assessed by TUNEL staining. Results: Conditional Wnt5a LOF resulted in midface hypoplasia, increased maxillary intermolar width, increased rostral basisphenoid width, and delayed molar eruption. Wnt5a LOF mandibles did not have altered bone mineral density or bone microarchitecture unlike our previous study examining Wnt5a LOF femurs. In contrast, conditional Wnt5a GOF results in macrocephaly, shortened hard palate, increased zygomatic length, micrognathia, and mandibular process morphology changes. The micrognathia and mandibular process morphology changes in the Wnt5a GOF mice were not due to increased apoptosis. A partially penetrant snout deviation was present in both the Wnt5a LOF and GOF mice. Conclusions: Craniofacial and dental phenotype differed between mice with conditional GOF and LOF of Wnt5a, consistent with the craniofacial phenotype heterogeneity in Wnt5a-associated Robinow syndrome. We detected tooth eruption delay, mandibular condyle dysmorphology, and facial asymmetry in mice with altered Wnt5a that have not been previously reported in patients. Our data suggest precise regulation of Wnt5a is essential for proper craniofacial and dental development.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

T.; Adams, J.; Richards, Z.; Campbell, K.", "abstract": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are essential for morphogenesis, converting static epithelial cells into migratory mesenchymal cells. As EMT disrupts epithelial barriers, its timing must be tightly regulated during development. We investigated this regulation in the Drosophila posterior embryonic midgut, where the GATA transcription factor Serpent (Srp) drives a collective partial EMT in the principal midgut epithelial cells (PMECs). Srp is expressed well before PMEC-EMT initiation and is also required for an earlier event: the specification and delamination of endoblasts, which give rise to different midgut lineages including adult midgut progenitors (AMPs). Here we identify the steroid hormone ecdysone as a temporal cue that triggers PMEC-EMT. Although Srp activates and represses numerous genes during early stages of midgut development, including polarity regulators such as crumbs (crb), the removal of polarity proteins and E-Cadherin from the membrane of PMECs only properly occurs in the presence of ecdysone signalling. This suggests that Srp primes cells transcriptionally for EMT, which proceeds only once polarity and adhesion proteins are downregulated post-translationally. Accordingly, premature ecdysone exposure induces an early EMT, in a Srp-dependent manner. Furthermore, early PMEC-EMT leads to a reduction in the number of progenitor cells, suggesting that maintaining epithelial integrity until after endoblasts are selected is crucial for early fate decisions. These findings reveal that ecdysone functions as a EMT gatekeeper, ensuring that EMT is temporally restricted to occur only after progenitor specification, and in coordination with other developmental processes. More broadly, our work shows that in this context, transcriptional priming of EMT can be uncoupled from its execution, which is post-translationally triggered by hormonal signals. Given the conserved role of nuclear steroid hormone receptors as GATA co-factors and their association with poor prognosis in cancer, this may represent a broader strategy by which systemic cues regulate EMT in development and cancer.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Numerous experimental and computational studies exist to characterize the mechanical behavior of arterial tissue samples under controlled laboratory conditions. However, translating this laboratory knowledge into physiologically realistic and real-life conditions remains challenging. Key difficulties include the selection of suitable and physiologically relevant test methods, minimizing measurement uncertainty, and ensuring robust model validation. Here, we present a novel integrative approach to translate controlled laboratory experiments on arterial samples into pressure diameter data that can be recorded inexpensively and non-invasively in the clinic. We perform controlled planar-biaxial tests on carotid arteries under three different stretch ratios and generate axial and circumferential stress-stretch data to calibrate a fiber-reinforced soft tissue model for arterial tissue. Using an analytical thick-walled cylindrical model, we predict subject-specific pressure-diameter behavior, informed by anatomical geometries and arterial prestretch. We systematically compare each prediction against extension-inflation experiments on tubes from the same artery by applying controlled pairs of axial stretch and inner pressure, while recording the outer diameter. We quantify the prediction error in both absolute and relative stretch regimes. The results show that planar-biaxial loading probes fundamentally different stretch regimes compared to extension-inflation deformations, leading to an extrapolation of the model predictions. We quantify the influence of the fitted constitutive material parameters, and assess the sensitivity of the results to the accurate representation of axial stretch and circumferential prestretch. We suggest that translating laboratory measurements into realistic physiological conditions is also highly sensitive to the load-free reference configuration and in vivo geometries. Only when those key model parameters are accurately captured, and their uncertainty propagated, planar-biaxial stress-stretch data can be used as a reliable tool to predict arterial pressure-diameter behavior.

While cytokine-based priming methods, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) stimulation, have shown promise in enhancing MSC potency, alternative approaches targeting distinct biological metabolism integral to secretome and membrane architecture have not been explored in MSCs. In this study, we investigate sphingomyelinase (SMase), an enzyme that generates ceramide from sphingomyelin, as a novel lipid-based priming strategy to modulate MSC function. Here, human MSCs were treated with SMase and high-content imaging and morphological profiling revealed that SMase-treated cells adopted a phenotype overlapping with IFN{gamma}-licensed MSCs, including increased cell compactness and solidity. Lipidomic analysis showed broad alterations in sphingolipid species, and dynamic flux estimation (DFE) modeling predicted distinct metabolic shifts in SMase-treated cells compared to untreated controls. These changes were sustained up to 35 hours post-stimulation, indicating stable metabolic reprogramming. SMase priming also altered the MSC secretome, enriching for factors implicated in immune regulation. Functionally, SMase-primed MSCs retained the ability to suppress T-cell activation and promote anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotypes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that SMase stimulation induces a durable, immunomodulatory-like state in MSCs through coordinated changes in lipid metabolism and secretory activity.

Characterization of protein glycosylation is among one of the most challenging problems in proteomics due to the high heterogeneity of glycosites and glycan structures. Recently, deep learning has been adopted to predict N-glycopeptide tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra and exhibited a promising effect in N-glycoproteomics. However, current deep learning frameworks struggle to accurately predict O-glycopeptide MS/MS spectra due to the complexity of O-glycopeptides and the limited availability of training data. In this study, we introduce DeepGPO, a deep learning framework for the prediction of both N- and O-glycopeptide MS/MS spectra. The DeepGPO incorporates a Transformer module alongside two graph neural network (GNN) modules specifically designed for handling branched glycans. To address the issue of data scarcity in O-glycoproteomics datasets, various training methods are adopted in DeepGPO, such as the introduction of training weights for different MS/MS spectra and the adoption of pre-training strategies. DeepGPO exhibits accurate prediction of N- and O-glycopeptides MS/MS spectra. With the predicted MS/MS, glycosylation sites can be localized even in the absence of site-determining ions, for instance using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) for the localization of O-glycosylation. We also explored the possibility of differentiating O-glycosites and N-glycosites using the predicted MS/MS spectra. DeepGPO primarily addresses mono-glycosylated peptides and is capable of handling doubly glycosylated peptides, but it currently cannot process peptides with three or more glycan modifications due to limited training data and increased spectral complexity.

This high chemokine production in MSI CRCs is due to constitutive activation of the cytosolic DNA (cyDNA) sensor STING by specific features of MSI cyDNA that lead to more effective STING pathway activation. Here, we investigate the features of MSI and CIN cyDNA to identify structures that more effectively activate STING. We find that MSI cyDNA is enriched in Gquadruplexes which improve STING and CD8+ T cell activation. Additionally, MSI micronuclei are also more efficient at inducing chemokine expression than CIN micronuclei. However, micronuclei are less effective than free cyDNA at inducing anti-tumor immunity and instead lead to increased Treg activation and IL10 production.

Methods: Whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing were performed on paired tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 23 consented patients treated at two Kenyan referral hospitals. Variants were called with Mutect2 using a study-specific panel of normals; functional consequences were annotated with VEP. After featureCounts quantification, differential expression was analyzed in DESeq2 (fold-change [&ge;] 1.5, p < 0.05). Two-sample t-tests (mutations) and ANOVA (expression) evaluated relationships with HER2 status and clinical stage. Results: A total of 358 somatic mutations were detected: 170 in ZNF217, 24 in ZNF703 and 164 in ZNF750. Single-nucleotide substitutions (319 SNPs) dominated, with C[-&gt;]T and A[-&gt;]G changes most common; 27 deletions and 2 insertions were also observed. Frameshift events in ZNF217 and ZNF703 introduced premature stop codons predicted to truncate protein function. All three genes were significantly up-regulated in tumors versus normals (ZNF217 p = 0.0004), with the greatest expression in HER2-positive tumors and in stages 2-3 disease. Mutation burden for each gene did not differ by HER2 status (p > 0.56) or by stage (p > 0.32). Conclusions: Kenyan breast tumors harbor frequent, functionally relevant mutations and marked over-expression of ZNF217, ZNF703, and ZNF750.

While dysregulation of this process is implicated in numerous neurological disorders, the precise mechanisms by which astrocytes guide synapse formation and maturation remain poorly understood. A central signaling pathway for astrocytes is the dynamic fluctuation of intracellular calcium (Ca2+), which can arise from various sources and modulate a wide range of downstream effects. A key astrocytic mechanism for integrating neuronal signals is the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores mediated by the IP3 Receptor Type 2 (IP3R2). Although defects in this signaling pathway have been mainly linked to adult brain dysfunction, its role in shaping synaptic development, a period when astrocyte-neuronal communication is established, is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of IP3R2-mediated Ca2+ signaling in astrocyte-dependent regulation of synapse development in the mouse visual cortex. Using a combination of histological, molecular, and circuit-level approaches, we found that loss of astrocytic IP3R2 leads to significant deficits in the maturation of glutamatergic but not GABAergic synapses. These synaptic disruptions were accompanied by attenuated visually evoked neuronal activation and impaired behavioral responses to visual threat stimuli. We further show that astrocytic morphological complexity is diminished in the absence of IP3R2, suggesting that store-released Ca2+ is required for both the structural and functional maturation of astrocyte-neuron interactions.

However, the role of astrocyte-mediated communication has been largely underappreciated. While astrocytes communicate with one another through gap junctions, the extent and specificity of this communication remain poorly understood. Astrocyte gap junctions are necessary for memory formation, synaptic plasticity, coordination of neuronal signaling, and closing the visual and motor critical periods. These findings indicate that this form of communication is essential for proper central nervous system development and function. Despite their significance, studying astrocyte gap junctional networks has been challenging. Current methods like slice electrophysiology disrupt network connectivity and introduce artifacts due to tissue damage. To overcome these limitations, we developed a vector-based approach that labels molecules as they are fluxed by astrocyte gap junctions in awake, behaving animals. We then used whole-brain tissue clearing to image these intact, three-dimensional astrocyte networks. We show that multiple astrocyte networks traverse the mouse brain. These networks selectively connect specific regions, rather than diffusing indiscriminately, and vary in size and organization. We observe local networks are confined to single brain regions and long-range networks robustly interconnecting multiple regions across hemispheres, often exhibiting patterns distinct from known neuronal networks. Further, we demonstrate that astrocyte networks undergo structural reorganization in adult brain following sensory deprivation.

Visual working memory and auditory working memory recruit different networks, which include posterior sensory cortices and multiple sensory-biased regions interleaved across frontal cortex. Additionally, a fronto-parietal network of supramodal regions is robustly recruited by working memory in both modalities. Here we examined functional connectivity among visual-biased, auditory-biased, and supramodal working memory networks by collecting fMRI data from 24 human participants (aged 18-43; 11 men and 13 women). Replicating and extending prior work from our laboratory (Tobyne et al., 2017; Noyce et al., 2022), resting-state fMRI (N=18) analysis revealed that the visual-biased WM network exhibits stronger functional connectivity with supramodal regions than does the auditory-biased network. These findings point to a potential functional asymmetry between visual and auditory working memory mechanisms; visual cognition may have more direct access to supramodal WM brain structures. Therefore, we hypothesized that auditory working memory task performance would evoke more robust changes in functional connectivity than would visual working memory task performance. To test this hypothesis, we examined changes in functional connectivity that occur when participants (N=21) perform visual or auditory working memory tasks equated for difficulty. Auditory working memory produced substantial network changes that increased the connectivity of the auditory-biased network to supramodal regions and visual-biased frontal regions. At the same time, connectivity from posterior visual areas to supramodal and frontal visual regions decreased. In contrast, the visual task produced more modest changes in functional connectivity. Moreover, we observed that the strength of auditory-biased network connectivity changes correlated with subject behavioral performance on the auditory task, with higher working memory precision observed in participants with greater connectivity changes. Therefore, the visual working memory network appears to have more robust connectivity to supramodal working memory cortical structures at rest, but during auditory working memory, dynamic network changes permit the auditory working memory network to increase connectivity to the supramodal and frontal visual working memory networks.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

If such short mRNA half-lives persisted in mitosis, cells would be expected to quickly deplete their transcriptome in the absence of new transcription. Here, we report that the transcriptome is globally stabilized during prolonged mitotic delays. Typical mRNA half-lives are increased >4-fold in mitosis compared to interphase, thereby buffering mRNA levels in the absence of new synthesis. Moreover, the poly(A)-tail-length profile of mRNAs changes in mitosis, strongly suggesting a mitotic repression of deadenylation.

J.; scarcelli, G.; Yu, H.; Lammerding, J.", "abstract": "Lamins are nuclear intermediate filament proteins with diverse functions, ranging from organizing chromatin and regulating gene expression to providing structural support to the nucleus. Mammalian cells express two types of lamins, A-type and B-type, which, despite their similar structure and biochemical properties, exhibit distinct differences in expression, interaction partners, and function. One major difference is that A-type lamins have a significantly larger effect on the mechanical properties of the nucleus, which are crucial for protecting the nucleus from cytoskeletal forces, enabling cell migration through confined spaces, and contributing to cellular mechanotransduction. The molecular mechanism underlying this difference has remained unresolved. Here, we applied custom-developed biophysical and proteomic assays to lamin-deficient cell lines engineered to express specific full-length lamin proteins, lamin truncations, or chimeras combining domains from A- and B-type lamins, to systematically determine their contributions to nuclear mechanics. We found that although all expressed lamins contribute to the biophysical properties of the nuclear interior and confer some mechanical stability to the nuclear envelope, which is sufficient to protect the nuclear envelope from small cell-intrinsic forces and ensure proper positioning of nuclear pores, A-type lamins endow cells with a unique ability to resist large forces on the nucleus. Surprisingly, this effect was conferred through the A-type lamin rod domain, rather than the head or tail domains, which diverge more substantially between A- and B-type lamins and play important roles in lamin network formation. Collectively, our work provides an improved understanding of the distinct functions of different lamins in mammalian cells and may also explain why mutations in the A-type lamin rod domain cause more severe muscle defects in mouse models than other mutations.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Various parameters, such as eye size, pigmentation loss, formation of necrotic patches, and disorientation, fusion or disruption of ommatidial arrays are commonly assessed to evaluate eye development and degeneration. In this study, we developed an improved optical alignment imaging technique named \"Low Angle Ring Illumination Stereomicroscopy\" (LARIS), which provides high-contrast images of the Drosophila compound eye. By capturing images of the same eye using different optical alignments of the stereomicroscope, we achieved the highest resolution with minimal reflection through the LARIS method. The images captured using LARIS clearly show ommatidial fusion, disorientation, and pigmentation loss in the Drosophila eye compared to those obtained with the conventional imaging method. We believe that LARIS will open new avenues for high-resolution imaging of the compound eyes of Drosophila and other insects.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Stress-induced cleavage of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) generates tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), whose role in this context is not fully understood. We identify elevated levels of 5'tRFGlu(CTC) and 5'tRFGly(GCC) in {beta}-cells and iMACs from db/db mice and in islets from type 2 diabetic patients. Notably, 5'tRFGlu(CTC) is also induced under prediabetic conditions and inversely correlates with insulin secretion. Lipotoxic stress triggers their production via Angiogenin-mediated cleavage. Blocking 5'tRFGlu(CTC) in islets protects against {beta}-cell apoptosis and restores insulin secretion under palmitate stress. Using a {beta}-cell/macrophage co-culture system, we show that {beta}-cell contact shapes a unique macrophage phenotype (iMAC-like) that shifts upon palmitate exposure - recapitulating in vivo observations. Inhibiting 5'tRFGlu(CTC) in iMAC-like cells prevents this activation switch, reduces {beta}-cell stress, and improves insulin secretion. Mechanistically, 5'tRFGlu(CTC) interacts with RNA-binding proteins to regulate transcriptional and post-transcriptional pathways linked to immune activation, extracellular matrex remodeling, neurogenesis, and oxidative stress. Our study identifies 5'tRFs as key mediators of islet microenvironment remodeling in diabetes, offering new insights into intercellular stress signaling in metabolic disease.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

N.; Sun, D.; Lim, K.; Edgar, J. R.; Matesic, L. E.; Marciniak, S. J.; Rawlins, E. L.; Dickens, J. A.", "abstract": "Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a fatal lung disease of progressive lung parenchymal scarring caused by the aberrant response of an alveolar epithelium repeatedly exposed to injury. Understanding epithelial dysfunction has been hampered by the lack of physiological alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell models and defined disease triggers. Monogenic forms of familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) caused by toxic gain-of-function variants provide an opportunity to investigate early pathogenic events. One such variant, surfactant protein C (SFTPC)-I73T, abnormally localises within AT2 cells and causes their dysfunction. Methods: We used base editing of fetal lung-derived AT2 (fdAT2) organoids to create a heterozygous disease model of endogenous SFTPC-I73T expression. We also created an inducible overexpression system to interrogate temporal changes associated with SFTPC-I73T expression. We cultured fdAT2 both in 3D culture and at air-liquid interface to understand the importance of polarity cues and air exposure on disease phenotypes. Results: In our heterozygous endogenous expression system, we found that fdAT2 expressing SFTPC-I73T grew without a lumen and were unable to correctly polarise. SFTPC-I73T accumulated with time and caused gross enlargement of early endosomes, preventing correct apico-basal trafficking of multiple endosomally trafficked cargoes including polarity markers and cell adhesion proteins. This phenotype was exacerbated by air exposure and led to loss of epithelial monolayer integrity and abnormal wound healing after injury. Conclusion: Using endogenous gene editing for the first time in differentiated alveolar organoids, we have demonstrated that the pathogenic effects of SFTPC-I73T are mediated through endosomal dysfunction and abnormal epithelial organisation. This has important implications for AT2 function in vivo.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Neural stem cells (NSCs) or neuroblasts in Drosophila require the regulation of mitochondrial fusion, along with the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC), to meet the metabolic demands of differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which mitochondrial fusion and activity together regulate NSC differentiation are not well understood. We investigated the relationship between mitochondrial fusion, and ETC complex I activity during Drosophila neuroblast differentiation. We found that depletion of complex I subunits did not affect the number of type II neuroblasts but reduced their proliferation, thereby decreasing the numbers of mature intermediate precursor cells (mINPs), ganglion mother cells (GMCs), and neurons in each lineage. Complex I depletion decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and cristae numbers, and increased mitochondrial fragmentation and ROS. Increased ROS resulting from the depletion of antioxidant enzymes also led to a decrease in mINPs, GMCs, and neurons in each type II neuroblast lineage. Both complex I and antioxidant protein depletion led to delayed G1/S transition and decreased nuclear cyclin E levels. Interestingly, the defects in proliferation, differentiation, and ROS in complex I and anti-oxidant protein depleted neuroblasts could be restored by fused mitochondrial morphology obtained through additional depletion of the fission protein Drp1. Further, overexpression of anti-oxidant proteins could alleviate the ROS and rescue the differentiation defect in complex I depleted type II neuroblasts. Together, this study reveals a role for complex I and mitochondrial fusion in restricting ROS for differentiation in Drosophila neuroblasts.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Conventional straight-line displacement (SLD) methods return severely and differentially biased estimates with no ability to evaluate the accuracy of the estimate. Recent methodological advances have improved our ability to estimate these parameters using continuous-time speed and distance (CTSD) estimation. However, even with CTSD estimation, many datasets are too coarse, or the location error is too great to reliably measure speed or distance traveled. To address these limitations, we investigated the relationship between CTSD-estimated mean speed and diffusion rate, where diffusion rate is defined as the variance in displacements per time interval. We calculated CTSD mean speed and diffusion rate estimates using telemetry data (i.e., trajectory data) from over 100 white-tailed deer and simulated telemetry data generated from a known movement model. We examined the relationship between the two measures in both datasets and the effect of sampling frequency on the effective sample size and the estimation of the two parameters. We found that mean speed and diffusion rate were strongly and nonlinearly correlated, with a 1% increase in diffusion rate predicting a 0.40% increase in mean speed (99% CI: 0.38-0.42%) for our focal species. Diffusion rate estimates remained substantially more accurate and precise than speed across sampling interval regimes, even when speed estimation was not possible. Our findings demonstrate that diffusion rate outperforms mean speed as a measure of movement activity under marginal data conditions. Diffusion rate is a reliable measure of movement activity and can link behavior to energetics across a wider range of datasets while maintaining accuracy even when data quality is low. By using speed and diffusion together, researchers can rely on more robust insights into space use across a range of ecological contexts.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Treatment with SRT leads to lysosomal cholesterol accumulation thereby activating the cholesterol-sensing transcription factor SREBP2 and increasing biosynthetic cholesterol flux in macrophages. In addition, this buildup of cholesterol induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), mitochondrial ROS production, and downstream NLRP3 inflammasome activation, contributing to enhanced macrophage-mediated bacterial killing.

Here, we characterized the inflammation-induced emergence of IMEC and their crosstalk with T cells. Methods and Results: An in vitro model to study IMEC was established and characterized using flow cytometry and proteomics. Single-cell transcriptome data from human atherosclerotic arteries as well as single cell transcriptome and endothelial cell-specific translatome data from a murine atherogenesis model were used to determine pathophysiological relevance. Immunopeptidomics was performed to detect antigen presentation. T cell chemotaxis, adhesion and activation were assessed through flow cytometry and microscopy. IMEC were induced by treating human endothelial cells with interleukin-1{beta}, interferon-{gamma}, and transforming growth factor-{beta}2. These cells expressed lower levels of classical endothelial cell markers but expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation (CD83, CD80 and CD86) and pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines, including CXCL9. An endothelial cell subpopulation with similar immunomodulatory features was identified in a mouse model of accelerated atherogenesis as well as in human atheromas. Conditioned medium from IMEC enhanced the migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and induced T cell chemotaxis, the latter being partially inhibited by antagonizing CXCL9. Proteins related to glycosaminoglycan degradation were significantly downregulated in IMEC which was relevant inasmuch as the glycocalyx plays a key role in the establishment of chemokine gradients. Indeed, the accumulation of heparan sulfates in IMEC contributed to the adhesion of T cells. Notably, IMEC that had been exposed to monocyte lysates presented 627 peptide antigens on MHC class II and induced T cell activation.

As a result, it remains unclear whether tumour-cell-intrinsic states exist, and whether these represent stable disease subtypes or are dynamically remodelled during disease progression and treatment. Here, we address this question using a living biobank of patient-derived ovarian cancer models (OCMs) cultured as purified tumour-cell populations under uniform conditions. RNA sequencing followed by unsupervised non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) revealed a robust, hierarchical architecture comprising three core tumour-cell-intrinsic subtypes: the Alpha cluster, marked by cell-cycle deregulation and E2F-driven replication stress; the Beta cluster, defined by tumour-cell-intrinsic immune mimicry and inflammatory signalling; and the Gamma cluster, characterised by epithelial identity, extracellular matrix engagement, and metabolic adaptation. At higher clustering resolution, a fourth cluster, Delta, emerged as a Gamma sub-lineage distinguished by a vesicle-oriented, neuronal-like secretory programme. By projecting cluster labels onto a subset of matched longitudinal OCMs using non-negative least squares, we show that while some tumours retain stable subtype identities, others display transcriptional plasticity, including transitions from epithelial-like Gamma states to more proliferative or secretory phenotypes. Together, these findings define the core architecture and dynamic potential of tumour-cell-intrinsic transcriptional states within HGSOC, thereby bridging legacy bulk classifications with emerging single-cell insights, establishing a framework for more precise patient stratification.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Using a clinically relevant mouse model that mimics spontaneous OC relapse following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, we showed that m214-sEVs were internalized by OC cells and the OC niche fibroblasts via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, resulting in the elevation of miR-214-3p/miR-199a-5p and the downregulation of chemoresistance-associated genes, including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), {beta}-catenin, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein YKT6.

Although RMM studies may be informative, they are also animal-, labor-, and time-intensive to complete and represent significant investment in time and resources during non-clinical development. Given the strong pipeline of regimens in development, identification of \"leaner\" RMM studies may have a significant impact on resource utilization, and hence we compared alternative study designs with the goal of identifying study attributes that can be modified to improve resource use, particularly animal use.

Our intention was to create a resource for the field on how Cryptococcus neoformans strain influences analysis of organ-specific immune responses in an intravenous mouse model of cryptococcal meningitis, focusing on impact of the fungal strain while keeping mouse genetic background (C57BL/6J) and infection route constant. We quantified myeloid and lymphoid cell recruitment and fungal-specific CD4 T-cell activation, correlating these results with fungal burdens in mice infected with the commonly used reference strain H99 or with two recently isolated clinical strains that were the same molecular type (VNI) or an unrelated type (VNB). We also analysed how dose used in murine infection models affected brain immune responses during C. neoformans infection. Our work reveals intriguing patterns of organ-specific immunity that are dependent on C. neoformans strain but not always explained by virulence potential, raising important questions for the field regarding the impact of C. neoformans strain on cellular immune responses in experimental animal models.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

GATA2 is a normally hematopoietic transcription factor which in the bone marrow helps maintain the proliferative, non-differentiated phenotype of hematopoietic progenitors. Unexpectedly, GATA2 is upregulated in macrophages within atherosclerotic plaque, where it plays an unknown role in disease progression. Although GATA2 can be expressed from two promoters, we determined that the atherogenic stimuli oxidized low-density lipoprotein and TNF induce GATA2 expression via the internal (IG) GATA2 promoter, with GATA2 transcription initiated by the transcription factors NF-{kappa}B, STAT1, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. GATA2 had a divergent effect on promoter activity, with GATA2 upregulating genes associated with stem cell maintenance, proliferation, reactive oxygen species production, and migration, while downregulating genes central to macrophage function including those for cholesterol efflux, pathogen phagocytosis, and for the efferocytosis of apoptotic cells. Consequentially, GATA2-expressing macrophages had a pro-atherogenic phenotype typified by an invasive phenotype, poor cholesterol efflux, and impaired phagocytosis and efferocytosis. These results indicate that GATA2 upregulation induces an immature, stem cell-like phenotype in atheroma macrophages, thereby promoting plaque cellularity while compromising atheroprotective mechanisms such as cholesterol clearance and apoptotic cell removal.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrate long-read genome assemblies, optical mapping, and k-mer based copy number analysis across eight genetically diverse inbred mouse strains to identify and characterize SD-mediated rearrangements. We identify 223 rearrangements affecting over 14 Mb of sequence and reveal substantial variation in gene content. These rearrangements affect loci involved in immunity, sensory perception, and gene regulation, including variation in the amylase gene cluster (Amy2a) and KRAB-zinc finger genes. We observed that SD flanks in mouse genomes are significantly enriched for young LINE-1 transposable elements, suggesting a potential role for transposons in promoting recombination and generating SDs within mice. Our findings highlight the contribution of SDs to genome structure and intra-species variation, and provide a resource for identifying regions prone to rearrangement in a critical model organism for biomedical research.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Three major sites of the initial dysfunction are the sensory hair cells, their innervation, and the stria vascularis which generates the high potassium endolymph maintained at a high endocochlear potential bathing the apical surface of hair cells. Treatments aimed at the initial site-of-lesion may be useful, and diagnostic tools to distinguish the primary site would help stratify clinical trials and facilitate selection of the most suitable treatment for each person. Here we report a new non-invasive test that distinguishes mutant mice with known stria vascularis dysfunction and reduced endocochlear potential from mice with sensory hair cell or neural defects but with normal endocochlear potential. It is based on measuring inter-trial coherence in auditory brainstem responses to individual stimuli. Mice with reduced strial function show good inter-trial coherence compared with the amplitude of the averaged response, while mice with sensory or neural deficits show poor coherence. This method might be useful in humans to predict whether they have reduced strial function, which cannot be measured directly, and identify who would benefit from treatments aimed at boosting strial function.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Human norovirus (HNoV) is a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, for which no antiviral therapies exist to date. Previously, our lab has demonstrated that both HNoV and murine norovirus (MNV1) are highly dependant on the expression of the Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), a cellular protein mostly involved in the assembly of stress granules. We therefore hypothesize that targeting G3BP1 could be a promising antiviral strategy against noroviruses. Here, we designed a proof-of concept study to test targeted protein degradation as a mechanism to induce the specific proteolysis of G3BP1 via the proteasome. To do so, we generated a cellular platform for the over-expression of G3BP1 fused to the bacterial protein Halotag (HaloG3BP1). First, we showed that MNV1 replication is restored in G3BP1-knockout (?G3BP1) cells complemented with HaloG3BP1. We then used a proteolysis-targeting-chimera directed towards the Halotag (HaloPROTAC), to induce the specific degradation of HaloG3BP1. We further demonstrate that proteolysis of G3BP1 reduces MNV1 replication, leading to a lower infectious virus yield and preventing virus-induced cell death. We also confirmed that the mechanism of HaloPROTAC3 is mediated via the recruitment of Cullin2-VHL E3-ubiquitin ligase. Our findings add to the body of evidence supporting that targeting of the cellular protein G3BP1 can be used as an antiviral approach, and validates the use of PROTACs for the efficient and specific degradation of cellular factors as a feasible methodology to combat viral diseases.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Its remarkable acid tolerance enables survival and proliferation in the low-pH biofilm microenvironment, establishing S. mutans as the dominant species in dental plaque and a key contributor to cariogenesis. While numerous studies have identified genes associated with acid tolerance mechanisms, the full genomic complement of essential acid tolerance genes remains poorly characterized due to the absence of genome-scale investigative approaches. To address this knowledge gap, we constructed a genome-wide pooled CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library targeting 95% of predicted S. mutans genes and employed next-generation sequencing to systematically identify acid tolerance determinants. Our screen revealed 95 acid tolerance-associated genes, a subset of which were functionally validated through gene knockout studies. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated significant associations with metabolic pathways (including cofactor biosynthesis and amino/nucleotide sugar metabolism), tRNA modification, and transcriptional regulation. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified critical interactors (comYC, SMU_1979c, deoC, acpP, nadD, and SMU_1988c) and two functionally cohesive modules.

While APOBEC3-induced mutagenesis is well documented at the DNA level, its potential impact on MPXV RNA transcripts remains unclear. To assess whether APOBEC3 enzymes act on MPXV RNA, we analyzed RNA-seq data from infected samples. The enrichment of APOBEC-signature substitutions among high-frequency mismatched positions led us to consider two possibilities: RNA editing at hotspots or fixed DNA mutations. Multiple lines of evidence support the conclusion that these substitutions arise from DNA-level mutagenesis rather than RNA editing. These include a substantial number of G[-&gt;]A substitutions remaining after normalization by gene strand direction, a largely neutral impact of substitutions on protein-coding sequences, the lack of positional correlation with transcriptional features or RNA secondary structure typically associated with APOBEC action hotspots, and an overlap with known genomic mutations in MPXV strains.

Using translation-inhibiting antibiotics and resistance proteins, we show that the temporal mismatch between environmental perturbations (seconds) and protein synthesis responses (hours) creates a growth advantage for anticipatory strategies where cells pre-synthesize resistance proteins before antibiotic exposure. Further, we find that the largest benefits of anticipation and the largest protein fractions reserved for anticipation are realized in environments with multiple antibiotics, suggesting that anticipation is most important in complex environments.

We recently discovered a family of phage-encoded, RNA-guided transcription factors known as TldR that regulate flagellin expression. However, the biological significance for this regulation, particularly in the context of host fitness, remained unknown. By focusing on a human clinical Enterobacter isolate that encodes a Flagellin Remodeling prophage (FR{varphi}), here we show that FR{varphi} exploits the combined action of TldR and its flagellin isoform to dramatically alter the flagellar composition and phenotypic properties of its host. This transformation has striking biological consequences, enhancing bacterial motility and mammalian immune evasion, and structural studies by cryo-EM of host- and prophage-encoded filaments reveal distinct architectures underlying these physiological changes. Moreover, we find that FR{varphi} improves colonization in the murine gut, illustrating the beneficial effect of prophage-mediated flagellar remodeling in a host-associated environment. Remarkably, flagellin-regulating TldR homologs emerged multiple times independently, further highlighting the strong selective pressures that drove evolution of RNA-guided flagellin control.

Herein, we performed computational analyses across 63 trypanosomatid species uncovering high degree of variability in G4-prevalence and species-specific patterns. We generated the first genome-wide map of G4s in T. brucei using G4 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (G4 ChIP-Seq), which revealed a striking enrichment of G4s within coding DNA sequences (CDSs). This pattern diverges markedly from in silico predictions and previous genome-wide G4 mapping studies in humans, suggesting that G4s may play unique roles exclusive to trypanosome biology. To investigate their functional relevance, we profiled the transcriptome of T. brucei upon treatment with the G4-stabilising ligand PhenDC3. We observed that PhenDC3 exerts targeted gene expression perturbation of genes bearing G4s, particularly those located within coding CDSs, where G4s are mostly enriched.

One of the major bacterial genera inhabiting the rhizosphere is Pseudomonas, of which most species are known to produce phenazines, which carry antibiotic properties. Pseudomonas chlororaphis, a common rhizosphere dwelling species with plant growth-promoting traits, produces phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN). This study examines how the production of PCN by Pseudomonas affects another common species in soil that it often encounters, namely Bacillus subtilis. When both species were cultured at close distance, distinct and visible changes in colony morphologies were observed without changes in growth rates. Interestingly, a clear transformation occurred in the morphology of B. subtilis colonies in the presence of supplemented PCN, indicating the role of phenazines in affecting colony morphology. In addition, untargeted metabolomics analyses showed a decrease in the production of plipastatin and surfactin by B. subtilis in the presence of P. chlororaphis. Our results indicate that PCN induces changes in morphology and signaling of B. subtilis without significantly affecting its growth. We hypothesize that P. chlororaphis and B. subtilis sense one another and act to conserve energy while avoiding competition.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

D.; Borrell, V.; Toro, R.", "abstract": "The development and evolution of neocortical organisation is typically explained by the interaction of two fundamental factors: genetics and experience-dependent processes. Morphogens and signalling molecules would orchestrate the formation of neocortical areas and connection networks, which are later refined through exposure to environmental stimuli. Evolutionary changes to these genetic programs are thought to account for the diversity of brains and behaviours observed in extant species. However, our phylogenetic comparative study of primate neuroanatomy and behaviour shows this view is incomplete. Using brain MRI from 70 primate species we observed that not only the degree of folding but also the folding pattern changes continuously with brain volume, independently of phylogenetic position. To better understand the consequences of this continuity we focused on New and Old World monkeys which diverged approximately 47 million years ago. Large New World monkeys, such as capuchins, have a significantly larger and more folded neocortex than many of their close phylogenetic relatives, whose brains are barely folded. Notably, in addition to folding, their thickness and connectivity patterns were almost identical to those of phylogenetically distant Old World monkeys. Combined analyses of MRI and endocasts from 105 primate species indicated that the highly folded neocortex of large New World monkeys evolved independently from a common ancestor with a small, unfolded brain. Remarkably, across all 70 species, behavioural similarity correlated substantially more with neuroanatomical similarity than with phylogenetic similarity. Our results challenge the prevailing explanation of the development and evolution of neocortical organisation. We propose that the \"capuchin anomaly\" can be resolved by incorporating mechanical morphogenesis, alongside genetics and experience, as a third fundamental factor. Growth-driven mechanical instabilities would produce similar neuroanatomical organisation patterns and behaviours, emerging independently of the specific genetic determinants of that growth.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

However, experimental characterization of the transcriptomic response to interferon (IFN) stimulation and/or influenza virus infection has been limited, particularly in defining the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), with most being computationally predicted. In this study, we present a comprehensive transcriptome-wide assessment of the ferret transcriptome following IFN- treatment of a ferret lung (FRL) cell line, as well as in nasal turbinates from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected ferrets using long-read RNA sequencing. We have identified a panel of ferret genes orthologous to human ISGs that are upregulated both in response to IFN- stimulation in vitro and IAV infection in vivo. We have also identified novel interferon stimulated genes and transcripts. Furthermore, we observed elongation of the poly(A) tails of genes in the ribosome and Coronavirus Disease-19 pathways in response to IFN- treatment in vitro, suggesting a relationship between poly(A) elongation and the antiviral responses of the host. These results illuminate the dynamics of the transcriptional innate immune response of the domestic ferret and provide an important resource for better utilizing ferrets as a small animal model to study influenza virus infections.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used a genetic approach in Drosophila to determine how sleep interacts with sex to influence the outcomes of infection with Metarhizium anisopliae strain Ma549. We found that as in mammals, Drosophila slept more after infection. The sleep-deprived Drosophila Shaker mutant with intact circadian rhythms failed to show this increased sleep response (sickness sleep) and succumbed quickly to infection. Mutants with disrupted PERIOD (PER) or CLOCK (CLK) affect circadian rhythms. The per01 mutant shifted day/night cycles but not total sleep amounts, whereas the ClkJrk mutant reduced sleep duration. Although mutations in per or Clk both impair sickness sleep, only per protects against disease, whereas active Clk reduces survival in infected Drosophila, which we attribute to it being pleiotropic. Independent of mutant status, males slept more than females, and virgins slept more than mated flies and survived infection longer, indicating that sex and mating status influence sleep and disease resistance irrespective of circadian rhythms.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Environmental ARG surveillance is an early-warning approach that can better inform antibiotic usage. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is widely used for ARG surveillance because qPCR is easy, fast, and highly sensitive. However, it can only identify DNA targeted by pre-selected primers. In contrast, metagenomic sequencing can identify ARGs agnostically. However, sequencing is more expensive, less sensitive, and requires lengthy analysis of complex data sets. Target-enrichment metagenomic sequencing (TEMS), a method we developed previously, can mitigate the disadvantage of low sensitivity of traditional metagenomic sequencing. In this study, we propose a hybrid ARG surveillance pipeline for wastewater that capitalizes on both TEMS and qPCR. It uses a large-scale target determination of ARGs by using TEMS, followed by fine-scale routine surveillance of ARGs using qPCR. To connect the two steps, we developed a primer design tool, MSEDAP, which automatically analyzes metagenomic sequencing data and designs qPCR primers for ARG surveillance. This new workflow was ground-truthed using wastewater samples.

Increases in soil salinity may affect organisms widely and particularly impact soil foodwebs. As parasites, entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) occupy crucial links in soil foodwebs and are important for agriculture as biological control agents of insect pests. Previous research found that the EPN Steinernema carpocapsae may exhibit higher salt tolerance than several of its congeners. We recently identified that S. carpocapsae uniquely evolved two amino acid substitutions in the first extracellular loop of the sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase). Here, we tested if these substitutions explain the reported lower sensitivity of S. carpocapsae to salt. Our results confirm that S. carpocapsae exhibits higher salt tolerance and show it can more effectively locate and infect insect hosts than its congeners S. feltiae and S. hermaphroditum in highly saline environments. We then retraced the evolution of the two amino acid substitutions in S. carpocapsae by introducing them alone and in combination in Caenorhabditis elegans using CRISPR genome engineering. We found that C. elegans mutants with single substitutions showed improved salt tolerance. However, this improvement disappeared in the double mutant, whose sodium pump mimicked that of S. carpocapsae. This pattern of negative epistasis between the amino acid substitutions suggests they are not responsible for variation in salt tolerance between Steinernema species. Sodium pump evolution in S. carpocapsae might instead be driven by encounters with cardiac glycosides, which are released into soil by several clades of plants including milkweeds, sequestered by some of this EPNs herbivorous insect hosts, and known to target the first extracellular loop of the sodium pump. Our findings provide valuable insights into EPN adaptation to changes in environmental sodium levels and may have implications for their use in biological control.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Several geminate species pairs of both vertebrates and invertebrates formed following the uplift of the CAI, including damselfishes of the Pomacentridae family.

In this study we present genome assemblies for the transisthmian species pair consisting of the Sergeant Major Abudefduf saxatilis (Tropical Atlantic) and the Panamic Sergeant Major Abudefduf troschelii (Tropical Eastern Pacific) derived from PacBio long-read sequencing. The new genomes are near-chromosome level, and among the highest-quality genomes currently available for coral reef fishes. We show that large structural variants distinguish the two species, including a 9 megabase inversion in linkage group (putative chromosome) 6. Additionally, we show through an analysis of demographic history that alleles within the two genomes have different coalescence time distributions, which may be due to different effective population sizes, population structures, and/or selection regimes in the two oceans. Finally, we highlight gene families that were significantly expanded or contracted between A. troschelii and A. saxatilis. Some of these are related to the environmental conditions that differ between the two oceans, such as gamma crystallin M (crygm), which is linked to vision, and vitellogenin (vtg), which is associated with egg provisioning.

However, many existing PPI networks contain systematic errors that limit prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning approach, ProtLoc-GRPO, to enhance subcellular localization prediction by optimizing the structure of the underlying PPI network. ProtLoc-GRPO learns to rank and retain the most informative PPI edges to maximize the macro-F1 score for cell line-specific subcellular localization.

Traditional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods, although efficient, are sensitive to outliers, particularly when datasets contain observations below the limit of quantification (BLQ). As clinical datasets become increasingly complex, more robust modeling approaches are needed. In this study, a simulation-based evaluation was conducted to compare four modeling strategies combining different residual error structures (normal vs. Students t) and censoring methods (M1 vs. M3). Two-compartment pharmacokinetic profiles were simulated for fifty subjects, incorporating varying degrees of outlier contamination and BLQ data. Full Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods was employed to estimate posterior distributions of PK parameters at both the population and individual levels. Notably, the combination of Students t-distributed residuals with M3 censoring (Students t_M3) consistently produced the most accurate and precise parameter estimates across all simulation scenarios, even under extreme outlier contamination and substantial BLQ presence. The combination of Students t-distributed residuals with M3 censoring within a Bayesian framework offers a robust and resilient strategy for PopPK modeling, effectively addressing both outlier contamination and data censoring challenges.

Methods Male Wistar rats were fed for 10 weeks with either a commercial grain-based diet (C/GB), a balanced semi-purified diet (B/SP), or a high-fat/high-sugar semi-purified diet (HFS/SP). Murinometric, metabolic, histological, and oxidative parameters were assessed. Multivariate clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to identify metabolic phenotypes. Results Despite similar caloric intake, B/SP-fed rats developed increased adiposity and body weight without metabolic disturbances. In contrast, HFS/SP-fed animals exhibited hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and marked systemic oxidative stress despite no excess weight gain. Clustering analysis identified three partially overlapping phenotypes: a metabolically healthy profile (C/GB), an intermediate profile resembling metabolically healthy obesity (B/SP), and a distinct metabolically unhealthy non-obese group (HFS/SP). The overlap between B/SP and C/GB groups suggests a transitional zone rather than sharply defined states. Oxidative stress markers and hepatic steatosis were strongly associated with metabolic impairments, especially in the HFS/SP group. Conclusion Diet composition and processing play a decisive role in shaping metabolic and redox phenotypes, independent of caloric intake or body mass. These findings support the fuel partitioning hypothesis and expand the translational relevance of Wistar rats by demonstrating intermediate and overlapping metabolic states resembling human obesity subtypes not previously documented, highlighting the potential of male Wistar rats as a versatile model to study diverse obesity-related metabolic phenotypes relevant to human conditions.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

While conventional models describe fruit development based on growth parameters for the whole fruit, it remains unclear how tissue growth at different fruit portions is coordinated to promote overall fruit development. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the relationship between differences in developmental rates among fruit portions and fruit morphology in persimmon (Diospyros kaki), a species known for its high morphological diversity. Starting two weeks after blooming (WAB), surface landmarks were routinely drawn along the calyx-apex line on fruits of four persimmon cultivars with diverse shapes, and the landmark displacement was quantified every two weeks using 3D phenotyping. Consistent with previous studies, all cultivars exhibited active development in the regions near the calyx, with the greatest difference in growth rates between the calyx and apex occurring at 6-8 WAB. However, the extent of these spatial differences varied among cultivars. In elongated fruits, a gradual growth gradient was observed from the calyx toward the apex, with relatively high growth rates even near the apex. In contrast, in flattened fruits, growth was highly concentrated near the calyx, while development in other regions remained minimal. The findings of this study provide a foundation for future research on fruit shape regulation and the elucidation of physiological disorders in persimmon.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

One of the most effective methods for controlling blackleg is through the cultivation of resistant varieties. Consequently, scoring blackleg disease severity of infected plants is a key metric for identifying and selecting resistant varieties. Traditionally, blackleg severity is scored by expert raters who evaluate disease in stem cross sections using established rating scales and reference images; however, human raters are expensive and inconsistent in their scoring. Here, we introduce a machine learning algorithm based on deep learning models that can score blackleg severity from cross-section images of infected plants. We find that expert ratings are largely inconsistent across raters and across years for the same rater, creating substantial noise in susceptibility ratings. Meanwhile, our trained machine learning model performs more consistently than the median rater while maintaining a similar heritability as expert raters for the blackleg susceptibility trait. This model can be used to standardize blackleg susceptibility scoring across locations and years to improve canola breeding outcomes across affected regions.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 49 patients in the Responsive group, 33 patients in the Resistant group, and 50 healthy controls (HCs). Using resting-state fMRI, we derived LN dynamic integration coefficients and used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify coactivation patterns. Depressive symptoms (Self-Rating Depression Scale, SDS), LN integration, and NMF pattern expression were compared across groups (ANOVA) and correlated. Mediation analysis tested if LN integration mediated the relationship between drug resistance status and SDS scores. LN integration differences were spatially correlated with neurotransmitter receptor density and Allen Human Brain Atlas transcriptomic data. Results: Patients in the Resistant group reported significantly higher SDS scores than patients in the Responsive group (p = 0.008). LN integration with the dorsal attention network (DAN) and fronto-parietal network (FPN) was significantly lower in the Resistant group compared to the Responsive group (p = 0.001; p < 0.001). NMF analysis identified key LN-DAN (p = 0.013) and LN-FPN (p < 0.001) coactivation patterns. In TLE patients, DAN-LN integration was negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r = -0.28, p = 0.01), and lower integration levels significantly mediated the relationship between group status (Resistant vs. Responsive) and increased symptom severity (p < 0.001).

Thirty-three healthy seniors (aged 64-85) underwent two session concurrent MR-PET imaging with [18F]fallypride involving scene categorisation task with high- and low-motivational contexts. We quantified BPND0 across nine dopaminergic regions of interest and examined their relationships with recognition memory performance at short (~15m) and long (~24h) delays. Baseline D2/D3 receptor availability showed high test-retest reliability and regionally distinct profiles, suggesting it reflects a stable neurochemical characteristic in healthy ageing, and principal axis factor analysis revealed two partially independent dopaminergic subsystems (dorsal striatal vs mesolimbic) based on interindividual patterns in receptor densities. Region-specific associations further linked D2/D3 receptor availability to distinct memory outcomes. Higher caudate D2/D3 receptor availability was associated with a liberal response bias (increased hits and false alarms both), whereas higher putamen D2/D3 predicted more durable long-term memory retention. Greater thalamic D2/D3 receptor availability correlated with fewer short-term false memories, while greater D2/D3 receptor availability in the amygdala was associated with better recognition at longer delays.

In the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), neurons projecting to lateral higher visual areas are relatively evenly distributed throughout layer 2/3, whereas those projecting to medial areas are biased toward more superficial sublayers. To determine whether these projection identities are linked to neurogenic timing, we combined EdU birthdating with retrograde viral tracing. Notably, we found that V1 layer 2/3 neurons projecting to lateral higher visual areas are preferentially born at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) compared to E16.5, whereas V1 neurons projecting to medial higher visual areas show no significant birthdate bias between E15.5 and E16.5.

In measles virus (MeV), the nonstructural protein C has long been implicated in regulating RNA synthesis, yet its precise role remains unclear. Here, we show that the MeV C protein directly associates with the RdRP complex. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined atomic-resolution structures of the MeV polymerase with and without C, revealing that C binding stabilizes the accessory domains of L and locks the complex into a replication-competent elongation state. Biochemical data further show that C promotes N protein recruitment, enhancing polymerase processivity through facilitating encapsidation during replication. Additionally, we also resolved high-resolution structures of MeV and Nipah virus (NiV) polymerases bound to ERDRP-0519, an orally available morbillivirus inhibitor. Unexpectedly, the compound occupies a previously unrecognized allosteric pocket within the RdRp domain, rather than the predicted PRNTase domain, overlapping conserved resistance sites. This binding induces conformational changes in palm subdomain, blocking RNA template and nucleotide engagement, thereby halting RNA synthesis.

Composite scores confirmed suppression of biogenesis (p = 0.029) and a trend toward reduced mitophagy (p = 0.057). Transcripts encoding oxidative phosphorylation subunits and fusion and fission factors remained unchanged, suggesting preserved mitochondrial content and network homeostasis at day 21. These findings indicate that a single space relevant heavy ion exposure selectively disrupts early transcriptional steps of mitochondrial turnover without immediately altering organelle abundance of transcripts for electron transport chain or dynamics; in contrast simulated lunar gravity alone did not elicit changes in these pathways.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Animals use diverse behavioural and physiological adjustments to avoid dehydration. However, the physiological and fitness costs of these mechanisms are often overlooked, despite their potential to shift nutrient acquisition and allocation. We hypothesized that maintaining water balance, through increased water intake and/or decreased water loss, leads to nutrient shifts and trade-offs in Pieris rapae butterflies. In this species, females receive a protein- and water-rich nuptial gift (NG), known to enhance fecundity and possibly mitigate dehydration. We quantified the impact of dry conditions on female hydration and fitness, using stable isotopes to trace nutrient allocation to storage, fecundity, and catabolism. We found that the NG, combined with reduced respiratory water loss, contributed to maintaining female water balance in dry conditions. Importantly, while dry environments did not impact potential fecundity, nutritional shifts and trade-offs that could affect long-term fitness were evident: females allocated more lipids to eggs at the expense of long-term storage, while reducing catabolism of NG-derived leucine. This interplay among water balance, nutrient allocation, and fitness emphasizes the importance of linking water balance mechanisms with broader nutrient-use strategies under environmental stress.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

The speed and extent of its spread depend on contact patterns and the virus's intrinsic characteristics. To estimate propagation speed and the role of inter-individual patterns, we analyzed the results of a series of 12 experimental infections conducted in five different sessions, involving six or seven goats in a secured stable. In each experiment, one animal was inoculated with the PPR strain and placed in contact with the other naive animals. All the animals were equipped with Ultra-WideBand sensors to collect inter-individual distance data. The duration of this phase varied from 1 to 48 hours across the experiments. Afterwards, the animals were isolated and monitored for three to five weeks. Temperature, symptoms, nasal and ocular discharges, and blood samples were routinely collected to detect the presence of the virus. Using Bayesian statistical analysis, data on inter-individual distances, and health status were analyzed to estimate R0, the incubation period, and PPRV transmissibility. The latter was used to estimate the exposure period, i.e., the minimum amount of time for a naive animal to become infected. Of the 70 naive animals exposed to the virus, 18 were infected. R0 was estimated to be around 4.3 or 8.6, depending on the infectious period value. The incubation period was estimated to be around 16.3 days (95% CI: 12.6-23.3 days). The exposure time varies greatly depending on the density, ranging from nearly two days at low density to around four hours at high density. Large gatherings of animals, such as at livestock markets, could greatly facilitate the spread of PPRV. Furthermore, the long incubation period coupled with livestock mobility could favor the virus geographical dissemination on a large scale.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Individual speed distributions follow a two-component Rayleigh distribution, reflecting bimodal locomotion (progressions and lingering), while the ensemble- averaged distribution simplifies to a single exponential decay with a slower high-speed decay rate. This discrepancy arises from population heterogeneity in characteristic speeds. We propose a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the averaged rodent, which in some cases can be derived by averaging the individual SDE. The SDE's reveal a striking mechanistic difference in the nature of individual and averaged motion: individual rodents exhibit viscous friction (deceleration proportional to speed), whereas the ensemble behaves as if subject to dry friction (constant deceleration). We propose an algorithm of creating a \"reference\" rodent, which retains the shape of individual distributions but utilizes averaged scale parameters. It can be a useful personalized comparison tool to extract the information on the locomotor modes, e.g. in biomedical contexts.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

One such example are pH-sensitive DNA nanoswitches that can be actuated by proton-mediated Hoogsteen interactions within a DNA triplex domain. To date, studies of pH-sensitive DNA nanoswitches have largely focused on DNA machines that are freely diffusing in the solution phase. For many applications, it is advantageous to integrate these dynamic DNA machines with solid-state devices, requiring immobilization on surfaces. Here, we explore the switching of a pH-sensitive DNA triplex immobilized on a surface as a dense, 2-dimensional DNA monolayer. DNA nanoswitches were assembled onto surfaces via thiol chemistry and pH-controlled conformational switching of the constructs examined using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). These QCM-D experiments indicate that despite the high density of DNA within the monolayer (10^12 molecules/cm^2), pH-switching between open and closed states is retained following immobilization. Moreover, conformational switching of DNA constructs within the monolayer remains highly reversible and repeatable, with negligible reduction in switching efficiency observed over 20 switching cycles. DNA switching experiments were also performed in the solution phase using single-molecular Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and circular dichroism (CD) techniques to confirm their pH responsitivity. Finally, we demonstrate electrically driven, localised, and addressable switching of the DNA triplex by employing electrochemical reduction and oxidation of water at an electrode surface, further demonstrating the potential of the technology for surface-immobilized dynamic DNA machines. This study not only provides insight into the actuation of DNA machines on-surface but also supports the development of new technologies such as hybrid electronic-DNA technologies able to store and process information using both molecular and electronic inputs.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

With an increasing number of new methods to analyze the multitude of heterogeneous states captured in single particle images, a systematic approach to validation in this field is needed. With this motivation, we issued a challenge to the community to analyze two cryo-EM image particle sets of the thyroglobulin molecule with continuous conformational heterogeneity. The first dataset was a experimental, and the second was generated with a simulator, allowing control over the distribution of molecular structures in the particle images. This simulated dataset also enabled direct comparison between participants' submissions and the ground truth molecular structures and distributions. Participants were asked to submit 80 volumes representing the heterogeneous ensemble and estimate their respective populations in the image sets provided. Participation of the research community in the challenge was strong, with submissions from nearly all developers of heterogeneity methods, resulting in 41 submissions across both datasets. Submissions qualitatively exceeded expectations, with the molecular motions identified by methods resembling both each other and the ground truth motion. However, quantitatively assessing these similarities was a challenge in and of itself. In the process of assessing the submissions to this challenge, we developed several validation metrics, most of which require reference to the underlying ground truth volumes. However, we have also explored the use of metrics which do not necessarily reference ground truth. This is particularly apt for experimental datasets where ground truth is inaccessible. These approaches allowed us to assess the similarity and accuracy in volume quality, molecular motions, and conformational distribution of different submissions. These metrics and the efforts of all participants will help chart a path forward for the improvements of heterogeneity methods for cryo-EM and future challenges to validate these new methods as they continue to be developed by the community.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the maximum angle and both the stiffness. Forty-one healthy adults participated. The shear wave velocities of the triceps surae muscles and tibial nerve were measured at 5, 15, and 25 degree ankle dorsiflexion. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed using the forced entry method, specifying the shear wave velocities of the four tissues as the independent variables and the maximum angle as the dependent variable. This analysis was performed at each angle where the shear wave velocity was measured. Multiple linear regression analysis was also performed using the stepwise method, specifying the shear wave velocities of the tibial nerve at the three angles as the independent variables and the maximum angle as the dependent variable. Using the forced entry method, the shear wave velocity of the tibial nerve at each angle was significantly negatively associated with the maximum angle, whereas those of the muscles were not. Using the stepwise method, only the shear wave velocity of the tibial nerve at 25 degree was significantly negatively associated with the maximum angle. These results suggest that the tibial nerve stiffness in a greatly lengthened position determines the maximum angle of ankle dorsiflexion.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

Data collected from 521 students at private university in Vietnam were processed using EFA, CFA and SEM. The results showed that both EA and AEEL had positive effects on AT, SN and PBC (p < 0.001). Among them, AEEL had the strongest influence on SN ({beta} = 0.281) and PBC ({beta} = 0.252).

H.; Mehta, M.", "abstract": "Introduction: Psychedelics are emerging as potential treatments for neuropsychiatric conditions, with evidence suggesting a single administration can lead to enduring behavioural changes. While the underlying putative mechanism(s) remain unclear, there is evidence supporting altered learning as a key candidate. Aim: This systematic review examined studies assessing the effects of psychedelics on associative learning in both humans and animals. Methods: Electronic databases were searched up until 13/01/2025 for studies investigating any difference in learning after psychedelic administration. Results: 31 studies were included (29 in animals, 2 in humans). Classical and operant conditioning paradigms were employed, including fear extinction, conditioned avoidance, and reversal learning. Studies assessed acute and post-acute effects, however repeated dosing paradigms often obscured this distinction. There was considerable heterogeneity in study designs, paradigms, drug administration timings and doses, and behavioural effects appeared to be influenced by dose, timing, training intensity, and sex. Due to between-study heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not possible. Evidence suggests that psychedelic administration enhances associative learning in animals across paradigms, although findings were not entirely consistent. Possible mechanisms identified were increased prediction error sensitivity, serotonin receptor agonism, and structural plasticity. Learning enhancements may extend into the post-acute phase and appear to depend on active environmental engagement during this window. Conclusion: Studies suggest that psychedelics enhance associative learning in animals; however, these findings are yet to be translated into humans. Understanding whether a period of enhanced learning follows the psychedelic experience may have important implications for psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, where behavioural changes must generalise and persist beyond the drug-induced state.", "date": "2025-07-22", "journal": ""}

After adjusting psychometric endogeneity, we demonstrate the unique predictive roles of non-planning impulsivity (NPI) during late adolescence and early adulthood uniquely predicts procrastination in later adulthood in a twin cohort (N = 154). This association was further replicated in two independent cohorts (N = 327, N = 1,543). Using AE models, in conjunction of single-paper meta-analytic synthesis (N = 3,656 twin pairs), we observed significant shared genetic contributions underlying this NPI-procrastination association (rg = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.84). Beyond to the phenotypic heritability, employing a Genome-Wide-Association Study (GWAS), six NPI-procrastination overlapping SNPs are identified, functionally accounting for neural dysregulation. Thus, leveraging neurodevelopmental normative modelling (N = 37,407), online meta-analytic estimations (k = 198, loci = 5,855) and seed-based d mapping estimates (N = 893), cortical deviations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) - the brain region showing highest probabilistic overlap mapping NPI to procrastination, partly explains their shared genetic variants, but are substantially independent in genetic contribution.

Understanding the mechanisms in neurons and glia that regulate AxD is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to prevent or mitigate axon loss. Wallerian degeneration (WD) is a well-established model to study the mechanisms of nerve injury-induced AxD, glial responses, and axon-glia interactions. We recently showed that Schwann cells (SCs), the axon-associated glia of the peripheral nervous system, exert protective effects on axons through their rapid metabolic injury response [4]. Enhancing this SC response promotes axon protection during WD [4]. A prior study reported that eliminating the orphan tumor necrosis factor receptor DR6 (death receptor 6, Tnfrsf21) strongly delays AxD and alters SC injury responses during WD, suggesting a possible intersection with our findings [5]. Here, we rigorously revisit the role of DR6 in WD using two independent DR6 knockout mouse lines including the same model used in the previous study. Surprisingly, in striking contrast to the earlier report, we observed no impact of DR6 deletion on AxD kinetics or SC injury responses across a range of WD assays. Moreover, injured axons in primary neuronal cultures lacking DR6 degenerated at a similar rate as wild-type axons. We conclude that DR6 is dispensable for the regulation of AxD and glial nerve injury responses during WD.

Such vaccines require complex manufacture, deployment and intravenous administration. Here, we report an alternative strategy of chemo-attenuation of malaria parasites at the late liver stage using first-in-class antimalarials under clinical development that target the parasite aspartyl proteases plasmepsin IX and X. A single low-dose infection with virulent Plasmodium berghei sporozoites followed by drug treatment cleared infection by producing chemo-attenuated liver merozoites (CALM) that induced sterile immunity in mice for up to 21 months. Protection arose from humoral responses to circumsporozoite protein and robust CD8+ T cell responses, including liver-resident memory cells reactive to diverse antigens including SERA1 and RPL6. Drug treatment also attenuated the human pathogen P. falciparum by preventing liver merozoites from infecting human erythrocytes in humanized chimeric liver mice, confirming that the mechanism of liver-stage merozoite attenuation (ie, CALM) via inhibition of plasmepsins IX and X is conserved, likely due to conservation of binding site amino acids of both proteases across the Plasmodium genus. Therefore, plasmepsin IX/X-targeting antimalarials offer a new approach to achieving late liver stage arrest against all circulating Plasmodium species and strains. This study establishes the basis for clinical trials assessing CALM for chemoprevention and chemovaccination against diverse Plasmodium species to advance new therapeutic strategies in malaria control.
