Here, we used pupillometry in an auditory detection task, the Competitive Attention Test (CAT), previously performed in large cohort studies, to examine how task engagement (active vs. passive) and stimulus relevance (informative vs. uninformative cues) modulate arousal. Results showed that both relevant and irrelevant sounds elicited larger pupil dilation under active conditions, indicating a global arousal effect. Crucially, only relevant sounds benefited from an additional dilation when preceded by an informative cue, demonstrating a selective arousal mechanism associated to top-down attention. These findings illustrate the NEs dual role in boosting overall alertness while selectively enhancing high-priority stimuli. Beyond theoretical implications, this work highlights that the CAT captures measurable arousal components, reinforcing its utility for clinical assessments of attention-arousal clinical disruptions.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

However, ecological networks commonly possess a variety of properties, such as hierarchies or functional groups, that structure species interactions. Here, we ask how conclusions from random interaction models are altered by the presence of such community-level network structures. We consider a Lotka-Volterra model where pairwise species interactions combine structure and randomness, and study macroscopic community-level observables, abundance distributions and dynamical regimes. Randomness and structure combine in a surprisingly yet deceptively straightforward way: contributions from each component to community patterns are largely independent. Yet, their interplay has non-trivial consequences, notably out of equilibrium. We conclude that whether interaction structure matters depends on the pattern: when breaking species equivalence, static patterns of species presence and abundance predicted from random interaction models are less robust than the qualitative nature of dynamical regimes.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

In Arabidopsis, uridylation influences mRNA decay both by favoring 5 to 3 degradation and by preventing excessive deadenylation. Yet, the significance of mRNA uridylation during plant development remains largely unknown. Here, we adapted FLEP-seq2, a method based on nanopore sequencing, to generate a comprehensive inventory of mRNA uridylation events in different Arabidopsis tissues. We also evaluated the respective contribution of the two known Arabidopsis uridylyltransferases, URT1 and HESO1, in mRNA uridylation. Our transcriptome-wide analysis showed that, URT1 is the main enzyme responsible for mRNA uridylation, in all analyzed tissues, while HESO1 can marginally uridylate mRNAs. Importantly, our results revealed the singularity of mRNA uridylation pattern in seeds and the dual function of URT1-dependent uridylation in shaping the transcriptome during seed maturation. We propose that during the late stages of seed maturation, URT1-dependent uridylation facilitates the degradation of unnecessary mRNAs encoding translation-related proteins, while also promoting the accumulation of mRNAs associated with the maturation program, by hindering their deadenylation. In line with its important function in shaping the seed transcriptome, our study also identifies URT1 as a novel regulator of seed dormancy.

We present GlueMap, a computational platform for discovering and optimizing molecular glues (MGs) through integrative structural and pharmacodynamic modeling. GlueMap combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning (ML) to model targeted protein degradation (TPD) mediated by molecular glues. We validated GlueMap by applying it to two case studies: DDB1-dependent degradation of CDK12 and CRBN-dependent degradation of GSPT1. In the DDB1-CDK12 system, GlueMap revealed strong correlations between ternary-complex stability, quantified through rigorous free-energy calculations, and experimental degradation efficiency. Notable outliers underscored the importance of incorporating conformational dynamics within assembled Cullin-RING ligase complexes. Using a supervised variational autoencoder combined with attention-based regression, GlueMap achieved high predictive accuracy for degradation potency from structural features. For CRBN-GSPT1, GlueMap reproduced known ternary-complex crystal structures and identified previously unrecognized protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that may guide the design of next-generation glues. Hierarchical virtual screening of more than 12 billion compounds successfully recovered known degraders and uncovered nine new potent MGs with DC50 values below 50 nM. Across both systems, GlueMap outperformed Boltz-1 and Boltz-2, state-of-the-art structure-prediction models that failed to reproduce the CDK12-DDB1 crystal structure and captured substantially less PPI diversity. By integrating structural, thermodynamic, and ubiquitination metrics, GlueMap establishes a multi-criteria framework for rational molecular glue design. These results demonstrate that GlueMap provides both mechanistic insight and practical acceleration of molecular glue discovery and optimization across diverse therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Here we report that two atypical endo-{beta}-1,4-mannanases (MANs), which are not secreted and do not degrade glucomannan in the cell wall, play a novel role in glucomannan synthesis. Among the six MANs in Arabidopsis, AtMAN2 and AtMAN5 contain a transmembrane domain at their N-terminal region instead of a signal peptide. Subcellular localization using MAN protein fused with fluorescent protein demonstrated that AtMAN2 localizes to the endomembrane system including the Golgi apparatus in xylem and interfascicular fiber cells. We found that an Arabidopsis man2 man5 double mutant lost 65% of glucomannan in the cell walls of the inflorescence stem. Immunostaining and immunoelectron microscopic observation also revealed that the man2 man5 double mutant lost glucomannan in the cell walls to about the same extent as the csla2 csla9 double mutant, which lacks major glucomannan synthases. A gene complementation experiment showed that the catalytic activity of AtMAN2 is important for the function in synthesis of glucomannan for the cell wall. Arabidopsis possesses another atypical MAN, AtMAN6, with an HDEL retention signal at its C-terminus. However, mutation of AtMAN6 did not affect glucomannan content in the cell walls, suggesting distinct functions for these MANs. This study has identified AtMAN2 and AtMAN5 as novel factors necessary for the normal glucomannan synthesis in Arabidopsis, along with GDP-mannose generating enzymes and CslAs, and suggests that the glucomannan hydrolysis by these MANs contributes to the maintenance of glucomannan synthesis.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Machine learning models trained on brain connectivity data are increasingly used as tools for predicting behavioral phenotypes 1,2, enhancing precision medicine 3,4, and improving generalizability compared to traditional MRI studies 5. However, the high dimensionality of brain connectivity data makes model interpretation challenging 6. Prevailing practices within the field rely on sparsely selected brain connectivity features, implicitly interpreting identified feature networks as uniquely representative of a given phenotype while overlooking others. Here, we show that commonly overlooked brain connectivity features can achieve similar prediction accuracies while yielding markedly different neurobiological interpretations. Using four large-scale neuroimaging datasets spanning over 12,000 participants and 13 outcomes, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is widespread across cognitive, developmental, and psychiatric phenotypes. It extends to both functional connectivity (fMRI) and structural (DTI) connectomes and remains evident even in external validation. These findings suggest that common practices may lead to feature overinterpretation and a misrepresentation of the neurobiological bases of brain-behavior associations. Such interpretations present only the \"tip of the iceberg\" when certain disregarded features may be just as meaningful, potentially contributing to ongoing issues surrounding reproducibility within the field.

To date, the mechanisms by which cCMV infection results in symptomatic disease are incompletely understood. The placenta has been implicated as a main thoroughfare for vertical transmission, as both placental immune cells and trophoblasts can be infected by CMV. The goal of this study was to spatially investigate changes in genes and proteins from immune cells and trophoblasts during cCMV infection. Utilizing the NanoString GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, we noted that both immune cells and trophoblasts in CMV+ placentae exhibited increased expression and upregulation of immune activation receptors and pathways. Pro-apoptotic proteins were decreased in CMV+ placentae, as were transcripts associated with cell death pathways. Spatially, immune cells infiltrating into CMV+ placental villi had more CD4+ T cells expressing cell death markers than those T cells in the decidua (p = 0.002). In contrast, the decidua exhibited a CD8+ T cell abundance with far less upregulation of immune activation receptors than in the villi (p=0.03).

Combining in vitro, in vivo, and in silico models, we report that the canonical Notch signaling during SMC differentiation is largely driven by Notch2. While Notch2 and Notch3 co-regulate a large group of genes in SMCs upon Jagged1 interaction, Notch3 is a less potent inducer of Notch signaling than Notch2 and requires higher doses to potentiate a meaningful transcriptional response due to its weak interaction with RBPJ{kappa}. Consequently, Notch2 depletion abolishes Notch signaling in the SMCs of the large elastic arteries. However, high Jagged1 and Notch3 expression in smaller arteries like those in the brain can compensate for Notch2 loss. This work refines our mechanistic understanding of Notch signaling in the SMCs and offers region-specific insights into the Notch-related arterial diseases.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

In squamates, karyotypic evolution mainly involves chromosome number reduction through fusions and microchromosome to macrochromosome translocations, although fissions have also contributed to diversification in several lineages. Despite these dynamics, the evolutionary processes and underlying genetic mechanisms driving chromosomal rearrangements and associated gene losses in squamates remain poorly understood. Results In this study, we analysed chromosome/scaffold-level assemblies of 261 squamates, corroborated by short-read, long-read, and transcriptomic data. We found multiple lines of evidence for the putative loss of 53 genes in the squamate lineage. Synteny and phylogenetic analysis revealed that, among the 53 unretrieved orthologs, 14 are lost in squamates with no retained paralog, 15 show ortholog loss with retained paralogs, and 24 remain as unretrieved orthologs. Furthermore, we find that many of the genes lost from squamates are organised in syntenic clusters and are involved in essential immune functions-raising important questions about the role of paralogs in compensating for the function of lost genes, strengthening the \"less is more\" hypothesis in the squamate lineage. Conclusions Together, our comparative genomic analyses highlight that the loss of crucial genes in squamate lineages has occurred primarily through inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements, including segmental deletions.

Our system integrates a lightweight Raspberry Pi 5, an infrared touchscreen, a webcam, and an automated food dispenser with a facial recognition model capable of detecting and identifying individuals in real time. This pipeline allows individualized cognitive tests--validated in laboratory touchscreen paradigms--to be presented dynamically as monkeys approach or leave the testing station. During pilot deployment with two habituated groups in the Taboga Forest Reserve, Costa Rica, multiple individuals voluntarily engaged with the apparatus. Several rapidly formed and retained associations between touching the screen and receiving rewards, demonstrating both feasibility and strong motivation to participate. The system simultaneously generated a video database for training the next iteration of our facial recognition model, enabling expansion to individual-level testing. By automating identity recognition, stimulus assignment, and reward control, CapuchinAI overcomes limitations of traditional field experiments, including monopolization by dominant individuals and restricted sample sizes. This approach offers a scalable framework to investigate interindividual and longitudinal variation in cognition directly in wild settings, bridging laboratory and field methodologies. Beyond capuchins, the apparatus is adaptable to other primates and species, providing a powerful new tool to advance comparative cognition, ecological psychology, and evolutionary anthropology.\n\nResearch HighlightsO_LIWe present CapuchinAI, a field-ready touchscreen testing station that uses real-time facial recognition to study cognition in wild capuchin monkeys\nC_LIO_LIWe developed a YOLOv7-based facial recognition model (Multiple Capuchins v1.0) that identifies individual capuchins with >97% precision and recall from static images, video, and live footage, enabling fully automated, individualized testing in the wild.\nC_LIO_LIWe integrated a version of this model into a closed-loop touchscreen-reward pipeline that detects an approaching monkey, presents a basic learning task, and automatically delivers food rewards based on the monkeys responses.\nC_LIO_LIWild capuchins rapidly habituated and learned touchscreen-reward associations, showing that AI-enabled touchscreens provide a scalable field method for deploying lab-style cognitive tests and mapping individual differences across tasks, species, and sites.\nC_LI", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Identifying old items during recognition memory tasks elicits widespread cortical responses. Recent results suggest that a distributed network, labeled the Parietal Memory Network (PMN), responds to old items potentially reflecting mnemonic familiarity. An independent, parallel line of evidence suggests that the same network responds to salient stimuli in non-mnemonic contexts, referring to the network as the Salience Network (SAL). Here we examined responses during old-new recognition and non-mnemonic detection tasks in intensively scanned individuals to directly contrast component processes related to mnemonic familiarity with more general processes associated with target detection. In an oddball detection paradigm devoid of traditional memory demands, SAL/PMN was robustly activated. SAL/PMN was also activated by old words in a standard old-new recognition task, thus reproducing both previously reported effects. In a critical oppositional contrast, recognition was examined when the task was to detect uncommon old words versus when the task was to detect uncommon new words. SAL/PMN was activated during the detection of targets even when those targets were new items, consistent with a response to the task relevance of the targets not mnemonic familiarity. Exploratory analyses further suggested that a right-lateralized network, referred to as Frontoparietal Network B (FPN-B), responds to mnemonic familiarity. These results revise our understanding of brain networks contributing to old-new recognition separating component processes common to many forms of target detection task from processes preferentially associated with mnemonic history.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

In this study, we tested how individual fecundity dynamics influence vulnerability of female fecundity to the deleterious environmental factors. We injured Drosophila melanogaster females at various moments during periods before and after mating. Injuries are prevalent in nature and provide a punctuated stimulus, making them particularly well suited to study their connection with the dynamics of reproduction. Our aim was to determine periods of vulnerability and impact of wounds on female fitness resulting from the change. The observed fecundity dynamics exhibited a high early peak in offspring production, suggesting that early after mating females might be particularly vulnerable to environmental conditions.

J.; Hsueh, Y.-P.", "abstract": "Pleurotus ostreatus, a widely cultivated edible oyster mushroom, is an ecologically versatile species with applications in biotechnology, agriculture, and food production. It functions as a decomposer and in nutrient-limited conditions it enhances its survival by using a potent toxin to prey on nematodes. Its adaptability is further regulated by sexual reproduction, which follows a tetrapolar mating system governed by two unlinked, multiallelic loci, matA and matB. The two mating-compatible monokaryotic strains PC9 and PC15, derived from the parental dikaryon strain N001, exhibit significant physiological differences. PC9 grows robustly in laboratory conditions, whereas PC15 grows more slowly, making PC9 the preferred strain for research. To advance P. ostreatus as a genetic model, we characterized the mating-type (MAT) loci of both monokaryon strains and developed a congenic strain. We analyzed the MAT loci in multiple P. ostreatus strains, and identified 11 A and 12 B alleles among twelve haplotypes, confirming their multiallelic nature. Using genetic backcrosses, we introgressed the matA and matB loci from PC15 into the PC9 genetic background to generate the congenic strain PC9.15. After sequencing and assembling a high-quality and contiguous genome for PC9.15, we confirmed that the genomes of PC9.15 and PC9 are 99% similar, with the only major difference placed at the matA and matB loci.\n\nAuthor SummaryMushrooms are not just decomposers-they can also be predators. The oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus is an ecologically adaptable species that thrives by breaking down plant material and preying on nematodes using a potent toxin that triggers rapid paralysis of nematode prey. In addition to its ability to switch from saprophyte to predator, another feature contributing to the ecological success of Pleurotus is its reproductive strategy. P. ostreatus reproduces sexually through a tetrapolar mating-type system, governed by two unlinked mating loci, matA and matB. These loci determine mating compatibility and contribute to genetic diversity, yet their precise structure and allelic diversity remain unclear. In this study, we characterized the matA and matB loci in P. ostreatus strains PC9 and PC15 and analyzed MAT loci across multiple strains, confirming their multiallelic nature. To enhance P. ostreatus as a genetic model, we developed the congenic strain PC9.15 by introgressing MAT alleles from PC15 into the PC9 genetic background through genetic backcrosses. Genome sequencing confirmed that PC9.15 closely matches the genome of PC9, except at the MAT loci. This study expands our understanding of mating-type diversity in P. ostreatus, introduces PC9.15 as a valuable tool for genetic studies and controlled crosses, and facilitates the development of P. ostreatus as a model system for fungal biology.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Hippocampal subfield segmentation on in vivo MRI is generally guided by postmortem reference material, which has been limited by small sample sizes that preclude comprehensive characterization of subfield border locations and their variability. Addressing this, we characterized hippocampal subfield border variability in two ultra-high-resolution postmortem MRI datasets with combined annotated histological sections, including cases with and without dementia. We examined: 1) the order of appearance and disappearance of subfields along the long axis of the hippocampus; 2) the order of appearance and disappearance of subicular subregions; 3) the medial-lateral position of subicular subregional boundaries along the hippocampal body; 4) the location of the CA3 relative to hippocampal head digitations; 5) the subfield borders in the hippocampal body relative to a volume proportion of the dark band; and 6) the association of hippocampal length and subiculum-CA1 border location with diagnosis, demographic factors, and factors related to postmortem imaging. Our findings reaffirmed that there is a consistent order of appearance and disappearance of subfields in the hippocampal head and tail, respectively. The subicular subregions exhibited a \"first in, last out\" order of appearance and disappearance, and pre/parasubiculum consistently occupied half of the subicular complex in coronal slices throughout the hippocampal body. Hippocampal head digitations were not a reliable landmark for CA3 appearance, but SRLM proportionality did offer a potentially consistent approach for estimating CA2 and CA3 subfield borders in relation to the hippocampal border. No clear relationship was found between the anatomical features and diagnosis, demographic factors, and factors related to postmortem imaging.

Permeable (sandy) sediments, which cover half of the continental shelf worldwide, are potential sources of N2O due to increasing nutrient inputs from urbanization and agriculture. Yet, the microbial processes determining N2O emissions in these dynamic and unique ecosystems remain understudied. Here, we combined environmental measurements, bacterial cultivation, and genomic analyses to understand the microbes and processes controlling N2O cycling in permeable sediments from Port Phillip Bay (Australia). We established a genomic resource comprising 249 metagenome-assembled genomes and 95 new isolate genomes. Genome-based metabolic reconstructions and culture-based gas measurements revealed diverse bacteria in these sediments produce N2O through incomplete denitrification pathways. However, these bacteria co-occurred with highly abundant clade II N2O-reducing bacteria from the Flavobacteriaceae family. Kinetic profiling revealed both clade II nosZ flavobacterial isolates and whole sand communities exhibit a low affinity for N2O, contrary to previous reports that clade II N2O reducers generally have a high substrate affinity. This indicates adaptation to the high residence times of N2O within production and consumption zones in the sands. Collectively, these N2O reducers remove most N2O produced in permeable sediments, supporting lower-than-expected coastal emissions predicted by biogeochemical models. We conclude that permeable sediments host specialised microbial communities that mitigate N2O emissions and buffer marine nitrogen cycling amid rising nutrient pollution.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Yet, how these processes interact with bottom-up frequency-specific stimulus drive, and how they are organised across cortical depth, remains unclear. Using ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (7T fMRI), participants listened to stochastic tone sequences whose repetition structure and predictability varied over time. For each voxel independently, we used computational modelling to estimate responses for stimulus drive, repetition suppression, and expectations. We then partitioned the unique and shared variance of these components to estimate their relative importance in modulating BOLD activity across cortical layers in auditory cortices. Expectation-related signals explained most unique variance in deep (infagranular) layers, in line with accounts that place internal model representations and belief updates in deeper cortical populations. Variance jointly explained by stimulus drive and expectation was instead strongest in superficial layers, consistent with these compartments expressing computations that combine bottom-up input with top-down predictions, such as prediction error signalling. Finally, repetition suppression accounted for variance uniformly across depth, suggesting an adaptation-like mechanism that modulates responsiveness without a clear laminar bias. Together, the data suggest that deep layers contain content-specific predictive models, superficial layers register prediction-input alignment, and repetition suppression provides a depth-invariant, local gain control that complements predictive processing.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Epigenetic DNA base modifications are a key regulator of gene expression, which in mammalian genomes predominantly occur in CpG contexts and are disproportionately distributed in regulatory regions like promoters. Chromatin-associated proteins and transcription factors work in tandem with these modifications to further control gene regulation. Given the interplay of these factors, mapping DNA base modifications concurrently with protein-DNA occupancy is therefore critical to interpreting the epigenome. Current multi-modal mapping methods employ DNA methyltransferases that mark accessible protein-unbound DNA in non-CpG contexts. However, the overlap of this exogenous DNA methylation with naturally occurring modifications can confound readouts and significantly limit compatibility with methods to simultaneously read epigenetic states. To circumvent these limitations, we explored the possibility of introducing an unnatural DNA base modification as an alternative label for protein occupancy. Here, we report our efforts to rationally engineer non-CpG-specific DNA carboxymethyltransferases, characterize their neomorphic activity, and assess DNA carboxymethylation as a reporter of protein occupancy on DNA. We find that DNA carboxymethylation of cytosines in GpC contexts shows broad compatibility with the most widely used epigenetic detection methods and reliably reports on protein occupancy state.

To overcome this discrimination/applicability tradeoff, here we developed a cumulative cgMLST approach, where sets of core loci conserved within nested phylogenetic entities are added. We illustrate this approach using the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (KpSC), for which a widely used cgMLST scheme (KpSC-cgMLST) comprises only 629 genes.\n\nMethodsWe created non-redundant cgMLST schemes for the individual species K. pneumoniae sensu stricto (Kpn-cgMLST scheme), and its multidrug resistant sublineages (SLs) SL147 and SL307. To extract core genes, we used 37,874 genome assemblies originating from over 80 countries worldwide. A methodology was set to filter redundant loci before importing them into the genotyping tool BIGSdb, where they were combined into schemes together with preexisting loci conserved at higher phylogenetic levels. The performance of the cumulative cgMLST schemes was evaluated on previously published datasets and on novel data from an inter-hospital outbreak of SL307.\n\nResultsThe Kpn-cgMLST, SL147 and SL307 schemes comprise 2752, 852, and 947 additional loci, respectively.

Compared to the KpSC scheme used alone, pairwise allelic distances among isolates increased on average 5.6-fold using the Kpn scheme, and further by 20% and 30% using the SL147 and SL307 schemes, respectively.

Since its discovery, ONNV has caused several outbreaks in Africa, manifesting clinically as fever, rash, and joint/muscle pain lasting months. Currently, we have a limited understanding of ONNV infection and disease in relevant animal models, which restricts the evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics. In 1967, Binn et al. reported that infection of rhesus macaques (RMs) with ONNV failed to induce viremia in two animals. This may be attributed to the potential attenuation of the virus through extensive passaging. To mitigate this issue, we constructed an infectious clone from the sequence of ONNV-UVRI0804 (ONNV0804), a 2017 clinical isolate from a febrile patient in Uganda. This strain demonstrated high pathogenicity in immunocompetent mice, resulting in an earlier and more severe onset of disease and significantly higher viremia compared to a highly passaged control strain ONNVUgMP30. In the current study, three male and three female rhesus macaques were subcutaneously inoculated with ONNV0804. All animals became viremic at 2 days post inoculation (dpi). Both classical and nonclassical monocytes were activated (CD169+), peaking at 3 dpi, which corresponded with the peak of viremia. Additionally, CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory T cells and memory B cells began proliferating in peripheral blood by day 7, peaking at day 10, which also corresponded to the timing of neutralizing antibody development, indicating a robust adaptive immune response to ONNV0804. Finally, key clinical disease manifestations were recapitulated, including lymphadenopathy and histological features of early-stage arthritis. Taken together, rhesus macaque infection with ONNV0804 clinical isolate is a promising model for investigating immune responses to alphaviruses and evaluating vaccines to protect against future epidemics.\n\n2. Author summaryOnyong-nyong virus (ONNV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes fever, rash, and prolonged joint and muscle pain, similar to chikungunya virus and other arthritogenic alphaviruses. Despite its capacity to cause outbreaks in Africa, ONNV remains understudied, and there are currently no approved vaccines or therapeutics to prevent or treat infection and disease. A major barrier to advancing ONNV research has been the lack of suitable animal models to study the virus and investigate host immune responses. We engineered an ONNV infectious clone of a recent clinical isolate sequenced from a patient in Uganda (ONNV0804) that causes robust infection and disease in immunocompetent mice. In the current study, we provide data demonstrating that this contemporary ONNV strain infects rhesus macaques. Notably, rhesus macaques developed detectable viremia, rash, lymphadenopathy, joint and muscle inflammation, and strong innate and adaptive immune responses following subcutaneous ONNV0804 infection. These findings suggest that ONNV0804 infection in macaques is a promising model for studying ONNV pathogenesis and immunity. This model will be instrumental for evaluating future vaccine and therapeutic candidates aimed at preventing ONNV infection and related viral disease.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

In biomedical research, assistive agents could make this reasoning accessible to human scientists: for example, intermediate conclusions could be critically evaluated based on shared reasoning and sycophancy - the tendency to affirm a users claims regardless of their validity - could be mitigated. However, this interaction requires an alignment of reasoning between agents and humans that is difficult when multiple data modalities are considered, for example in single-cell biology, where human scientists reason through computational notebooks that contain code, results, and text. To address this issue, we developed kai, an agentic AI that iteratively generates analyses in computational notebooks. We find that kai can flexibly use multiple tools in sequence to solve complex cell type annotation problems. Compared with one-shot generation, kai demonstrates improved robustness against code errors and sycophancy, improved reasoning, and the ability to formulate and address questions on data. kais design is model-agnostic and, therefore, scales directly with advancements in large language models.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

While Drosophila melanogaster has been the most widely used species owing to its versatile genetic tools, comparative studies also take advantage of the rich evolutionary, ecological, and behavioural diversity of Drosophilidae. This model system has only benefitted from the sequencing of hundreds of genomes assembled to chromosome level, and rich array of publicly-available datasets. However, labs that typically use just D. melanogaster can have difficulties adopting other species into their experiments due to unique dietary needs and care regimens. While dedicated research groups can rear dozens of fly species, this often requires preparing a variety of food media, which can be logistically taxing. In this study, we report an agar food recipe that we have used to rear >70 species of Drosophilidae (Prop recipe). This list includes ecological specialists such as D. sechellia, major pest species including D. suzukii, cactophiles, slime flux feeders, detritivores, and even mushroom-feeding species of the Quinaria and Testacea groups. This food recipe uses only standard powdered ingredients and molasses, and is already in use by one commercial transgenic injection provider. We provide life history parameters for dozens of species reared on this recipe, including comparisons in a subset of species across a variety of diets, finding fly fitness to be comparable or better on the Prop recipe among tested species. We further provide comparative data for 42 species after systemic infection by Acetobacter bacteria. However, unexpectedly, we found a striking interaction of diet and the microbiota that impacts susceptibility to infection in species-specific fashion. Our results suggest certain experiment types may be impacted by diet due to the microbiome that the diet itself supports. By providing rearing advice, life history parameters, and this infection dataset and experience, we hope to enable researchers to take advantage of the diversity of Drosophila as a model system for evolutionary research.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

M.; Ro, A.; Dunn, B.; Armstrong, J. O.; Dunham, M. J.", "abstract": "The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the workhorse of the brewing industry. Brewers have domesticated a vast array of different strains with traits that complement the beers they wish to brew. Yet, some domesticated strains also harbor traits that are undesirable. One example of an undesirable trait in brewing strains is the mother-daughter separation defect (MDSD). MDSDs are a reproductive flaw present in a widely used brewing strain, London Ale III. MDSDs cause cells to form large clusters, possibly leading to the known requirement for more headspace during London Ale III fermentations that result in a lower fermentative yield. Because MDSDs can be caused by mutations to a number of genes, targeted genetic approaches to reduce MDSDs are experimentally challenging, especially for a tetraploid strain like London Ale III. To improve MDSDs in this strain, we employed experimental evolution and passaged populations from three biological replicates for over 200 generations to generate three independent evolved strains that form fewer clusters than the ancestral strain, as seen by microscopy. To confirm these results, we used flow cytometry to measure the average size of the clusters in clones of our evolved replicates and found them to be smaller on average than the ancestor. We also qualitatively assessed the aggregation phenotype using a settling assay and found that our evolved replicates settle slower than the ancestor. Finally, we characterized the mutations in our evolved replicates using whole genome sequencing and identified increased copy numbers of chromosome 1 and chromosome 14 in all three evolved clones. The best-performing strain generated by this project is now available commercially. This project demonstrates how experimental evolution can be used to select against less desirable traits in industrial yeast strains when targeted genetic approaches present considerable challenges. Future research could implement a similar approach to improve other traits in widely used brewing and baking strains.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Despite high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) structures, the molecular determinants that stabilize specific CFTR conformations and enable ion conduction remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the human CFTR 3D structure in both the apo and VX-770-bound states, embedded in a heterogeneous lipid bilayer, in order to systematically analyze electrostatic interactions, linking amino acids to each other as well as to anions and membrane lipids. We identified 558 electrostatic interactions between charged and polar amino acid side chains, which we systematically mapped across the CFTR 3D structure. They are organized into specific regions, with a subset showing high frequency and conservation across simulations, suggesting a structural role in stabilizing CFTR architecture. In contrast, more transient electrostatic interactions were detected in dynamic regions potentially linked to conformational transitions or other functional roles. Irregularities in transmembrane (TM) helices often incorporate amino acids involved in electrostatic interactions. Many basic and polar residues involved in electrostatic interactions also engaged in anion coordination, underscoring their contribution to ion conduction. In addition, some showed selective interactions with cholesterol and phosphatidylserine, revealing spatially organized lipid binding, particularly at the level of the lasso and in the vicinity of the VX-770 binding site, which may mark regions important for allosteric communication. VX-770 binding preserved the global architecture of the electrostatic interaction networks but induced subtle shifts, reinforcing specific salt bridges and enhancing anion contacts, especially around a portal displayed between TM10/TM12. This one is located opposite to the main TM4/TM6 portal, whose morphology and diameter is controlled by a fluctuating salt bridge. Regardless of whether VX-770 is present or not, two exit routes also emerged from these MD simulations. Altogether, our integrative analysis highlights how dynamic electrostatic networks, together with ion and lipid interactions support CFTR's structural plasticity and functional modulation, offering molecular insights into potentiation mechanisms and into the specific evolution of CFTR in the ABC transporter superfamily.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Numerous genes have been linked to DSB repair for the first time in recent genome-wide perturbation studies assessing effects on mutational outcomes. However, the functional roles of most such genes remain poorly understood. Evidence from other studies shows that related genes similarly modulate the frequency of specific mutational outcomes following DSB repair, but analysis has largely ignored the multiplicity of gene functions and cross-talk between pathways. Here, we infer functional roles for candidate genes based on knockout mutational spectra by identifying mutational signatures shared with known genes and then mapping them to DSB repair functions. Signatures are identified using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to reflect functional multiplicity and cross-talk. We generated mutational spectra for mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells at three target sites across CRISPR knockouts of 307 known and 459 candidate DSB repair genes. Analysis using NMF revealed four mutational signatures associated with homology-directed repair (HDR), microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), and the initiation and ligation components of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Signatures suggested that candidate genes Dbr1 and Hnrnpk could influence MMEJ and Fanconi anaemia (FA), and that loss of core NHEJ components (e.g. MRN complex or Ku proteins) could shift repair preference towards Ku-independent NHEJ. These findings demonstrate the utility of NMF for characterizing the contribution of genes to repair pathways and provide a foundation to discover new gene functions in DSB repair.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we applied our previously validated RAS84 transcriptional signature to stratify LUAD patient cohorts and dissect the immune landscape associated with RAS signalling. We report that tumours with elevated RAS activity exhibited features of immune priming, including increased immune infiltration, interferon response, and immune checkpoint gene expression, and showed improved progression-free survival in an independent cohort of patients treated with anti-PD-1. Yet, in both LUAD tumours and cell lines, RAS activity also correlated with elevated immunosuppressive interstitial adenosine mediated by transcriptional regulation of several components of the adenosinergic pathway. In orthotopic pre-clinical models of high-RAS activity lung tumours, blocking adenosine signalling delayed tumour growth and improved response to anti-PD-1 and KRAS inhibition, with a significant effect on innate immunity. This study reveals a dual role for RAS signalling in tumour progression, fostering a pro-immunogenic environment whilst simultaneously dampening anti-tumoural immunity via mechanisms including extracellular adenosine accumulation. Stratifying patients based on RAS transcriptional activity, rather than genetic alterations alone, could inform immunotherapy strategies and improve clinical outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

We find that most mRNAs begin translation on single ribosome (monosome) with long tails that progressively shorten as additional ribosomes are recruited. In contrast, highly expressed housekeeping genes are translated efficiently on monosomes and possess intrinsically short poly(A) tails. Furthermore, we find that translationally repressed transcripts, such as those retaining introns, are trapped on monosomes with long tails. Pharmacological inhibition of translation induces global poly(A) tail lengthening, confirming that deadenylation is coupled to ongoing translation. These findings reveal a dynamic system where the poly(A) tail integrates mRNA status with translational fate, defining the monosome as a central hub for post-transcriptional control.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Across tissues and conditions, stAge uncovers robust spatial gradients of biological age and shows that injury and neurodegeneration induce pronounced age acceleration, with stronger responses in older organisms and partial normalization during recovery.

Despite the extensive literature and genetic data available for constructing these databases, they often lack sufficient biological context. Current curation methods rely on labour-intensive expert manual curation from literature and datasets, as well as automated methods that are not context-aware. Therefore, there is a significant opportunity to utilize publicly available literature to bridge this gap and create more precise gene sets.

Our approach consists of two pipelines. One verifies the inclusion of genes in a gene set by proof of evidence in the abstracts showing the association between the gene and the gene set. The second pipeline parses through the abstracts to identify genes not already included in the gene set for potential inclusion. To evaluate the proposed approach, we reconstructed a random selection of gene sets within the Human Ontology Phenotype (HPO). Our analysis shows that 437 of these gene sets have a similarity of 83.59% when compared to the original HPO gene sets, aligning well with the current HPO database.

In this study, we employed a Hill-type muscle-tendon-complex (MTC) model to predict the maximally attainable AMPO of human m. quadriceps femoris for various imposed periodic knee joint movements. Based on these predictions, we selected one set of conditions predicted to yield identical maximally attainable AMPO despite substantial variations in knee joint movements and another set of conditions predicted to yield substantial variations in maximally attainable AMPO. In the experiment, periodic knee joint movements were fully imposed by a knee dynamometer. Participants were instructed to maximise AMPO and, to this end, received visual feedback on their cumulative mechanical work throughout each cycle. Experimental data closely matched predictions derived from the Hill-type MTC model, confirming the validity of the model. Model predictions showed a substantial influence of knee joint movement on the maximally attainable AMPO. Specifically, predictions revealed a strong interaction between cycle frequency and knee joint excursion: increasing one necessitates a decrease in the other to maximise AMPO. Even more interestingly, m. quadriceps femoris should spend about 80% of the cycle duration while shortening, independent of cycle frequency and/or knee joint excursion.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

CEACAM1 promotes receptor-mediated insulin uptake to be degraded in hepatocytes in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Its deletion/inactivation causes hyperinsulinemia-driven insulin resistance, steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. CEACAM2, the dominant CEACAM protein in murine KPTCs, shares a high homology with CEACAM1. Thus, we examined whether it regulates renal insulin disposal to maintain renal homeostasis. KPTCs derived from Ceacam2 null mice (Cc2-/-) exhibited lower receptor-mediated insulin uptake. Combined with the gradual decline in CEACAM1-dependent hepatic insulin clearance, impaired renal insulin clearance contributed to chronic hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance starting at 10 months of age in Cc2-/- males. This was followed by proteinuria and reduced glomerular filtration rate in association with glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage. Increased collagen deposition in Cc2-/- kidneys could be mediated in part, by hyperinsulinemia-driven activation of the 5 and {beta}1 integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathways. Together, the data demonstrated that loss of CEACAM2 impaired renal insulin clearance that contributed to hyperinsulinemia and resultant insulin resistance, followed by kidney dysfunction and renal fibrosis. This study provided an in vivo demonstration of the regulation of kidney function by insulin clearance along the liver-kidney axis.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

However, training SNNs is difficult due to the non-differentiable nature of the most common spiking models: integrate-and-fire neurons. This study investigates if some of the difficulty in training SNNs arises from the use of integrate-and-fire neurons, rather than smoother alternatives, like conductance-based neurons. To that end, we considered networks of Morris-Lecar (ML) neurons, a conductance-based neuron model which is differentiable. Networks were built using kinetic synaptic models that smoothly link presynaptic voltage dynamics directly to postsynaptic conductance changes, ensuring that all components remain fully differentiable. Switching to biophysically detailed models of synapses and neurons enabled direct end-to-end training through Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). Biophysically detailed networks were successfully trained on image classification, regression, and time series prediction tasks. These results demonstrate the feasibility of employing biophysically detailed differentiable point neuron models to create SNNs that function as more accurate paradigms for the study of neural computations and learning. Further, this work confirms that some aspects of the difficulty in translating gradient-based learning algorithms from machine learning may arise from model choice, rather than SNNs being intrinsically difficult to train.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Emerging research increasingly implicates the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in cognition, yet its role in cognitive flexibility is inadequately understood. Methods: We conducted a double-masked trial with N=60 healthy adults aged 18-50. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single 50 mg dose of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, or placebo. Following a waiting period, participants completed a task-switching paradigm as a measure of cognitive flexibility, which required dynamically categorizing arrows based on location or direction. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine group (losartan vs. placebo), task (location vs. direction), and switch (switching vs. repeating a task) effects on reaction time (RT) and accuracy independently. A composite bin score was also computed, integrating both RT and accuracy data. Results: All participants displayed the expected switch costs. While participants on losartan exhibited numerically superior RTs and accuracy, losartan did not significantly improve task-switching performance relative to placebo. This was confirmed by the bin score analysis, which indicated no benefit of losartan when RT and accuracy were considered together. An exploratory probe suggested that losartan improved accuracy on direction switch trials, indicating a potential drug effect under specific cognitive conditions. Conclusion: Overall, we found no significant benefits of losartan on task-switching in healthy adults. Our results may be explained by ceiling effects in our sample, which could have hindered the detection of group differences, or possibly reflect a negligible role for the RAS in cognitive flexibility.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

H.; Kline, K. A.", "abstract": "Bacterial infections often occur in polymicrobial biofilms where nutrient limitation and interspecies interactions can profoundly shape microbial physiology. Enterococcus faecalis can antagonize Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth under conditions of iron limitation, a known host defense mechanism. We report here that this growth antagonism uncovers surviving P. aeruginosa cells capable of surviving antibiotic challenge, including ampicillin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, when grown in iron-restricted biofilms with E. faecalis. Transcriptomic profiling of P. aeruginosa revealed a distinctive response characterized by broad downregulation of biosynthetic, metabolic, and virulence pathways, alongside selective induction of membrane remodeling proteins, transport systems, and biofilm-associated genes. Induction of arnT in P. aeruginosa, required for lipid A modification, correlated with enhanced antibiotic survival to ampicillin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. Additionally, the diguanylate cyclase SiaD and efflux transporter MfsC in P. aeruginosa were implicated in decreased antibiotic susceptibility to the same antibiotics above. This transcriptional response was unique to the dual stress of iron deprivation and microbial competition with E. faecalis, illustrating how interspecies interactions can simultaneously inhibit and protect P. aeruginosa, shedding light on potential persistence mechanisms in iron-limited polymicrobial environments.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis study addresses antibiotic susceptibility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major opportunistic ESKAPE pathogen, within polymicrobial biofilms and under host-relevant iron-restricted conditions. Polymicrobial biofilm-associated infections are notoriously difficult to treat due to complex interspecies interactions and increased antibiotic resistance. We demonstrate that Enterococcus faecalis not only antagonizes P. aeruginosa growth under iron limitation but also induces a unique transcriptional profile enhancing P. aeruginosa survival during antibiotic challenge. This shift involves broad transcriptional reprogramming in P. aeruginosa, characterized by global metabolic downregulation and activation of envelope remodeling pathways, including the arn operon. These findings reveal how interspecies interactions under iron stress can both suppress and protect bacterial pathogens and underscore the importance of considering community context in treatment strategies for persistent infections.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Automation of this process is therefore crucial for accurate and fast detection and analysis. To this end, in this work, we report the development of Deep Pose Tracker (DPT), an end-to-end deep learning model designed to automate the analysis of posture dynamics and locomotion behaviour of C. elegans. This YOLO (You Only Look Once)-based model enables automatic detection and tracking of these worms while measuring essential behavioural features like motion speed, orientation, forward or reverse locomotion and complex body bends like omega turns. In addition, it includes eigenworm decomposition in order to analyze different body shapes that these tiny worms make during their motion, and represent the overall posture dynamics in a low-dimensional space. Our DPT model can generate highly accurate data, with very high inference speed while being user-friendly.

We characterize these enzymes in vitro, and additionally, we reconstitute stemmadenine acetate biosynthesis in Nicotiana benthamiana, comparing the formation of intermediates and shunt products that are produced when previously characterized orthologs from the related plant Catharanthus roseus are used. Ortholog pairs are catalytically indistinguishable, except in the case of GS.

The cerebral cortex is widely believed to compute the requisite kinematic and musculoskeletal dynamics strategies in humans (1-3), even though vertebrates lacking a cerebral cortex achieve sophisticated visuomotor control (4-6), and brainstem circuits executing coordinated eye and head gaze shifts perform analogous sensorimotor computations in non-human primates (7). Here we used a visuomotor reaching task that yields extremely rapid, 'express', target-directed muscle activations (8-10) to test whether a putative subcortical sensorimotor network can compute musculoskeletal dynamics to initiate reaching in humans. We found coordinated express visuomotor responses (EVRs) in task-relevant shoulder, elbow, and bi-articular muscles that reflected both starting posture and target direction in similar patterns to longer latency, presumably cortically mediated, muscle responses. When the task goal was to reach away from the stimulus (i.e. an 'anti-reach'; 11) the EVR involved coordinated muscle activation to initiate the hand toward the stimulus location, opposite to the subsequent goal-directed response. The results suggest a unified theory of visuomotor control for reaching and gaze shifts, in which subcortical systems compute musculoskeletal dynamics based on sensory target information and cortically derived context. The results imply that the transformation from motor goals in extrapersonal space into musculoskeletal dynamics can be performed by neural circuitry in humans that does not involve the sensorimotor cortex.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

J.; Shew, W.; Ching, S.; Hengen, K. B.", "abstract": "There is selective pressure on brains to maximize computational capacity and adaptability in an unpredictable world. Prior work suggests that this demand is satisfied by a regime called criticality, which has emerged as a powerful, unifying framework for understanding how computation can arise in biological systems. However, this framework has been confined to high-dimensional network models. At first glance, this appears irreconcilable with many of the foundational, low dimensional dynamical models that have driven progress in theoretical and computational neuroscience for a century. If criticality is a universal principle, then all models that accurately capture significant aspects of brain function should be constrained by the same fact. Lacking a definition of criticality in low-dimensional dynamical systems, this has been impossible to evaluate. Here, we develop a mathematical definition of criticality that transcends dimensionality by recognizing temporal scale invariance as analogous to spatial scale invariance that defines criticality in large systems. We demonstrate that there are two mechanistically distinct sources of criticality at bifurcations, one deterministic and one that emerges from noise fluctuations. Further, we show that some but not all canonical bifurcations in neural models exhibit criticality, and only a subset of these are biologically plausible. We conduct numerical analyses demonstrating that information processing capacity peaks at critical bifurcations, and evaluate which historically influential neural models contain these bifurcations. Our results establish criticality as a universal neurobiological principle that is accessible to systems of any dimensionality. This unifies disparate modeling approaches under a single computational framework and suggests that optimal information processing emerges not from model-specific mechanisms but from fundamental properties of critical dynamics themselves.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

F.; Marquand, A. F.", "abstract": "Background: Autism is characterised by marked neurobiological and clinical heterogeneity, which often limits the sensitivity of traditional group comparisons. Longitudinal normative modelling offers a way to capture heterogeneity and to describe an individual's brain-behaviour relationships beyond diagnostic labels. Methods: We analysed diffusion MRI scans from 3 waves of the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP). Using normative models of white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) we computed individual deviations relative to age typical norms. Our sample included 544 different individuals across all waves (Wave 1: 344 [autistic 189]; Wave 2: 297 [autistic 162]; Wave 3: 226 [autistic 145]), aged 7-37 years, with mean intervals of ~1.5 years (W1-W2) and ~6 years (W1-W3). We first tested for group level differences between autism and no-autism and then examined the associations with sensory, adaptive, cognitive, and behavioural measures across development within the autism group. Results: Although mean FA differences between autistic and non-autistic participants were not significant, correlations between individual differences in FA and behaviour across repeated measurements yielded moderate but reproducible results. The cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, callosal fibres (genu and splenium), and the superior longitudinal fasciculus were among the most frequently identified pathways associated with clinical traits. For these circuits, FA values were higher in individuals with better adaptive functioning (VABS) and lower in those reporting sensory processing (SSP) difficulties. Findings were mixed for associations between FA and symptom severity (ADOS). The largest cross-sectional signal appeared at Wave 2, and although some of the same circuitry re-appeared over about 7.5 years from Wave 1 to Wave 3, effect sizes remained modest and variable, consistent with heterogeneity and power differences across waves, but still pointing to a stable white matter tract pattern. Conclusions: Autism's white-matter organisation reflects a dimensional and individually patterned architecture rather than a categorical distinction. Stable, person-specific deviations from shared neurodevelopmental pathways are linked to behavioural variation among autistic individuals. Longitudinal normative modelling therefore provides a practical approach to understand and quantify this heterogeneity.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Notably, psoriasis is an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality, particularly in severe disease. However, the cellular mechanisms linking psoriasis to cardiovascular disease have not yet been identified. To address this gap, we investigated systemic markers of inflammasome signaling and innate immune activation in patients with psoriasis. Whole blood was collected from 43 patients, including active psoriasis (mild-to-moderate disease) without clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, inactive psoriasis (minimal disease activity), patients receiving anti-TNF- therapy, and 19 BMI-matched healthy controls. Multiparametric spectral flow cytometry was performed to profile inflammasome signaling, and mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to obtain unbiased phenotyping of circulating immune cells. Classical monocytes from patients with active psoriasis exhibited heightened NLRP3 protein expression and caspase-1 activity upon brief physiological stimulation, responses absent in inactive psoriasis and healthy controls. Mechanistically, active psoriasis demonstrated elevated plasma ATP and increased monocyte expression of P2X7R, a potent NLRP3 activator. TNF- was identified as a key cytokine, selectively upregulating both P2X7R and NLRP3. Baseline proteomics revealed enriched pathways for monocyte extravasation and cell adhesion, suggesting a pro-thrombotic state. Stimulation increased proteins linked to ROS and mitochondrial stress. Monocytes from active psoriasis exhibited increased baseline activation and, upon stimulation, enhanced monocyte-platelet aggregation, both of which were attenuated by inhibition of mitochondrial ROS. Importantly, anti-TNF therapy normalized ATP levels, P2X7R expression, inflammasome responsiveness, monocyte activation, and monocyte-platelet interactions, supporting the restoration of systemic immune homeostasis. In patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis, we demonstrate persistent systemic stress, resulting in inflammasome hyperreactivity and increased monocyte-platelet aggregation in response to minor perturbations in cellular homeostasis.

Although eIF5A shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, its specific nuclear roles remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear yeast eIF5A binds to chromatin and represses gene transcription by preventing the binding of RNA polymerase II. Importantly, chromatin binding and transcriptional repression by eIF5A have a higher impact on genes encoding its own translational targets. The presence of polyproline motifs in genes imposes both translation and transcriptional control by eIF5A.

Proteins of EV subpopulations that were traced in bone cells, but not in non-bone cells, were strongly enriched for pathways involved in cancer progression and metastasis. With super-resolution microscopy we confirmed that EV proteins traced in different targeted cell types co-occurred on specific EV subpopulations.

The viral membrane fuses with a host membrane, either at the cell surface or within endocytic compartments. For endocytic entry, fusion is typically triggered by low pH and often requires proteolytic priming by compartment-specific host proteases, which together define the site and mechanism of fusion and shape viral tropism. Inhibition of the lipid kinase PIKfyve, which generates PI(5)P and PI(3,5)P2 in late endosomes and lysosomes, swells those compartments and blocks infection by a subset of enveloped viruses, including Ebola virus, Marburg virus, coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2), and VSV chimeras bearing Ebola, SARS-CoV-2, or Lassa glycoproteins, while showing minor effects on H1N1 influenza and no effect on VSV or VSV-rabies chimeras. In the work reported here, we have determined the basis for this selectivity. We show that swelling of late endosomes/lysosomes, independent of changes in lipid composition or altered virion trafficking, is sufficient to block virus-endosome fusion and genome release, even when endosomal acidity is preserved. Acute PIKfyve inhibition with apilimod or brief hypotonic treatment produced endosomal swelling and impaired infection by interrupting a late endosomal entry step. Imaging by live-cell 3D lattice light-sheet fluorescence microscopy tracked fluorescent virions accumulating and arresting in late endosomes prior to fusion, and single-cell, single-round assays confirmed loss of infectivity. These data support a simple biophysical mechanism: endo-lysosomal swelling, likely increasing endosomal membrane tension, creates an energy barrier to fusion and genome release. Inducing such swelling may offer a general strategy to inhibit viruses that depend on late endosomal entry.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

During assembly, filament curvature must match the cell diameter, yet how curvature is encoded in FtsZ remains unclear. Using in vitro reconstitution with purified proteins and supported lipid bilayers, we identify FtsZ's intrinsically disordered C-terminal linker (CTL) as a curvature tuner that determines the Z-ring diameter. Increasing CTL charge segregation ({kappa}) progressively reduces Z-ring diameter without altering treadmilling dynamics, monomer turnover, or GTPase activity, indicating that {kappa} modulates filament curvature rather than polymerization kinetics. Linker-dilution experiments, in which wild-type FtsZ is mixed with a CTL-deletion mutant ({Delta}CTL), further show that inter-CTL electrostatic interactions straighten filaments, while weakening these contacts increases curvature and compacts rings. To test whether this mechanism is conserved, we analyzed 4,603 prokaryotic FtsZ sequences and found that CTL charge segregation quantified by {kappa} , but not CTL length, fraction of charged residues, or net charge per residue, correlates with cell width: at low {kappa}, cells show a broad range of widths, whereas high {kappa} values exclude wide cells. Co-expression of {Delta}CTL variants in vivo perturbs Z-ring positioning and impairs growth, consistent with a curvature mismatch and defects during assembly.

Here, we identify persistent transcriptional suppression of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and metabolic rewiring in FSHD muscle biopsies and myotubes. Using DUX4-inducible human myogenic cells, we show that DUX4 target gene activation is accompanied by mitochondrial function impairment and Caspase 9-mediated apoptosis. Reverse electron transfer (RET) at complex I is the dominant oxidative stress generating mechanism in FSHD muscle cells. RET-driven mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) are the trigger for oxidative stress and apoptosis, which is a unique feature of FSHD mitochondria. Pharmacological inhibition of RET suppresses mitoROS, reduces Caspase 9 activation, and rescues abnormal myogenesis in FSHD cell lines. Importantly, DUX4 is non-toxic in oxidative phosphorylation-deficient human myogenic cells. Our findings identify the mitochondrial respiratory chain as a key mediator of DUX4 toxicity and highlight RET inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for FSHD.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Recently, pathology foundation models have emerged as powerful tools in computational pathology. In this study, we aimed to develop a computational tool capable of identifying TLS across different cancer types. To this end, we utilized multiple pathology foundation models, along with the ImageNet-pretrained ResNet50 as a baseline, to identify TLS in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and a licensed Real-World Evidence (RWE) cohort. Both pathologist-annotated and transcriptomic signature-based TLS outcomes were employed for performance assessment. Pathologist-identified TLS-positive tumors showed higher expression of TLS signatures in both diseases. Among the models tested, PLIP and CTransPath exhibited strong performance in identifying TLS within PDAC samples (AUC = 0.94 and 0.89, respectively). However, all models struggled in the analysis of HNSCC, likely due to the increased heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite their overall utility in detecting TLS in PDAC, all foundation models demonstrated poor performance in predicting transcriptomic signature-based outcomes in both PDAC and HNSCC. This suggests that TLS signatures may reflect broader or more transient aspects of TLS biology, whereas pathology-based assessment anchors on visible morphological features, more closely aligned with the focus of foundation model training. These findings highlight the potential of advanced pathology foundation models for TLS detection and broader tumor immune profiling tasks. These models can also be utilized on routinely collected patient biosamples with nominal costs. However, further refinement is needed to enhance their utility in tumors with more complex TME. Additionally, the identification of transcriptomics-based biomarkers from H&E images remains a significant challenge, despite advancements in digital pathology.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Chronic Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is the leading risk factor for GC; however, decreasing HP prevalence means it is unlikely the cause of rising incidence of early-onset GC. Autoimmunity, which is more prevalent in women, has been proposed as a contributing factor. As autoimmunity prevalence increases, HP and gastric autoimmunity are likely to converge within one individual. This study aimed to examine how combinatorial HP infection and autoimmunity affect tumorigenesis and the immune landscape. Methods A mouse model mimicking human CTLA4 insufficiency and its risk of autoimmunity-driven GC development, CTLA4KD, was infected with HP strain PMSS1 by oral gavage. Tumorigenesis was histologically assed. Hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells were analyzed using 40-color spectral flow cytometry. Human PBMCs were co-cultured with HP, followed by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR for gene expression of sorted PBMC subsets. Results HP infection in CTLA4KD mice advanced dysplasia and increased tertiary lymphoid structures within the gastric mucosa. Loss of E-Cadherin and DMBT1 was exacerbated in the combinatorial setting of autoimmunity and HP infection. In the innate immune system HP and autoimmunity showed an additive effect in systemic NK cell decreases. In the adaptive immune system, HP and autoimmunity cooperatively elevated the proportion of CD4+Foxp3- cells expressing the transcription factor Helios, persisting 6-8 months post infection. The Helios-expressing CD4 cells co-expressed inhibitory markers PD-1, CD200 and CD39.

Recent evidence suggests that its bioactive constituents can modulate cellular signaling pathways. However, its impact on reproductive physiology, particularly sperm motility, remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of an aqueous P. incarnata formulation on sperm motility and viability, with the goal of evaluating its potential as a plant-based, non-hormonal contraceptive agent. An aqueous extract of P. incarnata was prepared and subjected to phytochemical analysis to quantify polyphenols, flavonoids, and carbohydrate content using standard assays. Antioxidant activity was assessed via free radical scavenging assays. The presence of bioactive macromolecules was confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Goat spermatozoa, isolated from the caudal epididymis, were treated with the formulation. Sperm motility (horizontal and vertical) was evaluated microscopically and spectrophotometrically, respectively. Sperm viability was assessed using standard viability staining. Phytochemical screening revealed high polyphenol (16.85 mg gallic acid equivalent/g) and flavonoid (2.5 mg quercetin equivalent/g) content, along with notable antioxidant activity (87.25%). LC-MS confirmed the presence of diverse plant macromolecules. Treatment with the P. incarnata formulation significantly reduced both horizontal (28.5%) and vertical (20%) sperm motility (both p < 0.0001), while sperm viability remained unaffected. The water solubility of the formulation supports its development as a topical contraceptive gel. The aqueous P. incarnata formulation modulates sperm motility without compromising cell viability, likely via biochemical pathway regulation.

This research provides theoretical support for developing personalised exercise prescriptions based on genetic background to improve lipid health. Methods: This study recruited 245 healthy Han Chinese university students (114 males, 131 females) without regular exercise habits. Participants underwent a standardised 12-week HIIT intervention programme, conducted three times weekly. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were measured before and after the intervention. Genotyping of the KCNC1 gene SNP was performed using the Infinium CGA chip. PLINK software was employed to construct linear regression models (with age, sex, BMI, and baseline lipid levels as covariates) to analyse the association between genetic polymorphisms and changes ({Delta}) in lipid parameters.

Like many Solanaceae species, N. benthamiana develops on its leaf surface capitate glandular trichomes that produce and secrete acyl sugars. We observed that A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 harboring the disarmed Ti plasmid pMP90 induces de novo formation of GTs and increased production of acylsugars when infiltrated in N. benthamiana leaves. In contrast, other strains, such as AGL1 or LBA4404, do not induce GTs. We demonstrate that the presence of the gene coding for the trans-zeatin synthase (tzs) present on pMP90 is responsible for the de novo trichome initiation and that infiltration of cytokinins such as trans-zeatin or benzylaminopurine is sufficient to induce GTs, establishing a direct link between cytokinins and trichome initiation.

This spatial relationship is established by precise anatomical wiring across successive areas, from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the visual cortex. To examine the precision of this topographic arrangement within the long-range projection axons themselves, we recorded retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the mouse optic tract (OT) and mapped their receptive fields (RFs). As expected for a retinotopically organized area, we found that nearby LGN cell pairs had significantly smaller RF distances than distant pairs. In contrast, no such relationship was observed among RGC axons in the OT. Modelling analyses further confirmed that the observed RF distances in the OT were incompatible with any locally retinotopic arrangement. Instead, the OT retained only coarse topography, with ~20 degrees RF deviations or ~45 m axonal displacements from an ideal retinotopic organization. These results demonstrate that the mouse OT lacks fine-scale retinotopy and maintains only broad topographic structure.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Across 16 grapheme-color synesthetes and two matched control groups, pupil responses tracked the brightness of synesthetic colors under constant physical visual input, scaling with self-reported strength. Synesthetic colors elicited pupil dynamics comparable to real colors, dissociating synesthetes from non-synesthetes. These responses emerged too rapidly to reflect imagery and scaled with reported color bright-ness, revealing cross-modally caused genuine perceptual processing. Controls required to generate color associations showed greater effort-linked pupil di-lation than synesthetes or controls who did not report colors, providing evidence for the effortless nature of synesthesia.

Despite considerable progress, there remains insufficient understanding of the link between molecular/cellular substrates of psychedelics and the whole-brain network effects that result. Here we report a study of psychedelic action that focuses on the intermediate spatial scale of local brain regions (<1cm3). We analyzed the effects of classical psychedelics (dimethyltryptamine [DMT], lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], psilocybin) and non-classical psychedelics (nitrous oxide, ketamine) in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that all five drugs reduced regional homogeneity, that is, they disrupted local synchrony, in small-scale brain regions; this disruption occurred extensively in cortical regions and sparsely in subcortical regions. Dynamic analysis of both regional homogeneity and global functional connectivity showed an inverse pattern, with large-scale functional connectivity being enhanced as local synchrony declined. We then conducted dominance analysis to assess the contribution of various neurotransmitter receptors to changes in regional homogeneity. DMT, LSD, and psilocybin showed the 5-HT receptors as the most dominant association; by contrast, regional homogeneity changes attributable to both nitrous oxide and ketamine were most strongly associated with the NMDA receptor. Both neuronal (including interneurons) and non-neuronal cell types were linked to psychedelic-induced changes in synchrony at the level of local brain regions. These data, across five drugs from two drug classes, provide evidence that a diverse set of molecular and cellular events lead to a common outcome of disrupted synchrony in local brain regions, which in turn mediate drug-specific changes in global functional connectivity.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

While ripples are generated intrinsically within the hippocampus, growing evidence suggests that their occurrence is modulated by subcortical regions. Whether the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a subcortical region that directly projects to the hippocampus, regulates ripple activity remains unknown. To investigate this, we optogenetically activated VTA neurons during NREM sleep and recorded ripple activity in the dorsal hippocampus via field recording electrodes. Using cell-type specific excitatory opsin expression in the VTA, we found that activation of glutamatergic (vGlut2+) neurons strongly suppressed ripple incidence. In contrast, activation of GABAergic (vGAT+) neurons produced weak suppression, and activation of dopaminergic (DAT+) neurons showed no effect. During ripple suppression by glutamatergic activation, we observed small but consistent head movements. Trial-by-trial analysis revealed no correlation between head movement and ripple suppression. Furthermore, glutamatergic activation during wakefulness also led to head movement, suggesting that ripple suppression and head movement could be dissociated. Overall, our results suggest that VTA vGlut2+ neurons play a role in head movement and that their activation suppresses hippocampal sharp-wave ripples during NREM sleep, offering a potential way to alter memory consolidation.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

To address this, we engineered the EV-sorting scaffold protein CD63 to include an internal twin-Strep tag, enabling efficient and rapid affinity-based isolation of engineered EVs using Strep technology. Furthermore, coding sequences of POIs were fused to the C-terminus of CD63, allowing functional POIs to be loaded into the lumen of twin-Strep-tagged EVs. Proteomic analysis of isolated EVs demonstrated high purity, with [~]97% of contaminants removed. Importantly, we also observed efficient removal of contaminating virus particles that resemble EVs in size and density.

The fabricated wearable ultrasound patch exhibits a center frequency of 5.05 MHz, a -6 dB bandwidth of 42.58%, and an elastic stretchability of up to 30%. Based on pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler, it calculates the Doppler frequency shift using a slow-time sampling algorithm. In vitro studies showed an absolute percentage error of 4.1% to 12% for constant flow velocity measurements, with actual flow velocities varying between 20 and 100 cm/s. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 3.56 cm/s, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 5.99%. In pulsatile flow experiments, the patch was also able to capture the changing peaks of the velocity waveform, demonstrating its feasibility for continuous blood flow monitoring.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Existing approaches often compare gene co-expression between predefined cell clusters or rely on aligning cells across conditions. These strategies can be suboptimal when changes occur within small subpopulations or when batch effects obscure the underlying biological signal. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCoLo, a framework that identifies genes exhibiting differential co-localization, defined as changes in coordinated expression within localized cell neighborhoods - subsets of highly similar cells in the transcriptomic space. Importantly, DiCoLo does not rely on cell clustering or cross-condition alignment. For each condition, DiCoLo constructs a gene graph using Optimal Transport distances that reflect gene co-localization patterns across the cell manifold. Then, it identifies differential gene programs by detecting changes in connectivity patterns between the gene graphs. We show that DiCoLo robustly identifies differential gene co-localization even under weak signals or complex batch effects, outperforming existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets. When applied to mouse hair follicle development data, DiCoLo reveals coordinated gene programs and emerging cell populations driven by perturbations in morphogen signaling that underlie dermal condensate differentiation. Overall, these results establish DiCoLo as a powerful framework for uncovering localized differential transcriptional coordinated patterns in single-cell data.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Although whole-exome sequencing(WES) offers a cost-effective solution for CNV detection in a clinical setting, it introduces several biases, including those related to sequence length, GC content, and the use of targeting probes. Consequently, estimating exact copy numbers remains challenging, especially for WES data. Here, we present ExactCN, a deep learning-based method for estimation of exact copy numbers from WES data per exon. The architecture integrates convolutional layers that extract local read-depth patterns with transformer encoder blocks that capture genomic context and handle sequencing noise. ExactCN is trained on WES samples from the 1000 Genomes Project, using matching WGS-based calls as semi-ground truth. In benchmarks, ExactCN improves the state-of-the-art integer CNV calling performance by reducing the macro-averaged mean absolute error (MAE) from 0.91 to 0.62 and the macro-averaged root mean squared error (RMSE) from 1.31 to 0.78. It also achieves an overall Pearson correlation of 0.669 and Spearman correlation of 0.550, improving the second-best method by 0.641 and 0.482, respectively. Furthermore, a fine-tuned and specialized version of ExactCN for aggregate CNV detection in clinically important duplicated genes SMN1/2 achieved a macro averaged F1-score of 0.657, and mean absolute error of 0.3.

Predictive algorithms and experimental methods provide the positions of protein residues relative to each other with high accuracy. However, the local quality of the protein structure, including bond lengths, angles, and positions of individual atoms, often lacks the same level of precision. For this reason, protein structures are usually optimised by a force field prior to their application in further research sensitive to structural quality. Protein structure optimisation, however, is computationally challenging. In this paper, we introduce a general method Per-residue optimisation of protein structures: Rapid alternative to optimisation with constrained alpha carbons (PROPTIMUS RAPHAN). Rather than optimising the entire protein structure at once, PROPTIMUS RAPHAN divides the structure into overlapping residual substructures and optimises each substructure individually. This approach results in computational time that scales linearly with the size of the structure. Additionally, we present PROPTIMUS RAPHANGFN-FF, a reference implementation of our method employing a generic, almost QM-accurate force field, GFN-FF.

However, Phyligns performance deteriorates on long and divergent queries because it uses COBS as a k-mer-based prefilter before alignment with Minimap2. Meanwhile, recent k-mer indexes such as Fulgor and Themisto have emerged, but there is no practical methodology for selecting, combining, and parameterizing them for phylogenetically partitioned million-genome search under constraints.\n\nHere, we develop an end-to-end methodology for k-mer matching in phylogenetically compressed bacterial collections. We formalize a matching strategy defined by matching mode, query type, and reference characteristics, and use this to shortlist candidate indexes and benchmark them under space-time trade-offs. As a case study, we address plasmid search over AllTheBacteria, compare multiple index types, and identify configurations optimizing the Pareto frontier of space and speed. Guided by these results, we implement a phylogenetically compressed variant of Fulgor, integrate it into Phylign, and obtain Phylign-Fulgor, a laptop-ready pipeline for million-genome search. On the 661k collection, Phylign-Fulgor makes the prefiltering step [~]4x faster than Phylign-COBS at the cost of a 1.2x larger index.

While previous studies reported that Notch1 and Notch2 exert distinct and sometimes opposing effects in prostate cancer differentiation, the integrated role of Notch pathway activity has not been systematically explored. Here, we identify Notch signaling as a graded Rheostat that governs prostate cancer cell fate transitions. Integrative transcriptomic and functional analyses revealed that intermediate Notch activity maintains a stem-like progenitor state, whereas reduced or elevated signaling drives divergent differentiation trajectories toward luminal or neuroendocrine lineages, respectively. During CRPC progression and enzalutamide resistance, Notch signaling becomes dynamically rewired, peaking in progenitor-like populations that sustain plasticity and survival. Both CRISPR-mediated knockout and pharmacologic inhibition of Notch signaling depleted these progenitor cells and restored enzalutamide sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that the level, rather than the binary presence, of Notch signaling dictates lineage directionality and therapeutic response in CRPC, establishing it as a tunable and actionable driver of resistance.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

The management options considered were traditional conversion management, based on periodic thinning, and alternative conversion, based on anticipated seed cutting and final harvesting, which were compared against natural evolution (unthinned control). Results showed that the differences between natural evolution and traditional conversion were largest in the years immediately after thinning, and then reduced with full canopy (leaf litter and leaf area index) recovery after 10 years.

Methods: We considered a variety of somatic clamp stimulation to drive the activity of biophysical morpho-realistic reconstructed neurons during extracellular alternating stimulation to quantify the sensitivity to the field depending on the nature of cells' activity. Results: Cells sensitivity to alternating current stimulation depended on the type of input used to drive their activity, with a different frequency response for each protocol, with a trend for inhibitory neurons to be more sensitive to higher stimulation frequencies. Even with the same clamp protocol, sensitivity depended on the statistics of the input used.

Here, we show that peripheral nerve injury induces both the recruitment of leukocytes to the DRG meninges and their transcriptional reprogramming across innate (primarily myeloid cells) and adaptive immune compartments. The accumulation of myeloid cells, predominantly neutrophils and classical monocytes, within the DRG meninges originates from local vertebral bone marrow (BM) emergency myelopoiesis, followed by their migration through ossified vertebral channels.

However, the biological role of Gal-3 in circulating tear fluid remains largely unexplored. Similarly, whether Gal-3 engages extracellular glycoproteins in tears to affect downstream biological processes has yet to be investigated. As increased Gal-3 levels in tears are known to correlate with ocular pathologies such as dry eye disease (DED), we sought to elucidate the Gal-3 interactome in tear fluid and uncover biological insights into the function of Gal-3 beyond adhesion to the epithelial cell surface. Here, we combined ELISA, lectin affinity enrichment, mass spectrometry (MS)-based glycoproteomics, and lectin blotting to uncover Gal-3 interactors and their associated glycoepitopes. Overall, we report nearly 100 proteins enriched from tear fluid across 3 different patients, identifying proteins involved in immune response, inflammation, and antimicrobial activity.

We examine how the distribution of free (non-sequestered) protein depends on sequestration cooperativity (monomers, dimers, multimers) and on the timescale separation between sequestration and protein turnover. For non-cooperative sequestration, faster kinetics drive the distribution from a high-noise to a lower-noise gamma form, while the right-tail remains governed by the high-noise limit --- revealing a non-commutativity between tail asymptotics and fast sequestration. For cooperative sequestration, the distribution departs from gamma, exhibiting left skewness or multimodality.

It is unknown if PBN(CGRP) neurons play a role in anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol or after repeated stress. First, to investigate the anxiogenic role of activating PBN(CGRP) neurons in naive conditions, CalcaCRE female and male mice expressing CRE-dependent hM3D(Gq) DREADDs in the PBN were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM). PBN(CGRP) neurons drive phasic activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that synchronizes to anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, a transsynaptic anterograde AAV-based strategy was used in C57BL/6J female and male mice to activate BNST neurons innervated by the PBN projections (BNSTPBN) during EPM. Additionally, PBN(CGRP) neurons and CGRP-innervated BNST cells were measured in experimentally-naive CGRP-DTRGFP female and male mice, to investigate baseline sex-differences. Next, to investigate the impact of PBN(CGRP) inhibition on anxiety-like behavior following chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE), CalcaCRE female and male mice expressing CRE-dependent hM4D(Gi) DREADDs in the PBN were tested in EPM during acute withdrawal. Additionally, mice were exposed to repeated forced swim stress (FSS) paired with PBN(CGRP) inhibition followed by testing in the novelty suppressed feeding task (NSFT), to investigate the role of PBN(CGRP) on anxiety-like behavior after stress in prolonged withdrawal. Activating PBN(CGRP) or BNSTPBN neurons did not change behavior in EPM in either sex. Total PBN(CGRP) and CGRP-innervated BNST cells did not differ between females and males. In acute withdrawal, inhibiting PBN(CGRP) neurons decreased time in the open arm and increased time in the closed arm selectively in females. In prolonged withdrawal, inhibiting PBN(CGRP) neurons during FSS did not affect immobility in either sex, but did subsequently decrease approach frequency and average speed selectively in males. Altogether, the data report the anxiogenic effect of manipulating PBN(CGRP) neurons is stress and sex-specific during alcohol withdrawal.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Altered neuronal activity in the contralesional hemisphere has been documented in both humans and rodent models, yet its role in functional recovery versus maladaptation remains unresolved. Here, we used chronic wide-field calcium imaging to monitor bilateral cortical activity in mice performing a skilled reach-to-grasp task before and days to weeks after stroke. Strokes produced persistent fine motor impairments, which were only partly alleviated by intensive rehabilitative training. While cortical activity was in particular suppressed in the ipsilesional cortex after stroke, training promoted sustained increases in contralesional sensorimotor activity. However, ridge regression analysis of neural and behavioral data indicated that this activity largely reflected compensatory use of the intact paw rather than recovery of the impaired forelimb. Axonal tracing nevertheless revealed enhanced projections from contralesional motor cortex to ipsilesional brainstem nuclei - including the midbrain and pontine reticular nucleus - specifically in trained animals.

The spatial working memory deficits manifested by the aged AD mouse were fully rescued by the FusOLcKO. This outcome was associated with reduced neuronal oxidative damage, preserved presynaptic structures at the plaque niches and a shift in microglia state at the niches in both hippocampus and cortex. In contrast, plaque burden and microglia density were decreased in the hippocampus but not in cortex, uncoupling the neuronal and microglia effects from the amyloid burden.

Although heterogeneous, the most common form of TN is classical TN, characterized by paroxysmal bouts of pain in response to otherwise innocuous stimuli. It is believed that classical TN results from neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve. However, the underlying pathophysiology of TN is not well understood, thus limiting the development of targeted therapies. Current animal models lack translational relevance, particularly in their inability to replicate intradural nerve root compression, a core anatomic component of TN. Methods: We developed a TN mouse model that achieves intradural nerve root compression via a retro-orbital approach confirmed by anatomic dissection and magnetic resonance imaging. To assess behavioral outcomes, we measured orofacial pain through facial wiping and interaction with a reward stimulus. Pharmacological responsiveness was tested using carbamazepine administration. Mechanistic studies included calcium imaging of trigeminal ganglia (TG), electrophysiologic recordings to measure resting membrane potential and rheobase, and immunohistochemical analysis of the TG. Results: The model elicited orofacial neuropathic pain, substantiated by increased facial wiping and reduced interaction with a reward stimulus, behaviors that suggest both spontaneous and evoked pain. Carbamazepine attenuated these behaviors, suggesting pharmacologic relevance to current TN treatment. Calcium imaging showed heightened spontaneous activity in the TG, and electrophysiologic recordings revealed an increased resting membrane potential and a reduced rheobase. Finally, immunohistochemical studies showed infiltration of CD45+ cells, demyelination and an increase in CGRP expression in the TG, supporting the presence of neuroinflammation after nerve root compression.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

We wished to utilize an arthritis model that recapitulates RA pathogenic myeloid cell subsets defined by single cell transcriptome analysis to investigate sex differences in human disease-relevant cell types and related molecular pathways. We developed a computational strategy that rigorously maps scRNAseq-defined mouse arthritis myeloid cells and clusters onto previously defined RA subsets. Synovial myeloid cells in the zymosan-induced arthritis (ZIA) model closely recapitulated four pathogenic RA myeloid cell subsets, strongly supporting the disease-relevance of the ZIA model. ZIA also effectively modeled myeloid cells in immune checkpoint inhibitor arthritis (ICI-A). These RA, ICI-A and ZIA myeloid cells express genes in TNF-NF-kB, PGE2, and IFN-STAT pathways. In ZIA, an induction phase dominated by cell clusters expressing NF-kB and PGE2 pathways transitioned to peak arthritis characterized by cell subsets co-expressing NF-kB and IFN pathways, as occurs in RA and various inflammatory diseases. Female mice exhibited increased arthritis linked with early induction of interferon-stimulated genes and increased expansion of IFN signature-expressing cell subsets.

Our previous findings showed that fedratinib, a potent inhibitor of thiamine transporter (ThTr) 2 and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), reduced thermogenic activity; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Methods: Primary human subcutaneous (SC) and deep neck (DN)-derived adipocytes were treated with dibutyryl (db)-cAMP, fedratinib, or the combination of the two compounds after differentiation. Global transcriptomic analysis was performed by bulk RNA-sequencing. Differentially expressed genes were subjected to pathway enrichment analysis. We also utilized publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets and adiposetissue.org to correlate ThTr2 expression in adipose tissue to clinical parameters of patient cohorts. Amino acid flux was measured by metabolomics. Results and discussion: ThTr2 expression was observed exclusively enriched in the adipocytes cluster within human brown and white adipose tissue. In response to ThTr2 inhibition, the db-cAMP-stimulated upregulation of the canonical thermogenic markers and proton leak respiration, which associates with UCP1-dependent heat generation, was prevented in both adipocyte types. RNA-sequencing found 40 and 41 downregulated genes potentially underlying the metabolic changes in SC and DN-derived adipocytes, respectively, which were involved in various biological pathways, including transcriptional regulation of brown and beige adipocytes differentiation, signaling by interleukins, nicotinamide salvaging, and gene and protein expression by JAK/STAT signaling after interleukin-12 stimulation. The expression of recently identified thermogenesis regulators, such as transglutaminase (TGM) 2 and inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) 1, was also abrogated by ThTr2 inhibition during adrenergic stimulation. Intriguingly, glutamate transporter (GLT) 1 and L-amino acid transporter (LAT) 2 expression was also attenuated by fedratinib, restricting amino acid consumption. Finally, we found that the expression of ThTr2 in human white adipose tissue was inversely correlated with body mass index, waist-hip ratio, leptin secretion, and plasma insulin, glucose, cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels, supporting the importance of thiamine metabolism in adipocyte and metabolic health.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we combined photographic analysis with cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) metabarcoding across ten north-western Mediterranean sites to test, compare, and refine ARMS-based monitoring protocols. We first optimized laboratory procedures (DNA extraction and polymerase choice) and applied the control-driven, replicate-aware VTAM pipeline to minimize false positives and ensure full traceability. We then conducted the first face-by-face comparison of - and {beta}-diversity between imaging and eDNA in which each individual ARMS face was metabarcoded separately rather than pooled. Metabarcoding detected [~]15x higher site-level richness and revealed stronger correlations with geographic distance and environmental gradients, whereas photography provided complementary information on macro-taxa and surface cover. For metabarcoding, processing each face separately yielded much higher richness and markedly stronger {beta}-diversity-distance correlations than with the NOAA pooling protocol, demonstrating that pooling inflates sampling variance resulting in a loss of the ecological signal. Grouping faces into five structural categories offered a more operational alternative while further increasing -diversity and strengthening {beta}-diversity correlations. Overall, our results show that retaining ARMS microhabitat structure is critical for maximizing metabarcoding performance. Using five structural sessile fractions per ARMS combined with a control-driven bioinformatic workflow provides a reproducible, scalable framework for long-term eDNA monitoring and early detection of biodiversity change.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Background: Endothelial cells (ECs) are mechanosensitive and adopt distinct phenotypes in response to hemodynamic forces. These phenotypes are rarely seen in shear-responsive signalling studies because commonly used in vitro platforms rarely reproduce the true scale of vessel geometries or physiologic waveforms. Aim: To determine how the presence and temporal pattern of flow impact endothelial morphology and transcriptional activity in a 3D macrofluidic model. Methods: Idealised vessels were 3D-printed using a water-soluble polyvinyl alcohol filament and cast in polydimethylsiloxane. The polyvinyl alcohol cores were dissolved leaving a polydimethylsiloxane lumen on which HMEC-1 cells were grown and perfused for 24 h under static, continuous flow, or pulsatile flow. Cell morphology was assessed using immunofluorescence. Bulk RNA-seq was performed with Hallmark pathway enrichment using gene set enrichment analysis. Results: Relative to static culture, continuous flow increased cell eccentricity (0.74 vs 0.48, p <0.0001) and reduced variability in cell orientation (-47.1 degrees, p <0.0001). At the transcriptome level, differential gene expression was extensive (continuous vs static: 2,103 genes; pulsatile vs static: 2,643 genes; pulsatile vs continuous: 384 genes). Continuous flow favoured oxidative-metabolic and barrier-maintenance pathways. By contrast, pulsatile shear of the same mean load promoted cell-cycle/checkpoint signalling rather than oxidative-metabolic programmes. Head-to-head, pulsatile flow emphasized MYC proto-oncogene (MYC) and E2F transcription factor (E2F), whereas continuous flow preferentially engaged oxidative phosphorylation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT)-mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) (with higher tumor protein p53 and transforming growth factor-beta) signaling. Conclusion: Under matched mean shear, pulsatile versus continuous flow drive distinct endothelial morphological and transcriptional programs, enriching pathways central to blood vessel function, remodelling, and disease. 3D macrofluidic platforms can replicate flow-specific endothelial cell mechanobiology, providing a translational tool to better understand vascular outcomes.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

By engineering a systematic stability gradient within the M3L2/p66 heterodimeric linker, we generated single-amino-acid variants that exhibit predictable shifts in the temperature window for tube formation and produce tubes with distinct diameters. Notably, the least stable variant uniquely accesses multilayered tube-in-tube architectures. Time-resolved electron microscopy reveals that these hierarchical structures arise through a sequential process involving the initial formation of thin tubes, subsequent wall thickening, and eventual development of nested tubes, highlighting the role of transient linker rearrangements near the thermal transition.

A major factor in these failures is the lack of consideration for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) diversity, with over 30,000 HLA alleles worldwide exhibiting distinct frequencies across ethnic groups and geographic regions. Here, we present a globally representative immunopeptidomics approach that addresses HLA diversity at the earliest stages of vaccine antigen discovery. We established a panel of 30 cell lines from the 1000 Genomes Project that represent 75% of the world's most common HLA alleles. Using a combined computational and experimental approach, we identified 18 common binding motifs (7 MHC class I and 11 MHC class II) shared across 24 cell lines from the panel. We developed an accessible bioinformatic tool that predicts globally presentable antigenic regions from any pathogen proteome by identifying peptides matching these common binding motifs. Validation with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein demonstrated that our method successfully identifies known immunogenic regions, with experimentally detected epitopes showing substantial overlap with predicted regions of interest. Notably, only three cell lines were required to validate highly immunogenic S. enterica targets, including OmpC --a porin with known 100% protective efficacy -- detected across all tested lines. Our approach enables researchers to rapidly screen pathogen proteomes using freely available bioinformatic tools, with optional experimental validation requiring minimal resources. By identifying antigens with broad population coverage before clinical trials begin, this method has the potential to increase vaccine success rates while ensuring equitable protection across diverse populations. The cell line panel, common binding motifs, and bioinformatic workflow are publicly available, providing an accessible pathway for developing vaccines that truly serve global populations.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

By m5C MeRIP-seq and RNA-BisSeq, NSUN2-dependent m5C sites were identified on both the plus and minus viral RNA strands. In NSUN2-KO cells, the m5C modification on vRNAs was reduced, resulting in the production of a large number of deficient interfering particles (DIPs) which had lower vRNA content, imbalanced genome fragments, abnormal morphology and reduced pathogenicity. Mutation of m5C sites at the 5' and 3' ends of PB2 vRNA interfered with the selective packaging of the 8 vRNA segments into virus particles, resulting in the formation of a variety of abnormally packaged virus particles. PB2-vRNA mutants also had reduced replication ability and pathogenicity in mice.

Hepacivirus ratti (Norway rat hepacivirus-1: NRHV1) is a virus closely related to HCV that specifically infects the liver and induces hepatocellular carcinoma in rats, making it a promising surrogate model for HCV. NRHV1 expressing a reporter gene serves as a powerful tool for analyzing the in vivo dynamics and pathogenicity mechanisms of NRHV1. In this study, we developed a reporter NRHV1 capable of infection and replication in both mice and cultured cells and established a platform for generating diverse reporter viruses. A reporter virus containing the HiBiT gene in the coding region of NS5A domain III was constructed using circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER). Infection with this reporter virus led to HiBiT activity in infected cells and the activity was correlated with the amount of intracellular viral RNA. In addition, this reporter virus established persistent infection in NOD-SCID mice and led to the generation of HiBiT activity in the livers of infected mice. Furthermore, reporter virus recovered from infected mice could infect and generate HiBiT activity in cultured cells.

Previously, we developed homeRNA, a kit for immediate stabilization of RNA in self-collected blood using a custom engineered tube containing RNA stabilizer fluid. The stabilized RNA is extracted and used for downstream gene expression analysis. Here, we introduce homeRNAmax, which improves our original design by interfacing with a commercially available blood collection tube (BD Microtainer), allowing homeRNAmax to be used with any blood collection method that uses this tube and doubling the possible sample volume that can be collected and stabilized compared to the original homeRNA. Through a pilot study (n=19 participants), we show that homeRNAmax (with the Tasso+ blood collection device) produces RNA samples of sufficient quality (mean RIN=7.8) and yield (mean yield=1.93 g) for downstream analysis and can reach participants across the United States, who generally (n=17/19) found the homeRNAmax kit easy to use. A key aspect of the homeRNA and homeRNAmax platforms is a fluidic feature that prevents the RNA stabilizer from spilling, however our previous work had not yet fully characterized the mechanism of this feature. Here, we developed a theoretical model of the spill-resistant feature. In brief, fluid in the tube is suspended due to a balance of pressures; an increase in air volume within the tube reduces the air pressure above the fluid, creating a small vacuum, and preventing fluid leakage. Overall, we show that homeRNAmax is a user-friendly, effective tool for remote blood RNA stabilization.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

R.; Jang, H.; Nussinov, R.", "abstract": "Brain metastasis is a major contributor to melanoma-related mortality, arising from both genomic alterations and dynamic adaptations to the brain microenvironment. Tumor cells must cross the blood-brain barrier and exploit brain-specific signaling and metabolic landscapes to establish metastases. Brain metastases display molecular and phenotypic programs distinct from other organs, reflecting pre-existing and acquired mutations during progression. We analyzed primary melanoma, metastatic melanoma, and metastatic brain tumors genomic datasets to identify mutated proteins and signaling pathways that are common to or distinct among these tumor types. Our comprehensive computational analyses uncovered key pathways and proteins associated with brain metastasis. Brain metastases exhibit unique mutational landscapes and convergent alterations in neurotrophin, MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling compared with primary and metastatic melanoma. Proteins especially frequent in brain metastases pathways support survival, proliferation, and adaptation in the brain microenvironment. Pharmacology-wise, rational strategies such as combining c-KIT and VEGFR inhibitors can suppress converging oncogenic pathways and mitigate resistance in advanced melanoma. Co-targeting neurotrophin receptors with MAPK pathway members, particularly in combination with BRAF inhibitors, appears a promising approach for treating melanoma brain metastases. Our findings underscore the molecular heterogeneity of melanoma brain metastases, shaped by interconnected signaling networks, and reveal therapeutic targets that may diverge from those in other metastatic sites.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Consequently, modeling these interactions is critical for understanding biological systems and designing novel RNA-based therapeutics. However, designing RNA sequences that selectively and strongly bind to a specific target remains a major challenge due to the vast sequence space and the current limitations of experimental and computational methods. In this study, we introduce RNA-X, the first RNA interaction foundation model which is based on masked language modeling for representation learning, conditional RNA design, and optimization. For the first time, RNA-X enables (i) RNA design targeting not only proteins but also other RNA and DNA molecules, and (ii) simultaneous design against multiple targets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RNA-X generates RNA sequences with natural structural characteristics and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in protein targeting. Using affinity predictors and molecular dynamics simulations, we further show that the model can design RNA molecules that (i) target therapeutically relevant molecules such as p53 and thrombin proteins, and (ii) bind to targets with no prior interaction data, such as SDAD1 protein. As a proof of concept, we designed a novel guide RNA from scratch that simultaneously binds (i) to the DNA of a bacterium and (ii) to the Cas9 protein. The resulting design achieves a predicted binding energy comparable to that of the wild-type guide RNA reported in the Protein Data Bank. Despite having orders of magnitude fewer parameters than existing RNA foundation models, RNA-X produces representations that outperform them across diverse RNA interaction-related downstream tasks.

While tumor non-autonomous effects on peripheral organs are recognized, how the tumor rewires the circulating immune cells and hematopoiesis remains unclear. We utilized a Drosophila larval cancer cachexia model by expressing yki3SA in the adult midgut precursors (AMP), which gives rise to a tumor in the larval midgut and recapitulates key cachectic phenotypes, including insulin resistance. Tumor-induced cachexia results in perturbed blood cell homeostasis with a reduced niche and aberrant blood cell differentiation in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland (LG). Bulk RNA-seq analysis of circulating hemocytes from tumor-bearing larvae revealed upregulation of multiple cachectic ligands, notably ImpL2, an insulin antagonist. We demonstrate that elevated ImpL2 levels reduce LG niche size and promote aberrant blood cell differentiation. Elevated ImpL2 levels and systemic insulin resistance in the tumor-induced cachexia conditions result in abrogation of insulin signaling in the niche-progenitor micro-environment in the LG. DE-cadherin levels in the primary LG lobe are perturbed, and Wingless signaling is down-regulated, driving prohemocyte differentiation. A genetic mimic of systemic ImpL2 overexpression or high sugar diet (HSD) conditions recapitulates these LG phenotypes due to abrogation of the Insulin-Wingless signaling axis. Hemocyte-specific ImpL2 depletion in HSD-fed larvae rescued these defects, suggesting a regulatory role for circulating hemocyte-derived ImpL2. Our findings reveal that hemocyte-derived factors actively contribute to systemic insulin resistance, causing hematopoietic remodeling in cancer cachexia.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Methods: Cytotoxicity, transcriptomic changes, apoptosis, and protein expression were assessed for BGB-16673 alone and in combination with venetoclax, sonrotoclax, bendamustine, selinexor, lenalidomide, and tazemetostat. Results: BGB-16673 demonstrated single-agent activity in selected MZL cell lines, inducing BTK degradation and transcriptional repression of BCR signaling and MYC targets. Its transcriptional and phenotypic effects overlapped with those of zanubrutinib but also included specific modulation of oxidative phosphorylation genes. Combination studies revealed that BGB-16673 synergized with other targeted agents, achieving the best results with sonrotoclax, venetoclax, bendamustine, lenalidomide, and rituximab. The mechanism of action of the combination with the BCL2 inhibitors was further evaluated. The combination with sonrotoclax consistently enhanced apoptosis across MZL models, outperforming venetoclax in potency in most cell lines. Sonrotoclax showed over 10-fold higher activity than venetoclax in three MZL lines and demonstrated synergistic interaction with BGB-16673. Mechanistically, the combination leads to BTK degradation and modulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as BCL2, MCL1, and BCL-XL. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of BGB-16673 as a therapeutic agent, both as a monotherapy and in combination regimens, for treating MZL patients.

Models trained on HPV-negative HNSCC from TCGA and externally validated on CPTAC robustly predicted transcriptome-derived activities in cancer-relevant signaling pathways. To achieve spatial interpretability, we applied layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to generate heatmaps that highlight positive versus negative evidence for pathway activation. These LRP heatmaps were technically validated by patch-flipping tests and biologically validated against pathway-relevant immunohistochemistry in an independent patient cohort. From these explanations, we derived a tumor area pathway activity score (TAPAS) quantifying the spatial fraction of activated tumor regions within a slide. Applied to a retrospective HNSCC cohort of 1,066 slides from 112 resection specimens, TAPAS captured intratumoral heterogeneity and revealed two biologically dis-tinct tumor states - an oncogenic growth phenotype with widespread pathway activation and a pathway quiescent phenotype associated with higher recurrence risk independent of clinicopathological variables.

However, in response to demyelination, Schwann cells (SCs), the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), can contribute to CNS remyelination. Lineage tracing studies demonstrated that many CNS remyelinating SCs, in addition to remyelinating oligodendrocytes, are derived from adult CNS stem cells called oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Here we describe the mechanisms by which the fate switch of neuroepithelial-derived OPCs into SCs, a cell normally of neural crest origin, occurs. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing we identified a subpopulation of OPCs within demyelinating lesions that co-express SC markers. Within this SC-primed group, differential gene analysis revealed a significant upregulation of genes involved in integrin signalling and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activation. We found that BMP4 and vitronectin, an extracellular matrix molecule and integrin ligand, are sufficient external cues to induce SC differentiation by OPCs by directly exerting effects on the transcription factors OLIG2 and SOX10, which are critical regulators of cell fate in oligodendroglial cells and SCs. We also show that OPCs can be directly programmed toward a SC fate by suppressing the expression levels of Olig2 and while maintaining those of Sox10. OPC-derived SCs morphologically and transcriptionally resemble primary SCs and can myelinate CNS axons with peripheral type myelin. Our findings indicate that injury-related changes in the environment can destabilise oligodendroglial transcription factor networks, enabling alternative OPC fate choices during CNS remyelination.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

How these compounds differ at the level of intracellular signalling, and how hallucinogenic drugs diverge from related non-hallucinogenic forms, is poorly understood. A central question is whether a shared molecular fingerprint distinguishes hallucinogenic psychedelic action from other forms of receptor activation in neurons. Here, we show that chemically diverse psychedelics trigger a coordinated reorganisation of phosphorylation patterns across many proteins in neural cells, and that this global signalling response contains a distinct signature that separates hallucinogenic compounds from non-hallucinogenic counterparts of similar structure. We use a glycolysis-regulating transcription factor as an example of the signature functional relevance to show that hallucinogenic psychedelics, but not their non-hallucinogenic analogues, enhance markers of glycolytic metabolism. These findings reveal that hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic psychedelics engage separable intracellular architectures, and establish a framework for understanding how different psychoactive compounds couple receptor activation to specific cellular states.

Whole-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were collected and used to fit the feedback model and estimate feedback delay and gains. Results showed good model fits for both walking and standing with mean R2-values higher than 0.69. The feedback delay was significantly longer in walking than in standing. While the feedback position gains and velocity gains varied significantly across tasks and directions, position gains were mostly above critical stiffness and velocity gains all at under-damped level, with as only exception that position gains in the AP direction in walking, which were slightly below critical stiffness. The ratio of position to velocity gains in all tasks remained consistently close to the eigenfrequency (sqrt(g/l)) as predicted by the extrapolated center of mass concept.

Despite its prominent role in these tissues, the function of Nlrp1 in melanoma remains poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the impact of Nlrp1 on melanoma patient survival and found that its expression is associated with improved prognosis and with a co-expression network enriched for pro-inflammatory genes. However, in murine models, neither Nlrp1 expression nor activation significantly affected melanoma development or progression. Similarly, pharmacological activation of Nlrp1 using Val-Boro-Pro (VbP) did not alter tumor growth or the local inflammatory profile in mice but directly influenced CD25+ cell generation and glucose uptake in in vitro models. Finally, we demonstrated that a melanoma risk score can be constructed based on genes specific to inflammasome and pyroptosis pathways.

However, widely used methods introduce biases that complicate data interpretation and limit cross-study comparability. For instance, multiple-displacement amplification (MDA) preferentially amplifies single-stranded DNA viruses, while total metagenomes are dominated by non-viral sequences, reducing viral signal. These traditional methods have not been systematically compared to viral size-fraction metagenomes (viromes) prepared without MDA. To address this, we applied four common methods for characterising human gut viral community composition (total metagenomes, viromes with/ without DNase treatment (to remove free DNA), and MDA viromes) to a human stool sample, with technical triplicates for each approach. MDA biased viral community composition to a shocking degree: Microviridae formed ~90% of MDA viromes compared to just 2% of non-MDA viromes. Removing ssDNA viruses from data analyses substantially reduced, but did not eliminate, MDA bias. Metagenomes were enriched for putative temperate phages and predicted Bacillota-phages, whereas predicted Bacteroidetes-phages dominated all viromes, suggesting that metagenomes and viromes select for different populations within the total viral community. DNase treatment had little-to-no effect on virome richness or community composition. This proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates that preparatory methods for viral community analysis can lead to substantially different conclusions from the same faecal sample, and we provide a comprehensive omic data analysis framework for comparing laboratory methodologies for viral ecology.

Biochemical studies of the purified protein revealed that the TCV P38 VSR functions as a metastable dimer that binds double-stranded (ds) RNA with high affinity via an induced-fit mechanism of both binding partners. Consistent with its role as a VSR that interferes with antiviral RNAi at various stages, P38 distinguishes between siRNAs of different lengths. Consistent with its capsid-forming function, the protein binds longer dsRNAs cooperatively. Structural data obtained from an RNA-free capsid-like icosahedral crystal and modeling of Tombusviridae capsid proteins suggest that flexible interactions between the P (protruding)-domains of P38 are important determinants for forming both the VSR dimer and the capsid structure.

GC7 (N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane), an inhibitor of eIF5A hypusination, improves the resistance of various cells to ischemia/reperfusion. Our study therefore explored whether ex-situ conditioning of pancreatic islets with GC7 during the preparation process could serve as a strategy to enhance the outcomes of pancreatic islet transplantation. Conditioning of mouse primary islets with GC7 at the digestion step of the pancreas significantly improved the procedure yield. Indeed, islets showed better survival at 24h and 72h after isolation and major protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Finally, the transplantation of a suboptimal number of islets under the renal capsule of hyperglycemic mice demonstrated superior functionality and survival of islets conditioned with GC7 compared to control islets.

Sequence graphs are a highly effective tool for genome comparisons because they enable high-resolution de novo analyses that capture and contextualize complex genomic variation. However, applying sequence graphs to complex microbial communities remains challenging due to the scale and complexity of metagenomic data. Existing multi-sample sequence graphs used in these settings are highly complex, computationally expensive, less accurate than single-sample alternatives, and often involve arbitrary coarse-graining. Here, we present copangraph, a multi-sample sequence-graph-based analysis framework for comprehensive comparisons of genomic variation across metagenomes. Copangraph uses a novel homology-based graph, which provides both non-arbitrary, evolutionary-motivated grouping of sequences into the same node as well as flexibility in the scale of variation represented by the graph. Its construction relies on hybrid coassembly, a new coassembly approach in which single-sample graphs are first constructed separately and are then merged to create a multi-sample graph. We also present an algorithm that uses paired-end reads to improve detection of contiguous genomic regions, increasing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that copangraph captures sequence and variant information more accurately than alternative methods, provides graphs that are more suitable for comparative analysis than de Bruijn graphs, and is computationally tractable. We show that copangraph reflects meaningful metagenomic variation across diverse scenarios. Importantly, it enables significantly better performance than other metagenomic representations when predicting the gut colonization trajectories of Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Our results underscore the value of our multi-sample, graph-based framework for comparative metagenomic analyses.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Recent advances have yielded significant progress in computational toxicity prediction, including machine learning methods that utilize chemical fingerprints and deep learning-based latent representations. However, challenges remain, primarily due to the lack of clean training datasets and the inconsistent model performance. To address these challenges, we curated a comprehensive dataset of aquatic toxicity from seven data sources, which contains 50,603 records for 5,889 compounds across 2,285 different species, much larger than similar datasets used in previous studies. We also developed tox-learn, a Python library featuring tools for automated dataset cleaning, machine learning methods and performance evaluation. The library places special emphasis on avoiding overestimation of prediction accuracy caused by improper train-test data splitting. Based on this toolbox, we benchmarked various predictive models using different train-test splitting strategies on the curated dataset. Our results showed that the choice of machine learning method, molecular fingerprint, and train-test splitting strategy all significantly affect performance. We demonstrated that incorporating species information generally improved predictions, although the degree of improvement depended on how this information was represented. In addition, we developed a new 3D structure-based deep-learning model, 3DMol-Tox, which achieves regression accuracy comparable to the best 2D-structure based model (GPBoost) while exhibiting consistently higher within-one-bin (W1B) classification accuracy. Finally, we analyzed the impact of different train-test splitting strategies and provide recommendations based on our benchmarking, such as using structure-aware splitting to mitigate information leakage, a common issue that inflates reported model performance.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The vestibular organs of birds are capable of regenerating sensory hair cells after ototoxic injury, but the regenerative ability of the mammalian vestibular organs is much more limited. The factors that inhibit regeneration in the mammalian inner ear are not known, but it has been proposed that the structure of filamentous actin cables at cell-cell junctions within the sensory epithelium may be an important regulatory influence. Junctional actin cables in the chick utricle are relatively thin, while those in mouse utricle are much thicker. These differences result in differing mechanical properties of the avian vs. mammalian inner ear, which may affect the potential for regenerative proliferation. The present study characterized injury-evoked changes in junctional actin cables in the utricles of mice and chicks. We found that the thickness of junctional cables in the chick utricle was not affected by ototoxic injury, but that injury to the mouse utricle led to the formation of many new junctional actin bands whose thickness was comparable to those in the chick utricle. Thicker actin bands persisted after injury, but were not necessarily associated with cellular junctions. In addition, the relative extent of supporting cell expansion in the injured chick utricle was larger than that in the mouse utricle, which may affect activation of Hippo/YAP signaling in both species. Together, these data point to important differences in actin cable plasticity in the avian vs. mammalian utricle that may partially account for their differing regenerative abilities.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Here we reveal that AKT1 kinase promotes autophagy through a non-canonical pathway. AKT2 loss triggers compensatory AKT1 activation, which phosphorylates telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) at Serine 824, driving nuclear translocation. Nuclear TERT assembles with FOXO3 and c-MYC into a transcriptional complex that activates PERK, initiating a feed-forward loop. PERK-ATF4 signaling amplifies autophagy gene transcription while inducing selective ERphagy through receptors TEX264 and CCPG1. Using C. elegans, mouse models, and human iPSCs, we demonstrate this AKT1-TERT-c-MYC-FOXO3 axis is evolutionarily conserved and essential for proteostasis in post-mitotic cells. We developed a first-in-class allosteric AKT2 inhibitor through structure-guided design that selectively triggers beneficial AKT1 compensation, restoring autophagy in diseased cells. These findings reveal a transcriptional mechanism linking AKT1 activation to autophagy and provide a therapeutic strategy for diseases with defective ER quality control.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Concerned that previous studies improperly used spike-in normalization to arrive at their conclusions, we used ChIP-wrangler to show that acute depletion of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) has only a modest impact on the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. In line with other studies, our results provide proof that the maintenance of histone acetylation is not merely a consequence of ongoing transcription. Further, we show that promoters and enhancers are differentially impacted by inhibiting transcription. Specifically, of the 5.9% peaks that showed a decrease in H3K27ac following depletion of RNAPII, 82% are promoter-distal and contain enhancer-related DNA binding motifs. Further, the small subset of regions that gain acetylation (0.35%) were enriched for stress response motifs.

The development and deployment of mRNA vaccines during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic was a landmark achievement in modern medicine and ushered in a new age of vaccine innovation. The mRNA-based vaccines elicited strong antibody responses, both neutralizing and extra-neutralizing, against the viral Spike protein. The antibody levels waned with time since vaccination, and that coupled with the antigenic drift of the virus prompted updates to the mRNA vaccine composition and evaluation of other mRNA modalities. Self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) vaccines such as ARCT-154 can prolong antigen production and durability of humoral immune response post-immunization, and can thus be administered at a lower dose. How this translates into the overall humoral architecture compared to that shaped by conventional mRNA vaccinations, however, is unclear. Here, we analyze serum-based antibody responses from a recent Phase III trial comparing humoral responses elicited by ARCT-154 and mRNA BNT162B2. All participants had received three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and were randomized to receive a booster dose of ARCT-154 or BNT162B2. Primary outcomes were to quantify waning responses against ancestral/wild type SARS-CoV-2 Spike (WT Spike) and a panel of antigenically SARS-CoV-2 variants Spikes. Through a systems serology approach, we identified that the sa-mRNA vaccine ARCT-154 elicited a unique antibody response compared to BNT162B2 defined by a sustained, activating profile to the vaccine-encoded Spike protein and a broad spectrum of drifted Spikes. Notably, potently activating Fc{gamma}RIIIA-binding antibodies showed a sustained stimulation in the ARCT-154-treatment arm, and this translated to an enhanced natural killer (NK) cell activation. The NK-activation through ARCT-154 was present for both target WT Spike and the antigenically drifted BA.5 Spike, which was the predominant form of SARS-CoV-2 during the observation period.

The bioactive metabolites, metabolic pathways, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms underlying their effects remain poorly defined. We identified hippuric acid (HIPA) as a biomarker of polyphenol-microbiome interaction. HIPA is a meta-organismal metabolite produced through a cross-organ pathway that involves synthesis from gut microbial polyphenol metabolism via 3-phenylpropionic acid (3PPA), followed by renal clearance. We found that CD is characterised by impaired polyphenol metabolism, resulting in deficient colonic 3-PPA and reduced serum hippuric acid relative to healthy individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 3-PPA is a colon-enriched, mild PPAR-r agonist that ameliorates colitis in murine model. Systemic bioinformatic profiling of metagenomic data suggested the existence of undiscovered 3-PPA producers.

In this study, we engineer a set of cumate inducible vectors for use in Burkholderia cenocepacia that offer minimal basal expression and the ability to control B cenocepacia gene expression within Eukaryotic cells. Through mutagenesis-based studies of cumate circuits and the cumate regulator (CymR), we generate an optimized cumate circuit (PCymRC/CymRGV) which allows the tight and tunable control of protein expression within B cenocepacia, as assessed by fluorescent and protein O-linked glycosylation analysis. Using comparative proteomics, we demonstrate cumate induction leads to both reduced and orthogonal effects on B. cenocepacia compared to widely used rhamnose based induction systems. Leveraging the cell permeability of cumate and the generation of a CTX-based chromosomal integration vector, we show that inducible control of protein expression is achievable during intracellular replication of B. cenocepacia. Finally, using the ability to control intracellular expression, we demonstrate the requirement of O-linked protein glycosylation for optimal B. cenocepacia intracellular replication.

Studying phage-host interaction and population dynamics in biofilms with cellular resolution remains a significant challenge, especially when attempting to recapitulate key features of the natural environments that bacteria and phages occupy. Here we study the population dynamics of phage K139 lysogenized and non-lysogenized Vibrio cholerae when growing in biofilms on the surface of chitin particles under flow of sea water, replicating key features of V. cholerae ecology in the marine environment. We find that lysogenized V. cholerae, via spontaneous lytic induction and phage release, initially kill and displace non-lysogenized bacteria on chitin surfaces. After lysogens become common, however, they no longer tend to displace non-lysogenized cells. Using a combination of modeling approaches and phage K139 derivatives with variable infectivity, we show that the ability of lysogens to displace non-lysogens depends on the ability of phages released by spontaneous induction to reach susceptible non-lysogens. We find that phage access to non-lysogenized bacterial hosts declines once lysogens become common, and this occurs due to the spatial constraints inherent to biofilm growth, as well as to superinfection exclusion, which neutralizes phage particles adsorbed to lysogens surface. Thus, once lysogens comprise the majority of the host population, they can be selected against because they incur the cost of spontaneous induction without gaining the benefit of killing non-lysogen cells via phage release. The balance of cost of lytic induction, phage-mediated killing of non-lysogens, and constraints on phage mobility within host bacterial biofilms therefore impose negative frequency dependent selection for lysogenized cells under physiologically realistic growth conditions.\n\nSignificance StatementBacteria often produce and live within biofilm communities in natural environments, where they also encounter many threats including bacteriophages. Here we show how temperate phages can alter the fitness of their host via lytic induction and phage release within biofilms of V. cholerae on lab-grown marine snow particles.

Ecological theory makes predictions about how productivity and diversity shape communities, and experiments in the built environment provide an opportunity to test these. We manipulated moisture (constant or repeated wet-dry cycling) on three common building materials to test predictions about alpha and beta diversity. The most productive material (oriented strand board) supported the highest bacterial alpha and beta diversity, and these diversity levels were reduced by repeated drying disturbances. Diversity patterns for fungi were more variable, with the highest alpha diversity on low-moderate productivity material (gypsum wallboard). Fungal beta diversity was reduced by disturbance on high-productivity material but increased on the other materials. These patterns were driven largely by members of Bacillaceae, Sphingomonadaceae, and Aspergillaceae that reached high abundances in some treatments. Differences between bacteria and fungi may be due to the scale-dependence of productivity-diversity relationships.

In the aerobic saprophyte Mycobacterium smegmatis, hydrogen oxidation is catalyzed by two differentially expressed, high-affinity, oxygen-insensitive uptake hydrogenases, Huc and Hhy. Huc enables mixotrophic growth and facilitates the transition from growth to dormancy. Although the huc operon is known to be upregulated in response to organic carbon deprivation, the specific signals and regulators modulating its expression remain unresolved. Here, we show that GylR, a glycerol-3-phosphate-sensing regulator of glycerol metabolism, plays a role in repression of huc expression in response to the availability of glycerol but not other carbon sources. Based on proteomic analyses and activity assays, mutation or knockdown of gylR leads to enhanced Huc production and activity. GylR and other key catabolite repressor proteins (Crp1, Crp2) do not directly bind the huc operon, indicating repression is mediated by unidentified transcription factors, with GylR acting as an upstream sensor. Here, we present data that suggests atmospheric H2 oxidation is regulated in response to organic carbon source availability through the process of catabolite repression. By identifying a key signal that prompts atmospheric H2 oxidation, these findings advance understanding of how aerobic bacteria adapt to changing environmental conditions and suggest that organic carbon levels are a key factor regulating the main sink of atmospheric H2 in soils globally.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

One CAUTI-associated pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, is commonly found persisting asymptomatically in the bladder of catheterized individuals, increasing these individuals risk of developing CAUTI. Importantly, S. aureus is not only associated with severe symptoms, including bacteremia and septic shock, but it also produces a common uropathogen associated virulence factor, urease. Despite its importance, urease has only been well-studied in the uropathogen Proteus mirabilis. While previous studies identified three S. aureus urease regulators, CodY, CcpA, and Agr, the environmental signals required for expression and activity, and the contribution of urease to CAUTI have not been explored. In this study, we investigate how the urease regulatory pathways coordinate expression and activity in response to environmental signals present within the catheterized urinary tract. Our findings demonstrate that stationary phase significantly induces S. aureus urease expression and activity. Additionally, we identified predicted binding sites in the urease promoter for three regulators previously implicated in urease expression - CodY, CcpA, and SigB - as well as SrrA - a previously unrecognized regulator of urease. A binding site for Agr was not present in the urease promoter. Expression and activity assays confirm the role of CodY, CcpA, SigB, SrrA, and Agr in regulating urease. Importantly, single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in the urease promoter of clinical isolates enhance urease expression. Additionally, urease promotes biofilm formation under catheterized urinary tract-like conditions in vitro and dissemination from the bladder to the kidneys at 1 day post infection in a mouse CAUTI model.

Our structural analyses reveal that McsAZ2-McsB forms a rod-shaped heterotetramer, with two of these heterotetramers assembling into an asymmetrically crossing shape through phosphorylated arginine residues (pArg194 and pArg333) of McsB. The CtsR dimer binds to the groove of the McsAZ2-McsB oligomer via pArg115 of McsA and pArg194 of McsB. Anisotropy experiments indicate that CtsR dissociates slowly from its operator during heat shock, and McsAB facilitates this process in an ATP-dependent manner.

In this work, we introduce an open-source tool designed for rigorous host-read removal and apply it to the reanalysis of WGS data from ten mucinous rectal adenocarcinoma cases originally published by Reynolds et al. The workflow integrates k-mer-based classification (Kraken2), quality and adapter trimming (Trim Galore), vector filtering (BBDuk/UniVec_Core), and duplicate-removal (FastUniq). After reducing data complexity, a multi-aligner, multi-reference approach (BWA-MEM/GRCh38, Bowtie2/T2T-CHM13, Minimap2/HPRC v1.1) removes remaining host sequences, collectively eliminating more than 99.9% of human-derived reads.

Taxonomic profiling with PathSeq and MetaPhlAn revealed reproducible enrichment of Fusobacterium species in tumour versus matched normal tissues, with stricter filtering reducing overall microbial signal compared to prior results. Cross-validation with immunofluorescence analysis using pan-Fusobacterium (detecting both F. animalis and F. nucleatum) and F. nucleatum-specific antibodies showed a strong concordance with Fusobacterium subspecies detected by WGS.

A potentially large contributor to binding thermodynamics is the difference in conformational entropy of the protein upon binding a ligand; however, this information has been difficult to quantify, especially in high-throughput. Here, through multiconformer ensemble modeling of hundreds of ligand-bound SARS-CoV-2 Macrodomain (Mac1) X-ray structures, we show how ligand binding reorganizes both protein conformational entropy and water molecules. By applying an optimal transport-based clustering algorithm, we show how specific protein-ligand interactions patterns drive the magnitude and spatial redistribution of conformational entropy and solvent networks. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we demonstrate a correlation between experimental binding thermodynamics and conformational entropy estimated from structural ensemble models, showing that increased conformational heterogeneity and a less connected hydrogen-bonded water network lead to more entropic binding. These results establish a framework for extracting thermodynamically meaningful information from crystallographic ensembles, enabling the integration of entropic effects into prospective, ensemble-aware drug discovery.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

However, evaluating numerous FLS2 variants directly in plants is slow and low throughput, and have been seldom optimized for heterologous display systems. Here, we established conditions that enabled Arabidopsis thaliana FLS2 ectodomain functional expression on the surface of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and binding to its cognate ligand, flg22. We show how yeast high-mannose glycosylation of the FLS2 ectodomain contributes to inefficient folding and loss of detectable flg22 binding in standard yeast surface display conditions. Substitutions at all N-glycosylation motifs compromised surface expression, indicating that some glycosylation is required for trafficking. We tuned the extent of glycosylation using tunicamycin, an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor, in combination with thermal stress to modulate ER quality control. Under these conditions, we observed a reproducible subpopulation of cells with improved flg22 binding despite reduced overall expression, and we confirmed flg22 selectivity using both flow cytometry and magnetic bead-based enrichment. Guided by structural modeling of high-mannose glycans on the FLS2 ectodomain, we then substituted asparagines at selected N-glycan sites. We identified a key glycan site variant, N388, which lies proximal to the flg22 binding interface and enhanced functional expression under stress conditions. Together, these results reveal that lineage-specific glycosylation patterns and ER stress responses critically shape the functional display of FLS2 in yeast. This approach provides a framework for engineering yeast surface display platforms for high-throughput screening of FLS2 and related immune receptors.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

To investigate how chromatin context influences inducibility in differentiated cells, we employed engineered synthetic reader-actuators (SRAs), fusion proteins containing the polycomb chromodomain (PCD) that binds H3K27me3. In MCF7 breast cancer cells, we mapped PCD-fusion occupancy by ChIP-seq and used RNA-seq to identify temporally resolved gene activation patterns. ChIP-seq profiling and machine learning models (MLM) demonstrated that PCD-fusion binding was predicted by the presence of H3K27me3, H4K20me1, or H3K36me3 enrichment, suggesting selective accessibility at enhancers and chromatin transition zones. Among genes with PCD-fusion enriched enhancers, the SRA-induced subset was distinguished by promoter features including bivalent histone modifications and enrichment of transcriptional repressors REST and MTA1. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SRA responsiveness depends on a specific chromatin signature beyond H3K27me3 alone. This study demonstrates the power of SRAs to dissect inducible chromatin features in their native genomic context, and suggests that epigenetically repressed regions in differentiated cells can retain regulatory plasticity.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

This data-driven \"digital twin\" reproduced the cortical population dynamics underlying motor planning and inhibition, revealing how internal network states shape behavior, and generating synthetic neural trajectories for unseen conditions.

Wet sanitation is sometimes employed to mitigate cross-contamination in LMF facilities, but the introduction of moisture to otherwise dry environments can inadvertently promote pathogen growth. This study evaluated the risks associated with wet sanitation in LMF facilities by characterizing evaporation kinetics on powdered infant formula (PIF)--soiled surfaces, monitoring relative humidity (RH) in a LMF facility during and after wet sanitation, and assessing growth of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Cronobacter sakazakii, and Enterococcus faecium spot inoculated on PIF-soiled stainless steel coupons under dynamic RH conditions. As expected, higher RH slowed drying of PIF-soiled surfaces, prolonging periods when the soil's water activity (a w) was high enough to support microbial growth. Correspondingly, all four organisms grew significantly at 81 and 97% RH over 120 h (p<0.05), while only E. faecium grew significantly below 81% RH (p<0.05). Monitoring of RH during and after wet sanitation in a commercial facility revealed spikes up to 100% RH during sanitation and sustained RH above 75% for more than 7 h in poorly ventilated areas. When those facility RH conditions were simulated in the laboratory, Salmonella populations on PIF-soiled coupons increased by more than 3.5 Log CFU/coupon within 66 h.

To address this gap, we generate high resolution optical density time series data for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3 antibiotics, 12 doses, 7 inoculum sizes, 4x replication), enabling gradient estimation and gradient-based model parameterization. We develop a dynamics-led computational pipeline that (1) evaluates population scale ordinary differential equation models from estimated time derivative data, and (2) classifies transient dynamics in dose-inoculum space using unsupervised clustering. Applied to our data, the pipeline identifies an ordinary differential equation model with a saturating antibiotic-loss term and a threshold-dependent weak Allee term that recapitulates and quantifies classic rate, yield, and inoculum effects of antibiotics. In addition, our model and clustering approach suggest a set of novel metrics, defining thresholds separating distinct dynamical regimes.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, can increase azole susceptibility of C. albicans biofilms significantly. However, the underlining mechanism is not known. We investigated the effect of arachidonic acid on known fluconazole resistance mechanisms namely, overexpression of ERG11, increased ergosterol content, oxidative stress resistance, as well as expression and activity of the efflux pump, Cdr1p. Upregulation of ERG11 was observed in biofilms exposed to fluconazole. However, this was reversed in the presence of arachidonic acid, even in the presence of fluconazole. Furthermore, arachidonic acid downregulated the fluconazole-induced oxidative stress response of C. albicans. Previous transcriptome data indicated a significant increase in CDR1 expression during early biofilm formation in the presence of arachidonic acid. However, we found that efflux activity was reduced in the presence of arachidonic acid, which indicates the loss of function of the membrane-associated protein. This contradictory phenomenon was further investigated by determining the effect of arachidonic acid on the localisation and phosphorylation of Cdr1p (ProteomeXchange identifier PXD070958). Our results show that the presence of arachidonic acid may cause mislocalisation and changes in the phosphorylation of Cdr1p; all of which could impact its activity.

To support rigorous evaluation of these effects in further clinical trials, reliable and validated methods for quantifying B. infantis in stool are needed. Methods: We validated a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay against a conserved B. infantis genomic target. Assay performance was evaluated using DNA from the B. infantis strain Bi-26, spiked infant stool pools, and matrix controls. Validation parameters included linearity, sensitivity, accuracy, within- and between-run reproducibility, recovery, and matrix interference, with acceptance criteria informed by bioanalytical best practices. Results: The assay demonstrated robust performance across validation parameters. Linearity was confirmed over at least six orders of magnitude (R2 > 0.99; mean efficiency 96.4%), with a lower limit of quantification of 37.36 genome equivalents / reaction. Analytical sensitivity was high, with a 95% limit of detection of 4.67 genome equivalents / reaction.

The peroxiredoxin Tsa1, the main cytosolic 2-Cys peroxiredoxin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is well-known for its antioxidant role, but there is an increased interest in understanding its contribution to metabolic regulation. Here we show that Tsa1 exerts a broad regulatory influence on central carbon metabolism, through modulation of the Ras/cAMP/PKA nutrient-signalling pathway. Using dynamic flux balance analysis, we demonstrate that deletion of TSA1 leads to a marked reduction in gluconeogenic flux during the post-diauxic phase, resulting in diminished trehalose and glycogen accumulation. The tsa1{Delta} mutant displays persistent PKA activation under glucose-depleted conditions, evidenced by sustained phosphorylation of the trehalase Nth1 and impaired nuclear localization of the stress-responsive transcription factor Msn2. Consequently, genes under Msn2/4 control, including those involved in trehalose synthesis, are repressed. Despite normal abundance and activity of the trehalose synthase complex, increased Nth1 protein levels and activity indicate enhanced PKA-dependent trehalose degradation in the absence of Tsa1. Moreover, tsa1{Delta} cells exhibit altered cell size homeostasis and defective cell cycle re-entry following glucose replenishment, linking Tsa1-mediated metabolic regulation to proliferative control.

Without Tat, a nucleosome occupies the core promoter and prevents assembly of the pre-initiation complex. With Tat, this nucleosome is absent while TBP and initiating polymerases are frequently detected. Combining live imaging with SMF provides a mechanistic model of promoter dynamics, which estimates the rates of deposition and removal of promoter nucleosomes (0.7 h-1), TBP binding (0.04 min-1) and polymerase loading (seconds).

Here, we find that elevating intracellular cAMP with forskolin and IBMX induces rapid nuclear import of TFEB-GFP within 30 minutes and coincides with a transient upregulation of TFEB target lysosome genes. By 8 hours, TFEB returns to the cytoplasm, accompanied by transcriptional downregulation. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) using H89 did not block nuclear import but unexpectedly caused sustained nuclear accumulation, indicating that PKA promotes TFEB nuclear export.

Here we present a 3.3 [A] cryo-EM structure of wild type 5-lipoxygenase in complex with ATP, one of its most important allosteric regulators. The nucleotide is located in a positively charged pocket of the catalytic domain and held in place by a complex network of amino acid side chains and backbone carbonyl and amino groups. Mutagenetic analysis suggests that ATP binding and action is primarily mediated via Lys320, assisted by Gln657. Further atomistic simulations demonstrate that ATP binding induces movements of the PLAT domain coupled to conformational rearrangements at the active center. These findings provide important structural and regulatory insights to a key enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis, thus aiding in design of new antiphlogistic drugs.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

TDP-43 binds to GU dinucleotide repeats, which are highly abundant sequences in human RNA. Here we show TDP-43 has one of the highest affinities and specificities measured for an RNA binding protein. Binding prevents formation of the pUG fold, an intramolecular quadruplex, and conversely pUG fold formation prevents TDP-43 binding. A rapid on-rate allows TDP-43 to capture single stranded RNA prior to folding. The protein recognizes the RNA as a 1D lattice, in which overlapping binding sites produce efficient initial binding events that interfere with subsequent interactions. This effect is partially overcome by RNA facilitated protein-protein interactions, which serve to increase the on-rate of a second TDP-43 molecule. In conjunction with all atom models, these data reveal how TDP-43 recognizes RNA repeat sequences and identify an interplay between RNA folding and protein recognition that may be relevant to human disease.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

While prior studies examined longer helices for deep septal pacing, the influence of other design variables remains unclear. Objective: To evaluate how helix design and axial force affect interventricular septum insertion efficacy. Methods: Rigid leads were developed using helical coils with variable outer diameter, number of turns and pitch. Porcine septa (n=16) were clamped perpendicularly for insertion using an optimized rotation-response system. Axial force simulating lumenless (30g) or stylet-driven (60g) leads was applied, and a fixed number of rotations were delivered at a constant rate. Each helix design (n=8) was tested 3x per axial force at three septal sites. Insertion depth, muscle-torque and visual feedback were recorded. Insertion was successful if depth exceeded coil length without surface entanglement. Effects of design factors were compared. Results: At 30g, more helix turns significantly improved insertion success (P=0.04), while fewer turns frequently produced entangled failure (P=0.04) marked by high torque variability (P<0.001). Smaller-pitch helices trended toward higher torque and success, whereas larger pitch achieved greater depth (P=0.05). Larger outer diameters also trended toward higher torque and improved success at 30g. At 60g the influence of helix design variable diminished and consistently yielded higher than at 30g. Conclusion: An optimized lead rotation-to-translation system elucidates how helix geometry and axial force interact during septal insertion. These interactions are explainable using an intuitive mechanical framework which is helpful for optimizing lead design.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Although powerful, it is iterative and time-consuming and can result in trade-offs, where affinity is gained at the cost of other essential properties, such as specificity and stability. Here, we present a scalable structure- and energy-based strategy, called LAffAb, that starts from a crystallographic structure of the bound antibody-antigen complex and introduces combinations of mutations to optimize the energy. A combinatorial mutation library comprising 7,000 variants with up to nine mutations results in large gains of up to 1,000-fold in affinity while co-optimizing antibody stability. Surprisingly, the library does not converge on a single solution; instead, it favors diverse variants with a high mutational load. Applied in small scale (10 designs) to an antibody targeting a potential drug target, designs improved affinity by an order of magnitude with little loss in specificity or stability. We envision that LAffAb can be used to select stable, specific, and high-affinity binders and to improve our understanding of sequence, structure, and function relationships in antibodies.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Plant-microbe interactions are, however, dynamic and the timing of the stress will affect both partners, directly and indirectly. Here, we hypothesize that the effect of drought stress on the wheat rhizosphere microbiome would change between key growth stages. We grew wheat in pots and stopped watering them for two weeks at stem elongation, booting, or heading. We then sampled the rhizosphere soil and sequenced its metatranscriptome. The timing of the drought strongly affected the transcriptional response of the microbes, but few differentially abundant transcripts were shared across all stages. Some common patterns were however observed at higher taxonomical or functional levels. Drought also affected the normal succession across wheat growth stages. Many of the differentially abundant transcripts, taxa and functions between growth stages of the control plants were not significant anymore for plants that experienced drought. Our results suggest that the timing of the drought event is paramount to the microbial rhizosphere communities, and that it could explain the heightened sensitivity of younger plants to stresses.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

F.; Lee, S.", "abstract": "Higher-level action interpretation, such as inferring underlying intentions and predicting future actions, requires the integration of conceptual action information (e.g. \"opening\") with semantic knowledge about persons and objects (e.g. \"my friend Anna\", \"pizza box\"). However, how the neural systems for action and object recognition and memory interact with each other to form the basis for inferring higher-level mental states remains unclear. Here we use fMRI-based crossmodal multiple regression representational similarity analysis in human female and male participants to elucidate the processing stages from basic action and object recognition to mentalizing. We show that inferring intentions from observed actions or written sentences involves a modality-general network of lateral and medial frontoparietal and temporal brain regions associated with conceptual action and object representation and mentalizing. The representational profiles in these regions are explained by models capturing different types of conceptual information, revealing distinct but partially overlapping networks for action, object, and mental state representation. There was no strict separation of networks for action, object, and mental state representations, arguing against a sequential bottom-up hierarchy from action and object understanding pathways to the mentalizing network. Rather, left-hemispheric regions, specifically ventrolateral prefrontal, inferior parietal and anterior lateral occipitotemporal cortex, showed strong representational overlap, pointing towards a core network for making meaning of action-object structures at a conceptual level. We argue that this core network represents a distributional semantic hub between classic networks for action and object understanding and the mentalizing network.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Recent studies in the frontal cortex have revealed that multiple elements of a sequence are represented simultaneously in separable neural subspaces, challenging classical serial models of sequential planning. Here, we show that these representations emerge naturally under inferential planning in which sequential actions are inferred from sensory evidence and goals. Using a hierarchical generative model, we reproduce key neural phenomena observed in primate frontal cortex, including the simultaneous activation of multiple plan elements, the emergence of (almost) orthogonal `memory' subspaces, and their reuse across forward and backward sequence tasks. Our approach provides a mechanistic account of how probabilistic inference over control states gives rise to distributed and dynamic neural representations of plans. This framework not only unifies previously disparate findings on planning, working memory, and motor preparation, but also generates novel, testable predictions about the dynamics of active inference, the role of sensory subspaces, and the impact of uncertainty on sequence processing.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

P.; Ryali, S.; Qin, S.; Menon, V.", "abstract": "Episodic memory, the ability to rapidly learn and explicitly remember past events and experiences, plays a critical role in childrens academic learning and knowledge acquisition. The formation of lasting memories relies on the brain's ability to dynamically organize its activity. How these neural configurations unfold moment-by-moment across encoding and offline phases remains poorly understood. To probe these dynamics, we applied a novel Bayesian Switching Dynamic Systems approach, a hidden Markov model with automatic state detection, to fMRI data from children performing scene encoding followed by an offline post-encoding rest. We identified four distinct brain states during encoding with unique activation modes between visual, medial temporal lobe, and frontoparietal and default mode network nodes. An \"active-encoding\" state with integrated visual-hippocampal and frontoparietal activity dominated encoding and predicted individual memory performance, while an inactive state negatively predicted performance. State transition dynamics revealed that flexible shifts into the active-encoding state enhanced memory formation, whereas transitions toward inactive states impaired it, demonstrating that memory success depends on dynamic neural flexibility. Critically, encoding states spontaneously reemerged during post-encoding rest. A \"default-mode\" state characterized by enhanced default mode network activity showed sustained maintenance during rest and robustly predicted memory outcomes, an effect specific to post-encoding, not pre-encoding rest. These findings establish that episodic memory emerges from coordinated brain state sequences bridging online encoding with offline consolidation, providing a computational framework for how moment-to-moment neural dynamics support memory formation in children.

Previously, we demonstrated that diazepam reduces anxiety-like behavior by inhibiting the dentate gyrus and CA3 principal neurons via 2-GABAARs, while inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons is necessary to suppress fear-related responses. This study investigated the role of inputs from ventral CA3 (vCA3) and entorhinal cortex to ventral CA1 (vCA1) in anxiety- and fear-like behavior using bidirectional optogenetic modulations. Adult C57BL/6J male and female mice were subjected to bilateral stereotaxic injection of a viral vector expressing channelrhodopsin or halorhodopsin into vCA3 or into layers II-III of lateral entorhinal cortex, followed by bilateral implantation of fiberoptic ferrules into vCA1. After four weeks of recovery, mice were assessed for anxiety-like behavior in the novel open field, elevated plus maze, and Vogel conflict tests, and by contextual and trace fear conditioning for fear. The behavior of the mice was recorded under laser  ON and  OFF conditions in all experiments. The activation of vCA3 to vCA1 projections (i.e., Schaffer collateral pathway) increased anxiety- and fear-related behaviors, whereas inhibition reduced such behaviors. In contrast, optogenetic activation or inhibition of EC to vCA1 projections (i.e., temporoammonic pathway) had no effect on anxiety-related behavior but positively or negatively modulated fear-related behavior, respectively. These results suggest that while fear-related behavior is modulated by both inputs to vCA1, modulation of anxiety-related behavior is input-specific for the vCA3 to vCA1 projection. In summary, this study offers mechanistic insights into the complex organization of hippocampal circuitry underlying fear and anxiety.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

Although task-specific representations of WM have been observed in a distributed network encompassing sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices, whether these regions construct task-generalizable representations and whether such representations can be dynamically shaped by task demands remain unclear. Across two functional MRI experiments, we investigated WM generalization across distinct WM tasks (location and object tasks) based on shared underlying task structures. Trial-specific task demands varied between passive maintenance and active, rule-guided manipulation of mnemonic stimuli. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) demonstrated task-generalizable stimulus representations during both maintenance and manipulation. In contrast, the lateral (LFC) and medial (MFC) frontal cortices supported manipulation- and maintenance-based generalization, respectively. Critically, manipulation-based generalization in the PPC and LFC emerged even when participants did not explicitly learn the mapping between task spaces, indicating that active exploration of task structure can spontaneously facilitate generalization across tasks. Together, these findings reveal that flexible generalization for goal-directed behavior is achieved via a distributed WM network, with distinct regions serving active versus passive task demands.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Learning to reinforce rewarding actions and avoid repeated mistakes is crucial for survival in dynamic environments. Yet, it remains unclear how distinct neural signals coordinate to implement reward-based decision-making and behavioural adjustment. We obtained simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry during a probabilistic reversal learning task. Leveraging single-trial EEG, we first replicate the presence of two feedback-locked neural representations; an early signal previously linked to alertness and switching behaviours following negative feedback and a late signal associated with value updating and reward learning. Using single-trial pupillometry, we then show that differences in feedback-evoked pupil responses between positive and negative feedback are driven primarily by negative feedback encoding. Jointly examining these EEG and pupillometry signatures, we show that following negative feedback, increased trial-by-trial coupling between the pupil response and the early, but not the late, EEG signal is linked to increased uncertainty and exploration tendency as well as reduced accuracy and evidence accumulation on the next trial. Consistent with previous research implicating the locus-coeruleus-noradrenaline system in uncertainty signalling and network resets, we propose that when internal estimates of contextual uncertainty are high following negative feedback, an early signal, likely regulated by locus coeruleus activity, implements a network reset in reward learning structures of a later learning signal. This interruption may simultaneously increase the neural gain related to the processing of novel information and decrease the influence of existing representations in reward learning structures, in turn improving performance by creating new, more accurate internal representations of the external world.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}

We measured performance in two tasks known to recruit early vs. late stages of auditory frequency tuning in early blind and sighted individuals with matched levels of musical training. The two groups showed equivalent performance on a tone detection in a notched-noise task that assesses peripheral and subcortical frequency selectivity. In contrast, early blind individuals showed enhanced performance in a pitch discrimination task thought to be mediated by cortical mechanisms. Computational modeling revealed that this enhancement was best explained by reduced internal noise rather than narrower frequency tuning, with both blindness and musical training predicting a reduction in internal noise. These findings identify internal noise as a key factor in experience-driven auditory plasticity as a result of both musical experience and early blindness.", "date": "2025-11-26", "journal": ""}
