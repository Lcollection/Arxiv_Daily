As a result, the replication rate and the selection pressure is reduced, potentially allowing the \"survival of everyone\". Here, we introduce a stochastic evolution model of replicating and hybridizing RNA strands to study the effect of product inhibition on evolution. We found that hybridization, though reducing the efficiency of replication, can increase the rate of evolution, measured as fitness gain within a period of time. The positive effect has been observed for a mutation error smaller than half of the error threshold. In this situation, frequency-dependent competition causes an increased diversity that spreads not only within a neutral network but also over various neutral networks through a dynamical modulation of the fitness landscape, resulting in a more effective search for better replicators. The underlying model is inspired by RNA virus replication and the RNA world hypothesis. Further investigations are needed to validate the actual effect of accelerated evolution through product inhibition in those systems.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Transcriptomic analyses have identified distinct molecular subtypes, but mechanistic differences that account for clinical differences are not clear. Here, we show that, as predicted by the motor-clutch model of cell migration, mesenchymal glioma cells are more spread, generate larger traction forces, and migrate faster in brain tissue compared to proneural cells. Despite their rapid migration and comparable proliferation rates in vitro, mice with mesenchymal tumors survive longer than those with proneural tumors. This improved survival correlated with an immune response in the mesenchymal tumors, including T cell-mediated. Consistently, inducing mesenchymal tumors in immunodeficient mice resulted in shorter survival supporting a protective immune role in mesenchymal tumors. Thus, mesenchymal tumors have aggressive migration, but are immunologically hot which suppresses net proliferation.

We use the robust locomotory responses of Caenorhabditis elegans to high levels of H2S to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its acute and adaptive responses. We find that the H2S-evoked behavioral response is shaped by multiple environmental factors including oxygen (O2) levels and nutritional state, and is modulated by various pathways such as insulin, TGF-{beta}, and HIF-1 signaling, as well as by input from O2-sensing neurons. Prolonged exposure to H2S activates HIF-1 signaling, leading to the upregulation of stress-responsive genes, including those involved in H2S detoxification. This promotes an adaptive state in which locomotory speed is reduced in H2S, while responsiveness to other stimuli is preserved. In mutants deficient in HIF-1 signaling, iron storage, and detoxification mechanisms, animals display a robust initial response but rapidly enter a sleep-like behavior characterized by reduced mobility and diminished responsiveness to subsequent sensory stimuli. Furthermore, while acute production of mitochondria-derived reactive O2 species (ROS) appears to initiate the avoidance response to H2S, persistently high ROS promotes an adaptive state, likely by activating various stress-response pathways, without substantially compromising cellular H2S detoxification capacity. Taken together, our study provides comprehensive molecular insights into the mechanisms through which C. elegans modulates and adapts its response to H2S exposure.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

We address these challenges by introducing nonparametric clustering of single-cell populations (NCLUSION): an infinite mixture model that leverages Bayesian sparse priors to identify marker genes while simultaneously performing clustering on single-cell expression data. NCLUSION uses a scalable variational inference algorithm to perform these analyses on datasets with up to millions of cells. Through simulations and analyses of publicly available scRNA-seq studies, we demonstrate that NCLUSION (i) matches the performance of other state-of-the-art clustering techniques with significantly reduced runtime and (ii) provides statistically robust and biologically relevant transcriptomic signatures for each of the clusters it identifies.

It is characterized by glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) composed of fibrillar alpha-synuclein (aSyn), whose formation shows parallels with prion propagation. While fibrils extracted from MSA brains have been structurally characterized, their ability to replicate in a protein-only manner has been questioned, and their capacity to induce GCIs in vivo remains unexplored. By contrast, the synthetic fibril strain 1B, assembled from recombinant human aSyn, self-replicates in vitro and induces GCIs in mice - suggesting direct relevance to MSA - but awaited scrutiny at an atomic scale. Here, we report high-resolution structural analyses of 1B fibrils and of fibrils extracted from diseased mice injected with 1B that developed GCIs (1BP). We show in vivo that conformational templating enables fibril strain replication, resulting in MSA-like inclusion pathology. Remarkably, the structures of 1B and 1BP are highly similar and mimic the fold of aSyn observed in one protofilament of fibrils isolated from MSA patients. Moreover, reinjection of crude mouse brain homogenates containing 1BP into new mice reproduces the same MSA-like pathology induced by the parent synthetic seed 1B.

Phylogenetic analysis of CT-type signaling has revealed the presence of CT-type peptides and CTR/CLR-type proteins in both deuterostome and protostome invertebrates. Furthermore, experimental studies have demonstrated that in the protostome Drosophila melanogaster the CT-like peptide DH31 can act as a ligand for a CTR/CLR-type receptor and a pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) receptor. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms and functions of CT-type neuropeptides in a deuterostome invertebrate, the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (phylum Echinodermata). In A. japonicus, a single gene encodes two CT-type peptides (AjCT1 and AjCT2) and both peptides act as ligands for a CTR/CLR-type receptor (AjCTR) and two PDF-type receptors (AjPDFR1, AjPDFR2), but with differential activation of downstream cAMP/PKA, Gq/Ca2+/PKC and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. AjCT1/AjCT2-encoding transcripts were detected in the central nervous system and a variety of organ systems and neuropeptide expression was visualized immunohistochemically using an antiserum to a starfish CT-type peptide (ArCT). In vitro pharmacological experiments demonstrated that AjCT1 and/or AjCT2 cause dose-dependent relaxation of longitudinal muscle and intestine preparations. Furthermore, in vivo pharmacological experiments, combined with gain- and loss-of-function experiments, revealed a potential physiological role for AjCT2/AjPDFR2 signaling in promoting feeding and growth in A. japonicus. To our knowledge, this is the first study to obtain evidence that CT-type peptides can act as ligands for both CTR/CLR-type and PDF-type receptors in a deuterostome. Moreover, it provides the first evidence for appetite-stimulating and growth-promoting effects of CT-type neuropeptides in bilaterians.

Single-cell transcriptomics studies have mapped the cellular landscape of human white adipose tissue (WAT). However, the vascular niche remains relatively undefined, especially regarding its heterogeneity, function, and role in metabolic disease. To address this gap, we created a single-cell transcriptome atlas of human subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), comprising nearly 70,000 vascular cells from 65 individuals. We characterized seven canonical adipose tissue endothelial cell (AdEC) subtypes and identified a distinct heterogenous population, here referred to as sub-AdECs. Sub-AdECs exhibit gene signatures characteristic of multiple cell types, including mesenchymal, adipocytic, and immune, suggesting they possess diverse properties and identities. Through computational analyses and whole-mount imaging, we validated the occurrence of sub-AdECs and show that these cells likely arise through endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), the modulation of which limits obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, we compared the transcriptomes of vascular cells from individuals living with or without obesity and type 2 diabetes and find metabolic disease-associated inflammatory and fibrotic transcriptomic patterns. The atlas and accompanying analyses establish a solid foundation for investigations into the biology of the adipose tissue vascular niche and its contribution to the pathogenesis of metabolic disease.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK+) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal neurons was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK+ neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, GPR30 in spinal CCK+ neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Moreover, GPR30 was expressed in spinal CCK+ neurons that received direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK+ neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain and GPR30 mediates descending facilitation by corticospinal direct projections, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we used Ifn{varepsilon}-/- mice and single-cell RNA sequencing to delineate IFN{varepsilon} function across distinct mucosal surfaces. In the FRT, Ifn{varepsilon} expression was restricted to specific epithelial subsets, was independent of estrous stage, and maintained basal ISG expression. IFN{varepsilon} was also retained intracellularly in primary human FRT-derived cells. Extending these analyses to the intestine, we found that IFN{varepsilon} is highly expressed in villous-tip enterocytes of the small intestine in vivo, where it sustains inflammatory enterocyte subsets and maintains type III IFN expression. Loss of Ifn{varepsilon} depleted these subsets and rendered mice more susceptible to enteric viral infection.

Protein kinase A (PKA), a kinase with ubiquitous distribution in most cells, functions as a specific negative regulator of the HH pathway. Its functional specificity in the HH pathway has been suggested to be controlled by cAMP in the PC. However, the regulation of PKA and its functions in PC remain unclear, in part due to the lack of observation of PKA localization in PC during HH resting state as well as conflicting reports of the dynamic changes of cAMP in cilia and HH pathway activity. To address this issue, we have developed a ciliary-localized FRET-based A-kinase activity probe (Nphp3N-AKAR2-CR) as an improved biosensor for monitoring real-time PKA activity in the PC of both cultured cells and living zebrafish embryos. Although the PKA catalytic subunit (PKA-C) was not observed in PC, basal PKA activity in cells could be detected with this probe. In addition, we have found that only ciliary-targeted PKA and not cytosolic PKA, can modulate the HH pathway, even when the integrity of the PC is disrupted. Notably, ciliary PKA activity was barely changed either by inhibition or activation of the HH pathway at the level of Smoothened (SMO), the obligate HH signal transducer. Moreover, we found that even low concentration of the adenylyl cyclase agonist forskolin (FSK) can efficiently inhibit the HH pathway in the presence of the constitutively active variant SMOA1, suggesting that the activation of the HH pathway by SMO may not be due solely to direct regulation of PKA activity in the PC.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a novel Mn-dependent mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction to neuroinflammation. We found that Mn disrupts mitochondrial transcriptome processing, resulting in the accumulation of complementary RNAs that form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This dsRNA is released to the cytoplasm, where it activates cytosolic sensor pathways, triggering type I interferon responses and inflammatory cytokine production. This mechanism is evident in 100-day human cerebral organoids, where Mn-induced inflammatory responses are observed predominantly in mature astrocytes. Similar effects were observed in the transcriptome and cytokine profile of female and male mouse brains carrying mutations in the SLC30A10 gene, a model of hypermanganesemia with dystonia1 disorder.

Haplotypes, which combine alleles from adjacent variants, offer several advantages over bi-allelic SNPs, including enhanced information content, reduced dimensionality, and improved statistical power in genomic studies. These benefits are particularly significant for polyploid species, where distinguishing all homologous copies using SNP markers alone can be challenging. This article introduces HaploCharmer, a flexible workflow designed for read-scale haplotype calling from NGS data. HaploCharmer identifies haplotypes within preconfigured genomic regions smaller than a sequencing read, ensuring direct comparability across individuals. It integrates a series of processing steps including mapping, haplotype identification, filtration, and reporting of haplotype sequences, as presence-absence, in the panel of accessions analyzed. The performance of HaploCharmer was validated by building a genetic map using whole-genome sequencing data from a highly polyploid sugarcane cultivar (R570) and its self-progeny, and performing a diversity analysis in the polyploid Saccharum genus using targeted sequencing data. The workflow successfully identified a large number of high-quality haplotypes, with less than 1% of false positives. The dense genetic map obtained using single-dose haplotypes accurately depicted the known genome architecture of the R570 cultivar, including large chromosome rearrangements. The diversity analysis accurately reflected the known genetic structure within this genus. It also allowed inferring ancestral origins to mapped haplotypes and the corresponding chromosome segments in the R570 genetic map. HaploCharmer provides a robust method for diversity, genetic mapping, and quantitative genetics studies in both diploid and polyploid species.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

We propose a systems principle of timescale normalization for coordinated signal-energy balance, in which healthy brains reconcile variable internal clocks so that inter-regional activity remains energetically proportionate over time. To operationalize this principle, we time-align regional fMRI signals via a time-resolved dynamic time-warping method that removes temporal distortions and isolates moment-to-moment amplitude differences. The residual amplitudes define a dynamic signal-energy disparity metric, quantifying coordination across intrinsic networks. Validation in the Human Connectome Project cohort (n = 1,200) demonstrated robust adherence to this system principle. Applied to a multi-site schizophrenia cohort (controls=160, patients=151), the approach revealed more heterogeneous signal-energy disparities in patients, particularly during faster fluctuations. State-switching analyses further showed that patients occupied and re-entered less balanced configurations more frequently, characterized by reduced spectral gap and longer mixing time, indicating slower re-stabilization of balanced energy states, greater heterogeneity and sluggish re-stabilization were associated with higher symptom severity and poorer working memory and reasoning. In summary, schizophrenia reflects a breakdown of timescale normalization, producing heterogeneous disparities in signal energy and impaired recovery of balanced network states. These findings establish dynamic signal-energy balance as a core systems mechanism directly linked to symptoms, cognition, and potential intervention monitoring.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed Nanopore Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) to investigate the transcriptome and epitranscriptome landscape of the MS2 in infected E. coli throughout multiple life cycles. We discovered that MS2 phages sustain a high level of transcriptional activity required for replication. We found large amounts of subgenomic small transcripts from RNA degradation, Nanopore DRS bias, and transcripts containing the coat-encoding region, required for virion assembly. We found hybrid reads due to the error-prone activity of the MS2 replicase complex by the template-switching mechanism. We evidenced that RNA modification is conserved throughout the entire life cycle in full-length transcripts without the acquisition of new modifications, whereas small transcripts did acquire newly modified sites. The conserved sequence and secondary structure (U-rich hairpin) of {Psi} installation sites were the most amenable to RNA modification, and one site aligned well with host RluA-mediated installation.

In Arabidopsis, a thermo-sensitive module of salicylic acid (SA) signaling makes immunity vulnerable to heat. The potent resistance inducer acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), an SA analogue that up-regulates transcription of defense genes, could restore plant protection under heat but not core SA signaling. Here, we investigated how high temperature rewires the ASM-induced responses of the apple immune system. We treated apple plants with ASM under contrasting heatwave scenarios and subsequently exposed them to Erwinia amylovora (the fire blight bacterium) or Venturia inaequalis (the apple scab fungus) while monitoring gene expression. While pre-exposing apple plants to high temperature did not change their susceptibility to pathogens, it drove a loss of ASM-induced protection. Transcriptomic analysis revealed broad dampening of ASM-regulation upon high temperature, for a wide range of biological processes beyond defense. We uncovered thermo-sensitive \"resistance\" and \"susceptibility\" marker genes with ASM-responsiveness being critically vulnerable to heat. We concluded that exposure to heatwave prevents ASM from fully mounting its protective responses in apple, not only lowering defenses but also offering more favorable hosting conditions. Our work highlights plant immunity as the joint outcome of resistant and susceptible responses.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Results show that stroke patients exhibited significantly prolonged INT in multiple cortical regions, reflecting slowed temporal dynamics and disrupted hierarchy. These dynamic changes persisted through recovery and were more pronounced in patients with poor outcomes, especially within cognitive control networks. Computational modelling suggested that stroke-induced INT prolongation driven by heightened neuronal excitability reflects a dynamic shift towards criticality.

The approach integrates subject-specific MRI data with finite element modeling (FEM) used to simulate the sensitivity of subdural and intracortical devices. Sensitivity maps, or lead fields, from these models enable the comparison of different electrode placements, contact sizes, contact configurations, and substrate properties, which are often overlooked factors. One tool is a genetic algorithm that optimizes electrode placement by maximizing information capacity.

We constructed taxonomic and functional profiles of active chemolithoautotrophs, examined population distributions across sites, and linked primary producers to their specific metabolic strategies within the subseafloor community. Dominant autotrophs exhibited hydrogen-dependent dissimilatory metabolisms such as sulfur and nitrate reduction and methanogenesis, as well as microaerophilic sulfide oxidation even at 80{degrees}C, consistent with fluid chemistries at each site. While hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea such as Methanothermococcus were restricted in their distribution and activity, hydrogenotrophic sulfur and nitrate reducers from the Aquificota (Thermovibrio), Campylobacterota (Nautiliaceae, Hydrogenimonas, and Desulfurobacteriaceae) were consistently active and present at all sites and years at both the population and community levels. Hydrogenase transcripts were significantly differentially expressed, and diverse hydrogenases were found in metagenome-assembled genomes of Aquificota members, highlighting the importance and versatility of their hydrogen utilization strategies which likely contribute to their cosmopolitan distribution across geochemically disparate subseafloor sites.

In this study we combined measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and quantity with microbial community data from a small Arctic catchment. Our aim was to understand how the catchment is affected by two sub-catchments, degrading palsa permafrost mire and peatland thawing in spring. The small thaw ponds in the palsa mire were clearly distinct from the rest of the catchment and ponds in the peatland. Palsa ponds had higher DOM quantity, more aromatic DOM and distinct microbial communities. Thus, our results point towards analogous and low export rates of organic matter from the permafrost mire and peatland to the receiving small streams. Instead, the DOM is being retained and metabolised within the small ponds in both palsa mire and peatland. We also detected high abundances of ultra-small Patescibacteria.

Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of TbAQP2 from Trypanosoma brucei, bound to either the substrate glycerol or to the sleeping sickness drugs, pentamidine or melarsoprol. The drugs bind within the AQP2 channel at a site completely overlapping that of glycerol. Mutations leading to a drug-resistant phenotype were found in the channel lining. Molecular dynamics simulations showed the channel can be traversed by pentamidine, with a low energy binding site at the centre of the channel, flanked by regions of high energy association at the extracellular and intracellular ends. Drug-resistant TbAQP2 mutants are still predicted to bind pentamidine, but the much weaker binding in the centre of the channel observed in the MD simulations would be insufficient to compensate for the high energy processes of ingress and egress, hence impairing transport at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.

Reverse electron transfer (RET), defined as the upstream flow of electrons from the quinone pool to complex I, is a major source of pathological reactive oxygen species (ROS) under stress conditions. Using an in vivo model of brain IR, we show that RET-supporting substrates (succinate and glycerol 3-phosphate) accumulate during oxygen deprivation. Rapid oxidation of these substrates by brain mitochondria upon reoxygenation drives massive ROS production, while also leading to over-reduction and dissociation of the complex I flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor. The resulting FMN-deficient complex I becomes catalytically impaired, unable to oxidize NADH or to produce ROS. To mitigate RET and preserve complex I function, we used transgenic mice xenotopically expressing alternative oxidase (AOX). This enzyme bypasses complexes III and IV by directly oxidizing the reduced quinone pool and passing electrons onto molecular oxygen. AOX expression did not alter complex I abundance, supercomplexes assembly, or basal respiration rates, but effectively diverted electrons from the quinone pool, decreasing RET flux via complex I and limiting ROS generation during IR. This attenuation of RET preserved complex I FMN binding, suppressed oxidative stress, and conferred neuroprotection in vivo. Our findings reveal a novel strategy for rewiring mitochondrial electron flux to mitigate initial IR brain injury, highlighting modulation of the quinone pool by AOX as a potential therapeutic strategy for IR.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

PAR1 connects the coagulation cascade, endothelial cells and CD8 T cells at the site of endothelial inflammation and we hypothesized that HIV driven CD8 T cell immune activation alters endothelial repair mechanisms. Endothelial repair is partially mediated by angiogenic T (Tang) cells that facilitate proliferation of endothelial cells, and differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells at site of vascular injury. During LCMV infection, we identified a subset of CD31highCD8 T cells that exhibited a long-lived memory precursor phenotype (CD127+KLRG1-) and secreted the proangiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after viral control. Furthermore, in PWH, the frequencies of CD8 Tang cells were reduced and showed an activated phenotype and expression of granzymes. GZMA+GZMB+CD8 Tang cells correlated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. In vitro, granzyme dependent PAR1 activation led to calcium mobilization and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and angiopoietin-2 by primary human endothelial cells.

In plants the months-to-years long timeline associated with prototyping putative tissue-specific promoters in transgenic lines deepens this challenge. We have developed a novel strategy called Ribozyme Enabled Tissue Specificity (RETS) that leverages the knowledge of where and when genes are expressed derived from transcriptomic studies to enable tissue specific expression without needing characterized promoters. It uses a split self-splicing ribozyme based on a group I intron from Tetrahymena thermophila to enable conditional reconstitution of a transgene mRNA in the presence of a secondary tissue-specific mRNA of choice. We elucidate the design features that enable flexible swapping of transgenes and targets, enhancing transgene expression, and circumventing host RNA interference responses. We then show that these innovations enable tissue-specific and dose-dependent expression of transgenes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of RETS both for creating genetically encoded biosensors to study the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in planta as well as for engineering tissue-specific changes in organ size. RETS provides a novel avenue to study expression patterns of native loci with non-destructive imaging, complementing the weakness of existing approaches. Additionally, the spatiotemporal control of transgene expression afforded by RETS enables precision engineering of plant phenotypes which will facilitate enhancing crops without the trade-offs associated with constitutive expression.\n\nSignificance StatementWe have developed a novel platform, called Ribozyme Enabled Tissue Specificity (RETS), that enables precision expression of transgenes in specific plant tissues without needing to spend months-to-years prototyping tissue-specific promoters.

The various stereoisomers of copalyl diphosphate establish the greater family of labdane natural products, many of which have environmental and medicinal impact. Understanding structure-function relationships in class II diterpene synthases is crucial for guiding protein engineering campaigns aimed at the generation of diverse bicyclic diterpene scaffolds. However, only a limited number of structures are available for class II cyclases from bacteria, plants, and humans, and no structures are available for a class II cyclase from a fungus. Further, bifunctional class II terpene synthases have not been investigated with regard to substrate channeling between the prenyltransferase and the cyclase. Here, we report the 2.9 [A]-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 63-kD class II cyclase domain from PvCPS. Comparisons with bacterial and plant copalyl diphosphate synthases reveal conserved residues that likely guide the formation of the bicyclic labdane core, but divergent catalytic dyads that mediate the final deprotonation step of catalysis.

How the nucleus reacts to these mechanical cues, ensuring a tight balance between mechano-protection and mechanotransduction, is a key yet unresolved question. Here we dissect the spatio-temporal control of nuclear mechanostransduction during EMT, using Drosophila mesoderm invagination as a model. We found that two conserved pro-EMT genes respond differently to compressive forces: while snail transcription remains unaffected, compression is sufficient to activate twist transcription within seconds. We further revealed a spatially patterned genome-wide transcriptional response to EMT forces, with an apical mechanoprotection contrasting with a permissive basal nuclear environment. The direct recording of nascent transcription in response to a controlled nuclear micromanipulation provides compelling evidence of nuclear heterogeneity in the transcriptional response to forces. Overall, these results reveal that EMT nuclei respond directly and rapidly to mechanical forces, in a spatially defined pattern.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we establish a mouse model of motor tics by unilateral striatal injection of a GABAA receptor antagonist. This model induces c-Fos activation in both motor and limbic structures, including the insular cortex (IC). Fiber photometry reveals tic-associated activity in IC as well as the primary motor cortex (M1). Viral tracing demonstrates that basal ganglia outputs from the substantia nigra pars reticulata are transmitted to IC via the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (ITN). Chemogenetic inhibition of IC or the thalamo-insular pathway suppresses tic-related cortical activity and alleviates tic-like behaviors. These findings identify IC as a key node in tic generation and highlight ITN as critical relay stations linking motor and limbic circuits. Aberrant thalamo-insular signaling thus contributes to the pathophysiology of tic disorders and represents a potential therapeutic target in TS.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

SHANK3 encodes a synaptic scaffolding protein essential for neurodevelopment and synaptic function, and aberrant SHANK3 methylation has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. To enable reliable locus-specific investigation of SHANK3 epigenetic regulation, we developed a high-resolution melting (HRM) assay. In silico screening identified a CpG-rich region upstream of exon 3 as the most suitable locus for assay design. Bisulfite-converted sequences representing fully methylated and unmethylated states were used to generate three primer sets, of which two successfully amplified the target region and produced distinct melting profiles discriminating methylated from unmethylated templates. The assay was optimized on two HRM platforms (LightCycler 480 and CFX96), and conversion efficiency was confirmed with commercial control DNAs. This locus-specific HRM assay provides a methodological framework for qualitative SHANK3 methylation analysis and represents a promising tool for future validation studies and potential clinical investigations in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Using ultra-high-resolution 7T fMRI with dense within-subject sampling (N=3), we quantified whole-brain activity, functional and effective connectivity, cortical gradients, and eigenmodes, and related them to chemoarchitecture and cognitive maps. EC is marked by increased activity in unimodal regions, down-regulation in transmodal regions, subcortex, and brainstem, an expansion of the principal gradient, and decrease in low-order global eigenmodes. Cognitive decoding linked EC to heightened perceptual clarity and attention, least with mental suffering, and co-varied with histaminergic H receptors topology. These findings challenge predictions of Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory, while supporting the Active Inference Framework. More broadly, EC demonstrates that consciousness can cease without global suppression, suggesting a potential 'reset' mechanism that fosters equanimity and the potential for flourishing.

We map the resulting cellular phase transition with our high-throughput live-cell assay, measuring the tipping point that separates healthy cells from those burdened with large aggregate loads. Using super-resolution imaging of brain tissue from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, we quantify how the crucial balance of accumulation and removal is shifted in disease. Combined with in vitro aggregation kinetics, we then validate our framework by predicting how designed aggregation inhibitors shift the tipping point to restore cellular homeostasis.

The molecular details of this evolution remain puzzling. In this work, we determine crystal structures and explore dynamical behavior of a bifunctional ancestral ABH-fold enzyme, highlighting molecular features associated with the transition from hydrolytic to oxygenolytic catalysis at this fold. Structures showed a canonical {beta}-sandwich shielded with a helical cap domain. The catalytic pocket is voluminous enough to accommodate a bulky substrate. Molecular docking showed productive binding of the coelenterazine substrate, as well as the product coelenteramide. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the coelenterazine entry does not present a major energetic barrier and identified a preferred binding orientation important for oxygenolytic catalysis. Comparisons between ancestral and extant enzymes highlighted specific amino acids and sequence motifs characteristic for oxygenolytic luciferases.

The oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance hypothesis (OCLTTH) posits that aerobic scope (AS), the difference between standard and maximal metabolic rate, underpins other ecologically relevant metrics of performance. Here we assess short- and long-term thermal tolerance of benthic and limnetic ecotypes of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) fish through common garden measurements of heritable variation in AS and parasite immunity. We predicted that benthic fish would display higher thermal tolerance resulting from adaptation to the relatively large thermal fluctuations in the shallow lakes that they inhabit. Based on the OCLTTH, we also expected that AS would decline with temperature and be a precursor for reduced condition. Although data connecting parasite immunity and temperature are limited, we predicted oxygen limitation would impair parasite resistance at higher temperature, particularly in the high-immunity limnetic fish. Despite exposing fish to temperatures below their thermal maxima, survival decreased with temperature and was most pronounced in limnetic fish at the highest temperature. The evolved thermal resilience of benthic stickleback was associated with their AS stability, suggesting that at least some populations of this keystone species are capable of withstanding hotter climates. However, contrary to the OCLTTH, temperature associated changes in AS were not associated with declines in fish condition or immunity.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

While industry-standard practice relies on liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry to assess oligonucleotide identity and purity, more recent FDA guidance recommends complementary base-by-base sequence analysis (FDA CBER Webinar, 2024).\n\nIn this study, we evaluated next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategies for characterizing chemically synthesized gRNAs. We found that the widely used SMARTer assay, while capable of producing sequenceable libraries, introduced substantial artifacts during library preparation. These included truncated scaffold species at oligo(A) stretches in the scaffold region and 5'(n-1) deletions within the spacer sequence. Although absent in the original gRNA, these artifacts accounted for over 10% of the sequencing reads, creating the false appearance of impurities. Through experimental and computational approaches, we traced these artifacts to mispriming by template-switching oligonucleotides (TSOs). Importantly, these artifacts occur during sequencing, and although they do not reflect real gRNA impurities, they compromise assay accuracy and can obscure true sequence impurities.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we developed FUSS-seq (Full-length Uncoupled Second-strand Synthesis followed by sequencing), a novel assay that integrates principles from 5' RACE with a modified TSO bearing a 3' polymerase-blocking moiety. FUSS-seq markedly reduced artifacts and increased full-length gRNA recovery, providing a more accurate and lower-bias method for gRNA purity assessment.

We evaluated the feasibility and intestinal sparing potential of FLASH irradiation using a clinical synchrocyclotron-based proton therapy system generating a pulsed beam. Material and methods: C57BL/6J mice received abdominal irradiation (2*2 cm) in transmission mode at FLASH (>60 Gy/s) or conventional (CONV, 0.5 Gy/s) dose rates using a 230 MeV superconducting synchrocyclotron proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) system. Two independent irradiation rounds were performed. Endpoints included 75-day survival, regenerating crypt counts, whole blood counts at day 4, and intestinal wall thickness, cyst-like structures, and cytokine levels at day 75. Results: In the first irradiation round, survival after 14.5 Gy FLASH was markedly improved (5/8 survivors) compared to CONV (0/8), whereas in the second round survival rates were identical (2/7 per group). Overall, pooled data indicated improved survival with 14.5 Gy FLASH. The LD50 was 13.74 Gy in CONV and 14.48 Gy in FLASH mode, corresponding to a FLASH modifying factor of 0.95. FLASH at 14.5 Gy increased regenerating crypt numbers compared to CONV, but only in the first round, supporting survival outcomes.

To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others.

Predictive models, called epigenetic clocks, are being built across the tree of life, including humans, other mammals and vertebrates and, recently, invertebrates. However, it always involves cross-fertilizing organisms, thus presenting a high level of genetic diversity. To decipher the exact role of epigenetics in adaptation and evolution, distinguishing true epigenetic variation from changes that reflect genetic variation is essential. Results: Here, we used the mangrove rivulus, the only self-fertilizing vertebrate, to study epigenetic aging in the brain and construct an epigenetic clock. We generated a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing dataset of 90 brain tissues from individuals aged 60-1100 days to construct a highly accurate age predictor using 40 CpG sites (R squared > 0.96, mean absolute error of 28.7 days). We associated the CpG sites with their respective closest genes and explored their biological functions. Genes relevant to aging include lamin-A (responsible for several age-related processes), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (whose absence causes premature aging) and several genes associated with Alzheimer's disease identified in human studies. We also propose several methods to improve classic epigenetic clock regression. Conclusions: This study is the first construction of an epigenetic clock in a self-fertilizing species, demonstrating that DNA methylation patterns undergo consistent changes across the lifespan of isogenic individuals.

For this, the locations of chromosomes in the nucleus or relative to spindle poles are crucial: indeed, chromosomes at the nuclear periphery or behind spindle poles (polar regions) have a higher risk of missegregation in the subsequent anaphase. The actomyosin network (PANEM) is formed on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope during prophase, and its myosin-II-dependent contraction facilitates kinetochore-microtubule interaction shortly after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). However, it remains unclear which step of kinetochore-microtubule interaction is facilitated by the PANEM contraction, or which chromosomes specifically benefit from it. Here we show that the PANEM contraction pushes chromosomes located at the nuclear periphery inward immediately after NEBD. This facilitates kinetochores' initial interaction with spindle microtubules, but does not affect their subsequent poleward motion. The PANEM contraction also promotes the onset of their congression towards the spindle mid-plane, but does not affect congression itself once it starts. Furthermore, the PANEM contraction reduces the volume of polar regions, and helps chromosomes exit these regions and initiate their congression. Impaired PANEM contraction results in defective chromosome congression and frequent chromosome mis-segregation. In conclusion, shortly after NEBD, the PANEM contraction repositions chromosomes from the nuclear periphery and polar regions to facilitate productive kinetochore-microtubule interaction and ensure high-fidelity chromosome segregation.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

This contrasts markedly with clinical (human) medicine where lipid vacuoles in RPTEC are usually associated with metabolic or chronic disease, such as CKD. Despite domestic felids having a high incidence of CKD as they age, no study has fully characterised feline RPTEC lipid droplets in the context of CKD. Here, we first characterised the incidence of RPTEC lipid in domestic cat (with/without CKD or chronic interstitial nephritis) versus domestic dog and Scottish Wildcat, across a wide age range. Felids (domestic, wildcat) consistently had greater renal lipid content than dogs at all ages studied. Intracytoplasmic lipid extraction with chromatography, fatty acid characterisation and mass spectrometry-based lipidomics revealed unusual presence of a panoply of novel lipids found only in domestic cat: lipids were primarily modified (i.e. less polar) ether-soluble triacylglycerols including monoalkyldiacylglycerols (MADAGs) and other branched-chain fatty acids. We suggest common presence of such rare lipid species in tubular lipid droplets in domestic cat reflects an aspect of felid biology that parallels age-related disease prevalence, in particular, being associated with the aetiopathogenesis of chronic renal interstitial nephritis (CIN), a hallmark of CKD in felids.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the kinetics and mechanism of the MIC telomere elimination. Comparison of the MIC and MAC genome sequences indicated that the MIC telomeres are excised from chromosomes as part of larger MIC-limited sequences (MLSs) through chromosomal breakage. We confirmed this using an optimized oligo-FISH protocol and and found that their elimination occurs in parallel with other programmed DNA elimination processes. CRISPR-Cas9 disruption of a MLS-associated Chromosome Breakage Sequence (CBS) showed that elimination of the MLS was not blocked but instead led to loss of adjacent MAC-destined sequence (MDS), suggesting abnormal co-elimination. In biparental crosses of the CBS mutant, however, both MLS and MDS were retained, DNA elimination was broadly disrupted, and no viable progeny were produced. These findings indicate that chromosome breakage at MLS-associated CBSs is essential for the proper separation of MLSs and MDSs, ensuring correct DNA elimination and successful sexual progeny development.

Here, we report a modular diagnostic and antiviral platform based on designer DNA nanostructures engineered for high-affinity recognition of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (GP120). A custom DNA aptamer, termed HINT, was developed to bind GP120 across major HIV-1 subtypes (Groups M and P; subtypes A and B) with nanomolar affinity. To amplify binding strength, HINT aptamers were spatially patterned onto a net-shaped DNA nanostructure (DNA-NetHINT) that geometrically matches the trimeric GP120 spikes on the viral surface. Using multivalent interactions, the nanostructure enabled up to 104-fold improvement in binding affinity (sub-picomolar KD), confirmed by surface plasmon resonance. Integration of DNA-NetHINT into a paper-based lateral flow assay produced a low-cost, saliva-compatible self-testing device capable of detecting intact HIV-1 virions at concentrations as low as 328 viral copies per test, outperforming commercial fourth-generation rapid diagnostic tests. In addition to its diagnostic capabilities, the DNA-NetHINT construct exhibited potent antiviral activity, reducing pseudovirus infection with an EC50 of ~1.8nM, nearly 1,000-fold more effective than free aptamers. This work demonstrates a dual-function DNA nanotechnology platform that enables both ultrasensitive HIV-1 detection and entry inhibition.

R.; Khaperskyy, D.", "abstract": "The polymerase acidic (PA) protein is a subunit of the trimeric influenza A virus (IAV) RNAdependent RNA polymerase and the target of the anti-influenza drug baloxavir marboxil (BXM). As with other direct-acting antivirals, treatment with BXM can lead to selection of viruses carrying resistance mutations. If these mutations have negligible fitness costs, resistant viruses can spread widely and render existing treatments obsolete. Multiple BXM resistance mutations in the nuclease domain of PA have been identified, with I38T and I38M amino acid substitutions occurring frequently. These mutations have minimal to no effects on viral polymerase activity, virus replication, or transmission. However, for reasons that are not well understood, viruses with BXM resistance substitutions have not been able to compete with parental wild-type strains. The IAV genome segment encoding PA also encodes the host shutoff nuclease PA-X, which shares the endonuclease domain with PA but has a unique C-terminal domain generated by ribosomal frameshifting during translation. Unlike their effects on PA activity, the effects of BXM or the I38T/M substitutions on PA-X function remain uncharacterized. In our work, for the first time, we directly examine the effects of baloxavir and the I38T/M substitutions on PA-X activity and show that baloxavir inhibits PA-X activity in a dose dependent manner. Most importantly, we also demonstrate that the I38T/M mutations significantly impair the host shutoff activity of PA-X proteins from different IAV strains of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 subtypes.

It also acts as a chromatin remodeling enzyme through ATP-dependent exchange of nucleosomal H2A-H2B dimers with H2A.Z-H2B, leading to incorporation of H2A.Z into chromatin at gene regulatory elements. NuA4/TIP60 is unique in merging two enzymatic activities targeting H2A.Z.

Our data support a mechanism in which H2A.Z is first pre-acetylated to allow for H2A.Zac-H2B dimer association with the complex before incorporation into chromatin, particularly at gene promoters to positively regulate transcription.

While its dysregulation is linked to developmental disorders, cancer, and aging, the mechanisms guiding PRC2 to specific genomic loci remain a subject of ongoing debate. A prevailing model proposes that PRC2 recruitment occurs via its intrinsic affinity for chromatin rather than through sequence-specific transcription factors. Here, we provide evidence that the maternally deposited pioneer transcription factor Foxh1 plays a critical role in directing PRC2 to specific genomic loci during zygotic genome activation in Xenopus. Foxh1 is a critical transcription factor mediating Nodal signaling, but it also plays an earlier role by pre-binding enhancers prior to signaling activation. This pre-binding is essential for forming enhanceosome complexes that trigger mesendodermal gene expression and drive gastrulation, in cooperation with other maternal transcription factors. Using maternal Foxh1-null embryos, we demonstrate that Foxh1 directly recruits Ezh2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2, to Foxh1-bound loci. Loss of Foxh1 impairs Ezh2 recruitment, leading to a global reduction in H3K27me3. These findings support a dual-function model in which Foxh1 not only activates endodermal gene expression in endoderm, but also recruits PRC2 to silence the same genes in ectoderm. This dual activity of Foxh1 allows the spatially coordinated epigenetic states of the endodermal gene regulatory program during early embryogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

These results demonstrate that beta burst features reorganize with practice, providing a temporally precise neural readout of training progression and revealing how different learning conditions shape cortical dynamics over time.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Descending corticofugal pathways have been implicated in learning but there is limited evidence that subcortical processing is shaped by training. We show that sound-source location can be accurately decoded from neuronal populations recorded in the inferior colliculus of one or both hemispheres while ferrets perform a localization task. Furthermore, changes in neural decoding performance matched improvements in localization accuracy of individual animals when ferrets were trained to adapt to abnormal spatial cues resulting from reversible occlusion of one ear. These findings demonstrate that the activity patterns of populations of neurons in the inferior colliculus can account for sound localization behavior in different hearing contexts, and that training-dependent plasticity in the auditory midbrain may support spatial learning following monaural hearing loss.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

S.; Schmitt, T.; Frank, E. T.", "abstract": "Injuries and infections pose a significant threat to fitness. Animals cope with this problem by performing self-medication or receiving social care from members of the group. While the benefits of care in increasing survival are clear, the forces leading to the evolution of these helping behaviours are not fully understood. Contrary to the current hypothesis that helping behaviours, such as social wound care, are more likely to evolve in small groups due to the high relative value of an individual, we demonstrate that social wound care evolved in the army ant Eciton burchellii, a species that hunts pugnacious prey and has colonies of ~1 million ants. Our theoretical model shows how injury rate and lethality are fundamental drivers for care rather than group size. Wound care significantly increased survival in ants with infected wounds through two distinct care phases: a first aid at the hunting site through wound grooming, and another at the bivouac with antimicrobial secretions. This species is the first to provide care at the hunting site, thereby minimising the time to receive help, a critical variable in lowering mortality and accelerating the colony's reproductive rate. By rejecting the notion that high individual value is required for the evolution of helping, our study reveals that injury-driven care can emerge as a vital and widespread feature in even the largest insect societies.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

These benefits persisted even when transplanted cells remained confined to the meninges and were reproduced by the neonatal microglia secretome, indicating a paracrine mechanism. Multi-omic profiling revealed that the neonatal secretome is enriched in trophic factors and membrane-building lipids compared to adult microglia, while transcriptomic analyses of treated aged brains showed reactivation of developmental repair pathways and suppression of inflammatory signatures. Together, these results demonstrate that neonatal microglia re-engage rejuvenation-like programs in the adult CNS and highlight the importance of multifactorial strategies, integrating trophic, metabolic, and immunomodulatory cues, over single-target approaches.

Here, we investigate whether the population structure modularity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) increases with sensorimotor remapping between task rules in two different paradigms. In a paradigm where all stimuli were remapped, we found a highly modular structure with two task-specialized subpopulations and one generalist. In a different paradigm where only half of the stimuli were remapped, modularity decreased but remained significant.

However, how these residual symptoms relate to structural brain changes in the post-acute phase remains unclear. Recently, fractal dimensionality (FD) has emerged as a sensitive imaging marker of structural brain complexity in related conditions but has not been explored in autoimmune encephalitis. Methods: This cross-sectional study combined clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging analyses in 70 patients with post-acute NMDARE (median time from onset: 22 months), and 70 healthy controls matched for age (t=-0.57, p=0.57) and sex ({chi}2=0, p=1). High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were analyzed with FreeSurfer and computational fractal analysis. Clinical outcomes were assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). Psychiatric manifestations underwent phenotypical analyses, and memory performance was assessed with standardized neuropsychological tests. Results: Patients with NMDARE were severely affected at peak illness but showed substantial overall improvement in the post-acute stage (median mRS at peak=5, post-acute=1, z=-7.2, p<0.001; median CASE at peak=11, post-acute=1, z=-7.2, p<0.001). However, 67% of patients showed residual CASE symptoms, with memory dysfunction (61%) and psychiatric symptoms (36%) representing the most prevalent domains. Therein, psychiatric symptoms showed a phenotypical shift from a 'schizophrenia-like' phenotype at peak illness to an affective phenotype in the post-acute stage. Neuroimaging uncovered a characteristic pattern of reduced structural brain complexity, including the hippocampus bilaterally and a fronto-cingulo-temporal cluster in cortical gray matter and cerebral white matter. Importantly, normative modeling revealed that patients with residual symptoms showed stronger alterations of brain complexity than those without (psychiatric: t=-2.65, p=0.010; memory: t=-3.98, p<0.001; both vs. no symptoms: t=-5.46, p<0.001). Similarly, patients with stronger alterations of brain complexity showed lower scores of visuospatial and verbal memory (all pFDR<0.015). Discussion: Post-acute NMDARE is characterized by systematic reductions in structural brain complexity, consistently involving previously implicated regions while identifying changes in the cingulate cortex as a new morphological correlate. These changes are linked to residual psychiatric symptoms and memory dysfunction, highlighting FD as a promising new imaging marker of long-term outcomes. Our findings suggest that current treatment strategies may be insufficient to fully address the residual symptom burden after the acute phase of NMDARE.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

While T1-weighted (T1w) image-based ROI registration is well validated and widely adopted in cortical fMRI, its performance degrades in brainstem studies due to the small size, dense packing, and poor visibility of brainstem nuclei on T1w contrast. We hypothesized that incorporating diffusion MR images, containing more information about internal brainstem architecture, should improve ROI registration accuracy. To test this, we developed four registration pipelines that either included or excluded diffusion-based alignment components and evaluated their performance using data from n=10 healthy participants. Registration accuracy was assessed using Dice coefficients for the red nucleus (RN) and mis-registration fractions for the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The results showed that diffusion-based pipelines, using fractional anisotropy (FA) images, non-diffusion-weighted (b0) images, and multivariate combination, outperformed the T1w-only baseline. Probabilistic maps derived from inverse-transformed native ROIs further supported improved sensitivity to inter-individual anatomical variability in the diffusion-augmented pipelines. In addition, analysis of gradient magnitude maps from the Jacobian determinants revealed associations between localized deformation and image modality-specific landmarks. These findings demonstrate the potential of diffusion-augmented pipelines for improving brainstem ROI registration, which could enhance the robustness of fMRI studies on brainstem disorders characterized by functional dysregulation.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

ATRX:CST synthetic lethality manifests following accumulation of telomeric G-rich ssDNA, which results in telomere loss and cell death. Conversely, we attribute ATRX:9-1-1 synthetic lethality to genome-wide ssDNA lesions, which compromise DNA replication. We further show ATRX suppresses DNA damage during replication stress by counteracting the activity of the FAM111A protease. We demonstrate that roles of ATRX in telomere maintenance and replication are genetically separable requiring its ATPase activity and PIP-box, respectively, and independently of its DAXX interaction. Collectively, functions of ATRX in suppressing toxic ssDNA lesions are context-dependent and are key to global DNA replication and telomere integrity.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

These fibres continue to grow by addition of new myonuclei through reiterative rounds of myocyte fusion to support muscle growth, repair and regeneration over the organism's life span.

We demonstrate that during the initial phase of myogenesis, mymx has a spatiotemporally varying expression across all axes of the developing myotome.

Yet, by the end of organogenesis, internal organ structure is typically robustly defined, with cells tightly packed. It remains an open question as to how the three-dimensional (3D) internal structure of an organ emerges reliably, particularly when there are multiple cell types interacting and dynamic boundary constraints. Here, we utilise quantitative live imaging and 3D morphological measures of the developing zebrafish myotome to unravel how early muscle organisation emerges. Contrary to the textbook view of muscle fibres as cylindrical, myocytes undergo an ordered chiral twist, the direction and magnitude of which depends on their position within the myotome. Further, cells skew and rearrange, seemingly to facilitate close packing of neighbouring muscle fibres. Cell movement undergoes a rapid decline in speed once the cells span the myotome segment. We find that cell packing is altered in mutants that disrupt cell fate or cell fusion, even though the final muscle segments remain largely confluent. Biophysical perturbation reveals that the cells are mechanically plastic, able to adjust to changes in the local cellular environment and boundary constraints. Taking these results together, we propose that the early myotome undergoes a structural transition, from a fluid-like state into a frozen state, resembling glass-like behaviour.

Post-mortem brainstem tissue analyses in human SUDEP cases point to reductions in markers of the brainstem serotonin (5-HT) system, which is known as a brainstem center that provides excitatory neuromodulation. We have previously shown in a knockout rat model (SSkcnj16-/- rats) that repeated seizures led to progressively greater ventilatory inhibition in the post-seizure period, seizure-associated mortality, and reduced brainstem 5-HT and tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph) particularly within the Raphe Magnus (RMg).

Unbiased cluster analysis identified 18 cell major clusters that were by identified by the expression of known gene markers, with most cells being oligodendrocytes.

Non-invasive manipulation of memory-related brain regions, specifically deeper temporal lobe regions, has been limited by the lack of precision of non-invasive neuromodulation; when targeting deeper structures, the cortex is always stimulated, never deeper structures in isolation. Temporal Interference (TI) stimulation, a novel non-invasive technique, uses high-frequency carrier fields to deliver targeted, physiologically relevant neuromodulation via amplitude-modulated envelopes at specific brain regions. Here, we investigate TI s impact on figure memory encoding in 70 healthy participants using the Rey-Osterrieth and Taylor Complex Figure tasks, with TI applied in several brain regions independently and simultaneously; allowing investigation of combinations of medial temporal lobe and neocortical brain regions. Interestingly, higher frequency TI envelopes (130 Hz offset) targeting bilateral hippocampi and temporal cortices significantly impair recall (p = 6.54e-04), while lower frequency TI envelopes (5 Hz offset) targeting only the bilateral hippocampi significantly enhance recall (p = 0.0447). Stimulation using other combinations of medial temporal lobe and neocortical regions showed no effect, underscoring the critical role of frequency and focality of non-invasive brain stimulation and correct target selection. Finally, functional MRI reveals strong differences between the effects of 130 Hz and 5 Hz envelopes, specifically in hippocampal BOLD signals, brain connectivity, default mode, and attentional networks.

In the cerebral cortex, sensory gating has been demonstrated in primary (S1) and higher-order sensory areas. The primary motor cortex (M1) is the major cortical output relay to the spinal cord and muscles, and proprioceptive feedback is crucial for shaping motor output, much as in S1. However, whether proprioceptive signals to M1 are attenuated during movement, and if so, why, remains unclear. We recorded somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) in M1 of two monkeys performing a wrist task while electrically stimulating muscle and cutaneous afferents innervating forearm extensors and adjacent skin. Both local field potentials and single-neuron recordings revealed significant suppression of muscle-evoked SEPs during Active movement and Static hold phases, providing direct evidence that proprioceptive input to M1 is generally gated during motor execution, as previously reported for cutaneous input. Yet, amidst this suppression, SEPs in a subset of M1 neurons were preserved during Static hold, especially those evoked by antagonist muscle afferents. Because monkeys had to maintain precise joint angles for stable posture, these results suggest that proprioceptive signals from antagonist muscles - likely reflecting spindle activity in lengthening muscles - escape attenuation to provide information essential for joint angle control. Overall, our findings demonstrate that while proprioceptive input to M1 is broadly suppressed during motor output, specific afferent signals from antagonist muscles are selectively maintained in a context-dependent manner to support posture control.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that sequencing depth significantly impacts downstream analysis, with deeper sequencing yielding more detected cells and features, improved data integration, refined clustering and annotation, and more accurate scientific interpretations. We identified nine major cell types, defined their molecular signatures, and mapped cis-regulatory landscapes. Integration of gene expression with chromatin accessibility enabled peak-gene association and transcriptional network analyses, revealing transcription factors, their target genes, and their regulatory elements. This approach uncovered cell types, genes, and cis-regulatory regions potentially driving pain conditions. Our unbiased genome-wide analysis confirmed known pain-related genes and highlighted novel candidates. These findings provide new insight into molecular mechanisms and candidate cell types involved in pain. Importantly, our results demonstrate that non-neuronal cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and SGCs, play critical roles in pain pathogenesis and should be investigated as therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have demonstrated that alpha-syn can be transmitted from neuron to neuron via exosomal release, thereby contributing to the propagation of alpha-syn pathology. However, the mechanism by which alpha-syn-containing exosomes perturb the function of recipient neurons is currently unknown. Retrograde axonal transport of carriers emanating from the presynapse is essential for neuronal survival. To determine the effect of transmitted alpha-syn on neuronal retrograde trafficking, we used conditioned medium from alpha-syn transfected donor hippocampal neurons, applied to naive (non-transfected) recipient neurons cultured in microfluidic chambers. Time-lapse imaging of retrograde carriers containing cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) was then performed in these recipient neurons. Here, we show that conditioned medium from alpha-synWT-GFP transfected donor neurons significantly downregulated the frequency of retrograde CTB carriers when applied to recipient neurons. This effect was abolished by (i) inhibiting endocytosis in recipient neurons, (ii) blocking exosomal release from donor cells via an Hsp90-dependent mechanism, or (iii) by using conditioned medium from neurons transfected with a Parkinson's mutant (alpha-synA30P-GFP). Whilst transmitted, alpha-synWT-mEos2, alpha-synA30P-mEos2, and mEos2 alone were detected in recipient neurons using single-molecule imaging. Interestingly, alpha-synWT-mEos2 exhibited lower mobility and periodic (190 nm) immobilizations along the axon. Our data suggest that the downregulation of vesicular trafficking by transmitted alpha-syn does not rely on the specific release nor uptake of exosomal alpha-syn but probably depends on its interaction with endogenous alpha-syn following endocytosis in recipient neurons. The transmitted alpha-syn-containing extracellular vesicles therefore control essential axonal trafficking in recipient neurons, an effect lost with the Parkinson's disease mutant alpha-synA30P.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

R.; Gao, C.-F.; Wu, S.-F.", "abstract": "Successful reproduction requires precise coordination of muscle contractions during ovulation and has been well investigated in insects. However, the neural mechanisms of the central pattern generator (CPG) orchestrating this process remain poorly understood. Using Drosophila, we identify a novel pair of multidendritic mechanosensory neurons (mdn-LO) in the lateral oviducts that express the mechanosensitive channels TMC (transmembrane channel-like protein), PPK (pickpocket), and Piezo. We demonstrate that TMC is essential for ovulation coordination: tmc mutation or neuron-specific knockdown significantly increases egg-jamming at the junction between the lateral and the common oviduct, while ppk or Piezo single mutants reduce egg-laying without causing jamming. Calcium imaging reveals that mdn-LO neurons are rhythmically activated by oviduct contractions, and chemogenetic stimulation of these neurons triggers muscle contraction. Trans-Tango and GRASP (GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners) analyses show that mdn-LO neurons form synapses with efferent insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7)-expressing motor neurons in the abdominal ganglion. Activating either mdn-LO or ILP7 neurons induces egg-jamming, indicating their roles within a CPG network. This circuit, including the TMC-expressing mdn-LO neurons and a set of ILP7 neurons, organizes an innate behavior by coupling strategic sensory information and a CPG to ensure bilateral coordination of oviduct contractions to prevent egg jamming during oviposition.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

C.; Zhang, M.; Moon, B. K.; Ji, L.; Makriyannis, A.; Suh, J.", "abstract": "Rationale. The cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) signaling pathway plays a central role in regulating motivational and feeding behaviors. Neutral CB1R antagonists represent a promising therapeutic class with potentially fewer adverse effects than inverse agonists, yet their behavioral effects remain incompletely characterized. Objectives. We investigated the behavioral profile of AM6527, orally bioavailable neutral CB1R antagonist, across naturalistic and operant paradigms in male mice. To evaluate dopaminergic involvement in AM6527s effects, we employed several pharmacological interventions. Results. Using machine learning-based Motion-Sequencing (MoSeq), which parses spontaneous behavior into sub-second syllables, we found that AM6527 did not affect overall speed in an open field, however, it increased the self-directed behaviors and reduced specific locomotor syllables at the highest dose tested. In a naturalistic reward consumption paradigm, AM6527 produced a dose-dependent reduction in milk intake. Operant conditioning paradigms revealed robust suppression of motivated responding on fixed ratio-3 and progressive ratio (PR) schedules for palatable milk reward, with the greatest impact on high-baseline performers under PR conditions. To understand the dopaminergic involvement, we co-administered dopaminergic drugs (targeting D1R, D2R, or dopamine transporter) which resulted in partial rescue of operant responding, indicating dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic contributions to AM6527s observed behavioral effects. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that neutral CB1R antagonism suppresses consummatory and motivated behaviors via dopamine-dependent and -independent mechanisms. By leveraging sub-second behavioral analysis with MoSeq, we further reveal distinct changes in spontaneous behavior, underscoring the relevance of CB-based treatments for maladaptive appetitive and motivational states in both psychiatric and metabolic disorder.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Our objective was to investigate the influence of nutritional vitamin E and plant extracts on redox and immune status at the systemic and local mammary levels during an inflammatory challenge in dairy cows. Thirty-six Holstein cows were placed in three groups: a 'control' group (n = 11) unsupplemented; a 'vitamin E' group (n = 13), supplemented with 3000 IU/d for 4 weeks before calving and 1000 IU/d for 4 weeks after calving; and a 'plant extracts' group (n = 14) supplemented with 10 g/d for 4 weeks before and after calving. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli was infused into a one-udder quarter of the cows 5 weeks after calving. Blood and milk samples were collected before and 4, 7, 9, 28, and 76 h after the LPS infusion. Results: In the plant extract group, antioxidant gene (NQO1), superoxide dismutase activity 4 hours after the LPS challenge and total antioxidant capacity were increased compared to the control group. In the vitamin E group, expression of the antioxidant gene (SOD3) and glutathione peroxidase activity were more elevated than in the control group. Systemic immunity appeared to be reduced by antioxidant supplementations, with a higher migration of classical neutrophils in the plant extract group and less ROS production of neutrophils in the vitamin E group. However, immune capacities were increased at the local level in classical neutrophils (ROS production and phagocytosis) in both the plant extract and vitamin E groups. Following the LPS infusion, supplementation did not reveal any differences in terms of rectal temperature, milk yield or milk cell counts, but it did have a positive effect on mammary epithelium integrity (lower milk Na+:K+ ratio and higher OCLN gene expression). In addition, the plant extracts stimulated the synthesis of milk constituents, with higher milk protein gene expressions (LALBA, CSN3, CSN1S1) and a tendency towards a higher lactose content in milk. Conclusion: The LPS challenge showed that vitamin E or plant extracts enhanced the local inflammatory response while preserving systemic antioxidant capacities, integrity of the mammary gland and the composition of milk, and thus possibly contributing to preventing mammary infection in early lactating dairy cows.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

However, how methyltransferases maintain CG methylation within compact chromatin, including centromeres, remains unclear. In humans, CDCA7 is necessary for the inheritance of DNA methylation at juxta-centromeres. Mutations that impair its ability to bind chromatin result in Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability, and Facial Anomalies (ICF) syndrome, characterized by centromeric instability. To investigate whether CDCA7 function is conserved, we identified two Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs, CDCA7A and CDCA7B. The loss of both copies results in CG hypomethylation at pericentromeric regions and centromeric satellite repeat arrays. Machine learning analysis suggested that heterochromatic nucleosomes, with enrichment of H1, H2A.W, and H3K9me2 levels, depend heavily on CDCA7 proteins for CG methylation maintenance of the associated DNA. Loss of H1 restores heterochromatic DNA methylation in cdca7a cdca7b mutants, indicating that CDCA7A and CDCA7B mainly remodel H1-containing nucleosomes for methyltransferases to access DNA. Notably, in h1.1 h1.2 mutants, CG methylation shows a significant increase in centromeres, which reveals a new inhibitory role of H1 in DNA methylation maintenance within satellite repeat arrays. Centromeric DNA hypermethylation is lost in h1.1 h1.2 cdca7a cdca7b quadruple mutants, demonstrating that CDCA7A and CDCA7B can act independently of H1 to enhance MET1 activity. Overall, these findings establish CDCA7A and CDCA7B as conserved regulators of DNA methylation within heterochromatin and centromeric satellite repeat arrays.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aimed to analyze the impact of JQ1, an inhibitor of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, which are key readers of the epigenetic acetylation code, on AD-related gene expression changes and biochemical alterations in the hippocampus during a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammatory response in mice. Methods JQ1 and LPS were administered intraperitoneally to adult male wild-type C57BL/6J mice. Changes in selected general and brain-specific parameters were measured for up to 12 h. Results Our results demonstrated that inhibition of BET proteins reduced LPS-induced sickness behavior and time-dependent elevation of proinflammatory signaling. LPS did not significantly alter amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) levels; however, a significant reduction in A{beta} load was observed in JQ1-treated animals overall, suggesting that BET proteins play a crucial role in regulating A{beta} levels in the brain. At the same time, JQ1 treatment did not affect LPS-induced increases in phospho-Tau levels. Discussion Our results suggest that inhibiting BET proteins, in addition to their anti-inflammatory action, may be an effective strategy for reducing A{beta} levels in the brain.

A.; Vazirabad, I.; Rhode, N.; Mouradian, G.; Manis, A.; Hodges, M. R.", "abstract": "Epilepsy affects millions worldwide, but a significant portion suffers from uncontrollable epilepsy. Repeated seizures have many consequences, including a high risk of post-ictal cardiorespiratory failure and Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). Major risk factors for SUDEP include biological sex in addition to the occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs). How repeated seizures lead to cardiorespiratory dysfunction remains unknown. A key factor in many neurological diseases is neuroinflammation, predominantly mediated by microglia and astrocytes that become dysfunctional. Mechanistically, questions remain how they affect neuronal function in epilepsy and contribute to cardiorespiratory dysfunction and increased SUDEP risk. Previously, we have shown that repeated seizures in our novel rat model with genetic mutations in kcnj16, an inwardly rectifying K+ channel, in the Dahl salt sensitive rat (SSkcnj16-/-) led to increased neuroinflammation in key ventilatory regions at 3 and 5 days of seizures. Specifically, there was increased recruitment of various inflammatory mediators, increased recruitment of activated microglia, with improvement in post-ictal respiratory dysfunction and mortality with usage of anti-inflammatory agents. Here we tested the hypothesis that repeated seizures lead to differential neuroinflammatory activation after repeated seizures in CNS regions of ventilatory control. Male SSkcnj16-/- rats were subjected to 0 (Naive), 3, 7 or 10 days of seizure, and subsequently, the pre-B&oumltzinger Complex/Nucleus Ambiguus (preB&oumltC/NA) was isolated and sent for nuclei isolation and sequencing. Seurat was utilized to filter and process the data, integrate across conditions and allow for differential gene expression (DEG) analysis. Afterwards, pathways enrichment analysis was performed allowing for determination of unique pathways recruited across cell types for each seizure condition. Overall, we were able to identify 18 unique cell types based on transcriptomic signatures, with 8 different neuronal populations, grouped based on Type 1, Type 2 or a mixed Type 1 & Type 2 genetic expression, indicating rhythm generation or pattern generation, respectively. We found that majority of the neuronal clusters were Type 1 or mixed type, indicating predominantly rhythmogenic neuronal populations. Importantly, these critical neuronal populations showed significant upregulation in various metabolic and neurological disease pathways at the 3 and 7 Day timepoints. Furthermore, we identified various glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes and saw increased recruitment in various Inflammatory pathways, Metabolic pathways and Chemokine related pathways after 3 and 7Days of seizures, confirming our previous results. Consequently, our results show for the first time, transcriptomic characterization of crucial rhythmogenic neuronal populations after repeated seizures and the changes that may underlie their dysfunction in SUDEP, mediated in part through the network change in upregulated inflammatory pathways in surrounding glial cells.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Normal aging is associated with a reduction in the functional capacity of OPCs and induces distinct transcriptional signatures even in the absence of an autoimmune inflammatory demyelination insult. To determine how aging impacts the OPC response to an acute inflammatory insult comparable to a demyelinating event in multiple sclerosis (MS), we performed adoptive transfer of young myelin-reactive Th17 T cells into young and aged mice. Spinal cord OPC responses were quantified using lineage tracing and myelin sheath thickness was quantified using transmission electron microscopy. In the subacute phase 9-10 days after adoptive transfer, the density of both young and aged OPCs is enriched in spinal cord lesions compared to non-lesion white matter. After adoptive transfer, the density of aged OPCs is significantly higher than naive/non-adoptive transfer aged spinal cord. Differentiated oligodendrocytes (OLs) are relatively preserved within lesions of aged and young animals despite an overall reduction in OL density after adoptive transfer. While lineage tracing identified newly formed oligodendrocytes after adoptive transfer in both young and aged lesions, less oligodendrocyte differentiation was observed in aged animals. Despite the reduction of OPC differentiation in aged animals, there was no significant difference in the extent of remyelination observed for young and aged lesions. Aged OPCs rise to the challenge in response to a strong auto-immune attack, suggesting that compensatory strategies allow both young and aged OPCs to survive and remyelinate in the inflammatory environment. Identifying pathways that promote resilience of young and aged OPCs in the face of an inflammatory challenge will facilitate the development of remyelinating therapies for the treatment of people with MS across the full spectrum of human aging.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Convergent synaptic motifs -- a tight grouping of at least two axons whose active zones are within 300nm and which are presynaptic to the same target -- are a common feature of neural circuits in the insect brain and are believed to serve as an important computational primitive in many brain areas. The Mushroom Body (MB) of Drosophila, for instance, is the center of associative learning and memory, where sensory information is conducted by Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the MB, and integrated by MB output neurons (MBONs). Indeed, the majority of KC-to-MBON synapses occur in a convergent motif. Nonetheless, the functional role of this convergent motif is not well studied. To gain insight into their potential role in the MB, we combine big-data network neuroscience tools with existing electron microscopy connectome datasets to detect and map the distribution of convergent synaptic motifs. We find that convergent motifs consistently occur across the MB in different individuals, including the  lobe where they were first quantified, and we report on both the variance and consistency in the formation of these motifs across different MB regions and individuals. Our discovery of multiply-convergent motifs -- where two KCs target multiple postsynaptic targets simultaneously -- reveals a previously unrecognized synaptic economy that may optimize information transfer while conserving neural resources. These stereotyped arrangements likely represent fundamental organizational principles underlying associative learning across species.

Using resting-state fMRI from 584 neonates in the Developing Human Connectome Project, we provide the first comprehensive systems-level characterization of human visual cortex within hours of birth and across the third trimester of gestation. We discover that newborns possess a sophisticated visual architecture already functionally organized into three distinct pathways (ventral, lateral, and dorsal), each exhibiting posterior-to-anterior hierarchical structure and adult-like topographic organization. This tripartite visual organization differs from the bipartite organization observed in macaques, suggesting this architecture emerges through intrinsic developmental mechanisms rather than being a product of extensive postnatal experience and environmental adaptation. Moreover, pathway segregation, hierarchical ordering, and connectivity maturity all strengthen progressively with gestational age, revealing that visual cortical organization emerges through an active developmental program that unfolds across late gestation. Yet, despite this large-scale structure, individual pathways follow strikingly different maturation trajectories: dorsal areas exhibit a near-adult-like functional organization, even at the earliest gestational timepoints tested, whereas ventral areas remain immature and poised for experience-dependent refinement. These findings reframe our understanding of early visual development by revealing that complex functional networks emerge before substantial visual experience, yet are differentially prepared for plasticity, providing crucial insights into how evolution has optimized the brain for rapid learning while maintaining the flexibility needed for adaptation to diverse environments.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Although pain states increase vulnerability to opioid use disorders, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction remain incompletely understood. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key site for opioid actions, and emerging evidence suggests that pain states and opioid experience both induce transcriptional, molecular, and circuit adaptations in the VTA that contribute to motivated behaviors. However, the transcriptional responses of distinct VTA cell types to each of these factors (alone or in combination) have not been identified. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively define transcriptional alterations in the rat VTA to acute morphine administration in a chronic inflammatory pain model. We report that morphine induces gene expression changes primarily in glial cells and dopamine neurons, with minimal effects in other neuronal cell types. Surprisingly, VTA astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibited the most robust transcriptional responses to opioid exposure, despite lacking detectable opioid receptor expression. Among the most highly regulated glial genes was Fkbp5, which encodes a co-chaperone protein that acts in concert with heat shock proteins to modulate stress responses. Using pharmacological and CRISPR-based approaches in rat glial cells and human astrocytes, we demonstrate that regulation of Fkbp5 is mediated indirectly through glucocorticoid signaling rather than direct opioid receptor activation. These findings reveal that glial cells within reward circuits undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in response to opioids through indirect, stress-hormone mediated mechanisms, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-neuronal contribution to opioid-induced neural adaptations.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Diffusion MRI provides a unique opportunity to probe biological processes non-invasively, as water displacements occur on the micrometer scale. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), our team showed that motor sequence learning (MSL) induces microstructural changes in the hippocampus and key motor regions, suggesting that declarative and procedural systems may operate as part of the same network. Yet DTI cannot identify the cellular source of these changes, leaving open whether they reflect structural plasticity, remodeling of dendritic and astrocytic processes described in rodents, or transient homeostatic responses that accompany learning, neuronal and astrocytic swelling. Here, we combined ultra-high-gradient diffusion MRI with the compartment-based Soma and Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI) model to disentangle the cellular basis of motor skill memory consolidation. DTI showed that MSL induced rapid microstructural changes in the hippocampus, precuneus, and motor regions, but only those in the precuneus and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) persisted overnight. SANDI revealed that DTI changes were driven by two distinct cellular processes: a transient enlargement of the cell soma across all regions consistent with a short-lived homeostatic response, and a sustained rise in cell-process density restricted to the precuneus and PPC, compatible with structural plasticity.

LRP5/6, arrow (arr) in Drosophila, is the obligate co-receptor in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, with ligand binding to a Frizzled (Fz) family member and LRP5/6 mediating formation of the signalosome complex with Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl in mammals) and Axin. Current models for Wnt/PCP signaling omit Arr/LRP5/6 and the notion is that it functions without these co-receptors. Here we show that arr/LRP5/6 is positively required in Wnt/PCP signaling. In Drosophila, loss of arr results in PCP mediated cellular orientation defects, aberrant wing hair formation, and loss of polarity, as described for core PCP factors fz, fmi/Celsr, and dsh. In the eye, arr mutant tissue displays cell fate changes in photoreceptors R3/R4 and chirality defects, classical PCP phenotypes. During Wnt/PCP establishment, defects are manifest as reduced levels of Fmi/Celsr and Dsh along with loss of their asymmetric localization. Functional interactions indicate that Fz can recruit Arr, and this potentiates Fz and Dsh function in PCP signaling in all tissues tested. Taken together, our data support an essential Arr/LRP5/6 function in promoting Wnt/Fz-Dsh PCP-complex activity.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

We apply RNAi methods to the marine polychaete Streblospio benedicti, which is a model system for studying evolutionary and developmental biology that currently has no established methods for gene expression manipulation. Results: Here we describe a RNAi gene knockdown methodology using two different approaches depending on developmental stage. We feed bacteria expressing dsRNA to early swimming larvae and microinject in vitro transcribed dsRNA in juveniles. We used two genes for testing: R-opsin and F-actin. For both developmental stages, gene knockdown was validated using qPCR (quantitative Real-Time PCR). For larvae, we also visualized reduction in RNA expression using Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) in situ hybridization. Conclusions: We show that both larval feeding and juvenile microinjections are sufficient delivery mechanisms for dsRNA to result in a RNAi gene knockdown. The efficiency can vary depending on the gene and timing, but this is typical for RNAi based approaches.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different. In contrast, blocked training produced the opposite effect: it improved performance and facilitated transfer across similar tasks.

Structure and function in both the hippocampus and cerebellum have been linked to mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimers Disease, and cognitive decline in healthy older adults. Literature on the CBHP circuit is largely limited to animal studies and small samples of young adults in the context of visuospatial abilities, underscoring the need for large, diverse aging cohorts to establish CB-HP connectivity as an early, translatable marker of neurodegeneration. Here, we investigate the CBHP circuit in the context of aging, dementia risk, behavior, and sex differences in healthy older adults to advance understanding of cognitive decline in the aging population. We explored this relationship in 857 healthy adults with and without a family history of dementia (aged 50-88, 59% female, 71% family history positive) using resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsMRI) and behavioral assessments. We hypothesized that CB-HP functional connectivity (FC) would be lower with increased age, relate positively to cognitive performance, be lower in females positive for family history of dementia, and be lower in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-risk than cognitively normal (CN) participants with sex differences therein. We observed selective links between CBHP FC, cognition, and sex. MCI risk participants performed worse on spatial memory performances than CN, whereas CBHP FC showed opposite performance slopes by risk status, suggesting the CBHP circuit may function as a compensatory network for short-term recall. Sex differences were seen on cognitive tasks (delayed episodic memory and spatial tasks) and in CBHP a better visuospatial index was linked to greater FC in females, while males displayed an inverse relationship. Behavioral differences by familial dementia history were shown, although CBHP FC did not show effects here. Overall, CB-HP networks appear behaviorally silent in the aggregate but reveal risk and sex dependent relationships when memory demands and circuit nodes are considered.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that clade Ib displays enhanced cell-to-cell dissemination in vitro compared to clade IIb. Additionally, using the CAST mouse model, we show that clade Ib retains a higher level of virulence than that of the markedly attenuated clade IIb. Clade Ib leads to significant weight loss and high mortality in animals following both intraperitoneal and intranasal challenge. Histopathological analysis revealed more severe and extensive lung lesions in clade Ib infected animals, accompanied by a broader distribution of viral antigens.

In the mouse visual cortex, excitatory neurons in layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) form such a continuum along cortical depth, patterned by the graded expression of hundreds of genes. Here we sought to understand how this continuum develops and contributes to cortical wiring. Using single-nucleus multiomics (RNA- and ATAC-Seq) and spatial transcriptomics, we show that the L2/3 continuum is established in two phases. During the first postnatal week, a genetically hardwired program establishes a primitive continuum of cell identities spanning the depth of L2/3. The second program, promoted by visual experience, is later superimposed upon the preexisting continuum. This second phase is driven by activity-regulated transcription factors that drive the L2/3 depth-dependent expression of genes linked to synaptic function and plasticity. We show that neurons at different positions along the L2/3 continuum project preferentially to distinct higher visual areas and that visual deprivation disrupts targeting to some higher visual areas while sparing others. Thus, cortical continua emerge through a stepwise process in which genetic programs and sensory experience specify neuronal identity and sculpt intracortical wiring specificity.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Using an in vitro reprogramming, differentiation and neural maturation protocol, we obtained highly purified populations of post-mitotic motor neurons for both normal and diseased cells. As expected, as fibroblasts are reprogrammed into iPSCs, and as iPSCs differentiate into motor neurons, chromatin accessibility, chromosome conformation, and nuclear organization change along with large-scale alterations in transcriptional profiles. We find that the transcriptome changes extensively during the first three weeks of post-mitotic neuronal maturation, with thousands of genes changing expression, but then is relatively stable for the next three weeks. In contrast, chromosome conformation and nuclear organization continue to change over the entire 6-week maturation period: chromosome territoriality increases, long-range interactions along chromosomes decrease, compartmentalization strength increases, and centromeres and telomeres increasingly cluster. In motor neurons derived from ALS patients such changes in chromosome conformation were much reduced. Chromatin accessibility changes also showed delayed maturation. The transcriptome in these cells matured relatively normally but with notable changes in expression of genes involved in lipid, sterol and mitochondrial function. We conclude that neural maturation is associated with large scale post-mitotic changes in gene expression, chromosome conformation and nuclear organization, and that these processes are defective in motor neurons derived from ALS patients carrying C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Less is known, however, of the changes in gene expression supporting the maintenance of memory, particularly when it remains undisturbed or offline days after the memory experience. In this study, we used a combination of spatial transcriptomic and single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to measure the gene expression changes in the dorsal hippocampus during an early phase of offline memory maintenance, 3 days after the post-training retention test of an active place avoidance memory. Through spatial transcriptomics we identified spatially regionalized differential gene expression and biological process enrichment, with CA1, CA3, and DG exhibiting differential expression of genes involved in post-synaptic function, synaptic vesicle transport, and neuronal differentiation, respectively. Notably, through snRNA-seq, differentially expressed genes detected in clusters of hippocampal neurons from the trained animal were largely defined by their down regulation of genes involved in ATP synthesis and cytoplasmic translation. With both techniques we also examined the gene expression changes in a putative subset of memory-associated neurons through the detection of eYFP mRNA in the Arc-Cre/flox-eYFP double transgenic mouse line. Amongst this population of cells, we detected a limited number of differentially expressed genes unique to each subregional population and associated with synaptic plasticity and post-synaptic signaling. Our results suggest that two overarching transcriptomic patters contribute to the functional changes in hippocampal cells during offline memory maintenance: a regional distribution of pathways linked to synaptic functions, and a reduction of metabolic activity across hippocampal sub-regions and memory-associated neuronal ensembles.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

However, the conditions and mechanisms that lead to the robust induction of respiratory IgA responses following mucosal vaccination remain poorly understood. It is also currently debatable whether mucosal vaccination is still warranted given that most individuals in developed countries have established a hybrid immunity from vaccination and infection. Here we characterized respiratory mucosal immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination or both in humans. We found that hybrid immunity resulted in moderately increased respiratory IgA and neutralizing antibody responses compared to infection or vaccination alone. However, a direct comparison of hybrid immunity and a mucosal adenovirus-based booster vaccination in animal models revealed that respiratory booster immunization elicited markedly stronger and more durable respiratory IgA, T cell response, and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, supporting the promise of respiratory mucosal vaccination. Mechanistically, we found that mucosal booster immunization induced local IgA-secreting cells in the respiratory mucosa, aided by pulmonary CD4+ T cells in situ. Strikingly, local IL-21-producing Blimp-1+ Th1 effector cells were critical in mediating the CD4+ T cell help for respiratory IgA production. Furthermore, lung macrophages were important for this respiratory IgA response via the production of TGF-{beta}. Consequently, we demonstrated delivery of adenoviral booster to the lower airway was necessary to generate robust upper and lower airway IgA responses. Collectively, our results uncover a local cellular network supporting enhanced respiratory IgA responses, with implications for the development of optimal mucosal immunization strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

We identify that genomic diversity does not correlate with isolation source or most virulence phenotypes. Instead, we find that the two major P. aeruginosa clades (Groups A and B) delineate phylogeny and cytotoxicity, with Group B strains showing significantly higher cytotoxicity than Group A. Sequence analysis revealed previously uncharacterized alleles of genes encoding type III secretion effector proteins. We observed high variability amongst strains and isolation sources in all four assayed virulence phenotypes. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is exclusively observed in clinical isolates, not environmental, reflecting antibiotic exposure-driven selection. Bacterial GWAS revealed a statistically significant association between cytotoxicity and exoU presence, and we identified a novel exoU allelic variant with decreased cytotoxicity, demonstrating that functional diversity within well-characterized virulence factors may still influence pathogenic outcomes.

Viral-derived DNA is preferentially found at distinct genomic loci suggesting a selective process driven by integration site-specific crosstalk between viral and host sequences. Focusing on one of the most prominent selected integration loci, the BTB Domain and CNC Homolog 2 (BACH2) gene, we here show evidence for exaptation of provirus-derived regulatory sequences leading to target cell reprogramming during long-term ART. Using a cellular model of BACH2-integrated proviruses, we find that proviral transcription drives aberrant BACH2 protein levels that escape autoregulatory feedback and impose BACH2-dependent transcriptomic changes. By mimicking these changes in primary CD4+ T lymphocytes, we observe that BACH2 drives reprogramming of cells toward a proliferative, precursor memory-like type. These reprogrammed CD4+ T cells possess traits of immune evasion and cellular survival that are signatures of HIV reservoir cells in PLWH. Inhibition of provirus transcriptional activity can mitigate exaptation, suggesting a strategy to offset HIV-driven differentiation and expansion of CD4+ T cells. Finally, our data suggest that provirus exaptation at the Signal Transducer And Activator of Transcription 5B (STAT5B) selected integration gene drives a contrary, effector-like T cell fate, suggesting a multifaceted impact of exaptation on immune homeostasis.

A central question, however, is how bacterial organelles are organized in the cell, and whether their spatial control can be engineered. Here, we show that a two-protein system (McdAB) that positions carboxysomes-CO2-fixing organelles found in autotrophic bacteria-can be repurposed to provide programmable spatial control to diverse organelles in Escherichia coli. McdAB not only restores proper assembly and positioning of heterologously expressed carboxysomes in E. coli, but can also be reprogrammed to spatially organize all other known types of bacterial organelles, including encapsulins, biomolecular condensates, and even membrane-bound organelles. Programmable spatial organization of bacterial organelles establishes a new design principle for synthetic biology, where the location of reactions is as tunable as their content.

These differences in soil moisture are generally associated with shifts in soil redox state from anoxic on the plain to oxic on the slope. In anoxic plain soils, soil organic carbon (SOC) may accumulate due to thermodynamic constraints on microbial activity. Here, we used shotgun metagenomics to examine how microbial diversity and functional potential varies across differing redox conditions on plain and slope soils in two catchments in the Swiss Alps. We complemented these analyses with soil physicochemical characteristics and information on the chemical composition of organic matter. Plain soils had higher SOC stocks and higher relative abundance of phenol compounds relative to slope soils, consistent with SOC preservation and preferential mineralisation of easily degradable organic compounds under anoxic conditions. Microbial communities in plain soils further exhibited greater taxonomic and functional diversity, including an increased potential for anaerobic respiration pathways. Genes for nitrate, iron, and sulfate reduction were linked to Chloroflexota, Acidobacteria, Desulfobacterota phyla, respectively. Based on NMDS correlations, electron accepting capacity, calcium content, and pH shaped microbial community composition. Slope soils, by contrast, supported less diverse microbial communities, determined mainly by electron donating capacity and clay content. Our work demonstrates how soil redox conditions and microbial functional potential shape carbon cycling across landscape positions in alpine riparean zones. This mechanistic understanding is critical to anticipate changes in carbon cycling in alpine ecosystems in a changing climate.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

However, the role of recipient cells in their acquisition has received little attention. Using the ruminant pathogens Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma bovis as minimal models, we combined genome-wide transposon mutagenesis with high-throughput mating assays to identify recipient factors required for ICE acquisition. The surface lipoprotein P48 emerged as the primary determinant of ICE uptake in both species. Structural and functional analyses revealed that P48 is the substrate-binding component of an ABC transporter with nucleoside-binding capacity. A single point mutation that abolished nucleoside binding drastically reduced ICE acquisition, demonstrating that P48-mediated nucleoside recognition is essential for conjugative transfer. However, ICE uptake did not require nucleoside transport, as inactivation of the transporter permease blocked nucleoside analog toxicity but not ICE invasion. Loss of P48 also triggered transcriptional activation of vestigial ICE genes, suggesting that surface recognition affects the intracellular state of the recipient. Remarkably, ICE transmission from recipient-derived donors was unaffected by P48 loss, underscoring its acquisition-specific role. Together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized, surface-exposed recipient factor critical for efficient ICE transfer in mycoplasmas and identify nucleotide binding as a central function in conjugation. By demonstrating that recipient-encoded functions can directly control ICE dissemination, this work challenges the donor-centric paradigm of bacterial conjugation and suggests new strategies to restrict horizontal gene flow in pathogenic and synthetic mycoplasmas.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

We describe the use of a Rhodobacter sphaeroides laboratory strain for expression of heterologous photosynthesis genes to demonstrate the feasibility of mining this resource, focusing on hot spring Chloroflexota gene sequences. Using a synthetic operon of genes, we produced a photochemically active complex of reaction center proteins in our biological system. We also present bioinformatic analyses of anoxygenic type II reaction center sequences from metagenomic samples collected from hot (42-90 degrees C) springs available through the JGI IMG database, to generate a resource of diverse se-quences that potentially are adapted to photosynthesis at such temperatures.

Six of these new cultures represent new species. Nonetheless, phylogenomic analyses revealed close genetic relationships with organisms from anoxic environments, indicating the absence of an evolutionary distinction. Comparative genomics exposed diverse though non-unique repertories of antioxidant (e.g. catalase, superoxide dismutase and desulfoferrodoxin), and desiccation-resistance genes (including genes for maintaining osmotic pressure and repair of cell wall and membrane), with Methanobacterium spp. possessing the lowest gene abundance and diversity for oxygen and desiccation tolerance. Nevertheless, the occurrence of a Class I methanogen such as Methanobacterium in arid soils challenges the notion that members of this class are less oxygen tolerant than Class II. Pangenome analysis further uncovered unique genes enriched in membrane-associated functions and potentially non-functional stress-related genes. Via a global metagenomic survey, we find that methanogens are underdetected in dryland soils, likely due to sequencing depth limitations.

These allelic genes are interspersed among longer stretches of highly conserved sequences with signatures of extensive recombination that would shuffle the allelic genes into a vast number of allelic haplotypes. Bacterial artificial chromosome clones derived from 3 independent clinical isolates (TB40/e (TB), TR and Merlin (ME)) display dramatic differences in the abundance of entry-mediating glycoproteins gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131, virion infectivity and efficiency of cell-free and cell-to-cell modes of spread. Of these, TB and ME are the most phenotypically different and share only 2 of the 17 allelic genes. A set of recombinant HCMV was generated by coinfecting cells with TB and ME and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses demonstrated complex crossover patterns. Most recombinants were either \"TB-like\" with much more gH/gL/gO than gH/gL/UL128-131, or \"ME-like\" with much more gH/gL/UL128-131. This correlated with a TB or ME UL128 sequence, consistent with a G/T polymorphism affecting UL128 pre-mRNA splicing. One recombinant had a gH/gL/gO:gH/gL/UL128-131 ratio of 0.8, suggesting genetic determinants beyond UL128. Virion infectivity correlated with TB versus ME-like glycoprotein display, but intragroup variability indicated additional factors and variability in spread efficiency and the contribution of cell-free and cell-to-cell spread modes indicated an influence of characteristics beyond virion infectivity.

We evaluated the expression of 11 candidate reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, RPL13A, PPIB, TBP, HPRT1, PPIA, SDHA, TUBB2A, UBC) in whole blood collected every 6 hours over 24 hours from 40 participants who underwent overnight respiratory polygraphy.

Their robustness was confirmed by personalized cosinor analysis of core clock genes (BMAL1, PER2, CRY1), showing that reliable normalization enables detection of circadian oscillations in clinical samples. While population-level analysis revealed no significant rhythmicity, individual profiles showed oscillations in 25 participants, independent of OSA severity.

F.; Jorgensen, J. E. M.; Simpson, E. J.; Rasmussen, J.; Kyhl, K.; Greenhaff, P. L.; Dela, F.; Larsen, S.; Prats, C.", "abstract": "Background: Primary carnitine deficiency (PCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a lack of functional carnitine transporters OCTN2 (Organic Cation/Carnitine Transporter 2), which has been linked to several cases of sudden death in young Faroese individuals. It causes low carnitine levels and can present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, skeletal and cardiac myopathy. Patients are treated with L-carnitine, and even while receiving treatment, skeletal muscle carnitine levels are only approximately 7% of normal. The regulation of the carnitine transporter, OCTN2, is not fully understood, but a combination of hypercarnitinaemia with hyperinsulinemia upregulates skeletal muscle carnitine uptake and OCTN2 mRNA expression. Objective: The question arises as to whether hyperinsulinemia increases the efficiency of L-carnitine supplementation in PCD. The present study investigates the regulatory mechanisms behind insulin-induced carnitine uptake, and whether the combination of hypercarnitinaemia and hyperinsulinaemia increases skeletal muscle carnitine levels in patients with PCD. In addition to our main goals, we also explored the measurement of whole-body fat oxidation at rest and during exercise. Method: Nine patients with PCD (homozygous for the c.95 A >G, pN32S mutation) and nine healthy controls matched to age and body mass index (BMI) participated in the study. A six-hour hyperinsulinemic clamp was supplemented with infusion of L-carnitine the last five hours. Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected before and after the clamp and carnitine content was measured. Furthermore, confocal microscopy was used to access regulation of OCTN2 and GLUT4 positive vesicles due to insulin stimulation and additionally whole body fat oxidation was measured with indirect calorimetry. Results: We found that the combination of hypercarnitinaemia with hyperinsulinemia did not increase skeletal muscle total carnitine levels significantly for neither patients with PCD [4.5 (SE 0.6) to 5.3 (SE 0.5) mmol/kg] (P= 0.28) nor controls [19.8 (SE 0.6) to 21.2 (SE 0.5) mmol /kg] (P= 0.053). The muscle carnitine profile showed that patients with PCD have low levels of total and free carnitine in skeletal muscle, but normal levels of acetylcarnitines corresponding to 60% of total carnitine (normal is ~16% of total muscle carnitine). The results from confocal microscopy indicate that insulin regulates skeletal muscle carnitine uptake by stimulating OCTN2 recruitment from intracellular storages to the plasma membrane. This regulatory mechanism is however impaired in patients with PCD. Furthermore, we found that PCD patients were more dependent on carbohydrates at rest. In regard to fat oxidation, no difference was found between PCD and control group during short-term exercise. Conclusions: The study indicates that insulin stimulates translocation of OCTN2 to the plasma membrane in healthy controls, a mechanism that seems to be impaired in patients with PCD. The combination of hypercarnitinaemia with hyperinsulinemia did not increase skeletal muscle total carnitine levels significantly (P= 0.28) in patients with PCD.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we observe that deletion of the Tgfb1, Tgfb2, and Tgfb3 genes (TGF{beta} ligands) from cardiomyocytes in the early developing heart results in cardiac dysfunction by 6 weeks of age with altered fibroblast activity and altered ECM content. Early postnatal hearts from Tgfb1/2/3 cardiomyocyte-deleted mice are dysmorphic and cardiac fibroblasts have incorrect activity and produce inappropriate ECM with reduced stiffness. Gene expression profiling of hearts from myocyte-specific Tgfb1/2/3 deleted mice reveal defects in both cardiomyocyte and fibroblast maturation with ectopic expression of multiple skeletal muscle-specific genes beginning at embryonic day 17.5 and progressing with age. However, cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of TGF{beta} receptors I/II encoding genes (Tgfbr1/2) or Smad2/3 encoding genes (Smad2/3) do not recapitulate this phenotype suggesting that TGF{beta} directly programs early heart fibroblast development that in turn specifies cardiomyocyte maturation. Importantly, Col1a2-/-;Col6a2-/- mice with defective cardiac ECM stiffness, mice lacking cardiomyocyte Itgb1 with reduced ECM load sensing, and Tcf21-/- embryos at E17.5 lacking cardiac fibroblasts each fail to generate the same pathologic ECM program with ectopic cardiomyocyte differentiation observed with Tgfb1/2/3 myocyte-specific deletion.

Stress-induced and cytoplasmic localization of PUS7 promote pseudouridine-incorporation into hundreds of mRNA targets.

PNA is a valuable tool in antisense technology with potential antibacterial applications. However, PNA cannot penetrate bacterial cells alone. To address this, we explored iron chelators - siderophores - as PNA carriers. Bacteria acquire iron through siderophores, which are transported via specific TonB-dependent receptors in the bacterial envelope. Previously, we demonstrated that a synthetic hydroxamate-type siderophore (SL) exploited this transport system to deliver PNA into bacterial cells, achieving a gene-silencing effect. However, this transport was limited to an Escherichia coli mutant with continuous iron uptake, and was not observed in wild-type E. coli. In this study, we developed a new synthetic siderophore (SGLY) with glycine spacers between modified ornithine residues for enhanced flexibility and iron-binding. We also synthesized marine siderophore analogs (MGLY and MALA) inspired by natural moanachelins. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, spectrophotometric assays, and molecular dynamics simulations, we confirmed iron binding. Growth recovery experiments showed SGLY recognition and internalization via the TonB-dependent transport system, likely using hydroxamate siderophore pathways. The MGLY and MALA siderophores showed lower growth promotion than SGLY, indicating less efficient internalization. Molecular docking revealed high affinity of SGLY for E. coli receptors involved in the uptake of hydroxamate siderophores.

To bridge this experimental gap, a wave of AI tools now predicts putative m5C sites in silico. However, most existing approaches prioritize architectural complexity while neglecting data quality, so their reported gains mainly reflect the artifacts inherited from noisy datasets. We inverted this paradigm by constructing a high-confidence, methyltransferase-specific catalog of m5C sites, removing artifacts that confound existing resources. Using this curated corpus, we trained (for the first time in a multiclass setting) three different models (Bi-GRU, CNN, Transformer) to distinguish writer-specific m5C sites from unmethylated cytosines. All AI models converged to similar, nearly optimal, performance (AUPRC > 0.97), and a biologically informed analysis revealed that most errors clustered in unmethylated sites mimicking true positives. By augmenting the training set with these hard-to-predict negatives, mined from millions of unmodified cytosines, the models were forced to exploit more nuanced features such as RNA secondary structure and subtle sequence cues, which sharply reduced transcriptome-wide false positive predictions, and predicted methylated transcripts exhibited strong concordance with known methyltransferase biology. Explainable AI techniques also showed that our AI models effectively capture how sequence mutations disrupt m5C sites, underscoring their potential to prioritize disease-relevant variants.

Types 4 and 7 frequently circulate in the United States and are major causes of respiratory disease. Infections can result in hospitalization and, in severe cases, death. Although a live wild-type-virus vaccine targeting these two types exists, its use is restricted to military personnel due to concerns about viral-shedding and the potential for genetic recombination. To overcome these limitations, we recently developed a virus-like particle (VLP) platform as an alternative vaccination strategy. These VLPs are stable, lack genomic material, and elicit a potent humoral immune response in mice, effectively neutralizing adenoviral infection. Here, we describe the cryo-EM structure of these VLPs at near atomic resolution. Structural insights are essential to ensure that the neutralizing antigens displayed on the VLPs accurately mimic those of the infectious virion, guide the design of particles with improved stability and efficacy, and enable engineering of VLPs with antigenic properties targeting multiple adenovirus types. The structure confirms that the key epitopes capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies are appropriately displayed for antibody recognition. It also reveals previously unobserved interactions critical for capsid maturation. The penton base adopts multiple conformations when interacting with hexons, and its proper positioning is necessary to facilitate hexon-pIIIa interactions that stabilize the capsid. A comparison of the VLP with immature and mature adenovirus structures shows that core-genome packaging strengthens interaction between cementing proteins pIIIa and pVIII and the hexon shell.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Y.", "abstract": "Living cells sense diverse molecules and synthesize complex compounds, but their responses are slow and context dependent, which makes precise control difficult. Electronic systems excel at fast computation, communication, and control, but their direct access to biochemistry is limited. These two classes can be integrated through optogenetics to form cell-silicon systems for sensing and biomanufacturing. However, prototyping these systems remains nontrivial: current tools either pair high-accuracy sensing with robotic sample transfer that requires extensive setup, or avoid transfers by using custom sensors with limited accuracy and dynamic range that compromise performance. Here we present LEMOS, a low-cost LED-embedded microplate that operates inside a commercial microplate reader, keeping cultures in the reader for the entire experiment while syn-chronizing illumination with measurement. Using LEMOS and a growth-aware multiscale model, we rapidly executed the design-build-test-learn cycle to diagnose and correct closed-loop over-shoot in gene-expression setpoint tracking. We demonstrate closed-loop gene-expression control in batch culture within a standard plate reader and show that growth state is a key design variable for controller choice and tuning. By combining accessible hardware with a predictive model, LEMOS lowers the barrier to model-informed DBTL, shortens iteration, and provides a path to portable control strategies that extend to other hosts and optogenetic systems.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Introductory university physics courses often face the dual challenge of introducing students to new physics concepts while also addressing their preconceived notions that conflict with scientific principles. Active learning pedagogical approaches, which employ constructivist principles and emphasize active participation in the learning process, have been shown to be effective in teaching complex physics concepts. However, while the behavioral effects of constructivist methodologies are largely understood, the neurobiological underpinnings that facilitate this process remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assessed students enrolled in either an active learning or lecture-based physics course before and after a 15-week semester of learning and examined changes in hippocampal whole-brain connectivity. We focused on the hippocampus given its critical role in learning and memory. Our findings revealed that hippocampal connectivity with brain regions in the frontal and parietal lobes decreased over time, regardless of instructional approach. Results also indicated that active learning students exhibited increased hippocampal connectivity with parietal, cerebellar, and frontal regions, reflecting experiential learning based on constructivist principles, whereas lecture-based students exhibited increased hippocampal connectivity with the fusiform gyrus, suggesting learning through passive observation. Our findings demonstrate that while some aspects of hippocampal functional connectivity may decrease over time, active vs. passive learning may preferentially enhance hippocampal connectivity during physics learning.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

We report that 4-fluorouridine (4-FlU) inhibits the in vitro replication of epidemic and pre-epidemic OROV strains in multiple cell lines. 4-FlU is known to inhibit the replication of various RNA viruses by targeting -as its 5-triphospate- viral polymerases. Following 24 days of consecutive in vitro passages of OROV in the presence of suboptimal concentrations of 4-FlU, no viral variants with drug associated mutations were identified in the viral polymerase. Analysis of high-confidence structural models of the OROV polymerase in complex with a template-primer RNA and incoming nucleotides provides a structural rationale for the relatively high barrier to resistance. In a stringent, acute OROV-infection model in AG129 mice, oral administration of 4-FlU completely blocked viral replication and virus-induced disease, also when administration was delayed until 72 hours after infection. Our findings support exploring the potential of 4-FlU for the management of OROV infections in humans.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

O.; Lacy, B.", "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection is associated with the production of two large toxins, TcdA and TcdB. The toxins are encoded in a pathogenicity locus along with a phage-like holin protein, TcdE, the remnants of a phage endolysin, TcdL, and a positive transcriptional regulator, TcdR. Previous studies investigating the mechanism of toxin secretion from the bacterium have yielded disparate results as to whether the bacteria undergo lysis and whether TcdE is required. Here, we demonstrate that TcdE and TcdA are only expressed in a small subset of cells in culture. The cells with high TcdE and TcdA expression show disrupted membranes, consistent with a form of bacterial lysis. The artificial overexpression of TcdE and TcdA through TcdR induction promotes tcdE-dependent bacterial lysis and cell death, even in 630{triangleup}erm, a strain previously thought to have tcdE-independent toxin secretion. We propose a general mechanism where a minority subpopulation undergoes TcdE-mediated lysis to release toxins, reconciling studies with differences stemming from strain variability and population-level assays.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "The global rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has outpaced the development of new antibiotics, prompting the urgent need for alternative treatment strategies. One such approach is to leverage collateral sensitivity (CS), where resistance to one antibiotic increases susceptibility to another. However, the clinical implementation of CS-based therapies depends on the consistency of these responses, which is challenged by variable resistance mutations and the dynamics of resistant strains during infection. Here, we combined experiments and mathematical models to assess the consistency and consequences of CS responses in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae following the de novo acquisition of resistance to five commonly used antibiotics. We found that many collateral responses were unpredictable and inconsistent between different resistance mutations. However, for two antibiotic pairs, we identified consistent unidirectional (RIF [-&gt;] FUS) and bidirectional (LNZ {leftrightarrow} FUS) CS interactions, despite the divergent evolutionary trajectories of resistant strains, as revealed by whole-genome sequencing. To evaluate if CS for these combinations can be exploited to design dosing strategies to eradicate S. pneumoniae infections while suppressing resistance, we developed a mathematical stochastic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model, which integrated our experimentally derived PD parameters with existing clinical PK models. Our model-based analyses confirmed the superiority of these antibiotic combinations over monotherapy and showed that their efficacy depends on the presence of CS interactions between the administered antibiotics. In summary, our study demonstrates how consistent CS interactions can be leveraged to inform treatment strategies, laying the groundwork for CS-guided therapies to preserve antibiotic efficacy.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 to generate non-activatable Ampk knock-in (KI) mice with mutation of threonine 172 phosphorylation site to alanine, circumventing the limitations of previous genetic interventions that disrupt the protein stoichiometry. KI mice of Ampk2, but not Ampk1, demonstrated phenotypic changes with increased fat-to-lean mass, impaired endurance exercise capacity, and diminished mitochondrial maximal respiration and conductance in skeletal muscle. Integrated temporal multi-omic analysis (proteomics/phosphoproteomics/metabolomics) in skeletal muscle at rest and during exercise establishes a pleiotropic yet imperative role of Ampk2 T172 activation for glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and contractile function. Importantly, there is a significant overlap of skeletal muscle proteomic changes in Ampk2 T172A KI mice with that of type 2 diabetic patients. Our findings suggest that Ampk2 T172 activation is critical for exercise performance and energy transduction in skeletal muscle and may serve as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Mutations in Fks1 confer caspofungin resistance by disrupting its interaction with the drug, thereby reducing inhibition of Fks1 enzymatic activity. Previous studies demonstrated that translation of the FKS1 mRNA was highly dependent on the translation initiation helicases eIF4A and Ded1 (1). Therefore, we investigated whether treatment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with the eIF4A inhibitor Rocaglamide A (RocA) or mutation of Ded1 affects translation of FKS1 and susceptibility to caspofungin. Using WT and temperature-sensitive ded1-ts strains, we demonstrated that RocA enhanced caspofungin-mediated growth inhibition and translation repression. Sensitivity to both drugs was further enhanced in ded1-ts strains, suggesting specifically targeting Ded1 in fungi could be an effective mechanism to prevent caspofungin resistance. We extended the analysis to Candida glabrata, a related fungal pathogen, and found similar results. Importantly, combining RocA with caspofungin was fungicidal in both species, suggesting the combination could decrease development of caspofungin resistance in pathogenic yeasts. Together these findings highlight the potential of targeting translation initiation helicases for effective combination antifungal treatments.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}

Without new agents to treat antibiotic resistant bacterial infections, mortality rates are predicted to reach 10 million people per year by 2050.

We are amid a natural product renaissance fuelled by inexpensive access to genome sequencing and sophisticated bioinformatic tools, which have highlighted that most of the biosynthetic pathways for NPs are not expressed in the laboratory. Here, we engineered the expression of a silent biosynthetic gene cluster harboured by an environmental isolate of Streptomyces albidoflavus. By using a bioinformatics-guided approach, we isolated and structurally characterised a novel glycopeptide antibiotic (GPA) named biffamycin A, which is the smallest GPA known and harbours unprecedented 5-chloro-4-methoxy tryptophan and 3-hydroxy(-[x1D05]-mannoysl)-[x1D05]-lysine moieties.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, critical components like the TATA-binding protein tbp-1 play pivotal roles in orchestrating chromatin dynamics. While the function of many of the interacting partners of tbp-1 is well-understood, our study brings into focus a lesser-known entity, T13F2.2, an unexplored tbp-1 interacting protein and a putative RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivator. Employing reverse genetics, we found that RNAi-induced depletion of T13F2.2 resulted in pronounced disruptions to nuclear architecture, evidenced by nuclear staining and transmission electron microscopy. Accompanying these structural anomalies, we observed increased autophagy, pointing to cellular stress and a hyperacetylation of the core histones, suggesting potential chromatin decompaction. Notably, multifaceted functional alterations, upon the partial knockdown of the T13F2.2, culminated in a substantial reduction in the worm's lifespan. Intriguingly, interventions such as administering ROS scavengers and autophagy modulators offered a reprieve from this life-shortening effect. Transcriptomic analysis upon T13F2.2 knockdown revealed upregulation of genes related to autophagy and chromatin remodelling, alongside downregulation of genes involved in longevity pathways and oxidative stress response. This study, thus, not only puts forward the functional implication of an uncharacterized gene in C. elegans biology, but also further emphasizes the role of chromatin organization in aging at the organismal level.", "date": "2025-09-22", "journal": ""}
