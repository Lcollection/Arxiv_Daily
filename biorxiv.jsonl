To systematically define the transcription factors (TFs) driving these states, we built a comprehensive atlas integrating transcriptional and epigenetic data across nine CD8+ T cell states and inferred TF activity profiles. Our analysis catalogued TF activity fingerprints, uncovering regulatory mechanisms governing selective cell state differentiation. Leveraging this platform, we focused on two transcriptionally similar but functionally opposing states critical in tumor and viral contexts: terminally exhausted T cells (TEXterm), which are dysfunctional, and tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM), which are protective. Global TF community analysis revealed distinct biological pathways and TF-driven networks underlying protective versus dysfunctional states. Through in vivo CRISPR screening integrated with single-cell RNA sequencing (in vivo Perturb-seq), we delineated that TFs selectively govern TEXterm. We identified HIC1 and GFI1 as shared regulators of TEXterm and TRM differentiation and KLF6 as a unique regulator of TRM. Importantly, we discovered novel TEXterm single-state TFs, including ZSCAN20 and JDP2 with no prior known function in T cells. Targeted deletion of these TFs enhanced tumor control and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade. Consistently, their depletion in human T cells reduces the expression of inhibitory receptors and improves effector function. By decoupling exhaustion-selective from protective TRM programs, our platform enables more precise engineering of T cell states, advancing rational design of effective immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Efficient migration is critical for antitumoral T cells to locate and eliminate cancer cells. To investigate the upper limits of cell speed, we developed a hybrid stochastic-mean field model of bleb-based cell motility. Our model suggests that cell-matrix adhesion-free bleb-based migration is highly inefficient, challenging the feasibility of cell swimming/adhesion-independent migration as a primary fast motility mode. Instead, we show that T cells can achieve rapid migration by combining bleb formation with adhesion-based forces. Supporting our predictions, our three-dimensional gel experiments confirm that T cells migrate significantly faster under adherent conditions than in adhesion-free environments. These findings highlight the mechanical constraints of T cell motility and suggest that modifying tissue adhesion properties in a controlled manner could enhance immune cell infiltration into tumors. Our computational and experimental work provides insights for optimizing T cell-based immunotherapies. While antifibrotic treatments could alter the tumor microenvironment, indiscriminate reduction of adhesion may not be ideal for T cell infiltration and motility, highlighting the need for targeted antifibrotic strategies", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Studies have shown that infants, members of isolated Stone Age tribes, and non-human primates can readily identify objects from line drawings. These findings suggest that the brain may inherently generate neural representations that align across different rendering cues, enabling abstraction. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the representational invariance of complex patterns of surface boundaries found in natural scenes. We tested whether individual neurons in V1 and V2 of the macaque monkey responded similarly to the presentation of these patterns across different renderings (i.e., as contours, luminance-defined patches, and segments of natural images). We found that individual neurons exhibit some degree of tuning invariance, stronger in V1 than in V2. At the population level, as a means to assess cue-invariant abstract representation, we measured decoding accuracy across cues ('cue-transfer' decoding). We found that this decoding is greatly enhanced when a geometric transformation (Procrustes Transformation) is first performed to align the population activities across cues. It is also effective when applied to different populations of neurons within or across visual areas. These results were compared with populations of artificial neurons from models of the ventral visual streams, further indicating that cue-invariance stabilizes with population size. In summary, we found that while individual neurons exhibit some cue-invariance properties, the stability of the population geometry emerges as a more robust candidate for supporting a cue-invariant representation of visual information in the early visual areas.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "During development, neural circuits are shaped continuously as we learn to control our bodies. The ultimate goal of this process is to produce neural dynamics that enable the rich repertoire of behaviors we perform. What begins as a series of \"babbles\" coalesces into skilled motor output as the brain rapidly learns to control the body. However, the nature of the teaching signal underlying this normative learning process remains elusive. Here, we test two well-established and biologically plausible theories--supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL)--that could explain how neural circuits develop the capacity for skilled movements. We trained recurrent neural networks to control a biomechanical model of a primate arm using either SL or RL and compared the resulting neural dynamics to populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex of monkeys performing the same movements. Intriguingly, only RL-trained networks produced neural activity that matched their biological counterparts in terms of both the geometry and dynamics of population activity. We show that this similarity with biological brains depends critically on matching biomechanical properties of the limb. Dynamical analysis on network activity revealed that our RL-trained networks operate at the \"edge of chaos\", a dynamical regime known for its computational richness, greater memory capacity, and robust plasticity properties. We then demonstrated that monkeys and RL-trained networks, but not SL-trained networks, show a strikingly similar capacity for robust short-term behavioral adaptation to a movement perturbation, indicating a fundamental and general commonality in the neural control policy. Together, our results support the hypothesis that neural dynamics for behavioral control emerge through a process akin to reinforcement learning. The resulting neural circuits offer numerous advantages for adaptable behavioral control over simpler and more efficient learning rules and expand our understanding of how developmental processes shape neural dynamics.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

VMP1-EV secretion decreased with mTOR inhibition and in Atg5-deficient cells. In pancreatic acinar cells, endogenous VMP1 secretion increased under stress, including blocked autophagic flux and experimental pancreatitis.

Any deviations from this pattern of state transitions indicates abnormal gating that has implications in conditions such as schizophrenia. Although dopamine is reported to modulate ion channels of MSN sub-types - dMSN and iMSN - its influence on the state transition times and up-state dwell times are not yet examined. We address this lacuna using biophysically constrained spiny models of dMSN and iMSN with explicit dopamine receptors.

Dopamine acting as a reward prediction error (RPE) signal causes experience-dependent synaptic changes in dMSN and iMSN, thereby shifting the dominance of neural activity to approach or avoidance signaling. These changes create bias in the striatal neuronal ensemble and restrict the choice to approach or avoidance in further iterations. However, organisms often exhibit behaviour where they choose undesirable or exploratory actions in anticipation of future reward or avoid desirable actions in anticipation of future risk. These against-bias decisions or exploratory decisions are not accounted for by the existing neuronal framework. To bridge this gap, we postulate that transient 'motivational' dopamine released from dopaminergic axons locally at sub-second timescales can cause temporary switch in dominance of neural activity between dMSN and iMSN leading to such adaptive decisions. By accounting for bias towards approach or avoidance or neither through synaptic weightages and accounting for differential affinity of DA to D1R and D2R, changes in dMSN and iMSN excitability at different levels of motivational dopamine was analyzed. Furthermore, the spiking activity of striatal neuronal ensemble comprising of dMSN projecting directly and iMSN projecting indirectly onto the output nuclei of basal ganglia i.e. SNr neurons was simulated. This led to promising findings that demonstrate how SNr neuronal activity can generate outcomes that work against the synaptic bias towards approach or avoidance.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Combining cell culture with three-dimensional vertex modeling, we demonstrate that epithelial stratification is analogous to a structural phase transition driven by the nucleation-growth process, i.e., multilayer origins dispersedly appear and expand across the epithelium via unordered intermediate states. This transition is induced by a mechanical instability inherent in the foam-like geometry of the epithelium. Moreover, the nucleation-growth concept applies to embryonic skin development and intestinal cancer transformation.

In this study, we explore how the absence of visual input alters tactile neural encoding in the rat somatosensory cortex (S1). Rats were trained on a custom-designed treadmill with distinct tactile textures (rough and smooth), and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from S1 under light and dark conditions. Machine learning techniques, specifically a convolutional neural network, were used to decode the high-dimensional LFP signals. We found that the neural representations of tactile stimuli became more distinct in the dark, indicating a reorganization of sensory processing in S1 when visual input was removed.

Consistent with the theory, the effects of these infusions depended on the novelty/familiarity of the conditioned stimulus as well as the manner in which it was paired with foot shock.

We quantified the growth cost of genetically increasing and decreasing mistranslation rates, and exposure to low antibiotic concentrations, in Escherichia coli. Mistranslation costs were generally lower than the cost imposed by antibiotics, and exacerbated in a strain-specific manner under antibiotic exposure. All strains quickly compensated the antibiotic cost during experimental evolution, via antibiotic- and genotype- specific mutations. In contrast, mistranslation costs were significantly reduced only in some cases, without clear causal mutations. Control populations that evolved without antibiotics consistently compensated the cost of accuracy, and evolved increased antibiotic resistance as a by-product. Our work demonstrates that even when the cost of mistranslation is weak, altered translation accuracy can shape adaptive outcomes and underlying genetic mechanisms, with strong collateral fitness effects for apparently unrelated phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

F.; Holmes, N. M.; Bouton, M.

To probe this content, we examined some of the conditions that allow retrieval and facilitation of an inhibitory memory stored in the IL using optogenetic stimulation in female and male rats. We found that IL stimulation did not facilitate an initial fear extinction session. However, prior experience with fear extinction enabled IL stimulation to facilitate subsequent fear extinction. Importantly, the facilitative effects of IL stimulation were not limited to fear extinction experience, as prior exposure to backward fear conditioning also enabled IL stimulation to enhance later fear extinction. The effects were stimulus-specific and did not depend on the motivational context present during the prior experience, as backward appetitive conditioning allowed IL stimulation to facilitate later fear extinction. Additional experiments ruled out stimulus familiarity as an explanation for the facilitative effects of IL stimulation and demonstrated that IL-mediated facilitations occur in procedures other than fear extinction. Together, these findings demonstrate that the IL stores inhibitory memories that are extremely flexible since they can be retrieved and used across many inhibitory procedures and distinct motivational contexts. These features establish the IL as a critical hub for the flexible application of inhibitory knowledge that allows adaptive responses in dynamic environments.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Sites preferentially reactive with the TMO cation, relative to uncharged dimethyl sulfate (DMS), termed T-sites, reflect preferential interaction of TMO at punctate electronegative pockets created by juxtaposition of a reactive nucleobase with non-bridging oxygen atoms in the RNA backbone.

These models generalize remarkably well to new environments, but it is unclear how neural circuits acquire this flexibility. Compositional representations, which have been observed in the brain, could explain this adaptability. They enable a process called compositional generalization, where independent modules performing different computations can be selected to perform novel composite tasks. In this work, we show that compositional representations emerge in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained solely to predict future sensory inputs. We trained an RNN to predict frames in a visual environment defined by independent latent factors and their corresponding dynamics. We found that the network learned to solve this task by developing a compositional model. Specifically, it had disentangled representations of the latent factors, and formed distinct, modular clusters, each implementing a single dynamic. The network autonomously selected which cluster to use according to the sensory inputs, without task labels, using competitive dynamics between clusters. This modular and disentangled architecture enabled the network to perform compositional generalization, accurately predicting outcomes in novel contexts composed of unseen combinations of dynamics. Our findings explain how an unsupervised mechanism can learn the modular causal structure of an environment in a compositional code.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

The metabolomic capabilities of this phylum remain poorly characterised, with few experimentally confirmed metabolites described. To address these gaps, we combined metabolomic profiling with comparative genomic analysis to explore the functional potential of novel strains within the Acidobacteriaceae family. Genome mining across the phylum for PGPTs revealed the presence and taxon-specific enrichment of genes related to phytohormone production, as well as other genes associated with plant-growth-promoting effects. When tryptophan (Trp) was added to the cultivation medium, it triggered a strong metabolic response in the strains, resulting in measurable changes in the production levels of phytohormones such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and indole-3-pyruvate (iP). Building on these findings, we examined the metabolic reprogramming caused by Trp supplementation, which suppressed the growth of phytopathogenic fungi, leading to the identification of malassezindoles and pityriacitrins as active agents. This was confirmed by isolating and elucidating the structure of pityriacitrin B and a methyl ester through NMR studies.

We confirm the known neurodegeneration-promoting effects of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), including mitochondrial dysfunction, and further discover its disruptive impact on the pathways of glycolysis, GABAergic signaling, and RNA splicing. Additionally, we identify glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), a microbiome-derived secondary bile acid, as a potent regulator of chromatin accessibility and suppressor of genes that protect the brain from age-related, neurodegeneration-promoting insults.

Social experiences occurring at adolescence can affect the expression of the behavioural variability as it is a critical period of brain and cognitive plasticity. Here, we asked how individual variability of social profiles is shaped at adolescence and whether the profiles are associated with regional brain metabolites and gene expressions in the adult brain. At adolescence we determined a 'dominant' profile expressing more dominance, a 'submissive' profile expressing more submission and an 'explorer' profile showing more novelty exploration than social interaction. Adolescent social behaviors are conserved at adulthood. Our data suggest that dominance tendencies already present at adolescence are likely to stabilize throughout life, thus shaping future social behaviors. Our results show that social profiles are not related to sex and life environment. However, being more dominant, interactive and socially motivated shape dopaminergic olfactory activity at adolescence. Also, showing the explorer or submissive profiles is associated with an opposite serotonin pattern in the cerebellum, but a similar kynurenine pattern in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, thus pointing toward major neurotransmitter systems in key regions for brain health.

However, the molecular mechanisms that set the 24-hour period remain poorly defined. Here, using single-molecule imaging and nascent RNA sequencing, we uncover an unexpected RNA-based molecular timer: a single intron in the Drosophila timeless (tim) gene that regulates circadian period length by controlling mRNA localization. Strikingly, we find that [~]50% of tim mRNAs are localized to the nucleus due to inefficient post-transcriptional splicing of a single intron (which we named intron P), in contrast to other core clock transcripts that localize predominantly to the cytoplasm. CRISPR-mediated removal of intron P abolishes nuclear retention of tim transcripts, leading to accelerated TIM protein accumulation and a shortened [~]22-hour period with reduced rhythmic robustness. Remarkably, insertion of intron P alone into heterologous reporters is sufficient to promote nuclear retention in both Drosophila and human cells, acting as a conserved checkpoint that withholds transcripts in the nucleus until splicing is complete. Finally, we identify three RNA-binding proteins, two repressors (Hrb27C and Squid) and one activator (Qkr58E-2, a Sam68 homolog), that modulate intron P splicing in a rheostat-like manner.

Structural MRI scans were acquired from 391 infants at birth (193 females, 198 males; mean age = 8 days), with follow-up behavioural assessments conducted in toddlerhood (mean age = 18 months). Results: Results demonstrated that larger neonatal brain volumes were associated with lower autistic traits and higher cognitive, language and motor outcomes. A higher gestational age and weight at birth were associated with higher scores on various of these outcomes - an effect that was partially mediated by larger brain volumes at birth. Females showed higher language scores compared to males, though this effect was suppressed rather than mediated by neonatal brain volumes.

Yet the neural circuit that transforms gustatory input into motivationally relevant signals remains poorly defined in any model system. In Drosophila melanogaster, substantial progress has been made in mapping the sensorimotor pathway for feeding and the architecture of the dopaminergic reinforcement system. However, where and how valence is first assigned to a taste has long been a mystery. Here, we identified a pair of subesophageal zone interneurons in Drosophila, termed Fox, that impart positive valence to sweet taste and convey this signal to the mushroom body, the fly's associative learning center. We show that Fox neuron activity is necessary and sufficient to drive appetitive behaviors and can override a tastant's intrinsic valence without impairing taste quality discrimination. Furthermore, Fox neurons transmit the positive valence to specific dopaminergic neurons that mediate appetitive memory formation. Our findings reveal a circuit mechanism that transforms sweet sensation into a reinforcing signal to support learned sugar responses. The Fox neurons exhibit a convergent-divergent \"hourglass\" circuit motif, acting as a bottleneck for valence assignment and distributing motivational signals to higher-order centers. This architecture confers both robustness and flexibility in reward processing: an organizational principle that may generalize across species.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

To assess whether human uncertainty representations align with the model's, we compared human confidence judgments, which might indirectly reflect uncertainty representations, to confidence judgments extracted from the model's uncertainty.

We previously showed that homozygous deletion of Cacna1c in dopamine receptor 1 (D1)-expressing cells enhances remote (30 days post-training) contextual fear memory in male mice. Here, we extend these findings by examining sex- and gene dosage-specific behavioral consequences of Cacna1c loss in D1 cells. We find that D1-Cacna1c deletion produces a sex- and gene dosage-dependent effect on fear memory.

Cue-associated fear memory remained unaffected across genotypes. In contrast, females exhibited heightened contextual fear with both heterozygous and homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss at 24-hrs, 7-days, and 30-days post-training, indicating increased sensitivity to contextual aversive learning. Cue-associated fear memory was higher at 24-hrs but normalized at later time points in females.

Moderate levels of arousal are typically associated with optimal cognitive performance. However, the interaction between arousal and attention remains poorly understood in humans, especially during development. In this study, we investigated whether experimentally modulating tonic arousal, the baseline level of physiological alertness, affects attentional processing in children (N = 44, aged 6-8) and adults (N = 46, aged 18-35). Participants performed an active auditory three-stimulus (standard, novel, target) oddball task, designed to assess selective attention to target tones and distraction by novel sounds. Prior to each task block, tonic arousal was manipulated using music or videos varying in arousing content. Physiological responses were recorded continuously (skin conductance, pupil dilation, heart rate) to index both tonic arousal and transient, phasic changes in arousal triggered by task events. While tonic arousal modulation was successful, as confirmed by skin conductance levels, Bayesian analyses provided evidence for no effect of this modulation on subsequent attentional processing. Importantly, children generally exhibited stronger phasic arousal responses, particularly to task-irrelevant novel sounds, reflecting less mature regulation of attention and arousal.

Here we use a conditional mouse model of graded CIN in combination with longitudinal monitoring of DMBA/TPA-initiated skin tumors to show that low CIN increases the frequency of skin tumor initiation, while higher CIN accelerates onset and growth rates. Strikingly, gene recombination analysis of the tumors reveals that upon high CIN induction the fast-growing tumors originate from rare low CIN cells, suggesting a strong non-cellautonomous effect of high CIN. Gene expression analysis and immunohistochemistry show that high CIN causes epidermal hyperplasia, immune evasion and a regenerative response that stimulates low CIN tumor growth beyond what is achieved by induction of low CIN alone. Such cell-extrinsic effects may be a common mechanism of tumor formation by CIN, as we observe it also in CIN-induced tumors of the intestine, breast and mesentery. When high CIN is induced in established skin tumors, mimicking CINbased therapy, tumors regress but relapse quickly. Relapsed tumors, too, arose from rare low CIN cells. Our findings have implications for our understanding of the contributions of CIN to cancer initiation and progression and give caution to the rationale for CIN therapies.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

We show that KIF5A directly binds mRNAs encoding synaptic ribosomal proteins and is required for their synaptic localization and for maintaining normal synaptic composition and function. Additionally, we show ALS-linked KIF5A mutations confer gain-of-function properties, enhancing mRNA binding, increasing synaptic ribosomal protein accumulation, inducing neuronal hyperexcitability, and impairing stress responses.

Direct correction of mtDNA mutations may offer a cure for such diseases. We propose a novel strategy based on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) oligonucleotide delivery into mitochondria and intrinsic microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) for mtDNA editing. This strategy enables introduction of multiple predefined nucleotide changes in mtDNA. For this, the presence of MMEJ activity in the human mitochondrial lysates was confirmed. 49 bp DNA oligonucleotide duplexes, fused to an RNA hairpin previously identified as a mitochondrial import signal, were delivered into the mitochondria of cultured human cells. Delivery of these donor dsDNA molecules, homological to an ND4 site of mtDNA and bearing designed nucleotide changes, led to a low but statistically significant introduction of the designed nucleotide changes into mtDNA. Donor dsDNA delivery combined with the CRISPR/mito-AsCas12a system also resulted in a statistically significant number of an expected concomitant change of five nucleotides distributed across a 16-nucleotide ND4 site of the mitochondrial genome. The proposed strategy may become an efficient mtDNA editing tool suitable for the correction of near-homoplasmic mutations such as Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)-associated mutations in the ND4 gene of mtDNA.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Compared to DNA, mRNA sequences are much more concise and information-dense, which makes mRNA an ideal language through which to explore various biological principles. In this study, we present NUWA, a large mRNA language foundation model leveraging a BERT-like architecture, trained with curriculum masked language modeling and supervised contrastive loss for unified mRNA sequence perception, understanding, and generation. For pretraining, we collected and utilized large-scale mRNA coding sequences comprising approximately 80 million sequences from 19,676 bacterial species, 83 million from 4,688 eukaryotic species, and 2.1 million from 702 archaeal species, and pre-trained three domain-specific models respectively. This enables NUWA to learn the coding sequence patterns across the tree of life. The fine-tuned NUWA model demonstrates superior performance across a range of downstream tasks. It excels not only in RNA-related perception tasks but also shows strong capability in cross-modal protein-related tasks. On the generation front, NUWA can produce natural-like mRNA sequences and, when provided with a protein sequence, optimize mRNA designs for enhanced codon adaptation index in host organisms. A key advantage of our approach is its adaptability: NUWA can be effectively fine-tuned on smaller, task-specific datasets to generate functional mRNAs with desired properties, without relying on pre-defined biological constraints. To our knowledge, this represents the first mRNA language model for unified sequence perception and generation, offering a versatile platform for programmable mRNA design.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Although mitochondria are central to this metabolic plasticity, it remains unclear whether mitochondrial dysfunction itself can dictate macrophage polarization. Using macrophage-specific OPA1 knockout mice, we investigated how mitochondrial dysfunction influences macrophage metabolism and immune homeostasis. Loss of OPA1 caused severe impairment of OXPHOS, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and a compensatory glycolytic shift, driving M0 and M2 macrophages toward an M1-like bioenergetic state. Integrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed strong priming of OPA1-deficient macrophages towards classical activation, including accumulation of M1-associated metabolites (lactate, succinate, itaconate) and upregulation of NF-kB-driven and other inflammatory gene programs, resulting in increased secretion of IL-6 and TNF even in the absence of stimulation. Functionally, this metabolic shift primed non-activated and M2 macrophages toward partial M1 polarization with enhanced bactericidal capacity, while simultaneously suppressing M2-associated processes such as proliferation, efferocytosis, and expression of Arg1, CD206, and RELMa. In vivo, OPA1{Delta}M mice displayed reduced peritoneal macrophage abundance, impaired self-renewal after IL-4 complex stimulation, and compensatory monocyte recruitment. The remaining macrophages exhibited increased MHCII and reduced RELMa expression, consistent with partial M1 skewing and loss of alternative activation. These local alterations were mirrored systemically: blood profiling revealed enhanced T-cell activation and sex-specific remodeling of immune composition during inflammation and aging. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction serves as a cell-intrinsic cue that primes macrophages toward a glycolytic, pro-inflammatory phenotype while constraining their M2 properties and proliferative capacities. This dual metabolic and functional rewiring highlights mitochondrial integrity as a pivotal determinant of macrophage immunometabolic identity and reveals how its disruption can reshape both local and systemic immune homeostasis.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Prior work has emphasized peripheral blood or murine models, leaving a gap in how plastic Th programs coexist and evolve in the human intestinal niche in IBD. We profiled CD4+ T cells from ileocolonoscopic biopsies and paired blood of IBD patients and non-IBD controls, combining spectral flow cytometry with functional assays and histology to map subset composition, activation, and spatial relationships across disease activity states. Here we show that IBD exhibits a dynamic, tissue-embedded CD4+ landscape, characterized by inflammatory expansion, regulatory-Th17 plasticity, branched trajectories toward regulatory and resident fates, coordinated CD4-CD8 networks, and context-dependent cytokine suppression, collectively shaping aberrant mucosal immunity. Specifically, inflamed mucosa harbored a marked expansion of CD4+ T cells that contracted in remission. Unbiased t-SNE-based analysis revealed several Th populations and linked a ROR{gamma}t+ compartment with enhanced T-bet expression to the progression of inflammation. Foxp3 cells co-expressing ROR{gamma}t also emerged within the inflamed niche, indicating regulatory-Th17 plasticity. Trajectory visualization revealed a potential branched differentiation path towards either a regulatory phenotype or a tissue-resident phenotype, with both termini expressing activation/proliferation markers. Correlation network analysis connected pro-inflammatory CD4+ states to T-bet+ and Granzyme-B+ CD8+ subsets, indicative of crosstalk between helper and cytotoxic lineages. Histology corroborated this organization, showing frequent interactions between CD4+ and CD8+ tissue-resident cells in the lamina propria and epithelial border. In functional assays, TCR stimulation during active disease revealed broad suppression of CD4+ pro-inflammatory cytokines concomitant with expansion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Conversely, a memory Th subset co-expressing HLA-DR and CD38 retained multifunctionality, producing elevated levels of IFN{gamma}, IL-21, IL-22 and IL-10. Together, these results provide insight into how regulatory-effector plasticity, tissue residency, and CD4-CD8 coordination structure the human intestinal immune landscape in IBD, providing a rational for therapies to rebalance resident and regulatory programs while preserving beneficial memory responses.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Through comprehensive transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that FSCloSSCloF4/80loCD11blo macrophages exhibit a specialized phagocytic program, marked by upregulated actin cytoskeleton regulators (e.g., Arp2/3 complex) and pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g., NF-kB).

Phosphoablative mutation of a conserved IDR phosphosite has strong effect on kinase-activity-dependent phenotypes, including intrinsic {beta}-lactam resistance and stationary phase survival. Using a synthetic quantitative reporter for kinase activity, mutational analysis, and mathematical modeling, we show that phosphorylation of the IDR promotes trans autoactivation of the kinase, and that this modification is essential for amplifying kinase activity in response to a signal. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that this IDR and associated putative phosphosites proximal to the kinase domain are highly conserved across prokaryotic species that diverged at the last universal common ancestor.

Although these viruses are highly pathogenic in animal models, human infections have generally been mild, revealing a striking discrepancy. Here, we characterized the cattle-derived human H5N1 isolate A/Texas/37/2024 (TX37-H5N1) using three-dimensional human respiratory organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.

These findings suggest that TX37-H5N1 fails to trigger the strong innate responses, including robust cytokine production, that are typically associated with severe H5N1 disease and are thought to contribute to cytokine storm-medicated pathogenesis. This attenuated response may help explain the discrepancy between the high pathogenicity of TX37-H5N1 in animal models and its mild clinical presentation in humans.

Using fungal isolation and high-throughput metagenomics, EPF persistence assays, and continuous monitoring of date palm health, the changes in microbiota following application were assessed. First, it was evident that EPF preemptive treatments benefit palm protection against the weevil. While both EPF persisted for 180 days post-application, their effectiveness diverged, with B. bassiana having a longer protection period. Overall community composition showed no major changes following EPF applications; however, transient alterations favored local EPF genera, with dominant taxa being more likely to persist. EPF from less diverse families caused more substantial shifts, enhancing nitrogen-fixating bacteria, carbon-degrading bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea, thereby affecting nutrient cycling.

Due to climate change, both the extent and duration of sea ice cover is expected to rapidly decline, leading to complex shifts in disturbance regimes with unknown impacts on successional dynamics and biodiversity in benthic communities. We introduce an individual-based model to study the assemblage dynamics of Bryozoa, sessile, suspension feeding animals which are key pioneers in the shallows. The model captures colonisation events, colony growth as well as intra- and interspecific overgrowth competition for space between colonies. Mortality due to predation is modelled as the removal of zooids within small areas of the model world. Using the model, we simulate various disturbance regimes, e.g. by varying the timing of ice-scour events, the length of the growing season and the spatial distribution of predation events. We find that the timing of ice-scour events throughout the growing season has only minor short-term effects on successional dynamics in bryozoan assemblages, while an extended growing season substantially accelerates succession in the long term. We furthermore find that relatively rare but large predation events lead to a slower recovery, whereas relatively frequent but small events result in a faster succession with higher overall abundances. These results highlight that in order to understand how benthic biodiversity will be impacted by climate change, it is necessary to consider the interplay between biotic interactions and complex changes in physical disturbance regimes.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Exact Oysters yield closed-form k-mer contributions directly from their weights, without post-hoc attribution. By letting users choose between interpretability and complexity, Oyster provides a unified framework for transparent, high-performance sequence-to-function modeling. We apply Oyster to predict intensities of YY1-DNA interactions in human K562 cells from 500-nt DNA windows and intensities of eleven histone post-translational modifications. Exact and non-Exact variants achieved statistically indistinguishable performance, highlighting that k-mer associations are not necessarily important for all biological phenomena. Modelling of YY1-DNA interactions is dependent on the YY1 motif which is expected but is also dependent on several histone post-translational modifications including H3K9ac and H2AFZ.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Current sequence-based models overlook natural genetic variation across individuals, while population-based models are restricted to variants observed within specific cohorts.

Trained on 21,004 genome--transcriptome pairs from 2,330 donors, VariantFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across both sequence- and population-based prediction tasks, while generalizing better to out-of-distribution contexts--including somatic mutation settings in cancer cell lines--and maintaining robustness across ancestries. Beyond expression prediction, VariantFormer improves eQTL effect size estimation compared to prior methods, with notable gains for lower-frequency and ancestry-specific variants. In applications to Alzheimer's disease, VariantFormer gene embeddings prioritize likely causal genes and relevant tissue contexts, and in silico mutagenesis of known APOE alleles faithfully recovers known risk modifying effects.

Extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) could have therapeutic applications in IBD due to their regenerative potential and immunomodulatory properties. Previous studies investigating the potential of MSC-EVs in IBD have largely administered the vesicles by injection, which does not offer the significant benefits of oral administration, including direct and localised access to the site(s) of intestinal inflammation. Here, we evaluated the stability of MSC-EVs for oral delivery and showed that the EVs disintegrate in gastrointestinal (GI) fluids, with cryogenic electron microscopy revealing the loss of structural integrity. To address this, we developed a double-coating formulation consisting of chitosan and Eudragit S100 to enhance GI stability and facilitate colon-targeted delivery. We demonstrated that coated EVs were resistant to GI fluids and digestive enzymes, and the formulation released intact vesicles in colonic fluid. In a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mouse model, coated EVs reduced disease severity, whereas uncoated EVs performed similarly to the control group. Interestingly, coated MSC-EVs elicited a stronger therapeutic response compared to EVs administered intravenously at the same dose. These findings indicate that oral delivery of MSC-EVs could be an effective route of administration, with appropriate formulation, to treat intestinal inflammation.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Computational models, by effectively integrating comprehensive experimental data, often reinforce this preclinical assessment. Using extensive multi-modal data, we developed swine ventricular digital twins for healthy and chronic myocardial infarction (MI) conditions to investigate the roles of the cardiac conduction system (CS), spatial repolarization heterogeneities, cardiomyocyte orientation, cell-to-cell coupling, and MI characteristics on ventricular function. We analyzed cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and optical (OM) and electroanatomical mapping from 5 healthy and 10 MI pigs. CS architectures were built from OM and ECG recordings. Myocardial fiber orientation, action potential characteristics, and cell-to-cell conductivity in MI tissue were defined from OM and CMR data. Simulated ECGs for healthy and MI models of left anterior descending and left circumflex occlusions were compared to experimental ECGs and used to assess MI-induced changes. Personalized fiber orientation minimally affected electrophysiology, with conduction velocity (CV) and action potential duration (APD) changing less than 3.6% with respect to standard orientation. Accurate CS and repolarization heterogeneities reproduced depolarization (0.76 QRS similarity) and repolarization (0.74 T-wave similarity) patterns. Incorporating experimentally guided MI-induced alterations enabled replication of MI depolarization and repolarization features (relative errors: 0.5% CV, 2.9% APD), yielded realistic T-wave morphologies (0.63 similarity), and revealed ECG patterns specific to vessel-dependent occlusions.

Quantifying the nativeness of a candidate sequence - its likelihood of belonging to natural immune repertoires - has thus emerged as a valuable strategy for hit selection from synthetic libraries, optimisation and humanisation, and for guiding de novo design towards developable candidates. We previously introduced AbNatiV, a transformer-based VQ-VAE for nativeness assessment, which proved effective across multiple nanobody engineering tasks. However, AbNatiV1 operated on unpaired sequences, limiting applicability to conventional VH-VL antibodies. Moreover, its performance on nanobody nativeness was constrained by the limited number and diversity of nanobody repertoires available at the time. Here, we sequenced new camelid repertoires, curated additional recent libraries, and present AbNatiV2: an enhanced architecture comprising various models each trained on >20 million sequences. AbNatiV2 improves nanobody nativeness classification across held-out and diverse test sets, and more robustly detects nativeness changes upon CDR grafting. We also introduce p-AbNatiV2, a cross-attention model fine-tuned on 3.7 million paired human sequences. p-AbNatiV2 provides residue- and sequence-level humanness for VH/VL pairs and learns pairing-likelihood via noise-contrastive training. On held-out tests, it assigns the native pair a higher score in 74% of cases, substantially outperforming recent pairing models. Together, AbNatiV2 and p-AbNatiV2 extend nativeness assessment and engineering to both nanobodies and conventional antibodies, supporting design decisions at single-residue, Fv-sequence, and paired-domain levels.

Classical dynamic programming (DP) algorithms are particularly memory-intensive, especially when computing gap-affine and dual gap-affine alignments. Existing strategies to reduce memory consumption often sacrifice either speed or alignment accuracy. Results: We present Singletrack, an efficient algorithm for backtrace gap-affine and dual gap-affine alignments that requires only storing a single DP matrix. Compared to classical DP algorithms, Singletrack removes the need to store additional matrices (i.e., 2 for gap-affine and 4 for dual gap-affine), significantly reducing memory consumption and, in turn, reducing pressure on the memory hierarchy and improving overall performance. Most importantly, Singletrack is a general backtrace method compatible with state-of-the-art DP-based algorithms and heuristics, such as the Suzuki-Kasahara (SK) and the Wavefront Alignment (WFA) algorithms. Our results demonstrate that Singletrack accelerates the SK implementation of KSW2, used within Minimap2, by up to 1.4. Similarly, Singletrack enhances the performance of the WFA implementation in WFA2-lib by 1.2-2.1x while reducing memory usage by 3x for gap-affine and 5x for dual gap-affine. Compared to the efficient linear-memory BiWFA algorithm, the Singletrack-accelerated version of WFA trades a practical increase in memory usage for up to 5.2x higher performance.

While current mosaic variant callers are primarily designed for short-read sequencing, no method is available for long-read sequencing, which can generate tens of kilobase-long reads to cover complex genomic regions inaccessible to short reads. To fill the gap, we present Clair-Mosaic, a deep-learning-based method for detecting mosaic small variants from long-read data. Clair-Mosaic was trained on hundreds of millions synthetic variants encompassing diverse read coverages and allelic fractions, enabling it to detect low-VAF mosaic variants with high sensitivity in paired-sample and single-sample modes. In addition to neural network prediction, Clair-Mosaic distinguishes genuine mosaic variants from sequencing artifacts by leveraging their inherent haplotype relationship in phased long reads. Furthermore, a Bayesian mosaic-germline discriminator is introduced to distinguish mosaic variants from germline variants. It also employs multiple post-calling filters, including a mosaic variant database and multiple germline population resources, to tag common germline and mosaic variants. Comprehensive benchmarking on synthetic datasets and real samples demonstrated Clair-Mosaic's outstanding performance in ONT and PacBio.

Specifically, the interaction with the cellular membrane controls nanoparticle adhesion, wrapping or full engulfment, which ultimately govern nanoparticle internalization efficiency. Flexible nanocarriers (e.g. liposomes, polymeric, micelles) are particularly attractive because their deformability could help them enhance the probability of successful cellular entry. To understand the physical mechanisms associated with cellular uptake, we investigate the interaction of semi-flexible nanocarriers with a symmetric lipid bilayer using coarse-grained simulations. We represent a flexible nanoparticle using the previously introduced MetaParticle (MP) model and the membrane using the Cooke-Deserno model. By systematically varying nanoparticle properties, i.e., adhesion strength and topology, we identify distinct interaction regimes ranging from surface adhesion and trapping to complete wrapping and endocytosis. These regimes correlate with nanoparticle shape, size and surface properties, providing quantitative design principles for optimizing cellular uptake. Overall, this frame-work offers predictive insight into how the interplay between nanoparticle properties and membrane interaction governs cellular internalization, informing the rational design of next-generation soft nanocarriers.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

To dissect the cellular and structural complexity of AM establishment in rice roots colonized by Rhizophagus irregularis, we applied dual-species spatial transcriptomics to simultaneously monitor plant and fungal gene transcripts at single-cell resolution. This approach revealed surprising differences in transcriptional activity between fungal structures and showed that morphologically similar arbuscules can be transcriptionally distinct. These findings suggest hidden functional diversity among arbuscules at single-cell resolution. Because arbuscules form and degenerate within only a few days, we further sought to capture translational activities across their life span. We pioneered AM-inducible TRAP-seq (Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification followed by RNA-seq) using stage-specific promoters, enabling cell-type- and stage-resolved profiling in AM symbiosis. This revealed extensive spatiotemporal reprogramming of nutrient transport and signalling, with distinct sets of phosphate, nitrogen, and carbon transporters and regulators induced or repressed at different stages of arbuscule development, suggesting that nutrient exchange is dynamically regulated across the arbuscule life cycle. More broadly, cell wall biosynthesis genes and key defence markers were suppressed during arbuscule formation, whereas at a later stage, defence markers were strongly upregulated, suggesting a host-driven shift towards arbuscule termination. Together, these findings highlight the nuanced and dynamic regulation of AM symbiosis at the cellular level, refining our understanding of how nutrient exchange and fungal development are coordinated in space and time.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Their unmatched olfactory capabilities allow them to locate trace-level targets that remain beyond the reach of current technology. However, detection performance can decline without overt behavioral signs, posing a challenge for timely and informed deployment decisions. Identifying subtle precursors to missed alerts remains an open problem with both practical and computational significance. To address this, we recorded detection dogs on a treadmill-based scent delivery system under tightly controlled conditions, enabling precise timing of odor presentation. We focused on the 4.5 seconds preceding each odor pulse to capture anticipatory movement through video and physiological state via sensors. Using markerless pose estimation, we extracted high-resolution joint trajectories, while concurrent recordings provided heart rate, heart rate variability, and core temperature. We trained a spatiotemporal deep learning model that integrates Graph Attention Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks to predict missed indications from these short, pre-stimulus windows. The model successfully identified 85% of missed alerts with 81% precision. Heart rate variability emerged as the most informative physiological input, suggesting a strong autonomic component to declining readiness. To move from isolated predictions to actionable insights, we implemented a Bayesian aggregation framework that estimates each dogs latent miss rate over time. This probabilistic formulation enables adaptation to individual baselines and operational risk thresholds, supporting context-sensitive deployment decisions.

The system integrates 3D-printed mechanical components, Raspberry Pi-based video acquisition, and programmable environmental controls to ensure standardized conditions. A deep learning pipeline segments vials with near-perfect accuracy (IoU > 0.95), while computer vision algorithms quantify climbing trajectories, velocity, and positional zone occupancy at 60 frames per second. The end-to-end workflow converts raw video into time-resolved metrics, supports sex-specific aggregation, and incorporates advanced statistical analyses, including Linear Mixed Effects regression, harmonic mean p-values, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Relative to manual scoring, this automated pipeline yields 2.8-fold faster processing and nearly 800-fold higher data density. Application of the platform uncovered reproducible phenotypes of multiple genotypes. For example, a circadian mutant known as ClockOut, males displayed progressive climbing deficits with age, whereas females-maintained age-resilient trajectories. Moreover, male ClockOut exhibited a reduced performance compared to age-matched control (w1118), however, female ClockOut showed subtle reduction in performance. Additionally, glial-specific knockdown of PolG, encoding the DNA polymerase gamma catalytic subunit, revealed striking sex-dimorphic aging patterns: females outperformed controls at older age, while males exhibited marked decline.

In this study, we systematically identify allosteric communication hubs in RNA and map multiple residue-connected pathways, revealing how these networks are rewired upon mutation and protein binding. To capture these effects under physiological salt conditions, we performed tens of microseconds of atomistic and steered molecular dynamics simulations and computed binding free energies for Tat-TAR complexes across three immunodeficiency virus variants, BIV, HIV-1, and HIV-2. Allosterically coupled sites were identified using contact-based principal component analysis, and communication pathways were traced through an extended graph-network algorithm--the first such application to RNA systems. Two distant motifs--the bulge and the apical loop--emerge as allosteric switches and information hubs: the bulge engages Tat, while the loop interacts with another protein partner, CycT1, both essential for transcriptional activation and antiviral targeting. We find that HIV-2 TAR, with strong loop-bulge coupling and high self-integrity, favour conformational selection and exhibits lower Tat-binding affinity. In contrast, a single C24 insertion in HIV-1 TAR reconfigures communication pathways, enabling an induced-fit mechanism with enhanced affinity. The study not only elucidates an allosteric rewiring between the loop and bulge but also highlights how this communication is dynamically reconfigured upon protein binding. Tat association at the bulge reorganizes and reorients loop residues, thereby promoting the subsequent recruitment of CycT1. This work overall underscores how sequence (even a single mutation) encoded RNA allostery can modulate not only a protein's binding mechanism and affinity but also influence downstream molecular events within transcriptional signalling cascades.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

The results showed that reviewers effectively evaluated Quality and Impact as separate dimensions, with Quality scores being more consistent across reviewers than Impact scores. Importantly, participants strongly supported the core elements of the Discovery Stack model and expressed enthusiasm for its broader adoption to enhance transparency, efficiency, and value in peer review. Future studies will explore integrating this model into a digital platform for reviewing and curating scientific discoveries to improve the production and dissemination of high-quality research.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

At the same time, composite metrics, like Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), gather these indicators to provide an overall measure of the online attention of an article. Communication departments at research institutions aim to help publications reach the general public and, therefore, play a key role in improving the altmetrics performance of scientific articles. However, the most effective strategies to achieve this remain unclear. No standardized protocols exist to guide communication professionals in maximizing the impact of their outreach efforts. Thus, in the present research, carried out by the communication department of a neuroscience research center, we conducted three complementary analyses to help to fill this gap. First, a study involving more than 3,000 neuroscience publications from 8 similar research centers revealed correlations between altmetrics and citations. Second, a retrospective analysis of 201 in-house articles found that active communication campaigns were associated with better altmetric performance, with notable differences between publications that included a press release (PR) and those that did not. Finally, a prospective experiment involving 25 articles examined changes in altmetrics before and after the dissemination of a PR or posting on X. Results showed that PRs significantly increased the number of news mentions and X posts, leading to an average rise of approximately 70 points in the AAS. These findings highlight the importance of PRs in maximizing the societal visibility and impact of scientific publications.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Heidelberg) is a significant cause of human salmonellosis, with resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins posing challenges for clinical management. In this study, we genetically and functionally characterized six plasmids isolated from distinct PFGE-types of S. Heidelberg previously reported in The Netherlands, revealing a chimeric IncC-I1a plasmid that shares similarities with the epidemic pESI plasmid identified in emergent S. Infantis isolates. Our analysis showed the accumulation of genetic determinants conferring resistance to antibiotics (blaCMY-2, tetA and sul2) and heavy metals (mer operon), as well as enhanced pathogenicity (Yersinia high-pathogenicity island). All these elements are located on a stable non-conjugative but likely mobilizable plasmid backbone that imposes only a marginal fitness cost on its bacterial host. This convergence of multidrug resistance and pathogenicity likely enhances bacterial adaptability and virulence, undermining control strategies based solely on reducing selective pressure. The emergence and dissemination of such hybrid plasmids represent an increasing threat to both public and animal health, analogous to that posed by pESI-like plasmids, and underscore the urgent need for integrated genomic surveillance and risk assessment, as their continued expansion could complicate antimicrobial therapy and containment efforts during Salmonella outbreaks.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

However, translating EV-based innovations into real-world products faces substantial challenges, particularly concerning regulatory frameworks and scientific gaps. To address these issues, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) established the Translation, Regulation, and Advocacy Committee (ISEV-TRA) to create an environment that facilitates the translation of EV research into practical societal applications. This report presents the results of the first survey conducted by the ISEV-TRA, assessing the degree to which EVs have been translated into society applications, awareness of EV potential, and the current use of EVs across various industry sectors. Respondents included individuals from Academia, Industry, and dual affiliation (Academia-Industry), provided an initial perspective on EV research and its translational status. The survey highlights the growing interest in EV-based products, suggesting that there is an important wave of efforts to develop these products. Several spinouts created by academic researchers are focusing on EV-based products, a key trend in the field, while large companies are showing increasing interest in EV-based technologies. The expectations and suggestions for the newly established ISEV-TRA underscore the need for a unified approach to accelerate the translation of EV-based technologies into practical applications. The ISEV-TRA is well-positioned to play a key role by providing essential resources, organizing workshops, and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately driving the commercialization of EV-based innovations.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Distinct, asynchronous processes underlie cultural and genetic variation in a bird species with a complex song repertoire", "doi": "10.1101/2025.11.02.684965", "authors": "Arvind, C.; Sawant, S. G.; Srinivasan, R.; GP, A.; Goyal, N.; Warudkar, A.; VV, R.", "abstract": "Cultural and genetic variation in animal populations can arise through different mechanisms, often shaped by geographic distance, climatic factors, and habitat connectivity. The patterns of behavioural and genetic diversity may be concordant or discordant, offering an insight into evolutionary and ecological processes. Birds are a good system to explore these dynamics, as their songs are often compared to human languages, reflecting culturally transmitted behavioural traits. While most research has focused mainly on birds with fixed learning repertoires, our study shifts attention to a tropical species with a highly variable and evolving vocal repertoire, offering a closer analogue to human language. To investigate cultural and genetic variation in species with complex songs, we combine fine-scale acoustic, genetic, and behavioural data across a heterogeneous but isolated landscape. We analysed cultural variation from 10,816 songs using spectral analysis and a linguistic analytical approach of n-grams to evaluate syntax. Behavioural responses were tested through 139 playback trials comparing local and non-local songs. Genetic variation was analysed using 10,638 SNPs from 242 sequenced individuals from across the species distribution. We find that the fundamental units of songs, which are notes, carry more information than the spectral features, such as frequency and time. About one-third of note types are shared across individuals across all populations. However, higher levels of song syntax comprised individual-specific patterns but not local dialects. Higher orders of syntax are thus unique to each bird and may be shared only among neighbours. Geographic distance did not predict song similarity. Playback trials further revealed no clear discrimination between local and non-local songs, indicating a recognition that lacks population-level acoustic signatures. In contrast, genetic data reveal an isolation-by-distance pattern with geographic distance significantly explaining genetic population structure. Climatic and habitat heterogeneity, despite being present, did not explain song and genetic variation. Our results demonstrate that cultural and genetic variation can be shaped by distinct processes: genetic variation follows geographic patterns, while song variation reflects highly individualised learning. We highlight the integration of fine-scale acoustic, genetic, and behavioural data to understand how cultural transmission of behavioural traits and genetic population structure exist in a species with a continuously evolving vocal repertoire.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

P.; Roshchina, M.; Hong, F.; Fernandez, S.; Ruan, S.; Yin, H.", "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for coordinating voluntary movements, yet their precise contribution remains a subject of debate. Using a novel operant counting task, we trained mice to perform a specific number of lever presses to obtain a reward, enabling quantification of continuous kinematics, discrete actions, and action sequences. Optogenetic manipulations of direct pathway (dSPN) and indirect pathway (iSPN) striatal projection neurons exert bidirectional and dissociable influences on both movement steering and action count progression: activation of dSPNs extends press sequences as if resetting an internal accumulator, whereas activation of iSPNs prematurely terminates them, mimicking completion of the count. In vivo calcium imaging reveals distinct yet intermixed populations of dSPNs and iSPNs representing either lever approach or count progression, with ramping activity patterns consistent with accumulation and discharge dynamics. Importantly, the difference between dSPN and iSPN population activity scales with proximity to both spatial and count-based goals, unifying discrete and continuous control within a push/pull model. These findings establish the BG as a central circuit for integrating kinematic and sequential representations to monitor and steer progress toward behavioral goals.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

E.; Meffin, H.; Burkitt, A. N.", "abstract": "Cortical Layer 2/3 has been consistently implicated as the locus of prediction-error signalling in hierarchical models of cortical sensory processing. However, the circuit mechanisms that generate biologically plausible prediction-error (PE) signals remain elusive. A spiking network model is presented here in which two-compartment excitatory pyramidal neurons interact with three inhibitory subtypes: parvalbumin-expressing (PV), somatostatin-expressing (SOM), and vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons,to compute sign-specific prediction errors (positive and negative PEs). Feedforward input targets the soma, whereas top-down feedback reaches the distal apical dendrite, enabling a local somato-dendritic comparison. A PE emerges whenever the balance between excitation and inhibition is selectively disrupted within one compartment, recruiting either positive-error (PE+) or negative-error (PE-) subpopulations of pyramidal neurons. Unlike prior learning-dependent, rate-based accounts, this fixed-weight spiking circuit shows that bidirectional PE signals (PE+ and PE) can arise online from compartment-specific balance without any synaptic weight updates. The model reproduces key experimental observations, including sparse mismatch responses, compartment-specific inhibition, and VIP-mediated disinhibition. Across four canonical sensory-prediction configurations, the circuit maintains a tight balance during matched input and generates bidirectional PE signals only under mismatch. By routing sensory drive from Layer 4 into Layer 2/3 and allowing the resulting PE activity to project toward deeper feedback generators, the model situates Layer 2/3 as a dedicated, feature-specific mismatch detector within a hierarchical inference network. These results provide a mechanistic bridge from dendritic computation to laminar predictive coding, demonstrating how realistic spiking dynamics can implement fast, sign-specific PE signaling without learning.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}

Assessments such as the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) can quantify this variability but understanding underlying mechanisms and identifying distinct and shared atypical organization and function of brain networks remains a challenge. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used to analyze imaging data. However, the relationship between structural brain changes observed in structural MRI (sMRI), the affected brain functional networks inferred from these structural changes, and their connection to ASD phenotypes and scores still requires systematic investigation. In this study, we ensembled 3D CNNs with other artificial intelligence (AI) methods to conduct a comprehensive analysis of macrostructural changes in ASD. We found consistently dominant involvement of (a) the left hemisphere, (b) the frontal and temporal lobe, and (c) the default mode, salience, and language networks in ASD. Our findings highlighted brain network similarities and differences between high and low severity ASD and showed that typically developed brains fall at the low-severity end of the high-to-low severity spectrum of ASD. Our systematic AI approach utilized the phenotypic heterogeneity and spectral nature of ASD to uncover significant structural changes across brain regions and functional networks, correlating the structural, functional, and phenotypical heterogeneity of individuals with ASD. This enabled us to identify known and novel global and local brain region and network changes in ASD in relation to phenotypes and clinical scores that can guide diagnostic subtyping.", "date": "2025-11-02", "journal": ""}
