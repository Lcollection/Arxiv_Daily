In general, one observes a large variability in such studies, which reduces the confidence one can have in such models. It is important to understand the causes of this variability as a first step toward reducing it. For a given data set, the variability in a multi-model study can arise from uncertainty in structure or in parameter values for a given structure. Previous studies have made assumptions about the origin of parameter uncertainty, and then quantified its contribution, generally finding that parameter uncertainty is less important than structure uncertainty. However, those studies do not take account of the full parameter variability in multi-model studies. Here we propose estimating parameter uncertainty based on open-call multi-model ensembles where the same structure is used by more than one modeling group. The variability in such a case is due to the full variability of parameters among modeling groups. Then structure and parameter contributions can be estimated sing random effects analysis of variance. Based on three multi-model studies for simulating wheat phenology, it is found that the contribution of parameter uncertainty to total uncertainty is, on average, more than twice as large as the uncertainty from structure. A second estimate, based on a comparison of two different calibration approaches for multiple models leads to a very similar result. We conclude that improvement of crop models requires as much attention to parameters as to model structure.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

In contrast, we propose a radically different approach for the PylRS system: by starting with enzymes that evolved to cope with instability in order to adapt to cold conditions, potentially offering greater resilience to mutational changes. By finding and further engineering a psychrophilic (\"cold\") OTS from Methanococcoides burtonii, we developed an alternative to the widely used mesophilic and thermophilic systems. This novel OTS demonstrated exceptional in vivo efficiency for a broad range of substrates, even at very low ncAA concentrations and low cultivation temperatures. The general versatility of the PylRS system across a wide range of applicable host organisms suggests that the Cold-OTS has the potential to also improve protein yields in these hosts and help to drive the transformation of the expanded genetic code from an academic pursuit into a high-value, chemistry-driven biotechnology.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Data harmonization techniques are typically part of the pipeline in multi-centric studies to address systematic biases and ensure the comparability of the data. However, most multi-centric studies require centralized data, which may result in exposing individual patient information. This poses a significant challenge in data governance, leading to the implementation of regulations such as the GDPR and the CCPA, which attempt to address these concerns but also hinder data access for researchers. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative approach in machine learning, enabling models to be collaboratively trained on decentralized data without the need for data centralization or sharing. In this paper, we present Fed-ComBat, a federated framework for batch effect harmonization on decentralized data. Fed-ComBat extends existing centralized linear methods, such as ComBat and distributed as d-ComBat, and nonlinear approaches like ComBat-GAM in accounting for potentially nonlinear and multivariate covariate effects. By doing so, Fed-ComBat enables the preservation of nonlinear covariate effects without requiring centralization of data and without prior knowledge of which variables should be considered nonlinear or their interactions, differentiating it from ComBat-GAM. We assessed Fed-ComBat and existing approaches on simulated data and multiple cohorts comprising healthy controls (CN) and subjects with various disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The results of our study show that Fed-ComBat performs better than centralized ComBat when dealing with nonlinear effects and is on par with centralized methods like ComBat-GAM. Through experiments using synthetic data, Fed-ComBat demonstrates a superior ability to reconstruct the target unbiased function, achieving a 35% improvement (RMSE=0.5952) compared to d-ComBat (RMSE=0.9162) and a 12% improvement compared to our proposal to federate ComBat-GAM, d-ComBat-GAM (RMSE=0.6751). Additionally, Fed-ComBat achieves comparable results to centralized methods like ComBat-GAM for MRI-derived phenotypes without requiring prior knowledge of potential nonlinearities.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

It enables researchers and clinicians to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of different pipelines and identify the most effective and reliable ones. In this study, we evaluated and compared the performance of our in-house consensus exome pipeline with a widely recognized gold standard Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) pipeline. Four datasets were used for evaluation, three 1000 Genome Project (1KGP) datasets and one Prostate cancer (PCa) Sample. The consensus pipeline consistently demonstrated a higher average transition-to-transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio, indicating enhanced precision in identifying single nucleotide variant (SNV) calls. This suggests that the consensus pipeline excels in effectively discerning true genetic variations from sequencing artefacts, particularly in the context of exome sequencing. Additionally, the pipeline exhibited increased sensitivity in detecting pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in the PCa sample, further highlighting its efficacy in identifying clinically relevant variants. We also conducted a trio exome analysis with the use of two trio pipelines, viz. VarScan Trio and GATK joint calling pipelines on our erstwhile Congenital Pouch Colon (CPC) samples from our rare disease cohort which we published earlier and found that the GATK predicted a significantly higher number of variants compared to VarScan.

K.; Raghuram, G. V.; Shabrish, S.; Mittra, I.", "abstract": "Background: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays an important evolutionary role in prokaryotes, but it is thought to be less frequent in mammals. We previously reported that cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) - chromosomal fragments released from the billions of dying cells that circulate in human blood - are horizontally transferred to healthy cells with biological effects. However, the underlying mechanism and function of these effects remained unclear. Methods: We treated NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts cells with cfChPs isolated from human serum and serially passaged the cells. The intracellular activities of cfChPs were analysed using chromatin fibre fluorography, cytogenetic analysis, immuno-fluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridisation. Results: We discovered that the internalised cfChPs were almost exclusively comprised of non-coding DNA, and the disparate DNA sequences contained within them had randomly combined to form complex concatemers some of which were ostensibly multi-mega base pairs in size. The concatemers exhibited variable and bizarre spatial relationships with the host cell interphase DNA with many remaining in the cytoplasm and others aligning themselves with the mouse chromosomal DNA. The concatemers autonomously performed many functions attributable to the nuclear genome. Being associated with DNA polymerase, the concatemers could synthesize DNA and autonomously replicate themselves without heed to the mitotic cycle of the host cell. They could synthesise RNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomal RNA, ribosomal proteins, and generate numerous human proteins, including oncogenes, within the mouse cells which manifested as complex and highly amplified multi-peptide fusion proteins. The concatemers harboured human LINE-1 and Alu elements, which being associated with DNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase and transposes could markedly amplify themselves and increase their copy number with time in culture with the potential to rearrange themselves within the mouse genome. The above findings were reproducible in four other cell lines derived from different species suggesting that horizontal transfer of cfChPs may be a universal phenomenon. Conclusions: Our results lead us to propose that: 1) a cell simultaneously harbours two autonomous genome forms: one that is inherited (hereditary genome) and numerous others that are acquired (satellite genomes); 2) satellite genomes may potentially have evolutionary functions given their ability to serve as vehicles for transposable elements and to generate a plethora of novel proteins; 3) transposable elements are foreign genetic elements that are acquired from dying cells via HGT; 4) non-coding DNA has many hidden biological functions that remain dormant but are activated following cellular apoptosis to become detectable in association with the cfChP concatemers; 5) within-self HGT occurs in mammals on a massive scale via the medium of cfChP concatemers that have undergone extensive and complex modifications resulting in their behaviour as foreign genetic elements.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

However, a clear picture of how numerosity information is represented alongside other non-numeric features across the cortex is still lacking. To address this, we conducted a whole-brain 3T fMRI study with thirty-one adult subjects (eighteen females) engaged in a numerosity estimation task involving visual sets varying in number, item size, total item area, total field area, and density, thus allowing us to perform a tight control of the stimulus properties. Using model-based semipartial correlation representational similarity analyses, we found that numerosity is represented independently of other visual properties already in early visual areas and amplified in both retinotopic and non-retinotopic associative areas along both the dorsal and ventral streams. Dimensionality reduction analyses of BOLD activity patterns revealed clearly distinct neural representational geometries of numerosity across brain regions: a one-dimensional representation of numerical rank in early visual and in associative retinotopic regions of the ventral stream, and a curved structure encoding rank-order together with distance to end-point in associative regions of both the dorsal and ventral stream. These findings indicate that numerosity is represented over and above other visual features broadly in the brain but with substantially different neural coding schemes across regions, and are discussed in light of two non necessarily exclusive interpretations.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

B.; Sandoval Acuna, C.; Pacior Pampin, Y.; Klanicova, K.; Blazkova, K.; Sedlacek, R.; Stursa, J.; Werner, L.; Truksa, J.", "abstract": "In principle, two separate ways to target cancer cells exist, the first one using iron deprivation and subsequent dysfunction of iron-dependent enzymes, and the second one inducing iron overload that leads to cell death known as ferroptosis. In this study, we introduce a compound that uniquely employs both pathways at once - mitochondrially targeted deferasirox (mitoDFX). MitoDFX deprives cells of biologically active iron while simultaneously depleting the primary cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and inducing lipid peroxidation, both of which are hallmarks of ferroptosis. The role of the GSH is further supported by enhanced cell death in glutathione peroxidase 4 KO cells (GPX4 KO) induced by mitoDFX. This response is further exacerbated by simultaneous inhibition of glutathione metabolism or the pentose phosphate pathway. MitoDFX strongly affects the structure and function of mitochondria, leading to its fragmentation, ROS production and induction of mitophagy. Moreover, we found that mitoDFX treatment markedly reduces mitochondrial translation and downregulates levels of enzymatic subunits coupled with the ETC/TCA cycle as well as DNA replication and transcription, which could explain its strong cytostatic effects. In summary, mitoDFX achieves high activity and selectivity against cancer cells that seems unattainable for the conventional untargeted iron chelators, which have adverse effects on systemic iron metabolism. Our novel, targeted chelator has also shown enhanced efficacy in animal models, surpassing other mitochondrially targeted drugs and making mitoDFX a promising candidate for the development of future selective and highly effective cancer therapies.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Using reinforcement learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations and constant pH MD, we investigate how clinically observed mutations in the {Omega}-loop (at amino acids V211, G214, E219, and Y221) alter the structure and function of PDC-3. Our findings reveal that these substitutions modulate the dynamic flexibility of the {Omega}-loop and the R2-loop, reshaping the cavity of the active site. In particular, E219K and Y221A disrupt the tridentate hydrogen bond network around K67, thus lowering its pKa and promoting proton transfer to the catalytic residue S64. Markov state models reveal that E219K achieves enhanced catalysis by adopting stable, long-lived 'active' conformations, whereas Y221A facilitates activity by rapidly toggling between bond-formed and bond-broken states. In addition, substitutions influence key hydrogen bonds that control the opening and closure of the active-site pocket, consequently influencing the overall size. The pocket expands in all nine clinically identified variants, creating additional space to accommodate bulkier R1 and R2 cephalosporin side chains. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic basis for how single residue substitutions in the {Omega}-loop affect catalytic activity. Insights into the structural dynamics of the catalytic site advance our understanding of emerging {beta}-lactamase variants and can inform the rational design of novel inhibitors to combat drug-resistant P. aeruginosa.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular pathways by which Syngap1 acts on GABAergic neurons, and whether they are similar or different from the mechanisms underlying its effects in excitatory neurons, is unknown. Here, we examined whether, and how, embryonic-onset Syngap1 haploinsufficiency restricted to GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) impacts their synaptic and intrinsic properties in adult primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that Syngap1 haploinsufficiency significantly affected the intrinsic properties, overall leading to increased firing threshold, and decreased excitatory synaptic drive of Parvalbumin (PV)+ neurons in adult Layer IV A1. Further, the AMPA component of thalamocortical evoked-EPSC was decreased in PV+ cells from mutant mice. Mutant somatostatin (SST)+ interneurons exhibited decreased spontaneous excitatory input and impaired evoked firing without alterations in firing threshold. Finally, we found that the selective blocking of voltage-gated D-type K+ currents was sufficient to rescue PV+ mutant cell-intrinsic properties to wild-type levels. Together, these data suggest that Syngap1 plays a specific role in the maturation of PV+ cell intrinsic properties and synaptic drive, and its haploinsufficiency may lead to reduced PV cell recruitment in the adult A1, which could in turn contribute to the auditory processing alterations found in SYNGAP1-ID preclinical models and patients.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

We experimentally compared nest excavation in colonies seeded from a single mated queen and allowed to grow for six months to excavation triggered by a catastrophic event in colonies with fixed demographics, where the age of each worker, including the queen, is known. The areas excavated by equal group sizes differed significantly between these conditions: heterogeneous populations in naturally growing colonies as well as cohorts of young ants dig larger areas than old ant cohorts. Moreover, we find that younger ants tend to dig slanted tunnels while older ants dig straight down. This is a novel form of age polyethism, where an ant's age dictates not only her likelihood to engage in a task but also the way she performs the task. We further present a quantitative model that predicts that under normal growth, digging is predominantly performed by the younger ants while after a catastrophe all ants dig to restore lost nest volume. The fact that the nests of naturally growing colonies exhibit slanted tunnels strengthens this prediction.

To address this issue, we combined immunolabeling, calcium imaging, electrophysiology, chemogenetic tools, and behavioral assays in mouse pilocarpine TLE models to investigate the survival and changes in the activity of a large population of Dlx-expressing interneurons and test the effect of their manipulation on seizures and cognitive impairments.

In addition, Dlx-expressing interneurons exhibited reduced activity in vitro, correlated to hypersynchrony in the CA1 network. Enhancing CA1 interneuron discharge in vitro using a chemogenetic strategy rescued CA1 activity and synchronization. In vivo, a minimally invasive strategy to normalize interneuron activity does not rescue the full range of pathological features associated with TLE, but significantly reduces some cognitive impairments, such as behaviors related to nonspatial learning and memory.

The New Zealand rhaphidophorid fauna comprises high phylogenetic diversity throughout its mesic zone, with most species occurring above-ground. In contrast, the Australian fauna is poorly known, with an apparently greater relative proportion of species utilising caves as refugia. A robust phylogenetic framework is needed to underpin future taxonomic work on the group and potentially contrasting patterns of taxonomic diversity within Macropathinae. Here, we performed fossil-calibrated phylogenetic analysis using whole mitochondrial genomes and nuclear markers to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Macropathinae, with a focus on the Australian fauna. By dramatically increasing taxon sampling relative to past studies, we recovered the Australian fauna as rampantly polyphyletic, with the remaining Macropathinae nested amongst six distinct Australian lineages. Deep divergences between major clades imply additional Australian lineages remain undetected, either due to extinction or sampling bias, and have likely confounded past biogeographic signal. We inferred the radiation of Macropathinae began during the Lower Cretaceous prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana with a potential Pangaean origin for Rhaphidophoridae.

Boundaries furthermore promote temporal pattern separation within left hippocampal dentate gyrus, which correlates with heightened LC responses to those same transition points. Unlike transient LC effects, indirect structural and functional markers of elevated background LC activation correlate with reduced arousal-related LC and pupil responses at boundaries, suggesting that hyperarousal disrupts event segmentation.

Early hyperexcitability in cortical neurons is a recognized endophenotype in ASD. Here, we investigated EV-mediated effects in the context of Shank3 deficiency using human iPSC-derived cortical neurons and Shank3B-/- mice. Switching EVs between Shank3 mutant and control neurons revealed that Shank3 mutant-derived EVs transferred the hyperexcitability and accelerated maturation phenotypes to control neurons. This was driven by enriched synaptic proteins (e.g., ACTB, CFL1, AGRN, CLSTN1) in Shank3 mutant-derived EVs as confirmed by proteomic analysis. Conversely, control EVs failed to rescue mutant phenotypes consistent with their lower enrichment for synaptic proteins and related pathways. Further, EVs from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and healthy donor iPSCs, containing synaptic modulators such as complement proteins (C1R, C1S), plasticity-related proteins (MDK, IGFBP3), and homeostatic regulators (FGF2, SFRP1), rescued the hyperexcitability and normalized the maturation in Shank3 mutant neurons. Moreover, intranasal administration of iPSC-derived EVs in Shank3B-/- mice significantly ameliorated ASD-like behavioral deficits, underscoring their therapeutic potential.

Healthy (Muc2+/-) offspring of glyphosate-exposed mice exhibited colonic goblet cell depletion, reduced mucin-2 expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both F1 and F2 generations. These healthy (Muc2+/-) offspring also developed metabolic dysfunction, including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and reduced GLP-1 in serum. Behavioral deficits were also observed in healthy (Muc+/-) mice including reduced locomotion and working memory, and these changes were associated with altered microbiome composition and gut-brain mediators. These findings suggest that prenatal glyphosate exposure, even below regulatory thresholds, may disrupt multiple physiological systems across generations, highlighting the need for further research and regulatory consideration.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Swimming, which imposes greater mechanical demands, enhances sarcomere branching compared to crawling. In dystrophin-deficient dys-1(eg33) mutants, impaired longitudinal anchorage combined with persistent lateral tension leads to myofibrillar buckling and wavy fiber deformation, echoing features of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These results position C. elegans as a tractable model for dissecting the biomechanical roles of sarcomere networks in muscle adaptation and disease.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

For example, in the development of new monoclonal antibodies, the search for optimal upstream conditions (such as feeding strategy, pH, temperature, and media composition) is often conducted using sophisticated high-throughput (HT) mini-bioreactor systems, while the integration of machine learning tools for experimental design and operation in these systems have not matured accordingly.

Recently, S. aureus was recognized as intracellular pathogen, whereby the intracellular niche promotes immune evasion and antibiotic resistance. Interaction of S. aureus with versatile host cell receptors was described previously, suggesting that internalization of the pathogen can occur via several pathways. It remains elusive whether the pathway of internalization can affect the intracellular fate of the bacteria. Here, we identified a mechanism governing cellular uptake of S. aureus which relies on lysosomal Ca2+, lysosomal exocytosis and occurs concurrently to other well-known entry pathways within the same host cell population. This internalization pathway is rapid and active within only few minutes after bacterial contact with host cells. Compared to slow bacterial internalization, the rapid pathway demonstrates altered phagosomal maturation as well as translocation of the pathogen to the host cytosol and ultimately results in different rates of intracellular bacterial replication and host cell death. We show that these alternative infection outcomes are caused by the mode of bacterial uptake.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

This study investigated the effects of kinematic and dynamic demands on reaching using a home-based virtual reality task. Participants with and without cerebellar ataxia reached to target locations designed to elicit a range of coordination strategies between shoulder and elbow joint movements. Compared with control subjects, cerebellar subjects presented greater initial reaching direction errors, larger hand trajectory curvatures, and more variability. Kinematic simulations indicated that early hand movement errors were sensitive to the required onset times and rates of joint movements and were most impaired when opposite direction joint movements were required (e.g., elbow extension with shoulder flexion). Dynamic analysis revealed that cerebellar participants' movements were more impaired in reaching directions where interaction torques would normally assist the desired elbow and shoulder movements. These reach directions were also those that required joint movements in opposite directions. Overall, our data suggest that reaching deficits in cerebellar ataxia result from 1) the early-phase motion planning deficits that are exacerbated by stringent timing coordination requirements and 2) the inability to compensate for interaction torques, particularly when they assist the intended movement.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

STP modulates EI summation across patterns, first amplifying, then reducing responses. We parameterized a multiscale model of network projections onto hundreds of E and I boutons on a CA1 neuron, each including stochastic signaling to mediate STP. The model detected mismatches in trains of input patterns, which we experimentally confirmed. Mismatch selectivity depends on pattern sparsity, network weights, and connectivity, and neuronal spiking makes it sharper.

In this framework, a steeper power spectrum (i.e., one with a larger spectral exponent {beta}) is indicative of stronger inhibitory tone and thus lower E/I ratio, and vice versa. While the tools commonly utilized for estimating {beta} are mostly consistent, there appears to be a lack of standardization among data processing protocols for slope analysis. In this work our goal is to draw attention to a fundamental consequence of this issue, namely that even in a confined, comparative research environment, applying different pre-processing steps to electroencephalography (EEG) data can lead to conflicting conclusions in terms of the E/I ratio. To this end, we analyzed resting-state EEG recordings in two independent datasets, containing data collected with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), with the latter considered as a physiological state with stronger inhibitory tone. Our analysis confirmed consistently in both cohorts that applying different spatial filtering schemes in an otherwise identical analytical pipeline indicated a decrease in E/I ratio over the prefrontal cortex in one case, but not the other when transitioning from EO to EC. In contrast, this same pattern was apparent over the occipital cortex regardless of the pre-processing scheme. This empirical evidence calls for the development of a standardized data processing protocol for EEG-based analyses of the E/I ratio.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate mechanisms used by the bacterial Vibrio cholerae (Vc) DnaB replicative helicase and the DciA helicase loader. Structural analysis of the ATP-gammas-S form of the VcDnaB-ssDNA complex reveals a configuration distinct from that seen with GDP-AlF4. With ATP-gamma-S, the amino-terminal (NTD) tier, previously found as an open spiral in the GDP-AlF4 complex, adopts a closed planar arrangement. Further, the DnaB subunit at the top of the carboxy-terminal spiral (CTD) tier is displaced by ~25 angstroms between the two forms. We suggest that remodeling the NTD layer between closed planar and open spiral configurations and migration of two distinct CTDs to the top of the DnaB spiral, repeated three times, mediates hand-over-hand translocation. Biochemical analysis suggests that VcDciA leverages its Lasso domain to contact DnaB near its Docking-Linker-Helix interface. Up to three copies of VcDciA bind to VcDnaB and suppress its ATPase activity during loading onto physiological DNA substrates.

We present UniFORM, a non-parametric, Python-based pipeline that uses an automated rigid landmark functional data registration approach for normalizing both feature- and pixel-level MTI data. Designed specifically for the distributional characteristics of MTI datasets, UniFORM operates without prior distributional assumptions and performs robustly regardless of distribution modality, including both unimodal and bimodal patterns.

Benchmarking across three distinct MTI platform datasets demonstrates that UniFORM outperforms existing methods in mitigating batch effects while maintaining biological signal fidelity. This is evidenced by improved marker distribution alignment and positive population preservation, enhanced kBET and Silhouette scores, and improved downstream analyses such as UMAP visualizations and Leiden clustering.

Although recent studies have explored the genetic basis of disease resistance in cattle, comprehensive analyses aimed at identifying the genomic signatures associated with disease-resistance traits in Indian cattle are still unclear. A genome-wide comparison between Bos indicus and Bos taurus could uncover key genomic elements related to disease-resistance traits or immunity. This study aimed to conduct chromosome-by-chromosome analyses among Bos genomes using three pairwise combinations: Bos taurus (Hereford) vs. Bos indicus (Nelore breed), Bos taurus (Hereford) vs. Bos indicus (Gir), and Bos indicus (Nelore) vs. Bos indicus (Gir) to investigate genomic variations focusing in immunity genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Comparative genomic analysis was performed using SyMAP, GSAlign, and SyRI. An in-house Python script was utilized for gene annotation and visualization. Statistical differences in genomic variations among breed pairs were assessed using ANOVA. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were carried out using DAVID for each variant type. The analysis revealed non-syntenic regions associated with four immunity genes in Nelore: VSTM1L, Galectin-9, HDAC5, and POLH. Significant genomic differences were observed on chromosomes 12, 24, 28, 29 and X. Chromosome X of the Nelore lost 50 Mbps of genomic regions compared to Hereford, although all genes remained intact. Further exploration of translocation events on Chromosome X in the Nelore revealed that chromosomes 28 had more single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions, and deletions. In total, 8, 16, and 209 innate immunity genes in Nelore were observed with longer insertions, deletions, and substitutions respectively with 62 genes were had all three variations with statistical significance.

Computational studies suggest that bacterial genomes encode several defence systems, which may act synergistically to enhance phage resistance. However, the regulation, interactions, and ecological roles of these systems in native hosts remain poorly understood. This study explored the role of eight predicted defence systems in the clinical isolate NILS69 of E. coli by testing its susceptibility to 93 phages. Infectivity and adsorption assays using mutants defective in these systems revealed that only PD-T4-3 and RM systems restricted phages able to adsorb. The RM system acted via a predicted Type IV endonuclease and was also able to limit plasmid conjugation if the plasmid was transferred from a donor strain lacking a methylase, which is the hallmark of Type I, II or III RM systems. Other defence systems showed no detectable activity, likely due to phage specificity, environmental regulation, or cofactor requirements.

In Drosophila melanogaster, the S-phase-induced histone genes are repeated in an ~100 copy repeat unit array, whereas in humans, these histone genes are scattered. In both organisms these genes coalesce into Histone Locus Bodies. We used a transgenic histone gene reporter and RNAi in Drosophila to identify canonical H4 histone as a unique repressor of histone synthesis during the G2 phase in germline primary spermatocytes.

Here, we utilize a fluorescence intensity shift assay (FISA) based on the protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) effect to monitor the DNA-CtsR-McsB interactions in real time. Our single-molecule analysis reveals that CtsR binds rapidly and stably to the cognate DNA, and that McsB is able to transiently interact with CtsR in situ of the target DNA. We determine the binding kinetics between McsB and the DNA-bound CtsR by single-molecule real-time binding assays, with kon and koff of 0.75 uM-1 s-1 and 0.34 s-1, respectively. This interaction with McsB does not remove CtsR from the DNA, but lowers the temperature threshold for CtsR dissociation and alters its thermosensing behavior. Mass spectrometry, mutational analysis and structural simulation results together suggest that the phosphorylation of several periphery arginine residues on CtsR, which reduces the binding energy of the CtsR-DNA interaction, underlies a plausible molecular mechanism for this effect. Taken together, these results provide insights into how McsB regulates the CtsR-DNA complex and highlight the functional importance of CtsR periphery arginine residues in the bacterial heat-shock response.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

PXN interacts directly with the C-terminal targeting domain of FAK (FAT) via its intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. This interaction is necessary and sufficient for localizing FAK to focal adhesions. Furthermore, PXN serves as a platform for recruiting other proteins that together control the dynamic changes needed for cell migration and survival. Here, we show that the PXN disordered region undergoes large-scale conformational restriction upon binding to FAT, forming a 48-kDa multi-modal complex consisting of four major interconverting states. Although the complex is flexible, each state has unique sets of contacts involving disordered regions that are both highly represented in ensembles and conserved. Moreover, conserved intramolecular contacts from glutamine-rich regions in PXN contribute to high entropy and thus stability of the FAT bound complex. As PXN is a hub protein, the results provide a structural basis for understanding how perturbations that lead to cellular network rewiring, such as ligand binding and phosphorylation, may lead to shifts in the multi-state equilibrium and phenotypic switching.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

The C. elegans one-cell embryo is polarized along the anterior-posterior axis, with the atypical protein kinase C PKC-3 enriched in the anterior, and the ring finger protein PAR-2 in the posterior. PAR-2 localization is regulated by PKC-3 and the PP1 phosphatases GSP-1/-2. Here, we find that, similar to GSP-2 depletion, depletion of the conserved PP1 interactor SDS-22 results in a partial rescue of the polarity defects of a pkc-3 temperature-sensitive mutant. Consistent with the rescue, SDS-22 depletion or mutation results in reduced GSP 1/ 2 protein levels and activity. The decreased levels of GSP-1/-2 can be rescued by reducing proteasomal activity. Our data suggest that SDS-22 contributes to polarity by protecting the GSP-1 and GSP-2 catalytic subunits from proteasome-mediated degradation, supporting recent data in human cells showing the SDS22 is required to stabilize nascent PP1.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

We sequenced Nf extracellular vesicles (EVs) and identified microRNAs, tRNAs and other small RNAs in Nf-EVs. From these data we selected two prevalent small RNAs as biomarker candidates. We developed an RT-qPCR assay and both small RNAs were detected in Nf-EVs and amoeba-conditioned media. In the mouse model of PAM both small RNA biomarkers were detected in 100% of mouse plasma samples at the end-stage of infection. Notably, smallRNA-1 was detected in the urine of infected mice at timepoints as early as 24h post infection (18/23 mice) and in the plasma as early as 60h post infection (8/8 mice). Additionally, smallRNA-1 was detected in 100% (n=6) of CSF samples from human PAM cases, and in whole blood samples, but not in human plasma from PAM cases. In this study, we discovered small RNAs as biomarkers of Nf infection, one which can be detected reliably in CSF, urine, and whole blood. The RT-qPCR assay is a highly sensitive diagnostic assay that can be conducted in ~3h after receipt of liquid biopsy. The data suggest detection of smallRNA-1 biomarker could provide earlier diagnosis of PAM and be used to monitor biomass of amoebae during treatment.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

K.; Angel, E.; Tahi, F.; Postic, G.", "abstract": "A growing body of evidence shows that the biological activity of RNA molecules is not only due to their primary and secondary structures, but also to their spatial conformation. As the experimental determination of the three-dimensional (3D) structure is a costly and uncertain process, the development of computational methods for predicting RNA fold is a necessity. A critical task for such prediction of the 3D structure consists of finding substructures that can be predicted independently, before being assembled into a global fold. In protein structures, these subparts are the \"structural domains\" and, to the best of our knowledge, no equivalent concept has been defined for RNA macromolecules. In this work, we present RNA3DClust, an adaptation of the Mean Shift clustering algorithm to the RNA 3D structure partitioning problem. This approach allowed us to delimit compact and separate regions in RNA conformations, analogously to the seminal definition of domains in proteins. Benchmarking RNA3DClust required us to create a reference dataset of RNA 3D domain annotations and to devise a new scoring function for assessing the segmentation quality. Importantly, we show that the domain decompositions produced by RNA3DClust may be consistent with those based on RNA biological function and evolution. Finally, the emerging interest in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their likeliness of containing folded regions has motivated us to generate an additional reference dataset of lncRNA predicted conformations. The resulting delineations of 3D domains by RNA3DClust illustrate the potential of our method for analyzing lncRNA structures.

We investigated whether handgrip contraction intensity, duration, and/or impulse would affect tibialis anterior estimates of PICs. Multi-channel electromyograms were recorded from the tibialis anterior of 21 participants (18-40 years), during dorsiflexions at 20% of individual's maximal torque, before and after four handgrip conditions: i) 80%15s, 80% of their maximal handgrip strength sustained for 15s; ii) 40%15s, 40% sustained for 15s; iii) 40%30s, 40% sustained for 30s; and iv) Control (no handgrip). PICs contribution to self-sustained motoneuron firing was estimated with the delta frequency ({Delta}F) using the paired motor unit analysis. The 'brace height', normalised as a percentage of a right triangle (%rTri), was used to quantify the effects of PICs on the non-linearity of firing patterns, representing the neuromodulatory drive (metabotropic regulation of motoneuron excitability) onto the motoneurons. {Delta}F increased by 0.33 pulses per second (pps; 95%CI 0.16-0.49, d=0.47) after 40%30s and by 0.24 pps (0.09-0.38, d=0.34) after 80%15s but remained unchanged after 40%15s and Control.

The increase in PICs contribution to motoneuron firing induced by a remote handgrip contraction is impulse-dependent rather than intensity or duration.

Built-environment professionals (BEPs), who are responsible for local actions, often face criticism for their unwillingness to prioritize biodiversity and are seldom studied from their perspectives, especially those from the Global South. Therefore, understanding the viewpoints of diverse BEPs from both the Global South and North on biodiversity-inclusive urban planning and design (BIPD) is crucial. This study employs Q-Methodology to analyze the perspectives of BEPs in Ethiopia, China, Spain, and the United States, revealing four viewpoints: Pluralist, Enthusiast, Pragmatist, and Contextualist. Challenges in realizing BIPD include widespread unawareness among BEPs of existing biodiversity data and methodologies, structural-physical barriers such as land use conflicts and competing resources, and misaligned values with stakeholders. Our research challenges the notion that BEPs resist incorporating biodiversity into their practices by broadly exploring their viewpoints. BEPs exhibit readiness to transcend legislative structural barriers and leverage professional norms to advocate for urban biodiversity, particularly when equipped with evidence-based tools. Pluralists and Enthusiasts demonstrate heightened interest in multidisciplinary collaboration and prescriptive, visual tools to communicate biodiversity value to stakeholders. Critically, the capacity of BEPs to act hinges on the availability of contextually sensitive methods, necessitating empowerment through transdisciplinary collaborations to foster transformative changes in cities, especially in the Global South, where complex socioeconomic-ecological trade-offs demand co-produced solutions.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Despite their clinical and molecular heterogeneity, spanning supratentorial, posterior fossa, and spinal subtypes, treatment remains limited to surgery and radiotherapy, with chemotherapy offering minimal benefit. Here, we performed transcriptomic analysis of 370 human ependymoma samples and identified two distinct molecular subgroups: EPN-E1 and EPN-E2. The EPN-E1 cluster is enriched for supratentorial tumors harboring ZFTA-RELA fusions (ZFTA-RELAfus), which occur in over 70% of cases and are associated with poor prognosis. To identify targeted therapies for this aggressive subtype, we validated a ZFTA-RELAfus mouse model that recapitulates the human EPN-E1 transcriptome and used it for target discovery. Through Kinome Regularization, a machine learning-driven polypharmacology approach, we identified MERTK as a critical regulator of tumor cell viability. Genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of Mertk reduced cell growth ex vivo, and treatment with a clinical-grade MERTK inhibitor significantly suppressed tumor proliferation in vivo. Both human EPN-E1 tumors and ZFTA-RELAfus mouse tumors exhibited elevated expression of MERTK and its ligand GAS6, and MERTK inhibition led to suppression of pro-survival signaling pathways including MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT. Notably, over 80% of genes upregulated in ZFTA-RELAfus tumors were downregulated following MERTK inhibition, indicating a strong dependency on this pathway for tumor maintenance. These findings define a signaling vulnerability in ZFTA-RELA-driven ependymomas and support the clinical development of MERTK-targeted therapies for patients with the high-risk EPN-E1 subtype.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

However, most existing computational methods rely on similarity, making it difficult to effectively capture the deep semantic information among heterogeneous nodes in complex networks. In addition, the inherent 'black-box' nature of traditional deep learning models leads to a lack of transparency in their decision-making process. Therefore, we propose an interpretable MDA prediction method (iDRKAN) based on dual-graph representation learning and Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. First, iDRKAN constructs similarity views and meta-path views based on the similarity matrix and association matrix respectively, and learns higher-order feature representation of each view by graph convolutional network (GCN). Subsequently, the multi-channel attention (MCA) mechanism is introduced to adaptively fuse the contextual information of each similarity view in different convolutional layers, and the semantic layer attention (SLA) mechanism is used to integrate the semantic information contained in different meta-path views. Next, the contrastive learning strategy is used to optimize the consistency between the dual-graph representation. Finally, the dual-graph features are weighted fused, and fed into the interpretable Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for prediction. Experimental results on two public datasets show that iDRKAN significantly outperforms existing computational approaches in multiple performance indicators. In addition, experiments with different classifiers verify that iDRKAN achieves a good balance between prediction performance and interpretability. The case study further demonstrates the effectiveness of iDRKAN in mining potential associations.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

In BALB/c mice, adaptation favored nonsynonymous substitutions linked to increased virulence, including a hemagglutinin variant exclusively fixed in female lineages. It also revealed the first demonstration of sex-dependent selection shaping a viral protein interface. In female-adapted viruses, substitutions disrupting a key NS1 dimerization motif converged on a single residue, while in male-adapted viruses, they were dispersed across the same interface. Conversely, adaptation to C57BL/6 resulted in fewer substitutions but promoted defective viral genome formation, leading to reduced cytopathic effect and attenuated virulence. This provides the first in vivo evidence that host genotype alone can modulate defective viral genome formation.

To that end, highly inbred lines (F=0.99999997) of the freshwater snail Physa acuta were used to produce individuals with varying levels of parental relatedness (self-fertilization, sibling crosses, and cousin crosses), though with identical genomic heterozygosity. Several fitness traits declined significantly with increasing parental relatedness, a pattern characteristic of ID, and quantitatively representing a non-negligible fraction of the ID usually observed in natural, genetically diverse populations of Physa acuta. Individual-based simulations showed that mutation rates compatible with values of ID found in natural populations are way too low to generate as much ID as observed in our experiment.

Achieving the necessary amplification of this signaling is essential for successful GTH-dependent folliculogenesis, yet the mechanisms remain inadequately defined. Our study utilizes single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to identify FOSL2 as an FSH-inducible transcription factor, exhibiting precise spatiotemporal co-expression with FSHR. FOSL2 knockdown in vitro resulted in notable reductions in granulosa cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and disrupted gonadotropin-dependent folliculogenesis. In vivo studies using conditional FOSL2 deletion in mouse granulosa cells corroborated these results, demonstrating a complete halt in GTH-dependent folliculogenesis and resultant infertility. Mechanistic exploration unveiled that FSH/FSHR initiates FOSL2 expression via the cAMP/PKA/CREB cascade, while FOSL2 in turn enhances FSHR transcription through direct promoter binding, thereby establishing a self-amplifying loop. This loop represents a molecular switch, modeled to the all-or-nothing dynamics of GTH-dependent folliculogenesis. The evolutionary conservation of this mechanism was confirmed through cross-species analyses in sheep, where FOSL2 deficiency similarly attenuated FSH/FSHR signaling and inhibited follicular growth.

Through allosteric coupling, GPCRs transduce extracellular stimuli into physiologically-relevant intracellular signaling cascades via G proteins and {beta}-arrestin ({beta}arr). The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is a rhodopsin-like, peptide hormone GPCR considered a promising target for both metabolic and neurological diseases. Here, by characterizing an ultra-rare coding variant in intracellular loop-2 (ICL2) of the GHSR, GHSR-L149P (L149P), we establish a unique role of ICL2 in GPCR biased signaling, lipid modulation, and intracellular trafficking. Using an array of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assays, we show that the natural L149P mutant exhibits (i) a constitutive plasma membrane [PM] expression bias, (ii) preferential partitioning away from cholesterol-enriched PM microdomains, (iii) enhanced agonist-directed endocytosis, and (iv) dramatic signaling bias towards {beta}arr1/2 over Gq, Gi/o, and G12/13. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic tools, we demonstrate that {beta}arr1/2 recruitment to L149P requires G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2/3 (GRK2/3)-mediated phosphorylation, but it does not utilize protein kinase C (PKC), G{beta}{gamma}-dependent GRK2/3 translocation, or Gi/o, supporting a G protein-independent mechanism. Lastly, we found that {beta}arr1/2 recruitment to L149P requires both GRK2/3 and GRK5/6, while the wild-type GHSR relies exclusively on GRK2/3, consistent with increased GRK6 pre-coupling to the L149P mutant.

Plexins stand out because they can directly bind with both Rho and Ras-family small GTPases through their intracellular domains when these GTPases are in their active, GTP-bound states. This binding occurs via intracellular regions which include a Rho-GTPase Binding Domain (RBD) and a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) segment. Studies have shown that Rho and Ras GTPases play vital roles in plexin signaling and activation. However, the structural dynamics of plexins and GTPases and how these conformational changes affect interactions when plexin is bound with both Ras and Rho-GTPases or bound to only one specific GTPase has remained unclear. In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on six distinct plexin-GTPase bound systems to investigate the differences in conformations and dynamics between Plexin-B1 and three GTPases: Rap1b, Rnd1, and Rac1. Our analysis revealed that dynamics with Rac1 are more altered, compared to Rnd1, depending on whether the plexin GAP domain is bound or unbound to Rap1b. In addition, we further investigated alterations in network centralities and compared the network dynamics of the Plexin-GTPases complexes, focusing on the differences when Plexin is bound to both Ras (Rap1b) and Rho-GTPases (Rnd1/Rac1) versus when it is bound to only one GTPase. Our study revealed that Rnd1 exhibits stronger and more stable interactions with Plexin-B1 in the absence of Rap1b, while Rac1 shows fewer and less stable connections in comparison. These computational models have features that broadly agree with experimental results from hydrogen-deuterium exchange detected by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Such insights provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Plexin-GTPase interactions and the complexities of signaling mechanisms involving GTPases in general.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Both structural and functional properties vary sharply throughout the human V1 map. Despite large variation, underlying constancies computed from the covariation pattern of V1 properties have been proposed. Such constancies would imply that V1 is composed of multiple identical units whose visual properties differ only due to differences in their inputs. To test this, we used fMRI to investigate how V1 cortical magnification and preferred spatial frequency covary across eccentricity and polar angle, measured in 40 observers. V1 cortical magnification and preferred spatial frequency were strongly correlated across eccentricity and around polar angle, however their relation differed between these dimensions: they were proportional across eccentricity but not polar angle. The constant ratio of cortical magnification to preferred spatial frequency when measured as a function of eccentricity suggests a shared underlying cause of variation in the two properties, e.g., the gradient of retinal ganglion cell density across eccentricity. In contrast, the deviation from proportionality around polar angle implies that cortical variation differs from that in retina along this dimension. Thus, a constancy hypothesis is supported for one of the two spatial dimensions of V1, highlighting the importance of examining the full 2D-map to understand how V1 is organized.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

However, the heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics of CD4+ T cell responses in VL remain poorly defined. In this study, we use a model of experimental VL with tissue-specific immunity and single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a high-resolution assessment of CD4+ T cell responses. Our analysis reveals the complexity of CD4+ T cell differentiation in VL, identifying distinct Th1 subsets with transcriptional heterogeneity that may reflect functional specialisation. Despite minimal transcriptional differences between splenic and hepatic CD4+ T cells, we identified shifts in subset composition, including the emergence of a stem-like CD4+ T cell population in the spleen, which was suppressed by the transcription factor Bhlhe40. Bhlhe40 deficiency skewed CD4+ T cell differentiation, impairing Th1 responses while promoting Tr1 cells, resulting in defective parasite control in the liver. Additionally, AmBisome treatment induced a profound transcriptional shift in CD4+ T cells, leading to the maintenance of stem-like CD4+ T cells in the spleen and the expansion of tissue resident memory-like cells in the liver. These findings uncover key regulatory mechanisms that shape CD4+ T cell differentiation in VL and provide insights into how immune-modulatory strategies could enhance long-term immunity.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

While short-read sequencing (Illumina, etc.) offers high base accuracy and cost efficiency, it struggles with structural variation (SV) detection and complex genomic regions. In contrast, long-read sequencing (PacBio HiFi) excels in resolving large SVs and repetitive sequences but is limited by throughput, higher Indel error rates, and sequencing costs. Hybrid approaches may combine these technologies and leverage their complementary strengths and different sources of error to provide higher accuracy, more comprehensive results, and higher throughput by lowering the coverage requirement for the long reads. Methods: This study benchmarks the DNAscope Hybrid pipeline, a novel integrated alignment and variant calling framework that combines short- and long-read data sequenced from the same sample. We evaluate its performance across multiple human genome reference datasets (HG002-HG004) using the draft Q100 and Genome in a Bottle v4.2.1 benchmarks. The pipeline's ability to detect small variants (SNPs/Indels), structural variants (SVs), and copy number variations (CNVs) is assessed using data from the Illumina and Pacbio sequencing systems at varying read depths (5x-30x). Benchmark results are compared to DeepVariant. Results: The DNAscope Hybrid pipeline significantly improves SNP and Indel calling accuracy, particularly in complex genomic regions. At lower long-read depths (e.g., 5x-10x), the hybrid approach outperforms standalone short- or long-read pipelines at full sequencing depths (30x-35x). Additionally, the DNAscope Hybrid outperforms leading open-source tools for SV and CNV detection, enhancing variant discovery in challenging genomic regions. The pipeline also demonstrates clinical utility by identifying disease-associated variants. Moreover, DNAscope Hybrid is highly efficient, achieving less than 90 minutes runtimes at single standard instance. Conclusion: The DNAscope Hybrid pipeline is a computationally efficient, highly accurate variant calling framework that leverages the advantages of both short- and long-read sequencing. By improving variant detection in challenging genomic regions and offering a robust solution for clinical and large-scale genomic applications, it holds significant promise for genetic disease diagnostics, population-scale studies, and personalized medicine.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

In the presence of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus adopts a survival lifestyle similar to previously described intracellular S. aureus persisters, downregulating nitrogen metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis, while upregulating protein maturation processes. Entrance in a viable but non culturable state is the primary survival strategy of S. aureus in response to vancomycin treatment, whereas only a minority of the S. aureus population survive ciprofloxacin treatment while in a viable but non culturable state.

A wide variety of epistasis detection tools are currently available with several studies comparing the performance of methods suitable for case-control data. However, there is limited understanding of how well these tools perform with quantitative phenotypes. Methods We identified six epistasis detection methods suitable for quantitative phenotype data: EpiSNP, Matrix Epistasis, MIDESP, PLINK Epistasis, QMDR, and REMMA. To evaluate these tools, we generated simulated datasets using EpiGEN. The datasets modeled various pairwise interactions between disease-associated SNPs, including dominant, multiplicative, recessive, and XOR interactions. Additionally, we assessed the BOOST and MDR algorithms on discretized (case-control) version of the datasets. These tools were then tested on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset for the externalizing behavior phenotype. Results Each tool exhibited strong performance for certain interaction types, but weaker performance for others. MDR achieved the highest overall detection rate of 60%, while EpiSNP had the lowest overall detection rate of 7%. MDR and MIDESP performed best at detecting multiplicative interactions with detection rates of 54% and 41% respectively. Both MDR and MIDESP were also effective at detecting XOR interactions with detection rates of 84% and 50% respectively. PLINK Epistasis, Matrix Epistasis, and REMMA excelled at detecting dominant interactions, all achieving a 100% detection rate. On the other hand, EpiSNP was particularly effective at detecting recessive interactions with a detection rate of 66%. When analyzing the ABCD dataset, Plink Epistasis and Plink BOOST identified SNPs within the DRD2 and DRD4 genes, which have been previously linked to externalizing behavior. Conclusion Since no single method consistently outperforms others across all types of epistasis, and given that the specific types of epistasis present in a dataset are often unknown, it may be more effective to use multiple epistasis detection algorithms in combination to obtain comprehensive results.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate how environmental pH influences Salmonella's preference for its endogenous siderophores versus exogenous siderophores within the physiological range of the gastrointestinal tract. Through competition assays, gene expression analysis, and siderophore quantification, we demonstrate that Salmonella increasingly relies on exogenous siderophores under acidic conditions. This shift is attributed to reduced production of its endogenous siderophores, enterobactin and salmochelin. Deletion of the sigma factor RpoS enhances endogenous siderophore production and iron acquisition at low pH, suggesting its role in regulating iron homeostasis. Our findings reveal a pH-dependent adaptation in Salmonella's iron acquisition strategy, highlighting the pathogen's versatility in nutrient acquisition across varying gastrointestinal conditions.

This study evaluated the spatial distribution of feral dogs and their impacts on native species, including guanacos (Lama guanicoe), upland geese (Chloephaga picta), and flightless steamer ducks (Tachyeres pteneres). Presence-only data collected during two field expeditions were analysed using species distribution models (MaxEnt) to predict habitat suitability for feral dogs and guanacos. Habitat connectivity analyses identified at least two potentially isolated feral dog populations. Using generalised linear and non-linear models, we assessed the ecological impacts of feral dogs, finding significant habitat overlap with guanacos, particularly in central areas of the island. This overlap corresponded to a reduced likelihood of guanaco occurrence, suggesting behavioural adaptations to disturbance and predation pressure. Upland geese exhibited a negative association with both actual and predicted feral dog presence, while flightless steamer ducks appeared unaffected. Furthermore, NDVI changes observed on Navarino Island compared to Torres del Paine, where no invasive species are present, are likely linked to the spread of invasive species and the decline of guanacos in the Magellanic forest, highlighting the cascading ecological consequences of feral dog invasion.

Two conserved genes, clsA and clsB, encode putative cardiolipin synthases that have been linked to bile acid tolerance, but their physiological roles remain undefined. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Bacteroides spp. ClsA and ClsB diverge from the well-characterized cardiolipin synthases of Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Here, we show that these enzymes have distinct cardiolipin synthase activities and make non-redundant contributions to B. fragilis fitness under gut-relevant stress conditions, including osmotic stress, disruption of membrane potential, and exposure to the bile acid deoxycholate. Although deoxycholate treatment perturbed K/Na homeostasis in B. fragilis, deletion of clsA or clsB did not significantly alter intracellular ion levels, suggesting that cardiolipin loss does not substantially impact ion balance under standard cultivation conditions. High-resolution lipidomic analyses showed that cardiolipin comprises less than 1% of B. fragilis membranes and that ClsA and ClsB produce distinct cardiolipin products with unique acyl chain lengths and levels of unsaturation. Deletion of either cls gene led to Cls-specific remodeling of B. fragilis envelope lipid content, which was also associated with shifts in non-lipid metabolites indicative of stress-induced metabolic changes. These results define distinct roles for ClsA and ClsB in shaping B. fragilis membrane composition, metabolism, and stress resilience, and highlight cardiolipin as a key determinant of fitness under bile acid stress.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

This unexpected result emerges from a widespread physiological response across diverse microbial taxa, in which more complex environments trigger higher overall resource uptake. This intensifies competition and drives biodiversity loss. Updating a central ecological model to include this physiological trait accurately reproduces the observed decline.

Here, we introduce two complementary approaches--a locus-specific massively parallel reporter assay (LS-MPRA) and a degenerate MPRA (d-MPRA)--specifically designed to address some of these shortcomings. LS-MPRA leverages bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to generate high-complexity libraries spanning large genomic regions, enabling unbiased interrogation of millions of DNA fragments potentially relevant for the regulation of a specific gene or set of genes. The d-MPRA employs systematic mutagenesis to resolve the functional architecture of CRMs at nucleotide resolution, thereby nominating critical nucleotides as potential TF binding sites, or for other regulatory roles. We applied these methods to retinal genes that are stably expressed in differentiated cells of the retina, in rod photoreceptors and in subsets of bipolar interneurons, using both in vivo and ex vivo preparations of mouse tissue. LS-MPRA recapitulated some of the known CRMs for these genes?such as the proximal promoter region of Rho--and identified potentially novel CRMs, including those located within neighboring genes. The method was then applied to a gene that is dynamically expressed in subsets of retinal progenitor cells, Olig2, where it identified three distinct CRM regions (Olig2-NR1, NR2, and NR3). D-MPRA and subsequent motif analyses nominated critical TF binding sites within these regions. CUT&RUN experiments confirmed direct binding of these candidates. Moreover, extending LS-MPRA to chick retina and spinal cord demonstrated the applicability of these methods across species and tissues. Together, the integrated LS-MPRA and d-MPRA strategies provide a robust, high-resolution platform for discovery of the cis-regulatory code underlying tissue-specific gene expression. It does not require prior knowledge of potential CRMs, and is quite rapid and straightforward to deploy, using typical molecular biology methods. The fragment size can be scaled to create short CRMs, e.g. for cell type-specific expression within viral vectors. It should enable CRM discovery at a scale and affordability for laboratories wishing to focus on a particular locus or set of loci.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Studying Amoebozoa not only helps to illuminate Opisthokont evolution but also reveals the mechanisms that have driven their ecological success. Here we report the discovery of Apostamoeba explorator strain BEAP0066, representing a novel lineage within Amoebozoa with intriguing behaviors like the \"double-amoeba\", a behavior characterized by the bipolarization of a cell into two poles that coexist and act as two semi-independent cells; and the \"colonizing rings\", the generation of a front of amoebae advancing together and grazing on bacterial mats.

These findings suggest that retention of gene function composition, rather than gene loss, played a key role in shaping Amoebozoa evolution.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale.

R.", "abstract": "Background Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative condition, is characterized by significant cognitive decline. To detect these changes, diagnostic imaging approaches rely primarily on single modalities to identify structural and functional changes, thus hindering patient stratification and treatment effectiveness. Recent studies suggest the brain undergoes anatomical and functional restructuring, resulting in neuro-metabolic and vascular dysregulation (MVD) prior amyloid-{beta}; accumulation. Several lines of evidence suggest that MVD begins at an early age and leads to the onset of AD. Therefore, we hypothesized that detecting MVD may serve as a sensitive and early noninvasive diagnostic tool, and was assessed in a retrospective clinical population from CN to AD. Methods A total of 403 subjects with 18F-FDG PET (FDG), and ASL MRI scanned within 180 days from ADNI 2 and 3 were included, where: CN/EMCI/MCI/LMCI/AD(95/71/112/42/83), M/F(55/45%). CBF images were generated from ASL images using ExploreASL. CBF and FDG images were used to evaluate cerebral perfusion and metabolism, respectively, and were registered to the MNI152+ atlas. Mean intensities across 59 brain regions were ratioed with whole brain mean values. z-scores were computed for disease subjects relative to a reference and projected onto a Cartesian space. Results were aligned with transcriptomic signatures and clinical cognitive assessments. Findings Our findings suggest that disease progression follows a stage-dependent MVD pattern that can identify at-risk brain regions. Although each region progresses at a different pace, regions related to memory, cognitive tasks, and motor function showed significant early dysregulation. Importantly, these changes aligned with transcriptomic and cognitive signatures. Interpretation We identified an MVD pattern that at-risk brain regions follow across the AD spectrum. In addition, our study shows that MVD in brain regions varies by sex and disease stage, making it a sensitive tool for early AD diagnosis. Moreover, this could improve patient monitoring, stratification, and therapeutic testing.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Axonal regrowth through the anastomosis makes it possible to restore facial motor skills, which become spontaneous after physiotherapy. This suggests cerebral plasticity. Objective: We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a pilot study to test this hypothesis. Methods: Twenty-one healthy volunteers (CTRL) and 12 patients after HFA performed 5 motor tasks with MEG and electromyographic recordings: eyelid closure, smile, tongue protraction, mastication and thumb flexion. For each task, we picked the location of the maximum source activity within the precentral gyrus. We calculated the distances between this location and the vertex for each task and a somatotopy index. Results: There was an interaction between the participant group and the task (F(4,124)=4.07, p=0.0039). In CTRL, the maximum source location was statistically different between smile and tongue tasks and between eyelid and tongue tasks (p<0.001). No such difference was observed in HFA (p=1.000). 90.5% of CTRL and 41.7% of HFA showed a normal somatotopy (p=0.0046). Conclusions: In CTRL, the organization of the cortical motor areas was similar to that of Penfield motor Homunculus.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study, healthy volunteers received subanesthetic doses of ketamine and thiopental during an EEG oddball task. These drugs have opposite effects on E/I balance but comparable sedative profiles. Ketamine reduced the PSD exponent, while thiopental increased it, consistent with computational predictions.

Here, we developed an mRNA vaccine expressing a stabilized spike protein derived from OC43 and tested its efficacy in different challenge models in C57BL/6 mice. This novel OC43 vaccine elicited OC43-specific immune responses, as well as cross-reactive immune response against other embecoviruses, including HKU1 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). Interestingly, this OC43 vaccine protected mice not only against a lethal OC43 infection, but also against MHV-A59, which is only 65% matched.

An immunotherapeutic vaccine would be an excellent tool to treat infections and prevent chronic cardiac disease in this host. Building on previous pre-clinical studies, we performed here the first randomized field trial of a vaccine against T. cruzi among client-owned dogs with natural infections. Methods A total of 31 dogs with T. cruzi infection with diverse parasite strains were enrolled and received three doses of a vaccine composed of Tc24-C4 and TSA1-C4 recombinant proteins with MPLA (N=16) or saline control (N=15) and followed for up to six months to assess efficacy. Results Blood parasite burden and electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings as primary outcomes showed that therapeutic vaccination led to a significant decrease in parasite burden, prevented/stopped cardiac alterations and was safe. This clinical benefit was mediated by major changes in T cell activation and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, while antibody responses were minimally affected. In addition, vaccination also reprogrammed the ongoing trained immunity to reduce inflammation, suggesting a complex interplay between innate and T cells in its mechanism of action. Conclusions These results provide a strong support for the further development of a veterinary vaccine based on these antigens as well as a human therapeutic vaccine to prevent the progression of chronic cardiac disease from T. cruzi infection.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Syzygium luehmannii is not known to be highly susceptible to the parasitic fungus causing myrtle rust, Austropuccinia psidii, however infections have been reported in the field, and in controlled inoculations. The capacity for this exotic pathogen to parasitise host trees, suggest that molecular targets are present in susceptible plants. While understanding resistance phenotypes is important for tree breeding and management, determining the key drivers for susceptibility may also provide useful additional research targets to avert infection. While there are several genome resources for plants within the large and globally diverse Syzygium genus, there is no diploid genome assembly (2n = 22), and no genome for S. luehmannii. We assembled the genome for S. luehmannii into the pseudo-phased, 11 chromosome pairs here termed haplotype A (370 Mbp) and B (357 Mbp). We annotated the predicted protein coding genes, and we specifically annotated the nucleotide-binding leucine rich repeat (NLR) type resistance genes as a useful resource for plant:pathogen studies.

Objectives: We aimed to examine whether DNA-methylation at birth and childhood is associated with lung function growth. Methods: We measured DNA-methylation in leukocytes from participants in two childhood asthma cohorts (CAMP [n=703, mean-age 12.9 years] and GACRS [n=788, mean-age 9.3 years]) and cord blood from participants in the VDAART study (n=572) to identify CpGs and pathways associated with lung function. Results: We identified 1,049 consistent differentially methylated CpGs (608 relatively hypermethylated) across all three studies (FDR-P<0.05). Relatively hypomethylated CpGs were enriched for gluconeogenesis, cell adhesion and VEGF signaling. Relatively hypermethylated CpGs were enriched for Hippo, B-cell and growth hormone receptor signaling. Functional enrichment suggested potential regulatory roles for active enhancers and histone modifications. Additionally, enrichment in PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways in males and enrichment in hormonal pathways in females was identified. Gaussian graphical models identified sex-differential DNA-methylation nodes and hub scores at birth and childhood. Integrating with previously identified polygenic risk scores for asthma and drug-target enrichment identified seven robust genes including MPO, CHCHD3, CACNA1S, PI4KA, EP400, CREBBP and KCNA10 with known associations as biomarkers for asthma severity and drug targets for airway inflammation.

In this study, we compiled available human chimeric read data, each comprising a microRNA or isomiR segment paired with an mRNA fragment and identified 1,747 isomiRs and over 5 million microRNA/isomiR-mRNA interactions. We observed that microRNAs with higher adenine and thymine content, and lower cytosine content, tend to have more isomiRs and more mRNA targets. Notably, an average of 18.9% of mRNA targets were bound exclusively by isomiRs, not by their microRNA counterparts. Furthermore, isomiRs sharing the same seed sequences as their reference miRNAs may bind to different targets from their miRNAs, highlighting functional divergence. Interestingly, 20.0% of microRNAs and 8.2% of isomiRs appear to bind mRNAs independently of their seed regions.

Phosphorylation of I{kappa}B proteins by IKK results in their degradation and consequent activation of NF-{kappa}B transcription factors. RIPK1, a critical cell death regulator, is also a direct target of IKK kinase activity, thereby repressing its cell death activity. In {beta} T cells, the RIPK1 kinase activity of IKK is critical for normal thymic development while mature {beta} T cells require IKK for both activation of NF-{kappa}B dependent survival programmes, and repression of RIPK1. {gamma}{delta} T cells play a unique and versatile role in host immunity with specific effector functions that enables them to act as early responders in immune defense. The role of IKK regulated pathways in their development and survival is not known. Here, we use mouse genetics to dissect the function of IKK and downstream pathways in the normal homeostasis of {gamma}{delta} T cells. We find that IKK expression is critical to establish a replete {gamma}{delta} T cell compartment, but that requires vary between different subsets. Type 1 {gamma}{delta} T cells require IKK dependent NF-{kappa}B activation for their generation, while IKK is redundant for development of adaptive {gamma}{delta} T cells. Instead, IKK dependent NF-{kappa}B activation is required for their longterm survival. We also find evidence that IKK repression of RIPK1 is required for survival of peripheral but not thymic {gamma}{delta} T cells. Ablation of CASPASE8 did not rescue {gamma}{delta} T cells in the absence of IKK but rather revealed a potent sensitivity of all {gamma}{delta} subsets to necroptosis, that was rescued by kinase dead RIPK1. Overall, we reveal critical requirements for IKK regulated inflammatory pathways by {gamma}{delta} T cells that contrast with those of {beta} T cells, and between different subsets, highlighting the complexity of the regulation of these pathways in the adaptive immune system.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Despite accumulation of numerous mRNAs including those encoding key developmental regulators, overt embryonic phenotypes are absent in pnrc2 mutants. Our previous work suggested that accumulated mRNAs are not translated in pnrc2 mutants, though the underlying mechanism(s) was unknown. We show here that many overexpressed transcripts in pnrc2 mutants have shortened poly(A) tails and are disengaged from ribosomes, and that deadenylation inhibition leads to somite defects in pnrc2 mutants. In contrast, transcripts encoding the P-body protein, Ddx61, are both overexpressed and engaged with ribosomes, leading to an increase in Ddx61 protein. Co-depletion of Ddx61 and its ohnolog Ddx6 enhances her1 accumulation and later leads to strong morphological defects in pnrc2 mutants.

The species was thought to be extinct for ~90 years before it was rediscovered at American Camp, San Juan Island National Historical Park in 1998. Here, we report the results of the first population genetic analyses for insulanus, using DNA collected non-invasively from individuals in the last known stronghold for the species. We used DNA extracted from meconium, larval exuviae, and natural mortalities to generate and test thirteen new microsatellite markers to estimate genetic diversity, population structure, and kinship. We assembled and annotated mitochondrial genomes, which were used alongside museum specimens of insulanus collected ~100 years ago from Vancouver Island, and other members of the E. ausonides species complex, to infer the evolutionary history of the species. The results indicated that insulanus experiences low heterozygosity, a small effective population size (Ne), and low allelic diversity. High levels of inbreeding were found in some individuals, but inbreeding was uneven across the population. No population structure or partitioning of genetic variation by host plant was detected. The mitogenomes of extant insulanus were all identical and modern samples showed a loss of allelic diversity compared to insulanus from museums.

While infected hosts mount an immune response in an attempt to eliminate the parasitoid egg, parasitoid venom proteins act to inhibit these host immune responses and manipulate host physiology to ensure infection success. A key immune suppressive venom protein in G. hookeri is a venom-specific isoform of the SERCA (Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase) calcium pump. However, SERCA is a large hydrophobic protein, and the mechanism by which it and other venom proteins are transported into the host is not well understood. We used a variety of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to assess the properties of G. hookeri venom. Electronic microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed the presence of venom vesicles as a putative transport mechanism. We used tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) to biophysically characterize these vesicles, and our TRPS data suggest G. hookeri venom is composed of multiple vesicle types that are distinguishable by size, zeta potential, and density. Finally, we fluorescently labeled venom vesicles to test for entry into host immune cells. We observed that these vesicles interact with immune cells membranes and are internalized into the cell.

In this study, we aimed to identify novel lncRNAs and characterize their interaction with mRNAs during different stages of dengue infection using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to better understand their role in dengue pathogenesis. Methods: We analyzed RNA-seq data (GSE94892) obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 39 dengue-infected patients. RNA-seq data analysis was performed using the Tuxedo protocol, and the coding potential of novel transcripts was examined using CPC and CPAT tools. LncRNAs and cis-regulated mRNAs were identified through location-expression analysis within a 20 kbp genomic region surrounding the identified lncRNAs. Results: We identified and characterized a total of 65 novel lncRNAs differentially expressed during dengue disease progression. These included 34 long intergenic lncRNAs, 2 antisense lncRNAs, and 25 alternatively spliced lncRNAs classified based on their localization. Bioinformatics analysis predicted potential cis-regulated target genes. Co-expression analysis revealed a strong correlation between lncRNAs and genes enriched in pathways related to megakaryocyte development and platelet production, suggesting a potential role in dengue pathogenesis. Furthermore, comparison with miRBase-21 indicated that some of the identified lncRNAs could act as miRNA precursors, highlighting a novel function of lncRNAs in gene regulation. Conclusion: We developed an analytical pipeline to identify novel lncRNAs from RNA-seq data. Our analyses led to the identification of novel lncRNAs and their associated genes involved in dengue disease progression. These findings provide insights into the functional role of lncRNAs in dengue pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

However, their application is typically limited to small-scale studies involving individual or a few dozen samples, as a consequence of costs and experimental requirement.

However, the cellular resolution is lost and only a complex linear combination of signals from multiple cells is observed. Thus, gene expression changes cannot be attributed to individual cells or cell populations. Cell-type deconvolution methods infer cellular compositions from bulk transcriptomics data. State-of-the-art approaches use single-cell data to build molecular reference profiles and identify powerful cell-type markers for improved deconvolution. In this context, we propose Dynamic celltype deconvolution ensembles for Mapping in mixed Conditions (DynaMiCs) for the integration of single-cell and bulk transcriptomics data. Specifically, DynaMiCs dynamically extracts information from single-cell experiments to (1) provide more accurate estimates of cellular compositions, and (2) establish a mapping between bulk and single-cell data. Consequently, DynaMiCs enables the investigation of how cell populations change in both quantity and molecular characteristics between different phenotypes, informed by single-cell experiments.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Cellular and molecular analysis by single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed a significant shift in distal lung epithelium towards proximal epithelial phenotype. Importantly, a histopathological pattern of bronchiolization encompassing divergent atypical epithelial cells and KRT17+/TP63+/KRT5low basaloid-like cells was present in the distal fibrotic lung lesions.

Further, immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated KRT7 and KRT8 populations reside overlaying the ACTA2-positive myofibroblasts in fibrotic foci, implying their pro-fibrogenic activity similar to human IPF lungs.

Chronic liver disease is one of the major clinical manifestations in patients and impacts quality of life and survival. However, the pathophysiology of liver disease is ZSD remains largely unknown, and current interventions are limited. To further study the liver disease mechanism, we use the PEX1-Gly844Asp (G844D) mouse model for mild ZSD, which was previously shown to develop hepatomegaly and cholestasis, similar to ZSD patients. Methods: The natural history of hepatopathy was broadly characterized in PEX1-G844D mice and littermate controls from 1 to 18 months of age using liver histology, electron microscopy, cultured hepatocytes and blood. Metabolite and mechanism analysis included liver functions, respiratory chain dynamics, lipidomics, peroxisome metabolites, gene and protein expression assays. Results: PEX1-G844D mice featured liver disease progression from hepatomegaly (1 month) to cluster cell death (4 months), hepatosteatosis (6 months), inflammation (8 months), fibrosis, and hepatic cancer (12 and 15 months). Hepatocyte proliferation and reduced glycogen was observed across all ages. Measurement of peroxisomal functions showed defective peroxisomal import and secondary mitochondrial defects in cultured hepatocytes. In blood and liver, plasmalogens were decreased, and C26:0 lyso-phosphatidylcholine and C27 bile acid intermediates were elevated. In liver, we observed accumulation of triglycerides and cholesterol, and reduced membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids. In contrast, in serum we observed reduced triglycerides, cholesterol and membrane lipids. Gene expression profiles confirmed by immunoblotting supported reduced hepatic de novo lipogenesis, increased hepatic lipid uptake and oxidation, PPAR activation, and modulated glucose and glycogen metabolism. Liver X receptor agonist (T0901317) applied to cultured hepatocytes enhanced hepatic lipogenesis and lipid secretion, but aggravated steatosis. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggested the following mechanisms of hepatopathy progression. We propose that global peroxisome dysfunction (1) causes PPAR activation, leading to chronic hyperplasia and partially contributing to disrupted hepatic lipid homeostasis with hepatosteatosis, and (2) underlies chronic hypoglycemia, causing hypoinsulinemia and contributing to reduced hepatic lipogenesis and systemic lipid deficiency. Growth restriction in the mouse model and in ZSD patients could be attributable to systemic lipid deficiency. Our mechanistic delineation of the pathophysiology provides other additional novel potential therapeutic targets to halt liver disease in ZSD.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) AngII and TNF activate NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) to produce superoxide. TNF receptors associate with Nox1 and Leucine Rich Repeat Containing 8A (LRRC8A) anion channels to modulate inflammation, as well as contractility in a RhoA-dependent manner. VSMC-specific LRRC8A knockout (KO) mesenteric arteries are protected from TNF-induced injury and vasodilated better. We hypothesized that LRRC8A KO would preserve vascular function and decrease blood pressure (BP) in AngII-infused mice. Wild type (WT) and LRRC8A KO mice received AngII infusions for 14 days. Systolic BP was not different, but KO mice had more BP \"dipping\" during inactive periods and dipping was preserved after AngII. Contraction of KO mesenteric vessels to AngII itself was not altered, however after AngII exposure the function of KO aortic and mesenteric vessels was less impaired as reflected by less augmented contraction to norepinephrine and serotonin and preserved relaxation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Western blotting revealed increased soluble guanylate cyclase alpha and reduced CPI-17 in hypertensive KO aortae. Consistent with the presence of lower Rho kinase activity in KO VSMCs, phosphorylation of Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (ERM) and Cofilin was reduced. Aortic wall/lumen was not different between hypertensive WT and KO mice, but AngII caused less proliferation (lower PCNA), and less induction of antioxidant enzymes and senescence markers in KO vessels. Thus, while AngII-induced contraction does not require LRRC8A, these channels support the associated inflammatory response which modifies BP dipping.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

S.; H, S.; Surendran, S.; Tasnim, N.; Babu, K.", "abstract": "Locomotion is essential for executing most behaviours. In Caenorhabditis elegans. Efficient locomotion is exhibited as a result of the coordination of excitatory and inhibitory signals from the nervous system onto the body-wall muscles. Although neurotransmitters play a vital role in maintaining and executing coordinated movements, neuropeptides have emerged as important players in the regulation and sustenance of locomotory states. In our previous study we explored the role of the neuropeptide FLP-15 in regulating reversal frequency during foraging behaviour in C. elegans. We were also interested in exploring other possible locomotory defects in flp-15 mutant animals. In this work we show that flp-15 mutants show an increased length of reversals during foraging resulting in defects in maintaining the direction of reversals. Mutants in flp-15 exhibited a floral pattern of reversals as opposed to near linear patterns of reversal in wild-type control animals. We further show that the defect in maintaining the direction of reversals could be due to increased amplitude of the body-bends with flp-15 mutants showing a large increase in the mean amplitude of body-bends. Our data suggests that FLP-15 partially functions through the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), NPR-3, to regulates the amplitude of body-bends. Finally, we show that loss of flp-15 leads to an increase in the expression of another neuropeptide, NLP-12, whose over expression has been implicated in causing increased amplitude of body-bends allowing us to speculate that the regulation of NLP-12 by FLP-15 may allow for the observed locomotory defects in flp-15 mutant animals.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Reversal learning offers a window into how associations are acquired, updated, and overwritten. Because olfactory inputs bypass much of the thalamus and are tightly linked to emotion, we examined whether humans can flexibly form and subsequently reverse aversive associations to smells. Thirty healthy adults underwent an olfactory reversal conditioning protocol in which one neutral odor (CS+) was followed by a 90 dB aversive sound (US) and a second odor (CS-) was not. After five blocks the contingencies were reversed. Throughout 300 trials we collected ratings of pleasantness and intensity together with autonomic physiological indices (skin conductance, ECG, photoplethysmography, respiration), facial EMG, and 64-channel EEG. Contrary to expectations, pleasantness, intensity, and all autonomic or facial muscle measures failed to differentiate CS+ and CS- either before or after reversal (all p > .01). Event-related potentials, alpha suppression, heart rate and pulse wave responses likewise showed no CS specificity. Only multivariate classifiers: trained (i) on the time-domain EEG signal and (ii) on alpha-band activity, separately, distinguished CS+ from CS- at above-chance levels in late post-stimulus intervals. These neural signatures did not translate into overt physiological or behavioural differences. The pattern suggests that, at least with neutral odors and an auditory US, olfactory fear learning is subtle, spatially variable across the cortex, and easily masked in group-level averages. Our findings highlight both the promise of multivariate EEG for detecting fragile olfactory associations and the challenge of eliciting robust conditioned responses with cross-modal (odor-sound) pairings.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "An acute bout of aerobic exercise (AAE) performed before practicing a motor task can enhance skill acquisition and motor learning. To date, research on the effects of AAE on motor learning has focused exclusively on concentric cycling, leaving the impact of eccentric cycling unexplored. Unlike concentric cycling, eccentric cycling involves muscle lengthening while resisting the reverse movement of the pedals and is characterized by greater force production with lower cardiovascular and metabolic cost. Regarding neuroplasticity changes, eccentric contractions induced a prolonged decrease in intracortical inhibition compared to concentric contractions. Eccentric cycling AAE also increases activation in cognitive-related regions. Given the involvement of these regions and motor cortex excitability in motor learning, we hypothesized that eccentric cycling AAE would enhance motor learning to a greater extent than concentric AAE. A total of 60 young healthy individuals were allocated to one of three groups that performed 20 min of: i) eccentric cycling; ii) concentric cycling; or iii) seated rest. Both cycling AAE conditions were performed at a power equivalent to 70% peak heart rate (i.e., moderate intensity). A continuous tracking task was used to assess motor skill acquisition (immediately after the intervention) and motor learning (48 h retention test). For both acquisition and retention, the eccentric group outperformed both the concentric and rest groups, while the concentric group also showed a better performance compared to the rest group at retention. Thus, we demonstrated that eccentric cycling AAE enhances motor learning to a greater extent than concentric cycling AAE, while also confirming previous work that showed enhanced motor learning following concentric cycling AAE compared to rest.

In many species, sleep behavior is controlled by poorly understood interactions between a system of circadian rhythms (CR), which promote sleep at ecologically appropriate times, and a homeostatic sleep drive that accumulates with time awake. The CR is a cellular phenomenon, driven by molecular oscillations of clock genes in nearly all cells. Emerging evidence indicates neuronal synapses are a key locus for the accumulation and resolution of sleep need, supporting a cellular basis of sleep need. Indeed, efforts to understand the genetic basis of sleep need identified Homer1a, a regulator of synapse homeostasis. To develop further insight into the genetic basis of sleep regulation, we measured daily sleep patterns in genetically diverse strains of mice from the Collaborative Cross. Strains with 1) highly consolidated light-phase sleep, or 2) fragmented, arrhythmic sleep, were identified for genetic analysis using quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Excitingly, in F2 hybrids, 19 of 32 metrics of sleep and circadian behavior mapped to a narrow QTL containing GRM5, a postsynaptic glutamate receptor and binding partner of Homer1a, and GCPII, an astrocytic enzyme that regulates NAAG, a peptide agonist for the presynaptic/astrocytic glutamate receptor GRM3. Collectively, these genes form a coordinated glutamatergic signaling network across the tri-partite synapse. Pharmacology targeting GRM5, GCPII, and GRM3 strongly modulated sleep, functionally validating them as sleep-regulating genes.

Neutrophils infiltrate the spinal cord within the first day after injury, releasing extracellular traps (NETs) comprised of decondensed DNA, modified histones, and granule enzymes, that can worsen tissue damage. Peptidylarginine demininases (PADs), particularly PAD4, have been indicated as mediators of NET formation by facilitating the decondensation of nuclear chromatin via histone citrullination. Though PADs have been shown to be regulated by sex hormones, sex-differences in PAD regulation of neutrophil function in the context of CNS injury have yet to be explored. In this work, we investigated the role of PADs in recovery after SCI using Cl-amidine, a pan-PAD inhibitor. Strikingly, Cl-amidine treated mice exhibited sex-dependent changes to motor function, body weight, and white matter sparing after SCI. Acutely, Cl-amidine treated mice had reduced NET accumulation in the blood and decreased spinal cord neutrophil granularity. Analysis of publicly available scRNA-seq data revealed that female bone marrow neutrophils exhibited elevated Padi4 expression relative to their male counterparts. We then utilized Padi4 knockout (Padi4-/-) mice to assess the role of PAD4 in long-term recovery of male and female mice after SCI.

To address this gap in knowledge, we compared behavioral, histopathological, and transcriptional outcomes in young (2-4 months-old) and middle-aged (10-12 months-old) mice. In contrast to previous studies, open field tests showed no differences in locomotor recovery between the young and middle-aged mice over a one-month period.

However, single cell RNA-sequencing of the cells at the injury site and surrounding spared tissue showed differences in select cell subpopulations.

Common missense polymorphisms in ERAP1 modulate its activity and are found in specific allotypes in humans. ERAP1 allotypes are linked to predisposition to HLA-associated inflammatory diseases. ERAP1 allotypic variation has been correlated with the development of psoriasis and Bechet's disease, through the generation of specific CD8+ T cell populations targeting disease-specific HLAs. Given the established broad effects of ERAP1 activity on the cellular immunopeptidome, we hypothesized that ERAP1 allotypic variation may lead to broad immunopeptidome shifts that underlie antigenic responses. To test this hypothesis, we generated two A375 melanoma cell lines, each one expressing one of the most common, disease-associated, ERAP1 allotypes, namely allotypes 2 or 10. Comparison of the immunopeptidome of these two cell lines showed only minor differences in peptide sequences presented but extensive changes in abundance that included alterations in length distribution, binding affinity and sequence motifs. Our results suggest that enzymatic differences between ERAP1 allotypes are reflected primarily on the quantitative composition of the cellular immunopeptidome.

SP-D has been shown to target gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide via calcium-dependent binding, preferentially to the inner core heptose (HepI). To further investigate this recognition, we have determined the high-resolution crystal structures of a trimeric recombinant fragment of human SP-D complexed with synthetic di- and trisaccharides, HepI-Kdo, HepIII-HepII-HepI, and HepII-HepI phosphorylated at either HepI or HepII, inner core motifs common to the lipopolysaccharide of many gram-negative bacteria. In contrast to acid-hydrolysed lipopolysaccharide used in several previous studies, these synthetic saccharides allow presentation of both the innermost Kdo in its natural pyranose form and heptose phosphorylation. The structures confirm the flexibility of SP-D to adopt an alternative binding mode when the preferred epitope is not available, reveal a preference for recognition of the reducing terminal heptose (HepI) via the glyceryl group, indicate that a single Kdo attached to HepI does not have a significant role in ligand recognition, and provide evidence that recognition of phosphorylated inner core diheptosyl ligands varies dependent on whether HepI or HepII is phosphorylated. The disaccharide with HepII O4' phosphorylation binds via the preferred HepI glyceryl-hydroxyls, while HepI O4' phosphorylation reveals HepII binding via the pyranose ring O3' and O4' hydroxyls. The ability of the HepII O4' phosphate to prevent preferred HepI recognition suggests a role for heptose phosphorylation in shielding the bacterial LPS inner core from immune recognition.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Thus, at present, these organisms are not amenable to in vitro cultivation, which is a prerequisite for effective genetic modification and functional molecular studies. Saprotrophic fungi of the family Arachnopezizaceae are the closest known extant relatives of the powdery mildew fungi and may hold great potential for studying genetic components of their obligate biotrophic lifestyle. Here, we established telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies for two representatives of this family, Arachnopeziza aurata and A. aurelia. Both species harbor haploid genomes that are composed of 16 chromosomes at a genome size of 43.1 and 46.3 million base-pairs, respectively, which, in contrast to most powdery mildew genomes that are transposon-enriched, show a repeat content below 5% and signs of repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Both species could be grown in liquid culture and on solid standard media and were sensitive to common fungicides such as hygromycin and fenhexamid. We successfully expressed a red fluorescent protein and hygromycin resistance in A. aurata following polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation, demonstrating that Arachnopeziza species are amenable to genetic alterations that may include gene replacement, gene modification, and gene complementation. With this work, we established a potential model system that promises to sidestep the need for genetic modification of powdery mildew fungi by using Arachnopeziza species as a proxy to uncover the molecular functions of powdery mildew proteins.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

A promising solution lies in multimodal recordings that combine traditional microphones with animal-borne sensors, such as accelerometers and directional microphones. These sensors, however, are constrained by strict limits on weight, size, and power consumption and often lead to noisy or unstable signals. In this work, we introduce a neural network-based system for sound source separation which leverages multi-channel microphone recordings and body-mounted accelerometer signals. Using a multimodal dataset of zebra finches recorded in a social setting, we demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional microphone array-based systems.

Current guidelines suggest the use of optical phantoms as tools to quantify optical system performance, yet measurements of uniformity and spatial accuracy or distortion remain challenging and are performed in an ad hoc manner or not collected at all. Aim: This work introduces a photostable solid phantom, the Reference Uniformity and Distortion (RUD) phantom, and accompanying analysis code for characterizing fluorescence uniformity and geometric distortion. Additionally, the concept of fluorescence flat-field correction is explored using this phantom. Approach: The RUD phantom was imaged on a custom fluorescence imaging device, as well as five commercial systems. The analysis code characterized uniformity and distortion in these systems. Flat-field correction was explored on the custom device by imaging solid fluorescent reference phantoms at different locations within the field of view. Results: Successful characterization of the imaging systems' uniformity and geometric distortion was achieved. Flat-fielding experiments showed that while it qualitatively improves the appearance of images, it could negatively impact quantitative analyses. Conclusions: The RUD addresses the need for standardized characterization of fluorescence uniformity and geometric distortion. While fluorescence flat-field correction qualitatively enhances image uniformity, caution is advised as it may adversely affect quantitative accuracy.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

In contrast, naturally evolved orthologous genes between species often differ by more than just synonymous substitutions - they can include non-synonymous mutations, insertions, and deletions that confer functional adaptation to different host contexts. Here we present OrthologTransformer, a Transformer-based deep learning model that converts orthologous genes between species by learning from large-scale orthologous gene datasets curated for high-quality sequence alignments. The model recapitulates the full spectrum of evolutionary differences - from synonymous codon swaps to amino acid-changing mutations and indels - to predict a coding sequence optimized for a target species while preserving the protein's function. In extensive validation across diverse bacterial species pairs, OrthologTransformer significantly increased the conversion accuracy of generated genes to native target sequences compared to the original source genes, even for pairs with stark disparities in GC content and optimal growth temperature. The Transformer's context-aware designs also favored conservative amino acid substitutions, maintaining protein functional integrity. As a proof-of-concept, an OrthologTransformer-designed PETase gene for Bacillus subtilis from the host species Ideonella sakaiensis was synthesized and expressed, yielding robust PET plastic-degradation activity that surpassed synonymous codon-optimized controls. These results establish OrthologTransformer as a powerful tool for de novo cross-species gene adaptation, transcending the limits of traditional codon optimization and enabling more effective heterologous gene performance in synthetic biology applications.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

In addition, past studies have focused on the activities of transcription factors in tumors as a whole and thus, have not fully captured the heterogeneity in gene regulation among different cell types within the tumor microenvironment. In this work, through an analysis of the transitions in regulatory network architecture and gene regulation dynamics, we identify the central transcription factors associated with lung adenocarcinoma progression. The gene NR2F1, associated with neurodevelopment and cancer dormancy, emerge as a key transcription factor in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. We further identify transcription factors that are only active in cancer samples and uncover how changes in gene regulation dynamics influence intratumor heterogeneity.

Although prior research has examined the psychological and neural correlates of these emotions, the cognitive antecedents trigger them, as well as their transformation into social behavior, remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we developed a novel task to investigate how two crucial cognitive antecedents, harm and responsibility, elicit guilt and shame, and how these emotions subsequently drive compensatory behavior, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling. Behaviorally, we found that harm had a stronger impact on guilt than on shame, whereas responsibility had a stronger impact on shame than guilt, which support the functionalist theory of emotion. Moreover, compared to shame, guilt exerted a greater effect on compensation. Computational modeling results indicated that individuals integrate harm and responsibility in the form of a quotient, aligning with the phenomenon of responsibility diffusion. The fMRI results revealed that brain regions associated with inequity represenation (posterior insula) and value computation (striatum) encode this integrated measure. Furthermore, individual differences in responsibility-driven shame sensitivity were associated with activity in theory-of-mind regions (temporoparietal junction and superior temporal sulcus). Guilt- and shame-driven compensatory behavior recruited distinct neural substrates, with shame-driven compensatory sensitivity being more strongly linked to activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in cognitive control. Our findings provide computational, algorithmic, and neural accounts of guilt and shame.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

This coordination between nutrient sensing and growth signaling is fundamental to understanding how nutrient supply regulates the cellular metabolic economy. Much of our current understanding is driven by studies that examine the cellular response to nutrient deprivation. For example, TORC1 activity promotes cell growth when amino acids are available, but amino acid deprivation decreases TORC1 activity resulting in activation of catabolic activities. In this study, we examine how cells respond to stimulation with excess amino acids. We report that stimulation with excess Ile, Phe and Met slows cell growth and triggers a G1 cell cycle arrest. Similar to a starvation response, surplus Ile, Phe and Met induce autophagy and trigger decreased TORC1 activity. In the case of stimulation with excess Met, the Gcn2 pathway is required for growth arrest, autophagy induction, and TORC1 dampening. Unexpectedly, Gcn2 is activated by stimulation with excess Met, and this activation requires endocytosis of the methionine transporter Mup1. These results indicate that endocytosis of an amino acid transporter is required to activate the Gcn2 pathway, providing an example for how nutrient transporter trafficking may function as a sensor contributing to cell growth control.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Recently, we found that secretion of cytokine receptor agonist of nuclear factor {kappa}B signaling ligand (RANKL) is higher in lung fibroblasts from patients with COPD compared to control and that RANKL represses lung epithelial cell death. However, the underlying mechanism, its cross-species conservation and the involved epithelial cell types remain unclear. Methods: To investigate how RANKL affects lung epithelial cells we employed in vitro and in vivo models. Primary lung organoids from human and mouse epithelial cells assessed progenitor activation and expansion. Furthermore, we employed a murine model of lung damage to examine which epithelial cell types were affected by RANKL in vivo and whether this was altered upon lung damage. Results: RANKL supplementation increased organoid forming capacity in both murine and human epithelial cells compared to vehicle treated controls. Finally, in elastase-treated mice, RANKL was able to rescue the elastase-induced loss of epithelial cells compared to vehicle-treated controls and it augmented the proportion of epithelial cells in transitional states expressing Krt8 and MHCII. Conclusion: RANKL signaling in lung epithelial cells resulted in enhanced cell survival, primarily observed in alveolar epithelial cells in both mice and humans. In vivo, RANKL was able to expand transitional cell states after elastase-induced lung injury. These results suggest that RANKL is a novel factor in epithelial repair and that its signaling pathway could be explored for therapeutic applications.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Fibronectin is required for the accumulation of collagen type I, the main fibrotic collagen in liver disease. It is presumed that cellular fibronectins including EDA-containing, EDB-containing and oncofetal fibronectin are the ones localized to the fibrotic bundles, since these isoforms are increased in the presence of fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with liver disease. The aim of this work was therefore to evaluate the distribution of the various isoforms and determine whether they are detected in the hepatocytes too or whether they are indeed limited in their expression to fibrotic bundles. Total fibronectin was detected in hepatocytes particularly in healthy liver tissue. In advanced disease, fibronectin staining seemed diminished. All three isoforms, EDA-, EDB-, and oFN were detected in hepatocytes or the fibrotic bundles, with EDB being the most abundant. Interestingly, the isoforms did not fully account for all of fibronectin. Staining patterns confirmed that the three isoforms are not limited to the fibrotic bundles, but are also found in the hepatocytes. This contradicts the common notion that cellular fibronectins precipitate and are localized in the matrix, and explains why they can be measured in the circulation. Finally, there is some convergence between the presence of the isoforms in the fibrotic bundles and the elevation of their levels in the blood stream at least in chronic hepatitis C and cholestatic liver disease. This is in line with a high degree of complexity of fibronectin distribution and effects.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Drawing inspiration from human trichromatic vision, we engineered optimized split fluorescent protein variants (split CFP2, split mNG3A, and split sfCherry3C) and developed a comprehensive library of the 11th {beta}-strand (FP11) tags comprising variable numbers of tandem repeats. Structure-guided protein engineering enhanced the performance of split mNG3A and split sfCherry3C through targeted modifications of their C-terminal sequences and binding interfaces, respectively. By systematically varying the composition and arrangement of FP11 repeats, we selected 20 distinct FP11 tags that enable robust cell population discrimination with 97% accuracy using conventional fluorescence microscopy. In these FP11 tag-expressing cells, we expressed multiple EGF ligands and their receptors and cultured them in bulk to examine the effects of EGF signaling on chemotaxis within the cell population.

We found that VA-induced chromatin decondensation diminished the effects of soft substrates on nuclear morphological parameters, a change not observed on stiff substrates. Furthermore, we showed that the reduction in nuclear stiffness with VA treatment on both substrates was independent of lamin expression, highlighting chromatin decondensation as a key determinant of the observed change in nuclear stiffness.

Despite the Warburg effect, mitochondria are crucial for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1), a key transcription factor in the cellular heat shock response, promotes malignancy and metastasis when aberrantly activated. To understand the multifaceted roles of HSF1 in cancer, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify epistatic interactors of HSF1 in cancer cell proliferation. The verified interactors of HSF1 include those involved in DNA replication and repair, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene expression, and mitochondrial functions. Specifically, we found that HSF1 promotes cell proliferation, mitochondrial biogenesis, respiration, and ATP production in a manner dependent on TIMM17A, a subunit of the inner membrane translocase. HSF1 upregulates the steady-state level of the short-lived TIMM17A protein via its direct target genes, HSPD1 and HSPE1, which encode subunits of the mitochondrial chaperonin complex and are responsible for protein refolding once imported into the matrix. The HSF1-HSPD1/HSPE1-TIMM17A axis remodels the mitochondrial proteome to promote mitochondrial translation and energy production, thereby supporting robust cell proliferation. Our work reveals a mechanism by which mitochondria adjust protein uptake according to the folding capacity in the matrix by altering TIM complex composition.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Endothelial cells (ECs) are known to be highly glycolytic and primarily rely on glucose to meet their energy demands. However, the role of glycogen metabolism in ECs remains poorly characterized due to a lack of suitable tools. Here, we utilize stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy to investigate glycogen metabolism in live ECs exposed to a diabetes-mimicking milieu- high glucose and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-). We show that ECs divert excess glucose toward subcellular glycogen storage, and that this storage capacity is significantly enhanced by the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Pulse-chase experiments uncover glycogen dynamics and reveal rapid mobilization under glucose starvation, highlighting its role as an immediate energy reserve. We further extend the capabilities of SRS imaging to visualize glutamine and lactate metabolism for the first time, directly showcasing EC reliance on alternative substrates during glucose deprivation. ECs containing glycogen exhibit reduced immediate metabolic demand for these gluconeogenic substrates. These findings suggest that glycogen may play a regulatory role in modulating stress-responsive metabolic adaptations and may offer therapeutic opportunities to address diabetes-induced ED and related cardiometabolic diseases.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Epithelial cells primarily segregate transmembrane proteins to apical or basal surfaces, establishing apical-basal polarity. For 3D tissues, apical proteins face inwards and basal proteins are on the outer surfaces (in contact with ECM). Apical-basal polarity can become inverted such that the apical proteins are on the outer surfaces. Originally this polarity inversion was assumed to always occur due to changes in protein trafficking. However, recent work by our group showed that increased RhoA activation causes epithelial spheroids to invert apical-basal polarity via a collective rearrangement of cells, a process we and others have termed eversion. We hypothesized that specific integrin-ECM interactions could facilitate the collective cellular migration required for eversion. Using multiple integrin knockout lines, we observed that epithelial cells lacking either 6 or {beta}4 integrins do not develop apical-out polarity in response to RhoA activation. Similarly, 6 blocking antibody or culturing spheroids in collagen (lacking laminin) also inhibited the formation apical-out polarity. These data indicate that 6{beta}4-laminin interactions are required for eversion. Next, we examined the role of cell proliferation and anchorage independence in maintaining apical-out polarity of everted spheroids. Inhibition of cell proliferation (with DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin) or inhibition of anchorage-independence (with FAK inhibitor 14) were sufficient to restore apical-in polarity to RhoA treated spheroids, indicating that both proliferation and anchorage-independence maintain spheroids in an apical-out state. We also observed that apical-out spheroids can revert to apical-in polarity through apoptotic cavitation of cells located in the center of the spheroids. Lastly, through RNA sequencing we demonstrate that apical-out spheroids have unique gene expression profiles. This study provides new mechanistic insights into the biochemical and biophysical mechanisms that drive eversion and maintain apical-out polarity. This work supports the concept that changing from apical-in to apical-out polarity be an important marker for phenotypic switch in epithelial cells.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

R.; Couceiro, J.; Bras-Pereira, C.; Moreno, E.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the accumulation of Amyloid-beta 42 (A{beta}42) plaques and cognitive decline. Using Drosophila models, we investigated the impact of diet on cell competition, a process that eliminates unfit cells and is involved in AD progression. Cell competition is present in AD flies, where unfit neurons express fweLoseB and azot, leading to their elimination and motor improvements. In this study, we fed AD and control (healthy) flies with either a yeast-based diet (YBD) or a synthetic diet (SAA) for up to 28 days and evaluated cell competition at the cellular level and locomotion as behavioural output. AD flies fed with YBD exhibited a peak of cell competition at day 14 of feeding, being cyclical over time and followed by a progressive locomotion decline. In contrast, the SAA diet delayed the activation of cell competition until day 21, coinciding with locomotion restoration. Moreover, the synthetic diet postponed A{beta} formation, suggesting a slower progression of AD. Overexpression of the human Flower (hFWE) isoforms in Drosophila photoreceptors revealed their conserved function in regulating cell competition, with hFWE1 identified as the sole loser isoform in neuronal context. Conversely, hFWE2, a winner isoform, induced higher levels of cell competition in a diet-dependent manner. hFWE3 and hFWE4 induced a milder effect on cell competition but also have a winner-like function. In YBD-fed AD flies, hFWE2 failed to promote efficient elimination of unfit cells over time, as these flies exhibited even worse locomotion decline than control flies without hFWE2. In contrast with SAA, expression of hFWE2 induced better locomotion outcomes. Our data seems to indicate that diet may regulate AD progression through cell competition regulation, highlighting the complex interplay between diet, cell competition, and AD progression and providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM) was used to investigate relationships between perisynaptic astroglia and dendritic spine synapses undergoing plasticity in the hippocampus of awake adult male rats. Delta-burst stimulation (DBS) of the medial perforant pathway induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the middle molecular layer and concurrent long-term depression (cLTD) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The contralateral hippocampus received baseline stimulation as a within-animal control. Brains were obtained 30 minutes or 2 hours after DBS onset. An automated 3DEM pipeline was developed to enable unbiased quantification of astroglial coverage at the perimeter of the axon-spine interface. Under all conditions, >85% of synapses had perisynaptic astroglia processes within 120 nm of some portion of the perimeter. LTP broadened the distribution of spine sizes while reducing the presence and proximity of perisynaptic astroglia near the axon-spine interface of large spines. In contrast, cLTD transiently reduced the length of the axon-spine interface perimeter without substantially altering astroglial apposition. The postsynaptic density was discovered to be displaced from the center of the axon-spine interface, with this offset increasing during LTP and decreasing during cLTD. Astroglial access to the postsynaptic density was diminished during LTP and enhanced during cLTD, in parallel with changes in spine size. Thus, access of perisynaptic astroglia to synapses is dynamically modulated during LTP and cLTD alongside synaptic remodeling.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

O.; Reichmann, F.", "abstract": "Background: Social behaviour encompasses the wide range of interactions that occur between members of the same species. In humans, disruptions in social behaviour are characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, where both genetic risk factors and synaptic dysfunctions can contribute to the phenotype. Among the genes implicated in synaptic regulation, the synaptic adhesion protein leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein 4 (LRRTM4) has been identified as a key player in maintaining synaptic function and neuronal circuit integrity. Despite its established role in the nervous system, the potential involvement of LRRTM4 in modulating social behaviour and its contribution to social deficits has yet to be explored. Methods: In the current study, we used zebrafish to study how genetic deletion of lrrtm4l1, a zebrafish orthologue of LRRTM4, affects sociality. For this, the social behaviour of homozygous lrrtm4l1 knockout (KO) zebrafish was analysed in multiple behavioural assays and the brain transcriptome of mutant animals was investigated by RNAseq. Results: KO zebrafish displayed a pro-social phenotype in multiple behavioural assays. Groups of lrrtm4l1 KO zebrafish formed more cohesive shoals and KO individuals spent more time in the vicinity of conspecifics during a social interaction test. They were also less aggressive and in contrast to wild-type zebrafish did not differentiate in their interactions with known and unknown groups of fish. Neurotranscriptomic analysis revealed 560 differentially expressed genes including changes in glutamatergic neurotransmitter signalling, tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism and synaptic plasticity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that lrrtm4l1 is an important regulator of social behaviour in zebrafish. In a translational perspective, LRRTM4 is a promising potential therapeutic target that warrants further investigation in the framework of neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by major social impairments.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

This study investigates the dynamics of alpha rhythm across the lifespan, focusing on how E-I balance modulates alpha power and peak frequency, and exploring the distinct age-related and sex-specific patterns of alpha activity. Using a computational E-I model, we simulated the impact of different neuronal connections and E-I ratios on alpha rhythm characteristics. The results suggest that self-regulation primarily affects alpha power, while interaction between excitatory and inhibitory neurons influences both alpha frequency and power. We applied this model to real EEG data from 3265 participants across a wide age range, revealing that alpha power and peak frequency exhibit an inverted U-shape across the lifespan, peaking in early adulthood and declining in old age. Significant sex differences in alpha activity were observed primarily during puberty and later in life. Decomposition of the alpha band into periodic and aperiodic components showed that periodic activity follows the inverted U-shape, while aperiodic activity declines exponentially with age. Our findings indicate that alpha rhythm is governed by complex E-I dynamics, with distinct contributions from periodic and non-periodic components, and highlight the role of alpha rhythm in age-related cognitive changes and sex differences in brain function.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

To better understand the transcriptional regulation of A{beta} production, we employed long-read RNA sequencing and identified previously unannotated transcripts encoding APP-C99 with an additional methionine residue (APP-C100), generated independently of {beta}-secretase cleavage. These transcripts are expressed separately from full-length APP, and we observed that cells lacking full-length APP can still produce A{beta} through these shorter isoforms.

Autophagy is deregulated in various pathological conditions including cardiovascular, neurological, neoplastic- autoimmune and degenerative disorders.

Here, we describe a simple method to detect autophagy in cultured mammalian cells based on the pH-sensitive fluorescent conjugate CalRexin:pHrodo Red and high throughput/content imaging. CalRexin:pHrodo Red is promptly taken up by endosome- amphisome-autolysosome (low pH ~4.5) pathway, which is connected to canonical autophagy, culminating with a bright red fluorescence. Importantly, this system allows for the discrimination between autophagic responses coupled with the endosome-amphisome-autolysosome pathways and the endosome-lysosome pathway as elicited by receptor-driven endocytosis and phagocytosis. In human cervical carcinoma sHeLa cells, the accumulation of CalRexin:pHrodo Red as elicited by canonical autophagy activators like the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or serum starvation was suppressed by conventional inhibitors 3-methyladenine or chloroquine. Similarly, RB1CC1-/- (FIP200) as well as ATG5-/- sHeLa cells (which bear genetic defects in two different steps of autophagy) were unable to accumulate CalRexin:pHrodo Red upon exposure to autophagy activators.

Our force measurements revealed that individual formin Cdc12 molecules transmit up to ~6 pN with distinct mechanisms between the regions upstream and downstream of the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain, which binds the barbed ends of actin filaments. The force transmitted on the N-terminal region before the FH2 domain requires anchoring to a cytokinetic node via the Cdc15 binding region, but is independent of the C-terminal region after FH2.

Specifically, we demonstrate that the teleost-specific extracellular matrix gene elastin b confers the uniquely low stiffness of the BA. In contrast to the BA, the homologous organ in non-teleost actinopterygians, the conus arteriosus (CA), and the ventricle are predominantly composed of cardiomyocytes, and exhibit higher extracellular stiffness. Loss of elastin b function by knockdown or knockout leads to ectopic cardiomyocyte formation in the BA, accompanied by increased extracellular stiffness comparable to that of the ventricle. Furthermore, artificial stiffening of the BA extracellular environment is sufficient to induce ectopic cardiomyocyte differentiation.

In contrast, cell growth averaging is reduced in the ftsh4-5 mutant, and the sepals develop to variable sizes and shapes. FTSH4 encodes a mitochondrial i-AAA protease localized to the mitochondria. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate in ftsh4-5 mutants, and lowering ROS levels rescues the sepal size and shape variability. Here, we investigate the effects of ROS on cell growth heterogeneity and cortical microtubule dynamics. We find that elevated ROS suppresses cell growth heterogeneity and averaging. We also find that elevated ROS causes cortical microtubules to become more crisscrossed, as well as more stable. The growth of the cells with crisscrossed microtubules changes less in time, which impairs cell growth averaging. However, depolymerizing microtubules is insufficient to restore normal growth fluctuations.

Here we investigated functions of the three zebrafish dchs genes, dchs1a, dchs1b and dchs2 that encode large atypical cadherins and report that they have partially overlapping functions in epiboly progression. We have inserted GFP at the C-terminal Dchs1b intracellular domain of the endogenous dchs1b locus using homologous recombination. We observed the resulting Dchs1b-GFP fusion protein localized in both the cell membrane and the cytoplasm of EVL and embryonic cells during gastrulation. The dynamic microtubule and actin cytoskeleton of the yolk cell are essential for epiboly. Our studies of the yolk microtubule network demonstrate that these microtubules are more bundled and show faster polymerization during epiboly in dchs triple loss-of-function mutant embryos than in wild-type embryos, indicating that dchs genes are required for limiting microtubule polymerization and promoting dynamics during epiboly. The epiboly progression defects of dchs1b deficient mutants were suppressed by mutations in the tetratricopeptide repeat protein 28 (ttc28) gene encoding a cytoplasmic protein previously shown to bind to Dchs1b intracellular domain and alter microtubule dynamics during early cleavages. We further demonstrate that MZdchs1b mutants exhibit abnormal organization and dynamics of yolk cell actin cytoskeleton during epiboly. Together, these lines of evidence as well as our transcriptomic analyses support the notion that like during early embryonic cleavages, Dchs1b plays a major role, while Dchs1a and Dchs2 proteins have supporting roles in regulating microtubule dynamics and organization of both microtubule and actin cytoskeleton to ensure normal epiboly.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used in vitro reconstitution assays and kinetic modeling to dissect filament nucleation mediated by the S. cerevisiae formin Bni1p. We found that formins assemble filament nuclei by sequentially binding three actin monomers in a process that takes place in parallel to spontaneous actin assembly. Whereas the formin FH2 domain preferentially binds actin monomers, the flexible FH1 domain facilitates de novo filament formation by binding and transferring profilin-actin complexes to a free FH2 dimer. FH1-mediated delivery stimulates filament nucleation in a distance- and sequence-dependent manner. The architectures of FH1 domains therefore maximize the efficiency of formin-mediated polymerization through optimized engagement of each of their profilin-binding sites.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

E.; Sprekeler, H.; Nichele, S.; O'Leary, T.", "abstract": "In many parts of the brain, population tuning to stimuli and behaviour gradually changes over the course of days to weeks in a phenomenon known as representational drift. The tuning stability of individual cells varies over the population, and it remains unclear what drives this heterogeneity. We investigate how a neurons tuning stability relates to its shared variability with other neurons in the population using two published datasets from posterior parietal cortex and visual cortex. We quantified the contribution of pairwise interactions to behaviour or stimulus encoding by partial information decomposition, which breaks down the mutual information between the pairwise neural activity and the external variable into components uniquely provided by each neuron and by their interactions. Information shared by the two neurons is termed redundant and information requiring knowledge of the state of both neurons is termed synergistic. We found that a neurons tuning stability is positively correlated with the strength of its average pairwise redundancy with the population, and that these high-redundancy neurons also tend to show high average pairwise synergy. We hypothesize that subpopulations of neurons show greater stability because they are tuned to salient features common across multiple tasks. Regardless of the mechanistic implications of our work, the stability-redundancy relationship may support improved longitudinal neural decoding in technology that has to track population dynamics over time, such as brain-machine interfaces.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

The connectome of cortical networks is high-dimensional, whereas neuronal activity is often low-dimensional relative to the number of neurons. Consequently, only a small fraction of the information contained in the connectome is relevant to activity. Can this relevant information be identified? In this study, we propose that the activity of each excitatory neuron in the sensory cortex can be approximated as a point in an embedding space defined by its connectome. Using the MICrONS dataset, which provides millimeter-scale, nanometer-resolution data on proofread and coregistered neurons, we perform a correlation analysis and identify a statistically significant alignment between morphological and functional similarities. Topological analysis reveals that the structured representation spaces of both neuronal activity and connectome share a low-dimensional, hyperbolic geometry with exponential scalability. Based on these findings, we develop a simple linear model to reconstruct in vivo neuronal activity by embedding anatomical affinities using multidimensional scaling (MDS). This approach achieves an explanation ratio of $68\\%$ compared to directly using activity similarity, outperforming the $56\\%$ obtained using the full connectome. Our results highlight a clear and robust structure-function coupling: although geometry-compatible dimensionality reduction methods discard much of the connectome's detailed information, they prove more effective in predicting neuronal activity, suggesting that synaptic connections may encode an abstract low-dimensional organization.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

While the BL signaling pathway is well understood in C3 and C4 plants, its role in crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants remains uncertain. Traditionally, stomata in CAM plants were considered insensitive to BL stimulation, and as a result, studies on such interaction were overlooked for a long time. Only recently, studies have found that the BL signaling cascade is active in CAM plants. Here, we investigated the effects of BL intensity on stomatal behavior in Agave, a highly productive CAM plant, by stimulating Agave leaves with BL and taking measurements of leaf gas exchange during the morning (closed stomata) and in the afternoon (open stomata). Our findings revealed that BL had no significant effect on stomatal opening during the morning period. However, BL increased stomatal conductance (gs) by 67.3%, photosynthetic rate (A) by 109.5%, and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) by 69.5% in the late afternoon. These findings suggest that Agave responded to BL similarly to C3 and C4 species when stomata were already open. We hypothesized that high CO2 levels due to C4 acid decarboxylation during the morning act as a repressive factor for stomatal opening by inhibiting the phosphorylative activity of the HT1 protein, a key protein involved in stomatal behavior. This inhibition likely prevents the activation of the signaling pathway mediated by CBC1/2 kinase, which integrates blue light (BL) signals with low intercellular CO2 levels.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Herein, flat-leaf parsley seedlings were grown in an experimental hydroponic vertical farm and inoculated with Pythium irregulare and Phytophthora nicotianae. Subsequently, the seedlings were imaged via 3D, multispectral, and thermal sensors at various stages of growth to obtain twenty-six image-based plant features. Following a preliminary screening of redundant features via regression analysis, data for seventeen image features associated with morphometric, spectral, and thermal attributes was co-analyzed using supervised machine learning by Support Vector Machines (SVM). Exhaustive feature selection using different SVM kernels and maximum feature thresholds was performed to identify optimal feature subsets. It was observed that combining parameters obtained from all three imaging platforms enabled better identification of infected samples (>99%) than using a higher number of attributes from individual imaging systems. In addition, model performance was improved considerably by including temporal information during model training.

We exposed 300 tree seedlings of ten species to six different warming treatments. We assessed budburst, leaf out, vigor, and freezing damage on a weekly basis and measured the cold tolerance of species exposed to warming. The timing of leaf out varied among species, and generally warming treatments advanced leaf out 5 - 41 days. Leaf out was best predicted by photoperiod for deciduous trees and thermal time for evergreen trees. Cold tolerance was reduced for most species (5 - 29 C) when exposed to only two weeks of warming, reducing their safety margin from freezing damage.

In this study, we explore factors influencing fleshiness or dryness of fruits at maturity through examining the water content variation patterns before and after fruit maturity, and identify biological and environmental mechanisms about fleshiness or not for fruits at maturity, using data from a survey on fruit shapes of 29760 species and one experiment involving water content measure of fruits. Results show that water content in majority of the fleshy (except for drupes and rosehips) and dry fruits increases or decreases, respectively, during fruit development i.e. prior to maturity, and the water variation patterns are determined by fruit shapes and pericarp permeability. After maturation, water loss occurs slowly at room temperature for fleshy fruits, but it is fast for most dry fruits. In general, declining fruit water content due to pericarp lignification occurring and rising pericarp permeability with the development of dry fruits in later stage of fruit development as well as water imbalance between supply and loss induced by open habitats may lead to the formation of dryness for elongated or flaky dry fruits owing to allometric growth between pedicel diameter (or fruit mass) and fruit surface area. Resulted from water balance, the emergence of fleshiness in mature fleshy fruits is attributed to slow water loss through the pericarp influenced by globular shapes (i.e. greater fruit thickness) and pericarp waxification induced by shaded habitats, or by sporoderm lignification occurring (inside the pericarp) induced by open habitats for a subset of fleshy fruits such as drupes and rosehips.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

While the axis associated HORMA-domain protein ASY1 is known to be necessary for the localization of the recombinase DMC1 to the axis, the molecular mechanism linking ASY1 to DMC1 loading remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ASY1 directly recruits the plant-specific cyclin SDS to chromosomes, which ensures efficient DMC1 localization and interhomolog recombination. Live-cell imaging and immunodetection revealed that SDS localizes to chromosomes from leptotene to zygotene and dissociates from chromosomes after pachytene resembling DMC1 dynamics. Biochemical assays demonstrated a direct interaction between ASY1 and SDS. Further analyses revealed that ASY1 closure motif, a conformational regulatory element, is required for SDS recruitment despite being dispensable for ASY1 own chromosome association. Moreover, unlike in sds mutants, depletion of the DMC1 inhibitor FIGL1-FLIP complex failed to restore DMC1 foci in asy1 mutants, positioning ASY1 upstream of both positive (SDS) and negative (FIGL1-FLIP) regulators of DMC1.

This timing across seasons (i.e. phenology) is often under spatially-varying selection across climate gradients, and species often exhibit genetic clines in phenology. Clines for transitions like germination and flowering time are well documented; less is known about the juvenile-to-adult vegetative phase change (VPC) - a conserved (among plants) yet visually subtle developmental transition marked by changes in leaf morphology and physiology. Alternatively, developmental tradeoffs can reduce fitness differences between genotypes and promote diversity within populations. Here, we tested 158 diverse genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana under drought during either the juvenile or adult vegetative phases along with well-watered controls. We measured performance, physiology, and timing of developmental transitions. We found strong rank-changing genotype-environment interactions with fitness depending on the stage at which drought occurred, indicating tradeoffs and distinct mechanisms of drought adaptation between different stages. Fitness reductions were generally greater under juvenile drought, suggesting that the juvenile phase is more vulnerable than the adult phase to stress. Adult plants significantly increased water use efficiency in response to drought but juvenile plants did not, consistent with earlier results showing reduced plasticity in the juvenile phase. Genome-wide association mapping revealed candidate loci for the timing of VPC and stage-specific drought responses. Globally, VPC timing was weakly related to climate but in Iberia there was a significant trend of early VPC in seasonally dry climates and late VPC in moist climates. Analysis of global geographic variation in putative QTL showed a strong depletion in SNPs associated with the timing of VPC and juvenile drought fitness, suggesting variation in these loci is maintained within populations due to consistent tradeoffs all across Arabidopsis range. These results demonstrate that the timing of VPC contributes to adaptive responses to drought and that tradeoffs across developmental stages help maintain genetic diversity in natural populations.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

S.; Fujii, S.", "abstract": "In vascular plants, genes in the plastid genome are transcribed by two types of RNA polymerases, namely bacterial-type nuclear-encoded and phage-type plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerases (NEP and PEP, respectively). Eudicots, including Arabidopsis, carry two isoforms of NEP, RPOTp and RPOTmp. NEPs transcribe multiple plastid-encoded genes including subunits of PEP and translocon, thus are indispensable for the maintenance of plastids. However, regulatory mechanisms of NEPs are largely unknown. RPOTmp transcribes the 16S rRNA gene from a specific promoter in the seeds during vernalization, and its mutation in Arabidopsis retards the chloroplast development. As interacting partners of RPOTmp, two NEP-INTERACTING PROTEINs (NIP1 and NIP2) have been identified and suggested to suppress RPOTmp activity by tethering RPOTmp to the thylakoid membrane during chloroplast development in the presence of light, but their precise roles in transcriptional regulation remain to be addressed. From these previous reports, we hypothesize that functions of RPOTmp would depend on the light conditions and expression of NIPs. To gain insight into how RPOTmp is controlled, we performed functional analysis of RPOTmp and NIPs using Arabidopsis mutants during germination in the dark and de-etiolation processes under light. We found that RPOTmp-dependent transcription of 16S rRNA is active in imbibed seeds and remains basal level throughout the post-germination processes, regardless of light conditions. We also demonstrated a limited impact of NIPs on RPOTmp function during these processes. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that NIPs have distinct evolutionary profiles compared to RPOTmp, and Arabidopsis is unlikely to have additional NIP-like proteins in plastids. Based on these findings, we propose a modified model of RPOTmp regulation during chloroplast development: RPOTmp activity remains stable throughout the process of the chloroplast differentiation and is unaffected by light and NIPs.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

In this study, we propose that variations in lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, driven by intrinsic differences in iron levels between normal and cancerous tissues, contribute to this effect. Our findings show that FLASH RT increases lipid peroxidation and induces ferroptosis in tumor cells but does not significantly elevate lipid peroxidation in normal tissues compared to conventional RT. To determine whether raising iron levels in normal tissues could abrogate the protective effects of FLASH, mice were fed a high-iron diet before RT. A high-iron diet before and after RT reversed the protective effect of FLASH, resulting in increased intestinal damage and lipid peroxidation. This suggests that baseline iron levels and iron-driven lipid peroxidation are critical factors in mediating the protective outcomes of FLASH RT. Overall, our study sheds light on the role of iron in modulating RT responses and provides new mechanistic insights into how FLASH RT influences normal and cancerous tissues.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Advanced prostate cancer (PrCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related death among men because nearly all patients progress on standard therapy that targets androgen receptor (AR) signaling. An important mechanism driving therapeutic resistance is lineage plasticity, the ability of PrCa cells to reprogram into lineage variants like neuroendocrine (NE) PrCa that no longer depend on AR signaling. The histone methyltransferase EZH2 has been implicated in PrCa lineage plasticity and EZH2 inhibitors are being evaluated clinically for the treatment of PrCa. Here we test how Ezh2 impacts the evolution of PrCa lineage plasticity using genetically engineered mice and human patient data. Reduced Ezh2 expression diversifies the evolution of PrCa lineage variants, including a newly discovered variant with high expression of neurofilament genes, in both mice and humans. Lineage variant diversification is associated with activation of Klf transcription factor programs and AR cistrome reprogramming that is normally repressed by Ezh2. These findings advance the understanding of PrCa lineage plasticity and have implications for using EZH2 as a target for PrCa therapy.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

We therefore took advantage of the diversity of bone marrow stromal cells to shed light on how fibroblasts modulate cancer growth. In two murine cancer models, adding these fibroblasts to tumor cells resulted in smaller lesions. Suppression was enhanced by pretreatment with fibronectin, while genetic deletion of fibronectin in a small subpopulation of stromal cells expressing osterix/sp7 restored growth. The suppressive stromal population showed two more characteristics: the absence of CD31/pecam1 and CD105/endoglin. However, only a decrease in CD105/ENDOGLIN in melanoma patients translated in improved survival. Mechanistically, fibronectin or fibronectin fragments activate integrin 5{beta}1 and TLR4 and increase chemokine production by stromal cells ultimately leading to enhanced recruitment and activity of Ly6G+ myeloid cells without T-cell involvement. This work thus characterizes a beneficial interaction between stromal cells and neutrophils enhancing the immune response against early cancer.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Upregulation of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) can fuel tumor growth, and cancers with this phenotype are often sensitive to SSP inhibitors. In parallel, dietary restriction of serine and glycine (SG) can suppress some cancers, but the determinants of sensitivity to this approach are poorly understood. This is especially true in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where serine metabolism has been less explored. We report that a subset of human AML cell lines and primary samples are completely dependent on external serine, known as serine auxotrophy. These leukemias consistently suppressed the SSP enzyme PSAT1, failed to synthesize serine, responded to SG restriction in vivo, and were rescued by restoring PSAT1. We also found that AML with an SF3B1 K700E mutation showed additional dependence on the SSP enzyme PHGDH, that SG restriction synergized with venetoclax in serine auxotrophic AML, and that MECOM rearrangement was strongly associated with PSAT1 suppression and serine auxotrophy.

We identify that glioblastoma heterogeneity is driven by spatially-patterned transitions of cancer cells from developmental-like states towards those defined by a glial injury response and hypoxia. This cellular trajectory regionalises tumours into distinct tissue niches and manifests in a molecularly conserved manner across tumours as well as genetically distinct tumour subclones. Moreover, using a new deep learning framework to map cancer cell states jointly with clones in situ, we show that tumour subclones are finely spatially intermixed through glioblastoma tissue niches.

E.; Engelward, B. P.", "abstract": "N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is present in food, water, and drugs and is considered a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The mechanism of action of NDMA involves the generation of carcinogenic methyl lesions such as 3-methyladenine (3MeA) on DNA bases. Alkyladenine DNA Glycosylase (AAG) removes 3MeA to initiate Base Excision Repair, leaving an intermediary lesion that is subsequently resolved by backbone cleavage, nucleotide insertion, and backbone ligation. The intermediate steps following lesion removal produce potentially toxic and mutagenic single-strand DNA breaks. Here, we explored differences between males and females regarding downstream DNA damage, toxicity, mutations and cancer arising from 3MeA in the livers of WT, Aag-/-, and Aag-overexpressing (AagTg) mice. We found that males were more susceptible to NDMA-induced mutations (WT and Aag-/-) and cancer (all genotypes). In contrast, AagTg females were more prone than males to micronucleus induction. As we showed in our prior analyses where data were pooled for males and females, Aag-/- mice were significantly more susceptible to NDMA-induced mutations and cancer, and AagTg mice displayed significantly greater toxicity. Building on these findings, our analyses of sex-related differences show that Aag deficiency and maleness are both susceptibility factors for NDMA-induced liver cancer, while Aag overexpression drives toxicity, potentially with a greater effect on females. By assessing differences between males and females, this study reveals a deeper mechanistic understanding of the underpinnings for a well-known increased risk of liver cancer in men versus women by demonstrating a higher susceptibility of male mice to both mutations and cancer.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Extensive molecular characterization based on gene expression and DNA methylation patterns has solidly established three major ATRT subtypes (MYC, SHH and TYR), which show distinct clinical features, setting the basis for more effective, targeted treatment regimens. Transcriptional activity of transposable elements (TEs), like LINE1s and LTRs, is tightly linked with human cancers as a direct consequence of lifting epigenetic repression over TEs. The sole recurrent biallelic loss-of-function mutation in SMARCB1 in ATRTs, a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, raises the question of how TE transcription contributes to ATRT development. Here, we comprehensively investigate the transcriptional profiles of 1.9M LINE1 and LTR elements across ATRT subtypes in primary human samples. We find TE transcription profiles are unique, allowing sample stratification into ATRT subtypes. The TE activity signature in ATRT-MYC subtype is unique, setting these tumors apart from SHH and TYR ATRTs. More specifically, ATRT-MYC shows broadly reduced transcript levels of LINE1 and ERVL-MaLR subfamilies. ATRT-MYC is also unique in having significantly less LTR and LINE1 loci with bidirectional promoter activity. Furthermore, we identify 849 differentially transcribed TEs in primary samples, which are predictive towards established ATRT-SHH and -MYC cell line models. In summary, including TE transcription profiles into the molecular characterization of ATRTs might reveal new tumor vulnerabilities leading to novel therapeutic interventions, such as immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

We performed integrative multi-omics studies in human pulmonary carcinoma cells to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms induced by erlotinib. We identified 746 genes (including 34 tumor suppressor genes, TSG) that were upregulated after treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib (another EGFR-TKI). Interestingly, 45% of the upregulated genes (including 24 TSG) were in broad domains of the euchromatin histone mark H3K4me3, and 63% (including 26 TSG) exhibited reduced levels of the heterochromatin histone mark H3K27me3 after erlotinib treament. Further, H3K27ac-specific chromosome conformation capture-based methods revealed that erlotinib significantly increased number and length of chromatin loops between promoters of upregulated genes and active enhancers. We also detected augmented chromatin accessibility after erlotinib treatment at the promoters of upregulated genes, which correlated with binding of the transcription activator FOXA2. Remarkably, we identified gene clusters that seem to be upregulated by promoters with enhancer activity (Epromoters) enriched with FOXA2. The clinical relevance of our findings was confirmed by data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, showing significantly improved survival outcomes in LC patients with high levels of FOXA2 and/or the 34 TSG found upregulated by erlotinib.

We find that the mechanism of extrusion in SiHa cells is similar to those that drive live cell extrusion in normal epithelia, suggesting the utility of this model. We propose that the subset that is extruded during overcrowding is resistant to anoikis and acquires promigratory features. We find that this population also exhibits an increase in TGF-{beta} signaling, which we show is a promigratory factor in cervical cancer cells and is a potential driver for the migratory potential observed in the extruded population.

For example, connectomics studies offer a powerful emerging approach for understanding neural circuit organization. However, electron microscopy (EM) data is difficult to interpret when the preservation quality is imperfect, which is common in brain banking and may render it unsuitable for certain research applications. One common issue is that EM images of postmortem brain tissue can have an expansion of regions that appear to be made up of extracellular space and/or degraded cellular material, which we call ambiguous interstitial zones. In this study, we report a method to assess whether EM images have ambiguous interstitial zone artifacts in a cohort of 10 postmortem brains with samples from each of the cortex and thalamus. Next, in matched samples from the contralateral hemisphere of the same brains, we evaluate the structural preservation quality of light microscopy images, including immunostaining for cytoskeletal proteins. Through this analysis, we show that on light microscopy, cell membrane morphology can be largely maintained, and neurite trajectory visualized over micrometer distances, even in specimens for which there are ambiguous interstitial zone artifacts on EM.

Confinement acted as a potent phagocytic driver, greatly increasing the fraction of phagocytic cells in the population compared to the unconfined setting. Arp2/3 complex and myosin II contributed to this effect. Remarkably, confinement partially rescued phagocytic uptake upon myosin II disruption. In addition, cells under confinement were partially resistant to the actin-depolymerizing drug cytochalasin D. Unexpectedly, we observed that bead uptake stimulated persistent migration, a process we term phagocytic priming. Integrin-dependent adhesion was required for phagocytic priming in unconfined and confined settings, but was dispensable for phagocytic uptake. The cytoskeletal requirements for phagocytic priming differed depending on confinement state. Myosin II and Arp2/3 complex were required for phagocytic priming under confinement, but not in unconfined settings.

A few studies have used anti-NCAM antibody-bead-based immunocapture to enrich nEVs from plasma, some with little method validation. We therefore examined in detail this method for nEV enrichment. Methods: EVs were isolated from SH-SY5Y cell-conditioned media by precipitation, or from plasma using size exclusion chromatography. EVs were characterised using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunoblot analysis. SH-SY5Y-EVs were incubated with anti-NCAM immunocapture beads and examined by flow cytometry, immunoblot analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Immunocaptured plasma-derived EVs were examined using a sensitive NCAM ELISA, SEM and qPCR for miRNAs. Results: Characterisation of SH-SY5Y-derived and plasma-derived EVs revealed the expected size distributions of EVs using NTA, the presence of EV markers using immunoblot analysis, and a cup-shaped morphology using TEM. Anti-NCAM beads, but not anti-L1CAM or IgG beads, captured NCAM-positive SH-SY5Y-EVs as shown by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis. Both SH-SY5Y and plasma-derived EVs were visualised on the surface of anti-NCAM immunocapture beads using SEM. A sensitive NCAM ELISA detected NCAM antigen in plasma-derived EVs immunocaptured on anti-NCAM beads. qPCR analysis of plasma-derived EVs detected many miRNAs in total plasma-EVs with high expression of hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-451a and hsa-miR-126-3p. However, only between two and seven miRNAs were detected in EVs captured on anti-NCAM-beads from three blood donors. Finally, tissue distribution analysis of miRNAs from plasma-derived EVs on anti-NCAM beads revealed that these miRNAs are enriched in tissues or organs such as blood vessels, lung, bone, thyroid and heart, but were not enriched for brain-derived miRNAs. Discussion: This study indicates that anti-NCAM beads can efficiently enrich NCAM-positive EVs from cell culture conditioned media. However, nEV levels in small volumes of plasma are possibly too low to enable efficient anti-NCAM immunocapture for subsequent miRNA analysis. Other neuron-specific markers with high expression levels on nEVs are therefore required for processing patient samples where plasma volumes are likely to be low, and to allow efficient isolation of nEVs in clinical studies for subsequent cargo analysis.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

C.; Haseeb, M. A.; Bickel, S.

One factor that contributes to increased segregation errors in aging oocytes is premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion. However, the mechanisms underlying age-dependent deterioration of cohesion are not well-defined. Autophagy, a cellular degradation process critical for cellular homeostasis, is known to decline with age in various organisms and cell types. Here we quantify basal autophagy in Drosophila oocytes and use GAL4/UAS inducible knockdown to ask whether disruption of autophagy in prophase oocytes impacts the fidelity of chromosome segregation. We find that individual knockdown of autophagy proteins in Drosophila oocytes during meiotic prophase causes a significant increase in segregation errors. In addition, Atg8a knockdown in prophase oocytes leads to premature loss of arm cohesion and missegregation of recombinant homologs during meiosis I. Using an oocyte aging paradigm that we have previously described, we show that basal autophagy decreases significantly when Drosophila oocytes undergo aging. Our data support the model that a decline in autophagy during oocyte aging contributes to premature loss of meiotic cohesion and segregation errors.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

This technique, involving the engineering of a template with a bacteriophage promoter sequence, enables the synthesis of RNA for use in a variety of applications including structural studies, biochemical assays, and as functional molecules. Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy has tremendous potential in regenerative medicine, disease treatment, and vaccination. Synthetic mRNA leverages the cell's natural translation machinery to produce proteins, with the ability to transfect cells and induce expression of target proteins under physiological conditions until it is eventually degraded. In this study, we explore the impact of pseudouridine ({Psi})-modified mRNA in enhancing RNA stability, translational efficiency, and immune compatibility for therapeutic use. By optimizing IVT conditions and employing cellulose-based purification techniques, we successfully synthesized high-quality, modified mRNA that demonstrated superior functional performance. Luciferase and GFP mRNA, synthesized with pseudouridine-modified rNTPs, exhibited improved stability, reduced immune activation, and enhanced translation efficiency in HEK293 cells. A sevenfold increase in luciferase activity and elevated GFP fluorescence confirmed the higher protein expression capabilities of the modified mRNA. Furthermore, cellulose bead purification effectively separated single-stranded RNA from double-stranded RNA contaminants, ensuring minimal immune response and maximizing transfection efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of pseudouridine-modified mRNA and refined purification methods for advancing mRNA-based therapies, from vaccines to protein-replacement treatments, setting the foundation for scalable, clinical-grade RNA production.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

M.; Velle, K. B.; Fritz-Laylin, L.", "abstract": "Cell morphogenesis is crucial for the physiology of animals and fungi alike. While animals typically shape their cells using the actin cytoskeleton, fungi control cell shape through polarized deposition of new cell wall material, which is inflated by intracellular osmotic turgor pressure. Understanding where and when these mechanisms evolved is essential for understanding the evolution of cell morphogenesis. To this end, we study chytrid fungi, which have a cell type that lacks a cell wall (the zoospore) and a cell type that has a cell wall (the sporangium). While chytrid sporangia rely on polarized cell wall growth to control shape, we previously showed that the frog-killing chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) uses actin to control zoospore shape. Whether either zoospores or sporangia also use intracellular pressure regulation in cell shape control remains an open question. Here, we use live-cell imaging, environmental perturbations, and small molecule inhibitors to show that Bd sporangia generate and maintain turgor pressure, while Bd zoospores use specialized organelles called contractile vacuoles to pump water out of the cell, thereby keeping internal pressure low. Because chytrid fungi diverged prior to the evolution of the Dikarya--the fungal group comprising yeast, mushrooms, and filamentous fungi--these findings suggest that turgor pressure evolved early, and that cell morphogenesis underwent a major transition during early fungal evolution. We also suggest that the last common fungal ancestor may have, like chytrid fungi, employed stage-specific strategies for cell shape control--illustrating how developmental flexibility in cellular mechanisms can serve as a wellspring of evolutionary innovation.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we pair time-lapse imaging of cell-cycle dynamics with single-cell RNA-sequencing after etoposide treatment to differentiate these states, linking heterogeneous cell-cycle phenotypes to the transcriptomic landscape. We identify diverse senescent types (senotypes) and link them to two arrest pathways - a gradual path arising after a standard mitosis-to-G0 transition, and a rarer but direct path driven by a mitotic slip. Using pseudotime trajectory analysis, we find that senescent phenotypes begin to manifest early and gradually along the first trajectory, even in shallow quiescent cells.

Epitope tagging is widely used in studying septin localizations and functions. However, their functionalities are rarely tested rigorously because of technical challenges. Fission yeast provides an ideal genetic system to test functionalities of tagged septins. Septins Spn1 and Spn4 localize exclusively to the division site as double rings during cytokinesis with mEGFP or mYFP tags. However, both septins also localized to puncta or linear structures across the plasma membrane during interphase when tagged with tdTomato. It was proposed that these interphase septin structures are important for the localizations and functions of several proteins including the NDR-kinase Sid2 and active Cdc42. By analyzing cell morphology, cytokinesis/septation defects, and genetic interactions between tagged septins and the arrestin art1{triangleup} and anillin mid2{triangleup}, we find that septins tagged with tdTomato or 3HA are not functional. Moreover, Sid2 appearance at the division site is later than septins and delayed in septin mutants, contrary to previous report.

CK1a, anchored to FRQ, hyperphosphorylates FRQ at its IDRs in a slow, temperature-independent manner, forming a module suited for molecular timekeeping. However, the molecular processes triggered by FRQ's hyperphosphorylation have remained unclear. We show that FRH, the folded binding partner of disordered FRQ, decodes FRQ's time-dependent phosphorylation state by triggering a two-step remodeling of the FRQ-FRH complex: initially, two FRH molecules bind a FRQ dimer, keeping it inactive by blocking its interaction with WCC. Gradual phosphorylation induces with a delay the dissociation of one FRH, exposing a binding site for WCC and activating the complex. Following a time delay, attributable to the slow and stochastic nature of phosphorylation, the release of the second FRH promotes nuclear export and subsequent degradation of FRQ. This stepwise remodeling ensures precise activation and inactivation of FRQ and positions FRH as a hub for decoding temporal phosphorylation information.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

We used inducible, active forms of TMEM16F to determine the role of lipid scrambling in vesiculation. Plasmalemmal lipid scrambling sufficed to release apoptotic-like vesicles without causing changes in cytosolic calcium or the submembrane cytoskeleton. The scrambled bilayer showed pronounced segregation of exofacial lipids and redistribution of apparent cholesterol to the inner leaflet. The clustering of raft-associated components with bulky headgroups formed domains of outward (convex) curvature, while regions of accumulation of phosphatidylethanolamine generated inward (concave) curvature that facilitated the vesicle scission. Thus, scrambling of plasma membrane lipids suffices to induce regions of acute membrane curvature and facilitates detachment of vesicles analogous to those released from the surface of apoptotic cells.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

While tadpoles acquire their commensal skin bacteria from their mothers, analysis of mitochondrial haplotypes did not explain familial regenerative bias. Levels of endogenous lipopolysaccharides on tail tips were also not predictive of regenerative success, and shotgun sequencing indicated no difference in bacterial loads. To see if microbiome composition correlated with regenerative success, we sequenced 16S rRNA amplicons from 503 tadpole tail tips and mapped these to regenerative outcomes. While no one taxon appeared critical for regenerative success, higher proportions of Gram-positives correlated with successful regeneration.

This behaviour, as well as the ability of SOG1NAC to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner are dependent on its potential to form homodimers and the presence of a cluster of positive charges in its DNA binding site.

During endocytosis, invagination of the plasma membrane is coordinated by a network of proteins that recruit and assemble the clathrin coat. Recent work demonstrated that clathrin accessory proteins which arrive early at endocytic sites, such as Eps15 and Fcho2, form phase-separated condensates that recruit downstream machinery, promoting assembly and maturation of clathrin-coated vesicles. However, the mechanisms by which protein condensates regulate - and are regulated by - clathrin assembly remain unclear. Using in vitro reconstitution and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that protein condensates provide a platform for recruitment and assembly of clathrin triskelia. This condensate driven assembly is enhanced in the presence of the accessory protein, AP2, which is readily incorporated within condensates. In turn, clathrin assembly restricted the growth of condensates, exhibiting surfactant-like behavior that stabilized protein-protein interactions while imposing the preferred curvature of the clathrin lattice. This mutual regulation promotes efficient assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles while preventing uncontrolled expansion of protein condensates. More broadly, reciprocal regulation of protein condensates and clathrin coats may provide a framework for understanding how intrinsically disordered and structured protein assemblies can work together to build complex cellular architectures.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that exposure of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) to physiologically relevant febrile heat stress (39 {degrees}C), derived from patient data, enhances cytoadhesion through increased trafficking of the major virulence factor PfEMP1 to the iRBC surface. This phenomenon is not limited to PfEMP1 and common laboratory strains, as it extends to the surface nutrient channel PSAC in four clinical isolates of diverse geographic origin. The increased surface protein display occurs without changes in overall protein expression or parasite developmental progression. Using phosphoproteomics and proximity labelling, we find that elevated temperature also increases trafficking and phosphorylation of exported proteins into the RBC. Transmembrane domains are likely determinants of enhanced export as shown by NanoLuc reporter assays. Collectively, our results indicate that febrile temperatures commonly experienced during infection can accelerate protein export, likely at the parasitophorous vacuole.

Methods: PIN1 expression was assessed in human CP tissue microarrays (TMAs) via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF). Acute and chronic pancreatitis were induced in wild-type (WT) and PIN1 knockout (PIN1KO) mice using caerulein.

Results: PIN1 expression was elevated in human CP tissues, correlating with disease severity and ADM. In mice, both acute and chronic pancreatitis increased PIN1 expression, but only in our chronic PIN1KO mice displayed reduced pancreatic injury, fibrosis, ADM, and modulated immune infiltration.

Dynein activation requires the multi-subunit dynactin complex and an activating cargo adaptor. The adaptors serve to link dynein with cargo and to fully activate the motor. Mutations in one of these activating adaptors, Bicaudal-D2 (BICD2), are associated with a neurodegenerative disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Lower Extremity Predominance (SMALED2). The molecular defect that underlies SMALED2 is largely unknown. In addition to interacting with dynein, BICD2 has also been shown to associate with KIF5B, a plus-end directed microtubule motor. We hypothesized that interactome changes associated with mutant versions of BICD2, and the resulting differences in cargo transport, might underlie the etiology of SMALED2. To test our hypothesis, we first defined the interactome of wild-type BICD2. This led to the identification of known BICD2 interacting proteins in addition to potentially novel cargo such as components of the HOPS complex, a six-subunit complex involved in endo-lysosomal trafficking. We next determined the interactome of three SMALED2 linked mutants in BICD2, two of which reside in the cargo binding domain. Interestingly, all three mutations resulted in BICD2-mediated dynein hyper-activation. Furthermore, all three mutants were associated with interactome changes. One of these mutants, BICD2_R747C, was deficient in binding to HOPS complex components and the nucleoporin RANBP2. In addition, this mutant also resulted in a gain of function interaction with GRAMD1A, a protein involved in cholesterol metabolism. This gain of function interaction resulted in mis-localization of GRAMD1A in BICD2_R747C expressing cells.

However, unlike conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), sdAbs lack an Fc domain, limiting their functional versatility and manufacturability. To address this challenge, we developed TFDesign-sdAb, a deep learning-based generative-ranking framework that enables rational engineering of sdAbs with tailored functionalities. Our framework integrates a structure-aware diffusion model (IgGM) for large-scale candidate generation and a fine-tuned sorter (A2binder) that evaluates and prioritizes them based on predicted functionality. Unlike traditional CDR-focused approaches, TFDesign-sdAb optimizes both complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FRs), allowing sdAbs to acquire new functional properties while maintaining antigen specificity. We validated our approach by conferring Protein A binding to human VHs and nanobodies that originally lacked this feature, achieving high expression rates, strong binding affinities, and successful purification via industry-standard Protein A affinity chromatography. High-resolution structural characterization (1.49 A and 2.0 A) of the redesigned sdAb-Protein A complexes revealed conserved FR-mediated binding motifs that recapitulate natural Fc-Protein A interactions, validating the accuracy of our model. Furthermore, our pipeline streamlined the antibody engineering process, achieving a 100% success rate in generating Protein A-binding sdAbs while maintaining their original antigen-binding affinity. This work demonstrates the power of AI-driven design in overcoming long-standing limitations in antibody engineering and presents a scalable, generalizable solution for enhancing sdAb functionality.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "The retinotectal projection in Xenopus laevis is topographically organized. During the early development of the Xenopus visual system, the optic tectum increases considerably in volume, and retinotectal axons and dendrites undergo extensive activity-dependent remodeling. We have previously observed marked changes in the three-dimensional layout of the tectal retinotopic functional map over the course of a few days. This raised the question of whether such functional reorganization might be attributable to the migration and structural remodeling of tectal neurons as the brain grows. To examine changes in map topography in the context of individual tectal neuron morphology and location, we performed calcium imaging in the optic tecta of GCaMP6s-expressing tadpoles in parallel with structural imaging of tectal cells that were sparsely labelled with Alexa 594-dextran dye. We performed functional and structural imaging of the optic tectum at two developmental time points, recording the morphology of the dextran-labelled cells and quantifying the changes in their positions and the spanning volume of their dendritic fields. Comparing anatomical growth to changes in the functional retinotopic map at these early stages, we found that dendritic arbor growth kept pace with the overall growth of the optic tectum, and that individual neurons continued to receive widespread visual field input, even as the tectal retinotopic map evolved markedly over time.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

This is especially true for higher-order cortex, where functional interpretations are constrained by narrow hypotheses and anatomical landmarks are often non-homologous. We present a data-driven approach for mapping functional correspondence across species using rich, naturalistic stimuli. By directly comparing macaque electrophysiology with human fMRI responses to 700 natural scenes, we identify fine-grained alignment based on response pattern similarity, without relying on predefined tuning concepts or hand-picked stimuli. As a test case, we examine the ventral face patch system, a well-studied but contested domain in cross-species alignment. Our approach resolves a longstanding ambiguity, yielding a correspondence consistent with full-brain anatomical warping but inconsistent with prior studies limited by narrow functional hypotheses. These findings show that natural image-evoked response patterns provide a robust foundation for cross-species functional alignment, supporting scalable comparisons as large-scale primate recordings become more widespread.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

We can even create plans for reaching goals that we never encountered before. However, the ways the brain addresses goal-directed imagination is largely unknown and current AI methods provide limited solutions to this problem. Here, we introduce a novel computational model -- the generative cognitive map learner (GCML) -- that successful addresses goal-directed imagination and provides a new hypothesis about the brain mechanisms supporting it. The GCML uses stochastic samples from learned cognitive maps -- data structures in which brains encode learned relations between actions and states -- to form trajectories towards both known and novel goals. In a series of simulations, we show that the GCML provides surprisingly effective heuristic solutions to spatial navigation tasks, generic problem solving tasks, and compositional tasks that require generating imagined trajectories to novel goals. The sampled trajectories capture key characteristics of hippocampal replay activity, which provide a candidate mechanism for goal-directed imagination in the brain. Since the GCML only requires simple biologically plausible local synaptic plasticity and shallow neural networks, it can be readily implemented in energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

While machine learning models rely on explicit local error signals to guide weight updates, we do not understand the underlying feedback mechanisms in neurobiology. Here, we propose a simple and biologically plausible solution: local deviations from precise E/I balance encode error signals that instruct synaptic plasticity. Using a computational model derived from an adaptive control theory framework, we show that targeted feedback to inhibitory interneurons perturbing E/I balance can produce neuron or assembly-specific error signals that support credit assignment in multilayer networks. Simulations demonstrate that such a balance-controlled plasticity mechanism is consistent with phenomenological local plasticity models while enabling online learning in hierarchically organized networks. Further, we show this framework is consistent with key features of dis-inhibitory microcircuit dynamics during in-vivo learning experiments. These results suggest that the brain may exploit E/I balance not just for stability, but as a substrate for error-driven learning.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

K.; Gjorgjieva, J.", "abstract": "Excitatory synaptic scaling regulates network dynamics by proportionally adjusting excitatory synaptic strengths after sensory perturbations. During associative learning, blocking excitatory scaling in conditioned taste aversion paradigms prolongs generalized aversive responses and delays memory specificity. Recent evidence also implicates inhibitory synaptic scaling in the regulation of network dynamics. Specifically, parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory neurons, targeting perisomatic regions of excitatory (E) pyramidal neurons, and somatostatin (SST)-expressing neurons, targeting distal dendrites, exhibit distinct scaling responses. This leaves open the question of how complex plasticity mechanisms regulate recurrent excitatory-inhibitory circuit dynamics in associative learning. Using computational approaches, we demonstrate that Hebbian plasticity drives memory generalization to novel stimuli not presented during conditioning. Following conditioning, diverse synaptic scaling mechanisms progressively induce memory specificity, which can be regulated by top-down inputs. Our results reveal that, in the absence of excitatory scaling, PV-to-E scaling can effectively compensate and rescue memory specificity, highlighting the presence of degenerate mechanisms in the brain. Notably, in the process of establishing memory specificity, excitatory scaling and PV-to-E scaling function synergistically, while concurrently opposing SST-to-E scaling. The synergistic and antagonistic plasticity mechanisms are orchestrated to shape the temporal evolution of memory representations, from generalized to precise.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Traditional machine learning methods often rely on single modalities or combine only a limited number (typically two), without aligning them in a unified representation, thereby constraining predictive accuracy. Moreover, most existing approaches are limited to preselected subsets of Gene Ontology (GO) function terms with sufficient annotations, making the prediction of novel function terms a persistent challenge. Here, we present FunBind, a multimodal AI model that jointly learns from protein sequences, textual descriptions, domain annotations, structural features, and GO terms to enhance prediction accuracy and infer previously unseen functions. FunBind operates in two modes: (1) self-supervised pretraining using contrastive learning to align the sequence modality with other heterogeneous modalities in a unified latent space, enabling unsupervised zero-shot function prediction, and (2) supervised fine-tuning that leverages all modalities for comprehensive and accurate function classification. Our results show that FunBind's zero-shot capabilities allow it to generalize effectively to novel function terms never encountered before, while its joint fine-tuning strategy substantially outperforms single-modality models and current state-of-the-art approaches in prediction accuracy.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

While several proposed subtypes of AD exist, there is still no clear consensus on a definitive classification. By leveraging complementary AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised learning, within a recursive pipeline (SUMMER) that integrates multimodal datasets encompassing MRI measurements, phenotypes, and genetic data, our goal was to generate robust scientific evidence for identifying AD subtypes. Data was downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and included neuroimaging data (MRI), genetics (SNPs), clinical diagnosis, and demographics. 1133 European American participants' images, aged 55-95, were included in this study. The analysis was multi-fold, where the first step involved applying an unsupervised application to a subset of the MRI sample (AD + cognitively normal (CN) aged matched groups, 100 men aged 68-85 years, and 76 women aged 68-85 years). The MRI brain gray matter was segmented into 44 regions of interest (ROIs) according to a standard atlas, and 618 features were extracted, including ROI voxel intensity measurements such as minimum, maximum, and histogram variables. Results identified a cluster of subtype AD men and a cluster of subtype AD women that were distinct from the rest of their respective samples. In the next step, the integrity of the identified subtype AD clusters was investigated using the XGBoost supervised machine learning application with genetic features (SNPs, N=36,724) and labels: the identified subtype AD cluster vs. the rest of the sample, stratified by sex. A significant AD subtype men model (accuracy=0.85, F1=0.72, AUC=0.83) and a significant women AD subtype model (accuracy=0.81, F1=0.81, AUC=0.81) were built, confirming the homogeneity of the isolated AD subtype clusters. Discriminative biomarkers were extracted from the significant models, including selected ROIs and SNPs. Finally, the subtype models were tested on an unseen subset of ADNI data. The genetic-based models identified clusters of AD subtype participants consisting of 34% of the men AD group and 47% of the women AD group. Phenotypic analysis indicates that lower body weight was associated with the women's AD subtype. Complex diseases like AD demand a sophisticated, multimodal approach for precise diagnosis.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are used to predict invasion under current and future climates. However, occurrence datasets are often spatially and temporally biased because they are collected in an unstructured and opportunistic manner. Remote sensing individual species over broad spatial and temporal scales has become increasingly feasible with the accumulation of satellite images and the development of convolutional neural networks. In this study, we used 21-years of archival Landsat satellite imagery (2000-2020) to train a temporal convolutional neural network model to predict the probability of occurrence of the invasive species, leafy spurge (Euphorbia virgata), across Minnesota. We validated our predictions with an independent dataset. First, we show that that leafy spurge has expanded from 1,067 km2 occupied in 2000-2002 to 7,156 km2 in 2018-2020, a 570% increase. Surprisingly, drought severity modulated the predicted area invaded and was associated with fluctuations over the study period. Second, we tracked changes in probability over time for individual pixels and showed that invasion has been concentrated in two largely disjunct regions of Minnesota. Third, our remotely-sensed occurrence dataset and community science dataset were biased to roadsides, although the latter was more severely biased. Last, we showed that SDMs built using remotely-sensed occurrences had higher discrimination, were less overfit, and had higher performance outside of urban areas.

To address this gap, we used the mustard-feeding drosophilid fly Scaptomyza flava, which feeds on toxic Brassicales plants like wasabi that produce noxious, electrophilic isothiocyanates (ITCs or mustard oils). We found that S. flava exhibits dramatically reduced behavioral sensitivity to allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) compared to its microbe-feeding relatives Scaptomyza pallida and Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesized that molecular evolution of the \"wasabi receptor\" TRPA1, known to perceive ITCs in flies, could explain this loss of aversion. Our experiments revealed three interconnected evolutionary genetic changes consistent with this hypothesis. First, TRPA1 was expressed in labellar tissues of S. flava at the lowest levels among the three species, at a nearly four-fold lower level than in D. melanogaster. Second, S. flava expressed a higher proportion of TRPA1 splice variants previously reported to be less sensitive to chemical stimulus. Third, we identified amino acid substitutions in S. flava that could influence the structure of intracellular domains of TRPA1. To test the functional salience of these mechanisms in vitro and in vivo, we validated TRPA1 splicing isoforms using Xenopus oocyte electrophysiology and the GAL4/UAS system in D. melanogaster. Single isoform electrophysiology indeed revealed evolution of TRPA1 in the S. flava lineage towards reduced electrophile sensitivity. Ectopic expression of S. flava TRPA1 in D. melanogaster consistently conferred weaker AITC sensitivity in vivo than expression of its orthologues, although this did not fully recapitulate differences in wild-type phenotypes between the species suggesting other molecular evolutionary mechanisms were involved. Finally, we explored the consequences of isoform co-expression using oocyte electrophysiology. We found that enrichment of electrophile-insensitive TRPA1 splicing isoforms as observed in S. flava can additively reduce cellular responses to AITC, which could further contribute to reduced electrophile aversion. Our findings illuminate how expression differences, protein structural changes, and especially alternative splicing, together can drive sensory evolution as animals behaviorally adapt to toxic new niches.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

A single threshold ([&ge;]0.26) identifies 40 high-risk candidates with a 90.0% clinical failure rate, compared to 72.9% across the cohort, corresponding to a 1.23-fold enrichment for failure. Pre-excluding these outliers would have improved overall clinical success from 27.1% to 30.6% (~13% relative uplift). Importantly, VIBE1 is only weakly correlated with existing assays and provides orthogonal insight into failure risk, often flagging antibodies missed by standard panels. Correlation with in silico predicted structure-based descriptors in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) suggests VIBE1 maybe driven by electrostatic and hydrophobic surface properties. 2. We establish that each assay yields multiple high-signal-to-noise (SNR) descriptors that are internally consistent, partially overlapping, and capture diverse aspects of biophysical behaviour. These form a stable, ML-ready biophysical fingerprint--suitable for predictive modelling, latent property inference, and mechanistic interpretation. While this paper stops short of training ML models, it defines the coordinate structure of this new descriptor space and makes a curated subset of features publicly available to enable independent evaluation. Together, these results position the VIBE assay as a minimal-material, multiplexed biophysical platform. The VIBE1 descriptor is ready for adoption by antibody developers as a conservative triage tool, while the broader descriptor landscape provides a new data layer for AI-native approaches to molecular profiling.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Through an extensive experimental effort and computational annotation projection, tens of thousands of genes have been annotated across plant species, with most of the gene annotations focusing on a well-studied species, Arabidopsis thaliana, but this represents a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of genes across these different plant species. Phenotypes and their traits result from multiple processes and events involving multiscale information encoded from different omics, such as genomes, proteomes, or transcriptomes. This stresses a need for an efficient computational approach to capture and integrate information from biological networks and transfer this knowledge from well-studied species to unknown species to annotate and discover functional relationships between phenotypes and genes. Despite recent progress, existing methods only consider one or a few omics levels to perform reasoning on functional annotation-to-gene relations. The main objective of this study is to generate and explore a large-scale plant biological knowledge graph, the DasDB, and to enrich gene functional annotation linked to genes in different species using graph neural networks (GNNs). Integrating various data sources from different omics has resulted in a comprehensive graph database, facilitating researchers' in-depth understanding of complex biological networks at the highest level. In addition, applying GNNs on a large-scale knowledge graph database has shown promise in the ability of deep learning models to transfer this information from well-studied plant species to less-characterized plant species. This study benchmarks a new research direction in producing new functional annotation discovery in plant species with limited functional annotations. This pipeline was applied to a specific research problem: the mechanism involved in pea nodule nitrogen fixation. We managed to identify known gene markers of this process through a systematic analysis of the DasDB, showing the relevance of our approach. Furthermore, new potential targets to better understand and improve this process were identified.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Recalcitrant cellulose molecules are broken down by microorganisms that colonize the herbivore gut, releasing greenhouse gasses in the process. Passalid beetles are tropical herbivores that feed only on decaying wood and present subsocial behavior that may lead to the acquisition and sharing of microbial symbionts for efficient biomass and energy production. We collected five groups of Veturius sp. Passalid beetles from different logs in the Costa Rican rainforest and analyzed the microbial communities of larval and adult guts, as well as the substrate material in which they resided (partially chewed wood material mixed with feces that covers their tunnels). Adults, larvae, and substrate harbor different microbial communities, with substrate showing the highest diversity and richness, and larvae gut comprising a high abundance of methanogenic archaea. Reconstructed metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) revealed that larvae and adults are enriched in genomes encoding a myriad of glycosyl hydrolases. Methanogenic taxa were enriched within the larval MAGs and bins, suggesting that larval microbiota participate in the final steps of cellulose decomposition in the system. Finally, we assessed methane production rates by Passalid beetles and compared them with termites. Our results show that Passalid larvae and adults produce methane at rates comparable to termites.

Yet, interpreting eNA detections requires understanding of their environmental persistence. We conducted a decay experiment using seawater from an open dolphin enclosure to track degradation of six eNA components derived from Tursiops truncatus: mitochondrial eDNA of varying lengths, ribosomal eRNA, and messenger eRNA. Targets were quantified over seven days via digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). Decay followed a biphasic exponential model with rapid initial loss (~48 hours at 15C), followed by slower degradation. Cytb messenger eRNA was least stable, disappearing within four hours. Ribosomal eRNA persisted longer but degraded slightly faster than its eDNA counterpart (lambda = 0.125 per hour vs. 0.105 per hour). Longer eDNA fragments decayed more rapidly (lambda = 0.121 per hour) than shorter ones (lambda = 0.083 per hour). These findings support the use of eDNA fragment length as a proxy for degradation state and reinforce that combining multiple eNA components with distinct stabilities can provide a molecular clock framework for inferring the eNA age. This approach improves the spatiotemporal resolution of eNA-based monitoring, particularly for rare species that act as point sources. We also emphasize the importance of explicitly distinguishing between RNA types (ribosomal vs. messenger) in environmental studies, given their divergent stability and interpretability.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Elucidating the interspecies differences in response to FMDV infection is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of the virus. In this study, we report that FMDV infection in horse epithelial cells induces the production of lactate, which modulates the function of VDAC1 protein through lactylation, facilitating the release of mtDNA from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. This process activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, which stimulates interferon-{beta} expression and suppresses FMDV replication.

Primary cells became characterized by dense accumulations of apical F-actin that we termed Apical Ribs of Actin Fibers (ARAFs).

ARAFs are contractile, stress-fiber-like, and connect to adherens junctions. Impairing ARAFs indicated that this network maintains cortical tension and is crucial for primary cells to achieve their characteristic shapes. Our evaluation of the three-dimensional shape of primary cells reveals that ARAFs are essential for the rounding and elevation of the apical membrane.

Despite its importance, how the assembly of the leaf microbial community is modified by environmental conditions such as nutrient availability remains relatively uninvestigated. Soil nutrient availability may shift the outcome of microbial interactions within a host individual or influence the pool of microbes across the plant community. We hypothesized that leaf microbial diversity would increase across the season as leaves collect additional taxa, and that this seasonal assembly would be sensitive to nutrient addition. To assess this, we tracked the assembly of the fungal phyllosphere microbiome of the grass tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) in old-field vegetation over the growing season and experimentally tested whether the seasonality of the microbiome was modified by experimental addition of soil nutrients. Fungal diversity (Shannon diversity index, richness, and evenness) increased early in the season, with most metrics saturating before the end of the season. Community composition as measured by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity also shifted over the early and mid-growing season. Phylogeny-based machine-learning identified fungal lineages that were abundant in different seasons, linking seasonal community shifts to their evolutionary context. Nutrient addition was less important than time of season, but still significantly altered community composition and interacted with time to influence richness, with lowest richness in the low nutrient addition plots early in the season. The clear seasonality of the microbiome provides support for a dynamic phyllosphere microbiome, suggesting further studies manipulating fungal recruitment over the season. Furthermore, it highlights the robustness of seasonal assembly to variation in nutrient availability.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

However, effective incorporation of such multivariate observations is mainly hindered by the inherent sparsity and variability of observation matrices characterized by low overlap in observation types between different experiments, due to tissue consumption and cost of whole-organism experiments. Results: We analyzed the potential of bayesian hierarchical ODE models to estimate model parameters from sparse, non-overlapping, multivariate, time resolved datasets subject to experimental variability. The dataset in this study consisted of time series of chemical residue, gene-expression and survival obtained from 5 years of chemical exposure experiments with zebrafish embryos. Using the hierarchical approach, it was possible to increase the number of observations used in the model because experimental deviations in the exposure concentration could be accounted for. We identified inadequate dynamics of the uptake and metabolization kinetics in the ODE system, which led to strong overfitting when coupled to the hierarchical approach when wide prior distributions for the experimental error were used. In contrast, narrow distribution for the experimental error successfully avoided overfitting, despite model inadequacy. An additional simulation study of an adequate model confirmed that hierarchical models estimate parameters with low (10%) bias even under complete sparsity (i.e. no experimental overlap between measured variables); filling even small amounts (2.5%) of the missing information further reduced the parameter bias to (5%).

Espinosa, J.", "abstract": "Phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids into biomolecular condensates contributes to the regulation of cellular compartmentalisation in membrane-less environments. A key parameter controlling the onset of biomolecular condensate formation via liquid--liquid phase separation is the saturation concentration (Csat)--the threshold concentration above which condensation takes place. While measuring Csat for protein solutions in vitro is experimentally accessible, determining this quantity in simulations remains challenging due to the extremely low equilibrium concentrations at which many proteins phase separate. This occurs because the gold standard in simulations consists on combining a residue-resolution coarse-grained model with the Direct Coexistence simulation method, which yields poor estimates of the equilibrium concentrations of the dilute phase due to lack of statistics. In this work, we present two independent thermodynamic integration (TI) schemes which, when combined with Direct Coexistence simulations, enable accurate calculation of saturation concentrations and phase diagrams--facilitating direct comparison with experimental measurements across a wide range of conditions. Our methods, combined with the Mpipi-Recharged residue-resolution coarse-grained model, accurately estimate Csat for a wide range of intrinsically disordered and multi-domain proteins, including disease-associated RNA- and DNA-binding proteins involved in the formation of stress granules and P granules, as well as engineered mutants of hnRNPA1. Furthermore, we compare our TI methods against a computationally efficient machine-learning predictor trained to estimate saturation concentrations at sub-physiological temperatures. While both approaches yield realistic predictions, explicit molecular dynamics simulations enable the calculation of complete phase diagrams and provide insight into the molecular mechanisms and interactions driving phase-separation. Overall, our approach offers a robust, physically grounded framework for improving and validating coarse-grained models of biomolecular phase behaviour, effectively bridging the gap between simulation and experiment.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

While these behavioral detriments have been modeled in rodents, the underlying functional alterations in the developing brain are largely unknown. Previous reports using a rat model have identified alterations to both inhibitory synaptic transmission and serotonergic (5-HT) receptor binding in the cortex following developmental CPF exposure. Here, we use a rat model of gestational CPF exposure to investigate whether this altered inhibitory activity is driven by increased spontaneous firing of inhibitory interneurons and altered 5-HT receptor expression. Using cell-attached ex vivo electrophysiology in young rats of both sexes, we identified a significant increase in the number of spontaneously firing neurons in the somatosensory cortex of CPF-exposed offspring. Analysis of action potential metrics identified a sub-set of these neurons as fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. Immunohistochemical labeling of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activity, further revealed a pronounced increase in activity of neurons of the somatosensory cortex in both juvenile and adult rats that had been gestationally exposed to CPF. Finally, RNAscope in situ hybridization showed an increase in the expression of the inhibitory receptor 5-HT1B in PV neurons. The data here demonstrate that gestational exposure to CPF results in persistent hyper-excitation of the somatosensory cortex, potentially through increased expression of the receptor 5-HT1B and resulting disinhibition. These neurophysiological effects may contribute to the established behavioral outcomes resulting from gestational exposure to CPF and offer guidance for novel preventative interventions.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Whilst its antiviral mechanism-of-action is well defined, host pharmacogenetic factors that regulate its therapeutic responses - efficacy as well as selectivity - have not been mechanistically deciphered and characterized. Here we identified that uridine cytidine kinase (UCK), the first and rate-limiting kinase of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, could effectively phosphorylate N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), the active compound of molnupiravir, and thereby dictate its anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy, as well as its selectivity index. Using target engagement and enzyme kinetic assays, we demonstrate that recombinant UCK isoform 1 (UCK1) and 2 (UCK2) effectively bind and phosphorylate NHC, with UCK2 displaying 9-fold higher catalytic efficiency. Accordingly, in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, downregulation of UCK2 via siRNA hampered the intracellular accumulation of the triphosphate antiviral metabolite of NHC, resulting in 10-fold reduction of antiviral efficacy. Furthermore, we could recapitulate this using a pan-UCK small molecule inhibitor. Critically, both UCK downregulation and inhibition significantly reduced the selectivity index of molnupiravir/NHC. Altogether, this work underscores the pivotal roles of UCK enzymes in upholding molnupiravir efficacy and therapeutic window, and furthermore, highlights their potential as pharmacologically tractable targets for tailoring the therapeutic response to this antiviral agent.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

{"title": "Pain and touch differentially modulate corticospinal excitability, independent of afferent inhibition", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.09.653032", "authors": "Gwynne, L.; Tame, L.", "abstract": "Pain can profoundly impact motor functioning to support self-preservation but is also associated with motor and somatosensory disturbances. Despite considerable research exploring the influence of pain and touch on motor and sensorimotor processes, the nature of this relationship remains elusive. Specifically, it is uncertain whether pain and touch modulate motor processes independently of each other or are interconnected. Across two experiments, an afferent inhibition (AI) paradigm was tested to probe the effects of tactile and nociceptive inputs on corticospinal processes and sensorimotor interactions. In Experiment 1 (N=20), the effect of electrocutaneous stimulation duration (0.2 vs. 0.4 ms) on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced corticospinal excitability (CSE) was assessed using a short and long-latency AI paradigm. A single electrocutanous stimulus was delivered to the left index finger before single pulse-TMS over the right-first dorsal interosseous (FDI) motor hotspot at one of five delays (15, 25, 35, 45, 60 or 160 ms). In Experiment 2 (N=20), the same paradigm was used to examine if this effect of sensorimotor interaction is changed when moderate tonic heat pain is delivered to the forearm. Significant AI was observed in both experiments at delays of 25, 35 and 160 ms, with afferent facilitation at 60 ms. This effect was not influenced by the duration of afferent stimulation (Experiment 1) nor by the presence of heat pain (Experiment 2). However, we found a significant reduction in CSE in painful compared to painless conditions, indicating that while tonic pain modulates CSE, tactile afferent inhibition remains unaffected. This supports the notion that pain has a direct (inhibitory) effect on motor output; however, in this context, tactile sensorimotor interactions remain unaltered.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

It remains unclear how trained immunity influences IBD pathogenesis and whether it can be harnessed therapeutically. In our study, pretreatment with {beta}-glucan reprogrammed bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors and peripheral monocytes, inducing a profound shift in monocyte plasticity and significantly reducing the severity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow or peripheral monocytes from {beta}-glucan-trained mice into naive mice conferred robust protection against colitis, demonstrating that this protective effect is transferable. Trained mice also displayed improved clearance of intestinal bacterial infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an expansion of reparative Cx3cr1+ macrophages derived from Ly6Chi monocytes, correlating with accelerated colonic epithelial regeneration. Collectively, these findings reveal how {beta}-glucan-induced trained immunity modulates monocyte differentiation to ameliorate experimental colitis, highlighting the potential of harnessing trained immunity as a therapeutic strategy to recalibrate innate immune responses and restore gut homeostasis in IBD, shedding light for future clinical applications.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

The mice were fed with the oxalate precursor hydroxyproline for 23 weeks at which time we assessed pathological changes in the kidney and heart. We demonstrate that Oxf reduces plasma oxalate (pOx) and creatinine levels, mitigates inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney, and reduces pathologic cardiac remodeling in the hearts of CKD mice. RNA-seq analysis of ventricular tissue of CKD mice reveals dysregulated expression of metabolic pathways while Oxf colonization reverses these changes.

Self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles (SANPs) have emerged as promising candidates due to their unique structural properties, which enhance membrane interaction, drug loading, and therapeutic accumulation. The structural diversity and tunable properties of SANPs provide a flexible design platform for antibacterial applications. However, navigating the vast chemical space of SANPs remains a significant challenge due to the complex structure-activity relationships. To address this, we developed PolyCLOVER, a deep learning-guided framework for the efficient discovery of antibacterial SANPs. The framework integrates multi-stage self-supervised learning, active learning, and high-throughput experimentation to iteratively guide the discovery of SANPs with potent antibacterial activity and low toxicity. Through this framework, we identified three potent SANPs within a combinatorial library of ~100,000 poly({beta}-amino ester)s, with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 4 g/mL and 8 g/mL against clinically multidrug-resistant S. aureus and A. baumannii, respectively. Moreover, they can also act as antibiotic carriers, restoring the sensitivity of pathogens to penicillin G. In vivo studies demonstrated their therapeutic efficacy both as monotherapies and in combination therapies with antibiotics.

Such metabolic interactions manifest in growth effects such as competitive exclusion or cooperative growth boost. However, intra-cellular molecular changes that underpin these responses are very sparsely studied, preventing mechanistic insights into community function and dynamics. Here, we analyse meta-proteomics and metabolomic responses in 104 pairwise co-cultures of 15 diverse gut bacteria in a nutrient-rich medium. These co-cultures span a diversity of ecological interactions with competition, amensalism and exploitation being prominent, and with around one in five positive interactions. The species in co-cultures feature substantial molecular responses, with typically more than 60% of the proteome changing in response to at least one partner. Even closely related species and ortholog proteins show different expression profiles in response to the same partner indicating functional diversification at both protein and species level. We show that the magnitude of these responses is determined by genome size, species abundance, and pH. Small-molecule transport and carbon metabolism are among the most responsive processes indicating pervasive metabolic interactions. Using metabolomics, we identify likely cross-fed metabolites, emergent polyamine metabolism, and niche partitioning in amino acid utilisation.

Two colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were developed to detect PMMoV, one targeting the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (PMMoV_RdRp) and one targeting the coat protein (PMMoV_CP). Synthetic gBlock positive controls were used to determine the detection limit of each assay. PMMoV_RdRp detected PMMoV at concentrations greater than or equal to 100 copies/L, the same sensitivity as the RT-PCR assay for this gene. In contrast, the detection limit of the PMMoV_CP RT-LAMP assay was an order of magnitude greater. Both assays were specific to PMMoV and did not amplify plant host tissue or related tobamoviruses. Since these RT-LAMP assays do not require specialized laboratory equipment and yield positive results within 20-30 minutes, they are advantageous for point-of-use testing. Overall, the RT-LAMP assays described here are sensitive, specific, and more rapid than existing methods for PMMoV detection and quantification and thus have potential widespread applications for agriculture, wastewater treatment assessment, recreational water quality testing, and food safety.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

We investigated the activity and impact of FoHeli1, a Helitron transposable element in the TR4 lineage, focusing on a Mozambican TR4 strain (M1) through a combination of genome analyses, metabolite profiling, and infection assays. FoHeli1 activity has been very recent within the TR4 lineage and is likely still ongoing.

T.; Woodward, J. J.; Tang, Q.", "abstract": "Anti-folate antibiotics are used to treat meningitis and refractory listeriosis caused by drug-resistant Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Their bactericidal activity is attributed to the deactivation of thymidylate synthase (ThyA), which subsequently induces bacterial cell death when thymidine is depleted, a process known as thymineless death (TLD). Despite decades of study, the mechanisms of TLD, especially during infection, remain unclear. Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), a common bacterial second messenger that regulates bacterial stress responses, is elevated in response to anti-folate antibiotics. In this study, we found that elevated c-di-AMP is required to inhibit TLD in Lm. Conversely, reducing c-di-AMP levels in the {Delta}thyA mutant led to increased bacterial cell death under thymidine starvation and significant reduction in intracellular growth. Furthermore, we found that {Delta}thyA exhibited a more pronounced growth defect during oral infection compared to intravenous infection, due to limited thymidine availability in the gallbladder, which acts as a bottleneck for {Delta}thyA in establishing infection. Notably, decreasing c-di-AMP levels abolished the infection capacity of {Delta}thyA in both infection models. Finally, we identified that the c-di-AMP-binding protein PstA contributes to bacterial cell death when c-di-AMP concentrations are low. Deletion of pstA in the {Delta}thyA background rescued the elevated cell death caused by c-di-AMP depletion both in vitro and during mouse infections. Our study identifies a previously unrecognized mechanism of TLD regulation mediated by c-di-AMP. This expands fundamental knowledge of TLD in the context of infection and provides insight into potential combined therapeutic strategies for listeriosis targeting both anti-folate and c-di-AMP metabolic pathways.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

The corrosion incorporates two pathways, i.e., chemical and biological oxidation of H2S to sulfuric acid; however, their rates are difficult to differentiate on corroded sewer pipelines, limiting understanding and application of effective strategies for corrosion control. Here, this study develops and reports a kinetic approach to determining rates of chemical and biological sulfide oxidation. By measuring the total sulfide uptake rate of sewer corrosion concretes, extensive experimental data was obtained for calibration and validation of the proposed kinetic model. The modelling results fit with measured data indicating that both chemical and biological sulfide oxidation can be well-described by the developed model. Model predictions revealed that along with sewer corrosion (i.e., pH decrease), chemical sulfide oxidation rate was significantly accelerated, along with an increase in biological rate. This result suggests that the chemical sulfide oxidation process should not be overlooked for seriously corroded concretes, and synergistic strategies to suppress both biological and chemical rates are required. Specifically, the chemical process can predominate sulfide oxidation with a gas-H2S concentration higher than 300 ppm.

This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis, in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine/methionine) or inorganic sulfate, robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acid as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a C. albicans mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase (Pfk1) exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis.

We then set two minimum conservation targets for each species: first a population-based target that estimates the proportion of the AOH needed to conserve 1,000 mature individuals (or the total population if smaller) to prevent extinction; and second, an area-based target that estimates the amount of habitat needed to sustain the long-term conservation of each species. The AOH maps were then overlaid with existing protected areas to identify those species that do not yet have their minimum conservation targets met. Using this approach, we identified 10 species that require additional protection to avoid extinction, and a further 54 species that need expanded protection for sustained conservation. Fortunately, the majority of species already met their target. We also ran a prioritization analysis to identify and map the places most important for meeting the goals of the under-protected species. We found that just 661.4 km2 is needed to meet population-based targets for the ten species of greatest concern, and 16,360 km2 is needed to meet area-based targets for all under-protected species combined. These areas represent <0.1% of the region's land area and are mostly concentrated in five countries (Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil).

A recent study identified a K76E mutation in PPIA in sporadic ALS patients, but its effects on protein function and structure remain unclear. In this study, we used biochemical and biophysical techniques to investigate the structural and functional consequences of the K76E mutation. Our results show that K76E significantly reduces enzyme activity without affecting structure, monodispersity, or substrate recognition. Significant effects of K76E mutation were identified by relaxation dispersion NMR experiments, showing that K76E disrupts key protein dynamics and alters an allosteric network essential for isomerase activity. Corroborated by theoretical kinetic analysis, this dynamics data, revealing the exchange process for K76E approximately one-tenth that of the wild type, explain the reduced cis-trans isomerase activity of the K76E mutant.

V.; Maier, W.; Rubin, A. F.", "abstract": "Background: Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) assays can systematically assess the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein function. While DMS datasets have been generated for many targets, they often suffer from incomplete variant coverage due to technical constraints, limiting their utility in variant interpretation and downstream analyses. Results: We developed VEFill, a gradient boosting model for imputing missing DMS scores across protein domains. VEFill is trained on the Human Domainome 1 dataset, a large, standardized set of DMS experiments using a uniform stability-based assay, and integrates a broad set of additional biologically informative features including ESM-1v sequence embeddings, evolutionary conservation (EVE scores), amino acid substitution matrices, and physicochemical descriptors. The model achieved robust predictive performance (R squared = 0.64, Pearson r = 0.80). It also demonstrated reliable generalization to unseen proteins in other stability-based datasets, while showing weaker performance on activity-based assays. Per-protein models further confirmed VEFill's effectiveness under limited-data conditions. A reduced two-feature version using only ESM-1v embeddings and mean DMS scores performed comparably to the full model, suggesting a computationally efficient alternative. However, true zero-shot prediction without positional context remains a challenge, particularly for functionally complex proteins. Conclusions: VEFill offers an interpretable, scalable framework for DMS score imputation, especially effective in stability-focused and sparse-data settings. It enables systematic mutation prioritization and may support the design of efficient experimental libraries for variant effect studies.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

To aid forensic experts in their investigations, an image recognition model for microtrace localisation and classification is needed. In this work, we use deep learning to automate trace recognition in images captured with automated microscopy.

As deep learning requires extensive amounts of annotated training data, we additionally investigate various pretraining strategies to minimise the required annotation workload. We compare ImageNet pretraining, pretraining with self-supervised learning and a sequential application of these approaches. We find that pretrained models are able to reduce the required annotated data twofold compared to models trained from scratch while retaining the prediction accuracy. While our ImageNet-pretrained models outperform our self-supervised-pretrained models, we achieve the highest accuracy by combining the two approaches, resulting in a factor of 4 reduction of manual annotated microtraces or a 65% improvement in recognition and localisation accuracy (mean intersection over union increases from 0.34 to 0.56 due to pretraining) when training on only 2.2 dm2 of annotated tape lift scans.

The self-attention of Transformer extracts features and patterns from trajectories, and the cross-attention of Transformer captures matching relations between history tracks and future hypothesis tracklets (fragments of track). Our tracker uses the Transformer to handle the tracking of particles with diverse motion dynamics, and outperforms existing tracking algorithms in terms of accuracy. Furthermore,the tracker utilizes estimated particle positions to counteract missed detections, thereby improving tracking robustness under varying ratios of missing detections.

Recently, clustering and subsampling techniques that manipulate multiple sequence alignment (MSA) inputs into AlphaFold to generate conformational ensembles of proteins have also been proposed. Although many of these techniques have been made open source, they often require integrating multiple packages and can be challenging for researchers who have a limited programming background to employ. This is especially true when researchers are interested in subsampling to produce predictions of protein conformational ensembles, which require multiple computational steps. This manuscript introduces FastConformation, a Python-based application that integrates MSA generation, structure prediction via AF2, and interactive analysis of protein conformations and their distributions, all in one place. FastConformation is accessible through a user-friendly GUI suitable for non-programmers, allowing users to iteratively refine subsampling parameters based on their analyses to achieve diverse conformational ensembles. Starting from an amino acid sequence, users can make protein conformation predictions and analyze results in just a few hours on their local machines, which is significantly faster than traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Uniquely, by leveraging the subsampling of MSAs, our tool enables the generation of alternative protein conformations. We demonstrate the utility of FastConformation on proteins including the Abl1 kinase, LAT1 transporter, and CCR5 receptor, showcasing its ability to predict and analyze the protein conformational ensembles and effects of mutations on a variety of proteins.

This study proposes a pioneering self-theranostic strategy using Magnesium-28 (Mg-28) alone, enabling simultaneous diagnosis, therapy, and therapy control. Exploiting the elevated Mg2+ demand in cancer cells, Mg-28 self-targets Mg-dependent enzymes (e.g., DNA/RNA polymerases, hexokinase, telomerase) within intracellular organelles like the nucleus and mitochondria, without bio-chemical carriers or nanoparticles as recently methods. A theoretical model, based on the Mg-uptake coefficient, predicts selective Mg-28 accumulation in tumors following intravenous administration. The Mg-28 chain decays into Aluminum-28 then Silicon-28, delivering highly localized irradiation via beta particles, Auger electrons, and recoil ions to critical intracellular structures, while disrupting essential Mg-dependent enzymes for a dual mechanism of radiotherapy and multi-enzyme inactivation. Simulations of Linear Energy Transfer (LET), radiation range, and absorbed dose show that nanogram-scale amounts of Mg-28 can deliver 60-400 Gy to tumors ranging from 0.03 mg to 500 g in size, suggesting potential cytotoxicity that could be effective across not only a broad range of stages but also types of cancer due to the fundamental role of magnesium in cancer cell metabolism and proliferation. Mg-28 and its daughter's gamma emissions support early tumor detection and real-time treatment monitoring, enhancing precision. As the first proposed single-isotope theranostic approach leveraging magnesium dependency, this innovative strategy provides a robust foundation for future preclinical and clinical investigations aimed at validating its therapeutic efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and biosafety inaugurating a novel hypothesis for cancer therapy.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

However, NMD's importance also extends to the control of isoform abundance under physiological conditions. During viral infection, NMD is inhibited through numerous mechanisms; however, NMD has been shown to have both antiviral as well as proviral activities, raising further questions into the role and control of NMD during viral infection. These observations have led us to investigate the potential involvement of NMD in dsRNA sensing as a mechanism that might explain these discrepancies. Using EIF4A2 exon 10B inclusion as an example of AS-NMD isoform accumulating during viral infection, we show that dsRNA sensing inhibits NMD. This effect is correlated with translational blockade and is driven primarily by RNaseL activation, and by PKR in the absence of RNaseL activation. Surprisingly, NMD promotes the induction of IFN-{beta} as well as interferon-stimulated genes, and this effect is upstream of IRF3 translocation to the nucleus. NMD also promotes RNaseL activation, suggesting NMD directly controls dsRNA sensing. Therefore, inhibition of NMD upon dsRNA sensing provides a negative feedback loop that contributes to shaping the innate immune sensing pathways.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Mild weight loss, and lung inflammation including consolidation and alveolar thickening were evident 3 days post-infection (dpi) and inflammation persisted to 7 dpi. Coinciding with early monocytic infiltrates, CCL2 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) were transiently produced 3 dpi, while IL-12 and CCL5 persisted to 7 dpi, modeling viral and inflammatory phases of disease. Neutralization of TGF-{beta}, but not IL-10 or IL-4, significantly increased lung inflammatory monocytes and elevated serum but not lung IL-6. Neutralization of IL-4 prolonged weight loss and increased early perivascular infiltration without changing viral titer.

These fungi are cost-effective and eco-friendly for vector control, providing an alternative to synthetic chemical insecticides. They have great potential as larvicides against malaria vectors, but their impacts on mosquito fitness have not been fully measured. This study evaluated the effect of Metarhizium fungal strains, locally isolated in Burkina Faso, on the larval survival of the mosquito Anopheles coluzzii, the life history of the emerging adults and on the maternal effects of exposed females. Methods: We assessed the efficacy of Metarhizium pingshaense (strains S10 and S26) conidia against An. coluzzii larvae. First,larvae were reare in the presence of fungal spores and the survival of the larvae and adults that emerged, their wing length, oviposition rate and blood feeding behaviour were measured. Additionally, we assessed the efficacy of fungal strains S10 and S26 conidia against An. coluzzii adults by spraying them with spore suspensions and assessing the survival of their larval offspring. Survival data was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model, while other life history traits using generalized linear mixed models. Results: The fungal suspension applied to the water in which the larvae were reared caused mortality at the pupae stage. Only a small number of larvae emerged to reach adulthood. Furthermore, at the adult stage, these mosquitoes exhibited reduced survival compared to the control. However, body size and blood-feeding behavior were not affected by the treatment;In contrast, the number of eggs layed was more abundant in infected group compared to controls. Although infected adult mosquitoes laid significantly more eggs than the controls, a lower proportion of larvae successfully developed into adults. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the potential of Metarhizium pingshaense conidia have potential to use for mosquito larval control. Metarhizium could therefore be part of the arsenal of integrated vector management. Future work should focus on the molecular mechanism of the fungal infection at the larval stage to improve formulation or genetically engineer the conidia of these strains to make them more virulent.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

We established a simple and inexpensive PCR tool, named CanID-PCR, to speciate Candida directly from positive blood bottles. We selected Candida ACT1 gene, which has an intron with varying length that enables the identification of 10 common Candida species.

Anelloviruses are postulated to interact with the host cell nuclear transport machinery, however, the lack of reliable cell culture models strongly limits our knowledge regarding Anelloviridae-host interactions. In particular, capsid nuclear import is a largely uncharacterized process. We addressed this by investigating the relationship between host cell nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) and ORF1, the putative capsid protein from torque teno douroucouli virus (TTDoV). We identified the subcellular targeting signals and NTRs responsible for its nucleolar and nuclear localization, and characterized their relative contribution to ORF1 subcellular localization. In the absence of other viral proteins, ORF1 accumulated in the nucleoli. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the highly conserved N-terminal arginine rich motif (ARM) (''NLSn'', 27-RRWRRRPRRRRRPYRRRPYRRYGRRRKVRRR-57), and an additional C-terminal NLS (''NLSc'', 632-LPPPEKRARWGF-643), which has been specifically acquired by Anelloviridae capsids with larger projection domains. Such NLSs play distinct roles in ORF1 subcellular localization. NLSn features broad importin (IMP) binding affinity yet plays a minor role in nuclear import, being responsible for nucleolar targeting likely through interaction with nucleolar components. NLSc specifically interacts with IMP and is the main driver of active nuclear transport in an IMP/{beta}1-dependent fashion. These findings suggest an evolutionary correlation between the acquisition of progressively larger projection domains and the presence of additional NLSs in Anelloviridae capsids, aimed at maximizing IMP/{beta}1-mediated nuclear import.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

One of the promising targets is microbial polysaccharides, which are abundant structures in bacterial and fungal cells. Their rapid and inexpensive analysis, however, is complicated. This study focused on detecting microbial polysaccharides, such as lipopolysaccharides, using MALDI-TOF MS and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We developed a method for fingerprinting polysaccharides by acid hydrolysis and enzymatic digestion.

Next, degranulation assays revealed that IFN{gamma}hi CTLs displayed significantly higher surface expression of the lytic granule marker CD107a (33.75%) compared to IFN{gamma}lo CTLs (3.76%), despite comparable intracellular GzmB levels. This suggests that elevated IFN{gamma} production correlates with CTL killing capacity. Further analysis demonstrated that IFN{gamma}hi CTLs exhibited extensive colocalization with cis-Golgi and GzmB, indicating robust IFN{gamma} synthesis and efficient sorting of mature IFN{gamma} into cytotoxic granules (CGs) relative to IFN{gamma}lo CTLs. Finally, we compared IFN{gamma} and CRTAM expression in naive versus activated CD8+ T cells upon TCR stimulation, demonstrating that transient CRTAM expression may critically regulate initial CTL activation and IFN{gamma} production.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Large-scale field trials conducted from 2019 to 2022 in Quebec (Canada) demonstrated significant reductions in D. radicum infestations in radish and daikon crops. Quality control measures confirmed the effectiveness of sterilization, with minimal impact on male performance. The results suggest that the SIT is a promising, environmentally friendly alternative to chemical control for cabbage maggot management.

L.; Vandenplas, J.; Adriaens, I.; Zetouni, L.; Orrett, C.; de Haas, Y.; Kamphuis, C.; Gredler-Grandl, B.", "abstract": "Heat stress is a major environmental challenge affecting dairy cattle, leading to behavioral changes, production losses, and welfare concerns. As heat stress events intensify and become more frequent due to climate change, identifying heat tolerant animals is crucial for sustainable dairy production. This study develops a pipeline to quantify the population-wise impact of heat stress on a dairy cattle population and subsequently defines individual-based heat tolerance traits. Data from 677,318 Dutch Holstein cows, including 15.6 million mid-infrared spectra and 762 million records from automated milking systems, were analyzed. An iterative approach using kernel regression was employed to estimate the population-wise effects of heat stress. Results indicate that fat and protein percentages decrease approximately linearly with increasing temperature humidity index (THI) with an absolute reduction of 0.3% from THI = 30 to THI = 70. In contrast, milk yield remains stable until a THI of 60, after which production losses increase quadratically reaching 5.0% at a THI of 75. The phenotype of an animal is subsequently defined as the slope in a linear regression model of the residuals of the population-wise models against THI for milk yield and concentration of fat, protein, lactose, and specific fatty acids. Compared to reaction-norm models, individual records per cow are combined before model fitting, thereby reducing computation times and allowing more flexibility in the design of the model. Heritabilities for heat tolerance traits ranged from 0.05 to 0.12, and genetic variances indicate substantial potential for breeding as an improvement of the population by one genetic standard deviation would already offset 69% of the losses in fat percentage, 65% in protein percentage, and 11% in milk yield. Heat tolerance based on milk yield showed favorable correlations with most commercial traits, whereas heat tolerance based on fat and protein percentage showed negative correlations to health and resilience. A genome-wide association study using both SNPs and haplotype blocks from the software HaploBlocker identified potential QTLs across the genome, with particularly strong signals on BTA5, 14, and 20. These findings support the potential of breeding for heat tolerance but highlight the need for complementary management strategies to mitigate heat stress impacts.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

C.; Paulini, M.; Sotero-Caio, C. G.; Wood, J. M. D.", "abstract": "Obtaining chromosomally complete genome assemblies across the tree of life is a major goal of biodiversity genomics. However, some lineages remain recalcitrant to assembly despite recent advances in sequencing technologies and assembly tools. Birds present a substantial genome assembly challenge due to the presence of tiny, hard to assemble microchromosomes that are often highly fragmented or even missing in draft genome assemblies. As such, bird genomes require a large amount of expert manual curation effort via manipulation of genome-wide HI-C contact maps and many current chromosome-level bird genome assemblies do not resolve the known karyotype. Microchromosomes have distinct genetic and epigenetic features. They are GC-biased, gene-rich, highly methylated, and have distinct spatial organisation in the centre of the nucleus. Importantly, they are conserved across avian evolution. Here, using a reference set of expert curated bird genomes, we have identified a set of conserved microchromosome genes and developed MicroFinder, a pipeline that uses this gene set to find small microchromosome fragments in draft genome assemblies to act as anchors for manual curation of microchromosomes. We demonstrate how MicroFinder can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of bird genome curation.

Results We introduce a Sequencing Analysis Toolkits for Off-target Nomination (SANTON) for the identification and quantification of potential off-target sites using datasets generated from synthetic oligonucleotide-based sequencing and whole genome-based sequencing (e.g., Digenome-seq) methods. By applying SANTON to a Cas9 treated oligo synthesization-based sequencing data, a comprehensive set of potential off-target sites are evaluated in which the top off-target sites displayed highly constituency with a published study using in vivo method (e.g, GUIDE-seq). Utilizing SANTON to previously published Digenome-seq datasets, we identified more potential off-target regions than previous studies, including ones showing significantly higher cleavage level than the on-target site. To the best of our knowledge, SANTON is the first public package capable of analyzing synthetic oligonucleotide-based sequencing data and the first to specific optimized for the analysis of whole genome-based sequencing analysis for Cas12a and base editors.

The standard method to quantify endpoint data is to count various structural features manually, which is time-consuming and open to bias. At present, no software solutions have been developed to specifically address the analysis and quantification of VM structures. Results: To address this limitation, we developed an open source, python-based application, VaMiAnalyzer, allowing straightforward quantification of several VM structural features. The application follows a two-step approach that optionally corrects and enhances the raw input images and then analyzes and quantifies the VM features.

These arrays form liquid-like condensate droplets under a physiological salt condition of 150 mM NaCl. According to our results from bright-field microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, optical super-resolution imaging, and microrheology with optical tweezers, histone H4 tail lysine residues are the main drivers of liquid-liquid phase separation of chromatin arrays. We also found that the condensed liquid-like droplets contain both a mobile fraction and a relatively immobile structural scaffold and that histone chaperone Nap1 and histone H3 tail acetylation facilitate DNA-histone dynamics within the structural scaffold to lower the overall viscosity of the droplets.

But the current conclusions on their involvement in cancers are generally unsystematic and even contradictory on roles of one SNARE in different types of cancer. It is necessary to find universal mechanisms of participation of SNAREs in cancers possessing generalizability within appropriate range for application of targeted therapy. Methods: Our study initiated with database analysis on clinical information and bulk RNA-seq data to locate potential effective target for certain cancer type. Then experiment validations/explorations were performed on clinical human sections, cell lines and xenograft models. Lentivirus (LV) were applied for gene KD, overexpression and microRNAs sponge; Bulk RNA-seq, microRNA-seq and DIA proteomics for identification, quantification, genesets/target analysis; WB, single-IF, TSA (Tyramide signal amplification) multi-IF, IHC for proteins detection using antibodies; QPCR for artificial microRNA-sponge sequences test; Other reagents/instruments applied for corresponding purposes. Results: VAMP5 is a therapeutic target for gliomas with expression selectivity. Gliomas could be divided into 2 types according to effects after VAMP5 KD. In VAMP5-KD sensitive type, PLK1, a classical gene vital for tumor growth/survival, is universally protein-level down-regulated that mediated partly via decrease of several up-reg microRNAs like mir-1301-3p and mir-12135, causing growth inhibition. While among insensitive type that VAMP5-KD is invalid for growth inhibition, PLK1 is not altered consistently, which serves as an evaluation marker for inhibition effectiveness. NDRG4 is a prediction marker for VAMP5-KD sensitivity that sensitive gliomas express higher NDRG4 than insensitive type on RNA level. Moreover, NDRG4 overexpression converts VAMP5-KD insensitive gliomas into sensitive type and additionally cause protein-level downregulation of VCAM1 and especially TNKS which also benefit the growth inhibition and PLK1 reduction partly. Except for results above, LGALS1 correlated and colocalized with VAMP5 possessing broader consistency than other membrane proteins so indicates the immune-enhancing potential of down-reg LGALS1 via KD VAMP5. Conclusions: These discoveries elucidated the mechanism of VAMP5 KD on gliomas inhibition preliminarily.

While most cases of MIBC are diagnosed as conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC), there is growing recognition of histologic subtypes and divergent differentiation within conventional UC. This is clinically significant, as some require modification of therapy and some are associated with more aggressive behavior. Spontaneously occurring UC in dogs has been shown to exhibit histologic and molecular features that closely resemble those of human MIBC. In this study, we evaluated 31 canine UC tumor samples for histologic subtypes and divergent differentiation. Slides were reviewed by a human uropathologist and three board-certified veterinary pathologists and assessed for expression of uroplakin III and E-cadherin. All tumors were classified as high-grade UC. Fifteen cases were identified as conventional UC. Among the remainder, eight displayed glandular differentiation, four were classified as sarcomatoid UC, two showed squamous differentiation, and one case each was classified as large nested and tubular and microcystic subtypes. In summary, this study found a higher frequency of certain histologic subtypes and divergent differentiation in canine UC- particularly sarcomatoid UC and UC with glandular differentiation-compared to previous reports in both canine UC and human MIBC. Conclusion: The relatively high prevalence of the sarcomatoid UC subtype in dogs observed in this study suggests that canine UC may serve as a valuable translational model for evaluating novel therapeutic agents, particularly for this rare and aggressive variant in humans.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Recent prior research has revealed autism-related structural alterations in the habenula, a small epithalamic structure associated with motivation and emotion; however, potential alterations in functional connectivity (FC) remain unexplored. Methods: Anatomical and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were accessed for 1,584 participants (N=705 autism; mean age: 16.26 plus-or-minus sign 8.15 years) in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). To investigate habenula alterations, we conducted a whole-brain resting state FC analysis, followed by regression analyses to explore age and brain-behavior interactions. Results: Across the entire sample, extensive habenula connectivity was observed within the midbrain dopaminergic reward system. Compared to neurotypical (NT) controls, autistic participants exhibited significantly increased habenular connectivity with the right middle temporal gyrus and bilateral superior temporal gyri. From childhood to early adulthood, habenula FC increased in autistic adolescents, and inversely decreased in NTs, with the left culmen and left parahippocampus. Between groups, habenula hyperconnectivity was inversely associated with behavioral scores for social motivation, executive functioning, and daily living skills, but not social communication. Conclusions: This study provides novel evidence of habenula connectivity alterations in autism, highlighting atypical FC with the auditory cortex. Further findings suggest that habenula circuitry develops differently among autistic adolescents, with links between habenula hyperconnectivity and motivation and adaptive behaviors. Taken together, these results contribute to emerging evidence that the dopaminergic reward system may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of autism.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Participants encoded and retrieved spatial locations using either landmarks alone (landmark condition), visual self-motion cues alone (i.e., optic flow; self-motion condition), or both cues together (combination condition). Participants behaviorally benefited from cue integration. fMRI analyses revealed a cue integration effect in the hippocampus, which displayed positional coding only in the combination condition, and only in participants who showed behavioral benefits from cue integration. Furthermore, hippocampal positional coding was more strongly associated with actual than self-reported locations, indicating it integrates sensory-perceptual inputs from spatial cues.

One such mutation was identified in DCHS1, a protocadherin family gene, and it was found to disrupt an N-glycosylation site in modern humans. Using CRISPR/Cas9-editing we introduced into human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) this ancestral DCHS1 variant present in Neanderthals and other primates, representing the ancestral state before the modern human-specific substitution. Leveraging hiPSCs-derived neural organoids, we observed an expansion of striatal progenitors at the expense of the neocortex, mirroring the anatomical distribution seen in non-human primates.

In this study, using iPSCs obtained from a boy with a loss-of-function mutation in MCT8, a transporter previously identified as critical for thyroid hormone uptake and action in neural cells, we demonstrate that thyroid hormones induce transcriptional changes that promote the progression of human neural precursor cells along the dorsal projection trajectory. Consistent with these findings, single-cell, spatial, and bulk transcriptomics from MCT8-deficient cerebral organoids and cultures of human neural precursor cells underscore the necessity for optimal thyroid hormone levels for these cells to differentiate into neurons. The controlled intracellular activation of T4 signaling occurs through the transient expression of the enzyme type 2 deiodinase, which converts T4 into its active form, T3, alongside the coordinated expression of thyroid hormone nuclear receptors. The intracellular activation of T4 in NPCs results in transcriptional changes important for their division mode and cell cycle progression. Thus, T4 is essential for fetal neurogenesis, highlighting the importance of adequate treatment for mothers with hypothyroidism.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we leverage these functional genomic annotations and human polymorphism data to infer the distributions of fitness effects of new noncoding mutations in humans. Our novel approach controls for mutation rate variation and linked selection along the genome. We find distinct patterns of selection in putative enhancers, promoters, and conserved noncoding regions. While mutations in enhancers are often neutral, approximately 30% of mutations in promoters are deleterious. The most conserved noncoding regions, showing reduced divergence across mammals and primates, have the highest proportion of deleterious mutations. Notably, while we infer the most conserved sites across mammals and primates are enriched for deleterious mutations, such conserved sites only account for a minority of the deleterious mutations in noncoding regions. For example, the top 5% of conserved noncoding sites encompass fewer than 20% of deleterious mutations, indicating that functional noncoding regions vary widely in the distribution of their evolutionary constraint. Our findings highlight the dynamic evolution of gene regulation and shifting selection pressures over deep evolutionary timescales. Consistent with this finding, we infer mutations in ~7-9% of the noncoding genome are deleterious.

Bone healing and the ability to bear weight are closely tied to the mechanical stability of the fracture site. Although fracture stabilization is a well-established factor modulating the rate and extent of bone repair, there is a notable gap in non-destructive technologies that can rapidly and objectively quantify functional recovery in preclinical settings. We consider this to be a significant limiting factor in translational studies directed at improving fracture healing. Here, we describe a novel behavioral phenotyping approach that enables rapid quantification of post-fracture weightbearing and kinematic metrics in freely behaving mice. Our goal is to identify and characterize metrics most indicative of fracture-induced behavioral impairment and to use these metrics to quantify how functional recovery is altered in mice with pin stabilized versus non-stabilized fractures. We also use this approach to explore whether sex is a significant contributor to functional recovery. Methods: Male and female adult C57BL6/J received a mid-shaft tibial fracture that was either left unstabilized or fixed with an intramedullary pin. Non-fractured naive mice served as controls. Behavioral recordings of freely moving mice were acquired prior to fracture and then throughout the time course of healing, from 5 to 35 days post fracture (DPF). To track mice and analyze changes in paw pressure and kinematic behaviors after fracture, we then applied a novel machine learning-enabled behavioral phenotyping analysis. Results: In this study, we demonstrate that severity of the behavioral phenotype is more significant in mice with unstabilized fractures when compared to mice with pin-stabilized fractures. Pin stabilization generally allowed increased weightbearing and produced smaller changes in kinematic metrics. Interestingly, we observed only minor sex specific differences in fracture-induced behavioral impairments and recovery. Our analysis also revealed that functional recovery is more complex than is a set of individual parameters viewed in isolation. In fact, unique behavioral parameters identified different time windows for functional recovery. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive, unified graph theoretic metric of fracture recovery that encompasses all behavioral parameters quantified. Using this unified metric, we confirmed the increased severity of the fracture phenotype in unstabilized versus pin stabilized mice and identified a clear time window of functional recovery, for both fracture groups. Discussion: Our findings demonstrate how this novel comprehensive behavioral phenotyping approach, which combines machine learning and graph theory, makes it possible to rapidly quantify longitudinal changes in mice after fracture. This approach enables us to determine functional recovery patterns based on a unified behavioral metric of healing. Our data and methodology form a foundation for future mechanistic experiments focused on understanding biological or mechanical variables that influence functional healing and will also enable more rapid testing of various strategies to accelerate bone healing.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

The voltage setpoints and efficiency of cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 state transitions are crucial for tuning the initiation and conduction of myocardial action potentials. The channel cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) regulates gating by intramolecular interactions and by serving as a hub for the binding of accessory proteins. We have investigated the roles of the CTD in intrinsic and FGF homologous factor (FHF)-modulated Nav1.5 gating through structure-guided CTD subdomain mutagenesis. The EF-hand module within the CTD was found to exert the most profound effects on channel gating, strongly influencing voltage-dependence of inactivation and activation, accelerating inactivation from the closed state, decelerating inactivation from the open state, minimizing persistent sodium current, and serving as the binding domain for FHF proteins. Nav1.5D1788K bearing a missense mutation in the EF-hand motif displayed a depolarizing shift in voltage dependence of activation and generated greatly enhanced persistent sodium current without altering the voltage dependence of channel inactivation. Reciprocally, Nav1.5L1861A bearing a different missense mutation in the EF-hand underwent closed-state inactivation at more negative membrane potential and at an accelerated rate, but did not display other phenotypes associated with CTD deletion. Nav1.5V1776A/T1778A bearing mutations in the juxtamembrane region between the EF-hand and the channel pore helices displayed wild-type intrinsic gating properties, while FHF modulation of inactivation gating was impaired. Our channel physiology studies together with prior structural data suggest that the voltage and rate of channel inactivation from the closed state are governed by an intramolecular hydrophobic interaction of the CTD EF-hand with the cytoplasmic inactivation loop helix and the extension of this binding interface upon FHF-induced restructuring of the juxtamembrane region, while a distinct CTD intramolecular electrostatic interaction modulates voltage-dependent activation and minimizes persistent sodium current.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}

L.; Nguyen, M.; Messinger, J.; Kraft, T. W.; Pittler, S. J.; Pahlberg, J.", "abstract": "GARP2, a glutamic-acid-rich protein found exclusively in rod photoreceptors, has been suggested to function as a structural protein, a modulator of the cGMP phosphodiesterase enzyme (PDE6), and a gating inhibitor of the rod cGMP-gated cation channel. GARP2 is a splice variant of the Cngb1 gene, which in the rods encodes the {beta}-subunit of the cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel. Mutations in Cngb1 cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP45), and {beta}-subunit knockout mice are being studied as models of this disease. In this study, using ZFN-mediated gene editing, we have selectively eliminated GARP2 expression, while not affecting expression of the cyclic nucleotide gated cation channel {beta} -subunit, to determine its essential functions in mouse rods. The absence of GARP2 caused no consistent perturbations of retinal structure. Transiently, rod outer segment length was regionally greater than WT and infrequently misaligned, appearing parallel to the retinal pigment epithelium. Electroretinography of the knockout mice did reveal consistent functional alterations over time, seen as a reduction in the ERG response amplitudes in older mice, albeit with no significant alterations in sensitivity to light. Interestingly, single-cell patch-clamp recordings showed a significant reduction in rod photoreceptor dark noise consistent with a previously proposed role for GARP2 in binding to PDE6 and affecting its basal activity. Our results suggest a role for the GARP2-PDE6 interaction in stabilizing the PDE6 enzyme and controlling the turnover rate of cGMP in darkness, adjusting the level of dark noise and implicating an influence on the signal and noise properties of rod photoreceptors.", "date": "2025-05-14", "journal": ""}
