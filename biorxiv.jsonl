Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a recently identified mechanism, mitigates ribosome collisions resulting from frequent translation stalls. However, the precise pathophysiological role of the RQC pathway in oncogenesis remains ambiguous. Our research centered on the pathogenic implications of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing), a specific RQC response to translational arrest on the outer mitochondrial membrane, in glioblastoma (GBM). The presence of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins was observed commonly in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). The exogenous introduction of the mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5) protein, accompanied by artificial CAT-tail mimicking sequences, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) and inhibited the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). These alterations in mitochondrial characteristics provided resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Consequently, msiCAT-tailing can foster cell survival and migration, whereas blocking msiCAT-tailing via genetic or pharmacological intervention can impede GBM cell overgrowth.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms responsible for the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis, causing devastating morbidity and mortality in the developing world. The parasites are protected by a skin-like tegument, and maintenance of this tegument is controlled by a schistosome ortholog of the tumor suppressor TP53. To understand mechanistically how p53-1 controls tegument production, we identified a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor homolog (cki) that was co-expressed with p53-1. RNA interference of cki resulted in a hyperproliferation phenotype, that, in combination with p53-1 RNA interference yielded abundant tumor-like growths, indicating that cki and p53-1 are bona fide tumor suppressors in Schistosoma mansoni. Interestingly, cki homologs are widely present throughout parasitic flatworms but evidently absent from their free-living ancestors, suggesting this cki homolog came from an ancient horizontal gene transfer event. This in turn implies that the evolution of parasitism in flatworms may have been aided by a highly unusual means of metazoan genetic inheritance.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

However, the evidence for this relationship in other species has been equivocal. Here, we describe an experiment that measured the acquisition of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in 14 groups of rats trained with different C/T ratios (ranging from 1.5 to 300) to establish how learning is related to informativeness. We show that the number of trials required for rats to start responding to the CS is determined by the C/T ratio, and the specific scalar relationship between the rate of learning and informativeness is similar to that previously obtained with pigeons. We also found that the response rate after extended conditioning is strongly related to T, with the terminal CS response rate being a scalar function of the CS reinforcement rate (1/T). Moreover, this same scalar relationship extended to the rats' overall response rates (during the CS and inter-trial interval) which was directly proportional to the overall rate of reinforcement in the context (1/C). The findings establish that animals encode rates of reinforcement, and that conditioning is directly related to how much information the CS provides about the US. The consistency of these observations across species, captured by a simple regression function, suggests a universal model of conditioning.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

We previously found that loss of Yki in the Drosophila male accessory gland (MAG) squamous epithelium promotes squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) by upregulating TOR signaling, but the mechanism was unknown. Here, we show that this tumorigenesis stems from TOR-mediated hyperacetylation of -tubulin. This pathway is tissue-specific, as the ovarian follicular epithelium is resistant to Yki loss. A comparison of MAG and follicular epithelia single-cell transcriptomic data revealed their distinct Yki-TOR signaling states, suggesting lineage-specific mechanoconstraints in these two lineages.

C.", "abstract": "Risk attitudes -the willingness to accept greater uncertainty to achieve larger potential rewards- determine many aspects of our lives and are often interpreted as an individual trait that reflects a general 'taste' for risk. However, this perspective cannot explain why the choices that people make concerning risky outcomes can change considerably across contexts and even across repetitions of the identical decisions. Here we provide modelling and neural evidence that such rapid changes in risk attitudes emerge from Bayesian inference on noisy magnitude representations in the parietal cortex. Our participants underwent fMRI while choosing between safe and risky options that were either held in working memory or present on the screen. Risky options that were held in working memory were less likely to be chosen (risk aversion) when they had relatively large payoffs but more likely to be chosen (risk-seeking) when they had relatively small payoffs. These counterintuitive effects can be explained mechanistically by a computational model of the Bayesian inference underlying payoff perception: Options kept in working memory are noisier and therefore more prone to central tendency biases, leading small (or large) payoffs to be overestimated (or underestimated) more. Congruent with the behavioural modelling, fMRI population-receptive field modelling showed that on trials where intraparietal payoff representations were noisier, choices were also less consistent and less risk-neutral, in line with participants resorting more to their prior beliefs about potential payoffs. Our results highlight that individual risk attitudes and their puzzling changes across contexts and choice repetitions can be rooted in perceptual inference on noisy parietal magnitude representations, with profound implications for economic, psychological, and neuroscience theories of risky behaviour.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Similarly, in some bird and insect species, males offer their mates food to indicate their quality as a provider. Among non-human primates, however, the relationship between meat sharing and reproductive success is underexplored, leaving the evolutionary origins of this phenomenon unresolved. Guinea baboons (Papio papio) are a promising model to investigate whether meat sharing signals male quality, since females choose their mates, have been shown to rely on males to catch and share prey, and are responsive to male foraging skill. We combined records of 109 meat-eating events with nine years of behavioural data to test whether males who more frequently acquired and shared meat with females had more females in their social units for longer. Contrary to our predictions, we found no evidence that females preferred males who acquired or shared meat more frequently, suggesting that meat acquisition does not function as a signal of male quality in Guinea baboons. One explanation may be the relatively low frequency of meat-eating events. Another is that females are less dependent on males for meat than previously reported. Our results revealed that nearly half (41%) of female meat intake originated from sources other than her unit male, including the first documented cases of female prey capture (11% of events). Thus, females likely apply other, more pertinent, criteria in mate choice.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

SYQ and LT mutations designed to disrupt this interface result in severe period and temperature-sensitive fly phenotypes, and two LT mutations cause unprecedented free-running periods > 44 hours and temperature-sensitive changes of ~20 hours. Further characterization of a LT mutant strain shows a severe reduction in both PER phosphorylation and PER degradation. A human PER equivalent of the same LT mutation is a much less efficient in vitro substrate for CK1-mediated phosphorylation.

We find that cells exhibit a minimal response to Wnt at certain frequencies, a behavior we term anti-resonance. We developed both detailed biochemical and simplified hidden variable models that explain how anti-resonance emerges from the interplay between fast and slow pathway dynamics. Remarkably, we find that frequency directly influences cell fate decisions involved in human gastrulation; signals delivered at anti-resonant frequencies result in dramatically reduced mesoderm differentiation.

Yet, how the association between sleep and PD emerges over the healthy lifetime is not established. We examined association between the polygenic risk score (PRS) for PD and the variability in the electrophysiology of Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep in 433 younger (18-31y) and 85 late-midlife (50-69y) healthy individuals. Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study, in-lab EEG recordings of sleep were recorded to extract REM sleep metrics. PRS was computed using SBayesR approach. Results: Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) analysis showed significant association of REM duration (pcorr=0.03) and theta energy in REM (pcorr=0.004) with PRS for PD in interaction with age group. In the younger sub-sample, REM duration and theta energy were positively associated with PD PRS. In contrast, in the late-midlife sub-sample, the same associations were negative (though only qualitatively for REM theta energy) and may differ between men and women. Interpretation: REM sleep is associated with the PRS for PD in early adulthood, 2 to 5 decades prior to typical symptoms onset. The association changes from positive in younger individuals, presumably free of alpha-synuclein, to negative in late-midlife individuals, possibly because of the progressive presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates or of the repeated increased oxidative metabolism imposed by REM sleep. Our findings may unravel core associations between PD and sleep and may contribute to novel intervention targets to prevent or delay PD.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

This collateral damage can create novel dependencies specific to the co-deleted context. One notable example is the dependency on PRMT5 activity in tumors with MTAP deletion, which co-occurs with CDKN2A/B loss, leading to the development of MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors. To identify additional collateral damage context/target pairs for chromosome 9p and other common loci of chromosomal deletions, we conducted a combinatorial CRISPR screen knocking out frequently co-deleted genes in combination with a focused target library. We identified the gene encoding the ribosome rescue factor PELO as synthetic lethal with loss of gene encoding the SKI complex interacting protein FOCAD, which is frequently co-deleted alongside MTAP and CDKN2A/B on chromosome 9p. A genome-wide screen in FOCAD isogenic cells further identified the ribosome rescue GTPase and PELO binding partner HBS1L as the top synthetic lethal target for FOCAD loss. Analysis of publicly available data and genetic manipulation of HBS1L using orthogonal modalities validated this interaction. HBS1L dependency in FOCAD-deleted cells was rescued by FOCAD re-expression, and FOCAD intact cells could be rendered HBS1L-dependent by FOCAD knockout, demonstrating the context specificity of this interaction. Mechanistically, HBS1L loss led to translational arrest and activated the unfolded protein response in FOCAD-deleted cells. In vivo, HBS1L deletion eliminated growth of FOCAD-deleted tumors. Here we propose a model where the FOCAD/SKI complex and HBS1L/PELO work together to resolve aberrant mRNA-induced ribosomal stalling, making the HBS1L/PELO complex an intriguing novel target for treating FOCAD-deleted tumors.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Studies 1A/1B examined semantic- and reward-processing PE using task-fMRI, yielding converging evidence of PE's global effects on large-scale connectivity: high-PE states broadly upregulated ventral-dorsal connectivity, and low-PE states upregulated posterior-anterior connectivity. Investigating whether these global patterns characterize cognition generally, Studies 2A/2B used resting-state fMRI and showed that individuals continuously fluctuate between ventral-dorsal (high-PE) and posterior-anterior (low-PE) dynamic connectivity states. Additionally, individual differences in PE task responses track differences in resting-state fluctuations, further endorsing that these fluctuations represent PE minimization at rest.

Anatomical work in nonhuman primates suggests that these responses may be enabled by monosynaptic, corticocortical projections between auditory and visual areas. Such projections would not only provide routes for rapid modulation of visual processing in the sighted, but also avenues for cortical adaptation following vision loss. However, there is little available information on the presence and organization of such projections in humans. Here, we address this question by examining intracranial responses to direct electrical stimulation of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in 23 patients (both male and female). Mid- and posterior-STG stimulation produced rapid responses in early visual cortex (18ms+), with a distribution that favored lateral occipital cortex and anterior calcarine regions near peripheral V1. Early visual cortex (V1/V2) responded most strongly to stimulation over mid-STG, whereas lateral occipital cortex (near V5/hMT+) exhibited the most robust response to posterior STG stimulation. These data demonstrate that communication from auditory to visual cortex can occur in humans at latencies that are compatible with corticocortical, potentially monosynaptic, transmission. Responses in visual cortex were organized in a manner similar to that of nonhuman primates, with preliminary evidence for an exception over the occipital pole.

However, the extent to which these periodic forces influence organisms at both genomic and phenotypic levels remains unclear. Furthermore, despite the compelling evidence of fluctuating selection from recent studies, there is a disconnect between empirical findings and theoretical models concerning the underlying mechanisms due to the limited evidence regarding the scale and processes that generate stable genome-wide oscillations. This study aims to elucidate the genetic and ecological factors driving fluctuating selection and to identify the parameters that produce consistent oscillatory patterns in allele frequencies. To address these longstanding challenges, we developed a modeling framework integrating quantitative and population genetics to simulate a population under various selection regimes. Using SLiM, a forward evolution simulator, we varied genetic (heritability and genomic architecture) and ecological (selection pressure and season length) parameters. Unlike previous models focusing on selection acting directly on loci, our approach evaluates individual fitness based on the shift in the seasonal optimum relative to the mean phenotype. We also applied spectral analysis to detect periodicity, indicating cyclical selective environments. Our simulations shed light on conditions sustaining oscillations in allele frequencies over time. Spectral analysis successfully identifies the periodic patterns from allele frequency, even under highly complex selection regimes. Not only does our study clarify the conditions that yield persistent oscillatory behaviors, but these parameters are also relatively easy to predict from natural population, providing a possibility of empirically testing these models.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Results: Our hybrid assembly reconstructed 837 metagenome-assembled genomes, including 466 that meet high- and medium-quality standards, nearly all lacking close relatives among cultivated taxa. Rarefaction and k-mer analyses reveal that, even at this depth, we capture only a fraction of the extant diversity: non-parametric models project that more than ten trillion base pairs of sequencing data would be required to approach saturation. These findings offer a quantitative, technology-enabled update to long-standing diversity estimates and demonstrate that conventional metagenomic sequencing efforts likely miss the majority of microbial and biosynthetic potential in soil.

M.", "abstract": "Introduction: Electromyography (EMG) remains the gold standard for estimating the Resting Motor Threshold (RMT) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) studies, but its cost and limited accessibility often lead researchers to use visual inspection (VIS). However, VIS may introduce variability and systematic bias. Accelerometry (ACC) offers a cost-effective, objective alternative to capture TMS-evoked responses. Objective: To compare the RMT as estimated using EMG, ACC, and VIS. Methods: Five participants underwent TMS while EMG, ACC, and video recordings were collected. Separately, 64 observers judged hand movement in videos to estimate RMT via VIS. RMTs were compared across the three methods using Bayesian model comparison, Bland-Altman analyses, and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs). Results: RMTs estimated via EMG were lower than those obtained using either ACC or VIS. Compared to EMG, VIS tended to overestimate RMT (mean bias = 5.23%, 95%CI = [1.00-11.00]), while ACC and VIS estimates were more closely aligned (mean bias = 0.43%, 95%CI = [-4.00 - 5.00]). ICC (2,1) values indicated moderate reliability for VIS vs EMG (mean = 0.580, 95%CI = [0.389 - 0.748]), and good-to-excellent reliability for VIS vs ACC (mean = 0.845). However, bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals identified significant variability in the estimates provided by visual inspection, ranging from +1 to +11 for VIS vs EMG, but as low as -4 to +5 for VIS vs ACC. Conclusions: EMG remains the most sensitive technique for estimating the RMT, but when EMG is not feasible, accelerometery provides a quantifiable, more objective, and less variable alternative than visual inspection.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Testing whether allelic imbalance between two RIL x Tester crosses is equal, is a test of cis or trans depending on the RIL alleles compared. The study design also enables to separate two sources of trans variation, genetic and environmental, detected via interactions with cis effects. Examining these components of regulatory variation, we demonstrate this approach in a long-read RNA-seq experiment in female abdominal tissue at two time points in Drosophila melanogaster. Among the 40% of all loci that show evidence of genetic variation in cis, trans effects due to the environment are detectable in 31% of loci and trans effects due to genetic background are detectable in 19% of loci with little overlap in sources of trans variation. The loci identified in this study are associated with loci previously reported to exhibit genetic variation in gene expression in a range of tissues and large population samples, suggesting that there is consistent variation for genetic regulation of gene expression. We show that eleven loci in a QTL for thermotolerance, previously shown to differ in expression based on temperature, have evidence for regulation of gene expression regardless of the environment, including Cpr67B, a cuticular protein suggesting a potential functional role for standing variation in gene expression. This study provides a blueprint for efficiently identifying regulatory variation in gene expression, as the tester design maximizes cis variation and enables the efficient assessment of all pairs of RIL alleles relative to the tester, a much smaller study compared to the pairwise direct assessment.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

While Aloe vera is widely recognized for its therapeutic properties, the potential of its extracellular vesicles (Av-EVs) remains underexplored. Objective: This study aimed to isolate and characterize Av-EVs and evaluate their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties in vitro, focusing on the impact of extraction method and plant maturity. Methods: Av-EVs were isolated from mature and young Aloe vera leaves using manual (NB) or blender-based (B) homogenization. Vesicles were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and protein quantification. Antioxidant and cytotoxicity assays (DPPH, alamarBlue) were followed by functional anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic analyses respectively in LPS-stimulated THP-1 macrophages and TGF-{beta}1/Vitamin C-activated human dermal fibroblasts (RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, proteomics). Results: NB-derived EVs from mature leaves exhibited the most potent activity across all assays, showing superior antioxidant capacity, greater suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhanced M2 macrophage polarization, and significant downregulation of COL1A1 and a-SMA. In contrast, B-derived and young leaf-derived EVs showed reduced bioactivity, with young EVs failing to inhibit fibrotic markers.

S.", "abstract": "Photosynthetic microorganisms are responsible for primary production at the base of the marine food web that impacts ocean biogeochemistry and ecological interactions. The growth of these microorganisms is balanced by mortality processes, including top-down losses from zooplankton grazing and infection and lysis by viruses. Multiple types of grazers and viruses often coexist despite apparent competition for the same (or similar) microorganisms. Here, we develop a community model of photosynthetic microorganisms, grazers, and viruses that accounts for molar cell and virion elemental quotas suitable for incorporation into ocean ecosystem models. Our aim is to investigate mechanisms that enable coexistence of a virus and a grazer with a single phytoplankton type. To do so, we evaluate the extent to which coexistence is facilitated by: (i) infected phytoplankton, potentially subject to non-preferential intraguild predation, where grazers feed on virally infected microorganisms; (ii) heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection, where microorganisms vary in their resistance to the virus either intracellularly or extracellularly; and (iii) the inclusion of higher order mortality terms for the predators. We find evidence for a trade-off between the virus latent period and virulence in facilitating a coexistence regime. The inclusion of an explicit latent period can generate oscillations of all populations that facilitate coexistence by reducing the growth rate of the free virus, or lead to system collapse when oscillations become too large. Heterogeneity in phage susceptibility promotes coexistence through resource partitioning between the predators, while higher-order mortality terms widen the coexistence regime by stabilizing the system. We observe strong sensitivity of model outcomes to viral life history traits, including shifts in infected cell percentages and the balance between virally and zooplankton-induced mortality. Finally, taking advantage of algebraic calculation of model equilibria, we identify life history trait parameter combinations that yield realistic ecological properties in simplified oligotrophic and mesotrophic epipelagic environments. Importantly, our ecological models suggest that ongoing efforts to embed virus dynamics in large-scale ocean ecosystem models should likely include phytoplankton types that are moderately to strongly resistant to viral infection and lysis.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Using speech decoding, we show that listeners learn speaker-specific semantic priors, which sharpen sensory representations by pulling them toward expected acoustic signals.

Ovarian cancer (OC), particularly the high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) subtype, is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and limited treatment options. Among the miRNAs encoded at the often amplified 8q24.3 region, miR-6850 has emerged as a potential candidate target owing to its genomic positioning inside this hotspot and its unexpectedly low expression in HGSOC tissues and cell lines. In silico investigations indicated that, despite the gain in MIR6850 copy number, its mature products, miR-6850-5p and miR-6850-3p, were expressed at low levels; notably, MIR6850 gene amplification was associated with enhanced disease-specific survival. Functional studies revealed that ectopic production of both isoforms in SKOV-3 and NIH:OVCAR3 cells inhibited proliferation, compromised clonogenic capacity, and disturbed cell cycle progression. Moreover, miR-6850 altered cell phenotype by facilitating mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), as shown by the overexpression of E-cadherin and {beta}-catenin and the downregulation of Slug and Vimentin. It also regulated cell adhesion and migration while reducing global protein synthesis via the downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.

In mammals, the germline trajectory originates from a limited number of primordial germ cells (PGCs), persists through the lifespan of the organism, and continues across generations. Yet, the dynamics and contributions of individual PGC lineages remain enigmatic. Here, we employ Polylox1 DNA barcoding to unveil the clonal dynamics of mouse male germline from development to the next generation and find that disparate probabilities for trans-generational inheritance from individual PGCs are established in early embryogenesis and persist throughout adulthood. Indeed, >30% of PGC clones are lost before colonisation in the testis, suggesting early quality control, with surviving PGC clones expanding unevenly. Thereafter, clone sizes remain stable lifelong, and inheritance to offspring is proportional to clone size, arguing against strong variability in sperm fitness. Mathematical analysis of the barcoding data indicates that early clonal dynamics follow probabilistic rules, whereas the subsequent compartmentalisation of clones into seminiferous tubules in the testis preserves the clonal repertoire and may guard against large-scale selection of mutant clones. This study defines the quantitative dynamics of male germline development and transmission and thus reveals constraints for how de novo mutations that arise in germ cells can be transmitted to offspring.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Population history, including ancestral migration routes, population structure, demography, admixture, and founder effects, was elucidated using diverse population genetic statistics methods. Thar groups occupy an intermediate position on the Indian north south cline. Pastoralists and artisans (woodcarvers, Persian gold embosser) clustered with West Eurasian lineages, while potters and performers aligned with southern clines. Uniparental data confirmed heterogeneous Indian lineages. Signals of gene and culture was evident from the lactase persistence allele was higher in pastoralists but lower in gold-embossers despite shared ancestry.

This process is termed store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). The proteins STIM1 and STIM2 function as ER calcium sensors, and upon store depletion, they undergo a conformational change that allows them to bind to and gate Orai calcium channels on the plasma membrane. We have shown that both Orai1 and STIM1 are dynamically S-acylated after store depletion, which is required for SOCE. These results suggest the requirement of a calcium-activated protein S-acyltransferase such as DHHC21. Here, we show that DHHC21 is required for SOCE in vitro and in vivo. Using the depilated mouse model that expresses DHHC21 but can no longer be activated by calcium, we show that DHHC21 is required for STIM1 S-acylation and subsequent calcium entry. Plasma membrane-localized DHHC21 is dynamically recruited into Orai1/STIM1 puncta upon store depletion, where it physically binds to STIM1. Finally, we show that depilated mice phenocopy many aspects of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), including defective Fas-mediated calcium release, T cell death, neutropenia, and increased serum vitamin B12 levels. These results suggest that dynamic S-acylation has underappreciated and expansive roles in second messenger signaling and immune system function.

In this study, we explore the transcriptomic responses of virgin and mated flies to changes in nutritional environments. We confirm previous phenotypic findings by observing responses to dietary preferences and nutritional needs. Our results indicate that both nutritional conditions and mating status lead to significant changes in gene expression in females.

LV oscillations are driven by cortical blood-volume changes induced by neuronal activity, heartbeat and respiration. LV oscillations' amplitudes determine PET-tracer clearance from the LVs. Conclusively, induced by extra- and intracranial physiological drivers and mediated by cortical blood-volume changes, LV-volume oscillations drive macroscopic CSF flow and clearance.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

S.; Lazar, Z. I.; Santhi, N.; Lo, J. C.; Groeger, J. A.; Dijk, D.-J.", "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythms both contribute to cognitive performance, but the underlying neuronal network-level changes remain unclear. We quantified the contribution of brain state, sleep-pressure dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle, and circadian rhythmicity to electroencephalographic (EEG) functional connectivity (FC) and examined how these network changes relate to cognition. Thirty-four healthy adults completed a 10-day forced-desynchrony protocol to uncouple sleep-wake and endogenous circadian rhythms. From over 1,200 hours of artifact-free EEG, we derived phase-coupling metrics to quantify FC across brain states, thirds-of-the-night (sleep pressure), and circadian phase, and related these network measures to a range of cognitive performance indices. FC differed markedly between brain states, especially in the alpha and sigma bands, and was modulated by sleep history and circadian phase. Principal component analysis revealed both a global and a topographically distributed FC component which responded differentially to sleep pressure. Dissipation of sleep pressure was accompanied by increasing global FC in NREM sleep, and especially in the delta, sigma and beta frequencies, and decreasing global FC in the alpha band. During REM sleep, global FC decreased in nearly all frequency bands with dissipation of sleep pressure. The influence of circadian phase on FC was smaller than that of sleep pressure and varied across brain states. Lower global theta-band FC in NREM and alpha-band FC during wake predicted better alertness and working memory accuracy, an effect modulated by circadian phase. These results suggest that sleep homeostasis and circadian timing interact to stabilize functional brain connectivity in wakefulness, thereby supporting optimal cognitive function.\n\nSignificance StatementIdentifying how sleep restores neural networks degraded during wakefulness is of significance for understanding sleeps role in maintaining brain function. Here we used a protocol to isolate effects of sleep from effects of circadian rhythmicity on functional connectivity of neural networks and assessed associations with cognitive performance. We found that circadian rhythmicity but in particular the dissipation of sleep pressure had profound effects on global connectivity which were different for NREM sleep, REM sleep and wakefulness and varied across frequency bands. Connectivity measures in the theta, alpha and sleep spindle frequency ranges were associated with cognitive performance. These novel findings provide a new perspective on the nature of the sleep recovery process contributing to the waking performance capability of human brains.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanistic link between TDP-43 dysfunction and neurodegeneration is poorly understood and likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. A major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease is exposure to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we investigated the synergistic interplay between TDP-43 dysfunction and TBI in a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/ frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Methods: A model of TDP-43 dysfunction caused by a knock-in Q331K mutation in Tardbp was combined with a mild model of TBI. Control conditions included both WT mice and mice with sham surgery. Animals were evaluated for behavioral deficits at timepoints pre- and post-surgery. Additionally, post-mortem brain tissues were examined using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics together with histological and biochemical analyses. Results: Expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 in vivo caused deficits in multiple branches of the proteostasis network, including protein folding, protein synthesis, and protein turnover. Examples include mis-expression of chaperones and genes within the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway in mutant TDP-43 versus WT mice. Further, mutant TDP-43 expression correlated with reduced thermostability of proteins associated with the ribosome and the chaperonin containing TCP-1 complex. In response to TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibited significantly worse neurological outcomes relative to WT animals. Heightened neurological deficits in mutant TDP-43 mice following TBI coincided with a robust upregulation of proteostasis- and stress-related genes at the transcript level. However, this upregulation was not detected at the protein level. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 leads to deficits within the proteostasis network in vivo at baseline. Despite an upregulation of proteostasis-related genes at the transcript level in mutant TDP-43 mice after TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibit an impaired response to, and recovery from, brain trauma relative to their WT counterparts. Restoring proteostasis is expected to protect against the detrimental effects of TDP-43 dysfunction, especially under stress conditions that promote neurodegenerative disease.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

J. A. M.", "abstract": "Burst suppression (BS) is a highly stereotyped EEG pattern observed across a wide range of clinical contexts, from general anesthesia and postanoxic coma to neonatal encephalopathy. Despite its consistent appearance, BS comprises two distinct forms with markedly different implications. BS with identical bursts (IBS) is almost exclusively seen in patients with severe, irreversible encephalopathy and is consistently associated with poor neurological outcome. In contrast, heterogeneous BS (HBS) can appear in reversible conditions such as anesthesia. The mechanisms that give rise to these divergent forms remain elusive. Existing theories impose disease-specific processes on otherwise healthy networks, but such models fail to explain why BS emerges across diverse etiologies and disregard the clinically critical distinction between IBS and HBS. We combined clinical, experimental, and computational approaches to identify shared mechanisms underlying BS. We analyzed EEG recordings from patients with a severe postanoxic encephalopathy and from patients undergoing general anesthesia. These clinical observations were compared with activity recordings from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal networks and rodent cortical cultures, and simulations of biophysically grounded neuronal network models. Purely excitatory, low-complexity networks, both in vitro and in silico, spontaneously generated activity virtually indistinguishable from pathological IBS. Introducing inhibitory neurons, modular network structure, or diverse external inputs progressively increased signal complexity and produced HBS-like or continuous activity resembling physiological EEG. Our findings suggest that BS, and particularly IBS, reflects a default dynamic state of simplified excitatory networks that emerges when biological complexity is lost. Different clinical conditions may compromise distinct mechanisms--inhibition, connectivity, or afferent input--yet converge on the same underlying activity pattern. While IBS reflects near-complete loss of complexity, HBS indicates partial preservation. This unified framework explains how diverse etiologies converge on BS and highlights identical forms as signatures of severely reduced network complexity.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

We applied this approach to a library of 253,632 fragments representing 46,142 cell type-specific candidate enhancers and assessed the impact of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of six transcription factors (or TFs; ATF2, CTCF, FOXA1, LEF1, TCF7L2, and SCRT1) with diverse regulatory roles. Across knockout lines, we identified responsive enhancers that were either repressed or induced, often through motifs such as the p53 family of TFs. Enhancer-gene mapping revealed TF-specific programs, including repression of Wnt/p53 targets with ATF2 or LEF1 loss, downregulation of the FIRRE locus with CTCF loss, and compensatory upregulation of RNA polymerase II regulators following FOXA1 depletion. A deep learning model trained on enhancer sequences recapitulated core principles of enhancer grammar, including cooperative motif syntax and the influence of flanking sequence context.

Participants learned predictable (P), unpredictable (U), and no-threat (N) cues by observation and encountered the same threat cues during an expression phase. Threat expectations indicated that participants successfully learned threat contingencies, showing heightened threat expectations for predictable cues and unpredictable contexts. This converged with neural responses in the anterior insula during the expression phase. Reflecting the dynamic process of learning, the amygdala responded to predictable threat cues with a linear decrease across trials. Interestingly, we found that learning to predict threats from others pain was accompanied by enhanced neural response within the amygdala, insula and hippocampus, as compared to unpredictable conditions.

Here we show that heartbeat sound promotes structural and functional maturation of human cortical organoids with a physiological astrocyte-to-neuron ratio. Continuous stimulation with heartbeat expanded the extracellular space (ECS), visualized by super-resolution 3D STED and 2-photon shadow imaging, and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, detected by LC-MS/MS proteomics. Heartbeat sound promoted neuronal and astrocytic differentiation, synaptogenesis, and organoid maturation, as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing, synaptic marker immunohistochemistry, and high-density multielectrode electrophysiology. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated astrocyte-specific expression of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels. Using Ca2+ imaging, we confirmed that low-frequency sound stimulation, including heartbeat, activates PIEZO-mediated Ca2+ responses, which in turn upregulate astrocytic ECM synthesis. Experiments with biomimetic hydrogels demonstrated that physiological matrix stiffness attenuates PIEZO activation, suggesting a mechanoprotective mechanism. Our findings demonstrate a fundamental mechanism for inducing ECM synthesis and neural differentiation through astrocytic PIEZO activation by heartbeat sound, suggesting that interoception of the internal acoustic environment is an underappreciated driver of human brain development.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

We tested whether musical experience and musical sophistication modulate PAS induced facilitation when instrument tones are paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left primary motor cortex. Method: Sixteen musicians and thirteen non-musicians completed two sessions. Session 1 estimated an individualized inter-stimulus interval (ISI) by testing seven tone TMS delays (25 to 300 ms). Session 2 applied PAS at the optimal ISI. Corticospinal excitability was assessed by motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from right first dorsal interosseus at baseline and post-intervention. Group comparisons and a stepwise multiple regression with Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold MSI) subscales evaluated predictors of the PAS effect. Results: A stepwise multiple regression model selected Group and Active Engagement (Gold MSI Factor 1) as independent predictors (F (2,26) = 4.59, p = 0.020, adjusted R2 = 0.204), without interaction: musicians exhibited smaller facilitation than non-musicians, and higher Active Engagement predicted greater facilitation across groups. Discussion: The lack of facilitation in musicians contrasts with somatosensory PAS reports of enhanced plasticity in experts. A modality specific ceiling effect may contribute, whereby long term training optimizes auditory motor transmission, reducing headroom for facilitation. The association with Active Engagement suggests motivational/reward mechanisms potentially dopaminergic gate responsiveness to auditory motor PAS. Conclusion: Under this protocol, auditory motor PAS with instrument tones facilitated corticospinal excitability in non-musicians but not in musicians. Individual differences in Active Engagement predicted facilitation, indicating that both group membership and active musical engagement shape susceptibility to auditory motor associative plasticity.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

We uncover that pregnancy increases the activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system during both homeostatic and hedonic feeding behavior in mice. VTA dopamine neurons are ultimately required for promoting increased hedonic feeding during pregnancy as inhibition of these cells selectively reduces acute high fat diet intake in pregnant mice.

The DMS circuitry is complex as it integrates multiple inputs from the cortex, thalamus, and other subcortical structures including midbrain dopamine neurons. Though less studied, serotonin neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus also richly innervate the DMS, which expresses the majority of the 14 receptor subtypes for serotonin. In particular, slice electrophysiology shows that the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) impacts DMS physiology and plasticity, and behavioral experiments show that 5-HT1BR expression modulates impulsivity and other DMS-dependent reward-related behaviors. In these studies, our goal was to investigate the effects of 5-HT1BR on the DMS in vivo during goal-directed behavior in mice. Using a genetic 5-HT1BR loss-of-function model, we examined the calcium activity of individual medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the DMS during operant tasks of responding and waiting. We found that knockout of 5-HT1BRs resulted in a significant reduction of excitatory calcium responses and an increase in the proportion of cells with inhibitory calcium responses following receipt of a reward. This suggests that serotonin may recruit MSN activity in response to reward via actions at 5-HT1BRs. On the other hand, in a behavioral paradigm designed to test impulsivity, we found that serotonin may inhibit DMS calcium activity through 5-HT1BRs. Specifically, mice lacking 5-HT1BR expression had a larger proportion of cells showing increased calcium responses during the waiting period of the trial, compared to controls. These results point to the importance of in vivo studies to understand the functional role of DMS serotonin in reward-related behavior. Overall our results demonstrate that serotonin can modulate the DMS in a behavioral state-specific manner, potentially providing a mechanism for how serotonin effects on behavior are context-dependent.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Critical transcription factors that regulate metabolism such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and their co-activator PGC-1 have been found to play important roles in neurodegenerative diseases, but their potential roles in RP have yet not been disclosed. In this study, we used organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from the rd1 mouse model for RP to investigate the effects of PPAR, PPAR{gamma}, PPAR{beta}/{delta} agonists, as well as PGC-1 activation and inhibition. Photoreceptor death in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina was quantified using the TUNEL assay, while in situ activity assays were used to monitor effects of PPARs and PGC-1 on poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) and calpain activity. In addition, we performed immunostainings to evaluate poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) generation and activation of calpain-1 and calpain-2. We found that PPAR{beta}/{delta} agonists had limited effects, while activation of PPAR, PPAR{gamma}, and PGC-1 significantly reduced photoreceptor death and PARP activity in rd1 retina. Conversely, inhibition of PGC-1 had a strong detrimental effect on photoreceptor viability. Activation of the histone deacetylase sirtuin-1, an upstream agonist of PGC-1, had no effect unless it was combined with simultaneous inhibition of PARP. Furthermore, PPAR{gamma} and PGC-1 effectively suppressed overall calpain activity and overactivation of calpain-2, alleviating photoreceptor degeneration caused by Ca2+ imbalance. In summary, our data supports the concept of a PARP-sirtuin-1-PGC-1-PPAR-PARP feedback control that connects defective energy metabolism to photoreceptor degeneration.

Proposed strategies include some without living primate parallels, including sloth-like suspensory arboreality in palaeopropithecids, although the degree of suspensory behaviour in palaeopropithecids, or locomotor diversity in koala-lemurs are poorly understood. Differently from external morphology, internal bone structure in these taxa is largely unexplored. We compared the humeral and femoral trabecular architecture of sloth- and koala-lemurs to several extant mammals, studying spherical trabecular samples extracted from high-resolution scans. After defining locomotor categories from quantitative data, we tested links between trabecular parameters and locomotor modes through exploratory and multivariate analyses, accounting for body size and phylogeny. In extant mammals, only femoral trabecular traits - particularly Degree of Anisotropy and Bone Volume Fraction - were significantly associated with locomotion, distinguishing suspensory and bridging arboreal taxa from others. Using this model, we inferred suspensory adaptations in palaeopropithecids, especially Palaeopropithecus - confirming earlier reconstructions - but also in Megaladapis edwarsi, a striking result that would make M. edwarsi the largest mammal ever known to adopt such habits, approached only by extant orangutans.

B.; Sreepadmanabh, M.; Srivastava, V.; Puzhakkal, A.; Bhattacharjee, T.; Redkar, A.", "abstract": "Plant rhizospheric interactions represent intricate relationships that determine plant fitness and are crucial for interrogating host-pathogen dynamics, with significant fundamental and translational implications. Most fungal-plant interactions occur in soil, a disordered and granular 3D environment and hence remain challenging to unravel due to complex regulatory networks. Our current body of evidence characterizing these molecular dialogues largely stems from experimental systems employing soil or in vitro 2D flat plates, hydroponics and gnotobiotic systems. Soil itself features widely varying visco-elasto-plastic material properties, and its inherent opacity precludes direct visualization of the infection progression in complex diseases such as wilts and root rots. Here, we introduce the first such optically transparent, 3D granular growth matrix to recapitulate complex properties of the soil microenvironment, which enables direct, cellular-level visualization of the plant-fungal interface. Our mechanically tunable 3D matrices support long-term co-culture of plants and fungi with compatibility to classical molecular and physiological assays for unravelling the early signalling events and inter-kingdom crosstalk. By leveraging the optical transparency of this matrix, we track fungal development in response to host signals ex-planta with 3D resolution, to report pioneering evidence of hyphal reprogramming preferentially towards the root tips during the early stages of infection. Crucially, we integrate spatiotemporal transcriptomic analyses and discover distinct pathogen-host ex- and in-planta modules during early signalling, which are likely associated with biomimetic soil-like environments. Together, our findings establish an integrable and versatile 3D platform offering an unprecedented view of the pathogen infection processes, which enables fundamental discoveries into the biological regulation of growth and infection. These insights hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of host immune responses and adaptation of filamentous pathogens, as well as open avenues to decipher drought and disease-resistance mechanisms with major agricultural benefits.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Given the diverse nature of our student cohorts, and the complex interplay of factors that determine success, it is not surprising that such variation exists in the literature. Therefore, rather than try to evaluate the impact of lecture capture, I wanted to determine whether use of lecture captures could be a marker for predicting student success in a second year undergraduate biomedical cohort. Total and unique lecture capture views, along with virtual learning environment (VLE) hours (a known engagement marker) were mapped across the academic year and compared to performance in assessments. The study identified that student engagement with lecture capture (total views and unique views) and VLE hours were positively correlated with exam attainment for all time points across the academic year. Students with higher grades were more likely to have higher total and unique views, while those with the lowest grades were less likely to have watched lecture captures and more likely to have binge watched captures just before the exam. However, it was also clear that some students did well even with low lecture capture views. Interestingly, when views were normalised to individual totals, it was clear that students who completed the majority of their own individual views in the teaching period (irrespective of total number) were more likely to do well in assessments. The study provides evidence that engagement with lecture capture and the VLE during teaching weeks can be a predictor of student success and aligns with the guidance given to undergraduate students around spacing their engagement with teaching resources.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Public and political discussions have revealed recurring opinions that reflect broader social perspectives. While scientific research on Bti progresses, knowledge of public understanding and perspectives, which are important for decision-making, remains limited. The main objective of this research was to identify and compare the social perspectives of Quebec citizens, primarily in the city of Gatineau, regarding the use of Bti for mosquito and black fly control in aquatic environments. We used Q methodology, a mixed approach combining both quantitative and qualitative methods to identify social perspectives related to the use of Bti. Our analysis revealed three social perspectives, which account for 51% of the explained variance. They reflect the broader range of opinion within citizens, and are described as \"The critical environmentalist\", \"The diligent mosquito hunter\", and \"The Bti enthusiast\". Each accounting for 29%, 12% and 10% of the explained variance, respectively. The common thread across all three perspectives is the minimal public awareness and understanding of Bti and its environmental implications.

Participatory approaches offer a way to integrate diverse stakeholder perspectives under these constraints, generating contextually relevant strategies that can indicate whether current directions are appropriate or whether priorities have been overlooked. Methods: A structured participatory workshop was conducted at the 10th Grampian Research Conference (June 2025). One hundred seventy-eight participants including National Health Service (NHS) staff, academics, industry partners, patients, and public contributors, engaged in 14 parallel roundtable discussions. Contributions were captured using posters and Post-it notes, collecting 148 written annotations. Data were analysed using thematic and content analysis, supplemented by strategic frameworks including Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT/TOWS), and Easy Wins, to identify and prioritise actionable strategies. Results: Five core themes emerged: (1) access to healthcare and services, (2) patient and public involvement and engagement, (3) digital health and service delivery innovation, (4) data access, integration, and governance, and (5) workforce development and culture. SWOT analysis identified strengths in telemedicine, interdisciplinary student training, and patient and public involvement, alongside weaknesses in fragmented data, referral tracking, and workforce pressures. TOWS matrix produced strategy-oriented recommendations such as AI-enabled scheduling, remote monitoring, and transparent referral systems. Easy Wins framework assessment highlighted immediate, low-cost improvements including identifiable NHS caller identification, automated text message reminders, updated informational videos and multilingual materials. Conclusion: By combining participatory outputs with structured strategy tools, this approach demonstrated a resource-efficient model for adaptive planning. The findings align with and extend current national health policy frameworks, offering a replicable approach for institutions aiming to obtain meaningful stakeholder engagement despite fiscal and temporal constraints.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

A related process, working memory (WM), supports long-term EM and is often also impaired. Functional connectivity (FC) between the hippocampus and caudate nucleus supports EM performance. However, this connectivity's specific influences on WM performance in MS is relatively unknown. Resting-state FC (RSFC) possesses clinical utility, including predicting cognitive impairments before they are captured by assessment. The present study tested whether RSFC with the hippocampus and caudate could predict WM performance in people with MS and in healthy individuals (HC). In a secondary analysis of 78 participants (42 MS, 36 HC), RSFC between the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and other regions was quantified. These connections' predictive influence on WM performance was then examined using a global WM performance measure for a subset with available neuropsychological data (26 MS, 15 HC). Across the entire sample (N=78), MS participants displayed stronger coupling between the right hippocampus and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, compared to HC participants. Within MS participants, stronger coupling between the left hippocampus (LHipp) and left ventral anterior cingulate (LvACC), and between the left caudate (LCaud) and right insula, were observed. Stronger decoupling between the LHipp and left supramarginal gyrus (LSMG) also emerged. Stronger LHipp-LvACC connectivity predicted worse WM performance, whereas stronger LHipp-LSMG connectivity and LCaud-RInsula connectivity each predicted better performance. The hippocampal connections were also inversely correlated. Findings identify a caudate circuit and potential hippocampal network whose aberrant, intrinsic activity could serve as neural markers for WM dysfunction in MS.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Participants first segmented their Out-of-Body Experience (OBE) and NDE into distinct experiential sequences by assigning chronological numbers to each phase. This sequencing enabled the identification and isolation of the core NDE component across participants. The graphic reconstructions represent each perceived space, Self-Location (S-L), the perceived spatial position where one experiences oneself to be located and Self-Motion (S-M), the perceived spatial trajectories and directionalities of oneself within these visuo-spatial configurations. This dual-method design was intended to capture experiential features of OBEs and NDEs that may not be conveyed through verbal reports alone. Notably, OBEs have rarely been examined regarding their independence from or conjunction with NDEs, nor their placement within the overall temporal sequence.

Here, we employed the silkworm (Bombyx mori) infection model, which is suitable for high-throughput screening, together with an Escherichia coli library containing plasmid clones of all genes from strain W3110, to identify genes whose overexpression enhances virulence. We found that overexpression of the uncharacterized protein YaiX promoted bacterial proliferation in silkworms and increased host lethality. Compared with the empty-vector control, the YaiX-overexpressing strain exhibited resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents with diverse mechanisms of action, including {beta}-lactams, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, cationic surfactants, and hydrogen peroxide. Sequence analysis revealed that amino acids 18-52 of YaiX contain a transferase hexapeptide domain predicted to form a left-handed parallel {beta}-helix. Overexpression of YaiX mutants lacking regions outside this domain conferred ampicillin resistance, whereas deletion of the hexapeptide domain abolished this phenotype. RNA sequencing and GO enrichment analyses further indicated that YaiX overexpression altered the expression of genes encoding RNA-binding proteins and porins. These findings suggest that YaiX overexpression, through its hexapeptide domain, modulates gene expression and contributes to both multidrug resistance and enhanced virulence in E. coli.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Here we track trends in biodiversity measurement, using a dataset of >2400 papers across the last 22 years, identifying trends, biases, and gaps in the assessment of nine major taxonomic groups (Invertebrate, fish, aquatic mammal, terrestrial mammal, bird, herpetofauna, fungi, microbe and plant).

Although single-phase hydrogel-based mitochondria transplantation therapy (MTT) holds promise for restoring cellular energy metabolism, its effectiveness is limited by extracellular calcium-induced mitochondrial degradation. In this study, we design a thermo-sensitive hydrogel utilizing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), composed of gelatin and polyethylene glycol (PEG), to condense freshly isolated mitochondria. Compared to conventional single-phase hydrogels, the LLPS hydrogel significantly increases the sol-gel transition temperature above physiological levels, allowing it to remain injectable at body temperature while enabling rapid mitochondrial release following transplantation. More importantly, the LLPS structure enhances mitochondrial packing density and protects the activity of condensed mitochondria against calcium toxicity through spatial confinement and gelatin-mediated calcium chelation. In vitro, LLPS hydrogel-condensed mitochondria exhibit improved mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production ability compared to those delivered via single-phase gelatin hydrogel. In vivo, mitochondria released from the LLPS hydrogel are effectively internalized by cardiomyocytes, resulting in improved cardiac function and reduced tissue damage after MIRI.

While accumulating evidence implicates DNA damage and epigenetic alterations in the pathogenesis of AD, their precise mechanistic role remains unclear. To address this, we developed a novel mouse model, DICE (Dementia from Inducible Changes to the Epigenome), by crossing the APP/PSEN1 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model with the ICE (Inducible Changes to the Epigenome) model, which allows for the controlled induction of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) to stimulate aging-related epigenetic drift. We hypothesized that DNA damage induced epigenetic alterations could influence the onset and progression of AD pathology. After experiencing DNA damage for four weeks, DICE mice, together with control, ICE, and APP/PS1 mice, were allowed to recover for six weeks before undergoing a battery of behavioral assessments including the open-field test, light/dark preference test, elevated plus maze, Y-maze, Barnes maze, social interaction, acoustic startle, and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI).

However, the mechanism underlying CLK1 localization to nSBs in response to stress removal has remained unclear. Here, we identify phosphorylation of CLK1 at Ser341 as a critical determinant of its nSB localization. Ser341 is phosphorylated under normal conditions, dephosphorylated by PP1 during stress, and rephosphorylated by RIOK2 during recovery, enabling CLK1 localization to nSBs specifically during recovery. We further identify PPP1R2, an entirely intrinsically disordered PP1 inhibitory subunit, as a reversible thermosensor that dissociates under stress to activate PP1.

Genomic analysis of clinical tumor samples confirmed the co-occurrence and proximity between APOBEC3-induced mutational footprints, microhomology-mediated deletions (MMDs), and TMEJ-associated chromosomal instability signatures.

Collectively, our findings identify TMEJ as the preferred mechanism for repairing APOBEC3A-induced DSBs and establish polymerase theta inhibition as a novel, promising strategy to eliminate cancer cells with APOBEC3A activity.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), as key driver of immunothrombosis in various thromboinflammatory diseases, may represent a critical yet uncharacterized component in the pathogenesis of PA-HSOS. Rats and mice were separately administered monocrotaline (MCT) or senecionine (SEN) via gavage to induce HSOS. Human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cell (HHSEC) and primary human neutrophil treated with MCT, SEN, or corresponding metabolites were used as in vitro models. In separate experiments, animals received a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor or neutrophil-depleting antibody to evaluate the contribution of NETs. We detected NETs within the sinusoids of necrotic liver lobes, as evidenced by robust immunostaining for NETs markers, accompanied with elevated level of circulating cell-free DNA, and hepatic citrullinated histone H3. Sinusoidal microthrombi containing VWF, CD41, and fibrin(ogen) were also stained positive for neutrophils in PA-HSOS models. Treatment with NE inhibitor or neutrophil depletion markedly attenuated PA-induced liver injury by concomitantly suppressing NETs formation and intrahepatic thrombogenesis. In vitro, conditioned medium from HHSEC exposed to MCT or SEN metabolites potently induced NETs formation. HHSEC injured by PA metabolites released CXCL8. Furthermore, hepatic mRNA and protein levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2 (murine homologous to human CXCL8) were up-regulated in PA-HSOS models, accompanied by a parallel elevation of their high-affinity receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2. Our study identifies NETs-mediated immunothrombosis as a key driver in HSOS, which provides a promising target for PA-HSOS treatment.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

However, physiology is subject to biological rhythms, including the circadian rhythm and the sleep-wake cycle. These predictable rhythms affect disease symptomatology, biomarkers used in closed-loop therapies, and a physiological system's expected response to stimulation. Therefore, therapeutic devices should incorporate feedforward elements to align algorithm parameters with predictable changes in physiological state, as a parallel of physiological rheostatic control. Here we introduce the DyNeuMo-2c, the first clinical-grade implant capable of delivering closed-loop neurostimulation while flexibly changing its functional configuration according to time of day. The device can chronically measure brain activity and motion state to track potential biomarker patterns in natural, out-of-clinic settings, allowing identification and targeting of patient-specific chronotypes. The system implements a hierarchical control flow, with baseline therapy set by a circadian scheduler, and adaptive policies layered to take effect based on specific biomarkers indicating patient and disease state. Using a benchtop validation setup, we demonstrate that the system has the required capabilities for delivering time-contingent closed-loop therapy in two established clinical use cases: Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Next, we deploy the system in vivo to deliver closed-loop deep brain stimulation in a healthy non-human primate model of vigilance, highlighting the importance of synchronisation between device operation and physiological state in various conditions (task performance, unconstrained behaviour, and sleep). Time-of-day-dependent adaptation of closed-loop stimulation enabled modulation of both vigilance and behaviour. Overall, the novel device architecture provides a proof-of-concept for delivering time-contingent therapy in chronic therapeutic settings where biological rhythms are of key importance.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Methods: Twelve healthy young women participated in a four-condition crossover protocol comprising (1) follicular phase non-exercise, (2) follicular phase exercise, (3) luteal phase non-exercise, and (4) luteal phase exercise. The exercise condition consisted of 30 minutes of resistance training at 70% of one-repetition maximum performed during the day. During each night, electroencephalography, body temperature, and core body temperature were measured in the home environment. The distal-proximal body temperature gradient (DPG), which is a validated indicator of heat dissipation, was calculated. Results: Resistance training enhanced heat dissipation, as reflected by increased DPG values, and increased the proportion of stage N3 sleep during both menstrual cycle phases, with more pronounced effects during the luteal phase. Sleep from bedtime to wake time was divided into four equal segments. Under the luteal phase with exercise, the appearance of stage N3, {delta} power, and the DPG were elevated in the mid-to-late segments of sleep. Conclusions: These findings suggest that daytime resistance training promotes nocturnal deep sleep and facilitates thermoregulatory heat loss, as indicated by an increased DPG, particularly during the luteal phase when thermoregulation is less stable than the follicular phase. This training may represent a practical intervention to improve sleep quality and physiological recovery in women across different phases of the menstrual cycle.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Theory predicts that adaptive divergence under high connectivity is favored when beneficial alleles cluster in regions of reduced recombination, a pattern that can be reinforced by structural variants (SVs). We investigated this in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from the St. Lawrence Estuary, where distinct freshwater and marine ecotypes meet and interbreed along a short ecological gradient. Using long- and short-read whole-genome sequencing, we mapped fine-scale recombination landscapes, catalogued SVs, and examined their relationship with adaptive genomic regions. Recombination landscapes differed between populations, with population-specific shifts in recombination rate estimated by an LD-based method. Putatively adaptive regions were not confined to low-recombination regions, yet SVs (inversions, insertions, and deletions) frequently coincided with local recombination suppression and elevated differentiation, suggesting they may contribute to local adaptation. Differentiated regions also overlapped disproportionately with previously-identified regions involved in repeated local adaptation across the species range, which tended to be strongly enriched on chromosomes IV, VII and XXI. These repeated regions were associated with lower recombination rates, suggesting that recombination suppression may contribute to their reuse across populations. As found in stickleback populations from other regions, the St. Lawrence populations exhibit elements suggestive of concentrated architectures clustered in a few genomic regions, along with relatively diffuse patterns of highly differentiated regions distributed genome-wide, across a wide range of recombination rates. These results highlight the intertwined roles of recombination variation and structural variation in shaping evolutionary trajectories in connected populations.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

However, BMSC colonies have very heterogeneous in vivo behaviour, due to their different potency; this unpredictability is the greatest hurdle to the development of skeletal regeneration therapies. Colony-level heterogeneity urges a fundamental question: how is it possible that one colony as a collective unit behaves differently from another one? If cell-to-cell variability were just an uncorrelated random process, a million cells in a transplant-bound colony would be enough to yield statistical homogeneity, hence washing out any colony-level traits. A possible answer is that the differences between two originating cells are transmitted to their progenies and collectively persist through an hereditary mechanism. But non-genetic inheritance remains an elusive notion, both at the experimental and at the theoretical level. Here, we prove that heterogeneity in the lineage topology of BMSC clonal colonies is determined by heritable traits that regulate cell-cycle exit. The cornerstone of this result is the definition of a novel entropy of the colony, which measures the hereditary ramifications in the distribution of inactive cells across different branches of the proliferation tree. We measure the entropy in 32 clonal colonies, obtained from single-cell lineage tracing experiments, and show that in the greatest majority of clones this entropy is decisively smaller than that of the corresponding non-hereditary lineage. This result indicates that hereditary epigenetic factors play a major role in determining cycle exit of bone marrow stromal cells.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

We have dissected ssDNA gap dynamics following nucleoside analogue-mediated nascent strand termination and report a novel mechanism, in which loss of the MRE11 negative regulator MRN-Interacting Protein (MRNIP) leads to MRE11 exonuclease-dependent suppression of post-replicative ssDNA gaps. This mechanism is driven by UBC13 and the B-family TLS polymerase REV3L, suggesting that dysregulated MRE11 activity at termination sites licenses gap filling via template switch. In the absence of PRIMPOL-dependent repriming, MRNIP loss leads to paradoxical SMARCAL1, MRE11 and primosome-dependent ssDNA gaps, suggesting that in the context of chain termination nucleolytic digestion of reversed forks generates DNA intermediates that enable primase redundancy. Our data also highlights site-specific roles for the anti-resection factor 53BP1 in the suppression of EXO1-mediated digestion at reversed forks and post-replicative ssDNA gaps.

Fish were fed diets where a predominately white fishmeal based control diet was compared to diets where full fat soyabean meal (FFS) as well as maize gluten meal (MGM) were incorporated respectively at significant levels (up to 75% of the fishmeal). Ten essential amino acids (EAAs) supplemented these diets in both standard and coated forms to evaluate their potential to rebalance the dietary EAA profiles more precisely. All diets were adjusted to be isonitrogenous and isolipidic. In addition to the growth trial, a low purified protein diet was fed to the fish separately (at a mean weight of 200g) to collect faeces for determining endogenous protein loss as well as the individual experimental diets described. As such it was possible to calculate the true digestibility for essential amino acids. The results indicated that corrective amino acid fortification of high plant diets, especially MGM could significantly (P<0.05) improve trout performance and raise their nutritional value. This was confirmed by final body weight, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio and protein utilisation values. The true digestibility of the EAAs were similar and the values of each digestible EAA but coated EAAs were slightly superior in their digestibility coefficients. Coated EAAs improved digestibility coefficients by 2 to 5% and FCR by 8% compared to crystalline forms and also improved their utilisation leading to better trout performance with respect to growth, feed conversion efficiency and Nitrogen (crude protein) retention (P<0.05).

Consequently, the ecological diversity of many ecosystems has diminished, and the abundance of bird species has declined. This study employs a novel strategy in a seasonal freshwater artificial wetland in south-east Iberia establishing species-specific index trends for common passerine birds by comparing them with climate and habitat fragmentation data. A climatic overview indicates minimal trends towards warmer and wetter conditions in terms of temperature and rainfall over the 15-year study period. This pattern persisted over a 30-year period, resulting in the formation of a Mediterranean climatic sub regional scenario with warm, dry conditions that may influence the passerine assemblage in an analogous manner to that observed in other Mediterranean assemblages. One notable feature is that this assemblage in the 1990s was characterized by low natural diversity and specialization when it was a highly disturbed wetland. However, it became natural by the mid-2000s, with diversity values like those observed in other central Mediterranean wetlands. Trends used to evaluate species-specific patterns revealed that 98% of species had an unknown trend status during the study period, with a trend slope ranging from 0 to 15%, which was not substantially different than zero, probably due to the unequal standardization methodology and the short time studied. Further research using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) revealed that precipitation and habitat alteration had the most detrimental effect on species. Of the ringed species, 60% were affected by both factors, the majority of which were Palearctic (20%). The reduction of wintering areas and shifting migration routes may account for these effects.

Transcription factors, which orchestrate oncogenic gene expression programs, are particularly challenging: they turn over rapidly, evade durable pharmacological inhibition, and resist even emerging targeted protein degradation strategies. Here, we describe a new induced-proximity therapeutic modality, Transcriptional Regulation via Active Control of Epigenetic Reprogramming (TRACER), that enforces locus-specific transcriptional silencing by recruiting endogenous corepressor complexes to transcription factor binding sites. We developed small-molecule TRACERs that tether methyl CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) and the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex to transcription factor directed ligands. An estrogen receptor (ER) TRACER potently suppressed ER transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells, downregulated canonical ER target genes, and required MBD2 and histone deacetylase (HDAC1/2) for activity, confirming on-target epigenetic repression. Extending this approach to prostate cancer, an androgen receptor (AR) TRACER transcriptionally repressed both full-length AR and the drug-resistant truncation variant AR-V7, achieving >90% inhibition of AR transcriptional activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells with locus-specific gene repression. We further show that TRACERs can be modularly reprogrammed to recruit alternative repressors, including PRC2.

Yet, existing preclinical models fail to reproduce the human brain-vascular interface, limiting studies of tumor-host crosstalk and invasion. To overcome this gap, we developed a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortico-endothelial (CO+EO) assembloid model by fusing cortical and endothelial organoids from the same genetic background. These assembloids spontaneously form branched vascular networks enriched in tight junction proteins (CLDN5, OCLN, ZO-1), thereby recapitulating a key blood-brain barrier (BBB)-like property and providing a physiologically relevant human platform for exploring glioblastoma-neurovascular interactions. Using this system, we uncover a previously unrecognized CELF2-dependent glioblastoma stem cell (GSC) tropism. CELF2-expressing GSCs preferentially infiltrate neural regions, where they trigger neuronal apoptosis and disrupt endothelial tight junction integrity, supporting an aggressive phenotype. Conversely, CELF2-deficient GSCs lose neurotropism, acquire mesenchymal features, and are redirected toward vascular compartments. This endothelial affinity requires the scaffold protein AHNAK, strongly expressed at the plasma membrane of CELF2-deficient cells and enriched at tumor-endothelial interfaces. AHNAK knockdown abolished endothelial infiltration, demonstrating its critical role in vascular tropism. Analysis of patient GB samples confirmed that CELF2-positive tumor cells are enriched in poorly vascularized, mitotically active areas and excluded from vessel-rich zones, closely paralleling assembloid findings. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that CELF2 promotes a neuronal progenitor-like program while repressing mesenchymal and vascular-associated gene expression, thereby shaping tumor identity, invasive behavior, and tissue preference. Collectively, our study introduces CO+EO assembloids as an original human model of glioblastoma plasticity at the neurovascular interface.

A steady-state fluxomic model was constructed by integrating four independent measures - oxygen consumption and proton production (Seahorse XFp), lactate and ammonia release (microfluorimetry) - into stoichiometric equations of metabolism (SAAM II software). Results. Fluxes revealed that macrophages rely on glucose to sustain glycolysis, contributing ~30% of citrate synthase flux, and predominantly on lipids for net citrate synthesis (first step of Krebs cycle). Upon polarization, M(LPS+INF-{gamma}) macrophages showed increased anaerobic glycolysis versus M0 and M(IL-4), with similar TCA fluxes to M0. In contrast, M(IL-4) macrophages exhibited higher TCA and malic enzyme fluxes, especially with glucose and glycyl-glutamine, and a trend toward enhanced lipid oxidation. Conclusions. This novel method enables precise quantification of bioenergetic fluxes. In human M{Phi}, it reveals that M(LPS+INF-{gamma}) and M(IL-4) subsets exhibit distinct metabolic phenotypes, consistent with their immunological roles. These results resolve transcriptomic-metabolic discrepancies and provide a robust framework for assessing immunometabolism in primary human cells.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

F.; Christian, S. G.; Dindot, S. V.", "abstract": "There is a growing need for alternative animal models to test brain-targeted therapies, and pigs are emerging as a promising option. Their utility, however, depends on reliable estimations of central nervous system (CNS) tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes, which are essential for translating therapeutic doses between studies in animals and humans. To address this need, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 12 commercial pigs (Sus scrofa) across four age groups (2, 5, 11, and 19 weeks). High-resolution magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord were acquired using T2-weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation and short tau inversion recovery scans. CNS tissue and CSF volumes were segmented and quantified using 3D Slicer, along with additional anatomical measurements. Our findings reveal notable age-related changes, including spinal CSF volume surpassing brain CSF volume in older pigs, highlighting shifts in CSF distribution that may influence dosing and delivery strategies for CNS-targeted therapies. This study provides a reference for future research using pig models in CNS disease studies and underscores the importance of incorporating brain and spinal CSF and CNS volume data into preclinical models.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

In area CA1 of the hippocampus, the amount of drift in the tuning of place cells on a familiar linear track is proportional to the time the animal spends exploring that track while the drift in cells' mean rate depends on the absolute time elapsed between sessions. Recently it was shown that exploration of a novel, enriched environment between sessions on the familiar track actually decreases the drift in tuning on that track, i.e. it stabilizes place fields compared to a baseline condition without the novel learning. This finding challenges computational models of drift in which new learning leads to overwriting and hence one would expect more drift, not less. Here we show that such models are indeed compatible with the observed findings as long as spatially-tuned input populations to CA1 which are active on the track versus the enriched environment are largely non-overlapping. Furthermore, in order to reproduce the findings, we must assume that the total amount of learning between the baseline and novel-exposure conditions is the same. Namely, the synaptic resources available for encoding patterns, or episodes, is fixed over a given period of time, but can be preferentially allocated to episodes of particular salience, such as the exploration of novel environments.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

T.; Grova, C.", "abstract": "The breakdown of cognitive control following sleep deprivation is widely recognised, but the physiological mechanisms and brain signatures that produce this vulnerability have not been resolved. Effective cognition relies on large-scale brain networks flexibly reconfiguring between states of integration and segregation. Here we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocardiography (ECG) collected during cognitive tasks under rested wakefulness, after sleep deprivation, and following a recovery nap to test the hypothesis that sleep deprivation constrains this dynamical repertoire and disrupts its physiological regulation. Using time-resolved functional connectivity and graph theory, we show that sleep deprivation increases the distribution of connections across networks, while reducing the temporal variability of between-network connectivity. Furthermore, dynamic fluctuations between integrated and segregated modes of network topology were dampened, with brain regions spending more time in intermediate configurations and showing greater instability of mode transitions. These alterations were tightly linked to behavioural impairment: participants who exhibited greater contraction toward intermediate topologies also showed poorer task accuracy and slower responses. Under well-rested conditions, thalamic activity peaked prior to transitions into integrated states and was suppressed during transitions into segregated states, consistent with a coordinating role in cortical dynamics. Sleep deprivation weakened and delayed this thalamic coupling. Finally, global and regional fMRI fluctuations were elevated after sleep loss, becoming decoupled from cardiac physiology while more strongly coupled to EEG delta power, further linking reduced arousal to constrained network flexibility. Together, these findings show that sleep deprivation narrows the brain's dynamical repertoire, due to disrupted thalamic regulation and changes to the physiological integration with cortical networks.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Rhizaria is a widespread and highly abundant supergroup comprising important parasites and a huge diversity of free-living heterotrophic predators. Despite the diversity and biogeochemical importance of Rhizaria, our understanding of their physiology and metabolic capabilities remains limited, mainly due to a general lack of data and bioinformatic tools for cross-species comparisons of physiological traits. In this study, we assembled a total of 15 transcriptomes of the parasite-related bacterivorous Rhogostoma and their eukaryvorous relatives. By phylogenomic analyses and whole transcriptome comparison, we established an evolutionary framework to which we relate physiological traits. The morphologically highly similar Rhogostoma strains branch in two distinct clusters differing in orthogroups and gene expression patterns related to cell adhesion and biofilm formation. Furthermore, we reveal considerable intra-genus variation in amino acid and lipid metabolism, which might be explained by an ancient streamlining through gradual specialization to parasitism, bearing the potential for subsequent metabolic radiation. We conclude that even closely related and morphologically similar species in Rhizaria may differ distinctly in their functional repertoire.

In budding yeast, the G1/S transition exerts strong size control in daughter cells, which manifests as the inverse correlation between how big a cell is when it is born and how much it grows in G1. However, mutations affecting this size control checkpoint only modestly influence population-wide size variability, often altering the coefficient of variation (CV) only by ~10%. To resolve this paradox, we combine computational modeling and live-cell imaging to identify the principal determinants of cell size variability. Using an experimentally validated stochastic model of the yeast cell cycle, we perform parameter sensitivity analysis and find that division asymmetry between mothers and daughters is the dominant driver of CV, outweighing the effects of G1/S size control. Experimental measurements across genetic perturbations and growth conditions confirm a strong correlation between mother-daughter size asymmetry and population CV. These findings reconcile previous observations and show how asymmetric division operates in concert with G1/S size control to govern cell size heterogeneity.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

The light-dependent activity of these chromoplast components influence the subsequent abundance of phytohormones that, in turn, regulate the use of energetic lipids that promote development and survival. Offspring that benefit from these chromoplast components are predicted to disperse further, over larger geographic areas, and use a wider range of currents, including those that cross ocean basins. Data presented here challenge the long-held assumption that components of non-metazoan organelles are unable to enter the germline and be passed between generations.

In this study, we delineated distinct lipidomic profiles of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), mesoderm (MES), cardiac progenitors (CPCs), immature cardiomyocytes (CMs), and mature CMs derived from ESCs using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Notably, ceramide concentrations peaked at the CPC stage, suggesting a pivotal role in mediating the MES-to-CPCs transition. Concurrently, lipid metabolites including GM3, phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were significantly upregulated in mature CMs. Integrative transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses further refined the landscape of lipid remodeling during CM differentiation. Functional assays demonstrated that LPA enhances the stability of the beating rhythm in CPCs, while both PC and LPA facilitate CM maturation.

In this paper, we first show that fitting models using this objective implicitly incorporates nucleotide-level mutation processes as part of the protein language model, which degrades performance when predicting effects of mutations on functional properties of antibodies. To address this limitation, we devise a new framework: a Deep Amino acid Selection Model (DASM) that learns the selection effects of amino-acid mutations while explicitly factoring out the nucleotide-level mutation process. By fitting selection as a separate term from the mutation process, the DASM exclusively quantifies functional effects: effects that change some aspect of the function of the antibody. This factorization leads to substantially improved performance on standard functional benchmarks. Moreover, our model is an order of magnitude smaller and multiple orders of magnitude faster to evaluate than existing approaches, as well as being readily interpretable.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that a computational method designed for multi-omic analysis in eukaryotes can be leveraged to integrate and analyse five layers of holo-omic data from porcine hosts and their gut microbiomes. We collected caecal tissue and digesta samples during a feeding trial that tested the impact of microbiota-directed fibres (acetylated galactoglucomannan) at critical developmental stages. From 800,000 features including microbial and host genes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and metabolites from caecal tissue and digesta, we used multiset correlation and factor analysis to select the most relevant features for capturing coordinated patterns across omic layers. From these features, we predicted over 2,000 putative host-microbiome interactions based on co-occurrence. Some of them reflected previously known relationships between animal and microbiome features, such as microbial genes for carbohydrate metabolism being linked to glycoside abundances in host tissue. Other predicted co-occurrences included features that were not detected in single-omic analysis and offer new hypotheses of host-microbiome interactions that warrant future investigation. Hence, we showcase an application of holo-omic analysis that avoids common pitfalls in high-dimensional data analysis; identifies known interactions as a form of validation; and most importantly, predicts new leads for understanding host-microbiome symbiosis.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

High TAM infiltration into the TME is also associated with increased resistance to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death. However, the exact mechanism by which TAMs make the cancer cells resistant to ferroptosis remains relatively unexplored. Here, we have investigated how TAMs modify iron metabolism in GBM cells to make them more resistant to ferroptotic stress. We utilized GL261 cells, a GBM cell line derived from C57BL6 mice, and syngeneic primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) to study GBM-TAM interactions in vitro. We found that male macrophages exhibited higher iron uptake, greater iron storage, and a larger labile iron pool compared to female macrophages, indicating intrinsic sex biases in macrophage iron metabolism. Subsequently, we used co-culture experiments to study how macrophages regulate the iron and ferroptotic status of GL261 cells. We discovered that GL261 cells cocultured with BMDMs showed higher resistance to RSL3-induced ferroptotic stress. Mechanistically, BMDMs caused a decrease in total cellular iron in GL261 cells by inducing increased H-ferritin-bound iron release via CD63-positive exosomes; thus, limiting the amount of iron that is available for lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis. This process was moderately sex biased in favor of male macrophages. Finally, we show that this mechanism of BMDM-induced resistance to ferroptosis is independent of Hepcidin regulation and can act as a possible pathway by which GBM cells escape ferroptotic stress during proinflammatory conditions.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

As a multidimensional construct, fatigue encompasses physical, cognitive, and emotional components, complicating efforts to understand PSF pathophysiological mechanisms and identify key predictors. We aimed to investigate the impact of lesion characteristics on the different facets of PSF while accounting for socio-demographic, psychological, and neurological factors. 231 first-ever ischemic stroke patients from a prospective hospital-based cohort were assessed using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) alongside routine clinical evaluations. Lesion analysis was done through two approaches: a voxel-based method using support vector regression-based multivariate lesion-symptom mapping (SVR-LSM), and a network-based method using principal component analysis (PCA) of lesioned gray and white matter regions. The overall prevalence of PSF was 20.8%. PSF was more frequent among women and younger patients and strongly associated with HAD scores. SVR-LSM identified an association between lesions in the right corona radiata and external capsule and total MFI scores but none with HAD scores. The network-based approach showed associations between mental fatigue and reduced activity subdimensions and brain components involving cerebro-cerebellar tracts. Our findings suggest that PSF arises from an interplay of socio-demographic, emotional, and cerebral risk factors, accounting for its heterogeneous presentation. Regarding the associations with the lesioned regions, the involvement of motor pathways raises the possibility that neuronal overactivity, compensating for disrupted networks, may contribute to long-term fatigue.

D.", "abstract": "We understand how neurons respond selectively to patterns in visual input to support object recognition; however, how these circuits support perceptual grouping, illusory percepts, and imagination is not understood. These perceptual experiences are thought to require combining what we have learned about the world with incoming sensory signals, yet the neural mechanism for this integration remains unclear. Here we show that networks tuned for object recognition implicitly learn the distribution of their input, which can be accessed through feedback connections that tune synaptic weights. We introduce Generative Inference, a computational framework in which feedback pathways that adjust connection weights during learning are repurposed during perception to combine learned knowledge with sensory input, fulfilling flexible inference goals such as increasing confidence. Generative Inference enables networks tuned solely for recognition to spontaneously produce perceptual grouping, illusory contours, shape completion, and pattern formation resembling imagination, while preserving their recognition abilities. The framework reproduces neural signatures observed across perceptual experiments: delayed responses in feedback-receiving layers of early visual cortex that disappear when feedback connections are disrupted. We show that, under stated assumptions, gradients of classification error approximate directions that are informative about the data distribution, establishing a theoretical connection between recognition and generation. Together, these findings show that pattern recognition and pattern generation rely on a shared computational substrate through dual use of feedback pathways. This principle explains how neural systems recognize familiar objects reliably while remaining flexible enough to interpret incomplete or ambiguous information, and suggests that reusing learning signals for perception may be a general feature of both biological brains and artificial networks.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the protective function of beta catenin stabilization in T cells and its impact on PH. Using a novel transgenic mouse model (CAT Tg) with stabilized beta catenin, we demonstrate that beta-catenin stabilization induces a distinct T cell phenotype characterized by an expansion of central effector memory cells (CD44+, CD122+, Eomes, T-bet+). Mechanistically, this effect was associated with suppression of key proinflammatory pathways, including reduced phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and JAK1. PH was induced using pristane, and CAT Tg mice were significantly protected from lung damage, showing reduced proteinuria and decreased pulmonary proinflammatory cytokine production compared with wild-type (WT) and T cell specific beta catenin knockout (cKO) mice. This protection correlated with a marked increase in FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in CAT Tg mice. We further identified a novel mechanism in which beta-catenin stabilization enhances lung expression of Amphiregulin and BATF, two molecules essential for Treg function and tissue repair. Adoptive transfer of CAT Tg Tregs into WT mice with pristane-induced PH conferred superior protection, as evidenced by reduced lung inflammation and proteinuria. The systemic administration of a beta catenin agonist to mice with PH significantly attenuated disease severity. Our bioinformatic analysis confirmed that beta catenin stabilization upregulates pathways associated with tissue repair and immune homeostasis, including PI3K, Akt, angiogenesis, and STAT5 signaling. Collectively, these findings reveal that beta-catenin stabilization protects against pulmonary hemorrhage by inducing a specialized T cell phenotype and establishing a protective Amphiregulin BATF Treg axis.

At 60 minutes, AprA increased levels of 211 proteins and reduced levels of 57 proteins while polyP increased levels of 152 proteins and reduced levels of 168 proteins. Surprisingly, many of the AprA- and polyP-regulated proteins are associated with RNA metabolism and ribosomes. AprA and polyP both upregulated 19 proteins, one protein was downregulated by both, and one was upregulated by AprA and downregulated by polyP. AprA increased phosphorylation of 12 proteins and decreased phosphorylation of 60 proteins. PolyP increased phosphorylation of 7 proteins and decreased phosphorylation of 18 proteins.

Both AprA and polyP decreased phosphorylation of six proteins including the Ras-interacting protein RipA and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as the RacGEF GxcT . Mutants lacking RipA or GxcT were unresponsive to both AprA and polyP chemorepulsion.

We previously uncovered the necessity of apical microtubule meshwork reorganisation in patterning apical constriction dynamics, and demonstrated its reliance on EB1-dependent microtubule growth and Patronin-dependent non-centrosomal nucleation. Here we discover the requirement for Dynein-Dynactin complex functions in patterning cell morphodynamics in the amnioserosa.

It then quickly regenerates, a process critical for the maintenance of placental functions including nutrient transfer and protection from infections. To investigate this process, we developed apical-out trophoblast organoids from first-trimester placentas and induced mechanical damage to the syncytium. We observed spontaneous regeneration of syncytiotrophoblast both morphologically and functionally. TNFRSF12A, the TWEAK receptor, was identified as a potential enhancer of syncytiotrophoblast regeneration. Supplementation with recombinant TWEAK in organoids increased the expression of cell proliferation and fusion markers, promoting syncytiotrophoblast formation. The source of TWEAK was found to be macrophages derived from maternal blood monocytes that adhere to sites of syncytiotrophoblast damage in vivo. This in vitro model that allows the exploration of syncytial biology has relevance for important pregnancy disorders including pre-eclampsia, where breaks occur more often, and vertical infections, where maternal monocytes could be a source of transmission.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

We found that spring and autumn phenology impose asymmetric controls on growing season length, with spring regulating interannual variation and autumn driving long-term trends. Spring phenology across all species was primarily controlled by temperature, while autumn phenology was influenced by spring phenology and an interacting suite of species-specific environmental factors.

However, current understanding of the mechanistic controls on SOM biochemistry and decay, and how these may be affected by climate change, is still incomplete. As such, the primary objectives of this study are to assess (1) the trajectory of organic matter decomposition and stabilization from undecayed plant root litter to mineral SOM and (2) how these processes are altered by anthropogenic nitrogen (N) deposition by using high-resolution SOM biochemical and microbiome datasets and a long-term field experiment in the Upper Great Lakes region of North America. N deposition did not significantly alter the biochemical composition of SOM in the undecomposed and 1-year decomposed samples but did alter mineral SOM biochemistry. This shift was attributed to changes in the relative abundance of specific biochemical compounds rather than changes in more broadly defined compound classes, such as lipids, for example. A reduced association between SOM biochemistry and microbial decomposer communities under N deposition was also observed. Taken together, atmospheric N deposition altered the composition of mineral SOM and decoupled the relationship between microbial composition and SOM biochemistry, likely contributing to the previously observed reduction in the decomposition of SOM while not significantly altering SOMs overall biochemistry.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

The mechanical advantage hypothesis (MAH) proposes that the central nervous system (CNS) optimises the distribution of grasping forces by favouring fingers with longer moment arms. While existing research has established that the applicability of MAH is influenced by biomechanical constraints, it remains unclear whether cognitive load, a distinct dimension of task difficulty, can similarly induce this force-sharing strategy. To investigate this, we examined whether increased cognitive demands during a multi-finger grasp-and-lift task would trigger force distribution patterns that exploit mechanical advantage. The results showed that while participants completed the task successfully, contrary to our hypothesis, the increased cognitive load did not result in a disproportionate rise in the normal force exerted by the little finger compared to the ring finger. This finding suggests that the employment of optimisation strategies like mechanical advantage may be predominantly sensitive to biomechanical rather than cognitive constraints.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Among them, immune cell-derived sEVs are uniquely positioned to couple innate immunomodulatory activities with therapeutic payload delivery, making them highly attractive for cancer therapy. In particular, M1 macrophage-derived sEVs (M1-sEVs) preserve the tumor-suppressive functions of their parent cells, including tumor microenvironment (TME) reprogramming, immune activation, and inhibition of cancer progression. However, the mechanisms by which these activities are coordinated within the TME, and whether they act independently or synergistically, remain poorly understood. Clarifying these mechanisms is crucial for harnessing their intrinsic bioactivity in combination with their natural capacity as drug delivery nanocarriers to optimize therapeutic efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that M1-sEVs exhibit intrinsic stability and circulation longevity via \"do not eat me\" ligands, as well as tumor-homing ability revealed by proteomic profiling, enabling efficient uptake and deep infiltration in breast cancer models. Functionally, M1-sEVs deliver antiproliferative microRNAs that suppress tumor metabolism, growth, and progression by inhibiting self-renewal, adhesion, migration, motility, and invasion. Importantly, by integrating this endogenous bioactivity with exogenous doxorubicin loading, we achieved synergistic efficacy: a 3-fold reduction in IC50 in vitro (0.46 uM vs. 1.45 uM for free drug) and 70.18% tumor growth inhibition in vivo. These findings highlight M1-sEVs as dual-action nanotherapeutics that combine innate immune-regulatory and tumor-inhibitory functions with efficient drug delivery, advancing their development as powerful platforms for cancer therapy.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

We sought to identify contributors to cachexia using a murine model of lung cancer that reproduces key features of this syndrome. A multiplex cytokine screening approach, integrated with western blot and transcriptomic analyses, identified tumor-derived inflammatory mediators and downstream signaling pathways associated with cachexia. Notably, IL-6 superfamily members were elevated in the tumor and plasma of mice and patients with cachexia. The JAK-STAT3 signaling was upregulated in liver and skeletal muscle, driving the acute phase response and impairing lipid metabolism. Pharmacologic inhibition of JAK1/2 with ruxolitinib improved body weight, fat mass, and overall survival without altering tumor burden. These effects were driven primarily by blunted hypothalamic leptin receptor signaling, which increased food intake early in the disease course. In the liver, JAK inhibition reduced STAT3 activity, restored fatty acid oxidation, and decreased the production of acute-phase proteins.

Given that recent advances in nutritional interventions have been recognized as potential strategies for targeting cancer, we investigated the role of dietary serine restriction in OSCC cell plasticity. Utilizing multiple human OSCC-derived cell lines and an orthotopic syngeneic mouse model of OSCC, we interrogated the impact of serine deprivation on this malignancy through biochemical assays, transcriptomic analyses, and CUT&RUN sequencing, as well as impact on tumor growth and its immune environment. We report that human OSCC cells behaved like serine auxotrophs, depending on exogenous serine for growth and maintenance of plastic cell states. We show that dietary restriction of serine induced endogenous serine synthesis and generated alpha-ketoglutarate (KG), a co-substrate for JMJD3 nuclear dioxygenase, which demethylates H3K27me3 and de-represses differentiation genes. This was accompanied by the reduction of H3K4me3 at stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes caused. Likewise, dietary serine restriction inhibited orthotopic OSCC isograft growth in mice concomitant with downregulation of H3K27me3 and increased immune infiltration in the tumor periphery. Collectively, our study provides new insights into the epigenetic etiology of OSCC that reveals the interplay between serine metabolism and epigenetic molecular mechanisms driving OSCC cell plasticity and tumorigenesis.

Because blur increases the speed of visual processing by a few milliseconds, these optical conditions can induce dramatic misperceptions of the distances and 3D directions of moving objects. To date, however, the illusion has been demonstrated in only non-presbyopic individuals. We analyze the prevalence of both the processing speed differences and the visibility of the resulting illusions in the presbyopic and general populations.17 presbyopes (54.4 +/- 5.9years) and 36 non-presbyopes (22.2 +/- 5.0years) participated. The proportions of these participant populations approximately match their proportions in the general population. Two strips of horizontally moving bars were presented on an autostereoscopic display with interocular blur and light-level differences. The task was to report which strip appeared closer in depth. Blur- and light-level differences caused illusions that are respectively known as the reverse and classic Pulfrich effects. Interocular delay and an illusion visibility index - the ratio of interocular delay and the detection threshold-were obtained from each participant for both blur and light-level differences between the eyes. Blur- and light-level differences cause highly significant changes in processing speed at the individual and group levels. (The two populations were statistically indistinguishable in their susceptibility to stimulus-induced processing speed differences.) The reverse and classic Pulfrich effects occurred in 94% and in 96%, respectively, of the general participant population. The visibility index showed that the processing speed discrepancy exceeded the detection threshold in a smaller number of participants - 30% and 43%, respectively. Interocular differences in optical blur reliably cause interocular differences in processing speed across presbyopic and non-presbyopic populations, although they create visible (suprathreshold) illusions in only a subset of participants. However, this subset included individuals with processing delays that were many times larger than the detection threshold. These latter participants are likely to be afflicted by large, highly visible illusions in real-world conditions. Methods for reducing or eliminating these illusions are discussed.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Often these studies are done on small bespoke (boutique) datasets (N<100) and analysed in isolation of other M/EEG datasets. Instead of training a new model for each boutique study, which is computationally expensive, we propose the use of a canonical HMM. This provides a common reference through which different studies can be described using the same set of networks. We provide HMMs for a range of model orders (4-16 states) in parcellated source space and sensor space. These HMMs were trained on 1849 MEG recordings (N=621, 18-88 years old, 194 hours), capturing population variability in both rest and task data. We illustrate applications of this canonical HMM approach in parcellated source space using boutique MEG and EEG datasets. Applying the canonical HMM in parcel space requires the boutique dataset to be preprocessed and source reconstructed in the same way as the canonical HMM training data. Apply the canonical HMM in the sensor space requires the same sensor layout and preprocessing as the canonical HMM training data.

However, studying TRM cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been challenging due to limitations in existing tumor models. Traditional cell lines injected subcutaneously fail to replicate the biological cues of dermal and epidermal tumors, and many genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) lack a specific tumor antigen for tracking immune responses. Here, we use an autochthonous Braf/PTEN model of melanoma, modified to express OVA as a tumor-specific model antigen, to show that CD103+ TRM-like cells orchestrate the initial antitumor immune response and this response is antagonized by infiltration of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Longitudinal spatial profiling (cyclic immunofluorescence) and flow cytometry analysis of Braf/PTEN/OVA mice show that TRM-like cells rapidly fill a stable niche in the tumor. These TRM-like cells are phenotypically and transcriptionally distinct from other T cells, expressing low levels of PD-1 and Tim-3, but uniquely expressed CD101 and GzmB. Depletion of Treg cells led to augmentation of the OVA-specific antitumor immune response involving activation of TRM-like CD8+ TILs, substantial CD8+ and CD4+ T cell infiltration, and a decrease in tumor growth. Depletion of CD8+ T cells prior to Treg depletion blunted T cell recruitment to the tumor. These data show that immune escape is mediated by the ability of Tregs to suppress early antitumor responses and T cell recruitment by TRM-like cells.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Yet, the impact of long-term maize breeding over the past century on stomatal traits and their responses to climate factors remains poorly understood. We evaluated stomatal traits at the seedling stage in 27 maize hybrids released from 1920 to 2022, grown under controlled conditions. Modern hybrids (2013 - 2022) had a smaller total stomatal pore area (9.17 x 108 m2) than (1920 - 2012) historical ERA hybrids (9.94 x 108 m2; p[&le;] 0.001), a higher stomatal density (47.2 per mm-2) vs. historical ERA hybrids (44.5), and a smaller leaf area (17.9 cm2 vs. 20.5 cm2). No significant differences were found in the size (m2), length (m), or width (m) of stomata between the two groups. Stomatal density increased, while all other traits decreased in modern hybrids. Stomatal density was negatively correlated with stomatal size (r = -0.62), length (r = -0.57), width (r = -0.54), and leaf area (r = -0.54).

The most frequent (~50%) alterations in OCCC are AT-rich interactive domain 1A gene (ARID1A) mutations which lead to ARID1A deficiency. However, OCCC that retains ARID1A function differs substantially from ARID1A mutated OCCC. Particularly, targeted therapies that sensitize ARID1A-deficient OCCC to DNA damage are largely ineffective against OCCC with wild-type (wt) ARID1A. Thus, it is important to identify druggable targets and develop targeted therapies specifically for ARID1A-wt OCCC. We identified BMAL2 as a critical OCCC oncogene that promotes tumorigenesis by preventing DNA damage from endogenous origins. BMAL2 depletion altered expression of genes in DNA damage repair pathways, including RAD51, a core enzyme of the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. This led to double-stranded break accumulation, decreased cell viability and reduced tumor growth. This dependence on BMAL2 to maintain DNA integrity and cell viability can be a new route to suppress ARID1A-wt OCCC. Consistent with this idea, we found that GW833972A, a cannabinoid receptor agonist, bound BMAL2 with high affinity and facilitated its degradation. This in turn reduced RAD51 expression, leading to an accumulation of DNA damage and decreased cell viability. Xenograft models further demonstrated that GW833972A treatment alone inhibited ARID1A-wt OCCC tumor growth. Together, our findings reveal an essential oncogenic role of BMAL2 and demonstrate that it is an appealing therapeutic target, especially for ARID1A-wt OCCC.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

However, the number, organization, and functions of its domains remain debated. Using AlphaFold2-based structural modeling, we investigated two structurally disordered regions with potential regulatory functions: (i) a 16-residue linker between the Helicase (Hel) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains, proposed as a cleavage site and/or a flexible hinge, and (ii) the RdRp C-terminal tail, suggested to modulate polymerase activity through conformational plasticity. We performed mutagenesis of the Hel/RdRp linker and analyzed the impact of mutations on ORF1 maturation, subcellular localization, and replication efficiency. Using an extensive antibody panel combined with precise protein sizing, we found that ORF1 is predominantly expressed as a full-length protein with an apparent molecular weight of ~235 kDa by SDS-PAGE, together with several low-abundance truncated products, including the previously described HEV-derived SMAD activator (HDSA) fragment. These results suggest that ORF1 likely undergoes post-translational modifications and partial maturation by cellular proteases and/or spontaneous truncations in exposed regions. Importantly, Hel/RdRp linker mutations did not alter the ORF1 expression profile or subcellular localization, arguing against cleavage within this region. However, substitutions of conserved residues in the linker strongly impaired HEV replication, highlighting the functional importance of this disordered segment for viral genome replication. Similarly, deletions or substitutions within the last 20 C-terminal RdRp residues abolished or severely impaired HEV replication. This demonstrates that the conformational flexibility of the RdRp C-terminal segment is likely critical for ORF1 function, e.g. for polymerase activity. In conclusion, although ORF1 likely undergoes tightly regulated processing, cleavage is unlikely to occur within the Hel/RdRp linker. Nevertheless, this segment and the conformational dynamics of the RdRp C-terminus emerge as key regulatory elements required for efficient HEV replication, pointing to novel mechanistic layers of control in the HEV replication process.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

However, less is known about whether microbiota-mediated effects are consistent across host species, as our understanding of such interactions may be affected by publication bias. Following on from a large study of 36 species of Drosophilidae challenged with four bacterial pathogens, we identified two candidate host species that might have protective microbiome based on low susceptibility and high abundance of the culturable microbiota; we selected two other host species for comparison. We tested whether germ-reduced flies, and flies with a natural or re-constituted microbiome, varied in their susceptibility to systemic infection with two bacterial pathogens (Providencia rettgeri and Staphylococcus aureus) and one viral pathogen (Drosophila C Virus). The composition and abundance of the bacterial microbiota varied between species and microbiome treatments. We found an overall interaction between host species and pathogen type, confirming previous work that host species vary in their susceptibility in a pathogen-specific manner. Similarly, we found that microbiome treatments had differing effects on host survival among host species, although effect sizes tended to be small. In D. putrida individuals with manipulated microbiomes showed increased susceptibility to all pathogens tested; in other hosts altered susceptibility was pathogen dependent. While there are always challenges to manipulating microbiomes, especially across multiple host species, our results indicate that host microbiota may play limited roles on survival in systemic infection in these four species.

Here, we show that OM-89 (Uro-Vaxom (R)), an E. coli lysate, reprograms epithelial antimicrobial responses to enhance intracellular bacterial clearance. Using murine bladder organoids and epithelial cell monolayers, we demonstrate that OM-89 enhances lysosomal acidification and cathepsin activity, promoting trafficking of UPEC into degradative compartments. Unexpectedly, OM-89 also increases epithelial uptake of antibiotics, increasing their intracellular potency and reducing UPEC regrowth after treatment. This dual effect on epithelial immunity and antibiotic accessibility was conserved across multiple UPEC strains and antibiotic classes. Our findings position bladder epithelial cells as active players in the host defense and highlight OM-89 as a tool to amplify their antimicrobial potential, offering a promising adjunctive strategy against intracellular bacterial persistence.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

This study aims to elucidate the effects of Pseudomonas amygdali pv. tabaci 6605 flagella (Wild type, {Delta}fliC strain) and its glycosylation ({Delta}fgt1 and {Delta}fgt2 strains) on bacterial transport and deposition in sandy porous media through a combination of experimental observations and numerical simulations. Flagella play a key role in bacterial transport and deposition dynamics through its surface properties. Its intrinsic hydrophobicity enhances bacterial adhesion and promotes deposition onto sandy grains, while simultaneously limiting transport through the porous medium. However, glycosylation of flagellin introduces hydrophilic glycans, which counteract this effect by increasing the overall hydrophilicity of the bacterial surface. As a result, glycosylated flagella facilitate bacterial mobility and improves recovery in the effluent, while reducing retention within the sand matrix. These findings highlight the critical influence of flagellas biochemical modifications on bacterial behavior in porous environments. They provide valuable insights for understanding and managing microbial contamination in subsurface systems.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

In particular, up to half of AD patients harbor limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC). This co-pathology, characterized by mislocalized and aggregated TDP-43, predominantly in the medial temporal lobe, is associated with accelerated clinical decline and more severe tau pathology. Whether there is a structural basis for this clinical synergy remains unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we determine the structure of tau filaments from three AD patients with LATE-NC.

Using occurrence, phenology, and color data from community science datasets, we reconstructed communities of co-flowering assemblages and calculated standardized effect sizes of mean pairwise distances for both flower color and phylogenetic relatedness. We analyzed seasonal trends using mixed models and assessed whether closely related species co-flowered non-randomly with respect to color similarity using bootstrap correlations. We found that, on average, co-flowering assemblages were overdispersed for both flower color and phylogeny. However, flower color dispersion significantly decreased over the growing season, while phylogenetic dispersion significantly increased, reflecting a pattern in which co-flowering assemblages shifted to more distantly related but similarly colored assemblages. Finally, color and phylogenetic dispersion were negatively correlated across communities, indicating that communities composed of more closely related species tended to exhibit more dissimilar flowers.

Transcriptional heterogeneity among treatment-naive SCLC tumors underlies four transcriptional subtypes, each with distinct clinical vulnerabilities. Though previously hypothesized to delineate a distinct subtype, expression of YAP1 is largely absent from treatment-naive, pure SCLC. To characterize relapsed SCLC, circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, and core needle biopsies from SCLC patients and preclinical models following resistance to standard-of-care therapies were analyzed. In contrast to treatment-naive SCLC, these analyses reveal an emergent YAP1-positive cell population that coincides with treatment resistance. These YAP1-positive cells exhibit characteristics of drug tolerant persister cells, including senescence, stemness, and plasticity, as YAP1 positive cells largely abandon features characteristic of SCLC to adopt those of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). As a result of this SCLC-like to LCNEC-like evolution, YAP1-positive cells lack several clinically relevant SCLC surface targets (i.e., DLL3, SEZ6), but are enriched for others (i.e., B7-H3, TROP2). We propose a model where YAP1 expressing cells emerge with SCLC treatment resistance and characterize a tenacious subpopulation capable of diverging from the treatment naive lineage and adopting features to evade therapeutic response.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

M.; Lamichhane, G.", "abstract": "Background. The incidence of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections has been rising and now exceeds tuberculosis in several countries. Among NTMs, Mycobacterium avium is the most common cause of chronic lung disease. Current guidelines recommend simultaneous administration of three or more antibiotics, modeled after tuberculosis treatment, but these regimens are limited by toxicity, poor adherence, and low cure rates. Importantly, unlike M. tuberculosis, M. avium is acquired from the environment rather than transmitted between humans, weakening the rationale for multidrug therapy as a strategy to suppress resistance at the population level. Methods. To test an alternative treatment approach, we evaluated sequential monotherapy in a validated murine model of chronic M. avium lung infection. Mice were treated with either the standard triple-drug regimen of clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifampicin or with sequential monotherapy: clarithromycin, bedaquiline, and clofazimine, with only one drug administered at a time for four-week intervals. Lung and spleen bacterial burdens were quantified, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for isolates recovered during treatment to assess resistance emergence. Results. Sequential monotherapy achieved reductions in lung bacterial burden equivalent to those of the standard multidrug regimen and prevented extrapulmonary dissemination. Notably, no increase in MICs was observed for clarithromycin, bedaquiline, or clofazimine across treatment phases, indicating that sequential monotherapy did not select for resistant clones. Conclusions. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that sequential monotherapy can deliver efficacy comparable to multidrug therapy for M. avium disease without promoting resistance. This proof-of-concept supports further investigation of sequencing strategies as a potentially more tolerable alternative to current regimens.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Mosquito-borne diseases are a major global health concern, infecting up to 700 million people annually and causing over one million deaths. Of the several genera of biting mosquito, species of Anopheles are mostly studied for their ability (termed vector competence) to transmit Plasmodium protozoan parasites, some species of which cause malaria. More than 480 species of Anopheles have been described worldwide and about 70 of these are responsible for Plasmodium spp. transmission. However, the focus on Anopheles as vectors of Plasmodium has led to a relative lack of study about the ability of Anopheles to transmit viruses. Some Anopheles species have been previously confirmed competent for various arboviruses. In most cases they are secondary vectors, with relatively low competence, contributing to overall transmission while other species of mosquito or other vector are responsible for sustained transmission. While secondary vectors may contribute little to transmission, they may play important epidemiological roles by extending the length of the season and/or providing a means of overwintering. Here, we conducted an extensive review of scientific repositories, accessing a diverse range of journals and reports to build an exhaustive database of known Anopheles competence for arboviruses. Opinion pieces, modelling papers lacking experimental confirmation, and papers without vector competence data were excluded. In total, we reviewed 7,343 papers, and after exclusions, we retained 427 papers. We analysed these data, cross referenced with ability to diapause and geographical range. Our results show that some Anopheles spp. have the potential to be secondary vectors of some arboviruses, as well as undergoing diapause as adults in temperate regions of their range. Hence, we infer they could also play an epidemiologically important role in the overwintering of mosquito-borne viruses.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

S.; Coveney, C. R.; Ganapathee, D. S.; Capellini, T. D.", "abstract": "Every element of the human skeleton exhibits some differences in comparison to our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. Many of these skeletal modifications underpin key events in human evolution, enabling our species to walk upright, manipulate tools with precision, and support enlarged brains. Identifying the genomic changes that underlie these features remains an outstanding challenge due to the substantial number of differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes. To identify human-chimp sequence differences that modulate gene expression in the developing postcranial skeleton, we used a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to screen the human and chimp versions of 70,000 regulatory elements present in the prenatal skeletal template for differential activity. After testing our library in two cartilage and one bone marrow-derived lymphoblast line, we identify 30,736 regions (45.2%) with activity in our assay. Of the active regions, we find that 11,542 (37.6%; or 17% of the entire pool) regions exhibited differential activity between the human and chimpanzee. We find that human ancestor quickly evolved regions (HAQERs) were predictive of differential activity while Human Accelerated Regions were not and both sets failed to predict the magnitude of effect, unlike the total number of base pair differences between species, which was weakly correlated with effect size. These findings reveal that human skeletal evolution involves widespread regulatory changes distributed across thousands of elements rather than concentrated effects at a few key loci, supporting a polygenic model for the evolution of complex morphological traits.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Among implicated genes, BRD1 has emerged as an epigenetic regulator of neurodevelopment with broad relevance for several psychiatric or mental diagnostic categories. To investigate its functional impact, we generated a genetically modified Gottingen minipig model harboring a monoallelic deletion in BRD1, enabling translational analyses of its role in brain development and systemic physiology. BRD1 haploinsufficient minipigs showed normal growth and exploratory behavior but displayed subtle, age-progressive alterations in reward processing. Longitudinal brain imaging revealed structural changes, particularly in the cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus, that attenuated over time, thus mirroring developmental trajectories observed in psychiatric disorders. Transcriptomic profiling across brain regions uncovered differential expression of genes involved in synaptic signaling, mitochondrial function, and metabolic regulation. These changes were accompanied by brain metabolomic shifts, notably in glutathione and selenoamino acid metabolism. Crucially, these alterations extended beyond the brain. Peripheral transcriptomics revealed systemic metabolic reprogramming, paralleled by consistent shifts in plasma metabolomic and lipidomic profiles, including altered sucrose and phospholipid species, and modestly reduced blood glucose levels. Together, these findings demonstrate that BRD1 haploinsufficiency disrupts neurodevelopmental and metabolic homeostasis and is accompanied by systemic molecular signatures detectable in peripheral tissues. This work provides mechanistic insight into the biological consequences of psychiatric genetic risk and underscores the value of cross-species, multi-omics models in psychiatric research.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Analysis of the snake genomes shows the populations surveyed exhibit relatively low levels of inbreeding and are genetically distinct, but that the degree of separation correlates only weakly with geographic distance. A genome-wide association analysis identified a locus associated with black-to-yellow color variation that contains an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene (ALDH4A1) related to genes involved in hair color differences in humans.

A.; Christianson, D.

Since then, four additional boronic acid-based drugs have been approved for clinical use in the treatment of cancer, fungal and bacterial infections, and eczema. The boron atom is inherently electrophilic due to being electron deficient, so the mode of inhibition by a boronic acid very often involves addition of a nucleophile, such as an enzyme-bound residue or a water molecule, to yield a tetrahedral boronate anion. Recently, a new class of boronic acid-based inhibitors of human phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) have been reported, along with the 2.7 [A]-resolution crystal structure of PDE3B complexed with one of these inhibitors, GSK4394835A [Rowley et al. (2024) Discovery and SAR study of boronic acid-based selective PDE3B inhibitors from a novel DNA-encoded library. J. Med. Chem. 67, 2049-2065]. Surprisingly, the boronic acid moiety of the inhibitor was reported to bind as an intact, unreacted boronic acid. Additional discrepancies were evident in the reported refinement statistics, so we downloaded structure factor amplitudes from the Protein Data Bank (accession code 8SYC) and re-solved the structure. Our initial electron density maps clearly indicated nucleophilic addition of H737 to the boronic acid moiety of the inhibitor, generating a tetrahedral boronate anion in the active site. We re-refined the structure with excellent refinement statistics, concluding that GSK4394835A is a reversible covalent inhibitor of PDE3B.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Current strategies to manipulate MSN levels rely mainly on genetic or environmental approaches, which are slow and lack temporal control. Chemical tools such as photocaged MSN analogues could provide such temporal control over MSN levels. However, the high negative charge of MSNs prevents spontaneous passage through the complex bacterial cell envelope. Here, we report the synthesis of photocaged, clickable, and isotope-labeled MSN analogues and their delivery into Escherichia coli comparing different approaches. A cyclodextrin-based synthetic nucleotide transporter provides particular advantages. Upon 400nm irradiation, these probes were photo-released inside living cells, where we tracked their conversion from pppGpp to ppGpp by capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry and studied their ability to alter growth in a (p)ppGpp mutant. This work provides the first demonstration that highly charged, photocaged MSNs can traverse the bacterial envelope, be photo-released intracellularly, and be metabolically tracked in real time.

Two independent AlphaFold-enabled screens converged on a small set of proteins; integrating apoptosis connectivity and astrocyte enrichment prioritized pyruvate carboxylase (PC). Docking placed L-AAA in the pyruvate/acetyl-CoA pocket of PC and supported stereoselective engagement over D-AAA. These results motivate a testable model in which L-AAA limits PC-driven anaplerosis in astrocytes, constraining oxaloacetate/aspartate supply and redox buffering to lower the threshold for apoptosis.

In this pairing, growth of C. ljungdahlii is constrained by C. acetobutylicum, since C. ljungdahlii relies on C. acetobutylicum to convert glucose into CO2, which C. ljungdahlii can use as a carbon and electron sources. However, this dependence is unilateral; C. acetobutylicum growth is not constrained by C. ljungdahlii. Consequently, population ratios between the two species can vary substantially throughout the course of fermentation and in different fermentation setups, typically with the faster growing C. acetobutylicum outcompeting C. ljungdahlii. Population ratio is an important variable because it influences metabolite yields and productivity and likely also impacts the initiation and frequency of the heterologous cell fusion events we have documented between C. acetobutylicum and C. ljungdahlii. Thus, developing methods to rationally control and maintain the population ratio are important for both biotechnological applications and fundamental study of this coculture pairing. In this study we show that the different nitrogen utilization capabilities of these two organisms enable engineering of a mutualistic mixotrophic syntrophy in which C. ljungdahlii relies on C. acetobutylicum for carbon and electrons and C. acetobutylicum relies on C. ljungdahlii for nitrogen. First, we confirm that C. ljungdahlii, but not C. acetobutylicum, can convert nitrate into biologically useful ammonium, enabling the design of a culture medium in which C. acetobutylicum can only grow in the presence of C. ljungdahlii. Second, we test different ratios of nitrate to ammonium in batch cocultures and demonstrate that rapid nitrate utilization by C. ljungdahlii prevents C. acetobutylicum from becoming nitrogen-limited at any point in batch fermentation. Finally, we show that feeding different rates of nitrate to cocultures in fed-batch mode enables control of the coculture growth rate, maintenance of stable population ratios, and higher isopropanol and butanol yields in cocultures between C. acetobutylicum and C. ljungdahlii.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Pathogenic variants in the SCN8A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel critical for action potential generation in the brain, account for ~1% of genetic epilepsies. The voltage sensor in SCN8A domain 1 is encoded by one of two developmentally-regulated mutually exclusive alternative exons, 5N and 5A. We observe that variants in these exons are more likely to cause infantile spasms, a severe seizure type, than variants elsewhere in SCN8A, and that some pathogenic variants affect exon 5 splicing, impacting patient phenotype. Molecular and evolutionary analyses implicate the exon sequences of these and other voltage-gated ion channel alternative exons in splicing regulation. We identified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that shift splicing of SCN8A exon 5N to 5A or vice versa. These ASOs normalize neuronal activity in patient-derived iPSC neurons, and reduce seizures and motor impairment and extend lifespan in a new exon 5N mutant mouse model. Our results demonstrate that splice-switching ASOs can effectively reduce the expression of pathogenic isoforms and rescue both seizure and non-seizure phenotypes. Similar approaches should be applicable to pediatric genetic epilepsies caused by mutations in other ion channel alternative exons.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

We characterize the spike loop2 region as a critical determinant of ACE2 receptor specificity, directly interacting with the receptor, and show that the bat HKU5r-CoV with the closest loop2 sequence to nvHKU5r-CoV could already utilize mink ACE2. Using AlphaFold3, we predicted spike-ACE2 binding interfaces consistent with our experimental infectivity results.

Molecular dating suggests that nvHKU5r-CoV transmitted from bats to mink within the last decade, consistent with an expansion of mink fur farming in China.

J.; Wulstein, D.", "abstract": "Coral reef decline has prompted a global surge in reef restoration initiatives. The success of initiatives that aim to sustain coral populations or assemblages will depend on demographic principles. Restoration strategies generally follow two demographic pathways: additive approaches, which increase population numbers by introducing recruits, fragments, or adults without altering vital rates; and multiplicative approaches, which enhance vital rates-growth, survival, or reproduction-either extrinsically (e.g., herbivory, habitat protection) or intrinsically (e.g., assisted evolution). We synthesized 34 coral matrix population models spanning morphologically diverse coral species from the Caribbean, Hawaii and the Great Barrier Reef, to quantify additive and multiplicative changes needed to increase population growth. Results highlight two consistent demographic leverage points for which population growth was most sensitive:(1) survival of reproductive adults and (2) successful recruitment. Achieving a 5% increase in population growth rate through additive means required ~100 recruit outplants or 5-10 adult outplants per 1,000 individuals in a population annually. For large populations typical of restoration targets (105-107 individuals), this translates to 103-104 outplants per year-efforts rarely logistically or economically feasible. By contrast, improving adult survival or recruitment rates by 20% (1.2 fold) produced equivalent population growth increases, depending on the fraction of the population affected. These findings yield two key implications. First, additive interventions are inefficient for large populations and demand sustained, large-scale effort. Second, strategies enhancing vital rates across broad population segments represent the most effective means of boosting coral abundance, including habitat protection, the alleviation of environmental stressors, and interventions which promote long-term survival and recruitment. Our demographic framework underscores that if the restoration goal is to enhance coral cover on a sustained basis, success depends less on adding individuals and more on interventions that will lead to long-term increases in vital rates.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Focusing on West Nile Virus (WNV) and Saint Louis encephalitis Virus (SLEV) activity in avian communities of central and northern Argentina, this study delves into the intricate dynamics of exposure risk employing phylogenetic mixed models. Contrary to expectations, ecological traits displayed negligible influence on exposure risk. Instead, temperature seasonality and altitude, emerged as crucial predictors. The phylogenetic signal indicated a conserved susceptibility along the avian evolutionary tree, with Furnariidae, Turdidae and Columbidae families exhibiting higher exposure risk. These findings challenge prevailing notions about the dominant role of ecological traits in mosquito-borne pathogens. The study underscores the need for a holistic understanding, emphasizing the intricate interplay of environmental, phylogenetic, and ecological elements in shaping avian exposure to WNV and SLEV, offering vital insights for future research and public health strategies.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

DNA genomes are commonly thought to have replaced RNA genomes due to greater chemical stability, however this is a misconception. This study investigates the selection pressures acting on the macromolecular stoichiometries of ribosome-containing cells (ribocells) during the epoch of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), when DNA genomes and RNA genomes were in competition. Two selection pressures, (SP1) favoring stoichiometric simplicity of ribocell macromolecules (DNA, if any; RNA; and proteins), and (SP2) favoring minimal accumulation of unused/useless macromolecules in growing ribocells, were modeled as nonlinear optimization problems. Based on the current best estimates of the nature of LUCA, simulations showed that DNA genomes provided a robust selection advantage under these stoichiometric SPs. Moreover, results suggest that RNA-ssDNA hybrid genomes provided a stoichiometric selection advantage during the early LUCA epoch, consistent with a stepwise transition from RNA to DNA genomes. These findings indicate that DNA genomes were selected not for their inherent stability, but for their stoichiometric efficiency, resolving a long-standing question in the origin of life.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

P.; Kehlet-Delgado, H.; Jensen, K. T.; Griffitts, J. S.; Porter, S. S.", "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) provide a critical reservoir of diversity that potentiates bacterial local adaptation. However, the degree to which natural populations of MGEs and the chromosomes that host them share congruent or divergent evolutionary histories remains an open question. MGE and host chromosome phylogenies could show congruence or independence, depending on rates of MGE gain and loss, costs and benefit of MGE carriage, compatibility, and gene flow. We investigated phylogenetic congruence for two critical niche-expanding MGEs and host chromosomes using 302 genomes of wild symbiotic nitrogen-fixing Mesorhizobium bacteria. The MGEs comprise: 1) a nickel resistance island (NRI), which confers adaptation to nickel-enriched serpentine soils across replicated natural populations, and 2) a more extensive symbiosis island (SI), which enables symbiotic nitrogen fixation with a host legume. We demonstrate that the NRI, like the SI, is transmissible and its acquisition confers nickel adaptation. NRI acquisition often incurs no detectable cost, consistent with conditional neutrality during MGE-mediated adaptation. Phylogenies for the NRI, SI, and chromosome are congruent across wild strains, consistent with a history of vertical co-inheritance and/or MGE transmission primarily among close relatives. This congruence does not appear to result from barriers to gene flow, as diverse MGE and host chromosome haplotypes are broadly distributed and co-occur. Thus, despite ample ecological opportunity for admixture, distant relatives rarely transmitted MGEs, consistent with selection to maintain co-adapted genomic compartments. The SI has stronger phylogenetic congruence with the chromosome than does the smaller NRI, supporting the hypothesis that MGE complexity limits horizontal transfer among more divergent lineages. However, rare horizontal NRI transmission events among distant relatives and NRI loss appear to occur when haplotypes migrate across environments. Thus, environmentally dependent selection on migrants may periodically disrupt co-adapted MGE and chromosome haplotypes and serve as an engine of diversity.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, we discovered the positive cofactor-substrate cooperativity of SbSOMT and uncovered the underlying mechanism at structural basis. The binding kinetics analyses show that SbSOMT exhibits bilateral positive cooperativity except the unproductive pairing between SAM and product due to the steric hindrance of an additional methyl group. Unprecedentedly, two cofactor-analogous inhibitors, S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and sinefungin demonstrated opposite effects on substrate binding kinetics while attaining positive cooperativity. SAM-resembling sinefungin demonstrated higher foldchange in the acceleration of substrate association rate constant than deceleration of dissociation rate constant. Integrating SbSOMT structural insights at multiple states, we identified the dynamical W279-driven {pi}-stacking network governs the cofactor-substrate cooperativity. SbSOMT exhibits closed conformation at first-ligand bound states, where the C-terminal W279 serves as the central plane for {pi}-{pi} interaction between N-terminal H196, catalytic H282, and/or substrate. We propose that the binding of first ligand overcome the energy barrier represented by W279 {pi}-stacking network, leading to the conformational landscapes in favor to second binding event.

Using coarse-grained simulations, we mapped the transition of HIV-1 DIS RNA hairpins (HPs) to ED and identified multiple intermediates beyond the KC. The KC has an anionic pocket stabilized through the condensation of Mg2+ ions. Hence, when only K+ ions are present at physiological levels, the HPs to ED transitions occur through a different dominant pathway devoid of the KC. We also observed purine base flipping near KC hydrogen bonds, revealing the population of a sub-ensemble of intermediates. The proposed dimerization mechanism of HPs to ED, along with the sub-ensemble of KC conformations and its anionic pocket, provides a strategic framework for designing specific retroviral drugs targeting this pathway.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

We also investigated the transport of these antibiotics by efflux transporters, as well as their inhibition of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) using a HEK293 membrane vesicle transport assay. Dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin inhibited rosuvastatin transport by OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1, and the inhibition was strongest for OATP1Bs with IC50 values of 3.9 uM and 31 uM (OATP1B1) and 6.7 uM and 21 uM (OATP1B3) for dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin, respectively.

All OATPs and OATs transported dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin. Static model predictions indicated that the inhibition of OATPs, BCRP and P-glycoprotein by both compounds may be clinically relevant.

Differential serotoninergic modulation of specific aversive and rewarding dopaminergic neuron subtypes permits post-ingestive intoxication to suppress consolidation of initial odor-sugar memory and simultaneously invert reward memory plasticity into \"safety\" memory for the odor experienced without food. Fat body release of the Toll-ligand activating protease modSP, and resilience factor Turandot A, instruct malaise updates by triggering autocrine Toll signaling in the same brain dopaminergic neurons that form and consolidate initial sugar memory.

The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in the midbrain has been established as an important site of opioid action and is an integral hub in behavioral modulation. To investigate the functional significance of DRN opioid signaling in aversive and appetitive behaviors we disrupted preproenkephalin (Penk) in DRN using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in Penk-Cre mice. We found that CRISPR mediated knockdown of enkephalin peptide in the DRN (DRNPenk) enhanced inflammation-induced mechanical sensitivity and odor avoidance. Additionally, loss of DRNPenk diminished sucrose preference and engagement with a novel social stimulus. To further characterize the opioid system within the DRN, we performed Hiplex in situ hybridization of 12 genes in the same tissue. This revealed that DRNPenk is largely separate from DRN serotonin cells and is instead distributed on glutamatergic and GABAergic cells. However, subtype-specific knockdown of DRNPenk from glutamatergic and GABAergic cells did not replicate the behavioral effects of general DRNPenk knockdown. This suggests that these neurons represent a novel population that mediate motivated behaviors distinctly from canonical DRN mechanisms.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

In this study, we performed a comprehensive comparison of the adult immune systems and microbiomes of C57BL/6 laboratory mice exposed to different housing and microbial conditions. C57/Bl6 mice housed in a facility of substandard health levels (herein termed dirty) and C57BL/6 mice born after embryo transfer from females captured in the field (wildings) were compared to C57BL/6 mice housed under standard SPF laboratory conditions. Microbiota and parasite burden varied widely between the three conditions, which also showed marked differences among populations of mature, antigen-experienced, memory, plasma, and germinal centre B cells. Interestingly, we observed discrepancies among T cell phenotypes, with antigen-experienced T cells present at higher frequencies in dirty mice. On the other hand, wildlings displayed significantly elevated frequencies of both naive and antigen-experienced spleen T cells. Interestingly, dirty and wildlings showed differences in the expansion of distinct myeloid cell types. Lastly, we observed that systemic immune traits reverted to a cleaner profile in the progenies (F2) of wildlings raised under laboratory conditions, indicating that such mice may not be suitable for human immune system modelling after prolonged housing in laboratory environments. Collectively, our results highlight the profound effects of varied microbial exposures and husbandry conditions on adult immunity of the common C57BL/6 laboratory mouse and suggest that complex microbial exposure in laboratory mice can provide a relevant tool for modelling immunological functions, thus enhancing their translational value.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluated in the hamster model the immunogenicity, breadth of immunity, and durability of protection elicited by co-administration of two live-attenuated bovine/human parainfluenza virus type 3 (B/HPIV3) vectors expressing antigenically distinct prefusion stabilized S proteins of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 isolate (B/HPIV3/S-6P) or the Omicron/BA.5 variant (B/HPIV3/S-BA.5-2P). These vectors are being developed as bivalent pediatric vaccines against HPIV3 and SARS-CoV-2 and are based on bovine PIV3 with the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoproteins replaced by those of human PIV3. To broaden the S-specific antibody response, we evaluated co-administration of these B/HPIV3 S-expressing vectors. Each B/HPIV3 S-expressing vector induced robust serum anti-S IgG and IgA antibody levels to the antigen-matched S protein that were sustained for at least five months. Co-administration increased the breadth of the S-specific antibody response, spanning the antigenic breadths of the response elicited by each B/HPIV3 S-expressing vector individually. Animals that had received the mixture of vectors developed neutralizing antibodies to ancestral as well as recently circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. Hamsters immunized intranasally were protected against Omicron/BA.5 challenge 5 months after immunization, with no weight loss, SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus replication, or increase in host inflammatory cytokines in the upper and lower airways detectable after the challenge, indicating durable protection. Thus, intranasal co-administration of live-attenuated B/HPIV3 expressing antigenically distinct S proteins induced broad and durable antibody responses and long-term protection against Omicron/BA.5 challenge.

K.; Kim, J.; Schmidt, B. F.; Deitcher, D. L.; Levitan, E.", "abstract": "Synaptic neuropeptide release by Drosophila sLNv clock neurons controls circadian behaviors and sleep. Strikingly, neuropeptide content in sLNv terminals is itself rhythmic with late-night accumulation occurring post-translationally in preparation for midmorning exocytosis of neuropeptide-containing dense-core vesicles (DCVs). Here, live imaging in the brain identifies the mechanism for the daily surge in sLNv presynaptic neuropeptide content. First, consistent with vesicle circulation, sLNv DCVs labeled during synaptic kiss and run exocytosis via a fluorogen-activating protein (FAP) undergo bidirectional transport. Second, anterograde transport to terminals is constant throughout the day. This shows the daily increase in presynaptic neuropeptide content is not produced by a greater supply of DCVs from the soma. Rather, the daily boost in neuropeptide content is accompanied by decreased retrograde axonal DCV transport, which is indicative of increased capture from circulating DCVs. Third, this capture occurs late at night before the daily increase in Ca2+ spike activity at nerve terminals and is independent of concurrent IP3 signaling and axon arbor plasticity. Finally, a per gene mutation implicates the circadian clock in rhythmic DCV capture. Thus, clock-dependent capture of circulating DCVs promotes the subsequent daily burst of peptidergic synaptic transmission by sLNv clock neurons.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

A unique group of viruses, bacteriophages, have regained popularity in research partly due to the rising number of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Phages could potentially replace antibiotics, but only if we understand every detail of their structure and infection cycle. T7 bacteriophages are a group of dsDNA viruses, which infect E. coli bacteria. T7 virions are comprised of an icosahedral protein shell which encapsulates the genomic DNA, and a tail-fiber complex which is primarily used for target recognition and DNA injection. The virus has six L-shaped, ~40 nm long fibers (gp17 protein trimers) attached to the tail-tube, which are thought to be essential for initial host recognition and possibly surface exploration. Using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) we observed the molecular structure and movements of isolated tail fibers. Firstly, we have identified a hinge region within the fibers, which makes them highly flexible, allowing the bending of their distal region. Furthermore, we have observed the dynamic triple helical coiled coil structure of the proximal region, which would allow fiber rotation. These two points of flexibility allow a more efficient and highly dynamic host recognition and virus anchoring process. The observed flexibility might allow host surface exploration by walking.

Excess LB1 in neurons halted migration without altering laminar identity or overall gene expressions in vivo, while in vitro, it elevated nuclear stiffness and impaired neuronal motility in confined spaces. Moreover, mispositioned neurons resulted in electrophysiological defects in the brain. Computational modeling predicted a temporal relationship between nuclear deformation and enhanced migration velocity, which was validated experimentally through live imaging.

Participants showed substantial variability in how much their speech slowed under DAF, quantified by a continuous susceptibility index (SI). At the group level, DAF elicited increased activation in a right-lateralized speech motor network encompassing the superior temporal, supramarginal, inferior frontal, precentral, and supplementary motor areas, along with engagement of the left cerebellum. In contrast, individual differences revealed the opposite pattern: higher susceptibility was associated with stronger activation in left-hemisphere speech motor homologues. Diffusion analyses of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) further showed that greater fiber density in the right posterior AF predicted lower susceptibility, whereas larger right long AF volume predicted higher susceptibility. Together, these findings identify a lateralized and tract-specific organization of speech monitoring: fluency under perturbation depends on a right-lateralized monitoring network that supports integration of auditory and somatosensory feedback through the right posterior AF, while stronger auditory-motor coupling via the right long AF and excessive left-hemisphere activation predict greater vulnerability to feedback disruption.", "date": "2025-10-22", "journal": ""}

Behavioural evidence showed improved performance across trials, including subjects showing an increasing disregard for low-value states. MEG data captured evolving value estimation signals such that, across trials, there was an emergence of stronger and earlier within trial value encoding linked to boosted vmPFC activity. Value encoding signals showed a positive correlation and individual performance metrics, as reflected in overall task-related reward earnings.
