However, odorants of particular ecological role for the fly are encoded through activation of a single specialized olfactory pathway. Comparative analyses of densely reconstructed connectomes of one broadly tuned glomerulus (DL5) and one narrowly tuned glomerulus (DA2) gained detailed insight into the variations of synaptic circuitries of glomeruli with different computational tasks. Our approach combined laser-branding of glomeruli of interest with volume based focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to enable precise targeting and analysis of the two glomeruli. We discovered differences in their neuronal innervation, synaptic composition and specific circuit diagrams of their major cell types: olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) and multiglomerular neurons (MGNs). By comparing our data with a previously mapped narrowly tuned glomerulus (VA1v), we identified putative generic features of narrowly tuned glomerular circuits, including higher density of neuronal fibers and synapses, lower degree of OSN lateralization, stronger axo-axonic connections between OSNs, dendro-dendritic connections between many uPNs, and lower degree of presynaptic input on OSN axons. In addition, this work revealed that the dendrites of the single uPN in DL5 contain a substantial amount of autapses interconnecting distant regions of the dendritic tree. The comparative analysis of glomeruli allows to formulate synaptic motifs implemented in olfactory circuits with different computational demands.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

This study highlights the role of the FtsZ-associated protein (Zap) ZapD in the assembly and stabilization of Z-ring-like structures via filament crosslinking. Using cryo-electron tomography and biochemical analysis, we show that, at equimolar concentrations of ZapD and FtsZ, ZapD induces the formation of toroidal structures composed of short, curved FtsZ filaments that are crosslinked vertically, but also laterally and diagonally. At higher concentrations of ZapD, regularly spaced ZapD dimers crosslink FtsZ filaments from above, resulting in the formation of straight bundles. Despite the simplicity of this reconstituted system, these findings provide valuable insights into the structural organization and stabilization of the Z ring by Zap proteins in bacterial cells, revealing the key role of optimal crosslinking density and geometry in enabling filament curvature and ring formation.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Weakly electric ghost knifefish rely on a distributed array of electroreceptors to detect spatially diffuse electric signals from conspecifics. While we know that spatial resolution for small objects, such as prey, is enhanced near the head due to a high receptor density, it is not clear how receptor organization influences the processing of global and diffuse signals from conspecifics. Using spatially realistic modeling, we quantified how receptor density influences detection and localization accuracy for conspecific signals across varying distances.\n\nOur main result demonstrates that receptor density markedly enhances detection accuracy in frontal regions at intermediate distances (35-50 cm) yet surprisingly contributes minimally to improving localization accuracy. This highlights a fundamental principle: receptor convergence primarily benefits signal detection when dealing with spatially diffuse stimuli, even though higher receptor density can enhance localization accuracy for spatially delineated signals. Our findings extend beyond the electrosensory modality, drawing parallels with other sensory systems, and offer broader insights into spatial processing principles.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

The target genes involved in adaptation through CNV in tomato and its wild relatives remain unexplored at the population level. Therefore, we characterized the CNV landscape of Solanum chilense, a wild tomato species adapted to dry habitats, using whole-genome short-read data of 35 individuals from seven populations. We identified 212,207 CNVs, including 160,926 deletions and 51,281 duplications. We found a higher number of CNVs in diverging populations occupying stressful habitats. CNVs and single nucleotide polymorphisms analyses concordantly revealed the known species population structure, underscoring the impact of historical demographic and recent colonization events shaping genome-wide CNVs. Furthermore, we identified 3,539 candidate genes with highly divergent CNV profiles across populations. Interestingly, these genes are functionally associated with response to abiotic stress and linked to multiple pathways of flowering time regulation. Gene CNVs in S. chilense exhibit two evolutionary trends: gene loss in ancestral lineages distributed in central and southern coast populations and gene gain in the most recent diverged lineage from the southern highland region. Environmental association of the CNVs ultimately linked the dynamics of gene copy number to six climatic variables. It suggests that natural selection has likely shaped CNV patterns in stress-response genes promoting the colonization of contrasting habitats.

While it is established that DNA methylation hinders CTCF binding, the impacts of this methylation-sensitive CTCF binding on chromatin architecture and transcription are poorly defined. Here, we used a selective DNMT1 inhibitor (DNMT1i) to investigate the characteristics and functions of  DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks resulting from global DNA demethylation. We found that DNMT1i-specific peaks preferentially form chromatin loops on gene bodies and interact with highly-looping partner peaks located in regions of active chromatin. Notably, both DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly-looping partners are enriched near nuclear speckles, condensate bodies implicated in transcription and splicing. Utilizing targeted protein degradation, we specifically depleted CTCF and nuclear speckles to elucidate their functional interplay. By degrading CTCF upon DNMT1 inhibition, we revealed that CTCF is important for DNMT1i-dependent interactions between chromatin and speckle proteins. Moreover, we found that CTCF promotes the activation of genes near speckles upon DNMT1 inhibition. Conversely, acute depletion of nuclear speckles revealed that they influence RNA abundance but do not maintain CTCF binding or looping. Collectively, our study suggests a model wherein DNA methylation prevents spurious CTCF occupancy and interactions with regulatory elements near nuclear speckles, yet CTCF looping is robust towards the loss of speckles.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we found that I{kappa}B accumulates specifically in the chromatin fraction of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. I{kappa}B depletion does not affect NF-kB-dependent transcription, but causes a profound epigenetic rewiring in pluripotent stem cells, including alterations in H3K27me3, a histone mark catalyzed by Polycomb repression complex 2. Chromatin changes induced by I{kappa}B depletion affect a subset of pluripotency genes and are associated with altered gene transcription. At the cellular level, I{kappa}B-deficient embryonic stem cells are arrested in a naive pluripotency state when cultured in serum/LIF conditions and fail to exit pluripotency under differentiation conditions. By constructing separation-of-function mutants, we show that the effects of I{kappa}B in regulating stem cell pluripotency are NF-{kappa}B-independent, but mainly rely on its chromatin-related function.

We employed inducible Cre (iCre) mouse models to target specific cell populations including c-kitCreERT2 to target interstitial cells of Cajal like cells; Pdgfr{beta}CreERT2 to target pericyte-like cells; PdgfrCreERTM to target CD34+ adventitial cells; and Myh11CreERT2 to target lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) directly.

Further, optogenetic depolarization with ChR2 only induced propagated contractions in LMCs.

While advances in machine learning techniques hold great potential to fill this annotation gap, current methods for function prediction are unable to associate global function reliably to the specific residues responsible for that function. We address this issue by introducing PARSE (Protein Annotation by Residue-Specific Enrichment), a knowledge-based method which combines pre-trained embeddings of local structural environments with traditional statistical techniques to simultaneously predict function and provide residue-level annotations. For the task of predicting the catalytic function of enzymes, PARSE achieves comparable or superior global performance to state-of-the-art machine learning methods (F1 score > 85%) while simultaneously annotating the specific residues involved in each function with much greater precision. Since it does not require supervised training, our method can make one-shot predictions for very rare functions and is not limited to a particular type of functional label (e.g. Enzyme Commission numbers or Gene Ontology codes). Finally, we leverage the AlphaFold Structure Database to perform functional annotation at a proteome scale. By applying PARSE to the dark proteome--predicted structures which cannot be classified into known structural families--we predict several novel bacterial metalloproteases. Each of these proteins shares a strongly conserved catalytic site despite highly divergent sequences and global folds, illustrating the value of local structure representations for new function discovery.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

A.; Mandell, J. D.; Jackson, M.; Fisk, N.; Cannataro, V. L.; Townsend, J. P.", "abstract": "Background Somatic mutations commonly accumulate in histologically normal tissues and contribute to cancer development. However, many somatic variants found at high frequencies in normal tissues are also found at high frequencies in cancers arising from the same tissue types. Consequently, the roles of these variants in cancer development remain poorly understood. To address this, we assessed the selective pressures across steps of tumorigenesis, as well as epistasis between driver mutations. Methods We employed evolutionary modeling to quantify the strength of selection on somatic variants across two key steps of esophageal development: from organogenesis to clonal histologically normal epithelium, and from there to esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. Analyzing sequence data from 2171 samples, our first-of-its kind model revealed the stepwise contributions of somatic mutations to increased cellular division and survival and their pairwise epistatic effects on driver mutation selection. Results NOTCH1 substitutions were strongly selected along the step from organogenesis to clonal histologically normal esophageal tissue, explaining their high prevalence in samples of this tissue. However, for the first time, we show that there is little to no positive selection for NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and FAT1 mutations during progression from clonal histologically normal esophageal tissue to esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma in humans, leading to a conclusion that these substitutions promote clonal growth in normal tissue, but do not drive tumorigenesis from extant clonal tissue growths. Moreover, we provide a somatic genetic basis for this differential role: we demonstrate for the first time that mutations in NOTCH1 exhibit antagonistic epistasis with mutations of well-known tumor suppressor genes TP53 and RB1, reducing selection for these progressive mutations in tumorigenesis. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that early positively selected mutations in NOTCH1 and other genes can shape evolutionary trajectories in ways that ultimately constrain malignant progression. Quantification of step-specific selection and identification of antagonistic epistatic interactions with key tumor suppressors reveals that somatic evolution is often context-dependent--what promotes clonal expansion in normal tissue may later impede growth or survival in tumors. These insights underscore the need for precision strategies that account for the shifting fitness landscape across premalignant and malignant stages, informing early detection, prevention, and therapeutic prioritization.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Studying biobehavioral mechanisms in the species most closely related to humans can provide insights into the origins of human communication, and the impact of genetic variation on complex behavioral phenotypes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that similar genetic factors underlie social communication differences in both bonobos (Pan paniscus) and humans. We analyzed Sanger sequencing results to determine if bonobos exhibit individual variation at 10 loci across FOXP2, OXTR, and AVPR1A that have been implicated in human social development and behavior. We identified a novel variant in bonobo FOXP2, as well as three novel variants in bonobo OXTR that were 19-184 base pairs away from the target human SNPs. We also found a linked SNP combination (TGA) across the 3 novel bonobo OXTR sites at high frequency (65%) in the study population, including 6 homozygous bonobos. When comparing the combined OXTR genotypes, we found significant group differences in social behavior; bonobos with two copies of the TGA combination were more social than bonobos with one copy and bonobos with zero copies of the TGA combination.

We observed that human proteins that are part of the SARS-CoV2-human association are enriched in hubs and bottlenecks. Again, these proteins take part in more protein complexes and show slower evolutionary rates compared to the human proteins associated with the two other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Moreover, the human proteins involved in the interaction with SARS-CoV2 are mostly longer proteins harboring long intrinsically disordered stretches and a higher level of disordered protein binding sites. Codon usage analysis revealed that the novel coronavirus is least adapted to codons used in housekeeping and lung-specific genes, compared to the other two coronaviruses. We conclude that the signatures showed by the SARS-CoV2-human protein interaction network revealed the viruss association with vital human proteins and pathways, via interactions mediated by protein complexes and intrinsically disordered protein binding sites, which may have assisted the higher infectivity of SARS-CoV2 in its human host than the other two less-virulent human coronaviruses, despite having a lower optimization to its hosts codons.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Our objective is thus to finally decipher the regulatory causes of gene expression plasticity, using both theoretical predictions from a simulated network evolution model and the empirical data of Escherichia coli regulatory network. We investigated the link between network topology and gene expression at three levels: the number of regulators, the number and the proportion of loops (feedback loops, feedforward loops and diamond loops), and the proportion of unique motifs (here characterized by the position of up- or down-regulations within loops). Consistent results from our empirical and theoretical approaches revealed that plastic genes were regulated by more genes on average.

Nicotine binds and activates two astrocyte-expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), 4{beta}2 and 7. Protein kinase B-{beta} (Pkb-{beta} or Akt2) expression is restricted to astrocytes in mice and humans and is activated by nicotine. To determine if AKT2 plays a role in astrocytic nicotinic responses, we generated astrocyte-specific Akt2 conditional knockout (cKO) and full Akt2 KO mice. For in/ex vivo studies, we examined mice exposed to chronic nicotine for two weeks in drinking water (200 g/mL) or following acute nicotine challenge (0.09, 0.2 mg/kg) after 24 hrs. Our in vitro studies used cultured mouse astrocytes to measure nicotine-dependent astrocytic responses. Sholl analysis was used to measure glial fibrillary acidic protein responses in astrocytes. Our data show that wild-type (WT) mice exhibit increased astrocyte morphological complexity during acute nicotine exposure, with decreasing complexity during chronic nicotine use, whereas Akt2 cKO mice showed enhanced acute responses and reduced area following chronic exposure. In culture, we found that 100M nicotine was sufficient for morphological changes and blocking 7 or 4{beta}2 nAChRs prevented observed morphologic changes. We performed conditioned place preference (CPP) in Akt2 cKO mice which revealed reduced nicotine preference in cKO mice compared to controls. Finally, we performed RNASeq experiments comparing nicotine- and LPS-mediated gene expression identifying robust differences between these two astrocytic stimuli. These findings show the importance of nAChRs and AKT2 signaling in the astrocytic response to nicotine.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular integration between the physical properties of the microenvironment and dynamic intracellular signaling responses remains unclear. Here, we identify a mechanistic link between ECM stiffness and pHi dynamics in driving vasculogenic mimicry (VM), an aggressive cancer phenotype associated with poor prognosis. We performed single-cell imaging of pHi in lung and breast metastatic cell lines cultured on tunable-stiffness hydrogel systems. We used two tunable-stiffness hydrogel systems to independently model stiffness induced by increased protein secretion (Matrigel) and increased protein crosslinking (Hyaluronic acid gels). We show that increased ECM stiffness lowers single-cell pHi in both lung and breast metastatic cell lines. We also observed that stiff ECM promotes a distinct morphological phenotype called vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Importantly, we show that low pHi is a necessary mediator of VM, as raising pHi on stiff ECM reduces VM phenotypes. We also find that lowering pHi on soft ECM was sufficient to induce VM in the absence of extracellular stiffening. We characterized {beta}-catenin as a pH-dependent molecular mediator of VM, where stiffness-driven increases in {beta}-catenin abundance can be overridden by high pHi, which destabilizes {beta}-catenin to reduce VM on stiff ECM. In contrast, the transcription factor FOXC2 is activated by ECM stiffness but is insensitive to pHi, and its activity alone is insufficient to maintain VM at high pHi when {beta}-catenin is lost. We uncover a novel mechanotransduction axis in which ECM stiffness regulates intracellular pH to drive {beta}-catenin-induced VM. We also show pHi dynamics can override mechanosensitive cell responses to the extracellular microenvironment. Thus, our work positions pHi as an integrator of mechanotransduction in cancer, suggesting a new framework for therapeutically targeting pHi in cancer and perhaps in other diseases driven by ECM remodeling.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

This study aims to compare two techniques used to estimate trFNC, to investigate their similarities and differences when applied to fMRI data. These techniques are the sliding window Pearson correlation (SWPC), an amplitude-based approach, and phase synchronization (PS), a phase-based technique. To accomplish our objective, we used resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) with 827 subjects (repetition time: 0.7s) and the Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (fBIRN) with 311 subjects (repetition time: 2s), which included 151 schizophrenia patients and 160 controls. Our simulations reveal distinct strengths in two connectivity methods: SWPC captures high-magnitude, low-frequency connectivity, while PS detects low-magnitude, high-frequency connectivity. Stronger correlations between SWPC and PS align with pronounced fMRI oscillations. For fMRI data, higher correlations between SWPC and PS occur with matched frequencies and smaller SWPC window sizes ([~]30s), but larger windows ([~]88s) sacrifice clinically relevant information. Both methods identify a schizophrenia-associated brain network state but show different patterns: SWPC highlights low anti-correlations between visual, subcortical, auditory, and sensory-motor networks, while PS shows reduced positive synchronization among these networks. In sum, our findings underscore the complementary nature of SWPC and PS, elucidating their respective strengths and limitations without implying the superiority of one over the other.\n\nImpact StatementThis study demonstrates that SWPC and PS provide complementary insights into dynamic functional connectivity, revealing different aspects of brain dynamics based on signal focus. For tasks involving slow dynamics, SWPC amplitude is ideal, while the PS phase is more suitable for transient dynamics. In schizophrenia, typically associated with general dysconnectivity, we uncover a dual dysconnectivity profile depending on phase or amplitude dynamics. This novel approach offers researchers a platform to explore task-specific dysconnectivity profiles, enabling more targeted interventions. These findings will guide methodology choices, deepen understanding of brain dynamics, and support the development of precise neuropsychiatric biomarkers.\n\nHighlightsO_LITime-resolved functional network connectivity (trFNC) is widely used; here we study two approaches often pit against one another: 1) phase synchrony (PS), a phase-based method, and 2) sliding window Pearson correlation (SWPC), an amplitude-based method.\nC_LIO_LISWPC is sensitive to the choice of window size, while PS requires a narrow frequency band.

This poses a critical challenge: How does the olfactory system maintain stable representations of odors and therefore allow for stable sensory perceptions amidst this ongoing circuit instability? Utilizing a detailed spiking network model of early olfactory circuits, we uncovered dual roles for adult-neurogenesis: one that both supports representational stability to faithfully encode odor information and also one that facilitates plasticity to allow for learning and adaptation. In the main olfactory bulb, adult-neurogenesis affects neural codes in individual mitral and tufted cells but preserves odor representations at the neuronal population level. By contrast, in the olfactory piriform cortex, both individual cell responses and overall population dynamics undergo progressive changes due to adult-neurogenesis. This leads to representational drift, a gradual alteration in sensory perception. Both processes are dynamic and depend on experience such that repeated exposure to specific odors reduces the drift due to adult-neurogenesis; thus, when the odor environment is stable over the course of adult-neurogenesis, it is neurogenesis that actually allows the representations to remain stable in piriform cortex; when those olfactory environments change, adult-neurogenesis allows the cortical representations to track environmental change. Whereas perceptual stability and plasticity due to learning are often thought of as two distinct, often contradictory processing in neuronal coding, we find that adult-neurogenesis serves as a shared mechanism for both. In this regard, adult-neurogenesis in the mammalian olfactory bulb that has been the focus of considerable study in chemosensory neuroscience may be the mechanistic underpinning behind an array of complex computations.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Notably, P118 and its supernatant exhibited great antibacterial activities and attenuated C. elegans susceptibility to Salmonella infection. We found that P118 protected mice against Salmonella lethal infections by enhancing colonization resistance, reducing pathogen invasion, alleviating intestinal pro-inflammatory response, and improving microbial dysbiosis and fecal metabolite changes. Microbiota and fecal metabolome analyses suggested P118 administration significantly decreased the relative abundances of potentially harmful microbes (e.g., Salmonella, Anaeroplasma, Klebsiella) and increased the fecal levels of tryptophan and its derivatives (indole, indole-3-acrylic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-methoxyindoleacetate). Deterministic processes determined the gut microbial community assembly of P118-pretreated mice.

However, recent discoveries have revealed that a significant burden of disease heritability in common autoinflammatory disorders and coronary artery disease (CAD) is mediated through genetic variation modifying post-transcriptional modification of RNA through adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. This common RNA modification is catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, where ADAR1 edits specific immunogenic double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to prevent activation of the double strand RNA (dsRNA) sensor MDA5 (IFIH1) and stimulation of an interferon stimulated gene (ISG) response. Multiple lines of human genetic data indicate impaired RNA editing and increased dsRNA sensing by MDA5 to be an important mechanism of CAD risk. Here, we provide a crucial link between observations in human genetics and mechanistic cell biology leading to progression of CAD. Through analysis of human atherosclerotic plaque and culture of human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) we implicate the SMC to have a distinct requirement for RNA editing, and that MDA5 activation regulates SMC phenotypic modulation. Through generation of a conditional SMC specific Adar1 deletion mouse model on a pro-atherosclerosis background with additional constitutive deletion of MDA5 (Ifih1), and with incorporation of single cell RNA sequencing cellular profiling, we further show that Adar1 controls SMC phenotypic state by regulating Mda5 activation, is required to maintain vascular integrity, and controls progression of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. Finally, we further corroborate our findings in a large human carotid endarterectomy dataset (Athero-Express) where we show that ISG activation is strongly associated with decreased plaque stability, increased SMC phenotypic modulation, and increased plaque calcification. Through this work, we describe a fundamental mechanism of CAD, where cell type and context specific RNA editing and sensing of dsRNA mediates disease progression, bridging our understanding of human genetics and disease causality.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySmooth muscle expression of RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 regulates activation of double strand RNA sensor MDA5 in novel mechanism of atherosclerosis.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we use the UK Biobank to measure the change in PGS prediction accuracy as a continuous function of individuals genome-wide genetic dissimilarity to the GWAS sample (\"genetic distance\"). Our results highlight three gaps in our understanding of PGS portability. First, prediction accuracy is extremely noisy at the individual level and not well predicted by genetic distance. In fact, variance in prediction accuracy is explained comparably well by socioeconomic measures. Second, trends of portability vary across traits. For several immunity-related traits, prediction accuracy drops near zero quickly even at intermediate levels of genetic distance. This quick drop may reflect GWAS associations being more ancestry-specific in immunity-related traits than in other traits. Third, we show that even qualitative trends of portability can depend on the measure of prediction accuracy used. For instance, for type 2 diabetes, precision stays roughly constant, while recall surprisingly increases, with genetic distance. Together, our results show that portability cannot be understood through global ancestry groupings alone. There are other, understudied factors influencing portability, such as the specifics of the evolution of the trait and its genetic architecture, social context, and the construction of the polygenic score. Addressing these gaps can aid in the development and application of PGS and inform more equitable genomic research.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

However, the rate at which microbial genomes are sequenced has continued to increase, and there are now datasets in the millions, far beyond the abilities of existing alignment tools. We introduce LexicMap, a nucleotide sequence alignment tool for efficiently querying moderate length sequences (>250 bp) such as a gene, plasmid or long read against up to millions of prokaryotic genomes. A key innovation is to construct a small set of probe k-mers (e.g. n = 20,000) which are selected to efficiently sample the entire database to be indexed, such that every 250 bp window of each database genome contains multiple seed k-mers each with a shared prefix with one of the probes. Storing these seeds in a hierarchical index enables fast and low-memory alignment. We benchmark both accuracy as the query diverges from the match in the database, and potential to scale to databases of millions of bacterial genomes, showing that LexicMap achieves comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art, but with greater speed and lower memory use. We then benchmark LexicMap on small/diverse (GTDB) and large/redundant (AllTheBacteria and GenBank+RefSeq) databases. Alignment of a single gene against 2.34 million prokaryotic genomes from GenBank and RefSeq takes 3 (rare gene) to 33 (16S rRNA gene) minutes.

We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which are translated into a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. Using a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first passage through dendrites, we connect the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases--- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma--- to the characteristics of the evolving signal.

We previously reported that magnesium sequestration by Candida albicans enables Pseudomonas aeruginosa to become colistin-resistant. Here, we show that magnesium depletion drives P. aeruginosa to evolve greater colistin resistance through genetic changes in lipid A biosynthesis-modification pathways and a putative magnesium transporter. These mutations synergize with the magnesium-sensing PhoPQ two-component signaling system to remodel lipid A structures of the bacterial outer membrane in previously uncharacterized ways. One predominant mutational pathway relies on early mutations in htrB2, a non-essential gene involved in lipid A biosynthesis, which enhances resistance but compromises outer membrane integrity, resulting in fitness costs and increased susceptibility to other antibiotics. A second pathway achieves increased colistin resistance independently of htrB2 mutations without compromising membrane integrity. In both cases, reduced binding of colistin to the bacterial membrane underlies resistance.

Among those, two mAbs, P5B3 and P3D6, that bind to the injectisome tip protein PcrV, exhibited T3SS blocking activity. We solved the crystal structure of the P3D6 Fab-PcrV complex, which revealed that the Ab binds to the C-terminal region of PcrV. In addition, we compared the T3SS-blocking activity of three PcrV-targeting mAbs, including two from previous independent studies, using two distinct assays to evaluate pore formation and toxin injection. We conducted a mechanistic and structural analysis of their modes of action through modeling based on the known structure of a functional homolog, SipD from Salmonella typhimurium. The analysis suggests that anti-PcrV mAbs may act through different mechanisms, ranging from preventing PcrV oligomerization to disrupting PcrVs scaffolding function, thereby inhibiting the assembly and function of the translocon pore. Our findings provide additional evidence that T3SS-targeting Abs, some capable of inhibiting virulence, are elicited in P. aeruginosa-infected patients. The results offer deeper insights into PcrV recognition by mAbs and their associated mechanisms of action, helping to identify which Abs are more likely to be therapeutically useful based on their mode of action and potency.

The HMM framework allows to compute the full likelihood of the data, while accounting both for the stochastic evolution of population allele frequencies along time and for the noise arising from sampling a limited number of individuals at possibly spread out generations. Several such HMM methods have been proposed so far, differing mainly in the way they model the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. Following Paris et al.

To facilitate the analysis and exploitation of genomic time series data, we present an improved version of Paris et al. (2019) approach, denoted SelNeTime, whose computation time is drastically reduced and which accurately estimates effective population size (assuming no selection) or the selection intensity at each locus (given a previously estimated value of N). This method is implemented in a user friendly python package, which also allows to easily simulate genomic time series data under a user-defined evolutionary model and sampling design.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Accurate neuron segmentation from microscopy volumes is essential for automating connectome reconstruction. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms use image-based convolutional neural networks that are limited to local neuron shape context. Thus, we introduce a new framework that reasons over global neuron shape with a novel point affinity transformer. Our framework embeds a (multi-)neuron point cloud into a fixed-length feature set from which we can decode any point pair affinities, enabling clustering neuron point clouds for automatic proofreading. We also show that the learned feature set can easily be mapped to a contrastive embedding space that enables neuron type classification using a simple KNN classifier. Our approach excels in two demanding connectomics tasks: proofreading segmentation errors and classifying neuron types. Evaluated on three benchmark datasets derived from state-of-the-art connectomes, our method outperforms point transformers, graph neural networks, and unsupervised clustering baselines.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

For stability-based selection to be efficient, the range of pairing stabilities must be narrowed by raising the lower bound and lowering the upper bound. The constrained structure and intramolecular cooperativity of tRNA complicate understanding of how it modulates codon-anticodon stability and whether it affects selection kinetics beyond codon recognition. To address these questions, we engineered functional split-tRNAs bearing a dangling anticodon in place of the anticodon loop. Our results demonstrate that split-tRNA supports in vitro translation nearly as efficiently as intact synthetic tRNA, challenging the notion that tRNA strain is essential for triggering GTP hydrolysis in response to codon recognition. Using split-tRNA architecture, we found that codon-anticodon stability is likely modulated by the dipole moments of adjacent nucleobases. Our kinetic modeling aligns with a conformational selection mechanism, where the decoding site fluctuates between open and closed states, and the correct codon-anticodon minihelix acts as an allosteric effector that permits its spontaneous closure and stabilizes the closed state. Overall, our data challenge the notion that tRNA is an active player in the selection process.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Using acoustic sampling and field observations, we studied the bird species found in MSF in the Eastern Himalayas. Our results show differential vocal activity patterns among MSF-forming bird species and suggest a positive correlation between calling rates and closeness centrality (species importance in a flock) in understory MSFs. We also found a more synchronised vocalisation pattern in the understory MSFs, with a consistent peak in vocal activity in the early morning hours, whereas no consistent vocal pattern was found for canopy flocks.

R.", "abstract": "Although division of labor as a means to increase productivity is a common feature in animal social groups, most previous studies have focused almost exclusively on eusocial insects with extreme task partitioning. Empirical evidence of division of labor in vertebrates is scarce, largely because we lack a theoretical framework to explore the conditions under which division of labor is likely to evolve in cooperatively breeding systems where helpers remain capable of breeding throughout their lifetime. By explicitly considering alternative helping tasks with varying fitness costs, we model how individual decisions on task specialization may influence the emergence of division of labor under both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Surprisingly, we find that direct survival benefits of living in larger groups are the primary force driving the evolution of cooperation to enhance group productivity, and that indirect fitness benefits derived from related group members are only a non-essential facilitator of more stable forms of division of labor in cooperative breeders. In addition, we find that division of labor in vertebrates is favored by harsh environments. Ultimately, our model not only makes key predictions that are consistent with existing empirical data, but also proposes novel avenues for new empirical work in vertebrate and invertebrate systems alike.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

These nerves can have physiological activity that interacts with the activity evoked by electrical stimulation, potentially influencing targeted neural output and clinical outcomes. Our goal was to quantify changes in sensory neural unit activity in response to variations in electrical stimulation frequency and amplitude. In a feline model, we applied cutaneous brushing to evoke pudendal nerve afferent activity with and without electrical stimulation via a pudendal nerve cuff electrode. We recorded neural output with microelectrode arrays implanted in ipsilateral sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Combined inter-spike interval distributions for all DRG units showed ranges of flattening, increases, and shifts in response to electrical stimulation. These distributions and changes within them due to electrical stimulation were largely driven by a select few units. Mixed-effects models revealed that quicker firing units generally decreased in firing rate in response to electrical stimulation and, conversely, slower firing units increased in firing rate. A unit's underlying firing rate also drove the magnitude of change in mean output firing rate in response to stimulation. Further, the models reported a small, negative correlation between the output mean unit firing rate and the applied electrical stimulation frequency. These results demonstrate the potential impact of electrical stimulation on underlying neural firing activity and output. Peripheral neuromodulation may normalize abnormal firing patterns in nerves contributing to pathological disorders or alter unrelated physiological activity in off-target neurons.

HPMCs retain their genome in culture, but many endogenous circulating factors are not present in the in vitro environment, or at concentrations that do not mirror physiological levels. To address the assumption that HPMCs are valid models of age and sex-specificity in human muscle research, we examined to what extent HPMC lines retain their source phenotype in culture. Methods: Biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle were collected from ten males aged 18-30, ten females aged 18-30 and ten males aged 60-75 recruited from a general, healthy population. A portion of the muscle was used for the establishment of 30 individual HMPC lines. The remaining sample was immediately snap frozen and stored for further analysis. RNA was extracted from muscle tissue samples and their corresponding, fully differentiated HMPCs and analysed using RNA Sequencing. To compare their transcriptomic signature, principal component analysis (PCA), differential expression analysis, single-cell deconvolution and pathway enrichment analysis were conducted in R. Results: A comparison of the transcriptomic signature of 30 human muscle biopsies and their corresponding HPMCs indicated a near-complete lack of retention of the genes and pathways differentially regulated in vivo when compared to their in vitro equivalent, with the exception of several genes encoded on the Y-chromosome. Conclusions: The diversity of resident cell populations in muscle tissue and the lack of sex- and age-dependent circulating factors in the cellular milieu likely contribute to these observations, which call for caution when using HPMCs as an experimental model of human muscle sex or age.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Phenological associations between deciduous trees, phytophagous insects and their consumers (e.g. passerine birds) have become one of the model systems for understanding this process. However, most existing research reports population-level associations rather than examining the smaller spatial scales at which these trophic interactions occur. Furthermore, a variety of methods have been used to measure phenology, particularly on producers and primary consumers, with little formal comparison. To investigate how different methods of measuring producer and primary consumer phenology influence our understanding of these biological relationships at the appropriate scale, we quantified phenological metrics for individual host trees and the phytophagous insects that depend on them in a deciduous woodland during spring 2023. We sampled 170 trees from six deciduous species in Wytham Woods, UK, deriving nine metrics of phenology from five distinct field methods: multispectral drone imaging (NDVI), hemispherical canopy photography, and bud-scoring observations to track tree phenology, as well as water traps and frass traps to monitor insect herbivore phenology. We assessed the reliability of these methods within both trophic levels and across tree species. We further evaluated the extent to which tree phenology metrics correlated with herbivore phenology, at the level of individual trees, and links to variation in subsequent herbivory rates across a subsample of 72 oak trees (Quercus robur). Our results illustrate how methodological choices can affect our ability to study the timing of trophic interactions and reveal fine-scale spatiotemporal variation in phenology across both trophic levels.

We ran experiments in aquatic microcosms with an increasing number of structural elements (0, 2, or 3 rings of plastic plants in different spatial configurations), resulting in five habitat complexity levels. Across these levels, predators were presented with different prey densities to determine the functional response pattern. The experimental design and analysis allowed us to test for effects of structure presence, amount, and complexity level on functional response in one pass, without confounding predictors.\n\n3. The feeding for both predators across all complexity levels was best described by a type II functional response model, and habitat drove feeding strength. Regarding the latter, the predators showed different responses to the complexity treatments. The overall feeding rate of I. elegans was mainly explained by the absence vs. presence of structure. Yet, in the case of N. glauca, feeding rate was strongly dependent on habitat complexity with the predator showing a unique maximum feeding rate (i.e. the inverse of the handling time) for each complexity level and a decreasing attack rate with increasing amount of habitat.\n\n4. On average, prey consumption by both predators was reduced when complex structures were present, compared to the  no habitat structure environment (e.g. consumption more than halved for some treatments).

TW consists of three legs, each with a ligand-gated DNA-binding domain that enables selective interaction with specific sites along a DNA track11. Using single-molecule fluorescence assays and a programmable microfluidic device, we show that TW steps directionally along a designed DNA track in response to a defined sequence of ligand inputs. We built our TW molecular walker using a modular approach, combining existing proteins with known properties to achieve emergent motor function, similar to how Nature evolves new proteins.

Moreover, overexpressing GATA4 in young chondrocytes remarkably reduced their cartilage-forming capacity in vitro and induced the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines.

In OA mice induced by surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus, intraarticular injection of lentiviral vectors carrying mouse Gata4 resulted in a higher OA severity, synovial inflammation, and pain level when compared to control vectors. Mechanistically, we found that overexpressing GATA4 significantly increased the phosphorylation of SMAD1/5. Our work demonstrates that the aging-associated increase of GATA4 in chondrocytes plays a vital role in OA progression, which may also serve as a target to reduce osteoarthritis in the older population.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared to congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left-hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared to congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

J.; Marcinkiewcz, C.; Fadool, D. A.", "abstract": "The olfactory bulb (OB) contains multiple, parallel projection neurons to relay the nature of a stimulus. In a mouse ex vivo slice preparation, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to measure intrinsic properties, excitability, action potential (AP) shape, voltage-activated conductances, and neuromodulation in the newly-categorized superficial tufted cells (sTCs) compared with those of mitral cells (MCs). We propose that a marked difference in voltage- dependent current represents distinct ion channel populations that affect the kinetics of action potentials, and evokes an increase in sTC firing frequency, albeit both types of projection neurons having similar AP spiking activity. Triple-colored immunofluorescence and RNA scope were used to detect co-localization of the Kv1.3 ion channel and the insulin receptor in sTCs, with [~]73% of sTCs expressing both. The sTCs were modulated by bath application of insulin - increasing AP firing frequency by 97%, attributable to an 8% decrease in the intraburst interval, and a reduction of the latency to first spike by 37%. We conclude that there may be a range of neuromodulators of sTCs that may alter excitability and fine-tune olfactory information processing or metabolic balance.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTSuperficial tufted cells, as output neurons of the olfactory bulb, were electrophysiologically studied to be insulin sensitive.

S.; Sumasgutner, P.; Tschumi, M.; Wikelski, M.; Zimmermann, S.; Safi, K.; Nourani, E.", "abstract": "Many young animals must gain independence from parental care by acquiring the necessary skills for survival. Thus, the rate of skill acquisition can predict how long juveniles remain with their parents before emigrating from the natal territory. Yet in some systems, young animals acquire adult-like skills and the capacity to be independent long before they emigrate. This raises the question of why the timing of emigration decouples from the rate of skill acquisition, resulting in extended parental care. We addressed this by leveraging GPS tracking data from juvenile golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), which learn to fly and to hunt while remaining with their parents for 61-283 days after fledging. Young golden eagles often go on excursions without their parents outside of their natal territories before emigration. We expected flight performance to predict the timing of excursions better than the timing of emigration, which should be more influenced by external factors. In a set of time-to-event models, we predicted the rate of excursions and of emigration using metrics of soaring flight performance or of daily movement. Contrary to our prediction, we found that soaring performance failed to predict the rate of either excursions or emigration, whereas daily movement predicted both rates, but inconsistently. This was likely because those coarser metrics captured motivation and weather in addition to flight skills. Thus external factors seem more likely to explain the timing of independence and internal development--in this case of flight skills--may be completed quickly. Juveniles may delay emigration not due to lack of skill, but because the costs of leaving parental care outweigh the benefits. The difference we discovered between when individuals were capable of independence and when they committed to it may obscure the more general link between skill acquisition and the end of parental care in other systems as well.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Camptothecin and its derivatives are potent inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase I and are widely used for the treatment of lung, cervical, ovarian, and colon cancers. Camptothecin biosynthesis in C. acuminata involves complex catalytic steps, most of which remain undeciphered.

The formation of strictosidinic acid is catalyzed by strictosidine/strictosidine acid syn-thase enzymes (STR) (Fig. 1A). While a biosynthetic route for the conversion of the indole ring to the quinoline ring has been proposed, most of the underlying biosynthetic genes have yet to be identified (Fig. 1A) (Sadre et al. 2016).

These changes, collectively known as sickness syndrome, are orchestrated by the brain in response to immune mediators released during systemic inflammation. While the roles of subcortical regions, including the hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei, in regulating sickness symptoms are well established, the contribution of the neocortex to the encoding and modulation of the sick state remains less well understood. We examined the neuronal correlates of sickness in the neocortex of awake mice following a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a well-characterized mediator of sickness. Behavioral analysis revealed that PGE2 elicited a rapid and robust sickness response, characterized by fever, slower locomotion, quiescence, anorexia, and eye squinting. Whole-brain Fos mapping showed that PGE2 generates a distinct neural activation pattern encompassing much of the interoceptive network. Electrophysiological recordings using Neuropixel probes in awake mice together with dimensionality reduction and decoding analysis revealed that neuronal population dynamics in the insular cortex (IC) and the primary somatosensory cortex (SSp), two regions involved in body state representation, encode sickness-related information, such as body temperature, walking velocity, grooming, and eye squinting. However, unlike SSp, ongoing neuronal activity in IC exhibited a better decoding performance for an integrated measure of sickness rather than individual symptoms. Together, these results suggest that PGE2 induces a coordinated physiological and behavioral response akin to a sick state, which is preferentially encoded in the IC.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

We previously described the somatotopic organization of bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) around the Drosophila head that elicit a sequence of location-aimed grooming movements (Eichler et al., 2024). Here, we use a serial section electron microscopy reconstruction of a full adult fly brain to identify nearly all of BMN pre-and postsynaptic partners, uncovering circuit pathways that control head grooming. Postsynaptic partners dominate the connectome, and are both excitatory and inhibitory. We identified an excitatory hemilineage of cholinergic interneurons (hemilineage 23b) that elicit aimed head grooming and exhibit varied connectivity to BMNs from different head locations, revealing lineage-based development of a somatotopic parallel circuit architecture. Presynaptic partners provide extensive BMN presynaptic inhibition, consistent with models of sensory gain control as a mechanism of suppressing grooming movements and controlling the sequence. This work provides the first comprehensive map of a somatotopically organized connectome, and reveals how this organization could shape grooming.

Among these, 6,203 were tumor-specific expressed and strongly associated with the tumorigenesis. Using these annotations, we created TEITbase (http://teitbase.medbioinfo.org/), a user-friendly database that provides researchers with tools to conduct various downstream analyses and investigations for TE-initiated transcripts, including 546 novel onco-exaptation events. The establishment of TEITbase provides new insights into transcriptional reprogramming in cancers and enables further investigation into the potential roles of TE-initiated transcripts in cancer diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

The genes are parts of essential cellular pathways but are regulated differently in both forms of microcephaly. These genes have diverged from single ancestral genes in to related but different gene paralogues during evolution. It is suggested that the paralogues might be redundant in other body organs and might rescue any abnormality in case of MCPH but not in Seckel syndrome. The study uncovers the spatio-temporal dynamics of these genes together with their paralogues at mRNA level where the different tissues of embryos might exhibit different transcript variants or different levels of the various transcript variants to find the complementation in case of the MCPH but divergence in case of the Seckel syndrome. Here, we studied Cdk5Rap2-Pde4dip, Phc1-Phc3 (for MCPH) and Cep63-Ccdc67 (for Seckel) in the embryonic mice tissues via RT-PCR throughout the peak of neurogenesis from E12.5 to E18.5. We found already known spatio-temporal differential expression. For MCPH, Cdk5Rap2-Pde4dip had similar profiles and seemed to be redundant whereas Phc1-Phc3 seem to have complementary roles in brain development. The expression profiles of Cep63-Ccdc67 were very different indicative of their diverged roles in development.\n\nSummary StatementThe reverse transcription and relative quantitation in spatio-temporal embryonic mice tissues suggest, the paralogues in MCPH (primary microcephaly, PM) can rescue other organs but Seckel (PM with dwarfism) paralogues cant.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Across a range of acquisition methods and sample inputs, the prototype instrument outperformed the standard Orbitrap Astral MS in precursor and protein identifications, ion accumulation efficiency, and reproducibility of measurements. To enable meaningful cross-platform comparisons, we implemented an ion calibration framework that converts signal intensity from arbitrary units to absolute ion counts (ions/sec). This benchmarking strategy showed that the prototype sampled 30% more ions per peptide than the original Orbitrap Astral MS. This increase in the ion beam utilization resulted in improved sensitivity and quantitative precision. To make these metrics broadly accessible, we added new metrics to the Skyline document grid to report ion counts directly from data-independent acquisition (DIA) data.

S.; Martinez-Yamout, M. A.; Dyson, J.; Wright, P. E.", "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins that mediate the cellular transcriptional response to hypoxia play important roles in turning on and turning off oxygen stress genes. In particular, the feedback inhibitor CITED2 operates a unidirectional switch that efficiently terminates the hypoxic response by displacing the C-terminal activation domain of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 from its complex with the TAZ1 domain of the transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300. Unidirectionality of the switch arises from subtle allosteric conformational changes in TAZ1 and from differences in the strength of thermodynamic coupling between the TAZ1-binding motifs in the multivalent HIF-1 and CITED2 activation domains. To investigate the role of binding cooperativity, we mutated a linker sequence in the HIF-1 activation domain to enhance or reduce the thermodynamic coupling between its TAZ1-binding motifs. An efficient native-gel assay shows that certain linker mutations enhance the affinity of HIF-1 for TAZ1, and fluorescence anisotropy competition and NMR measurements show that these mutants can compete with CITED2 for TAZ1 more effectively than wild-type HIF-1. The wide range of mutants, which include insertion, deletion, replacement and scrambling of residues in the linker, provide insights into the molecular basis for the exquisite tuning of the hypoxic switch: the TAZ1 affinity and consequent CITED2 competition enhancement depends both on the flexibility of the linker sequence (particularly the presence of glycine residues) and the unfavorable electrostatic interactions of a highly conserved arginine side chain in the center of the linker with an electropositive surface of TAZ1.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Theoretical studies predict two phases of phenotypic evolution: an initial directional phase, characterized by shifts in the mean of the trait towards a new optimum; and a subsequent stabilizing phase, in which the mean phenotype remains constant. However, there is limited empirical evidence to confirm these predictions. We exposed six replicate populations of Drosophila simulans, each with 100,000 individuals, to a new high-protein diet for 31 generations. Using time-series of high-order and molecular phenotypes, we characterized the phases of polygenic adaptation and inferred the transition between the directional and stabilizing selection phases empirically. The initial (directional) phase was characterized by a rapid phenotypic response, followed by a plateau after seven generations of adaptation, suggesting proximity to the new trait optimum (i.e. the stabilizing phase). The phenotypic responses were highly parallel among the replicate populations throughout the experiment. The contribution of pleiotropic loci to adaptive phenotypic evolution varied across the different phases of adaptation. Adaptation throughout the experiment was mainly facilitated by genes with low-to-intermediate pleiotropy, while highly pleiotropic genes played a significant role in the initial phase of adaptation. Parallel evolutionary responses across the replicate populations were also driven by genes with low-to-intermediate pleiotropy. Our findings support the predictions of theoretical models and provide empirical evidence for directional and stabilizing phases of polygenic adaptation.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Traditional approaches for protein sequence representation often rely solely on the 20 canonical amino acids, limiting the representation of non-canonical amino acids and residues that undergo post-translational modifications. This work explores discrete diffusion models for generating novel protein sequences using the all-atom chemical representation SELFIES. By encoding the atomic composition of each amino acid in the protein, this approach expands the design possibilities beyond standard sequence representations. Using a modified ByteNet architecture within the discrete diffusion D3PM framework, we evaluate the impact of this all-atom representation on protein quality, diversity, and novelty, compared to conventional amino acid-based models. To this end, we develop a comprehensive assessment pipeline to determine whether generated SELFIES sequences translate into valid proteins containing both canonical and non-canonical amino acids. Additionally, we examine the influence of two noise schedules within the diffusion process--uniform (random replacement of tokens) and absorbing (progressive masking)--on generation performance. While models trained on the all-atom representation struggle to consistently generate fully valid proteins, the successfully generated proteins show improved novelty and diversity compared to their amino acid-based model counterparts. Furthermore, the all-atom representation achieves structural foldability results comparable to those of amino acid-based models. Lastly, our results highlight the absorbing noise schedule as the most effective for both representations.

Here, we present a method for scalable, regulome profiling for global, compartment-resolved quantification of native regulome proteins. By enriching DNA- and chromatin-associated proteins and profiling them using high-throughput, label-free DIA mass spectrometry, regulome profiling captures chromatin-associated proteins across 36 human cell lines and thousands of perturbations. The resulting Regulome Atlas recovers nearly 60% of known human transcription factors, reveals lineage-specific TF localization, and distinguishes active nuclear engagement from latent, unbound states. We demonstrate that regulome profiles resolve acute immune pathway activation prior to transcriptional changes, identify previously unrecognized drug-induced regulome responses, and enable proteome-scale readouts of compound target engagement and complex remodeling.

Electrophysiology and functional imaging confirmed that RubyACRs effectively hyperpolarize neurons, with stronger and faster effects than the widely used inhibitor GtACR1. Activation of RubyACRs led to circuit-specific behavioral changes in three different neuronal groups. In glutamatergic motor neurons, activating RubyACRs suppressed adult locomotor activity. In PPL1-{gamma}1pedc dopaminergic neurons, pairing odors with RubyACR activation during learning produced odor responses consistent with synaptic silencing.

While these dual strategies are essential for persistence in diverse environments, how they interact and vary across closely related species is understudied. For plants, water availability is a particularly important selective force that shapes species distributions, selects for growth habit and life history strategy, and can dictate individuals plastic expressions of trait values and reproductive success. Here, we use ecological niche modeling, field soil collections, and a controlled drought experiment to test how biogeography and evolutionary history influence responses to limited water availability in three closely related Texas annual Phlox species and their F1 hybrids. We infer that the species occupy distinct niches that diverge along a primary axis of water availably and soil moisture. Each species has a distinct vegetative growth habit that does not match broad predictions of divergence in response to water availability. Nevertheless, we find that all the species show a significant morphological response to controlled soil dry down with reduced biomass, smaller leaves, and fewer flowers, as would be predicted in a response to drought. We find that Phlox drummondii, which occupies intermediate habitats, exhibits the strongest plastic response to water limitation, despite it not having the broadest environmental niche. Additionally, most hybrids involving P. drummondii display intermediate phenotypes in both wet and dry treatments, while hybrids between P. cuspidata and P. roemeriana show phenotypes consistent with hybrid vigor. These results challenge the hypothesis that species from broader environments evolve greater plasticity. Instead, the most plastic species did not have the broadest niche, suggesting plasticity and niche breadth may evolve independently.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Unlike end-to-end deep learning approaches, whose results are harder to interpret and control, the use of a well-established, classic technique such as MC sampling allows us to easily interpret the generative process as the sampling of an energy landscape determined by the pLM. In turn, such an interpretation enables us to steer this generative process and control its outcome by making use of robust statistical mechanics concepts, e.g., temperature, thereby explicitly guaranteeing certain properties of the generated mutants. Given the increasing relevance of generative algorithms in the design and search for novel, optimised enzymes, we believe that our results constitute an important step for the future development of this class of techniques.

We identified a critical 24-amino acid putative DNA-binding domain (DNABD) within the MH1 domain of the Drosophila I-Smad, Dad, that is essential for inhibitory function in wing tissue but unessential in neural tissue. Structural analyses revealed that {Delta}DNABD disrupts a beta hairpin structure homologous to R-Smad DNA-binding regions. We also found that Dad requires an intact MH1 domain to disrupt wing development, whereas either MH1 or MH2 can independently disrupt BMP signaling in motor neurons. These findings support a model where Dad functions through MH1-mediated transcriptional regulation in wing primordium, but through multiple mechanisms in neurons. Comparative analysis revealed that vertebrate I-Smad orthologs also show tissue-specific activity patterns, with structural predictions suggesting that Smad6 retains ancestral DNA-binding capacity while Smad7 has evolved enhanced MH2-mediated functions.

Existing theoretical frameworks typically rely on simplified spatial structures and do not adequately capture the heterogeneous migration patterns of natural populations. Here, we integrate network theory and mathematical population genetics to develop a framework for studying the genetic consequences of fragmentation processes, explicitly accounting for heterogeneous connectivity and temporal dynamics. We apply this framework to examine how different fragmentation processes affect genetic measures commonly used in genetic monitoring. We find that different fragmentation scenarios produce substantially distinct trajectories in key genetic measures, sometimes exhibiting rapid transitional dynamics, suggesting that the interpretation of genetic monitoring data must be tailored to ecological contexts. Furthermore, fragmentation can cause deviations from classical theoretical expectations, such as the expected correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation-by-distance) or between genetic diversity and connectivity. Finally, we propose and demonstrate detectable early warning signals in genetic monitoring data that precede rapid transitional phases.

We examined single unit responses in the human hippocampus while participants listened to podcasts. We first find that neurons encode the position of words within a clause, that they do so at multiple scales, and that they make use of both ordinal and frequency-domain positional encoding (which are used in some transformer models). Critically, neural responses to specific words correspond to a weighted sum of that words non-contextual embedding and the embedding of the words that contextualize it. Moreover, the relative weighting of the contextualizing words is correlated with the magnitude of the LLM-derived estimates of self-attention weighting. Finally, we show that contextualization is aligned with next-word prediction, which includes prediction of multiple possible words simultaneously.

Here, we identify a transcriptional circuit involving Lmx1, Cdkn1b, and Msx that regulates dorsal midline dynamics during NTC in the tunicate Ciona. High-resolution HCR in situ hybridization reveals that Lmx1 is dynamically enriched at the zippering point and advances in a posterior-to-anterior transcription wave, while Msx is downregulated in the same region, marking a transition from early neural patterning to morphogenetic execution. As closure progresses, Lmx1 and Cdkn1b exhibit complementary, alternating expression at the dorsal midline, resembling a pair-rule-like pattern. Misexpression studies show that Lmx1 promotes proliferation and activates its own expression, whereas Cdkn1b limits proliferation and impedes closure. Single-cell RNA-seq reveals transcriptionally distinct dorsal neural populations enriched for Lmx1 or Cdkn1b, supporting spatially organized cell-cycle states.

Despite its therapeutic potential, targeting Arp2/3 remains challenging due to the lack of precise molecular insights into endogenous inhibitors. Arpin, a lamellipodia-localized Arp2/3 inhibitor, has emerged as a critical modulator of cancer migration; however, the structural and mechanistic basis of its inhibitory function remains unresolved. Here, we report the 1.65-[A] crystal structure of Arpins N-terminal globular domain, revealing a unique structural fold distinct from all known Arp2/3-binding factors. Structural and biophysical analyses demonstrate that Arpin forms homodimers via a conserved interface, which is essential for cooperative inhibition of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. Functional studies in cancer models reveal that Arpin homodimerization potently suppresses lamellipodia-driven migration and invasion, effects further enhanced by engineered dimeric constructs or artificially designed dual-tailed peptides. These findings elucidate a structural basis for Arpin-mediated suppression of cancer cell motility and identify homodimeric cooperativity as a druggable mechanism for targeting metastatic progression. Our work provides a molecular framework for designing Arpin-inspired inhibitors to counteract therapeutic resistance and metastasis in cancers reliant on Arp2/3-driven actin dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

D.; Kimberley, A.; Immler, S.; Moorad, J.; Maklakov, A. A.", "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan in animals and plants, but its evolutionary causes are elusive. Adaptive hypotheses posit that DR extends lifespan because organisms reallocate resources from reproduction to survival (\"disposable soma\") or recycle cellular waste to maximize either their immediate reproduction (\"nutrient recycling\") or survival (\"clean cupboards\"). We developed an experimental paradigm that tricks Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes into increasing their reproductive effort under DR via food odour, thus allowing us to test these hypotheses. We found that experimentally increased reproduction under DR does not affect immediate or long-term survival benefits compared to DR animals that did not reproduce, thus refuting all three adaptive hypotheses. Our data suggest that a large part of suppressed fertility under DR is a result of organisms refraining from producing offspring in a poor environment. We developed a model based on Hamiltonian forces of selection to show that lifespan extension under DR evolves because DR suppresses fertility, directly increasing selection against mortality in DR environment. Our analytical approach suggests that DR-driven lifespan extension can evolve under a broader range of conditions not previously anticipated, such as a relaxed need for physiological or genetic trade-offs. Instead, we show how reduced survival on plentiful food can evolve via mutation accumulation.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

What is the energy consumption of non-equilibrium brain computation, i.e., what is the cost of cognition? Previous literature has estimated the metabolic cost using neuroimaging measures of glucose consumption but complementary to these findings, here we directly estimate the computational costs by combining the new field of stochastic thermodynamics with whole-brain modelling. We developed the COCO (COst of COgnition) framework using an analytical expression quantifying the links between energy cost, non-equilibrium and information processing for any given brain state measured with neuroimaging. Importantly, this key relationship also holds at the level of individual brain regions. We used this to quantify the benefits of information processing on the highly anatomically, interconnected hierarchical systems of the brain. Crucially, in empirical neuroimaging data we demonstrate that the human brain uses significantly less energy overall than other mammals (including non-human primates and mice), suggestive of an evolutionary optimisation of the effectiveness of computation. Focusing on the cost of cognition, using large-scale human neuroimaging data of 970 healthy human participants, we show that the resting state uses significantly less energy that seven different cognitive tasks. Furthermore, different kinds of tasks require different amounts of non-equilibrium, information processing and energy consumption. We found that tasks requiring more distributed computation also use more energy. Overall, these results directly quantify the cost of cognition, i.e., the non-equilibrium and energetic demands of information processing, allowing a deeper understanding of how the brain compute in a way that is far more energy efficient than current generations of digital computers and artificial intelligence.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Children born preterm have impaired brain development, and their perception of maternal speech is known to be affected by the atypical hospital auditory environment. Understanding how preterm infants perceive maternal singing is of critical importance, yet it remains largely unexplored. Using high-density EEG, we examined neural responses to the same melody presented through maternal singing, stranger singing, and instrument, and compared the responses in 12 preterm infants. Moreover, to examine their processing of spatialisation, auditory stimuli were presented under monaural and binaural conditions.\n\nPreterm newborns are able to discriminate the same melody when sung by their mother, a stranger, or played by an instrument. When presented monaurally, the mothers singing voice enhances widespread brain synchrony across the entire scalp. In contrast, this synchrony diminishes with binaural spatialization. These findings suggest that maternal singing constitutes a highly salient auditory stimulus for preterm newborns, eliciting a distinct neural signature. Given that brain synchrony is a critical component of healthy brain function and development, harnessing maternal singing may offer a promising, natural intervention to support neurodevelopment--particularly in vulnerable populations such as preterm infants.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

In temperate regions such as southern Sweden, it presents both opportunities, such as longer growing seasons, and challenges, including increased drought and heat stress. This study examined how Swedish agriculture is adapting to climate change, using the extreme 2018 drought and heatwave as a critical case to explore both immediate responses and longer-term preparedness in crop production systems. We compared scientific and local knowledge through a systematic scoping review of peer-reviewed literature from northern Europe, a workshop with project scientists, and a participatory workshop with farmers. The study aimed to identify gaps between scientific and local understandings of climate change adaptation, particularly in how extreme events influence decision-making and preparedness. Using a transdisciplinary, problem-feeding approach, we compared how farmers and scientists conceptualise crisis response and long-term adaptation, employing influence diagrams to visualise their understandings. Our review found that much scientific work focuses on short-term coping strategies, such as feed substitution or altered irrigation, while longer-term adaptation remains underexplored. In contrast, farmers emphasized context specific actions grounded in their farm operations, highlighting socio-economic and administrative constraints, whereas scientists tended to propose generalisable technology-oriented strategies. These differences underscore the importance of integrating both experiential and scientific knowledge to co-develop more effective adaptation responses. The study lays the foundation for a targeted, large-scale survey to explore farmer motivations, perceptions of risk and opportunity, and adaptive capacities across diverse contexts. Our findings highlight the need to move beyond reactive measures and investigate anticipatory strategies that foster and enable adaptive capacity.

Although studies have described the role of microbial, host, or environmental factors in disease development, their complex interplay, particularly during dysbiosis remains poorly understood. This cross-sectional study characterized the microbiome composition and metatranscriptomes of 125 peri-implant biofilms from 48 individuals uncovering molecular signatures linked to peri-implant health (PIH), PIM, and PI. Distinct variations were observed in biofilm amount, composition, activity, phage populations and host response. Biofilms were categorized into four community types (CTs) based on the bacterial transcriptional activity: one linked to PIH, one to PI, and two to PIM. PIH and PIM were primarily characterized by aerotolerant taxa with increased anabolic processes, while PI was dominated by obligate anaerobes with complex biofilm morphology, and heightened catabolic activity and virulence. PIM samples, relative to PIH were characterized by biofilm expansion with minimal functional changes, except for the Neisseria-rich PIM subtype showing higher pyruvate and lipoic acid metabolism. The phagome mirrored the bacterial compositional variations across disease states. Furthermore, human transcriptome responses varied indicating increased keratinization in PIH, enhanced expression of ribosome components in PIM, and inflammatory signaling and hypoxia in PI. Additionally, we identified complex species-enzyme, phage-bacteria, and host-microbe associations within the peri-implant ecosystem. Our integrative multi-omics approach provides a comprehensive view of microbial, biochemical, host, and ecological factors associated with dysbiosis, offering novel insights into peri-implant disease dynamics.\n\nImportancePeri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis are highly prevalent inflammatory conditions that compromise the long-term survival and success of dental implants, yet their underlying biological mechanisms are largely unresolved.

Metatranscriptomics overcomes this limitation by profiling actively transcribed genes within the biofilm, offering direct insights into microbial community functions. In this study, we integrated full-length 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with metatranscriptomic profiling to simultaneously assess microbial taxonomy, functional activity, phage dynamics, and host gene expression in peri-implant biofilms.

E.; Whitehead, C. R.; Mitchell, A. M.", "abstract": "Antibiotic resistant bacteria have been a rising clinical concern for decades. Beyond acquisition of alleles conferring resistance, bacteria under stress (e.g., from changing environmental conditions or mutations) can have higher intrinsic resistance to antibiotics than unstressed cells. This concern is expanded for gram-negative bacteria which have a protective outer membrane serving as an additional barrier against harmful molecules such as antibiotics. Here, we report a pathway which increases antibiotic resistance (i.e., minimum inhibitory concentration) in response to inactivation of the DNA Mismatch Repair pathway (MMR). This pathway led to increased intrinsic resistance and was independent of secondary mutations. Specifically, deletion of the DNA mismatch repair genes mutL or mutS caused resistance to various antibiotics spanning different classes, molecular sizes, and mechanisms of action in several different E. coli K-12 MG1655 strains, and in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2. This pathway was independent of the SOS response (severe DNA damage response). However, the patterns of resistance correlated with previously reported increases in MMR mutants in rates of homoeologous recombination, homologous recombination between non-identical DNA strands. Mutations expected to lower rates of recombination in MMR mutants also decreased the resistance to most antibiotics. Finally, we found lysis occurs in MMR mutants and may contribute to resistance to other antibiotics. Our results have demonstrated a novel mechanism that increases antibiotic resistance in direct response to loss of MMR genes, and we propose this resistance involves increased rates of homoeologous recombination and cell lysis. The increased antibiotic resistance of MMR mutants provides a path for these cells to survive in antibiotics long enough to develop more specific resistance mutations and so may contribute to the development of new clinical resistance alleles.\n\nAuthor SummaryAntibiotic resistance has become a worldwide clinical threat and understanding resistance mechanisms is essential for continued treatment of bacterial infections. Here, we investigate a novel mechanism acting in E. coli and Salmonella when DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is lost that increases the concentration of many antibiotics needed to kill cells and does not require secondary mutations. Our data suggest increased rates of homoeologous recombination (between non-identical DNA strands) and the lysis of some cells within a population are involved in this resistance. This pathway provides a mechanism through which cells with an increased mutation rate due to loss of MMR could survive long enough in the presence of antibiotics to develop new resistance mutations, leading to the spread of antibiotic resistance.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

When assessing microbial diversity, taxa, functional gene profiles, and gut permeability biomarkers, no significant differences were found between OA and controls. Although this does not exclude a causal contribution of the microbiota in the gut-joint-axis, its dysbiosis does not seem to be linked with OA disease progression. Instead, age and BMI appeared as the main contributing factors to microbiome changes.

In this study, we investigated the dynamic interaction between the reactivation of the implicit threat memory and these cognitive biases using a validated TC paradigm in humans.\n\nIn Experiment 1, participants underwent TC on Day 1, followed by a memory reactivation session (incomplete reminder: one unreinforced CS+) and a highly demanding working memory (HWM) task, used as an amnesic manipulation, or a control condition on Day 2. On Day 3, memory retention was tested using a simplified, single-trial protocol (one CS+, one CS-, and one neutral CS), followed by tasks assessing threat valuation and representation. Results indicated that the HWM task administered post-reactivation significantly reduced skin conductance responses (SCRs) and attenuated cognitive biases, without altering expectancy of the unconditioned stimulus (US).\n\nIn Experiment 2, we evaluated the effect of varying reactivation frequency (none, one, or two reminders) on implicit memory and cognitive biases. While repeated reactivations generalized the conditioned response to other stimuli, cognitive and emotional biases remained stable, suggesting a dissociation between memory generalization and evaluative processing.\n\nThese findings demonstrate that implicit threat memories can be selectively modified through post-reactivation interventions, affecting both physiological and cognitive-emotional domains. Importantly, the distinct effects of memory reactivation and reconsolidation on physiological versus cognitive outcomes support the existence of temporally and functionally dissociable mechanisms.

Glycomics of all 134 serum samples (sampled daily until recovery/death) revealed significant N-glycome dynamics across both patient groups. Unsupervised clustering of the serum N-glycome upon ICU admission (day 1) indicated survivorship-specific glyco- signatures. We therefore employed machine learning to train a random forest model using the serum N-glycome data.

Follow-up work by Blanca et al.

Our experiments show that it remains accurate for repetitive genomic sequences, such as the alpha satellite higher order repeats in centromeres. We demonstrate our estimator's robustness across diverse datasets and various ranges of the substitution rate and k-mer size. Finally, we show how sketching can be used to avoid dealing with large k-mer sets while retaining accuracy.

HCI has become a vital tool in biomedical research, supporting studies to characterize disease mechanisms and to identify new therapeutic agents. These studies often rely on high-throughput screening, which can involve thousands of chemical or genetic perturbations that produce terabytes of microscopy data. To extract meaningful biological insights, this data must be processed into quantitative features through a technique known as image-based profiling. A major analytical bottleneck is curating the high-dimensional, single-cell data derived from image analysis tools such as CellProfiler1,2, DeepProfiler3, Revvity Harmony, and Molecular Devices IN Carta.4 These datasets suffer from inconsistent data schemas, inefficient file formats (e.g., CSV, TSV, SQLite), and undocumented ontological relationships (integrations between data objects), which present significant challenges in data processing and standardization. These challenges reduce reproducibility and slow progress in downstream applications. To solve these issues, we introduce CytoTable5, a software package for harmonizing single-cell image-based profiling. CytoTable enables modular, portable, and cross-language data integration through a software stack comprising: (a) intermediate data curation harmonizing across multiple image analysis tools using Apache Arrow6, (b) serialized Arrow-compatible storage using Apache Parquet7, (c) high-performance SQL-based queries using DuckDB8, (d) a scalable execution engine using Parsl9 with Pythonic MapReduce10 design patterns, and (e) a Python-based execution runtime. By combining these technologies, CytoTable increases efficiency, accessibility, and interoperability of single-cell image-based profiling workflows. In essence, CytoTable is a robust, reproducible, and scalable engine that harmonizes single-cell readouts from multiple image analysis tools, preparing for feature integration with software in the Cytomining ecosystem such as Pycytominer.11", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Despite the belief that tumour acidosis drives tumorigenesis, it is still not clear how cancer cells respond to acidosis in the absence of other pathophysiological conditions. Here, we investigate how both acute and prolonged acidosis (pH 6.8) affects different epithelial features of a panel of carcinoma cell lines. We find that acute acidosis in all cell lines investigated represses the cell growth and causes a disturbance of adherens junctions and apical-basal polarity, reminiscent of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, we do not find that acute acidosis has a general effect on adhesion and migration in our panel of cell lines. Exposing our panel of carcinoma cell lines to acidosis for more than six weeks did not lead to adaptations restoring cell growth. On the contrary, prolonged acidosis caused one cell line (A431) to halt proliferation. Another cell line (A549) reacted to prolonged acidosis by gradually inducing the expression of ZEB2, which caused a partial EMT. In the rest of the cell lines, we did not find any noticeable effect of prolonged acidosis.

Proteomics revealed dysregulation of retinal and brain bacterial infection-related proteins and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways. NLRP3 expression was markedly elevated in MCI and AD retinas, and its activation was evident by increased N-terminal gasdermin D (NGSDMD) and mature interleukin-1{beta}.

Myofibroblasts drive fibrosis by depositing excess matrix, however the mechanisms driving fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation and how myofibroblast-secreted factors disrupt the alveolar niche, undermining lung repair and regeneration remain poorly understood. Here we show that YAP and TAZ are activated in lung fibroblasts from pulmonary fibrosis patients and bleomycin-treated mice. Targeted deletion of Yap/Taz in fibroblasts significantly dampened the fibroinflammatory response, decreased myofibroblast activation, and ultimately resulted in attenuated fibrosis and enhanced regeneration of alveolar epithelial cells after bleomycin-induced injury. Conversely, fibroblast-specific overexpression of constitutively active YAP (YAP5SA) aggravated fibrosis by amplifying fibroinflammatory responses and simultaneously suppressing alveolar epithelial regeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of YAP/TAZ using verteporfin halted the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis and even reversed established fibrosis in mice. Verteporfin effectively prevented fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and promoted collagen I degradation by lowering TIMP levels and enhancing activation of MMP1 and MMP9, demonstrating the significance of the YAP-TIMP-MMP1/9 axis in facilitating ECM breakdown. Furthermore, YAP activation in fibroblasts disrupted alveolar type II (AT2) cell homeostasis by inducing senescence through IGF1-IGF1R-mediated paracrine signaling. Blocking IGF1 signaling with a neutralizing antibody reduced the number of senescent AT2 cells, demonstrating the significance of the YAP-IGF1-IGF1R axis in maintaining alveolar epithelial cell homeostasis.

This capability is especially critical for free-living single-celled organisms, which routinely encounter mechanical stress from their natural habitats. We investigated Stentor coeruleus, a single-celled ciliate known for its remarkable wound repair capacity, as a model for studying mechanical wound resistance. While previous work focused on wound repair in Stentor, the structures that enable it to resist wounding remain poorly understood. We characterized how Stentor resisted mechanical stress during transit through a microfluidic constriction. Using high-speed imaging, we tracked the transit dynamics of the cells and linked them to wounding outcomes. Larger cells experienced longer transit times in the constriction and were more prone to rupture, often failing to recover shape due to membrane rupture and loss of cytoplasm. To elucidate the role of the Stentor cytoskeleton, we performed drug-mediated disruption of KM fibers, which are microtubule bundles in the Stentor cytoskeleton. Drug-treated cells exhibited an increased likelihood of membrane rupture at the constriction, implicating KM fibers in wound resistance. To investigate the resistance of Stentor cells to hydrodynamic stress, we injected the cells at increasing flow rates through the constriction. Interestingly, cells were more resistant to larger hydrodynamic stresses up to a threshold, potentially due to shear-thinning of the cytoplasm. Together, these results suggest that Stentor relies on both cytoskeletal architecture and cytoplasmic rheology to withstand mechanical stress, offering insights into cellular strategies for wound resistance in the absence of rigid extracellular structures.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Tau protein phosphorylation is critical for AD progression, and phosphorylation at Threonine 231 is thought to be an early disease-associated, gatekeeper event.

We also tested whether tau clearance via an Auxin Inducible Degron (AID) could reverse these deficits. Despite our hypothesis that prolonged stress in older animals would induce irreversible metabolic rewiring or maladaptation, tau depletion rescued known behavioral deficits at all ages tested, including in old worms which displayed the most overt phenotypes.

Yet, excessive increases in ploidy can also be disadvantageous and increase the risk of genome instability. Hence, a dedicated machinery, the PIDDosome multi-protein complex, has evolved to prevent exacerbated increases in DNA content. Using targeted mutagenesis in mice, we show that the PIDDosome controls hepatocyte ploidy in a cell-autonomous manner and that sequential and quantitative auto-processing of PIDD1 is key for accurate control of ploidy in postnatal development of liver and heart. Stoichiometric imbalances in bioactive PIDD1-fragments impair p53-dependent and independent cell cycle arrest responses during organogenesis, as well as caspase-2-dependent apoptosis caused by centrosome amplification.

Yet, choosing the best method for a study is challenging, because both the reliability for identification and the severity of adverse effects of a given mark type can greatly vary between species as well as life stages. We compared the reliability of three identification methods in young agile frogs (Rana dalmatina): clipping a single toe tip, injecting visible-implant-elastomer (VIE) tags (one of six colours) under the skin, and photo-based identification using natural colouration. Individuals were regularly photographed from the start of metamorphosis onwards, and were marked by the other two methods soon after all of them finished metamorphosis. Subsequently, we checked the presence of both the artificial and the natural marks multiple times for more than a year. Photo-based identification was far more reliable than the other two methods: 100 % identification success in all checking events across the entire study. Post-metamorphic body colouration remained largely stable, and the major patterns were already present at metamorphosis. Based on VIE colour alone, we could correctly identify the animals in 77 % of the checks. Green tags were the easiest to recognize. VIE often broke into smaller parts, and those were sometimes found only outside the originally tagged body part (15 %), or not found at all (10%). VIE was better retained in the legs than in the arm. Dissection revealed that migrating VIE pieces can accumulate in the internal organs, especially the kidneys. The clipped toe was successfully recognized only in 41% of the checks.

Whole genome duplication (WGD) might disrupt such gradually evolved patterns, since it has relatively instantaneous effects on sizes, but not numbers, of cells and organs. Here we ask whether sex allocation patterns differ between young neo-autotetraploid populations and their diploid progenitors within Galax urceolata. Floral organ sizes and numbers were measured using light microscopy and genome sizes verified with flow cytometry. Both cytotypes had the same number of flowers, anthers, and ovules per inflorescence, but floral organ sizes were proportionally longer in autotetraploids relative to diploid progenitors. Whole-plant allocation to volume of anthers increased by 176%, but of ovules only 70%. Autotetraploids produced 33% larger and 88% more pollen. WGD is known to double pollen volume, but pollen is biased to size reduction in young natural autotetraploids. In WGD-enlarged anthers, pollen size reduction allows increased pollen number to evolve without changing anther size. A literature review shows that higher pollen production in autopolyploid species is common, but not inevitable. Thus, we conclude that polyploidy can provide a pathway to increased pollen production, which may enhance male fitness during their early evolution.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Microchannels were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation in collagen and fibrin hydrogels. We optimized multiphoton lithography parameters to fabricate microchannels within these hydrogels and analyzed vascular formation along the channels. Luminal vascular structures formed readily in 50-m channels, while vascular formation failed in 20-m channels under static conditions, suggesting a significant shift in endothelial organization at the cellular scale. Flow stimulation significantly promoted vessel formation through collective endothelial cell migration and adhesion, whereas static conditions induced endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

E.; Vijayakumar, T.; Darji, K.; Hofbauer, S. I.; Alameh, M.-G.; Weissman, D.; Riley, R. S.", "abstract": "Placental dysfunction leads to pregnancy-related disorders that affect up to 15% of pregnancies. Several of these, such as preeclampsia, are symptomatically managed but have no curative treatments other than preterm delivery. Placental dysfunction arises from improper placental development, leading to restricted blood vessel formation and a hypoxic placental microenvironment. The development of placental therapeutics is challenging due to the complex physiology that enables the placenta to have precise control over endocytosis and transport. Here, we use a simple culture system that combines hypoxia and trophoblast syncytialization to model the functional syncytiotrophoblast layer of the placenta under hypoxic stress. Using this model, we evaluate the impact of hypoxia on lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated mRNA delivery. Our data shows that hypoxia hinders syncytiotrophoblast formation in vitro. Despite this, LNP delivery to syncytiotrophoblasts increases protein translation and secretion, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Further, we show delivery of a therapeutic mRNA, placental growth factor (PlGF), to syncytiotrophoblasts in hypoxia, which restored diminished PlGF levels back to normoxic controls. These findings provide an LNP platform for efficient mRNA delivery to hypoxic trophoblasts and demonstrate the importance of considering hypoxia towards the development of drug delivery platforms for placental therapeutics.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

We introduce a chromatic dynamic causal model (DCM) in which structural valency (or degree) modulates the spectral 'color' of endogenous fluctuations. Specifically, we assume a linear mapping between regional structural valency and the spectral exponent of scale-free auto-spectra. Simulations show this mapping can emerge as a generic consequence of structural embedding under minimal coupling in a non-equilibrium regime. We show chromatic DCM reliably recovers ground-truth parameters across network sizes and noise conditions, outperforming standard spectral DCM. Applied to empirical data, chromatic DCM reveals that valency-exponent mappings vary across a cortical hierarchy, and that its parameters are conserved across a homologous network in humans, macaques, marmosets, and mice.

A fundamental yet largely unresolved question is which stimulus features the brain predicts, and therefore, what kind of surprise drives neural responses. Here, we investigated this question using EEG and computational modelling based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Participants viewed object images whose identity was probabilistically predicted by preceding cues. We then quantified trial-by-trial surprise at both low-level (early DNN layers) and high-level (late DNN layers) visual feature representations. Results showed that stimulus-evoked responses around 200ms post-stimulus onset over parieto-occipital electrodes were increased by high-level, but not by low-level visual surprise.

However, brain dynamics are consistently shown to reside in a rather lower-dimensional space, which contains relevant information for cognition and behavior. This dimensionality reduction reflects distinct types of interactions between brain regions, such as redundancy -shared neural information distributed across regions- and synergy, where information emerges only when regions are considered collectively. Significant efforts have been devoted to developing linear and non-linear algorithms to reveal these low-dimensional dynamics, often termed \"brain modes.\" Here, we apply various dimensionality reduction techniques to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 100 healthy participants to examine how synergistic interactions in brain dynamics are preserved by these techniques. We first demonstrate that biologically informed brain parcellation modulates and preserves synergy-dominated interactions. Next, we show that synergy among low-dimensional modes enhances functional-connectivity reconstruction: nonlinear autoencoders not only achieve the lowest reconstruction error but also maximally preserve synergy, outperforming principal component analysis, diffusion maps, and Laplacian eigenmodes. Finally, we confirm previous results suggesting that global signal regression helps to identify synergistic interactions between regions. Our findings establish synergy preservation as a complementary criterion to reconstruction accuracy, highlighting autoencoders as a nonlinear tool for uncovering synergistic low-dimensional brain modes from high-dimensional neuroimaging data.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Objective: Cranial nerve stimulation (CNS) uses electric current to modulate higher-order brain activity and organ function via nerves, including the vagus and trigeminal, with applications in migraine, epilepsy, and pediatric ADHD. The trigeminal nerve is an emerging target for non-invasive neuromodulation due to the superficial trajectory of its branches, the supraorbital (SON), infraorbital (ION), and mental nerves (MN), and the predominantly sensory composition of the SON and ION. However, the parameters and outcomes of trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) remain varied. Approach: This study characterizes the anatomical course, tissue composition, and activation profiles of the SON, ION, and MN using five human donors. CT imaging was utilized to localize each nerve's exit foramen and distance to midline. Microdissections quantified nerve circumference and depth relative to the skin surface. Histological analysis described the number of fascicles and fascicular tissue area. Nerve depths were incorporated into computational models to illustrate the activation function across tissue layers, comparing expected nociceptor and nerve trunk activation functions as a measure of neural engagement. Main Results: The SON was found to be significantly more superficial than the ION and MN and had a higher nerve-to-connective tissue ratio relative to the MN. Computational modeling demonstrated that the activation function at the depths of nociceptors was orders of magnitude greater than within the main nerve trunks, suggesting preferential recruitment of cutaneous nociceptors, dependent on nociceptor density. Significance: The SON presents the most accessible and anatomically favorable target for transcutaneous trigeminal nerve stimulation among the branches examined due to its superficial location. However, preferential activation of low-threshold nociceptors compared to nerve trunks may lead to treatment-limiting off-target side effects, favoring strategies that target fibers of interest within the skin. These findings offer an anatomically informed framework to guide further computational modeling and electrode design for targeted trigeminal neuromodulation.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

P.; Jamison, K.; Kuceyeski, A.; Tozlu, C.", "abstract": "Introduction: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have shown disruptions in both brain structure and function, often studied separately. However, understanding the relationship between brain structure and function can provide valuable insights into this early stage of cognitive decline for better treatment strategies to avoid its progression. Network Control Theory (NCT) is a multi-modal approach that captures the alterations in the brain's energetic landscape by combining the brain's functional activity and the structural connectome. Our study aims to explore the differences in the brain's energetic landscape between people with MCI and healthy controls (HC). Methods: Four hundred ninety-nine HC and 55 MCI patients were included. First, k-means was applied to functional MRI (fMRI) time series to identify commonly recurring brain activity states. Second, NCT was used to calculate the minimum energy required to transition between these brain activity states, otherwise known as transition energy (TE). The entropy of the fMRI time series as well as PET-derived amyloid beta (A{beta}) and tau deposition were measured for each brain region. The TE and entropy were compared between MCI and HC at the network, regional, and global levels using linear models where age, sex, and intracranial volume were added as covariates. The association of TE and entropy with A {beta} and tau deposition was investigated in MCI patients using linear models where age, sex, and intracranial volume were controlled. Results: Commonly recurring brain activity states included those with high and low amplitude activity in visual (+/-), default mode (+/-), and dorsal attention (+/-) networks. Compared to HC, MCI patients required lower transition energy in the limbic network (adjusted p = 0.028). Decreased global entropy was observed in MCI patients compared to HC (p = 7.29e-7). There was a positive association between TE and entropy in the frontoparietal network (p = 7.03e-3). Increased global A{beta} was associated with higher global entropy in MCI patients (rho = 0.632, p = 0.041). Conclusion: Lower TE in the limbic network in MCI patients may indicate either neurodegeneration-related neural loss and atrophy or a potential functional upregulation mechanism in this early stage of cognitive impairment. Future studies that include people with AD are needed to better characterize the changes in the energetic landscape in the later stages of cognitive impairment.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

GATA6 is known to direct by default extra-embryonic endoderm. To promote definitive endoderm fate, GATA6 reinforces the endoderm GRN driven by NODAL while repressing the mesoderm GRN through down-regulation of WNT activity. During progression of mesoderm differentiation, GATA6 induces a switch in the transcriptional output regulated by WNT, promoting lateral mesoderm specification and repression of paraxial mesoderm fate. Thus, this single transcription factor mediates formation of four distinct tissue types, depending on integration of NODAL/WNT activities. Regulation of Eomes and T/Bra expression during anterior primitive streak progression is an essential function of GATA6 during the specification of endoderm or mesoderm fate.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Monitoring of survivors from 2021 - early 2025 showed that the population underwent an additional 96% decline in live tissue, 78% loss in living colonies, and 57% loss of genotypes. SCTLD continued to be the primary cause of these losses. Though some surviving tissue isolates exhibited small amounts of growth, the population remains extremely small, with only an estimated 9.6 square meters of tissue remaining on 23 colonies (15 genotypes). Additionally, colonies are far too dispersed to successfully fertilize spawned gametes. The further declines in the population since 2020 highlight the instability of the remnant population, as well as the value of the pillar coral rescue program and ongoing propagation efforts. As of February 2025, eight different in situ and ex situ facilities were caring for rescued D. cylindrus. Experimental fragmentation at one in situ nursery identified variable, but continually increasing, growth rates across multiple fragmentation events. Sexual propagation efforts at an ex situ nursery documented 105 different rescue fragments spawning across five years. The smallest fragment was 9 x 7 x 9 cm, establishing a potential \"minimum colony size\" for reproductive capacity for this species.

We collected thalli from hard and soft bottom habitats along the Eastern Shore of Virginia and Maryland to investigate the role of substrate on life cycle and reproductive mode dynamics. We determined the phase and sex using observable reproductive structures and a sex-linked PCR assay, followed by genotyping all thalli using nine microsatellite loci. Sexual reproduction prevailed in hard bottom sites, whereas clonal (asexual) reproduction dominated soft bottom sites and was accompanied by tetrasporophytic dominance. There was site-specific variation in selfing and clonal rates that are supported by observations of physiological stress and local extirpation, such as at Ape Hole Creek and Fowling Point, respectively. We found evidence of isolation by distance and the structuring of genetic diversity by habitat type, then site, and finally by year. While broad patterns have been described across the extant range, we clarify population genetic patterns in hard versus soft bottom habitats that are not confounded by the invasion history comparing native and non-native thalli.

Experimental and clinical research have contributed to the improvement of treatment outcomes dramatically in the past decade. However, much of the structure of the prostate and its constituent cell types remains unclear: observations of phenotypic switching between basal and luminal cells, as well as intermediate cell types between them, make classifying the components of the prostate an ongoing challenge. Importantly, a tumour's cell type of origin seems to play a role in the aggressiveness and genetic heterogeneity of the cancer. To understand how different structures between cell types impact the emergence and treatment of prostate cancer, we model the emergence of a tumour by a fit mutant arising amongst healthy cells via a compartmental modelling approach. We label cells in different compartments based on their phenotype and allow for phenotypic switching between them. We measure the time until and probability of invasion and extinction of this mutant in healthy prostates through individual-based simulations. We find that less-tight population size regulation of the luminal compartment allows for the explosive population growth associated with cancer. Tumours arising in the basal compartment require more time to spread but are more strongly embedded within the prostate, explaining the longer latency and higher aggressiveness and persistence associated with these tumours. Interestingly, the inclusion of a hybrid compartment does not qualitatively change the observations, raising questions as to what mechanistic role intermediate phenotypes play in prostate cancer emergence, if any.

PHTS individuals display heterogeneity in phenotypes, which has been linked in part to the diverse genetic alterations in the PTEN gene and the multifaceted functions of this protein. Indeed, while PTEN primarily functions as a PIP3 lipid phosphatase in the cytosol, regulating PI3K/AKT signalling, a pathway commonly deregulated in cancer, it also plays crucial roles in maintaining chromosomal stability through nuclear activities such as double strand (ds) DNA damage repair. Recent studies have identified a subset of missense PHTS variants that cause nuclear exclusion of PTEN, impairing its nuclear functions. Here, we present our findings from one such pathogenic variant, PTEN-R173C, frequently found in PHTS and somatic cancers. Using cell biological and mouse modelling approaches, we show that PTEN-R173C has higher PIP3 phosphatase activity than wild-type PTEN, resulting in effective regulation of canonical PI3K/AKT signalling. However, PTEN-R173C is unstable and excluded from the nucleus. Aligning with their near normal PI3K/AKT signalling, Pten+/R173C mice display a low incidence of solid tumours compared to Pten+/- mice. Pten+/R173C mice also exhibit lymphoid hyperplasia and macrocephaly which correlates with compromised nuclear functions of PTEN-R173C. That nuclear functions are compromised is demonstrated by reduced dsDNA damage repair in Pten+/R173C mice. Integrating PHTS patient data with findings from our mouse model, our study indicates that nuclear dysfunction of pathogenic PTEN variants is a key factor in predicting the onset of the different PHTS-associated phenotypes. We speculate that late-onset cancer in individuals with nuclear-excluded PTEN results from genetic alterations unrelated to PTEN itself, facilitated by impaired PTEN-mediated dsDNA damage repair.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

However, conventional materials such as metal, ceramic, polymer, and decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) have not yet yielded the desired outcomes. We have developed a collagen biomimetic material based on soluble collagen. This biomimetic material emulates the composition, structure, and function of native tissue. It possesses high strength, high affinity, high nutrient, and low antigenicity. The biomimetic material had been utilized to fabricate some implants (absorbable surgical suture, artificial tendon, hernia patch) and had demonstrated remarkable functional regeneration in animal experiments. In our previous researches, collagen surgical sutures facilitated wound healing, artificial tendons and artificial muscles (hernia patches) successfully repaired extensive defects of tendons and muscles, respectively. These successful tissue engineering endeavors enabled damaged defect to restore its biological functions and structure. Degradation of these biomimetic implants synchronized with the regeneration of the new tissues. Based on these successful functional regenerations, the present study focuses on regeneration of rabbit sciatic nerve. This collagen biomimetic material was employed to construct an artificial nerve tube (length: 2 cm, inner diameter: 2 mm, outer diameter: 3.5 mm) to repair a 2 cm-long defect in the rabbit sciatic nerve. After 36 weeks, the newly formed functional sciatic nerve successfully bridged the damaged ends, while approximately 92% of the artificial nerve tube has degraded. In this study, we provide an overview of the biomimetic material and its medical applications. We believe that these successful regenerations of tendon, muscle, and nerve all stem from the exceptional characteristics of this biomimetic material. We firmly believe that this collagen biomimetic material exhibits remarkable regenerative capabilities in diverse tissues. It can pave the way for the fabrication of increasingly critical artificial implants, which can be utilized to repair defects in human tissues, including artificial esophagi, tracheae, and small blood vessels. In regenerative medicine of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS), the biomimetic materials can replace temperature-sensitive materials (PIPAAm) to fabricate cell sheets. This approach expedites the process, enhances cellular vitality, and consequently improves regeneration outcomes. This material technology not only provides a revolutionary solution for clinical treatment but also paves the way for a new development direction in regenerative medicine.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Realizing its full potential demands light sources that combine multiplexed spectral flexibility, high pulse quality, and practical implementation for efficient excitation of diverse cellular targets. Here, we present a novel ultrafast fiber laser platform that enables efficient three-color multiplexed two-photon imaging through numerically optimized nonlinear spectral shaping in a photonic crystal fiber (PCF). The system is driven by a nonlinear Yb-doped fiber amplifier with tailored dispersion and gain characteristics to generate clean sub-50fs pulses at 1030 nm with over 40 nJ pulse energy. Subsequent, simulation-guided PCF-based spectral broadening enables controlled formation of three distinct high-energy bands centered at 940 nm, 1,080 nm, and 1,175 nm, overlapping with key fluorescent probes and biomolecular markers. The resulting pulses, isolated with high spectral and time-domain pulse quality, provide sub-115 fs duration and 2.5 - 6 nJ energy per channel. Multiplexed imaging is validated in labeled mouse brain, kidney, and liver tissue slices using spectrally independent multi-fluorophore targeting to visualize e.g., astrocytes, neuronal structures, and nuclei in triple-stained mouse hippocampus. The demonstrated fiber-optic laser platform provides a practical alternative to conventional single-color sources and more complex multi-laser systems, supporting robust and high-resolution three-color two-photon imaging for a range of biomedical applications.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

We tested the accuracy of this assumption using causal discovery based-analysis that go beyond associations/correlations to test the causality of influence of one region over the other. We hypothesized that the network of statistically significant (active network, AN) and non-significant regions (silent network, SN) causally interact and their features will causally influence psychopathology severity and working memory performance. Study Design: We examined AN and SN during N-BACK task on 25 FHR and 37 controls. Clusters with significantly different activations were juxtaposed to 360 Glasser atlas parcellations. The PC algorithm for causal discovery was implemented. Connectivity of regions with the highest alpha-centrality (HAC) were examined. Results: Seventy-seven Glasser regions were in the AN and the rest were silent nodes. Two regions showed HAC for FHR and HC. Among controls, one HAC region was silent (auditory association cortex) and the other one was active (insula). Among FHR, both were silent nodes (early auditory cortex). These HAC regions in both groups had bidirectional directed edges between each other forming a reciprocal circuit whose edge-weights causally increased magical ideation severity.

Analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data from cortical cells from a model of CHI, we found that Pycard (Asc), the gene encoding for a common inflammasome adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), is expressed particularly in microglial clusters.

Neonicotinoids are widely used pesticides that cause a catastrophic decrease in bee and bumblebee populations worldwide. In addition to insects, neonicotinoids have toxic effects on other species, including lizards, birds, and mammals. Previous studies have shown that gestational exposure to thiacloprid has transgenerational effects on the testis and thyroids. Objectives. In this project, we described the epigenetic effects of thiacloprid on anterior prostate tissue in directly exposed F1 males and nondirectly exposed F3 males. Methods. We used paraffin sections for morphological analysis, frozen tissue sections for immunofluorescence analysis, RT-qPCR for gene expression analysis, histone purification and western blotting for protein analysis, and ChIP-qPCR for histone H3K4me3 occupancy analysis. The results. We observed a tendency toward an increase in epithelial hyperplasia in F1 and not a significant increase in F3. We detected elevated levels of phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10, a marker of mitosis, in both the F1 and F3 prostates. A significant increase in the level of the Ki-67 marker of proliferation was detected in the F1 anterior prostate but not in the F3 anterior prostate. Hox gene expression was upregulated in F1 anterior prostate and downregulated in F3 anterior prostate. The changes in gene expression were associated with histone H3K4me3 alterations at the promoters of the genes. We determined that regions of Hox genes that play important roles in the anterior prostate have altered DNA methylation in the sperm of F1 and F3. These alterations in DNA methylation were negatively related to gene expression. Conclusion. Our analysis revealed that gestational exposure to thiacloprid caused epigenetic alterations in the anterior prostates of F1 males and nondirectly exposed F3 males.

Dysregulated release from hematopoietic tissue or excessive recruitment to inflamed sites is associated with immunopathologies, including chronic inflammation and recurrent infections. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid that signals through a family of G protein-coupled receptors (LPAR1-6). Among these, LPA-LPAR1 signaling is activated in inflamed tissues and is known to modulate neutrophil infiltration during inflammatory responses. However, its role in neutrophil dynamics during early development remains unclear. Here, we report a novel function of Lpar1 in regulating neutrophil behavior during early zebrafish development. In Lpar1-deficient embryos, we observed a significant increase in neutrophil dispersal from the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf), with most dispersed neutrophils infiltrating the skin and contributing to elevated inflammatory signaling. Prior to dispersal, Lpar1-deficient embryos exhibited increased apoptosis of superficial epidermal cells and reduced expression of cxcl12a, a key retention signal for neutrophils in the CHT. Together, these findings highlight an essential role for Lpar1 in maintaining neutrophil retention and epidermal homeostasis during early development, thereby limiting inappropriate inflammation.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThis work identifies a new role for a known inflammatory receptor in coordinating immune cell retention and skin stability during early development.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

This study introduces the Continuous Performance Critical Stability Task (cpCST), a novel paradigm combining high-density sampling of behavior (30Hz), individualized calibration, and fixed-difficulty assessment to measure attentional control. In a sample of 166 adults (ages 18-76), we evaluated the psychometric properties of the cpCST's instantaneous reaction time (iRT) metric derived through dynamic time warping. Results demonstrated exceptional reliability (bootstrap split-half r = .999), age invariance, and predictive validity for cognitive performance (flanker and Woodcock-Johnson) and cardiorespiratory fitness (est.

The cpCST's individualized calibration effectively isolated attentional control processes from baseline sensorimotor function, eliminating age-related slowing effects typically observed in reaction time tasks.

In this paper, we used fish shoal as a unit of collective behaviour, and investigated variations in shoaling adaptations across a range of manipulations, mimicking challenges faced by the species under natural conditions. We used green chromides (Etroplus suratensis), a cichlid fish species, and characterised their shoaling behaviour under laboratory conditions for two group sizes, 4 and 8. We then examined the effects of different manipulations, for example, starvation and reduced space (both mimicking resource constrained conditions), and presence of hetero species including tilapia (Oreochromis sp., an alien species widespread within the habitats of E. suratensis) on their shoaling behaviour. Our results showed that E. suratensis formed shoals in both group sizes, 4 and 8. In subsequent analyses, we used group size 8 as a control and demonstrated that space reduction and starvation significantly impacted shoaling, reducing shoal splits and occurrences of solitary fish, while increasing incidences of single, cohesive shoals comprising all individuals. E. suratensis also formed mixed-species shoals with alien Oreochromis spp., but exhibited a large percentage (in absolute terms) of shoal splits. Overall, E. suratensis exhibited plasticity in their shoaling behaviour, and increased fusion of shoals under challenging conditions, which was in contrast to showing more fission in presence of the alien hetero species.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}
{"title": "The recognition of behaviorally distinct sleep stages in Drosophila melanogaster uncovers previously obscured homeostatic and circadian control of sleep.", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.23.661143", "authors": "Abhilash, L.; Shafer, O. T.", "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms underlying homeostatic sleep regulation is a central unmet goal of sleep science. Our understanding of such regulation in mammals has required recognizing distinct sleep stages. Drosophila melanogaster is an important genetic model system for understanding sleep. Since the discovery of sleep-like states in the fly 25 years ago, the field has treated sleep as a unitary state consisting of any inactivity lasting 5 minutes or longer, despite convergent work suggesting the existence of multiple sleep stages. Here, we establish that three distinct sleep stages in flies can be classified based on simple inactivity duration criteria. We show that the daily initiation of these sleep stages is temporally distinct, with long sleep occurring immediately following the largest daily period of wakefulness. We show that rebound in response to mechanical sleep deprivation is present only in long sleep and comes at the expense of shorter sleep stages. Deprivation-induced decreases in shorter sleep stages obscure homeostatic sleep rebound when sleep is measured using traditional methods. We observe distinctly timed ultradian oscillations of fly sleep stages, reminiscent of mammalian sleep cycles. Our results indicate that the fields unitary definition of fly sleep has outlived its usefulness and call for the re-examination of sleep regulation in the fly using methods that reflect the unique relationships among sleep stages and their homeostatic and circadian control. The recognition of these sleep stages will be necessary to fully realize the promise of the Drosophila model system for identifying conserved genetic mechanisms underlying such regulation.\n\nSignificanceThe fact that sleep episodes comprise distinct stages in humans and mammalian model systems has been a fundamental discovery in sleep science. This recognition enabled researchers to study the physiological underpinnings of sleep stages and examine the comorbidities and consequences associated with disrupted sleep. The mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis remain an open problem, and the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster continues to be a powerful genetic and neurobiological model to study sleep regulation. Despite recent convergent evidence for distinct sleep stages in the fly, the field continues to treat sleep as a unitary state consisting of any inactivity lasting five minutes or longer. This practice likely obscures important aspects of sleep regulation in the fly, limiting its impact on our understanding of sleep regulation. Inspired by recently developed wearable technologies, which score sleep stages based on motion detection and accelerometry, we asked if distinct fly sleep stages can be identified based on durations of inactivity bouts, and, if so, whether stages of fly sleep are differentially regulated by the two major processes governing sleep: sleep homeostasis and circadian timekeeping. We show that discrete sleep stages can be identified and have distinct relationships amongst each other and to homeostatic sleep regulatory and circadian control centers. Importantly, we find that sleep deprivation produces increases in longer, deeper sleep stages while producing decreases in shorter sleep stages. These opposing responses to deprivation obscure homeostatic sleep responses when the traditional, unitary definition of sleep is used, a reality that has likely hampered the identification of homeostatic regulatory mechanisms in the fly. We concluded that using the simple behavioral criterion we describe here to differentiate sleep stages will be critical for understanding homeostatic and circadian sleep regulation in Drosophila, which remains an important model organism for the discovery of mechanisms of sleep regulation.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

A.; Ryan, M. J.; Taylor, R. C.; Hunter, K.", "abstract": "Across many taxa, males gather in leks to perform multisensory courtship displays for females. At a lek, changes in the sensory scene over the course of mate evaluation are inevitable. This dynamic nature makes a females ability to recall the location of individual signalers an important component of female mate choice. It is hypothesized that complex (especially multimodal) displays may improve a females ability to remember and thus discriminate amongst potential mates. To test this hypothesis, we presented female tungara frogs (Physalaemus (=Engystomops) pustulosus) with male calls (auditory) and robotic frogs (visual) that could later be obstructed from view via the lowering of blinds. Specifically, we asked if the visual component of a multimodal display improves the ability of a receiver to remember a signaler. While our initial experiment did not find memory instantiation in female frogs, subsequent experiments with a longer presentation time and a brief period of silence successfully instantiated memories in females. Moreover, females continued to demonstrate significant preferences for calls associated with the visual cue even after 25 s following the obstruction of the visual stimulus (robotic frog). Thus, we propose that the duration of presentation and/or the silent period impact memory capability. Silence is common in choruses, and our data suggest that complex, multisensory stimuli may have evolved to help females remember their preferred mate even with such fluctuations in signal production.\n\nLAY SUMMARYMultisensory signals function to stimulate one or more of a receivers senses, and in doing so, may make signalers more memorable to receivers. Multisensory signals are common in mating displays, including the advertisement of a male tungara frog: a call (acoustic) and a vocal sac inflation (visual).

Protein Kinase CK2 has been previously associated with different aspects of tau pathology but genetic evidence for the contribution of CK2 to tauopathy remained lacking. Here, we show CK2, one of the two catalytic subunits of CK2, as a novel regulator of tau-mediated neurodegeneration. We found that CK2 expression is elevated in the hippocampus of PS19 tauopathy mice and in postmortem brains of dementia patients, particularly in neurons and microglia. Using genetic haploinsufficiency in PS19 mice, we demonstrated that reduced CK2 levels significantly decrease phosphorylated tau and total tau burden in the hippocampus and cortex. CK2 depletion also enhanced synaptic gene expression, synaptic density, and LTP, while attenuating microglial activation, synaptic engulfment, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Importantly, CK2 depletion rescued cognitive deficits assessed in the Barnes maze.

M.", "abstract": "We tested whether the same principles of actuation and control that support steady-state walking are sufficient for robust, rapid gait adaptation over a wide range of step lengths and frequencies. We begin by demonstrating that periodic limit cycle gaits exist at combinations of step frequency and step length that span the full range of gaits achievable by humans. We demonstrate that open-loop local stability is not enough to rapidly transition to target gaits because some gaits in the gait space are unstable and the stable gaits have slow convergence rates. Next, we show that actuating with only one push-off and one hip spring of fixed stiffness cannot fully control the walker in the entire gait space. We solve this by adding a second hip spring with an independent stiffness with respect to the first one to actuate the second half of the swing phase. This allowed us to design local feedback controllers that provided rapid convergence to target gaits by making once-per-step adjustments to push-off and hip spring stiffnesses. To adapt to a range of target gaits that vary over time, we interpolated between local controllers. This policy performs well, accurately tracking rapidly varying combinations of target step length and step frequency with human-like response times across a wide range of human achievable gaits. To test whether this policy is biologically plausible, we use it with supervised learning to train an artificial neural network to perform nearly identical control.\n\nAuthor SummaryPeople can rapidly adapt their walking gaits. In this study, we used a modeling approach to study whether control of walking adaptation is identical to control of steady state walking. We first demonstrate that the model can produce human-like gaits over a wide range of step lengths and step frequencies. However, we found that unlike steady state walking, the model does not transition between gaits quickly or reliably. To address this, we introduced an additional actuation to control the swing leg and used feedback control that applies once-per-step adjustments to the actuations. This enabled the model to rapidly converge to target gaits, even when the targets changed from one step to the next. To test whether this policy is biologically plausible, we use it with supervised learning to train an artificial neural network to perform nearly identical control. This work provides insights into the mechanisms of walking adaptation and has potential implications for the design of adaptive control in robotic and wearable assistive systems.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Avoidance motivated by learned fear may constitute a major obstacle to treatment success in extinction-based interventions. However, the effects of avoidance on visceral pain-related fear extinction remain poorly understood. By implementing an ecologically valid experimental protocol, we investigated how costly avoidance affects the modulation and extinction of visceral pain-related fear. Thirty-three healthy volunteers underwent conditioning with visual cues (conditioned stimuli; CS+,CS-) consistently followed by visceral pain or remaining unpaired. During avoidance, participants decided to avoid or receive pain upon confronting CS+. Avoidance decisions resulted in pain omission in some trials, while in others, participants experienced unpredictable pain. During extinction, CS were presented unpaired. CS valence, fear, and trial-by-trial decisions were analyzed. Avoidance decisions depended on prior experiences, with the highest probability of avoidance following successful pain omission. Negative CS+ valence and fear remained elevated across avoidance and extinction. Learned fear and more avoidance decisions explained 57% variance in sustained CS+ fear. Our findings indicate that avoidance, which provides short-term absence of pain even when followed by unpredictable pain, motivates its maintenance.

In a subset of rats, tissue oxygen was also measured. Blood pressure was pharmacologically modulated to alter vascular oscillations. We found that vasomotion was driven by the arterial tree. Two prominent activity patterns emerged: global vasomotion across the entire hemisphere and phasic vasomotion seen as a travelling wave running through the surface arteries. Moreover, vasomotion was associated with low tissue oxygen and was largely independent of spontaneous neural activity and therefore not a product of neurovascular coupling.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Notably, the iEC-derived hierarchy revealed a monotonically increasing level along the axis where the sensorimotor, association, and paralimbic areas are sequentially ordered - a pattern supported by the Structural Model of laminar connectivity. This hierarchy was further demonstrated to flexibly reorganize across brain states: flattening during an externally oriented condition, evidenced by a reduced slope in the hierarchy, and steepening during an internally focused condition, reflecting heightened engagement of interoceptive regions.

Beyond local damage, SCI induces systemic inflammation, including cerebral inflammation that impairs neurogenesis. While cell therapies show promising effects in animal models, such as scar reduction and neuroprotection, their benefits in humans remain limited. One key difference lies in the transplantation strategy: animals receive healthy donor cells, whereas humans require autologous transplants. This led us to investigate how the lesion context affects the neuro-reparative potential of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) harvested from olfactory bulbs.\n\nTo this end, we cultured OECs from healthy animals and from animals that had undergone SCI one week earlier. We then transplanted both types of OECs into recipient animals after SCI for therapeutic purposes. Using functional sensory-motor studies, histological and gene expression analyses, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that the lesion negatively affects the therapeutic properties of cells used to treat SCI. Indeed, transplantation of cells from previously injured animals does not modulate the fibrotic and glial scar, or the demyelinated areas at the lesion site, and therefore fails to improve functional recovery; unlike cells derived from healthy donors. Moreover, our in vitro studies show that cells derived from SCI animals secrete pro-inflammatory molecules that promote the polarization of microglia toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Altogether, these innovative findings provide new insights into the potential of cell transplantation in the context of autologous therapy after SCI.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=147 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/660789v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@810529org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@79fa4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7c3aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114e7cd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Prior research has hypothesized a key role of prediction error and theta oscillations in medial frontal cortex in this process. However, the causal link between such processes remains to be established. To address this, we combined neural stimulation, EEG, behavioral measurement, and computational modelling. Specifically, we applied high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to modulate theta oscillations as measured via EEG followed by a probabilistic reversal learning task. We find that anodal stimulation reduces theta power and rule prediction error, and it increases the number of trials needed to reliably switch between rules. These findings support the role of rule prediction error signaling as a key mechanism linking neural oscillations to behavioral adaptation and highlight the importance of theta power and rule prediction error for cognitive flexibility.\n\nSignificance statementCognitive flexibility--the ability to adjust behavior when rules change--is critical for adaptive behavior in uncertain environments. Although prediction error signaling and theta oscillations in medial frontal cortex have been proposed as key mechanisms, their causal relationship remains unclear. Here, we combine high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS), EEG, behavioral assessment, and computational modeling to establish a mechanistic link.

We show that the dynamics is governed by a finite number of master modes whose nonlinear interactions can be described by a normal form. This formulation provides a simple picture of learning as a Fourier decomposition of the target pattern with amplitudes determined by nonlinear interactions that, remarkably, become independent of the network randomness in the limit of large network size.

However, the functions of DNMT3A during human cortical development remain poorly understood. Here, we utilized newly developed human pluripotent stem cell models of TBRS-associated DNMT3A mutation to define DNMT3A requirements and consequences of mutation during human cortical neuron development. Profiling changes to epigenetic gene regulation across both GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron development, we identified GABAergic cortical interneurons as particularly sensitive to TBRS-associated mutation. During GABAergic neuron development, TBRS-associated DNMT3A mutations resulted in reduced DNA methylation and were associated with concomitant de-repression of gene expression, causing precocious neuronal differentiation. By contrast, the consequences of DNMT3A mutation on glutamatergic neuron development were less pronounced, due in part to compensatory repressive histone methylation, and resulted in increased expression of early neurodevelopmental genes during glutamatergic neuron differentiation. Assessing the consequences of these molecular phenotypes by patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that DNMT3A deficient GABAergic neurons were hyperactive, while glutamatergic neuron function was largely unaffected by these DNMT3A loss of function mutations. Finally, we used both low density and high density multi electrode array techniques in conjunction with glutamatergic-GABAergic neuron co-cultures to assess how TBRS-associated GABAergic neuron hyperactivity affected the emergence and development of neuronal networks. We found that TBRS GABAergic neuron hyperactivity was sufficient to drive abnormal neuronal network development, increasing the neuronal activity consolidated into neuronal bursting and networks. Ultimately, this work elucidated new roles for DNMT3A-mediated repression in human cortical development, identifying critical requirements in regulating neuronal and synaptic gene expression during GABAergic differentiation, with these TBRS-associated molecular changes driving alterations of neuronal network function likely to contribute to TBRS etiology.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

This meta-analysis synthesizes fMRI results of activation differences between preterm and full-term subjects during executive functioning tasks in adult and child groups separately. Our results indicate that differences in neural engagement during EF tasks differ between pre-term (PT) and full term (FT) individuals in both age groups. Moreover, the regions affected contribute to well-known brain networks, including the fronto-striatal circuitry, the default mode network (DMN), and the salience network, all of which subserve broad EF capabilities. We found no differences between child and adult maps in a direct contrast, suggesting that effects of prematurity on executive functioning may persist from childhood into adulthood, although these findings should be interpreted in context of methodological limitations and potential confounding factors.

Model-free analysis of our data suggested unexpected trials resulted in reduced accuracy and greater response times. In unexpected trials, high pain perception was reduced, while low pain perception was increased, in line with documented effects of expectations on pain perception. Computational model fitting revealed participants learning was best described by a two-level hierarchical gaussian filter model, suggesting participants adapted their beliefs at multiple levels during the task. Uncertainty influenced pain perception in opposite patterns for high and low pain stimulations : high pain perception was greater under high levels of uncertainty while there was a non-significant trend for low pain perception to be reduced.

However, decoding EEG data remains challenging, as classification algorithms typically require large datasets that are expensive and time-consuming to collect. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence have enabled the creation of realistic synthetic EEG data, yet no method has consistently demonstrated that such synthetic data can lead to improvements in EEG decodability across diverse datasets. Here, we introduce EEG-GAN, an open-source generative adversarial network (GAN) designed to augment EEG data. In the most comprehensive evaluation study to date, we assessed its capacity to generate realistic EEG samples and enhance classification performance across four datasets, five classifiers, and seven sample sizes, while benchmarking it against six established augmentation techniques. We found that EEG-GAN, when trained to generate raw single-trial EEG signals, produced signals that reproduce grand-averaged waveforms and time-frequency patterns of the original data. Furthermore, training classifiers on additional synthetic data improved their ability to decode held-out empirical data. EEG-GAN achieved up to a 16% improvement in decoding accuracy, with enhancements consistent across datasets but varying among classifiers. Data augmentations were particularly effective for smaller sample sizes (30 and below), significantly improving 70% of these classification analyses and only significantly impairing 4% of analyses. Moreover, EEG-GAN significantly outperformed all benchmark techniques in 69% of the comparisons across datasets, classifiers, and sample sizes and was only significantly outperformed in 3% of comparisons. These findings establish EEG-GAN as a robust toolkit for generating realistic EEG data, which can effectively reduce the costs associated with real-world EEG data collection for neural decoding tasks.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

In this regard, we previously showed that in a mouse model of parkinsonism with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection into the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), low doses of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) partial agonist and smoking cessation drug, cytisine exerts sex-specific neuroprotection in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons of only female mice by reducing apoptotic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Although these data suggest that neuroprotection might occur via cytisine-mediated upregulation of {beta}2 subunit-containing ({beta}2*) nAChRs in SNc DA neurons, there is no direct evidence to support this idea. Therefore, this study asks the critical question of whether upregulation of {beta}2* nAChRs in SNc DA neurons alone is sufficient to reduce apoptotic ER stress and exert neuroprotection in a preclinical unilateral DLS mouse model of 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonism. To address this question, we generate and characterize a novel {beta}2-upregulated transgenic mouse line. These transgenic mice possess mutations in the M3-M4 intracytoplasmic loop of {beta} subunits that cause constitutive upregulation of {beta}2* nAChRs without nicotinic ligands. Surprisingly, when compared to wild-type littermates, only female {beta}2-upregulated transgenic mice demonstrate upregulation of {beta}2* nAChRs in SNc DA neurons as assessed by significant increases in Sec24D-containing ER exit sites (Sec24D-ERES). Using the optogenetic calcium and dopamine sensors, GCaMP6f and GRABDA respectively, we found significant increases in dihydro-beta-erythroidine (Dh{beta}E)-sensitive {beta}2* nAChR-mediated calcium influx in SNc DA neuron dendrites and Dh{beta}E-sensitive acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked dopamine release at SNc DA neuron terminals of the DLS in female transgenic mice. We then used four independent readouts to assess neuroprotection of SNc DA neurons following unilateral 6-OHDA injection into the DLS, viz., contralateral apomorphine-induced rotations, preservation of SNc DA neurons, inhibition of a major proapoptotic ER stress protein, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) expression in SNc astrocytes. In all four readouts, female {beta}2-upregulated transgenic mice showed significant neuroprotection. From a clinical perspective, this study shows that upregulation without nicotinic ligand-mediated activation of {beta}2* nAChRs in SNc DA neurons can be a translationally viable disease-modifying strategy for Parkinsons disease. In addition, we envision that the novel transgenic {beta}2-upregulated mice created in this study will provide a valuable tool for understanding the role of nAChR upregulation in major neurological disorders such as addiction, anxiety, depression and dementia.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Saturation experiments revealed a KD around 4 nM for the human temporal cortex and 7 nM for the mouse brain.

Interestingly, a highly significant negative correlation was seen between MAGL and binding to the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) expressed in glia.

Symptoms of sympathetic dysfunction are prevalent in diabetes, affecting up to 90% of patients. The molecular and cellular composition of the human SCG and its alteration in diabetes remains poorly defined. To address this gap, we performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of lumbar SCGs from diabetic and non-diabetic organ donors. We identified 3 three distinct neuronal populations, two noradrenergic (NA1 and NA2) and one cholinergic (CHO), based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and SLC18A3 expression, respectively. We also characterized 9 non-neuronal populations consisting of Schwann cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and endothelial cells. In diabetic SCGs, we observed a significant loss of myelinating Schwann cells and a phenotypic shift of cholinergic neurons toward a noradrenergic identity. Additionally, diabetes was associated with a significant reduction in the transcripts of vasodilatory neuropeptides, such as VIP and CALCA, suggesting a mechanism for impaired vascular control. Upstream regulator analysis highlighted altered neurotrophic signaling in diabetes, with enhanced NGF/TRKA and diminished BDNF/TRKB activity, potentially driven by target-derived cues. Comparison between SCG and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons revealed ganglia-specific genes, like SCN3A and NPY (SCG) versus SCN10A and GPX1 (DRG), offering specific therapeutic targets for autonomic dysfunction or pain. Our findings provide a transcriptomic characterization of human SCG, revealing molecular signatures that underlie diabetic autonomic dysfunction. This work lays a foundation for the development of therapies to restore sympathetic function and avoid unintended autonomic effects in the development of analgesics.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

We developed a specific SaCas9 guide RNA to target human mHTT, and a self-inactivating gene editing system that abolishes SaCas9 after a short transient expression for high gene editing efficiency and maximal safety to prevent off-target effects. Both conventional and the new self-inactivating gene editing systems achieved successful elimination of mHTT gene, 60-90% mHTT protein and 90% of mHTT aggregation in BAC226Q HD mouse brains, which resulted in significant long-term rescue of neural pathology, motor deficits, weight loss and shortened lifespan. These beneficial effects were observed when gene editing was applied before, at and well after the on-set of pathological and behavioral abnormalities.

Elucidating the relationships between balance control and sensorimotor function is crucial for developing effective rehabilitations. Here, we compared the kinematic responses to platform translations and rotations during standing in 10 young and 30 older adults and explored relationships between sensorimotor function and balance responses. We found that older adults were less able to withstand perturbations without stepping, not because their non-stepping strategies were less effective but because they chose to step at smaller deviations of the extrapolated center of mass. Older adults performed worse than young adults on measures of sensory and motor function but lower stepping thresholds were associated with susceptibility to unreliable visual information and not with reduced sensory acuity or reduced strength. Poor sensory reweighting may contribute to and combine with age-related cognitive rigidity, leading to a higher priority on safer strategies. Older adults may resort to stepping, even if a step is not necessary, rather than rely on potentially inaccurate sensory signals to inform a corrective response.

However, multi-electrode ICMS often generates suboptimal percepts compared to single-electrode ICMS, suggesting nonlinear neuromodulation rather than simple summation by multi-electrode ICMS. Yet, the factors and mechanisms underlying this modulation remain poorly understood. To investigate multi-electrode ICMS, we combined two-photon calcium imaging with a well-controlled dual-electrode ICMS in the mouse visual cortex to investigate how neurons integrate converging ICMS inputs at varying intensities. We found that stimulation intensity significantly shapes neuromodulation at both single-cell and population levels. Specifically, low intensities (5-7 A) have a minimal effect on neural responses. At intermediate intensities (10-15 A), we observed diverse, nonlinear bipolar modulation--both enhancement and attenuation--at the single-cell level. However, we achieved net enhancement at the population level. At higher intensities (15-20 A), although the proportion of modulated neurons increased in both enhancement and attenuation directions, the net effect at the population level was neutral (zero modulation). Furthermore, neurons strongly responsive to single-electrode ICMS were more likely to be attenuated, while weaker responding cells exhibited enhanced modulation. The strongest neuromodulatory effects occur at intermediate spatial distances in between the two electrodes. Computational modeling based on spiking neural network composed of adaptive exponential integrate-and-field neurons implicated the importance of inhibitory network dynamics and network variability as key mechanisms. Our experimental data was used to train an advanced deep learning approach, which successfully predicted the neuromodulation patterns induced by dual-electrode ICMS. Our findings reveal intensity- and spatial-dependent rules of neuromodulation by ICMS, providing necessary insights to optimize multi-electrode ICMS for neuroprosthetic applications.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

In particular, slow wave activity (SWA) has emerged as a key marker of both cortical maturation and experience-dependent plasticity. Understanding the regional dynamics of sleep neurophysiology early in life could yield critical insights into neurodevelopmental health. We conducted a longitudinal high-density EEG study in 11 healthy infants (3-6 months) assessing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. We analyzed the maturation of SWA (0.75-4.25 Hz), theta power (4.5-7.5 Hz), and sigma power (9.75-14.75 Hz) across scalp regions and examined their association with behavioral development. From 3 to 6 months, SWA increased maximally in occipital regions, while theta power exhibited a global increase. Sigma power, initially concentrated centrally, dispersed towards frontal regions. Greater power increases over frontal regions correlated with higher motor (theta) and personal-social skill scores (sigma) at 6 months. These findings establish a framework for typical infant sleep EEG maturation, highlighting frequency-specific and regionally distinct developmental patterns. This study provides the first longitudinal evidence that early changes in sleep EEG topography reflect individual developmental trajectories, supporting its utility as a non-invasive and yet precise biomarker for early identification of atypical neurodevelopment at preverbal ages.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

These sensory differences are shaped by top-down cognitive processes, such as categorization, attention, and priors, which themselves exhibit characteristic atypicalities in the condition. Among sensory modalities, tactile perception is particularly critical for daily functioning and social interactions. However, the dynamic interplay between tactile and cognitive processes remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of top-down cognitive processes on tactile perception in the Fmr1-/y genetic mouse model of autism. We developed a translational, forepaw-based decision-making task designed to dissociate stimulus-driven tactile responses from those modulated by cognitive factors. This approach enabled us to assess multiple aspects of perceptual processing, including perceptual learning, stimulus categorization and discrimination, as well as the influence of prior experience and attention. Mice were initially trained to distinguish between high- and low-salience stimuli and were subsequently tested with a continuum of intermediate stimulus intensities. Our results revealed salience-dependent cognitive alterations that significantly influenced sensory performance. During the training phase, Fmr1-/y mice exhibited an increased choice consistency bias in low-salience trials, resulting in impaired perceptual learning. In the testing phase, Fmr1-/y mice demonstrated enhanced tactile discrimination under low-salience conditions, driven by a reduced influence of categorization. Moreover, under conditions of high cognitive load, Fmr1-/y mice displayed attentional deficits that were dissociable from their enhanced tactile sensitivity. Together, our findings reveal that cognitive context critically shapes sensory phenotypes in autism. They advocate for a shift beyond traditional sensory-cognitive dichotomies to better capture the dynamic interplay between perceptual and cognitive alterations in autism.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Sex hormones testosterone and estradiol have been related to children's language development. The shared precursor hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), however, has not yet been considered as a biological marker of language ability, despite emerging evidence that fetal DHEA plays a critical role in the organization of the neonatal brain. The present study investigated whether fetal DHEA, compared to fetal testosterone, is associated with infant language development. Design and methods. DHEA and testosterone concentrations were measured in newborn hair strands (n = 56) collected two weeks after birth, capturing fetal long term hormone secretions during the third trimester of pregnancy. At six months of age, children's language abilities were assessed using the German version of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Results. Linear regression analysis revealed fetal DHEA levels to be significantly associated with language abilities at six months of age, with lower DHEA levels corresponding to higher language scores. Control analyses assessing general cognitive abilities showed no association of fetal DHEA levels with infant cognitive function. Testosterone levels were not associated with language nor general cognitive skills. Conclusions. The current study identifies fetal DHEA levels extracted from newborn hair samples as a potential biological factor influencing infant language development.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Here we use zebrafish to dissect DTG toxicity during early vertebrate development. DTG exposure from 2-4 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 24 hpf produced high mortality and abnormal morphology; co-treatment with folic acid or 5-methyltetrahydrofolate partially restored normal morphology, whereas calcium had no effect. Strikingly, supplementation with magnesium (Mg) rescued DTG-exposed embryos almost as effectively as folate, implicating magnesium availability in protection. In competitive binding assays, Mg increased binding of folate to purified folate receptor (FOLR1) by 30% in the presence of DTG. Maternal-zygotic zebrafish folr1 mutant embryos contained significantly less endogenous folate than wild-type embryos yet displayed marked hypersensitivity to DTG that could not be mitigated by folate supplementation. Together, these findings reveal a dual mechanism in which DTG antagonizes FOLR1 while concurrently sequestering Mg. Excess Mg converts DTG into a Mg-bound DTG complex that can no longer antagonize FOLR1, thereby restoring normal development. Our work identifies magnesium status as a modifiable determinant of DTG teratogenicity and provides a proof-of-concept zebrafish model that could be adapted for rapid in vivo screening of integrase inhibitors for developmental phenotypes.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we combined ChIP-seq for epigenetic marks with RNA-seq on eye tissue from wild-type embryos and Rdh10-/- embryos that exhibit failure in optic cup formation. We identified a small number of genes with decreased expression when RA is absent that also have decreased presence of a nearby epigenetic gene activation mark (H3K27ac). One such gene was Alx1 that also has an RA response element (RARE) located near the RA-regulated H3K27ac mark, providing strong evidence that RA directly activates Alx1. In situ hybridization studies showed that Rdh10-/- embryos exhibit a large decrease in eye Alx1 expression.

Here, we identify adult Drosophila immune cells-hemocytes-as key mediators of the muscle injury response. Following damage, hemocytes are rapidly recruited to affected fibers, where they perform dual functions. First, they promote tracheal (respiratory cell) branching by depositing the FGF ligand Branchless (Bnl) along damaged muscle, which activates its receptor, FGFR/Breathless (Btl), on tracheal cells, stimulating their outgrowth toward the injury and supporting oxygen delivery. Second, hemocytes contribute to structural stabilization by supplying key extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including SPARC and Collagen IV, to the damaged fiber.

D.; Michael, W. M.", "abstract": "In C. elegans, if embryos hatch into an environment lacking nutrients the primordial germ cells (PGCs) will arrest mRNA transcription and enter quiescence until food becomes available. Our previous work had shown that the global transcriptional silencing (GTS) that occurs in PGCs during L1 starvation requires a hyperdeposition of the repressive histone mark H3K9me3 in germline chromatin. Hyperdeposition is defined as an increase in the amount of H3K9me3 embedded in germline chromatin, relative to neighboring somatic nuclei. Hyperdeposition initiates in embryonic PGCs and is maintained in starved L1s. Here, we show that the nuclear RNAi pathway is responsible for both initiation and maintenance of H3K9me3 hyperdeposition. Interestingly, both known nuclear Argonautes, HRDE-1 and NRDE-3, play a role in hyperdeposition and they do so in a sequential manner. We show that HRDE-1 acts in embryonic PGCs to initiate hyperdeposition and then, at the embryo-to-L1 transition, HRDE-1 becomes dispensable and NRDE-3 is required to maintain H3K9me3 levels, and for GTS. We also examine the timing of H3K9me3 hyperdeposition and find that it initiates soon after germline zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs. Our data suggest a model where ZGA promotes both gene expression and H3K9me3 deposition at active loci, and under starvation conditions these H3K9me3 marks are employed to silence the germline genome.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

ZC4H2 consists of a coiled coil, and a single novel zinc finger with four cysteines and two histidines from which the protein gets its name. Alpha Fold 3 confidently predicts a structure for the zinc finger but also for similarly sized random sequences, providing equivocal information on its folding status. We show using a synthetic peptide fragment that the zinc finger of ZC4H2 is genuine, and folds around zinc ion with picomolar affinity. NMR pH titration of histidines and UV-Vis of a cobalt complex of the peptide indicate its four cysteines coordinate zinc while two histidines do not participate in binding. The experimental NMR structure of the zinc finger has a novel structural motif similar to RANBP2 zinc fingers, in which two orthogonal hairpins each contribute two cysteines to coordinate zinc. Most of the nine ZARD mutations that occur in the ZC4H2 zinc finger likely perturb this structure. While the ZC4H2 zinc finger shares the folding motif and cysteine-ligand spacing of the RANBP2 family, it is missing key substrate-binding residues. Unlike the NZF branch of the RANBP2 family, the ZC4H2 zinc finger does not bind ubiquitin. Since the ZC4H2 zinc finger occurs in a single copy it is also unlikely to bind DNA.

We unveil three distinct migration modes: gripping, slipping, and stick-slip. Notably, stiffness sensing occurs exclusively in the stick-slip mode, which requires a low substrate stiffness and a minimum actin polymerization speed as necessary conditions. Intriguingly, the optimal substrate stiffness that maximizes the migration speed is inversely proportional to the actin polymerization speed. Moreover, the maximal speed only depends on the nature of the clutch molecules, independent of substrate properties.

G.; Unterwald, E.; Stern, D.; Petrilli Fortuna, R.; Osei-Abrefa Ayensu, K.", "abstract": "Background The use of methamphetamine has continued to rise in the US. In addition to facilitating dopamine neurotransmission, methamphetamine indirectly increases glutamate release which activates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Ketamine is a noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist. Ketamine also has actions on -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and promotes synaptogenesis. Thus, we hypothesized that ketamine may be a potential therapeutic to reduce methamphetamine-seeking behaviors and associated negative affect in a rat model. Methods Male and female rats underwent methamphetamine or saline intravenous self-administration for 10 sessions, followed by extinction training. Rats received ketamine or saline treatment either prior to 10 daily extinction sessions or only prior to the last extinction session. Anxiety-like behaviors were measured 24 hours after extinction, followed by cue-induced and drug-primed reinstatement two and six days later respectively. Results Methamphetamine withdrawal increased anxiety-like behaviors in male rats on the elevated plus maze test compared to rats that self-administered saline. Moreover, anxiety-like behaviors were significantly attenuated by daily ketamine treatment during extinction. Drug-primed but not cue-induced reinstatement, tested six days after the last extinction session, was significantly attenuated in male rats that received ten or one ketamine treatments during extinction compared with rats receiving vehicle during extinction. Ketamine was ineffective in female rats in reducing cue-induced or drug-primed reinstatement. Conclusions Ketamine may confer sex-specific benefits during methamphetamine withdrawal and relapse vulnerability, particularly by reducing anxiety-like behaviors and attenuating drug-primed reinstatement in males. These results support the potential of ketamine as a targeted adjunct therapy during early methamphetamine abstinence in males.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Using the Drosophila brain, we discover a striking enrichment of peroxisomes in the neuronal soma and the cortex glia that enwrap them. Unexpectedly, import of peroxisomal proteins into cortex glia, but not neurons, dramatically oscillated across time and peaked in the early morning. Rhythmic peroxisomal import in cortex glia autonomously required the circadian clock and Peroxin 5 (Pex5; peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 homolog), with endogenous Pex5 protein peaking in the morning. Notably, removing Pex5 in cortex glia severely reduced sleep while concomitantly causing aberrant lipid metabolism characterized by ectopic lipid droplets and increases across multiple lipid families. Thus, the circadian import of peroxisomal proteins via Pex5 in cortex glia is essential for lipid homeostasis and organismal behavior.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproate (VPA) is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including congenital malformations and autism spectrum disorder. In animal models and neural organoids, VPA has been shown to alter signaling pathways, such as Wnt pathway, providing insights into VPA-induced neurodevelopmental defects. Here, we exposed dorsal forebrain organoids to VPA for 30 days and examined effects at the tissue, cellular, and molecular level. VPA treatment disrupted ventricular-like regions, indicating defects in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. Transcriptomics analysis confirmed altered expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and single cell RNA sequencing analysis identified genes involved in microenvironment sensing, such as cellular mechanosensing and Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway. Finally, proteomics analysis corroborated that VPA alters the microenvironment of the human dorsal forebrain organoids by disrupting the secretion of ECM proteins. Altogether, our study suggests that VPA-treated dorsal forebrain organoids serve as a model to investigate the role of extracellular processes in brain development and to understand how their disruptions might contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Kappa opioid receptors (kORs) play a critical role in mediating stress responses. Our previous studies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) demonstrated that acute stress activates kORs to block long-term potentiation at GABAA synapses on dopamine neurons (LTPGABA) and triggers stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Here we identify the specific GABAergic afferents affected by stress, the precise localization of kORs within the VTA, and show that VTA kOR activation is sufficient to drive reinstatement.\n\nWe optogenetically activated specific GABAergic afferents and found that nucleus accumbens (NAc)-to-VTA, but not lateral hypothalamus (LH)-to-VTA projections, exhibit stress-sensitive LTPGABA. Using a conditional knock-out approach, we found that selectively deleting kORs from NAc neurons but not from dopamine cells prevents stress-induced block of LTPGABA. Selectively activating dynorphin-containing NAc neurons with an excitatory DREADD mimics acute stress, preventing LTPGABA at VTA synapses. We furthermore demonstrated that without acute stress, microinjection of a selective kOR agonist directly into the VTA facilitates cocaine reinstatement without similarly affecting sucrose-motivated responding, demonstrating the critical role of kORs in stress-induced cocaine reinstatement.\n\nOur results show that kORs on GABAergic NAc nerve terminals in the VTA underlie loss of LTPGABA that may drive stress-induced addiction-related behaviors. Our work highlights the importance of inhibitory inputs for controlling dopamine neuron excitability in the context of addiction and contributes to defining the circuit involved in stress-induced drug reinstatement.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

We have previously demonstrated anxiety-like behavioral symptoms in the zebrafish model of TSC, which were rescued by treatment with the TrkB antagonist ANA-12. Here, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of how ANA-12 regulates behavior by analyzing brain activity in the telencephalon of TSC zebrafish larvae, and we identified the affected regions as corresponding to the known mammalian circuitry involved in anxiety processing. Due to differences in development, the identification of telencephalic territories that are homologous between zebrafish and mammals remains challenging, particularly at early, dynamic stages of development. However, we were able to identify populations of neurons in the zebrafish habenula and ventral subpallium whose involvement in anxiety parallels that of mammals. Those regions were dysregulated in the TSC mutant. This dysregulation correlated with aberrant anxiety behavior and was rescued by treatment with ANA-12. Our results suggest that hyperactivation of TrkB in those regions is a major contributor to anxiety-like behavior as seen in TSC fish, and that those mechanisms could be evolutionarily conserved between zebrafish and mammals.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Male rats were divided into 3 groups: Secure-chow (SC), a control group given 100% of daily caloric needs, distributed evenly across 4 daily meals of standard chow at set mealtimes; Secure-mixed (SM), a 2nd control group identical to the SC group except that the food type predictably alternated daily between chow and a high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFHS); and Insecure-mixed (IM), the experimental group given randomly alternating daily access to either chow or HFHS at either 85% or 115% of daily caloric needs, distributed evenly across 3 daily meals with unpredictable mealtimes. These feeding schedules were implemented from postnatal days (PNs) 26-45, after which all groups received chow ad libitum. Metabolic assessments performed in adulthood revealed no group differences in caloric intake, body weight, or body composition when maintained on either chow (PN46-149) or a cafeteria diet (PN150-174). Behavioral measures (PN66-126) revealed no group differences in anxiety-like, exploratory, or impulsive behavior (zero maze, open field, differential reinforcement of low rates of responding procedures).

With novel therapeutics targeting both the lysosomal and mitochondrial functions, robust assays for compound screening are becoming critical to evaluate modulation of both organelles in disease-relevant cellular models. Here, we investigated human fibroblasts derived from healthy donors, as well as patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, to assess their capacity to model key aspects of lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction. Lysosomal function was evaluated using various assays, including quantification of lysosomal proteins (TMEM175 and LAMP1), LysoTracker staining, measurement of lysosomal pH, and lysosomal enzymatic activity. Autophagic flux was assessed by measuring p62 levels as a marker of autophagy. Mitochondrial function was investigated by measuring mitochondrial calcium levels, membrane potential, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial content using MitoTracker. To explore the potential of using human fibroblasts for in vitro compound screening, we validated these assays in a 384-well high-throughput format using compounds such as chloroquine and ammonium chloride. Our findings demonstrate that human fibroblasts faithfully recapitulate lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunctions characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases.

We tailor this model to simulate both motor imagery task and resting state. We apply this approach to a cohort of 19 healthy subjects trained along four sessions where magnetoencephralography(MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were simultaneously recorded.

Numerous strategies have been explored to overcome this blockade, among others, molecular interventions or modulation of the inhibitory extracellular environment. Despite some advances, effective regeneration remains elusive, particularly in adult CNS neurons. To investigate these mechanisms in a controlled and reproducible setting, we employ organotypic slice cultures (OSCs), which retain key structural and cellular features of the intact brain while allowing for long-term in vitro experimentation. In particular, the entorhino-hippocampal (EH) co-culture model preserves the anatomical and functional connectivity of the perforant pathway, providing an excellent platform for studying axonal degeneration and regeneration. This model reproduces laminar specificity, axonal myelination, and inhibitory signaling after axotomy, closely mimicking in vivo conditions. Furthermore, EH co-cultures facilitate the application of optogenetic tools to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity. Our study explores whether enhancing activity in entorhinal cortex neurons can promote axonal regeneration after a EH lesion. Our results show that increased activity in entorhinal neurons alters the development of the EH connection and fails to enhance the regrowth of injured mature entorhinal axons.

To reveal the link between trial-by-trial {beta}-bursting and inhibition, we applied a recently developed analysis framework combining linear mixed-effects modelling (LMM) with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) during response inhibition and initiation in older adults. Twenty healthy older adults performed a bimanual anticipatory response inhibition task, while electroencephalography and electromyography were recorded to capture {beta}-activity ({beta}-burst rate/duration; averaged {beta}-power) and muscle bursting dynamics, respectively. Our analysis revealed distinct {beta}-bursting signatures absent in averaged {beta}-power data.

In this study, we assessed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on 29 participants with MitoD and 62 matched controls during resting state and tasks probing cognitive (N-back task), affective (cold pain), and sensory (multisensory visual and auditory perception) functions. MitoD individuals exhibited significant cognitive deficits across a range of functions, including executive function and working memory, mental and physical fatigability, low exercise tolerance, and low mood. These deficits were accompanied by markedly elevated blood levels of metabolic stress markers, including GDF15 and FGF21. Surprisingly, overall BOLD fMRI activity and connectivity were largely intact across all tasks in MitoD individuals. However, those with more severe cognitive impairment and higher GDF15 levels showed reduced working memory-related activity, which in turn mediated poorer task performance.

How does value-related information processed in other parts of the brain affect the responses of these different subtypes of SC neurons to facilitate faster saccades? To test this, we recorded four subtypes of neurons simultaneously while the monkey made saccades to objects they had been extensively trained to associate with large or small rewards (i.e., good or bad). In three subtypes of neurons (visual, visuomotor, and motor), the good objects elicited more spikes than bad objects. More importantly, using a bootstrapping procedure, we identified three separable phases of activity: 1) early visual response (EVIS), 2) late visual response (LVIS), and 3) pre-saccadic (PreSAC) motor response in these neuronal subtypes. In each subtype of neurons, the value of objects (good vs. bad) was positively correlated with the activity in the LVIS and PreSAC phases but not the EVIS phase. These data suggest that the value information from other brain regions modulates the visual (LVIS) and the motor (PreSAC) responses of visual, visuomotor, and motor neurons. This enhanced activation facilitates the faster initiation and execution of the saccade based on the value of each object. In addition, we found a novel class of tonically active neurons that decrease their activity in response to object onset and remain inhibited till the end of the saccade. We suggest that these tonic neurons facilitate the saccade to objects by disinhibiting the interactions between the other three SC neurons.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Visceral pain as unconditioned stimulus (US) was paired with a visual cue as conditioned stimulus (CS+) while another cue (CS-) remained unpaired. Differential neural responses to predictive cues were analyzed using a full factorial model and regression analyses to evaluate the predictive value of neural activation patterns based on contingency awareness.

This mutation leads to rhodopsin (RHO) misfolding, its retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and aggregation with wild-type (WT) RHO, ultimately triggering ER stress and photoreceptor degeneration. These aggregates are primarily cleared via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, with valosin-containing protein (VCP) playing a key role in their retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of VCP has shown neuroprotective effects in other models of adRP, but the poor aqueous solubility of VCP inhibitors and challenges in retinal drug delivery hinders clinical translation. To overcome these limitations, we evaluated and compared three VCP-targeted therapeutic strategies in Rho{triangleup}I255 knock-in mouse retinae: (1) small-molecule inhibitors (ML240, NMS-873) solubilized in DMSO, (2) ML240 encapsulated in monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG)-cholane nanoparticles, and (3) small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting VCP, delivered via magnetic nanoparticles.

Two groups of ferrets performed Go-NoGo auditory categorization tasks with opposite contingencies and rewards, and varied stimuli. Remarkably, despite the opposite stimulus-action associations, single-unit responses were similar across all tasks, being more sustained and stronger to (Target) sounds signaling a change in action, than to (Reference) sounds indicating maintenance of ongoing actions, especially during task engagement. Three major dynamic response profiles were extracted from the overall responses, and their combination defined separate neuronal clusters that exhibited different roles in relation to task events. Decoding based on the temporal structure of the population responses revealed distinct decoders that were aligned to different task events. Furthermore, the {beta}-band power, extracted from the FC local field potentials, was similarly and strongly modulated during Target stimuli in all tasks despite opposite behavioral actions. Based on these findings, we propose a model of pathway-specific functional projections from the tripartite FC neuronal clusters to the basal ganglia that is consistent with previous evidence for the conjoint roles of the FC and striatum in adaptive motor control.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Notwithstanding their utility, circuit models do not provide a unified framework encompassing the variety of effects observed experimentally. We develop a novel, alternative framework that recasts sensory operators in the language of intrinsic geometry. We start from a plausible representation of perceptual processes that is akin to measuring distances over a sensory manifold. We show that this representation is sufficiently expressive to capture a wide range of empirical effects associated with elementary sensory computations. The resulting geometrical framework offers a new perspective on state-of-the-art empirical descriptors of sensory behavior, such as first-order and second-order perceptual kernels. For example, it relates these descriptors to notions of flatness and curvature in perceptual space.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

We evaluate performance across six visual tasks, six electrode configurations, and two artificial vision models, positioning our CVP approach as a scalable pre-implantation method. Several chosen tasks align with the Functional Low-Vision Observer Rated Assessment (FLORA), revealing correspondence between model-predicted difficulty and real-world patient outcomes. Further, DNNs exhibited strong correspondence with psychophysical data collected from normally sighted subjects viewing phosphene simulations, capturing both overall task difficulty and performance variation across implant configurations. While performance was generally aligned, DNNs sometimes diverged from humans in which specific stimuli were misclassified, reflecting differences in underlying decision strategies between artificial agents and human observers.

Although important in studying vision quality, it has been overlooked in research on binocular and oculomotor vision. This study presents the construction of ocular torsion in the binocular system that incorporates the fovea displaced from the posterior pole and the lens tilted away from the eyes optical axis. When the eyes binocular posture changes, each eyes torsional position transformations, computed in the framework of Rodrigues vector, are visualized in GeoGebra simulations. Listings law, important in oculomotor control by constraining a single eye redundant torsional degree of freedom, is ab initio formulated for bifoveal fixations in the binocular system with misaligned optical components for the fixed upright head. It leads to the configuration space of binocularly constrained eyes rotations, including the noncommutativity rule. This formulation modifies the Listing plane of the straight-ahead eyes primary position by replacing it with the binocular eyes posture corresponding to the empirical horopters abathic distance fixation, a unique bifoveal fixation for which the longitudinal horopter is a straight frontal line. Notably, it corresponds to the eye muscles natural tonus resting position, which serves as a zero-reference level for convergence effort. Supported by ophthalmology studies, it revises the elusive neurophysiological significance of the Listing plane. Furthermore, the binocular constraints couple 3D changes in the eyes orientation and, hence, torsional positions during simulations with GeoGebras dynamic geometry. The binocular Listings law developed here can support this coupling, which is important in oculomotor control. The results obtained in this study should be a part of the answers to the questions posted in the literature on the relevance of Listings law to clinical practices.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying interoceptive attention by examining beta-band power suppression during heartbeat and auditory discrimination tasks. Fifty-one healthy participants engaged in interoceptive (heartbeat detection) and exteroceptive (auditory discrimination) tasks while their brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results revealed significant beta suppression time-locked to the R-peak in the somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, mid-cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 310 to 530 ms post-R-peak. Beta suppression was more pronounced during interoceptive attention, correlating positively with interoceptive accuracy. The findings support the notion that beta suppression in fronto-cingulo-somatosensory network may serve as a neural marker of interoceptive processing, contributing to predictive coding models of interoception. This study highlights the potential for using beta suppression as an objective measure of interoceptive accuracy and suggests that neural oscillations play a critical role in the brain's regulation of heartbeat-related information. Furthermore, the study proposes that interoceptive attention involves a top-down mechanism that dynamically adjusts the brain's response to cardiac afferent signals, enhancing the precision of interoceptive processing. These findings have implications for understanding how the brain integrates interoceptive signals and may provide insights into clinical applications targeting interoceptive dysfunctions.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Despite extensive progress, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AD remain incompletely understood, partially due to inadequate disease models. To illuminate the earliest changes in hereditary (familial) Alzheimers disease, we developed an isogenic AD cerebrocortical organoid (CO) model. Our refined methodology produces COs containing excitatory and inhibitory neurons alongside glial cells, utilizing established isogenic wild-type and diseased human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) carrying heterozygous familial AD mutations, namely PSEN1{Delta}E9/WT, PSEN1M146V/WT, or APPswe/WT. Our CO model reveals time-progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) species, loss of monomeric Tau, and accumulation of aggregated high-molecular-weight (HMW) phospho(p)-Tau. This is accompanied by neuronal hyperexcitability, as observed in early human AD cases on electroencephalography (EEG), and synapse loss. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses reveal significant differences in molecular abnormalities in excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons, helping explain AD clinical phenotypes. Finally, we show that chronic dosing with autophagy activators, including a novel CNS-penetrant mTOR inhibitor-independent drug candidate, normalizes pathologic accumulation of A{beta} and HMW p-Tau, normalizes hyperexcitability, and rescues synaptic loss in COs. Collectively, our results demonstrate these COs are a useful human AD model suitable for assessing early features of familial AD etiology and for testing drug candidates that ameliorate or prevent molecular AD phenotypes.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Social jetlag (adjusted for sleep debt (SJLSC) versus non-adjusted (SJL)), topological properties and intrinsic dynamics of resting-state networks, and morphometric characteristics were analyzed. Results: Over 35% of participants had SJLSC [&ge;]2.0 h. Boys, Hispanic and Black non-Hispanic youth, and/or those at later pubertal stages had longer SJLSC ({beta}=0.06 to 0.68, CI=[0.02, 0.83], p[&le;]0.02), which was also associated with higher BMI ({beta}=0.13, CI=[0.08, 0.18], p<0.01).

This task requires sophisticated neural integration of threat and safety cues to guide behavior. Yet little work has been conducted on threat and safety processing outside of conditioning paradigms, which, while valuable, lack the complexity to identify how the adolescent brain supports distinguishing threat from safety when both are present and as task contingencies change. In the current study, we take an approach that expands on elements of differential conditioning as well as conditioned inhibition. We recorded brain responses to external threat and self-oriented protection cues to examine how the adolescent brain supports threat-safety discrimination using 7-Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our findings reveal an adolescent transition in the neural mechanisms supporting accurate threat-safety discrimination, with younger adolescents (12-14 years) relying predominantly on the hippocampus and older adolescents (15-17 years) utilizing a more integrated circuit involving the hippocampus and anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) connectivity. Our results clarify how competition between threat and safety cues is resolved within the visual cortex, demonstrating enhanced perceptual sensitivity to protection that is independent of threat. By examining the dynamic encoding of safety to different stimuli, the current study advances our understanding of adolescent neurodevelopment and provides valuable insights into threat-safety discrimination beyond conventional conditioning models.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the first large-scale analysis of information-theoretic and topological HOI metrics, applied to both resting-state and task fMRI data from 100 unrelated subjects of the Human Connectome Project. We identify a clear taxonomy of HOI metrics - redundant, synergistic, and topological-, with the latter acting as bridges along the redundancy-synergy continuum. Despite methodological differences, all HOI metrics align with the brain's overarching unimodal-to-transmodal functional hierarchy. However, certain metrics show specific associations with the neurotransmitter receptor architecture. HOI metrics outperform traditional pairwise models in brain fingerprinting and perform comparably in task decoding, underscoring their value for characterizing individual functional profiles. Finally, multivariate analysis reveals that - among all HOI metrics - topological descriptors are key to linking brain function with behavioral variability, positioning them as valuable tools for linking neural architecture and cognitive function.

Aspr is dispensable for wing development but is strongly induced within 24 hours post-injury. Maintaining aspr expression inhibits differentiation and alters reparative growth, while loss impairs regeneration. Structural and expression analyses show Aspr is a membrane-associated extracellular protein secreted in extracellular vesicles (EVs), where it co-localizes with the WNT ligand Wingless (Wg). We find Aspr regulates post-injury but not developmental Wg signaling, potentially by influencing its secretion or availability via EVs. These findings suggest Aspr regulates WNT activity to ensure proper timing of cell fate specification during regeneration, revealing a mechanism by which signaling dynamics are temporally controlled during tissue repair.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

While human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can contribute to interspecies chimaeric embryos when injected into preimplantation embryos of mice, pigs, or monkeys, their integration is often limited due to low chimaerism and segregation from host tissues, significantly impeding progress toward exogenic organ generation. Here, we demonstrate that co-overexpression of the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 and the proto-oncogene MYCL, along with various cell cycle regulators significantly enhances human cell chimaerism by promoting cell proliferation. This strategy facilitates the generation of viable mouse pups containing hPSC-derived tissues without tumorigenesis. scRNA-seq analysis revealed that hPSCs already exit pluripotent by early post-implantation stage yet hPSCs with enhanced proliferation were able to integrate effectively into the cardiomyocytes and vasculature of both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues with gene expression profiles reflecting their structural integration.

Many organisms with symbiotic microorganisms have developed elaborate vertical transmission mechanisms, which are thought to be important for the evolution of intimate symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. One such case is the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis, in which the symbiotic bacteria have been evolutionarily conserved and co-speciated with the host insects with stable vertical symbiont transmission via ovarial passage. While classical histological descriptions and recent electron microscopic observations have reported the vertical symbiont transmission processes in some cockroach-Blattabacterium associations, the full picture of the infection dynamics has not been fully understood. In this study, we conducted detailed histological and cytological observations of the localization of the bacteriocytes and the symbiotic bacteria during the postembryonic development of the German cockroach Blattella germanica. We found that the symbiont-filled bacteriocytes migrate into and associate with nymphal ovaries and are subsequently eliminated from adult ovaries, suggesting that symbiont infection to the ovaries may only occur during nymphal stages. We also found that the symbiotic bacteria are localized in the space between each oocyte and surrounding follicle cells, the symbiont-localized space is interconnected between neighboring oocytes, and therefore the symbiotic bacteria can move across oocytes within the same ovariole, suggesting the possibility that the symbiont-infected oocytes may serve as the source of symbiont supply to developing young oocytes upstream in the same ovariole. Based on these observations, we provide a hypothesis as to how the postembryonic developmental dynamics of the bacteriocytes are integrated into the vertical symbiont transmission and functioning in the cockroach-Blattabacterium endosymbiosis.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

The motion alone is so informative that some animals can reconstruct the original shape. Jumping spiders, highly visual arthropods, divide motion detection and shape recognition between their four pairs of eyes. Previous studies showed that they can distinguish biological from non-biological motion using only their anterior lateral eyes, yet seemed unable to extract shape from motion. In this study, we examined how the anterior medial eyes of jumping spiders-which are used for shape recognition-respond to dot clouds depicting biological or non-biological motion. Using a custom eye tracker, we monitored retinal movements during presentation of static and moving stimuli. We found spiders change their retinal shifting pattern based on both the target's motion (biological or not) and implied structure (i.e., whether dots suggest a coherent shape).

Building upon the authors' previous hypothesis that certain vertebrate retinal cell nuclei act as microlenses, the optical model is extended in this work to the arthropod compound eye system. By conceptualizing the cornea, crystalline cones, and layered rhabdomeric nuclei as components of a \"multi-angle miniature real-image telescope,\" we construct a three-tiered imaging system composed of objectives, relay conjugate lenses, and microlenses. The model predicts that an ommatidium can actively perceive spatial depth and object distance by adjusting the focal length of crystalline cones and the distance between focused planes, thus achieving stereoscopic imaging with a single eye. Simulations based on representative species such as Drosophila melanogaster, Viggiani parasitic wasps, and fireflies (Lampyris) support the feasibility of this model in distance perception across scales ranging from microns to meters.

We applied Voxel-Based Morphometry, linear regression, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a cohort of 107 adults, including patients with gliomas in the language-dominant left hemisphere and healthy participants. Unlike previous studies, a subset of the clinical population was followed longitudinally for up to four months after oncological treatment, allowing us to describe the temporal progression of structural grey matter changes. Interestingly, a principal component model based on anomaly detection enabled robust differentiation between patients and controls. Patients exhibited significantly greater grey matter volume in the contralesional hemisphere compared to healthy participants, and these structural differences evolved over time, improving the model's AUC-ROC metrics. Although exploratory, a correlation analysis revealed that these structural changes were negatively associated with postsurgical cognitive performance. Together with the PCA findings, these results suggest that brain tumors induce extensive and dynamic adaptive mechanisms in the contralateral, unaffected hemisphere, likely reflecting altered patterns of structural covariance rather than simple regional volume increases. Understanding whether these changes could represent potential predictors of postoperative cognitive recovery is crucial for developing comprehensive clinical strategies.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

While MeCP2 is known to regulate chromatin, its impact on global histone composition and dynamics remains poorly understood.

Our analysis reveals striking neuron-specific differences in histone composition between Mecp2-deficient and wildtype (WT) mice. Interestingly, the expression of a pathogenic Mecp2 missense mutant (Y120D) results in subtler changes in histone composition that are distinct from the null mutations. This study provides the first spatially resolved epigenetic atlas of histone proteoforms in RTT and suggests that Mecp2 loss perturbs chromatin homeostasis in a neuron- and mutation-dependent manner.

Unlike humans, zebrafish possess the remarkable ability to regenerate lost retinal neurons through Muller glia (MG) reprogramming and asymmetric cell division to produce multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). While most studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying this regeneration process have focused on intracellular mechanisms, the role of the microenvironment surrounding retinal cells, the extracellular matrix (ECM), has been understudied. Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins, are principal components of the ECM basement membrane, and play important roles in vertebrate retinal development. Here, we examine the role of {beta}1b chain-containing laminins in the regenerative response of the zebrafish retina. We found that the zebrafish lamb1b gene is differentially expressed during MG reprogramming and MG and NPC proliferation during retinal regeneration. Further, we found that {beta}1b-containing laminins play important roles in regulating MG and NPC proliferation and neuroprotection of photoreceptors in light-damaged zebrafish retinas. Finally, Lam{beta}1b plays an important role in regulating the expression of integrin receptors and other laminin genes during the regeneration response.

S.; Goldreich, D.", "abstract": "Sensory perception often relies on the brain's integration of multiple noisy inputs (cues), a process known as cue combination. Cue combination within the sense of touch has been understudied. Here, we investigated whether humans optimally combine haptic cutaneous and hand configuration cues when discerning the size (e.g., diameter) of a disk held edge-on between the thumb and index fingers. When these two fingers span the diameter of a disk to contact its perimeter, a hand configuration cue (relating to the perceived distance between the fingers) provides information about the disk's size. Less obviously, cutaneous cues to disk size may be provided simultaneously from the indentation of the skin caused by the curvature of the disk (smaller disks cause greater indentation). It is unknown whether humans make use of all these cues when perceiving the size of the held object, and if so, whether they integrate the cues optimally. We considered three hypotheses for how humans might use these cues: they might rely solely on the least noisy cue (Winner-Take-All Model, WTA), combine cues based on a simple arithmetic average (Average-Measurement Model, AVG), or combine cues via an optimal weighted average (Optimally-Weighted Model, OPT). In three experiments involving 34 participants, we measured the reliabilities of these cues and compared participant performance to the predictions of the three models. Each experiment tested participants using a two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) paradigm with 3D printed disk stimuli. On each trial, under occluded vision, participants felt two disks sequentially and responded which felt larger. Participants were tested with each finger's cutaneous cue alone, the configuration cue alone, and all three cues together. In two experiments, the disks presented were circular. In a third experiment, unknown to participants, some of the presented disks were oval-like cue-conflict stimuli. The improvement of accuracy observed in multi-cue conditions over single-cue conditions, and the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) shifts observed in cue-conflict conditions, were consistent with optimal cue combination.

We evaluate the responses for both novelty and feasibility using automated GPT-based methods and analyze resting-state EEG prior to the test.

To address this, we utilized our previously established 3D cell-encapsulated ECM hydrogel to elucidate ONH astrocyte transcriptomic and cellular responses to varying biomechanical strain levels over time. Murine ONH astrocyte-encapsulated hydrogels were subjected to 0, 3, or 10% cyclic strain for 4h and 24h. Using confocal reflectance microscopy, we observed that hydrogel porosity was adequate for nutrient supplementation, while bulk hydrogel stiffness and cell viability remained unchanged after biomechanical strain. Mechanotranscriptional responses were robustly altered within 4h in a hydrogel region-, strain-, and time-dependent manner. RNA sequencing revealed changes in gene expression related to cell morphology, division, senescence, hypoxia, metabolism, and ECM regulation. Morphometric analyses of strained ONH astrocytes showed reduced F-actin area coverage, increased GFAP, HIF-1, fibronectin, and collagen fibril reorganization. Our findings demonstrate that ONH astrocyte transcriptional responses are highly dependent on duration/magnitude of biomechanical strain and surrounding ECM density, corresponding with altered cell morphology, hypoxia, and ECM modification.

These cues can be conditioned stimuli (CSs), which occur after drug intake and are paired with drug effects, and discriminative stimuli (DSs), which signal drug availability, regardless of ongoing drug-seeking behaviour. While projections from the infralimbic cortex (IL) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell are known to regulate CS-induced cocaine relapse, their role in DS-triggered relapse is not known. To investigate this, we examined how activating IL[-&gt;]NAc shell projections influences relapse driven by DSs and CSs during abstinence from intermittent cocaine use. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received viral-mediated gene expression of excitatory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs in the IL. Rats then self-administered cocaine during 12 intermittent-access sessions (5-min cocaine ON/25-min cocaine OFF, 4h/day). A discrete light (DS+) signalled drug-available periods, while a different light (DS-) signalled drug non-availability. During each DS+ period, cocaine infusions were paired with a compound light-tone (CS+). Four weeks later, rats were tested for cue-induced cocaine seeking following response-independent presentation of DS+, CS+ or both. Immediately prior to testing, rats received intra-NAc shell clozapine N-oxide or aCSF to activate IL terminals. DS+ alone and DS+/CS+ combined triggered greater cocaine seeking than did the CS+. Activation of IL[-&gt;]NAc shell projections suppressed relapse behaviour in DS+ and DS+/CS+ conditions. These findings highlight the distinct and powerful influence of DSs on relapse and identify the IL[-&gt;]NAc shell circuit as a promising target for relapse prevention.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

In contrast, the role of ungulate community composition in shaping short-distance dispersal and generating spatial patterns in the distribution of plant diaspores remains largely unexplored-- key questions addressed in this study. We conducted fieldwork at two adjacent grassland sites in Donana National Park (southwestern Spain). One site was used by a mixed community of four ungulate species--both wild and domestic (deer, wild boar, cattle, and horses)--while the other was used almost exclusively by deer. Our results revealed clear differences between sites in the total number of dispersed herbaceous seeds and the most frequently dispersed plant families. Within the four-species community, cattle and deer differed most in the taxonomic composition of the seeds they dispersed, suggesting that herbivore-specific seed selection and dispersal act as key drivers of grassland structure at fine spatial scales, mirroring dynamics typically observed at broader scales. Moreover, only in the four-ungulate community did we detect significant spatial patterns in seed dispersal. These included positive effects of short-distance feces aggregation, spatial covariance in seed content among nearby feces, and a strong correlation between seed content and local feces density. Seed families predominantly dispersed by cattle also exhibited significant spatial structuring.

Nine hornbills were presented with three string configurations of increasing complexity: parallel (baseline), broken (contact/no-contact), and crossed strings. Subjects reliably selected the correct string in the baseline and contact conditions, demonstrating sensitivity to physical continuity cues. In contrast, accuracy declined significantly in the crossed condition, which required recognition of spatial displacement between the baited and accessible string ends. Reaction time (RT) analyses revealed prolonged latencies in the crossed condition, likely reflecting increased cognitive demands or limited habituation. Individuals who failed often adopted suboptimal strategies, such as proximity or side biases. We also observed lateralisation effects, with a left-side RT advantage, suggesting hemispheric specialisation.

Central tendency indicates that reproductions are biased toward the mean of the stimulus distribution. Serial dependence reflects that the reproduction of the current stimulus is influenced by the previous stimulus. Although these biases are well-documented, their origins remain to be determined. Studies on duration reproduction suggest that autocorrelation within a stimulus sequence may play a role. In this study, we explored whether the level of autocorrelation in a stimulus sequence affects central tendency and serial dependence in vestibular path integration. Participants (n = 24) performed a vestibular distance reproduction task in total darkness by actively replicating a passively moved stimulus distance with a linear motion platform. We compared two conditions: a high-autocorrelation condition, where stimulus distances followed a random walk, and a no-autocorrelation condition, where the same distances were presented in a randomly shuffled order. We quantified both biases using two approaches: separate simple linear regressions and a joint multiple linear regression model that accounts for the autocorrelation in the stimulus sequence. Simple linear regressions revealed that central tendency was weaker and serial dependence reversed in the high-autocorrelation condition compared to the no-autocorrelation condition. However, these differences were no longer observed in the multiple linear regression analysis, indicating that these biases were independent of the specific stimulus sequence protocol. We conclude that these perceptual biases in vestibular path integration persist regardless of stimulus autocorrelation, suggesting that they reflect robust strategies of the brain to process vestibular information in self-motion perception.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

However, some MHC-I allotypes can select high affinity binding peptides independently of tapasin, and the molecular mechanism(s) for such peptide editing are unknown. Here, we used enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of peptide-deficient MHC-I to investigate tapasin-independent peptide editing. Our simulations revealed transient disruption of hydrogen bonds between MHC-I and the peptide backbone could allow for peptide editing, a process we term \"active displacement\". Destabilisation of interactions with the peptide backbone, necessitates sequence-specific sidechain interactions to maintain peptide binding. Our active displacement model predicts surface expression levels for multiple MHC-I allotypes and accounts for the presentation of an immunogenic mutant KRAS-G12D neoepitope by HLA-C*08:02, but not by closely related HLA-C*05:01.

A major challenge in their purification process lies in effectively isolating such spherical minicells (<1 um) from their rod-shaped parental cells (1-10 um). This study investigates the use of Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) microfluidic systems for minicell purification, leveraging Two-Photon Lithography (TPL) for the rapid prototyping of high-resolution designs optimized for this purpose. Under laminar flow conditions, we investigated key DLD design parameters including symmetric and asymmetric post gaps, outlet widths, dual post arrays, fluidic-resistance-optimized design. To enhance separation efficiency, we developed a two-stage microfluidic separation system combining a spiral inertial chip and an optimized DLD chip in series. Utilizing high-resolution TPL for chip fabrication of an inertial chip with 12 spirals and an asymmetric DLD chip with a 2 um downstream post gap, we achieved a separation efficiency of 94%. This high efficiency achieved using microfluidics for the separation of cells differing in both shape and size, demonstrates the potential of advanced microfluidic systems in cell sorting.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

P.; Fiszbein, A.", "abstract": "Alternative RNA processing is a key regulator of gene expression, driving transcript and proteomic diversity essential for cell function. However, the precise impacts of different alternative RNA processing events on protein function remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce SpliceImpactR, an open-source tool that systematically identifies RNA isoform switches, including alternative first and last exons, exon skipping, intron retention, hybrid exons, and splice site variation, across the human transcriptome, and predicts their impact on encoded proteins. We find that intron retention and hybrid exons frequently alter the coding potential of transcripts. Strikingly, when both isoforms remain protein-coding, 87% of alternative RNA processing events result in substantial changes to the protein sequence. Among these, alternative last exons drive the largest changes, frequently disrupting protein-protein interactions. Across human tissues, alternative first exons drive the largest relative changes in proteins, often resulting in tissue-specific protein domains. Notably, frameshifts introduced by alternative splicing are often rescued by co-regulated alternative downstream exons, suggesting a buffering mechanism in isoform regulation. Moreover, we show that alternative splicing exhibits gradual, tissue-specific variation, rather than binary on/off behavior, enabling conserved regulation of protein domains across tissues. Together, our results provide a proteome-wide view of splicing regulation, uncovering widespread, context-dependent impacts of alternative splicing on the human proteome.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

In particular, altered levels of mature microRNA-31 (miR-31) has been linked to a variety of different cancers. Targeting functionally relevant sites of the precursor structure of miR-31 with small molecules offer a strategy to regulate miR-31 maturation. Herein we describe a virtual screening approach to explore the druggability of the precursor structure of microRNA-31 (pre-miR-31). We used a structure-guided approach to virtually screen a fragment library and followed up with experimental characterization of top-ranking candidates, leading to the identification of several compounds that bound to pre-miR-31. Further characterization of the RNA-ligand complexes by heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy revealed three compounds bound pre-miR-31 at the Dicer cleavage site, suggesting that these compounds may function to inhibit Dicer processing. Using these initial hits, we performed chemical structure similarity searches and identified additional binders of pre-miR-31 that had equivalent or enhanced binding relative to the parent compounds. These studies suggest a generalizable approach by which RNA-binding ligands can be identified from large chemical databases.

Therefore, additional research is needed into combination therapies that could preferentially radiosensitize cancer cells compared to surrounding healthy tissue without causing deleterious side effects.

Here, we show that transient (2 hour) trichostatin A (TSA) treatment of cancerous and non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell lines increases immediate DNA damage and decreases long-term cell survival in both cell types at high radiation doses. At an intermediate radiation dose (1 Gy), however, TSA treatment selectively radiosensitizes the cancer as compared to the non-cancer cell line. The radiosensitizing action of short-term TSA treatment, which by itself has no impact on cell viability, suggests that chromatin decompaction is an important part of the mechanism of radiosensitization by HDACis.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Both of these drugs have been widely shown to decrease food intake in both humans and pre-clinical models, and although amphetamine and nicotine clearly affect food intake under normal baseline ( homeostatic) conditions, there has been limited examination of the ability of these drugs to affect reward-related ( hedonic) aspects of feeding. Furthermore, there are sex differences in the behavioral responses to both drugs, but it is unclear if these sex differences also translate to their effects on feeding. This study examined whether nicotine and amphetamine regulate sucrose intake in a food self-administration paradigm in a sex-dependent manner across both fixed and progressive schedules of reinforcement. Amphetamine reduced operant responding for sucrose pellets and decreased acute intake of sucrose during ad libitum free-feeding access in a dose-dependent manner, whereas nicotine reduced sucrose self-administration and free intake only at higher doses that also impaired locomotor activity in open field tests. The effects of both amphetamine and nicotine did not differ by sex for either drug. Overall, these results suggest that the mechanisms mediating the addictive qualities of these drugs and their appetite suppressing effects may be distinct and therefore could be a potential target for future obesity therapeutics.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Objective: To illuminate disease mechanisms and translational value of two commonly utilized rat models of synucleinopathy - AAV-delivered human mutant hA53T alpha synuclein (a-Syn) and a-Syn preformed fibril (PFF) injection - using a top-down, unbiased, large-scale approach. Methods: Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry (TMT-MS), RNA sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses were used to assess proteins, genes, and pathways disrupted in rat striatum and substantia nigra. Comparative analyses were performed with PD drug candidate targets and an existing human PD and dementia with Lewy body (DLB) proteomics dataset. Results: Unbiased proteomics identified 388 proteins significantly altered by hA53T-a-Syn and 1550 by PFF-a-Syn compared to sham controls. Pathway and correlation analyses of these revealed common and distinct pathophysiological processes altered in each model: dopaminergic signaling/metabolism, mitochondria and energy metabolism, and motor processes were disrupted in AAV-hA53T-a-Syn, while immune response, intracellular/secretory vesicles, synaptic vesicles, and autophagy were more impacted by PFF-a-Syn. Synapses, neural growth and remodeling, and protein localization were prominently represented in both models. Analyses revealed potential biomarkers of disease processes and proteins and pathways also altered in patients, elucidating drug targets/ disease mechanisms the models best reflect.

Instead, modern ephys recordings are processed with automated methods that use waveform template matching to isolate putative single neurons. While scalable, automated methods are subject to assumptions that often fail to account for biophysical changes in action potential waveforms, leading to systematic errors. Consequently, manual curation of these errors, which is both time-consuming and lacks reproducibility, remains necessary. To improve efficiency and reproducibility in the spike-sorting pipeline, we introduce here the Spike-sorting Lapse Amelioration System (SLAy), an algorithm that automatically merges oversplit spike clusters. SLAy employs two novel metrics: (1) a waveform similarity metric that uses a neural network to obtain spatially informed, time-shift invariant low-dimensional waveform representations, and (2) a cross-correlogram significance metric based on the earth-movers distance between the observed and null cross-correlograms. We demonstrate that SLAy achieves ~ 85% agreement with human curators across a diverse set of animal models, brain regions, and probe geometries. To illustrate the impact of spike sorting errors on downstream analyses, we develop a new burst-detection algorithm and show that SLAy fixes spike sorting errors that preclude the accurate detection of bursts in neural data. SLAy leverages GPU parallelization and multithreading for computational efficiency, and is compatible with Phy and NeuroData Without Borders, making it a practical and flexible solution for large-scale ephys data analysis.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Recently, cryogenic electron microscopy structure of m3C methyltransferase METTL6 in complex with tRNASer and seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) was reported. Here, we employ multi-scale computer simulations to ascertain how METTL6, assisted by SerRS, identifies its tRNASer substrate and catalyzes m3C32 formation. We demonstrate SerRS acts by engaging tRNASer variable arm to create the interaction surface for METTL6 recruitment. Once METTL6 is appropriately docked at the tRNASer anticodon stem loop, the methylation reaction proceeds spontaneously.

We analysed 3,900 Klebsiella genomes from diverse ecological niches to identify prophage-encoded proteins mediating capsule tropism. We applied a genome-wide association study (GWAS) correlating prophage protein clusters (from 8,105 prophages) with confidently assigned bacterial K-loci. GWAS identified high-confidence predictors for 16 out of 35 most diverse K-loci, of which 14 were receptor-binding proteins (RBPs) belonging to classical depolymerases (n=6), SGNH hydrolases which deacetylate polysaccharides (n=6), and structurally novel RBPs (n=2). When we relaxed the filtering thresholds, we identified 26 putative depolymerases, of which 12 were deemed as strong predictions against 10 K-types. In parallel, 50 depolymerases manually found in prophages from the representative subset of 99 bacterial isolates, together with an additional 10 depolymerases based on GWAS predictions, were prepared as recombinant proteins and tested on a Klebsiella reference panel of 119 K-types. Most predicted prophage depolymerases (34/60) failed to yield soluble products, 6 were not active on the K-types panel, and 5/14 targeted a different K-type than their bacterial host, highlighting the unpredictability of prophages as a source of functional enzymes. A comparison of GWAS-predicted enzymes, from the manual search and from virulent phages showed that depolymerase specificity was often difficult to infer from sequence or structure alone. Our findings reveal that Klebsiella prophages encode structurally diverse RBPs, suggesting temperate phages may rely not only on depolymerisation but also on capsule modification--such as deacetylation--for infection. This suggests capsule diversity in K. pneumoniae may be substantially underestimated, with implications for phage specificity, competition and vaccine design.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Despite global prevalence, there are no established treatments for HAstVs due to a lack of understanding of the fundamental biology of infection, including mechanisms of viral replication and the functions of several viral nonstructural proteins. Like all positive-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses, infection induces remodeling of host membranes into replication organelles (ROs). However, the intracellular membrane source and viral proteins involved in the coordination of HAstV ROs remain poorly defined. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we determined that HAstV1 infection drives extensive restructuring of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to concentrate RNA replication and virus packaging. Long-term, time-lapse imaging of the ER and time point transmission electron microscopy revealed that temporal manipulation of ER membrane corresponds with the emergence of ER-contiguous double membrane vesicles (DMV). We found that the co-expression of transmembrane nonstructural proteins nsp1a/1 and nsp1a/2, which have not been previously implicated in membrane reorganization, established similar DMV networks in the absence of an active infection. Further, super resolution microscopy revealed the organization of these two viral proteins in RO-like arrangements within the perinuclear region of infected cells.

Angiotensin IV, but not angiotensin II, has recently been reported to enhance the binding between the viral spike protein and ACE2. To investigate the virological significance of this effect, we developed a single-round infection assay using SARS-CoV-2 viral-like particles expressing the spike protein. Our results demonstrate that while angiotensin II does not affect viral infectivity across concentrations ranging from 40nM to 400nM, angiotensin IV enhances viral entry at a low concentration but exhibits dose-dependent inhibition at higher concentrations. These findings highlight the unique dual role of angiotensin IV in modulating SARS-CoV-2 entry. In silico molecular docking simulations indicate that angiotensin IV was predicted to associate with the S1 domain near the receptor-binding domain in the open spike conformation.

Here we report on the functionality of truncated DivIVA proteins, using a unique divIVA deletion mutant created in cell wall-deficient Kitasatospora viridifaciens L-forms. DivIVA comprises an N-terminal domain, two coiled-coil regions separated by an intercoil linker, and a C-terminal domain. Deleting either the intercoil or the C-terminal region impacted branching dynamics. We also created a minimized variant wherein both were deleted simultaneously, containing the N-terminus and fused coiled-coils, resembling DivIVA from unicellular bacteria. Expression of this minimized variant resulted in severe growth defects. Cells exhibited a strong increase in hyphal width and cell wall thickness, accompanied by frequent tip bursting. Finally, we successfully introduced chimeric DivIVA from the unicellular actinobacterium Mycolicibacterium smegmatis with an N-terminal domain of Kitasatospora viridifaciens, demonstrating functional conservation within the phylum. In contrast, a chimeric DivIVA from Bacillus subtilis could not support growth, underscoring that polar growth is encoded within Actinomycetota-specific amino acid motifs encoded in the first and second coiled-coil.

Given the activation of the immune system during wound healing, and the known links between immunity and pigmentation, we hypothesized that the immune response triggered by wounding contributes to the formation of wound-induced ectopic eyespots on butterfly wings. We tested this hypothesis by wounding the wings of Bicyclus anynana pupae and modulating immune challenge levels with application of varying quantities of heat-killed bacteria. These led to up-regulation of defense-related genes in the wounded wing as well as in the contralateral non-wounded wing. Immune activation did not affect the likelihood of ectopic eyespot formation, but it did significantly influence the extent of pigmentation changes around injury sites: stronger immune activation produced larger ectopic eyespots. This effect was localized to the treated wing and did not affect contralateral, control wound-induced eyespots. Additionally, stronger immune challenges led to smaller overall wing size and to relatively smaller native eyespots. Our findings reveal that immune activation contributes to the development of wound-induced eyespots and impacts both pigmentation pattern formation and wing size regulation.

At present, all epigenetic clocks utilise C5-methylcytosine (5mC), a prevalent DNA methylation mark in vertebrates. However, in some species, 5mC marks are rare or even undetectable. Here, we describe epigenetic clocks based on N6-methyladenine (6mA), a DNA methylation mark whose role in aging has remained unexplored. Using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing, we measured genome-wide base-resolution levels of 6mA and 5mC in males of the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris (n = 24). We constructed a series of epigenetic clocks using age-specific patterns in 6mA or 5mC. For each clock, predicted epigenetic age and chronological age were highly correlated. Furthermore, we pharmacologically increased individual lifespan with pharmacological agents and showed that, for individuals whose lifespan had been pharmacologically increased, each clock predicted younger epigenetic age than chronological age, indicating that the clocks captured signals of biological aging. Our results demonstrate that 6mA patterns can be used to build epigenetic clocks that accurately predict both chronological and biological age in animals, paving the way toward the use of 6mA as a reliable biomarker of aging.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

However, despite the available transcriptomic data, no focused phylotranscriptomic study has been conducted to characterize the patterns of molecular evolution in this group. In this study, we leverage a dataset composed predominately of publicly available transcriptomes to infer relationships within Apocynaceae and explore the molecular processes that have shaped their divergences. Methods: We extracted nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genes from 47 publicly available and one newly sequenced transcriptome to assemble and infer species relationships across Apocynaceae. Leveraging the gene-rich nuclear phylotranscriptomic data, we inferred molecular dates and investigated the complex history of gene tree conflict, molecular rate shifts, and gene duplications. To investigate the genomic basis of adaptations, we analyzed the inferred 14,838 gene duplications at the base of Apocynaceae for shared functional enrichment of genes related to evolutionary innovations. Key Results: The Apocynaceae topology inferred from our phylotranscriptomic analysis is highly concordant with the current consensus. Notably, a genome-wide acceleration in molecular rate subtends the Ceropegieae tribe. We observed that a decreased time between divergences is associated with a higher rate of gene tree conflict, a pattern especially prevalent across the Apocynaceae's historically recalcitrant backbone relationships. Furthermore, gene duplications may underlie evolutionary innovations, such as immunity-related gene expansion in the genus Asclepias and duplications associated with trichome modifications in the epiphytic Hoya. Finally, we discuss the contentious history of whole-genome duplication (WGD) within the Apocynaceae and emphasize the need for further investigation into the placement of WGDs. Conclusions: Repurposing transcriptomes is a powerful means of accumulating data for novel insights in plant evolution, especially during uncertain funding and cases where budget restrictions exist. Leveraging this gene-dense dataset, we obtained novel insights into the molecular evolution of Apocynaceae and identified areas for future investigations.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Four resistant sources, namely, ICP20096, ICP20097, ICPL87119 and ICP13304 were identified as a resistance source for both FW and SMD. Total 12 markers from chromosome 11 for FW and 4 markers from chromosome 09 for SMD were validated using the KASP genotyping approach. We have identified resistant haplotypes for FW on chromosome 10 and 11 and for SMD on chromosome 09. Moreover, we have identified four InDels for FW on chromosome 5 in Two component response regulator gene (Cc_11098) and four InDels for SMD on chromosome 9 in genes, namely, LRR and NB-ARC domain disease resistance protein (Cc_21069), Flavonoid 3', 5'-hydroxylase (Cc_21070) respectively.

To address this critical research gap, we introduce the 16S-23S-5S rRNA Database, a meticulously curated and intuitive platform encompassing around 5000 complete bacterial and archaeal genomes. This database provides granular operon-level annotations, robust alignment data, quantitative copy number statistics, percent identity matrices, and predicted secondary structures for each rRNA component.

Crucially, the database systematically accounts for intragenomic heterogeneity, a factor paramount for accurate microbial classification and the inference of evolutionary trajectories. Our analysis reveals prevalent phyla such as Pseudomonadota (1,891 genomes), Actinomycetota (846 genomes), and Bacillota (773 genomes), with Bacillota exhibiting the highest average rRNA gene copy numbers.

Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) from probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a promising novel therapeutic with mechanisms holding potential to drive increased rates of durable disease remission, including immunomodulation and intestinal epithelial tissue repair. However, translation of these cell-secreted nanovesicles is limited by long standing biomanufacturing hurdles, especially low production yields due to low biogenesis rates from cells. Here, our goal was to identify a candidate probiotic LAB that produces BEVs effective in a preclinical mouse model of IBD, and then genetically engineer the LAB for at least 10-fold increased production yields of BEVs, thereby passing a critical production threshold. We identified Lactiplantibacillus plantarum as a candidate LAB producing BEVs effective in treating acute dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis, and with greater efficacy than BEVs from probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. We then genetically engineered a hypervesiculating L. plantarum strain by inducible expression of a peptidoglycan-modifying enzyme, resulting in a 66-fold increase in BEV productivity. Finally, we confirmed hypervesiculating L. plantarum BEVs were therapeutically effective in the acute DSS mouse model of colitis and found these BEVs were superior in reducing mucosal tissue damage compared to live L. plantarum cells.

Soil water potential, which regulates microbe-available water, is controlled by both osmotic and matric potential, which both increase as soils dry. While both parameters can independently increase water potential, the genetic mechanisms underlying microbial responses to both are unknown, with potentially different mechanisms available for soil microbes to respond to these hydrologic parameters. To explore microbial responses to matric versus osmotic potential shifts, we evaluated the growth and transcription of Variovorax beijingensis in soils and liquid cultures of varying water potential. We find this microbe respires in dilute minimal medium (-240 {+/-}104 kPa), in liquid medium supplemented with sucrose (-1323 {+/-}20.8 kPa), and in a pair of matrices that span a similar range of pressures (-183 {+/-}55 and -1393 kPa {+/-}200 kPa). We show that the global gene expression patterns vary significantly across all four conditions, even when the matric potential and osmotic pressure are set to similar values. However, the direction of gene expression changes correlated for 68% of the transcripts arising from an increase in osmotic pressure within liquid medium and an increase in matric potential within the different soils. While a large overlap was observed in the Variovorax transcriptional response to shifts in both osmotic and matric potential, the responses were not identical, with matric potential shifts leading to 2.55-fold more genes exhibiting differential expression.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

These changes reshape the skin ecological niche, influencing the skin mycobiome composition and behavior. Malassezia, a lipid-dependent human pathobiont and dominant fungal resident of skin, has been implicated in several dermatological disorders. We hypothesize that shifts in Malassezia populations contribute to post-menopausal skin disorders through altered host-microbe interactions. Results: Shotgun metagenomics of facial and scalp skin from 345 Asian women were stratified by menopausal stage (pre- [N=171], peri- [N=36], and post-menopausal [N=138]) and revealed the presence of seven out of the seventeen recognized Malassezia species: M. globosa, M. restricta, M. arunalokei, M. furfur, M. dermatis, M. japonica, and M. sympodialis. Detection frequencies of several species varied markedly across menopausal groups. Notably, M. globosa was detected 20% more frequently on the scalp of post- versus pre-menopausal women. Reduced sebum concentration on post-menopausal women skin correlated with increased M. globosa abundance. In vitro co-culture of keratinocytes with Malassezia spp. showed cells tolerated fungal loads up to 10. CFU/cm2, but severe cytotoxicity was observed at [&ge;]10. CFU/cm2. M. globosa elicited the highest cytotoxicity towards keratinocytes. All Malassezia spp. tested invaded keratinocytes and triggered strong pro-inflammatory responses. Notably, IL-1, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, IL-21, TNF-, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and MMP1 were significantly overproduced. Transcriptomics of keratinocytes exposed to toxic fungal loads revealed a gene expression profile characteristic of hyperproliferative and undifferentiated cells, alongside elevated expression of NLRP3, a key inflammasome sensor involved in pyroptosis. Conclusions: Menopause is associated with distinct shifts in Malassezia spp. prevalence and abundance. Reduced skin lipids and thickness may increase fungal burden relative to host cells, promoting inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Malassezia ability to invade keratinocytes suggests a mechanism for immune evasion and induction of chronic inflammation. Furthermore, keratinocytes exposed to high fungal loads exhibited a transcriptomic profile indicative of hyperproliferation and impaired differentiation, resembling patterns observed in psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and other inflammatory skin conditions. Our co-culture model provides mechanistic insight into Malassezia-driven skin inflammation and offers a platform to develop targeted therapies for post-menopausal skin disorders.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

We demonstrated that R. parkeri survives and proliferates within phagocytes and avoids intracellular killing within lysosomal compartments. We found that infection of human macrophage-like cells with a related SFG Rickettsia, R. conorii, resulted in a significant increase in mitochondria-associated proteins, suggesting that mitochondrial functions are involved in Rickettsia pathogenesis. Several intracellular bacterial pathogens manipulate host cell mitochondrial networks and stimulate mitochondrial fission mediated by a GTP-binding regulatory protein, DRP1/DMNL1, to promote intracellular replication. Here, we investigated the contribution of DRP1 in the growth of R. parkeri in macrophages. Murine immortalized bone marrow derived macrophages (iBMDMs) and primary human monocyte derived macrophages were infected with R. parkeri and mitochondrial dynamics (fission and network) were assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. R. parkeri proliferated in macrophages, which coincided with a significant increase in mitochondria content and fission compared to uninfected cells. R. parkeri infection led to increases in host cell ATP production primarily due to mitochondrial respiration and bacteria were often found co-localized with mitochondrial fragments. Importantly, R. parkeri growth was significantly impacted in DRP1 deficient macrophages. These results suggest that the modulation of mitochondria content and dynamics are essential for replication and survival of pathogenic SFG Rickettsia species in macrophages and suggest that the metabolic requirements for obligate intracellular pathogens may differ from other pathogenic Gram-negative intracellular bacteria.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Dispersions of 10% w/v pea protein were treated sing TG dosages of 0-10 U/g protein. Rheological measurements showed a significant increase in storage modulus (G') and altered gelation dynamics, with a clear dose-dependent relationship, indicating enhanced network formation. The content of free primary amino groups, quantified using the o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) method, decreased with higher TG levels, confirming progressive covalent crosslinking. SDS-PAGE further revealed differential participation of pea protein fractions in the crosslinking reaction. To elucidate molecular changes, proteomic profiling via LC-MS/MS was performed. The analysis indicated that glutamine and lysine residues located near glutamic acid or within disordered regions of peptides were preferentially crosslinked. Specific TG-catalyzed adducts were also identified and found to be enriched in disordered protein regions. Together, the findings demonstrate a clear mechanistic link between enzymatic crosslinking at the peptide level and functional alterations in network structure and viscoelastic properties.

They are able to infect a wide range of host plants belonging to the Poaceae family. The ban of neonicotinoids in Europe has resulted in an increasing disease incidence and triggered the need to better understand their emergence and spread. The ability of a Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) population to adapt to different hosts has never been studied. We performed an experimental evolution of two BYDV species (BYDV-PAS and BYDV-PAV) to study their adaptation to four Poaceae species (wheat, oat, two-row barley, and six-row barley). After four months of evolution (4 passages from plant to plant), the replicative fitness of the final viral populations was estimated, and the complete viral genomes were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing in pools of BYDV populations. Wildly divergent evolutionary trajectories were obtained, with stable or increased fitness, up to extinctions of viral populations within and among plant species. To understand these results, the composition of viral populations was analysed in detail using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling, clustering, and haplotype reconstruction methods. Interestingly, adaptation to oat and barley was mainly explained by a combination of BYDV-PAV haplotypes showing specific mutations. In contrast, adaptation to wheat was mainly explained by a combination of BYDV-PAS haplotypes harbouring specific mutations. Moreover, these local adaptations were associated to an adaptation cost in other hosts for some viral populations. The presence of adaptation costs in controlled but realistic conditions opens the door for evaluating practices such as crop mixtures or rotations on fields, as a means to mitigate the impact of BYDV.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Traditionally, these agents are chemically synthesized, which can involve complex, costly, and environmentally unfriendly processes. Here, we report a novel biocatalytic approach for the efficient, safe, and eco-friendly synthesis of 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrothymidine (5-MDHT), a potent Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI probe for imaging in vivo expression of the Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 Thymidine Kinase (HSV1-TK) reporter gene. We demonstrate that 5-MDHT can be biosynthesized via one- or two-step enzymatic reactions using human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (hPNPase) and the SgvMVAV SAM-dependent methyltransferase. hPNPase catalyzed the base-exchange reaction with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) between 138-316 s-1 M-1, while SgvMVAV methylation of 5,6-dihydrothymidine yielded 5-MDHT with a catalytic efficiency of 26 s-1 M-1. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the enzymatic binding and selectivity observed experimentally. The resulting 5-MDHT was validated using CEST-MRI, showing a distinct exchangeable imino proton signal at 5.3 ppm.

CagY is the T4SS backbone, connecting the bacterial cytoplasm with the epithelial cytoplasm and interacting with most other T4SS proteins. However, its mechanisms of action are unknown. We aimed to comprehensively analyse cagY in a worldwide collection of strains to unmask any correlation between ancestry and/or disease and sequence diversity, including an analysis of critical domains and associated structural changes. We used 674 cagY sequences derived from1,012 Hp genomes, sequenced with Single Molecule Real-Time from the Hp Genome Project. Phylogenetic and principal component analyses (PCA) revealed a strong population structure among European, Asian, African and American clusters, which interfered with other analyses. To address this heterogeneity, dimensional reduction analysis with PCA and Linear Discriminant Analyses were used to minimize interference before studying possible association of cagY diversity with disease. For this analysis, cagY genes were fragmented using unitig-caller with a designed analytical pipeline that clearly separated the non-atrophic gastritis (NAG), advanced intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer (GC) groups. Sixty-four unitigs significantly separated GC from NAG based on cagY sequences, and the most GC-associated unitigs were localized in the middle repeat region of the protein (MRR), particularly in the A module, including the cysteine-containing motif YLDCVSQ. Proline was enriched in the MRR and VirB10 regions. The consequences of the diversity on the protein structure were analysed using ChimeraX.

We reveal that the interplay between homotypic and heterotypic interactions among DNA, RNA and peptides dictates the formation of multiphase condensates.

ECA is found as the headgroup of a phospholipid and attached to LPS in the OM, and as a periplasmic cyclic form (ECACYC). WzyE polymerizes ECA repeat units to form the ECA chain with final chain length regulated by WzzE, a class 1 polysaccharide co-polymerase (PCP1). PCP1 function studies have shown interaction of the PCP1 transmembrane helices with the polymerase and a secondary activity found in the periplasmic domain of the PCP1 are required for chain-length regulation. However, WzzE is also necessary for ECACYC biosynthesis, and it remains unclear why loss of WzzE prevents ECACYC production but not linear ECA production. Here, we constructed plasmid-based and chromosomal wzzE mutants in E. coli K-12 with alterations that affect chain-length regulation of other PCP1 and assessed their effects on ECACYC biogenesis. Our data show loss of chain-length regulation and ECACYC synthesis from mutations altering transmembrane helix 2 and mutations altering the periplasmic domain of WzzE. We also identified two WzzE variants to the same residue with identical, near wild type linear ECA chain-length regulation but differing effects on ECACYC production. Specifically, WzzEF104Y produces wild-type levels of ECACYC, while WzzEF104H produces twofold less ECACYC than wild type, demonstrating ECACYC synthesis is genetically separable from chain length regulation.

This was recently confirmed through the cultivation of two classes of methanogenic Thermoproteota. Thus far, all methanogens within the Thermoproteota are predicted or were shown to be methylotrophic.

To this end, we prepared a series of model membranes with cardiolipin and other test lipids with comparable surface charge and lateral packing characteristics. Using multiple independent experimental approaches, we found that cardiolipin inhibited SMA solubilization. Our results indicate that this effect was not attributable to headgroup charge effects, but rather to cardiolipin-induced increase in lateral packing pressure at the interfacial region. Reduction of this lateral packing pressure using bilayer-active alcohols partially restored SMA solubilization.

BET involvement in gene expression responses is not universal, and understanding of the cell-type and signaling pathway requirements that dictate BET dependence remains incomplete. We previously demonstrated that, in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, GPCR-induced hypertrophy response depended strongly on the BET protein Brd4 when signaling was coupled to Gs, but not Gq. Here we tested whether Brd4 was differentially responsive to G protein isoforms in HEK 293 cells by expressing Gs or Gq-coupled Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). Gq induced expression of a group of early response genes and inflammatory genes in a manner largely insensitive to pharmacological BET inhibition, consistent with our previous data in cardiomyocytes. Gs activated a small subset of the Gq-induced genes, but this effect was largely reversed by the BET degrader molecule dBET6.

Instead, heart and muscle mitochondria robustly respire on medium-chain acylcarnitines. The mitochondrial matrix enzyme carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) efficiently converts orally delivered octanoylcarnitine (C8 carnitine) to octanoyl CoA for energy generation. C8-carnitine exhibits twice the oral bioavailability of triheptanoin and distributes to muscle and heart. A single oral dose markedly enhances grip strength, basal locomotion, and treadmill endurance while attenuating lactate and creatine kinase elevations in multiple mouse models of LC-FAODs.

{"title": "A Compartmental Model for Simulating the Gut-Brain Axis in Gastric Function Regulation", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.19.660643", "authors": "Fernandes, S. Q.; Kothare, M. V.", "abstract": "Gastric function is regulated by the gut-brain axis, which integrates vagal and enteric nervous system (ENS) pathways. The parasympathetic circuit within the vagal pathway promotes digestion by stimulating peristaltic activity and relaxing the Pyloric sphincter (PS) through motor and sensory neurons. In contrast, the sympathetic pathway inhibits digestion by suppressing peristalsis and constricting the PS, highlighting the complex neural coordination involved in gastric regulation. This study introduces a novel mathematical model of the gut-brain axis using a computationally efficient compartmental framework. The model simulates the vagal and ENS pathways and their corresponding effects on gastric function to improve our understanding of gut-brain axis regulation. The model employs the Michaelis-Menten equation with a Hill coefficient (MMEHC) equation to capture neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions by stimulation of motor neurons and its effects on gastric cells. Motor (efferent) neurons are modeled for three key stomach regions: the fundus (tonic activity), antrum (phasic activity), and PS (both tonic and phasic activity). Thus, the stomach is represented as a three-compartment model. The stomach model extends our previous work (Fernandes et al., 2024) by incorporating passive stress and dynamic changes in stomach geometry. Sensory (afferent) inputs are represented through linear equations that account for chemo- and mechanoreceptor activity, while a binary variable captures the sympathetic response. Afferent and efferent firing rates are linked via fitted curves to effectively close the gut-brain axis feedback loop, borrowing from a similar approach used to model cardiovascular regulation. The simulation results align with physiological observations, demonstrating inhibitory digestive activity during sympathetic responses and excitatory activity, such as gastric emptying, during parasympathetic responses. During gastric emptying, the Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICC) activity shows constant amplitude for low to medium gastric volumes but exhibits an increase in amplitude at very high gastric volumes. Furthermore, gastric emptying rates decrease with high-calorie liquids due to PS regulation, validating the potential of the model for studying Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and developing vagal-based therapies.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we generated a library of 53 Pepper variants containing substitutions, insertions, and/or deletions to quantitatively evaluate the contributions of individual nucleotides to HBC530 binding affinity, magnesium binding affinity, and fluorescence intensity. Our results reveal that the correlation between HBC530 binding affinity and fluorescence intensity is only modest. We identify several variants with binding affinities similar to wild-type Pepper but dramatically reduced fluorescence, indicating that ligand recognition and fluorescence intensity are decoupled.

Using two 16S rRNA sequencing methods with different levels of taxonomic resolution, we confirmed drought-associated enrichment of Streptomyces in field-grown sorghum roots and identified five closely related but distinct ASVs belonging to the genus with variable drought enrichment patterns. From a culture collection of sorghum root endophytes, we selected 12 Streptomyces isolates representing these ASVs for phenotypic and genomic characterization. Whole-genome sequencing revealed substantial variation in gene content, even among closely related isolates, and exometabolomic profiling showed distinct metabolic responses to media supplemented with drought- versus well-watered root tissue. Traits linked to drought survival, including osmotic stress tolerance, siderophore production, and carbon utilization, varied widely among isolates and were not phylogenetically conserved. Using a broader panel of 48 Streptomyces, we demonstrate that drought enrichment (DE) scores, determined through mono-association experiments in gnotobiotic sorghum systems, showed high variability and lacked correlation with plant growth promotion. Pangenome-wide association identified gene clusters involved in osmolyte transport (e.g., proP) and membrane biosynthesis (e.g., fabG) as positively associated with DE, though most associations lacked phylogenetic signal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Streptomyces enrichment under drought is not a conserved genus-level trait but is instead strain-specific and functionally heterogeneous. Furthermore, enrichment in the root microbiome does not predict beneficial effects on plant growth.

Fleshy fruits develop from the ovaries of flowers, and both organs use the same suites of pigments to create color. Due to these developmental links and functional similarities, we sought to test for correlations in flower and fruit color lability across clades. METHODS: We selected 51 clades (2989 species) of animal-pollinated and animal-dispersed plants and scored flower and fruit color into eight discrete (human-perceived) categories for the same set of species in each clade. We used stochastic character mapping to estimate the number and rates of transitions among colors in flowers and fruits. KEY RESULTS: We demonstrate a negative correlation in the number of transitions in flower and fruit color across clades (R2 = 0.48, p < 0.001). Among animal-pollinated and animal-dispersed clades, the majority (67%) are \"fruit clades\" biased towards fruit color lability, while a minority (29%) are \"flower clades\" biased towards flower color lability. We further show that clades with many yellow- or orange-flowered species also tend to have those colors in their fruits, and that red flowers are more common in \"flower clades\" while green and brown fruits are more common in \"fruit clades\". CONCLUSIONS: These patterns suggest that clades specialize on one phase of reproduction or the other. Possible explanations include constraints on energetic investment into either pollination or dispersal, and environmental factors that select for color diversification in one organ but not the other. This variation is also likely shaped by the underlying structure of pigment pathways that contribute to color in both organs.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

We find that stimulation preferentially increases firing rates in pyramidal cells compared to interneurons and also strengthens cell assemblies. Using single cell multiomics, we link the observed physiological changes to cell type-specific gene expression patterns. We detail gene regulatory networks that indicate preferential involvement of specific excitatory neuron subtypes and the response of non-neurons.

Screening for the DVB regulated spicule protraction behavior identified multiple autism genes involved, but only unc-44/ANK2 and CACNA2D3/unc-36 were shared between screens. Application of a metric geometry computational framework (CAJAL) to the DVB morphology dataset identified 5 additional genes that impact DVB morphology, including unc-2/CACNA1A and unc-10/RIMS1, which also significantly impacted behavior. This work defines new regulators and molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent neuron remodeling and circuit plasticity, and further links these processes with conserved autism genes. It also demonstrates the utility of using intact, behavior generating circuits in C. elegans, to screen for novel roles for conserved autism genes.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}

J.; Navarro, V. M.", "abstract": "Energy expenditure (EE) is essential for metabolic homeostasis, yet its central regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify arcuate Kiss1 neurons as key regulators of EE in male mice. Ablation of these neurons induced obesity, while their chemogenetic activation increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis without affecting food intake. This action is mediated by glutamatergic projections from Kiss1ARC neurons to CART/Lepr-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus, which activate the raphe pallidus-BAT pathway. CRISPR-mediated deletion of the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) from Kiss1ARC neurons replicated the obesogenic effect. Furthermore, deletion of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) from Kiss1 neurons resulted in obesity, reduced energy expenditure and impaired thermogenesis. Optogenetic stimulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) fibers evoked inward currents in Kiss1 neurons, that were attenuated by MC4R antagonism. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized neural circuit that mediates melanocortin action on energy expenditure, offering new insights into central mechanisms of metabolic control.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Context-aware sequence-to-activity model of human gene regulation", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.25.661447", "authors": "Aksu, E. D.; Vingron, M.", "abstract": "Sequence-to-activity models have been very successful in predicting gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and epigenetic marks from DNA sequences alone. However, current state-of-the-art models have a fundamental limitation: they cannot extrapolate beyond the cell types and conditions included in their training dataset. Here, we introduce a new approach that is designed to overcome this limitation: Corgi, a new context-aware sequence-to-activity model that accurately predicts genome-wide gene expression and epigenetic signals, even in previously unseen cell types. We designed an architecture that strives to emulate the cell: Corgi integrates DNA sequence and trans-regulator expression to predict the coverage of multiple assays including chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and gene expression. We define trans-regulators as transcription factors, histone modifiers, transcriptional coactivators, and RNA binding proteins, which directly modulate chromatin states, gene expression, and mRNA decay. Trained on a diverse set of bulk and single cell human datasets, Corgi has robust predictive performance, approaching experimental-level accuracy in gene expression predictions in previously unseen cell types, while also setting a new state-of-the-art level for joint cross-sequence and cross-cell type epigenetic track prediction.", "date": "2025-06-25", "journal": ""}
