We present TopoMetry, a geometry-aware framework that learns intrinsic coordinate systems directly from the data and refines them into high-fidelity spectral scaffolds. These scaffolds capture both local neighborhoods and global structure, supporting downstream analysis such as clustering and visualization. In benchmarks across diverse single-cell datasets, TopoMetry preserved geometry more reliably than standard workflows and revealed biological signals otherwise obscured, including unexpected transcriptional diversity among T cells and links between RNA-defined subpopulations and clonal expansion. The full analysis can be run with a single line of code to generate a comprehensive report, making the framework both powerful and accessible. Beyond individual findings, TopoMetry warrants a shift of focus from static two-dimensional projections to the systematic learning and evaluation of single-cell geometry itself, enabling more faithful exploration of cellular diversity.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

S.; Wiesner, S.", "abstract": "Motion speed provides a salient cue for visual segmentation, yet how the visual system represents and differentiates multiple speeds remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the neural coding of multiple speeds. First, we characterized the perceptual capacity of human and macaque subjects to segment overlapping random-dot stimuli moving at different speeds. We then recorded from neurons in the middle temporal (MT) cortex of macaque monkeys to determine how multiple speeds are represented. We made a novel finding that the responses of MT neurons to two speeds showed a robust bias toward the faster speed component when both speeds were slow ([&le;] 20/s). This faster-speed bias emerged early in the neuronal response. It occurred regardless of whether the two speed components moved in the same or different directions, and even when attention was directed away from the receptive field. As stimulus speed increased, the faster-speed bias diminished. Our finding can be explained by a modified divisive normalization model, in which the weights for the speed components are proportional to the responses of a population of neurons, referred to as the weighting pool, elicited by the individual speeds. We suggest that the weighting pool include neurons with a broad range of speed preferences. We found that a classifier can differentiate the responses of MT neurons to two speeds versus a corresponding log-mean speed. We further showed that it was possible to decode two speeds from MT population response, supporting the theoretical framework of coding multiplicity of visual features in neuronal populations. The decoded speeds can account for the perceptual performance of segmenting two speeds with a large (x4) but not a small (x2) separation, raising questions for future investigations. Our findings help define the neural coding rule of multiple speeds. The faster-speed bias in MT at slow stimulus speeds could benefit important behavioral tasks such as figure-ground segregation, as figural objects tend to move faster than the background in the natural environment.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

P.; Rubenson, J.; Wiktorowicz-Conroy, A.; Clemente, C.", "abstract": "Hopping kangaroos exhibit remarkably little change in their rate of metabolic energy expenditure with locomotor speed compared to other running animals. This phenomenon may be related to greater elastic energy savings due to increasing tendon stress; however, the mechanisms which enable the rise in stress without additional muscle work remain poorly understood. In this study, we created a three-dimensional (3D) kangaroo musculoskeletal model, integrating 3D motion capture and force plate data, to analyse the kinematics and kinetics of hopping red and grey kangaroos. Using our model, we evaluated how body mass and speed influence (i) hindlimb posture, (ii) effective mechanical advantage (EMA), (iii) the associated tendon stress in the ankle extensors, and (iv) ankle work during hopping. We found that increasing ankle dorsiflexion and metatarsophalangeal plantarflexion likely played an important role in decreasing ankle EMA by altering both the muscle and external moment arms, which subsequently increased energy absorption and peak tendon stress at the ankle. Surprisingly, kangaroo hindlimb posture changes appeared to contribute to increased tendon stress, allowing more elastic energy storage at faster speeds. These posture-mediated increases in elastic energy storage and return could be a key factor enabling kangaroos to achieve energetic benefits at faster hopping speeds, but may limit the performance of large kangaroos due to the risk of tendon rupture.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Most mouse studies focus on adults, despite human research showing critical developmental changes in childhood and adolescence. We examined social behavior in juvenile male and female Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice as well as heterozygous (HET) females. We further assessed cortical activity in KO females to better understand early phenotypes. Methods: Juvenile mice of both sexes and genotypes were paired in same-sex, novel dyads for 10-minute interactions. Key social behaviors such as head, anogenital, and body sniffing, and physical touch, as well as distance travelled, were analyzed with a marker-less tracking software. Frontal-parietal EEG recordings were collected from wild-type (WT) and KO females in home cage and social contexts to analyze power spectra across frequency bands. Results: HET and KO females engaged in more frequent but shorter interaction events compared to WT females, with HET females showing the highest counts. Males displayed similar trends when comparing KO and WT. Males engaged in overall higher interaction events than females. EEG analyses revealed altered oscillatory activity in KO females compared to WT females, especially within theta, alpha, and beta bands, most prominently during the early interaction phase. Locomotor activity correlated weakly with head/anogenital sniffing but more strongly with body sniffing and touch. Discussion: These findings suggest that Fmr1-related differences in juvenile social behavior are sex-dependent and associated with cortical oscillatory changes. Characterizing these early phenotypes in both sexes allows us to further understand FXS development and informs potential routes for early intervention.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Currently, both DNA and RNA serve as active insecticidal ingredients, transcending their traditional role as carriers of genetic information. This novel activity is achieved through two fundamentally distinct mechanisms: DNA containment (DNAc), employing oligonucleotide insecticides based on contact unmodified antisense DNA biotechnology (CUADb), also known as 'genetic zipper' technology, and RNA interference (RNAi), employing RNA biocontrols based on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) technology. The investigation of the molecular mechanism underlying the antisense activity of nucleic acids emerged in the early 1960s. While the antisense function of RNA in gene silencing through interference (RNAi) has been documented in the late1990s as an antiviral immune response in nematodes, the CUADb antisense approach initially emerged as a powerful strategy for pest control against lepidopterans in 2008. CUADb approach relies on disrupting rRNA biogenesis and ribosome production, a process entirely distinct from RNAi. The efficacy of these approaches appears to be species dependent: while CUADb demonstrates optimal activity against Sternorrhyncha (e.g., aphids, mealybugs, psyllids, scale insects), thrips, and mites, RNAi strategy shows a strong insecticidal potential against beetles from the Tenebrionidae and Chrysomelidae families.

Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is among the most studied proteins linked to brain pathology; however, its role in non-pathological brain aging remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigate the natural impact of APP on normal brain aging using the short-lived turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), which exhibits rapid and spontaneous age-related decline. We found that a pyroglutamated APP derivative (APPpE11) accumulates intra-neuronally in an age-dependent manner, co-localizing with a marker of cell death. We found that intraneuronal APPpE11 is also present in brains from healthy elderly humans, suggesting deep evolutionary conservation. To determine APP role in spontaneous brain aging, we knock-out amyloid precursor protein a (appa) in killifish via CRISPR/Cas9. The lack of appa mitigated brain aging from a proteome-wide perspective, reduced age-related cell death and inflammation, and improved neuronal activity and learning capacity in aged individuals.

C.; Pan, M.; Kawaji, Q.; Liu, G.; Javid, B.", "abstract": "A central dogma of molecular biology is the \"speed-accuracy trade-off,\" where ribosomes must slow down to ensure accurate protein synthesis. In mycobacteria, a high basal level of mistranslation at glutamine and asparagine codons, caused by an indirect tRNA aminoacylation pathway, promotes tolerance to the antibiotic rifampicin. While pharmacologically increasing translational fidelity is a promising strategy to combat antibiotic tolerance, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we screened 9,000 synthetic compounds and identified benzo[d]isoxazole-4,7-diones as a novel chemical class that reduces mycobacterial mistranslation. Medicinal chemistry optimization yielded a lead compound, 9787, with superior potency in decreasing mistranslation and reversing rifampicin tolerance. Using competitive chemical proteomics, we identified the 30S ribosomal protein S5 (RpS5) as the specific cellular target. Remarkably, compound 9787 enhances translational fidelity at concentrations that do not measurably impact the overall rate of protein synthesis. Our findings challenge the universality of the speed-accuracy trade-off, demonstrating that fidelity can be improved independently of translation speed.

Prior work has demonstrated that there are differences in the activation of granule neurons in the supra and infrapyramidal blades of the DG during a range of hippocampal dependent tasks. Here we used an automated touch screen pattern separation task combined to temporally controlled tagging of active neurons to determine how performance in a cognitively demanding task affected patterns of neural activity in the DG. We found an increase in the blade-biased activity of suprapyramidal mature granule cells (mGCs) during the performance of a high cognitive demand segment of the task, with a further characteristic distribution of active neurons along the apex to blade, and hilar to molecular layer axes. Chemogenetic inhibition of adult-born granule cells (abDGCs) beyond a critical window of their maturation significantly impaired performance of mice during high-demand conditions but not when cognitive demand was low. abDGC inhibition also elevated the total activity of mGCs and disturbed the patterned distribution of active mGCs even in mice that eventually succeeded in the task. Conversely chemogenetic inhibition of mGCs reduced success in the high cognitive demand portion of this task and decreased the global number of active GCs without affecting the patterned distribution of active cells. These findings demonstrate how a high cognitive demand pattern separation task preferentially activates mGCs in subregions of the DG and are consistent with a modulatory role for abDGCs on the dentate circuit which in part governs the spatially organized patterns of activity of mGCs.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Mechanistic studies revealed a pathway for radical intermediate formation via excited-state FI*-induced single-electron oxidation of carbanions under alkaline conditions.

Mechanistically, lomitapide inhibits triacylglycerides synthesis to interfere with CLSA and chemotherapy-induced lipidomic reprogramming.

While existing models have emphasized the contributions of cellular- and network-level properties, the core mechanisms underlying rhythmogenesis remain incompletely understood. Further, neither family of models has fully accounted for recent experimental results in zebrafish and other organisms pointing to the importance of long-range, cell-type-specific connectivity patterns and recruitment of speed-selective subpopulations of interneurons. Informed by these experimental findings and others, we developed a hierarchy of increasingly detailed models of the locomotor circuit. Coordinated locomotion emerged in an inhibition-dominated network in which connectivity is determined by desired phase relationships among interneurons and variable-speed control is implemented by recruitment of speed-selective subpopulations. Further, while structured excitatory connections were not necessary for rhythmogenesis, they were useful for increasing the peak locomotion frequency, albeit at the cost of losing some control at intermediate frequencies, suggesting a basic computational trade-off between speed and control. Together, this family of models shows that network-level interactions are sufficient to generate coordinated, variable-speed locomotion, providing new interpretations of intersegmental excitatory and inhibitory connectivity, as well as the basic, recruitment-based mechanism of speed control.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

However, the interplay between surface binding and surface phase separation is poorly understood.

Our theory extends the classical surface binding isotherm to account for non-dilute and heterogeneous conditions where components can phase separate. Using this framework we demonstrate how surface phase separation is governed by the interaction strength among membrane-bound scaffold proteins and their binding affinity to the membrane surface. Comparing the theory to reconstitution experiments, we show that tuning the oligomerization state of the adhesion receptors in the membrane controls surface phase transition and patterning of the scaffold protein ZO1. These findings suggest a fundamental role of the interplay between non-dilute surface binding and surface phase separation in the formation of the tight junction.

F.; Brossy, T.; Stastny, D.; Sachl, R.; Hof, M.; Radenovic, A.; Presse, S.", "abstract": "Mobile biological particles, ranging from biomolecules to viral capsids, often diffuse faster than 1 m2/s, resulting in severe motion blur in conventional millisecond-scale imaging. While shorter exposures may help provide the data needed to capture faster dynamics, quantization of signal intensity per pixel at such exposures eventually interferes with our ability to track. In the extreme case of binary (1-bit-per-pixel) output---where going from 8-bit conventional grayscale imaging to 1-bit directly corresponds to a 255-fold faster acquisition rate---no existing tracking methods can be used, as these methods fundamentally rely on intensity-based localization, which does not leverage the binary output. For this reason, we introduce single-photon single-particle tracking (SP2T), a framework that bypasses localization and linking by estimating particle numbers and trajectories directly by jointly considering 1-bit image stacks. While cameras capable of microsecond-scale exposures, typically based on scientific CMOS sensors or single-photon detectors (SPDs), are increasingly central to this effort, in this work, we focus on single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD). Single-photon detector (SPD) arrays offer microsecond exposures over large fields of view (512x512 pixels). SP2T accounts for detector-specific artifacts such as hot and cold pixels and is validated with programmed fluorescent bead trajectories and biological systems (aerolysin and ganglioside). These experiments, in addition to simulations, reveal that analysis performed with longer exposures can bias diffusion coefficient estimates (up to 70% for particles with diffusion coefficients of 1 m2/s) and distort jump-distance distributions, underscoring the need for photon-by-photon tracking in fast-diffusion regimes. Moreover, SP2T delivers substantial computational gains---achieving more than a 50-fold GPU speedup over CPU-based likelihood tracking methods that assume continuous intensity, when compared on datasets with the same frame size and number of frames.

We have used recent cryoEM structures of Cx50 and the predictive power of Alphafold3 to identify the presence of a carbamylation motif, originally described in Cx26, that suggests that Cx50 might be CO2 sensitive. By expressing the naturally truncated version of Cx50 in HeLa cells and utilising coexpression of genetically encoded sensors iGluSnFr or eLACCO1.1, we have demonstrated the CO2-dependent opening of Cx50 hemichannels, and their permeability to lactate and glutamate. By mutating the two key residues of the carbamylation motif, K105 and K140, we have shown that the motif is required for CO2 sensitivity. Mutations of the residue V44 cause cataracts and these mutations abolish the CO2 sensitivity of Cx50. Using Fluo-4 Ca2+ imaging with lens slices we have demonstrated CO2 -dependent Ca2+ influxes into fibre cells that are blocked by La3+ and exhibit the same CO2 dose dependence as Cx50 hemichannels. Lens fibre cells respond to glutamate via NMDA receptors and our data shows that the Ca2+ influx to raised PCO2 partially depends on NMDA receptor activation. We hypothesize that CO2-dependent gating of Cx50, subsequent release of glutamate resulting in the downstream activation of glutamate receptors, and the consequent alterations in transmembrane Na+ fluxes, provide homeostatic control of the microcirculation system that is critical for lens health.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Zika virus (ZIKV) is particularly concerning due to its associated pathological complications, including microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults, posing a significant threat to public health. Despite efforts made by the scientific community, no licensed drugs against flaviviruses have been developed. Medicinal plants show promise as a novel source of antiviral agents, as they possess a diverse array of biologically active secondary metabolites, making them potential candidates for therapeutic use. Here, we sought to investigate the antiviral potential of rosemary extract (RE) against ZIKV in human dermal fibroblasts (HFF-1), one of the earliest cellular targets of infection. ZIKV was treated with various concentrations of RE or its major polyphenols, including rosmarinic acid (RA), carnosic acid (CA), and carnosol (CO), and the infectivity of each sample was measured by plaque reduction assay. To evaluate the impact of RE on different stages of the ZIKV replication cycle, HFF-1 cells were treated before, during, and after infection, or the virus was treated before infection. RE exerted potent virucidal activity against ZIKV in both Vero and HFF-1 cells by directly acting on virus particles before infection. Importantly, RE significantly inhibited the later stages of the virus replication cycle by interfering with post-entry mechanisms within the host cell. Moreover, major RE-derived polyphenols CA and CO, but not RA, were shown to significantly reduce infectivity when ZIKV was pre-treated with each compound individually. Overall, RE significantly impairs ZIKV infection in vitro by directly interacting with virus particles prior to adsorption and interfering with post-entry processes of the viral replication cycle. This study highlights the antiviral potential of RE and its individual components, warranting further investigation into the mechanisms underlying their activity and their effects on other medically important flaviviruses.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

However, the central question of how DTPs epigenetically coordinate their metabolic flexibility to adapt early to therapeutic stress remains unanswered. We have recently shown that the histone demethylase KDM5B, which is intrinsically expressed in differentiated melanoma DTPs, reprograms the metabolic cell landscape. However, the exact mechanism by which KDM5B affects underlying metabolic enzymes, and whether this reveals new druggable vulnerabilities, remain unknown. By transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of BRAFV600 melanoma cells following KDM5B gene silencing, we discovered a direct molecular axis between the epigenetic regulator KDM5B and the PRDX/TXN ROS detoxification system. This metabolic axis is regulated independently of KDM5B's demethylase activity. Furthermore, RNAi approaches and the pharmacological inhibition of the PRDX/TXN system led to ROS-induced cell death in differentiated melanoma DTPs and a delay of resistance development to MAPK inhibition. This process was independent of lipid-ROS-driven ferroptosis. Additionally, single-cell transcriptome analyses from pre-clinical melanoma models under continuous MAPK inhibitory treatment demonstrated altered cellular differentiation dynamics, with a reduction in the early evolution into the mesenchymal DTP state under concomitant PRDX inhibition. Interestingly, the degree of melanoma cell state differentiation at the onset of treatment was a major determinant for the transition towards the neural crest-like DTP state. Our study identified a high degree of epigenetic-metabolic connectivity and flexibility within the melanoma DTP pool and urges caution with single redox pathway-targeted strategies for tumor elimination in the future. Prospectively, our results point towards a new resistance targeting strategy for BRAFV600 melanoma patients based on pharmacological re-direction of the evolution of melanoma cell states already at therapy onset.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We then validate the key predictions of this model using dopamine recordings across striatal regions in mice, as well as human behavior across various tasks including a new hybrid learning task. Finally, we find that changes in learning resulting from optogenetic stimulation of the sensory-dorsal striatum in mice and individual variability in hallucinations in humans are best explained by selectively enhancing dopamine levels in the model sensory-dorsal striatum.

Yet, the potential and limitations of ancient protein sequences to resolve evolutionary relations between species remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to quantify how much information about these relations can be obtained from limited ancient protein data, at the scale that is currently available or will be available in the near future. We harness sequence alignments of 12 enamel and collagen proteins that have been previously reported in fossil material that is at least 1 million years old. We utilise in silico translations of hominid DNA sequences of these proteins and highlight their differential sequence conservation, indicating some of them contain much larger amounts of information than others. We also evaluate the extent to which inferred topologies from protein data differ from inferred topologies from the more informationally-dense DNA data. We show that the former may sometimes lead to inferences of the wrong tree topology due to the informational loss that comes when working with peptide data. Additionally, we determine the number of concatenated proteins necessary to confidently reconstruct the population / species tree summarizing the relations between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, as well as those between modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. As expected, increasing the number of proteins in a concatenation enhances resolution, but we note that trees inferred from the full set of collagen and enamel proteins do not necessarily correspond to population trees inferred from genome-wide data.As expected, increasing the number of proteins in a concatenation enhances resolution, but we note that trees inferred from the full set of collagen and enamel proteins do not necessarily correspond to population trees inferred from genome-wide data.

DTU analysis requires the quantification of individual isoforms from RNA-seq data, which has a high level of uncertainty due to transcript overlap and read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA). Popular DTU analysis methods do not directly account for the RTA overdispersion within their statistical frameworks, leading to reduced statistical power or poor error rate control, particularly in scenarios with small sample sizes. This article presents limma and edgeR analysis pipelines that account for RTA during DTU assessment. Leveraging recent advancements in the limma and edgeR Bioconductor packages, we propose DTU analysis pipelines optimized for small and large datasets with a unified interface via the diffSplice function. The pipelines make use of divided counts to remove RTA-induced dispersion from transcript isoform counts and account for the sparsity in transcript-level counts. Simulations and analysis of real data from mouse mammary epithelial cells demonstrate that the diffSplice pipelines provide greater power, improved efficiency, and improved FDR control compared to existing specialized DTU methods.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

While animal models have elucidated key conserved signaling pathways involved in early TE specification, including BMP, WNT, and HIPPO, species-specific differences during early development emphasize the need for human-specific models. We previously identified VGLL1, a coactivator of TEAD transcription factors, as a human-specific placental marker. In this study, we employed a pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-based model of TE induction by BMP4 to investigate chromatin remodeling and transcriptional dynamics during TE formation. BMP4-induced chromatin accessibility changes promoted a trophoblast gene expression program, while mesoderm lineage markers were only transiently expressed upon canonical WNT activation. We found that VGLL1 was expressed downstream of key TE transcription factors (GATA2/3, TFAP2A/C) but was essential for establishment of full trophoblast identity by up-regulating EGFR and reinforcing GATA3 expression through positive feedback. Notably, VGLL1 enhanced canonical WNT signaling via direct regulation of WNT receptors and effectors. We also identified KDM6B, a histone demethylase that removes H3K27me3 repressive marks, as a direct VGLL1 target. KDM6B facilitated activation of bivalent promoters associated with TE markers, linking epigenetic regulation to lineage identity.

The genetic determinants of the trait remain incompletely understood, and we sought to understand the role in its architecture of species variation in mitochondrial DNA. We used mitochondrial transgenesis to show that S. cerevisiae mitotypes were sufficient for a partial boost to thermotolerance and respiration in the S. paradoxus background. These mitochondrial alleles worked best when the background also harbored a pro-thermotolerance nuclear genotype, attesting to positive epistasis between the two genomes.

By doing so, QTrack surpasses the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) prediction assuming continuous intensity and localization-and-linking. To make this possible in practice, QTrack exploits the parallelism inherent in both likelihood evaluation and posterior sampling through vectorization, multi-threading, and GPU acceleration, with lightweight inter-thread communication. On a single mid-range GPU (Nvidia GTX 1060, 6 GB), QTrack achieves up to a 50-fold speedup compared to a serial CPU implementation, while maintaining full accuracy and data efficiency.

A.; Poh, W.-C.; Stansfeld, P.

To establish proper lipid asymmetry, cells need to ensure an intricate balance of constituent OM components, especially lipids. In this regard, the conserved, trans-envelope Tol-Pal complex plays a primary role in maintaining OM lipid homeostasis, thus OM integrity, possibly via retrograde phospholipid transport. However, mechanistic details for this process are unknown, owing to the lack of evidence for direct lipid binding. In this study, we discover that the periplasmic protein TolB, a key component of the Tol-Pal system, associates directly with membranes in vitro, via specific interactions with cardiolipin (CL). Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a CL-binding site on TolB; a single amino acid mutation at this site abolishes in vitro membrane interaction, consequently impairing cellular Tol-Pal function in maintaining OM homeostasis in Escherichia coli. Curiously, we find that the functional requirement for TolB-CL interactions can be partially bypassed in cells lacking CL, suggesting compensatory effects through other lipids only when CL is absent. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated lipid-binding role for TolB, and provide novel insights into how the Tol-Pal complex may facilitate phospholipid transport across the cell envelope.

M.", "abstract": "In multicellular organisms, germ cells' transformation into haploid gametes requires that they transition from mitosis to meiosis, whereby they stop mitotic cycling and enter the meiotic cell cycle. In mammals, transcriptional activator STRA8-MEIOSIN mediates the decision to enter the meiotic cell cycle by triggering the G1-to-meiotic S phase transition. However, the molecular basis by which mammalian germ cells prevent continued mitotic cycling before entering the meiotic cell cycle remains unclear. Here, we investigate MEIOC's role in the mitosis-to-meiosis transition during mouse oogenesis by analyzing proliferation, cell cycle transcriptomics, and cell cycle-associated protein expression. MEIOC was previously shown to destabilize mRNA and repress the mitotic program after meiotic entry. Here, we demonstrate that MEIOC prevents continued mitotic cycling prior to meiotic entry in oogenic cells. We find that the mitosis-to-meiosis transition involves the repression of G1/S cyclin CCNA2 at the transcript and protein levels, and that MEIOC downregulates CCNA2 protein expression. In addition, MEIOC promotes entry into meiotic S phase by increasing Meiosin transcript abundance and consequently activating the STRA8-MEIOSIN transcription factor. Given that STRA8-MEIOSIN upregulates Meioc expression, MEIOC and STRA8-MEIOSIN form a positive feedback loop to reinforce timely meiotic initiation. We also demonstrate that BMP signaling halts mitotic cycling and promotes meiotic entry by upregulating MEIOC. We conclude that, in mouse oogenic cells, the transition from mitosis to meiosis occurs as two molecularly regulated steps - (i) halt of mitotic cycling and (ii) entry into the meiotic cell cycle - and that MEIOC modifies the cell cycle program to facilitate both steps in this transition.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We analyzed 435 BL. genomes using a polyphasic taxonomic approach comprising average nucleotide identity (ANI), digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), and pangenome analysis.

Furthermore, BL. nexti demonstrates unique metabolic capabilities, including efficient utilization of fructose, and starch, carbohydrates not metabolized well by other tested BL. subspecies.

Different frameworks, originating in opposing views of the function of interoception, have developed largely in parallel. One line of evidence (Internal/External Competition) indicates that interoceptive and exteroceptive inputs compete for neural resources. Another line (Self-related Facilitation) shows a link between interoceptive and self-related processing, which might include computing the self-relevance of exteroceptive inputs. We contrasted these accounts within a single experimental task for which they yielded distinct predictions. We measured heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs, a measure of cardiac interoception) with EEG, and manipulated the self-relevance of an audio-tactile stimulus by placing the audio source either inside or outside the peripersonal space immediately around the body. On one hand, pre-stimulus HEP amplitudes over somatosensory cortex were linked to slower reaction times, and affected audio-tactile stimulus-evoked responses in the same area, indicating competition for shared neural resources. On the other hand, pre-stimulus HEPs over integrative sensorimotor and default-mode network regions facilitated stimulus self-relevance encoding, both in reaction times and audio-tactile evoked responses. Importantly, Competition and Facilitation effects were spatially and statistically independent from each other. We therefore reconcile the two views by showing the co-existence of two independent mechanisms: one that allocates neural resources to either internal bodily signals or the external world, and another by which interoception and exteroception are combined to determine the self-relevance of external signals.

ORB2 interacts with a suite of post-transcriptional regulators in early embryos; a subset of these interactions is lost upon deletion of the ZZ domain, notably with the Cup repressive complex. ORB2-targets significantly overlap with those previously identified for the repressive RBP, Smaug (SMG).

Hyperspectral imaging is a state-of-the art computer vision approach, which can improve plant disease classification, by capturing a wide range of wavelengths before symptoms become visible to the naked eye. Whilst a lot of work has been done applying the technique to identifying single infections, to our knowledge, it has not been used to analyse multiple concurrent infections which presents both practical and scientific challenges. In this study, we investigated three wheat pathogens (yellow rust, mildew and Septoria), cultivating co-occurring infections, resulting in a dataset of 1,447 hyperspectral images of single and double infections on wheat leaves. We used this dataset to train four disease classification algorithms (based on four neural network architectures: Inception and EfficientNet with either a 2D or 3D convolutional layer input). The highest accuracy was achieved by EfficientNet with a 2D convolution input with 81% overall classification accuracy, including a 72% accuracy for detecting a combined infection of yellow rust and mildew. Moreover, we found that hyperspectral signatures of a pathogen depended on whether another pathogen was present, raising interesting questions about co-existence of several pathogens on one plant host. Our work demonstrates that the application of hyperspectral imaging and deep learning is promising for classification of multiple infections in wheat, even with a relatively small training dataset, and opens opportunities for further research in this area. However, the limited number of Septoria and yellow rust + Septoria samples highlights the need for larger, more balanced datasets in future studies to further validate and extend our findings under field conditions.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

J.; Abdelaziz, M.; Clo, J.", "abstract": "The amount of genetic diversity is a key parameter to understand the adaptive potential of populations. It has been demonstrated both theoretically and empirically that several factors influence genetic variance. In angiosperms, two of those are the ploidy level and the mating system of the populations. Polyploidy is theoretically known to increase adaptive potential in the long term. Self-fertilization has been theoretically associated with a decrease in genetic variance, even if it lacks empirical support. These factors have been studied independently, but are often shared in plants. However, there is a lack of empirical studies about the joint effects of polyploidy and selfing on genetic variance. In this paper, we conducted theoretical simulations to explore how genetic diversity could be affected by the ploidy level and mating system. We compared the simulation results with empirical estimates of genetic variance from the plant species Erysimum incanum, a selfing species from the Western Mediterranean basin exhibiting three different ploidy levels. We measured a series of phenotypic traits in individuals of each ploidy, obtained by controlled crosses and grown in different climatic conditions. While theoretical approaches showed a positive relationship between ploidy and genetic variance in both the short and long term, empirical results show lower evolvability and transgressive segregation for polyploids, both results being dependent on environmental conditions. Genetic variance in E. incanum polyploids could be related to recent establishment and adaptation to harsh environments, which explains the apparent contradiction with theory, where more settled and established populations are considered.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

One hypothesis proposed to explain navigation in bees and ants is navigation by scene familiarity. In this paper, we propose that scorpions use ground-directed sensors (instead of vision) to augment navigation. Specifically, the paired pectines may detect matrices of chemical and textural information and compare it to stored memories, allowing the animal to step toward the most familiar ''scene.'' We first show that this form of familiarity navigation is consistent with scorpion homing excursions. We then developed a familiarity-based computer-simulated agent and analyzed navigation success using multiple combinations of sensor sensitivity levels, sensor resolutions, and landscape characteristics. We also assessed the effects of additional sensory channels and of landscape disruption. Finally, we showed that the simulated agent can navigate across a landscape the size of a typical sand scorpion's home range.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Several noise sources contribute to this challenge, including unrelated neuronal activity, non-brain bioelectricity, attenuation by the skull and scalp, and environmental noises. Additionally, the accumulation of noise varies significantly across subjects and recording sessions, resulting in widely diverging distributions of degraded observations. In this study, we propose modeling the noise accumulation process as a Schrodinger bridge and decoding the true signal by reversing this process. Compared to conventional guided Diffusion approach, our Schrodinger bridge approach effectively models diverse noise processes within a single framework, exhibiting greater robustness to inter-subject variability. Also, our approach doesn't require pre-aligning brain and image representations, which is an additional compute cost in the conventional approach.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms underlying the directional cilia orientation are unknown. Here we show that the primary cilia of pyramidal neurons are localized near the base of the apical dendrites and aligned on the nuclear side opposite to the axon initial segment (AIS). However, this pattern is not observed in atypical pyramidal neurons in the deep neocortex, excitatory neurons in non-laminated regions, interneurons, or astrocytes, where cilia are irregularly positioned around the nuclei and lack preferred orientation. In Reelin-deficient mice (reeler), the directional orientation and apical location of cilia in late-born neocortical and CA1 neurons are disrupted. However, the initial impairments are partially corrected during postnatal development, along with a realignment of apical-basal orientation. In contrast, loss of Reelin drastically disrupts the directional orientation of cilia in early-born neocortical neurons and principal neurons in evolutionarily conserved cortical regions, which lack postnatal correction. Consistently, their cilia do not preferably localize to the apical side. Additionally, Reelin deficiency increases the cilia length of principal neurons across the cerebral cortex at a developmental stage when cilia stabilize in wild-type mice, but this effect is not observed in interneurons, astrocytes, or excitatory neurons in non-laminated regions. Together, Reelin controls the directional orientation, apical localization, and length of primary cilia in principal neurons in the cerebral cortex, underscoring the cilium as a key apical domain particularly prominent in late-born neurons.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Systematic screening of multiple sialic acid derivatives identifies PSA as uniquely effective in inducing anti-inflammatory polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Based on these findings, an injectable microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffold presenting PSA covalently via its reducing end (MAP-PSA) is engineered, recapitulating physiological glycan orientation.

Using ischemic stroke as a CNS injury model, MAP-PSA significantly reduces neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory activation while enhancing reparative macrophage and microglial phenotypes.

Understanding the molecular features that control axon growth potential is critical for uncovering how neural circuits form, mature, and respond to injury or disease. The Drosophila mushroom body (MB) offers a powerful model to dissect axon growth programs, as lineage-related Kenyon cells (KCs) undergo different developmental events under shared spatiotemporal conditions. During metamorphosis, {gamma}-KCs undergo axon pruning, followed by developmental regrowth at the same time-frame as /{beta}-KCs initiate axon growth - thus providing a unique opportunity to compare these distinct growth paradigms. We thus performed RNA-sequencing of /{beta}- and {gamma}-KCs during their initial growth and developmental regrowth, respectively, revealing dynamic transcriptional changes and identifying 300 shared genes upregulated during both growth states. A targeted loss-of-function screen revealed genes specifically required for either /{beta} initial growth, {gamma} regrowth, or both. Focusing on one such candidate, Pmvk, we found that it plays a crucial role in axon regrowth by acting within the mevalonate pathway. Notably, other enzymes in this pathway were also required, suggesting that the entire metabolic pathway is essential for supporting regrowth. Genetic mutant analyses and rescue exepriements suggest that Pmvk likely controls axon regrowth via Rheb, an effector of the TOR pathway, which we previously found to be required for regrowth. Our developmental transcriptomic atlas not only advances understanding of intrinsic axon growth programs, but also provides candidate genes and a valuable framework for future studies aimed at enhancing axon regeneration in the adult nervous system.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

To clarify the ancestral function of Notch, we turned to an early branching Metazoan -- the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi -- and conducted structural analyses of putative Notch components to evaluate predicted signaling potential. We characterized gene expression of these components with in situ hybridization and show they are expressed during late embryogenesis. Using hybridization chain reaction (HCRTM), we examine MlNotch expression relative to canonical transcriptional targets and putative stem cell markers and identify differential expression patterns at a cellular resolution. Pharmacological inhibition reveals zones of active and inactive MlNotch during late embryonic development.

While PARP inhibitors have shown remarkable clinical benefit, particularly in BRCA -mutated tumors, the lack of discrimination between PARP1 and its close homolog PARP2 often leads to hematological toxicity and limits treatment efficacy. Therefore, achieving molecular selectivity for PARP1 remains a central challenge in the rational design of safer and more potent inhibitors. Here, we perform atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using potential of mean force (PMF) calculations, energetic decomposition, and targeted in silico mutagenesis to dissect the molecular determinants underlying PARP1 versus PARP2 selectivity across four representative approved compounds. Our simulations of the catalytic domain were used to quantify residue-ligand contact frequencies, ligand-induced modulation of protein flexibility, and the free-energy landscapes governing binding and unbinding processes. Contact analysis identified key residues mediating ligand recognition, while energetic decomposition characterized the dominant stabilizing forces inducing ligand-protein interactions. Importantly, our PMF profiles revealed distinct energetic and molecular features of association pathways responsible for ligand selectivity. Our results demonstrate that selective inhibitors stabilize unique PARP1 interactions and follow favorable low-barrier association routes, whereas the same ligands encounter higher barriers in PARP2.

Detailed analysis of these natural scans confirmed model predictions, including how scan structure depends on oscillator phase, goal-heading deviation, and navigational uncertainty. Furthermore, the model reveals that simple modulation of forward speed unifies a broad range of behaviors across ant species, from dashes to smooth oscillatory trajectories to pirouettes and voltes.

Yet the mechanisms linking HSD17B13 activity to fibrogenic progression remain poorly understood. Here, we show that both wild-type and catalytically deficient HSD17B13 (mHSD) localize to lipid droplets (LDs) in cultured human hepatocytes, but only catalytically active HSD17B13 enhances hepatocellular lipid accumulation and markedly upregulates the lipogenic transcriptional regulator carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP).

Building on existing techniques, we showed that BAL is a reliable, accessible source of primary human epithelial cells, yielding airway and alveolar organoids within 10 days. Organoids can then be expanded over many passages for downstream analysis. Our streamlined methods do not require cell sorting or other complex procedures, all cells are derived from a single patient, and media are based on serum-free, chemically-defined formulations. Here, we present detailed protocols for organoid establishment, standardized passaging and phenotyping, and differentiation of both airway and alveolar models. We provide a time course of BAL-derived airway organoid differentiation at air-liquid interface, and we demonstrate proof of principle for differentiation of BAL-derived alveolar organoids in 3D culture. These methods can be readily adapted to generate and characterize organoids from lung tissue, tracheobronchial specimens, or other primary cells from humans or mice, expanding the potential to use lung organoids for disease modeling.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

A.; Hammarlund, M.; Bartolini, F.; Yogev, S.", "abstract": "Neuronal function and survival depend on highly stereotyped non-centrosomal microtubule (MT) arrays. How these arrays form remains poorly understood. Here we identified a role for SCAPER and TTC5, two factors previously implicated in tubulin mRNA autoregulation, in controlling neuronal MT content through {gamma}-tubulin-dependent nucleation. In C. elegans neurons, loss of scpr-1, ttc-5, or both reduced MT numbers to a similar degree as depletion of {gamma}-tubulin, the main MT nucleator. Using conditional single-cell degradation alleles and endogenous tagging, we find that {gamma}-tubulin nucleates MTs in the neuronal cell body from endosomal puncta, and that scpr-1 and ttc-5 are required to recruit {gamma}-tubulin to these structures. SCPR-1 is also instructive, as its overexpression drastically increases {gamma}-tubulin levels and enhances MT density. We propose that these mechanisms are conserved since human SCAPER rescues C. elegans mutants, and SCAPER knockdown in rat hippocampal neurons reduces both {gamma}-tubulin clustering at presynaptic sites and activity-dependent synaptic MT nucleation. Finally, while scpr-1, ttc-5, and{gamma} -tubulin are not required for developmental axon elongation, they are essential for regeneration, where SCPR-1 directs {gamma}-tubulin to the growth cone to facilitate regrowth following injury. These findings reveal mechanisms governing neuronal cytoskeleton assembly and function, and suggest potential crosstalk between tubulin autoregulation and microtubule nucleation.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Viewing repetitive striped patterns can induce pattern glare, experienced as visual discomfort (VD). While previous studies examined either pupillary responses or VD separately, few have investigated how they covary or evolve with repeated exposure. This study tested whether pupillary dynamics could serve as an objective Aversometer - a physiological marker of individual visual sensitivity beyond subjective reports. Across four experiments (preliminary: n = 97; main: n = 70 for spatial frequency, n = 46 for central field size, n = 36 for central blank, with partial overlap), we manipulated spatial frequency, central field size, and surround field size of square-wave gratings (0.5-3 s) while measuring both discomfort and pupil size. Higher spatial frequencies and larger pattern areas elicited stronger pupillary constriction and greater discomfort, whereas repeated exposures produced cumulative increases in discomfort and decreases in baseline pupil size, consistent with visual strain rather than adaptation. To assess the potential of pupillometry as an aversometer, we examined individual differences in the main spatial-frequency experiment (controlled viewing distance, n = 42). A paradoxical pattern emerged: within participants, stronger stimuli produced greater constriction, but individuals with higher overall discomfort showed weaker constriction and stronger late redilation. Similar dissociations between subjective sensitivity and pupillary responses have been noted in studies of light-induced discomfort, suggesting that related mechanisms may contribute, although their specific physiological basis remains unclear. Overall, our findings clarify how pattern-induced discomfort evolves over time and across individuals and highlight pupillometry as a potential as a sensitive, objective tool for assessing visual sensitivity.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Here we show that loss of MBD7 rescues transcriptional defects at a large subset of MBD5/6-bound loci. Using simultaneous profiling of DNA methylation and transcription in single pollen nuclei, we found that MBD5/6-bound loci that are actively demethylated in immature VN lose additional methylation in mbd5/6, prior to transcriptional derepression. A subset of these loci is also bound by MBD7, correlating with demethylation and transcriptional derepression in mbd5/6 that are both reversed by loss of MBD7. Conversely, ectopically recruiting the MBD7 complex to MBD5/6 targets causes partial demethylation and upregulation.

Despite its essential developmental role, LSD1 inhibition has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance retinoic acid (RA)-responsive gene expression in subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we show that LSD1 physically interacts with RAR/RXR heterodimers at specific genomic loci, restricting chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation of differentiation programs. Single-agent inhibition of LSD1 or HDACs promotes only partial differentiation. In contrast, Corin, a dual LSD1/CoREST inhibitor, synergizes with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to induce robust myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Corin treatment alone does not significantly increase H3K4me3 levels; however, in combination with ATRA, it disrupts CoREST-RAR/RXR complexes and facilitates the recruitment of the coactivator p300. Together, they shift chromatin to an active state, enhancing H3K4me3 via increased transcriptional engagement and coactivator recruitment. Our findings identify the functional antagonism between CoREST and p300 as a regulatory axis of RA signaling in AML. Targeting this mechanism with Corin and ATRA re-sensitizes non-APL AML cells to RA-induced differentiation, suggesting a broader therapeutic approach for overcoming resistance in ATRA-refractory leukemias.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

A key limitation lies in their reliance on masked language modeling, which is well suited for generative language tasks but poorly aligned with learning rich cell-level embeddings required in single-cell biology. Moreover, the proliferation of transcriptomic technologies, from whole transcriptome dissociated assays to image-based targeted profiling, poses a major challenge for cross-platform generalization. Here, we align with recent advances in machine learning to move beyond reconstruction metrics, which often do not capture important sample variation. We present scConcept (contrastive cell pre-training), a transformer-based contrastive learning framework that directly optimizes cell embeddings by contrasting multiple views of cells. By replacing gene-level reconstruction with a cell-level identification task, scConcept learns robust representations that are invariant to count distributions and gene panel selection, across diverse assays and technologies. To highlight the capability of the proposed framework, we pretrain scConcept on a similar corpus of over 30 million single-cell RNA-seq profiles as recent foundation models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance not only compared to state-of-the-art pretrained foundation models but also domain-specific methods in various downstream tasks, including cell-type annotation, technology integration, dissociated to spatial cell-type transfer, spatial imputation, gene panel optimization, and mapping new technologies on already existing atlases.

This uncovered consistent synergy between menin and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibition, including with the clinical agent iadademstat. Mechanistically, LSD1 was found to interact with LEDGF, a chromatin-anchoring cofactor of the menin-KMT2A complex at H3K36me3 marked euchromatin. Chromatin profiling revealed extensive co-occupancy of LSD1 and menin-MLL components at leukemogenic loci in MLLr AML cells. Dual inhibition of menin and LSD1 dismantled this chromatin complex, evicted H3K36me3 from LEDGF-bound sites, and reprogrammed transcription toward myeloid differentiation. Combined menin and LSD1 blockade repressed canonical MLL targets such as HOXA9, MYC, FLT3, PBX3, and CDK6 while restoring H3K4me3 deposition and activating differentiation-associated genes. In vivo, the combination produced potent antileukemic effects in both MOLM-13 and MLL-r patient-derived xenografts, markedly reducing leukemic burden and extending survival without overt toxicity.

These genome-free particles self-assemble in a cell-free protein synthesis system from modular, de novo gene fragments encoding only structural and antimicrobial proteins. Using Enterobacteria phage T7 and its susceptible bacterial host as a model, we test the hypothesis that POPs stochastically encapsulate small antimicrobial proteins during self-assembly and deliver them into bacteria during adsorption via an ejectome-mediated injection mechanism. A computational survey of T7 small proteins revealed early and mid-genome enrichments of hypothetical proteins and capsid volume sufficient to accommodate multiple small proteins in the absence of the ~40-kb genome. In time-series antimicrobial susceptibility assays (48-72 h), POPs produced initial growth inhibition comparable to wild-type T7 at the highest doses with a linear dose-effect relationship and a minimum inhibitory concentration-like threshold.

Using a sequential protein extraction approach combined with a species-specific protein database, we identified over 2,000 proteins, uncovering key regulators of maturation, stress tolerance, and germination. Seeds that reached maturity at 6 weeks displayed a high accumulation of proteasome components, translation machinery, and stress-associated proteins, notably late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) and heat shock proteins (HSPs), underscoring their role in seed development. Polyamine profiling showed that high putrescine levels were associated with early development and reduced germination, while spermidine and spermine were correlated with maturation, tolerance to desiccation, and germination. The decreases in certain proteins and polyamines during the transition to germination reveal dynamic regulatory shifts essential for the establishment of seedlings.

ANG2 has thus emerged as a potential target for HHT treatment. Here, we report the development of a peptide vaccine (ANG2-P3:CRM197) that selectively targets ANG2 over ANG1 and tested its effectiveness in decreasing retinal AVMs in neonatal mice injected with BMP9/10 blocking antibodies, a model of HHT. Litter groups from female C57BL/6 mice immunized with ANG2-P3:CRM197 received injections of anti-BMP9/10 antibodies, and their retinas were examined for vascular pathology. The potential toxicity of the vaccine was evaluated in females 12 months post-immunization through echocardiography, basic metabolic panels, and lipid profiles. Circulating anti-ANG2 antibodies were detected in nursing neonates of vaccinated females, with antibody levels comparable between litters and their dams, indicating effective antibody transfer from the dams. A significant decrease in AVM number and size was observed in the retinas of pups exposed to ANG2-P3:CRM197 antibodies compared to unexposed pups. Arterial and venous diameters were normalized in the vaccinated pups retinas. The vaccinated females showed no abnormalities in cardiac, liver, or kidney functions.

However, signal degradation for individuals with dark skin tones can compromise PPG quality and pose challenges for equitable sensing. Aim: We develop a dual-wavelength, polarization-sensitive PPG device to assess perfusion index (PI) across a range of skin tones. Approach: To evaluate the impact of polarization on PPG signal quality, we record PI for co-polarized (polarized illumination and parallel-aligned polarized detection), and cross-polarized conditions (polarized illumination and orthogonally aligned polarized detection) at 655nm and 940nm in participants representing light, medium, and brown skin tone categories. Skin tone classification are based on the individual typology angle (ITA) values derived from the CIE L*b* color space measurements. Results: At 940nm, light from the cross-polarized light channel significantly increases PI (p<0.05). At 655nm, cross-polarization presents a statistically significantly enhanced PI (p<0.05) relative to light from the co-polarized illumination condition, although the magnitude of the improvement decreases with lighter skin tone indication a possible interaction between skin tone and polarization. This improvement is consistent across all skin tones. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the cross-polarized condition improves PPG signal quality by reducing the influence of superficial scattering and enhancing deeper vascular signals. This approach may be especially beneficial for individuals with darker skin tones and offers a promising path towards more robust and inclusive physiological monitoring using PPG-based technologies.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

The different phenotypic characteristics of the synucleinopathies Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) have been proposed to originate from the distinct structures adopted by Syn in its amyloid forms. Here, using covalent labeling and limited proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) in vitro and in situ within neuronal cells and directly in native patient brain homogenates, we show that pathogenic Syn from distinct synucleinopathies (PD, DLB and MSA) are structurally different. Further, we found that fibrillar structural differences are associated with different fibril interactomes and neuronal responses. We discovered disease-specific ubiquitination patterns and turnover profiles for pathogenic Syn species, detected molecular pathways responding specifically to the uptake of different Syn fibrillar polymorphs, and identified a subset of the involved proteins as candidate direct interactors of Syn. In particular, components of the Ubiquitin-proteasomal System (UPS), including E3 ubiquitin ligases, chaperones, and Deubiquitinating proteins, showed disease/polymorph-specific interaction patterns, possibly accounting for different resistance of patient-derived Syn fibrils to degradation. Genetic modulation with CRISPR-based tools showed that members of the UPS degradation pathway (three E3 ligases: UBE3A, TRIM25, HUWE1 and the AAA+ ATPase VCP) reduced Syn inclusions, in a strain-specific manner. LiP-MS also identified sets of proteins with altered protease susceptibility in postmortem brain homogenates of PD, DLB, and MSA patients. These sets were largely disease-specific and included proteins altered in cells treated with fibrils derived from patients with the matching disease.

Clinical features of ZSDs include seizures, leukodystrophy, renal and liver dysfunction, skeletal abnormalities, and they usually result in death during infancy or early childhood. There are no treatments for ZSDs, and their rarity, the large size of the PEX genes, and the numerous different genes, has impaired therapeutic development. We previously demonstrated that ATAD1, a mitochondrial protein quality control chaperone, could correct both mitochondrial and peroxisomal phenotypes in PEX3 patient fibroblasts. In this study, we investigated whether overexpressing ATAD1 could provide similar benefits in PEX1 and PEX6 patient cell lines, which account for over 70% of ZSD cases. We used established PEX6-/- HEK293 cells, patient-derived fibroblasts with pathogenic PEX1 mutations, and newly created zebrafish mutants. Lipidomic profiling of the cell lines demonstrated widespread dysregulation, including accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholines with very-long-chain fatty acids, depletion of plasmalogens and cholesteryl esters containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a decrease in cardiolipins. Overexpressing ATAD1 partly corrected these imbalances, including normalizing VLCFA metabolism in PEX1 fibroblasts and restoring plasmalogens and cardiolipins in PEX6-deficient cells. Mitochondrial function analysis (Seahorse XF) showed that ATAD1 increased basal and ATP-linked respiration in both PEX1- and PEX6-deficient cells, sometimes surpassing the effects of PEX gene re-expression. ATAD1 increased peroxisome numbers in both PEX6 and PEX1 cells. Zebrafish Pex1 mutants exhibited impaired maximal respiration despite normal basal activity, confirming mitochondrial vulnerability in vivo. These findings further confirm a role for ATAD1 as a modifier that improves lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and peroxisome abundance that could function across multiple ZSDs.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

It has recently been used in major crossbreeding programs, notably with Italian Simmental, to produce the Simgud hybrid. These initiatives aim to combine the exceptional adaptive traits of Gudali with the superior productive performance of Simmental. However, the genomic impact of such crossbreeding on both adaptation and performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated candidate signatures of selection and their associations with quantitative trait loci (QTL) and functionally important genes in the genomes of Gudali and Simgud. Our findings provide insights to guide reasoned, targeted breeding strategies that enhance productivity in tropical environments while preserving adaptive potential. Results: From a dataset of 539 Gudali and 139 Simgud genotyped with the GeneSeek GGP+ Bovine 100K array, we performed a two-step imputation to whole genome and used the resulting dataset to detect candidate selection signatures using Tajima D, the integrated haplotype score (iHS), the fixation index, and the cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XPEHH). Combining the identified regions under selection, together with gene expression and quantitative trait loci (QTL) databases, we further investigate the genomic targets of natural and artificial selection, and to identify functional candidate genes underlying adaptation mechanism. In general, the regions under selection were associated mainly with immunity, food scarcity, thermotolerance and various production traits as important selection targets. For instance, signals detected on BTA5 and BTA7 shared between Gudali and Simgud harbored many olfactory genes (OR2O2, OR7A94, OR7H5P) and taste receptors in Simgud (TAS2R42 and TAS2R46) essential to detect forages and predators in grazing lands. Analyzing 27 tissues, we found that the genes within the regions under selection were mostly enriched for those overexpressed in testis, lung, kidney and hypothalamus. Conclusion: By integrating signatures of selection with information from QTL and gene expression, we identified four genes whose relevance was supported not only by selection signals but by additional functional evidence. For instance, GAB2 for response to trypanosome infection and EYA1 associated with heat/drought adaptation, both needed to thrive in challenging tropical environments.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

A major contributor to low assembly accuracy is the difficulty in accurately determining transcript start sites (TSSs) and end sites (TESs), due to the weak and noisy signals typically found in RNA-seq data. We present Telos, a two-stage machine learning framework for precise detection of TSSs and TESs and for transcript ranking. The method takes as input any assembly, typically generated by an existing assembler. In the first stage, Telos scores the TSSs and TESs in the input assembly using a machine learning model trained on a rich set of engineered features. These site-level scores will be passed to the second stage for transcript-level evaluation. In its second stage, Telos scores the entire transcripts by training another model that integrates features of their TSS and TES (including the inferred probabilities from the first stage), along with transcript abundance estimated by the assembler and statistics about exon lengths. We extensively evaluated Telos on ONT (cDNA and direct RNA), PacBio, and Illumina short-read RNA-seq datasets. In all cases, it consistently outperformed baseline methods. Telos is agile, but achieves substantial improvements, demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling TSS and TES, a gap in current transcript assembly tools. Telos can be paired with any assembler %to identify reliable TSSs and TESs and to accurately score the assembled transcripts. It is modular, easily extensible to emerging sequencing technologies, and hence we anticipate its broad adoption in transcriptomic studies.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Current databases such as ClinVar and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) attempt to catalog this knowledge but have significant limitations: ClinVar depends on voluntary submissions and covers only a fraction of published literature, while the academic version of HGMD is updated infrequently and provides limited functional annotation. To address these gaps, we developed PubMind, an AI-driven multi-layer framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to extract variant-function-disease associations and supporting evidence from text. PubMind integrates a fine-tuned BERT model for input triage with instruction-tuned GPT models for inferring disease associations and functional annotations. The system captures diverse variant types--including SNVs, CNVs, SVs, and gene fusions--and normalizes records to genome and transcriptome coordinates. Benchmarking demonstrates >90% accuracy in variant recognition and 99% precision in disease extraction. Application of PubMind on >41 million PubMed abstracts and >5 million open-access full-text articles produced PubMind-DB, a database containing ~1.3 million unique variants with rich contextual annotations, accessible via a web interface and API. Only ~10% of PubMind's variants overlapped with ClinVar entries, yet >80% showed concordant pathogenicity labels, including full agreement with ClinVar's expert-reviewed variants.

The transcription factor SOX10 is crucial for CM initiation and survival, making it an interesting candidate for new targeted therapies, but its relevance in UM was unclear. We found that SOX10 was widely expressed in UM and essential for proliferation, cell cycle progression, and survival. The effects were partially mediated by SOX10-related genes including MITF, highlighting high addiction of UM to the SOX10-MITF axis. Additionally, SOX10 knockdown induced massive transcriptomic changes. Due to a lack of specific inhibitors of SOX10 and MITF, a computational approach was used to identify druggable targets by curating a UM-specific protein interaction network to search for candidates downregulated upon SOX10 inhibition. Thereby, the E2F transcription factor family was identified and their potential as druggable target candidates in UM was confirmed using the pan-E2F inhibitor HLM006474, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, SOX10 is crucial for UM survival and SOX10-associated proteins may serve as promising targets for developing new therapeutic strategies in UM.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

While recent machine learning (ML) approaches often rely on bulk omics lacking spatial resolution or histology-based multiple instance learning (MIL), spatial transcriptomics (SpT) provides a unique opportunity to capture both molecular content and tissue architecture. However, no generalizable ML framework has yet been established to exploit SpT for patient-level outcomes. We present SpaMIL, a flexible and interpretable MIL framework designed for SpT, with a distillation strategy that enables deployment for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides alone. We evaluate the framework by predicting survival from glioblastoma (GBM) patients, a clinically compelling setting given its aggressiveness with a median survival of only 15 months and the lack of prognostic clinical variables. We analyzed 76 GBM cases from the MOSAIC dataset: 43 with matched SpT, H&E, single-nucleus RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), bulk RNA-seq, and clinical variables, and 33 with H&E for external validation. We developed two main architectures: abMIL, tailored to SpT's spatial molecular structure, and MabMIL, which distills SpT-derived representations into H&E. Model interpretability was achieved through a Shapley-based framework linking prognostic predictions to cell-type compositions via SpT deconvolution. In benchmarking across the five GBM MOSAIC modalities, SpT-based abMIL achieved unprecedented prognostic accuracy (median C-index: 0.72, standard deviation: 0.04), outperforming all other modalities, including established clinical predictors. PCA and deconvolution-based SpT representations surpassed recent foundation models, suggesting the need for further research on SpT foundation models. Our interpretability analysis highlighted malignant and non-malignant cell subpopulations associated with favorable or poor prognosis, consistent with recent reports.

Structural studies establish a ping-pong mechanism, but most mathematical models still assume sequential binding, lacking mechanistic justification and overlooking the alternation of a single binding site. Here, we present the first mechanistically derived and thermodynamically consistent model of SLC25A10 based on the ping-pong framework. The model incorporates competitive dicarboxylate binding, phosphate exchange, heteroexchange, reversibility, and electroneutrality, and is validated against experimental data. To estimate kinetic parameters and quantify their uncertainty, we employed Bayesian inference, enabling statistically rigorous calibration to competition assays. The model introduces new terms that quantify which substrate and from which side of the membrane is most likely to start the transport cycle. Beyond reproducing rapid exchange of different substrates that cannot be directly measured experimentally, the model captures the influence of mitochondrial morphology, enzymatic interactions, and metabolic perturbations on transporter behavior. Specifically, simulations reveal that swelling of the matrix and intermembrane space dilutes metabolite pools, reduces gradients, and decreases SLC25A10 fluxes. Moreover, the model demonstrates how SLC25A10 contributes to succinate handling under SDH deficiency, functioning both as a gatekeeper and a pressure-release valve for matrix succinate. Under these conditions, succinate accumulates and is exported into the intermembrane space via SLC25A10, a process critically dependent on phosphate and malate availability.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We applied our model to the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset comprising 3,508 children aged 9-11 years and revealed two reproducible brain-behavior dimensions that captured variation in cognitive control and emotion-attention regulation. These dimensions further yielded three distinct biotypes, each exhibiting unique symptom profiles and distinct brain development. We tested the robustness and generalizability of the dimensions and corresponding biotypes in an independent cohort of 224 age-matched participants from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and documented their early expression before symptom onset during adolescence.

Descending exercise or central command signals from hypothalamic and brainstem regions are thought to activate thoracic spinal sympathetic neurons in parallel with descending locomotor commands. In turn, subsets of thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) then increase activation of a constellation of tissues and organs that provide homeostatic and metabolic support during movement and exercise. It is known that neurons within the spinal cord (propriospinal networks) can generate well-coordinated and sustained locomotor activity but whether these propriospinal networks contribute to coordination between locomotor and autonomic systems is unknown. To investigate this, we applied neurochemicals to elicit whole-cord or lumbar-evoked locomotor activity in an in vitro spinal cord preparation, simultaneously recording lumbar ventral root (VR) activity and changes in calcium fluorescence of pre-labelled SPNs in thoracic segments. Using whole-bath drug application to elicit hindlimb locomotor activity, recorded SPN responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) compared to caudal (T8 to T11) segments. When locomotor-inducing neurochemicals were applied only to the lumbar region using a split-bath configuration, SPN population responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) but not caudal (T8 to T9) segments during both tonic and rhythmic VR activity. In both approaches, the greatest numbers of SPNs with increased fluorescence during rhythmic activity were in T6/7, whereas the greatest numbers with unchanged or decreased fluorescence were in caudal segments (T8 to T11). Together these findings reveal a strong ascending lumbar to thoracic integrating communication pathway and may represent a key feature of spinal neural network function normally. Such communication pathways should be further investigated for targeted autonomic function(s) activation and therapeutic benefit after spinal cord injury.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We discovered that MEIS2 is aberrantly expressed in bone marrow myeloma cells (BMMC)s, and that high MEIS2, CDK4 or CDK6 and low CRBN expression predisposes patients to inferior overall survival in IMiD therapy. Inhibition of CDK4/6 (CDK4/6i) reprograms BMMCs for IMiD vulnerability ex vivo that mimics patient's response to IMiDs. Mechanistically, CDK4/6i both rapidly accelerates the displacement of MEIS2 from CRBN by IMiD and destabilizes the MEIS2 protein while increasing the CRBN protein in cooperation with IMiD and CELMoD. This enhances CRL4<CRBN/SUP> ubiquitination of IKZF3 and IKZF1 for degradation that exacerbates the loss of IRF4 to relieve IRF7 for induction of the interferon response, culminating in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, MEIS2 promotes BCMA expression and antagonizes repression of BCMA by IMiD and CELMoD for survival of myeloma cells.

C.", "abstract": "We sought to better understand the neural representation of visual motion acceleration. A straightforward estimation of acceleration would involve calculating the rate of change of velocity, which itself would be calculated from change in position over time. As it is well-established that neurons in area MT encode velocity, the brain could thus indirectly estimate acceleration by calculating the change in MT's velocity representations. An alternate mechanism, however, could operate more rapidly and directly. In this case, the brain could exploit interactions between MT's standard motion encoding and idiosyncratic temporal dynamics of neural responses. Such direct decoding would thus exploit nonlinearities usually ignored in studies of MT coding. We tested between these two theories by measuring from ensembles of MT neurons while two male awake fixating macaques viewed linearly accelerating motion stimuli. Direct decoding of acceleration from MT was possible on faster time scales, and could be done with higher fidelity, than indirect decoding. Distinct motion acceleration information could thus be efficiently read out from rich and heterogeneous MT ensemble responses, regardless of the mechanisms that give rise to various forms of motion tuning that it exhibits. A similar analysis of activity in the medial superior temporal area (MST) did not suggest this later stage of motion processing has a more refined acceleration representation. Together, these results suggest that the brain may opportunistically exploit nonlinear idiosyncrasies of neural responses to efficiently extract behaviorally relevant information on fast time scales, instead of performing explicit calculation of some variables.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Using high-resolution imaging with electron microscopy, we examined cells exposed to alpha-synuclein fibrils vs control cells with a focus on mitochondria.

Here we report that the intracellular domain of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR/CD118) is essential for mature RGCs' ability to regenerate injured axons independent of the cognate ligand (LIF) and other therapies. Overexpression of LIFR in adult RGCs induces neurite outgrowth in cultured RGCs and axon regeneration in vivo while strongly amplifying RGCs' response to LIF itself and to unrelated growth factors. Conversely, in loss-of-function studies, down-regulation of LIFR eliminates the pro-regenerative effects of Pten deletion and other potent stimuli. LIFR bidirectionally regulates the constitutive activity of the MAP kinase pathway, in contrast to LIF itself, which primarily activates pSTAT3. Expression of a truncated LIFR lacking the extracellular domain is sufficient to promote axon regeneration and selectively increases the survival of particular RGC subtypes, placing the LIFR intracellular domain as an essential, cell-autonomous regulator of optic nerve regeneration.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Conserved elements have been a mainstay of comparative genomic research, and can be further investigated for specific-specific sequence acceleration to dissect the genetic basis of trait evolution. The conclusions of these comparative genomic studies are however contingent in on the number and range of species included in this phylogenetic analysis. One group of species that has been largely under-represented in genomic comparisons are the marsupials, due to the dearth of marsupial genomes in most publicly available whole-genome alignments. In this study, we firstly showed how biased phylogenetic distributions can profoundly affects estimations of conservation/acceleration with a focus on the marsupials. Then we present a bioinformatic workflow that rapidly enabled us to map 13,287 vertebrate conserved elements--a majority of which were intergenic --identified from the 60-species whole-genome alignment of vertebrates (containing only 4 marsupials) to up to 12 new marsupial genomes (\"Lift\"). Following this, we combined these new marsupials sequences back to multiple species alignments of these conserved elements (\"Add\").

FlashRNA achieves comparable or slightly improved predictive performance compared to similar sized Borzoi or Flashzoi models, notably without depending on pre-trained weights, a major limitation of Flashzoi. Remarkably, we trained FlashRNA from scratch in one day on a single GPU, significantly accelerating training and inference speed. These improvements can facilitate further developments in models for regulatory genomics by reducing computational cost. We demonstrate this in two downstream applications: 1) we train a large ensemble of 16 FlashRNA models and distill them into a single model to improve performance while maintaining efficiency, and 2) we fine-tune FlashRNA on three prediction tasks, ChIP-seq, RNA half-life, and translation efficiency, achieving performance matching or exceeding state-of-the-art task-specific models.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

However, there is not yet a web-based tool that enables meta-analysis and visualization of TP53-related gene expression datasets, although several databases exist to access and annotate TP53 target information. To address this gap, we developed TP53-META, an interactive R Shiny based web tool that allows users to upload and simultaneously analyze user's or integrated public RNA-seq datasets for effects of TP53 depletion and/or induction on the transcriptome. Results: TP53-META can be used to visualize significant expression clusters as well as TF-TF, pathway-pathway, disease-gene and treatment-gene networks to determine TP53 dependency of selected treatment contrasts. We demonstrated the utility of TP53-META through two case studies. In the first, using an in-house RNA-seq data from MCF7 cells treated with siRNAs against CHRNA5 and TP53, we identified TP53-independent and dependent transcriptomic changes by CHRNA5 depletion by comparing with selected public datasets in TP53-META. In the second, we demonstrated the user data upload functionality of TP53-META before meta-analysis and extracted commonly modulated TP53-related genes in liver fibrosis using public RNA-seq datasets.

Recent observations have suggested that DFP has promising anticancer activities ascribed to several mechanisms including reduction of the intracellular free labile iron and zinc ion pools and inhibition of the activities of other intracellular targets, including ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). We previously reported that DFP inhibits the demethylase activities of several Fe(II)-ketoglutarate dependent histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) at much lower concentrations at which it inhibits RNR activities and/or reduces the labile intracellular iron and zinc ion pools. In this study, we used RNA sequencing (RNA seq) and PROTACs strategies to validate and quantify the contribution of intracellular KDM inhibition to the antiproliferative activities of DFP. We report herein that DFP elicited gene expression signature that is largely similar to that of JIB-04, an established KDM inhibitor (KDMi), in two breast cancer (BCa) cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MD-231). Importantly, RNA seq revealed that DFP and JIB-04 downregulated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF 1 alpha), an oncogene whose expression is commonly modulated through histone demethylation mediated by KDMs and degraded by several KDMi. Moreover, DFP-derived PROTACs elicited enhanced cancer cell selective antiproliferative activities and intracellular on-target effects, downregulating several KDMs implicated in the etiology of BCa cells, including a strong degradation of KDMs 2A, 3A and 5B, and a moderate degradation of KDMs 4A-C, 5C, 6B.

Here, we analyzed pre- and post-NAT samples from Chinese YBC patients using scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. We found that NAT reshaped the tumor microenvironment (TME), reducing epithelial cells and T cells while increasing endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Residual cancer cells showed enriched epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stromal remodeling programs. Good NAT responders had fewer luminal-like cells and retained basal-like cells in an early hybrid EMT state, whereas poor responders maintained both populations with late hybrid EMT. We identified therapy-resistant genes and motifs (e.g., VTCN1, PROM1, MZB1, Fox family) and linked CXCL13 upregulation to poor NAT response and tumor-specific T-cell expansion.

Direct testing on human or animal subjects is costly, time intensive, and constrained by ethical and safety considerations. To address these challenges, a low-cost, versatile brain phantom was designed to emulate key biophysical properties across multiple neuromodulation modalities. The phantom was fabricated using ground beef, sodium alginate, and starch, and cast within a custom 3D printed mold. A multimodal test platform was created and validated by integrating established principles from low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and thermal phantom design. Numerical simulations predicted a LIFU peak negative pressure of 0.631 MPa, closely matching the target Pr.3 value, with negligible temperature elevation (<0.01 {degrees}C). Consistent with prior reports, tDCS exposure did not induce lasting alterations in the phantoms physical or electrical properties. The electrical conductivity was 0.11{+/-}0.02 S/m, reflecting water saturation within the phantom matrix; the thermal conductivity averaged 0.557 W/(mK), consistent with reported values for brain tissue analogs. This study primarily evaluated LIFU and tDCS performance; future work should extend characterization to additional modalities such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Further assessment of the phantoms optical properties would also facilitate photobiomodulation and photoacoustic imaging studies.

Their expression is tightly regulated by mechanical load, yet the upstream enhancer mechanisms translating hemodynamic stress into transcriptional activation remain incompletely understood. Methods: We investigated the Nppa/Nppb super-enhancer (SE), which resides in a well-insulated topologically associating domain (TAD) and regulates stress-inducible expression of Nppa and Nppb. We applied CRISPR-based enhancer perturbation, chromatin accessibility and histone profiling, chromatin conformation assays, genetic mouse models, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and paired failing human hearts before and after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) unloading. Results: Through integrative epigenomic and genetic analyses, we identified a conserved element, CR9, as a dominant hub enhancer within this SE. In neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, CRISPR-based activation and inhibition established that CR9 was both necessary and sufficient for NP induction, whereas neighboring elements (CR7/CR8) displayed modest activity but synergized with CR9, establishing a hierarchical and cooperative SE architecture. In vivo, CR9 deletion in mice markedly suppressed Nppa/Nppb expression and diminished chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation across adjacent enhancers and promoters, underscoring its structural as well as transcriptional role. Reinsertion of CR9, even in reverse orientation, restored transcription, confirming its orientation-independent activity. CR9 function remained confined within TAD boundaries, supporting a locus-specific regulation. RNAscope revealed spatial proximity between CR9 enhancer RNA and Nppa/Nppb nascent transcripts. Developmental profiling revealed a switch in enhancer usage from CR6/CR7 in the fetal heart to CR9 in adulthood, indicating a transition from developmental to stress-inducible regulation. In human induced pluripotent stem cell?derived cardiomyocytes, deletion of CR9 nearly abolished NPPA/NPPB expression, establishing its essential role in a human cellular context. Most notably, in paired human failing hearts before and after LVAD unloading, chromatin accessibility at CR9 was dynamically reversed, providing the first direct evidence that enhancer states are plastic and therapeutically modifiable in the human myocardium. Conclusions: CR9 functions as a stress-inducible hub enhancer that coordinates NP transcription under pathological load. This enhancer exhibits reversible activation in human hearts, underscoring enhancer plasticity as a modifiable regulatory layer mediating stress-responsive transcriptional adaptation in the diseased myocardium.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Between May and July 2023, we conducted larval surveys in refugee settlements across Dadaab, Kakuma, and Kalobeyei (Kenya), collecting Anopheles larvae. Genotyping of 728 specimens revealed spatial variations in species composition. Overall, Anopheles arabiensis was the dominant species (59%, n=426), followed by Anopheles coluzzii (35%, n=252), and Anopheles rufipes (1%, n=7). In Dadaab, An. arabiensis was overwhelmingly dominant (94%, n=352/374). In contrast, the Kakuma/Kalobeyei complex was characterized by the co-occurrence of An. coluzzii (72%, n=252/350) and An. arabiensis (22%, n=74/350), with An. rufipes exclusively found in Kalobeyei (7%, n=6/89) (Figure 2B). Notably, no members of the Anopheles funestus group or Anopheles stephensi were detected. However, approximately 5% of the larvae across the sites could not be resolved molecularly. High frequencies of the L1014F kdr mutation, a pyrethroid resistance marker, were detected in An. coluzzii (Kakuma: 50%; Kalobeyei: 63%) and An. arabiensis (Kakuma: 10%; Kalobeyei: 30%) populations in Turkana County. Interestingly, no kdr mutations were observed in the An. arabiensis population from Dadaab. These findings highlight significant spatial diversity in vector species composition and resistance profiles, with An. coluzzii emerging as a dominant, pyrethroid-resistant vector in the Kakuma/Kalobeyei complex.

Eco-evolutionary processes drive patterns in species' abundances and traits. However, modeling complex ecological systems is challenging because of the many species and traits involved and because processes unfold in stochastic and non-equilibrium conditions. Gillespie Eco-evolutionary Models (GEMs) were created to simulate the eco-evolutinary dynamics in such complex scenarios. 2. GEMs bridge the gap between ecological and evolutionary timescales, enabling tracking of trait dynamics and abundances simultaneously, and allowing real-time feedback between the two processes. Designed to capture demographic stochasticity and individual trait variation, GEMs enable tracking of multi-trait and multi-species evolution. Originally designed for a quantitative genetics approach, GEMs have now been expanded to handle both quantitative traits and discrete traits (genotypes or strains). 3. In this manuscript, we introduce an optimized and accessible framework for GEMs developed in the Julia programming language. We have simplified the simulation setup process by placing many of the information containers and design structures into functions that adapt to the model configurations chosen by the user. We use a birth-death logistic growth model as an example to illustrate the GEM setup. 4. This user's guide is designed to make building GEMs for new models more streamlined and approachable.

Here, we address this challenge with an immunomodulatory cell-based therapy, in which alginate-encapsulated retinal pigment epithelial cells continuously secrete cytokines to locally modulate the implant microenvironment. In a healthy rodent model, the localized production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) or IL-12 from encapsulated cytokine-producing cells prevented host immune rejection and fibrosis of alginate capsules. Mechanistically, treatment was associated with reduced expression of pro-fibrotic genes and immune shifts consistent with macrophage and T-cell regulation, supporting a cytokine-mediated mitigation of foreign body response. In a diabetic murine model (streptozotocin-induced C57BL/6J), co-implantation of human islets with IL-10-producing cells attenuated pericapsular fibrosis, preserved islet viability, and restored normoglycemia for up to 100 days (4.76 times longer than islets alone). Significantly, IL-10-producing cells were also effective in enabling the durability and function of encapsulated cells in a healthy non-human primate, showing translational feasibility.

BDNF activates its receptor, TrkB, to induce local and long-distance signaling, promoting dendritic branching. While BDNF activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is well-documented in dendritic spines, its role in axons remains unclear. Using compartmentalized cultures of embryonic cortical neurons from mice, this study demonstrates that axonal BDNF triggers mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of translation regulators (4E-BP1 and S6), driving local protein synthesis. Fluorescent labeling, immunostaining, and radial microfluidic chambers were employed to isolate axonal compartments and assess local translation. Axonal BDNF increased Rab5 protein translation in a TrkB- and mTOR-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of localized protein synthesis for axonal trafficking. Furthermore, axonal protein synthesis was required for retrograde transport of internalized cargoes and CREB activation in the nucleus, linking local translation to long-distance signaling. These findings highlight the crucial role of axonal mTOR activation in regulating local proteostasis and neuronal function, offering new insights into axonal trafficking mechanisms and their implications for neuroplasticity.

Norepinephrine plays a key role in both hunger and alcohol-induced arousal and preference, but the circuit-level mechanisms through which it modulates the influence of hunger on alcohol preference are not well understood. We sought to address this using intersectional genetic tools for manipulating neurons expressing octopamine, the invertebrate analogue of vertebrate norepinephrine. We identified a single octopamine neuron required for ethanol seeking only when Drosophila are food-deprived. Hunger increased baseline activity in this neuron, making it more responsive to an odor cue previously paired with ethanol. A combination of genetic and connectome analyses revealed that synaptic partners of this octopaminergic neuron form a functional module that acts on Drosophila memory circuitry.

These disorders often share social deficits that may be effectively alleviated by psychedelics considering their use has been linked with emotional empathy and enhanced social cognition. However, the mechanisms through which psychedelics alter social behaviour are unclear, and mechanistic studies in animal models have largely focused on male subjects. This is problematic for understanding the therapeutic effects relevant for disorders that predominantly affect females, such as AN. Here, we used the activity-based anorexia (ABA) mouse model to examine the effects of a single psilocybin dose on social behaviour in female mice and compared outcomes to mice exposed to food restriction (FR), exercise (RW) or standard housing (Controls). Together with these metabolic stressors, we also investigated the effects of psilocybin on the circulating proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is implicated in AN and is suppressed by psychedelics. Psilocybin did not alter sociability in ABA, RW, or FR mice but increased preference for familiarity in Controls. Novelty-seeking behaviour was elevated in both ABA and RW groups, although with distinct social patterns. Psilocybin elevated IL-6 levels in RW mice, which was positively correlated with preference for novelty. No such relationships were found in ABA or FR groups. These findings reveal subtle, context-dependent effects of psilocybin on social behaviour and inflammation in female mice, highlighting the need to clarify its temporal, neuroplastic, and immune-related mechanisms across sexes and disease models.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

This finding has significant implications for our understanding and conceptualisation of memory taxonomies but has not been replicated. Here, healthy adult participants (N = 125) completed a word list and motor sequence task in counterbalanced order with either a shared or distinct sequence structure. In contrast to Mosha & Robertson (2016), we found that a shared ordinal structure between the declarative and motor sequence tasks did not facilitate performance.

{"title": "Drift-diffusion dynamics of the hippocampal replay", "doi": "10.1101/2025.10.14.682470", "authors": "Wu, Z.; Wei, X.-X.", "abstract": "Replay activities in the hippocampus and other brain regions during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are thought to play important roles in learning, memory, and planning. Surprisingly, the question of how to characterize the dynamical structure of replay remains controversial. Standard methods rely on restrictive assumptions for detecting replay events with high sequentiality, and they have substantial drawbacks. To fill this gap, we develop a flexible and highly interpretable computational framework based on state-space modeling to understand the dynamics of replays. This framework is motivated by the basic idea that sequential structures can be modeled using drift-diffusion dynamics. The two parameters (i.e., drift & diffusion parameters) can be directly mapped to the speed and variability of a replay event, respectively. To capture the potentially rich neural dynamics during SWRs, our model allows the switching between several well-motivated types of dynamics. The resulting framework enables precise and unambiguous interpretations of the dynamics of SWR events. Applications of our method to population recordings from the rat hippocampus lead to insights into a number of important open questions, including: (i) whether the speed of most replay events is comparable to real-world running; (ii) whether replays follow random walk; (iii) whether \"preplay\" events exist. More broadly, accurate characterizations of replay dynamics may lead to a better understanding of the role of replay under normal and abnormal conditions.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Oral vaccines offer an alternative to injectable options owing to their ease of administration; however, existing platforms fail to confer robust protective systemic and mucosal immunity. Here, we used engineered outer membrane vesicles (rOMVs) displaying the desired vaccine antigens, and derived from hypervesiculating probiotic E coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) [36], which elicits both mucosal and systemic immunity when administered orally. Using such approach, we attempted to formulate rOMV based single Oral vaccine against Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV), which pose significant risks to the poultry sector. We engineered rOMVs to display the antigenic regions of immunodominant Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) and Viral Protein 2 (VP2) of NDV and IBDV, respectively, on their surface, with sizes less than 150 nm and considerable polydispersity. The Oral administration of these rOMVs expressing the HN and VP2 induced a robust immune response which shows enhanced production of high-titer antigen-specific sIgA and IgG, which were able to neutralize the virus effectively in an in-vitro infection model system. While the poultry pathogens such as NDV and IBDV served as a model, the rOMV-based platforms hold considerable potential for the development of a multivalent oral biotherapeutic agent, including vaccines against a wide range of emerging human and animal pathogens by engineering rOMVs to display immunodominant antigenic portions, demonstrating its capability as a next-generation oral vaccine discovery platform.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Members of the claudin family of tight junction proteins regulate apical epithelial cell behaviors at all steps of neural tube development. We discovered that CLDN3, expressed in the non-neural ectoderm but not the neural ectoderm, is required to mediate neural fold fusion in chick embryos, particularly in the spinal region of the embryo. Depleting CLDN3 affects apical protein localization and apical domain morphology. Here, we used live imaging to re-examine the process of neural fold fusion in the cranial and spinal regions of the embryo and assessed biomechanical parameters of the non-neural ectoderm that are dependent on CLDN3. Our live imaging confirmed previous reports that unlike neural fold fusion in the cranial region and posterior neuropore, the spinal region does not depend on progressive fusion driven by zippering cell behaviors but instead fuses in a multi-step process where contact occurs simultaneously at multiple points along the anterior-posterior axis. We and others refer to the process of spinal neural fold fusion as buttoning to highlight the differences in cell behaviors from those observed during zippering (van Straaten et al., 1993). CLDN3-depletion decreased the rate of progression of neural fold buttoning within the spinal region. Using cell segmentation analyses we confirmed that CLDN3 depletion decreased the apical cell area of cells at the edges of the neural folds but not of lateral cells in the non-neural ectoderm. CLDN3 depletion increased pMLC staining within the apical domain of the cell, coinciding with a decrease in cell area, suggesting increased epithelial tension. Laser ablation studies revealed that the non-neural ectoderm of CLDN3-depleted embryos exhibits higher tension during neural fold fusion. We showed that treatment with the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin is sufficient to partially rescue the neural fold fusion defects in CLDN3-depleted embryos. This work provides further evidence for the importance of non-neural ectodermal tissue tension in neural fold fusion and suggests that loss of CLDN3 may alter tissue tension through cytoskeletal regulation pathways within the apical domain. This work supports that CLDN3 contributes to neural fold fusion and epithelial tissue tension during neural fold fusion via modifications to the apical cytoskeleton.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Despite its significance, gene regulatory mechanisms controlling the totipotent cell stage are poorly understood.

Using a combination of genomics approaches, we found that NACC1 directly binds to gene-regulatory regions and favours chromatin accessibility to induce the expression of totipotency and zygotic genome activation genes, as well as retrotransposons associated with totipotency. In parallel, NACC1-regulated retrotransposons further modulate the expression of proximal totipotency genes, forming a coherent feed-forward mechanism that regulates totipotent-like cells. Furthermore, NACC1 is crucial for the progression of embryogenesis beyond the totipotency stage.

Inevitably, the large spatial extent of this event substantially impacted coral reefs worldwide, and data are needed to quantify bleaching trajectories and coral mortality. In northeastern Peninsular Malaysia, heat stress accumulated to record levels by June 2024 (DHW=9.6 {degrees}C-weeks), resulting in severe mass coral bleaching. Here, we quantified species-specific bleaching and mortality trajectories for 12 abundant reef-building coral species of the genera Acropora, Diploastrea, Echinopora, Heliopora, Montipora, and Porites, by tracking 1850 tagged colonies from September 2023 to October 2024 using a novel Colony Bleaching Response Index (CBRI) that considers scales of discoloration and colony surface extent. In June 2024, 92.9% of all surveyed corals were bleached, resulting in 40.6% mortality by October 2024. However, bleaching trajectories varied across species, whereby the least bleached species in June were not the first to recover nor the least affected by mortality, suggesting inherent species-specific bleaching trajectories and recovery pathways. Mortality of Porites cf. lobata and Diploastrea heliopora was less than 1%, whereas severe mortality was recorded for Acropora species (five species, range 46.3-95.4%), Echinopora cf. horrida (44.7%), and Montipora cf. aequituberculata (27.8%). Among susceptible species was Heliopora coerulea, a species commonly considered heat tolerant. Our findings challenge previous regional studies that concluded a reversal of bleaching hierarchies of species over time, whereby historically ascribed heat tolerant species (i.e., slow-growing massive species) became susceptible and historically susceptible fast-growing species became heat tolerant. Importantly, bleaching severity did not decrease with depth. These data represent the first regional accounts of species-specific coral bleaching mortality in Malaysia, highlighting distinctive ecological bleaching and recovery trajectories of species", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We discovered that while abiotic gradients of known importance in this ecosystem were the strongest predictors of many plant species distributions, microbial predictors could have similar or greater influence. Microbiome predictors were collectively more important than abiotic environmental variables for 38% of plant species in this study and explained >70% of the predicted distribution for one species. We identified four microbiome attributes of landscape-scale importance for predicting plant species distributions including prokaryotic richness, fungal richness, the abundance of fungal pathogens, and the abundance of prokaryotic phosphate transport genes in soil.

Universal 'off-the-shelf' kits, such as Angiosperms-353, are cheap and readily available but are considered to expose insufficient variation below the species level, because they are designed to target highly conserved regions. However, this remains to be tested in a direct comparison with customised approaches below the species level. In this study, near-identical genotypes from both herbarium and fresh material of the common dandelion (apomictic lineages in Taraxacum officinale F.H.Wigg.) are characterised with customised and universal approaches of target capture sequencing. An RNA-bait panel was designed to capture (i) highly variable loci normally obtained with a Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) approach customised for dandelions; (ii) custom selected genes with potential for environmental adaptation, likely to harbour intraspecific genetic variation; (iii) conserved exons from universal kits (Angiosperms-353; Compositae-COS). Although exons from universal kits yield considerably less intraspecific genetic variation than both customised approaches, they still provided sufficient genetic variation to discriminate between near-identical genotypes of the same apomictic lineage. Given that universal kits save time, money, and the need for genomic reference data, this approach is recommended to increase the number of samples under budgetary constraints while still capturing considerable levels of intraspecific genetic variation.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Investigating MSR in invertebrates such as the western honeybee (Apis mellifera), an insect with advanced cognition, is essential to understanding the evolutionary origins and potential convergent evolution of self-recognition. We conducted two experiments using a classic mark test, applying a paint mark to the clypeus, a body part invisible to the bee without a mirror, and compared head-directed grooming between bees with and without mirror access. In Experiment 1 (n=12), without prior mirror exposure, bees did not increase their total grooming activity, although they did groom for a significantly higher proportion of time while facing the mirror. In Experiment 2 (n=9), bees with prior mirror exposure showed significantly higher total grooming activity than controls, an effect driven by an increase in grooming while facing the mirror. However, the critical test for MSR, a direct comparison of grooming while facing the mirror versus facing away from it, was not significant in either experiment's mirror group. Our findings suggest the observed behaviors are not indicative of MSR. Instead, they are better explained by simpler mechanisms, such as an orienting response to a novel stimulus (Exp 1), generalized agitation from a perceived social stimulus (Exp 2), or tactile irritation from the mark itself, an interpretation consistent with findings in other invertebrates. This exploratory research, limited by small sample sizes, provides preliminary yet inconclusive evidence. We discuss our results in the context of key methodological prerequisites for the mark test, such as mark salience, and the broader possibility that MSR-like behaviors reflect a learned perceptual-motor skill rather than an abstract self-concept. Thus, this study contributes not by providing a definitive answer, but by highlighting these critical challenges and establishing a rigorous framework for future investigations designed to disentangle these alternative hypotheses.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is known to regulate the process of endochondral ossification in mice by non-enzymatic repression of the activity of the RUNX2 transcription factor (TF) and to control cardiac metabolism in physiological stress situations. In this study, we examined the function of somatic HDAC4-902 frameshift (fs) mutations that are frequently observed in gastric and colon adenocarcinoma patients. Whether these mutations lead to a gain- or a loss-of-function is currently unknown. Here we generated a murine model bearing a germline HDAC4- methionine (M) amino acid (AA) 902-to-histidine (H) frameshift (M902Hfs) mutation. HDAC4-M902Hfs mice phenocopied HDAC4 null mice and present with premature ossification and early postnatal death. Mechanistically, we found that the HDAC4-M902Hfs mutation induced nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, resulting in loss of HDAC4 protein. This loss-of-function (LOF) effect was further supported by increased mRNA and protein expression of runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2) and reduced class IIa HDAC enzymatic activity, indicating that HDAC4 contributes significantly to endogenous class IIa HDAC activity. Patient-derived data suggest that the HDAC4-902fs mutation is associated with reduced mRNA expression of HDAC4. In conclusion, our study identify that HDAC4-902fs mutation is a loss-of-function mutation, but raises the new question whether the loss of non-enzymatic mechanisms or the reduction in class IIa HDAC activity contributes to tumor progression.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Based on mutual prediction theory (interacting individuals simultaneously process their own behavior and predict their partner's; accurate mutual predictions lead to convergent neural representations and thus IBS), this study hypothesized that higher stimulus uncertainty enhances IBS (heightened uncertainty reduces independent predictability, promoting convergent representations and stronger IBS). Using information entropy to quantify uncertainty, the study conducted hyperscanning, manipulated entropy across Resting State and 6 Hz auditory stimuli (ASSR, MMN, AHER, Dream Wedding), and measured IBS via phase-locking values (PLV). Results showed frequency specificity: 6 Hz PLV increased with entropy (DW {approx} AHER > MMN {approx} ASSR > Resting State); Alpha band had highest PLV in Resting State. Critically, PLVs differed significantly between any two conditions, and each experimental condition's PLV was also significantly different from that of the Resting State.

Prdm12 is prominently expressed in developing somatosensory ganglia, where it plays a crucial role in nociceptive neuron development, its expression being maintained in mature C-LTMRs (C-low threshold mechanoreceptors) and nociceptive neurons. Despite enhanced understanding of Prdm12's role in neuronal excitability and pain behavior, the impact of Prdm12 overexpression in mature nociceptive neurons has not been explored.

Furthermore, studies investigating the effect of psychedelics on visual function have all been done using head-fixed preparations, preventing animals from engaging in the natural visual behaviors that the visual system evolved to support. To determine the impact of psychedelics on active vision, we recorded neural activity in primary visual cortex (V1) of mice during free movement, while simultaneously recording eye and head position, before and after administration of the serotonergic psychedelic DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine). We find that DOI increases the frequency of visual active sensing behaviors during free movement and leads to a net reduction in the visually-evoked activity that these behaviors generate in V1. The effect of DOI was highly diverse across the population of V1 neurons, driving suppression and facilitation of visual responses in a laminar specific manner.

Adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure has been shown to induce long lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments in patients and rodent models that increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). Our previous work shows that these behavioral deficits coincide with persistent dysfunction of astrocytes. Here, we aim to understand how astrocyte synaptic structural and functional crosstalk are disrupted following AIE to provide better mechanistic understanding of why behavioral impairments persist into adulthood. Male Sprague Dawley rats received AIE, a variety of adeno-associated viruses encoding astrocyte specific sensors, and fiber implantation in the dorsal hippocampal (dHipp) for in vivo photometry. A subset of rats received hM3D(Gq) to chemogenetically activate astrocytes. Following AIE and a forced abstinence period that allowed growth into adulthood, rats underwent assessment in the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) task with simultaneous fiber photometry recordings. By combining immunohistochemistry (IHC), Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy, fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and slice physiology, we show that AIE induces structural and functional decoupling of astrocytes from synapses and astrocyte dysregulation that persists into adulthood. Remarkably, stimulating astrocytic calcium signaling via chemogenetic activation attenuates heightened fear responding and restores gliotransmitter availability. These findings highlight a critical role for astrocyte synaptic crosstalk in regulating fear learning and underscore the untapped therapeutic potential of targeting astrocytes to improve behavioral outcomes following substance use.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

ARHGEF17, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor regulating RhoA activation and cytoskeletal dynamics, has been identified as a potential IA risk gene. METHODS: CRISPR-Cas9-generated ARHGEF17-/- mice and morpholino-based ARHGEF17-deficient zebrafish were used to assess in vivo vascular effects. An elastase/DOCA-induced IA model evaluated aneurysm formation, rupture, and survival. Vascular remodeling of the Circle of Willis was analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence. Endothelial function was examined in HUVECs with lentiviral ARHGEF17 knockdown. Activation of RhoA/ROCK2/MLC signaling was assessed by G-LISA and Western blotting, with Y-27632 used to test ROCK2 dependence. RESULTS: ARHGEF17 deficiency increased IA incidence and rupture, accompanied by elastic fiber fragmentation, VSMC dedifferentiation, and inflammatory activation. Zebrafish lacking ARHGEF17 exhibited intracranial hemorrhage and vascular instability. In endothelial cells, ARHGEF17 silencing impaired proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and barrier integrity while activating the RhoA/ROCK2/MLC pathway.

CONCLUSIONS: ARHGEF17 maintains cerebrovascular integrity by regulating RhoA/ROCK2/MLC-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics. Its deficiency drives endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and IA formation, while ROCK inhibition reverses these effects, identifying the RhoA/ROCK2 axis as a therapeutic target for ARHGEF17 mutation-associated IAs.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We examined the effects of such filters on color salience for normal trichromats, using a visual search paradigm where the task was to locate a color target superimposed on a variegated chromatic background, similar to foraging for fruits among foliage. Background colors varied along a bluish-yellowish or purplish to yellow-green (short-wave cone isolating) axis, roughly spanning the range of dominant color variations in arid or lush environments. Target colors sampled a wide range of hue angles and contrasts. Testing was conducted on a computer monitor, with the filter effects simulated by calculating corresponding chromaticities with or without the filter for naturalistic (Munsell) reflectances. The filter evaluated (Enchroma SuperX glasses) was designed to increase color contrast along a magenta-green axis. Consistent with this, search times for targets on the blue-yellow background were significantly faster for the filter condition, because the filter increased the target-background color difference. Alternatively, overall differences in search times were not observed for the S-cone background. The differences on the two backgrounds could be qualitatively accounted for by the relative salience of the stimuli predicted by a perceptual color space (CIELAB). Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the filters for enhancing visual performance for normal trichromats and naturalistic tasks, and illustrate how these effects depend on the potential color characteristics of the environment.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy, characterized by the pathological accumulation of tau protein. While tau reduction has emerged as a promising disease-modifying strategy, most preclinical studies have focused on preventive approaches, and the therapeutic potential after clinical onset remains largely unexplored. This limitation is critical, as patients are typically diagnosed after symptoms emerge. Furthermore, global tau suppression may disrupt physiological tau functions and lead to adverse effects, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. RNA-based therapies, particularly microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing, offer high specificity, versatility, and sustained target knockdown. Here, we developed artificial microRNAs (Tau-miRNAs) designed for site-directed expression to selectively reduce tau levels in vulnerable brain regions, thereby minimizing off-target effects. We tested the efficacy of Tau-miRNAs in a tauopathy mouse model at advanced disease stages, delivering them into the prefrontal cortex after cognitive and electrophysiological deficits had developed. This post-symptomatic intervention led to long-term improvements in memory, restoration of neuronal firing properties, and reduced pathological tau at synapses. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of spatially targeted RNA-based tau-lowering strategies for late-stage intervention in tauopathies, addressing a critical unmet need in the treatment of these devastating disorders.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

However, the specific activity of identified cortical neurons during the paroxysmal oscillations associated with absence seizures (ASs) in awake animals remains underexplored. The dominant narrative suggests that seizures indiscriminately disrupt cortical activity through generalized hyperexcitability, but direct evidence supporting this view is lacking. Here, we recorded single units from pyramidal neurons and different interneuron subtypes in the neocortex of two validated rodent models of absence epilepsy under awake, behaving conditions. We find that neurons maintain their firing rank order across interictal and ictal states, regardless of whether their ictal firing rate increases, decreases, or remains stable compared to the interictal phase. Rather than a random cortical takeover, ictal activity represents a scalable modulation of pre-existing network states. These results challenge the generalized hyperexcitability model and highlight the structured, heterogeneous nature of cortical activity during ASs, with implications for mechanistic understanding and targeted therapies.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

The question of how we can entertain no thoughts while awake is challenging for the study of spontaneous thinking. By combining EEG-fMRI with experience sampling during task performance, we categorised changes in mental content and self-reported vigilance to map the neurophysiological signatures of MB. We demonstrate that fMRI connectivity around MB reports is characterised by a \"rich\" pattern of long and short-range signal anticorrelations. At the same time, sleepiness reports are linked to a \"simpler\" hyperconnected fMRI pattern, characterised by overall positive connectivity. Put together, an interaction appears: when people report being alert, connectomes around MB reports resemble the hyperconnected pattern, indicating that the neuronal correlates of MB depend on self-rated vigilance. The hyperconnected pattern also correlated with EEG slow wave activity, tying MB's topology to sleep-like electrophysiology during wakefulness. Collectively, we show that distinct cortical events underlie the shared phenomenology of a thought-free mind. We conclude that MB's neurophysiological correlates vary across perceived vigilance levels and that more refined characterisation of the neuronal correlates of thought-less mental states exist. Our findings build on the quest to bridge mental content and its absence with measurable brain activity and provide insights into how ongoing thinking is maintained during wakefulness.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

TCR:ICOS T cells demonstrated remarkable improvement of anti-tumor efficacy resulting in long-term cures and significantly delayed tumor recurrence, which were consistently accompanied by prolonged persistence of TCR-T cells in blood. Regressing tumors displayed an inflammatory phenotype driven by TCR:ICOS T cells that, upon antigen encounter, showed enhanced NF{kappa}B signaling, cytokine production and resistance to exhaustion. The use of an ICOS signaling mutant demonstrated that durable anti-tumor effects in vivo and in vitro relied on the PI3K-NF{kappa}B pathway. To adapt TCR:ICOS to human T cells, we iteratively tested gene variants and observed that a single amino acid change in the cytosolic tail was necessary for functional expression of this TCR. Moreover, human TCR:ICOS improved the in vitro performance of T cells upon repeated stimulation across multiple clinically relevant antigen specificities.

Extensive agonist analysis based on this model revealed that 2',3'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (2',3'-cGMP) serves as a natural ligand for mTLR8, suggesting functionality of its binding site 1 without engagement of site 2. In addition, 2',3'-cyclic uridine monophosphate, bacterial single-stranded (ss) DNA, double-stranded (ds) DNA fragments, microRNAs, ssRNA derived from HIV1, SARS-CoV-2, or bacterial sources all potentiate mTLR8 sensing of site 1 agonists.

During pregnancy, exposure to maternal HIV and a disrupted cytokine environment may impact foetal immune development and health outcomes through cytokine-mediated mechanisms. We evaluated (i) peripheral blood cytokine differences in pregnant women with and without HIV, (ii) longitudinal differences in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) and HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children, and (iii) latent cytokine groupings. Additionally, we explored the impact of maternal antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation timing on cytokine levels. Methods. We assessed 399 mother-child pairs in the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS), in pregnancy (n=179 mothers with HIV and n=220 without HIV) and their children at 6 weeks, 2-, 3-, and 5-years. Eighteen serum immune markers were quantified with ELISA and multiplex assays. Group differences were assessed with linear regression, and longitudinal analysis of child immune trajectories was evaluated with linear mixed models. Latent cytokine groupings were assessed using an integrated ANOVA framework with principal component analysis. Results. Pregnant women living with HIV had lower GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, NGAL, and MMP-9 levels, and higher TNF-, IFN-{gamma}, and sCD14 levels compared to women without HIV. HEU children had lower GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-1{beta}, IL-2, and IL-4 and higher sCD14 levels over time compared to HUU children and revealed distinct immunoregulatory profiles.

Given the close connection between metabolism and immune function, we investigated how meal timing affects acute and subacute forms of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in mice on normal (NC) and high-fat (HF) diet. Under conditions with ad libitum (AL) food access, HF diet resulted in increased ear thickness, leukocyte infiltration, pustule formation, IL-1{beta}, CXCL2 levels and markedly delayed resolution of the inflammation. Time-restricted feeding (TRF) reduced HF diet-induced weight gain and exacerbation of the inflammatory symptoms, even when started after disease onset. In HF-AL mice, serum leptin levels increased and exhibited a circadian phase shift compared to the NC group, whereas TRF significantly mitigated these alterations. NC-fed db/db mice that produced high levels of leptin exhibited worsened CHS. Blocking the leptin receptors alleviated the inflammatory symptoms in both db/db and HF-AL mice. Extending the analysis to human transcriptomic data and histology suggests that leptin may contribute to pustule formation in non-infectious dermatitis. In summary, our data indicate that both TRF and local inhibition of leptin receptors can individually and in combination serve as effective new tools in managing allergic contact dermatitis.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Molecular techniques such as amplicon sequencing are commonly used for this purpose. However, sampling procedures and DNA extraction methods, key steps in the sequencing workflow, vary often across studies, challenging comparability. We investigated two aspects of sampling preparation that may influence compost microbial analyses. For DNA extraction, often fine fractions (< 2 mm) are used. However, compost has a heterogeneous structure, including coarse particles. To assess the effect of particle size, we separately sequenced bacterial and fungal communities of the fine (0-2 mm) and coarse (2-10 mm) fractions of three composts. In addition, DNA was extracted using a carboxyl affinity-based magnetic method and a silanol affinity-based filter method to evaluate the impact of the extraction technique. We found that the coarse fraction had higher bacterial richness and a distinct bacterial and fungal community structure compared to the fine fraction. DNA extraction method also influenced bacterial community profiles, with the magnetic bead method improving coverage, particularly for Bacillota.

Current combination vasodilator therapies have markedly improved outcomes; however, prognosis remains poor in subgroups such as patients with respiratory comorbidities, highlighting the need for novel therapies. Elevation of intravascular hydrostatic pressure is a hallmark of IPAH, yet its direct role in PASMC pathobiology remains largely unexplored. We developed a cyclic hydrostatic pressurization culture system to model hypertensive hemodynamic stress in vitro and identify pressure-responsive mediators. Methods: PASMCs from 4 patients with IPAH were exposed to high hydrostatic pressure (70/40 mmHg, 60 bpm). Transcriptomic profiling identified differentially expressed genes, validated by qPCR. Functional studies included piezo-type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (PIEZO1) modulation, recombinant human stanniocalcin-1 (rhSTC1) treatment, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, and western blotting for cell-cycle regulators. In vivo, chronic hypoxia?induced pulmonary hypertension was assessed in wild-type and Stc1-/- mice by hemodynamic and histological analyses, with or without intratracheal rhSTC1 administration. Results: RNA sequencing revealed STC1 as a robustly pressure-induced gene in IPAH PASMCs. PIEZO1 activation upregulated STC1, whereas knockdown blunted this response. Elevated STC1 expression was observed in PASMCs of IPAH lung tissues, and rhSTC1 reduced PASMC proliferation and increased p-p53, p21, and p27 expression. In the chronic hypoxia model, Stc1-/- mice exhibited higher right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) (43.7 {+/-} 1.3 vs. 30.6 {+/-} 0.9 mmHg) and greater pulmonary arterial medial thickness (39.1 {+/-} 2.5% vs. 26.5 {+/-} 1.3%) than wild-type mice. CD68-positive macrophages were increased in Stc1-/- mice under normoxia and further elevated with hypoxia. In wild-type and Stc1-/- PAH models, intratracheal administration of rhSTC1 markedly reduced medial thickening, CD68-positive macrophage accumulation, and RVSP in both wild-type and Stc1-/- mice. Conclusions: We demonstrate that elevated hydrostatic pressure drives STC1 expression via PIEZO1, conferring potent anti-remodeling effects in IPAH.

To assess CAP2's role in the lens, we examined lens-specific CAP2 knockout (CAP2cKO) mice at cellular and tissue levels. CAP2cKO lenses were normal in size, shape, and transparency but exhibited increased stiffness under compression and enhanced recovery after load removal. While total actin levels and F-actin were unchanged, immunofluorescence revealed higher levels of Tropomodulin 1 (Tmod1, F-actin pointed-end capping), Tropomyosin3.5 (Tpm3.5, F-actin stabilizing), and T-plastin (F-actin bundling) in F-actin-rich membrane protrusions of mature fibers, while -actinin-1 (F-actin cross-linking) was reduced. These findings suggest that CAP2 loss disrupts F-actin remodeling, promoting filament stabilization through Tpm3.5 binding, Tmod1 capping and T-plastin bundling. Consequently, F-actin networks become stiffer and more resilient, altering lens biomechanics.

Keratinocytes from Stim1/2 cKO mice exhibited reduced Stim1 and Stim2 gene expression levels and impaired SOCE function compared with the controls.

By reducing the concentration of Activin A to 15% of the original protocol, efficient elongation of aggregated embryoid bodies was achieved. Also, titrating initial cell density and delaying the brief culture in GSK3 inhibitor until the onset of cell aggregation in individual wells was advantageous. Efficiency of formation of early gastruloids exhibiting the expected regionalization of the three embryonic germ layers was further enhanced by addition of TGF beta-inhibitor.

Resource acquisition shaped many aspects of past societies and influenced the development of trade networks and migration. Fish have been a cornerstone of human subsistence for millennia, yet the rise of commercial fishing and trade was complex. Here, we synthesised a database of ~1.9 million zooarchaeological fish records spanning 2000 years across Europe. Using machine-learning of catch compositions alongside fish thermal tolerances, we show that fisheries became less local over time, with homogenisation coinciding with Little Ice Age-associated cooling, a period of documented resource scarcity, concurring with growing trade. Moreover, increased proportions of marine taxa and more specialist marine fisheries were observed in the preceding Medieval Climate Anomaly, to sustain concurrent urban and population growth. Enhanced use of marine protein buffered food insecurity, whilst signalling the transition from localised to trans-regional trade networks.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

J.; Morton, S. G.; Shurin, J. B.; Rohner, P. T.", "abstract": "Microplastics are an emerging environmental hazard on a global scale. Their detection in agricultural environments is of particular concern not only for food contamination, but also because microplastics negatively impact detritivores and their ecosystem functioning. Dung beetles in particular provide vital ecosystem services in agricultural environments and are often vulnerable to anthropogenic hazards, but whether they are affected by microplastics remains unclear. Here, we test whether artificial contamination of cow dung with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) has the potential to affect the juvenile development and maternal behavior of the bull-headed dung beetle Onthophagus taurus. Dung beetles exhibited high mortality when exposed to elevated concentrations of TPU. In addition, females were equally likely to provision offspring with TPU-spiked (and lethal) cow dung as with control dung, suggesting that females cannot differentiate between highly toxic microplastic-contaminated and uncontaminated cow dung. Our findings highlight potentially severe consequences for dung beetles if microplastics persist and accumulate, although the levels of exposure in the field are unknown. Although the direct environmental hazards and the mechanisms mediating the negative impacts of TPU microplastics remain to be assessed, this study suggests that microplastics may negatively impact dung beetles and their ecosystem services. Future work assessing exposure levels in the field as well as dung beetles' potential to evolve resistance against microplastic pollution will be necessary to assess the long-term impact of microplastic presence on dung beetle ecosystem functioning.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Cephalochordates (also known as amphioxus or lancelets) are a group of marine invertebrates occupying a critical phylogenetic position as the sister group to the remaining members of the chordate phylum (vertebrates and tunicates). As such, amphioxus have been key to help understanding the origin and evolution of vertebrate genomes, the evolution of their development and the diversification of their anatomy. However, out of the three genera of amphioxus currently known (Branchiostoma, Asymmetron and Epigonichthys), most studies have focused exclusively on Branchiostoma species. Indeed, all amphioxus genomes published to date belong to the Branchiostoma genus. This implies that our understanding of cephalochordate biology is limited to findings from Branchiostoma alone. It is consequently difficult to infer from the currently available Branchiostoma genomes, what aspects of their gene composition and structure are genus-specific or ancestral to cephalochordates. Here, we provide new high-quality genome assemblies and annotations from representatives of both Asymmetron and Epigonichthys. Genome-wide phylogenetic analyses reveal that, in contrast to previous mitogenomic studies, Branchiostoma is the sister group to Asymmetron and Epigonichthys. We further uncover discordant gene histories between these three genera, with notable asymmetry in the distribution of gene trees with minority topologies. Lastly, we find that extensive gene births and duplications preceded the origin of modern cephalochordates.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "It is common for a host exposed to a pathogenic infection challenge to exhibit suppression of fecundity. This suppression can be driven by either a resource allocation-based trade-off between fecundity and immune function, or by infection-induced damage to host soma (particularly the reproductive organs). Alternatively, hosts can increase their fecundity to compensate for the curtailed lifespan resulting from lethal infection. Various factors, both extrinsic and intrinsic to the host, determine the actual effect of any infection challenge on host fecundity. While the host's physiological and abiotic environmental factors have been thoroughly explored in this context, the role of the host's biotic environment -- especially its social and sexual environment -- is rarely addressed. We investigated whether the socio-sexual environment (SSE) of D. melanogaster females influenced the effect of bacterial infection on their fecundity. We altered the socio-sexual environment of the females by housing them with different numbers of same-sex and opposite-sex companions. Our results indicate that while such alterations of the SSE changed the baseline reproductive effort of the females, they had no role in determining female susceptibility to infections or how infection affected female fecundity.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Over the past two decades, transgenic mosquito strains have been instrumental for studying mosquito biology and developing genetic control strategies such as gene drives. Mosquito transformants are typically identified using fluorescent markers which are assumed to be phenotypically neutral. While generating CRISPR-based gene drive strains with an OpIE2-DsRed marker we unexpectedly found that transgenic females were unable to blood-feed and were consequently sterile. Males, in contrast, appeared physiologically normal and fertile and enabled maintenance of the strains. Recognizing the potential utility of dominant, female-specific sterility for mosquito control, we established new strains controlling for transgene content and integration site, which confirmed that the specific OpIE2-DsRed marker was directly responsible for the blood-feeding defect. Behavioral assays showed that females exhibited normal attraction to a membrane feeder but failed to initiate blood-feeding, performing repeated cycles of probing and proboscis grooming in rapid succession before ultimately leaving the feeder unfed. Microscopic examination of OpIE2a females revealed a pronounced curvature of the proboscis. Similar malformations were also present in males and likely contributed to their reduced adult lifespan, overturning our preliminary conclusion of normal male fitness. A second promoter variant (OpIE2b), differing in flanking sequences at the IE-2 junction, drove bright marker expression without impairing blood-feeding or survival when integrated at the same genomic site. These findings demonstrate how minor differences in promoter architecture can elicit major, unexpected phenotypes. OpIE2b provides a robust, phenotypically neutral marker for An. gambiae research, while OpIE2a highlights the need for rigorous validation of transgenic components intended for research and applied releases.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Comparisons across species show pervasive losses, gains, and functional remolding at tRNA loci, indicating rapid evolution over intermediate timescales, but the underlying molecular changes happening over short timescales remain poorly understood. A central gap in our understanding is the nature of deleterious tRNA mutations, how they affect fitness, and the extent to which tRNA pools vary functionally across genomes. Furthermore, new technologies for capturing tRNA expression and modification emphasize the importance of tRNA activity to organismal fitness, as tRNA dysregulation is associated with disease burden in humans, but this research area has not yet included possible consequences of mutational variation. To infer the dynamics of tRNA evolution over short timescales, and to integrate our understanding of fitness consequences of tRNA regulation with mutation load, we first require a comprehensive view of standing variation in cytosolic tRNAs within populations. In this study, we resolve within-species allelic variation in nuclear-encoded tRNAs in three nematode species: Caenorhabditis elegans, C. briggsae, and C. tropicalis. We show that these tRNA repertoires have been shaped by transcription-associated mutagenesis and selection and exhibit extensive allelic variation, including isotype switching between tRNA backbones and anticodons, and genomic organization and patterns of variation that differ markedly from those of protein-coding regions.

While loss of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis conferred resistance to GA-DM, the disruption of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and the Hippo pathway genes sensitised cells to GA-DM. Inflammatory genes enriched at later time points suggests that a delayed cellular response contributes to cytotoxicity.

A.; Littler, E. A.", "abstract": "Significance: Fluorescence imaging remains largely qualitative and device-specific, limiting reproducibility and intersystem comparisons. Advancing toward quantitative imaging requires a radiometric characterization framework that provides SI-traceable units while explicitly addressing the interdependent factors that govern image formation. Aim: Establish and evaluate a radiometric characterization framework that converts device-native counts to SI-traceable imaged radiance (W{middle dot}m-2{middle dot}sr-1) and aggregate fluorescence yield (sr-1) while accounting for interdependent factors that influence fluorescence imaging formation. Approach: A calibrated Lambertian solid-state radiometric emitter target (RET) was combined with a three-step radiometric framework consisting of the Radiance Transfer Curve (RTC), the Radiance Imaging Transform (RIT), and the Fluorescence Imaging Transform (FIT). The RTC establishes system responsivity as a function of radiance; the RIT applies this calibration at the pixel level to map digital counts to SI-traceable radiance; and the FIT performs pixel-wise excitation normalization of the RIT image to produce an aggregate fluorescence yield image. The framework was tested through distance and aperture invariance, digital-vs-physical ROI analyses, RTC acquisition, and application of the RIT and FIT to an ICG concentration target and a breast lumpectomy phantom. Results: The RET exhibited Lambertian behavior, with no significant dependence of the measured radiance on distance or aperture; imager responsivity (R{lambda}) also remained invariant within uncertainty across working distances and f-numbers. Digitally masked ROIs reproduced R{lambda} obtained with matched physical apertures, enabling ROI and pixel-level radiance transfer. RTCs acquired over 49 radiances captured sensor and processing nonlinearities. The RIT provided a per-pixel mapping from counts to radiance (W{middle dot}cm-2{middle dot}sr-1). Applying pipeline-specific RTCs, the RIT and FIT reconciled large discrepancies across RAW, 8-bit, and log10 image processing pipelines, yielding closely aligned radiance-concentration curves and improved SBR/SNR/CNR agreement. In a breast lumpectomy phantom, FIT produced SI-traceable aggregate fluorescence yield yield produced SI-traceable (sr-1) images and absolute contrast metrics in an anthropomorphic geometry. Conclusions: The combined framework converts device-native counts into SI-traceable radiance and aggregate fluorescence yield at the pixel level, providing a practical basis for reproducible quantitative fluorescence imaging. The feasibility results across distance/aperture tests, ROI analyses, image pipelines, and phantom imaging indicate readiness for broader evaluation. Future work will establish formal uncertainty budgets and assess robustness across devices, geometries, and excitation conditions to support adoption as a quantitative reporting standard.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we address this gap by developing AdapSkin, an age adaptive, skin mimicking, bio adhesive, and stretchable polymeric electronic skin interface that seamlessly conforms to diverse skin properties, enabling high fidelity and high density electrophysiological recording.

The materials platform achieves extraordinary softness and electrical stretchability of up to 1200% through a double network composite structure. AdapSkin significantly minimizes age induced variations in interfacial impedance and signal to noise ratio (SNR), improving signal consistency for neuromuscular assessment, prosthetic control, and rehabilitation applications. Scalable fabrication enables the creation of large area electrode arrays, which reduces motion artifacts, improves sEMG mapping reliability, and ensures long-term signal stability across various age groups. Machine learning analysis further demonstrates AdapSkin's superior accuracy in gesture classification for elderly users, highlighting its potential to enhance prosthetic control, assistive robotics, and rehabilitation for individuals with sarcopenia and neuromuscular decline.

The need to bioinformatically process these phenotypes led to the development of a research field called image-based profiling. However, because the standard image-based profiling approach involves averaging data, single-cell quality control (QC) has been historically ignored. The conventional approach of aggregating single cells into bulk profiles conserves computational resources and reduces, but does not completely remove, the impact of low-quality single cells. As software improves in processing scalability, researchers increasingly use single-cell image-based profiling to reveal important signals of phenotypic heterogeneity. Therefore, this evolution of image-based profiling toward single cells compels single-cell QC standards to ensure that observed morphology differences are driven by biology and not technical interference. We address these challenges with coSMicQC (Single cell Morphology Quality Control), a reproducible Python package with comprehensive tutorials that supports systematic filtering of low-quality single cells. CoSMicQC integrates seamlessly into standard image-based profiling protocols, providing an interactive, Jupyter-compatible user interface to detect technical outliers and set automatic thresholds.

TAOK1 depletion stabilizes RFs and reduces replication-associated DNA damage in BRCA1/2-deficient cells, thereby conferring therapy resistance. Interestingly, we found that TAOK1 functions in RF regulation to be independent of its kinase activity. Instead, it interacts with PCNA and regulates ISG15 levels and thereby affects RF stability.

In this study, we report the identification of canonical and non-canonical BRAF mutations in ~1% of 5,779 consecutive clinically and molecularly fully-annotated AML patients treated at two major United States Cancer Centers (50/5779 AML patients: 21 newly diagnosed AML; 9 relapsed/refractory; 20 newly diagnosed secondary AML). We performed single-cell multiomic analysis on a subset of AML samples. BRAF mutations were enriched in myelodysplasia-related AML (AML-MR), and most mutations were located outside the V600 hotspot. Single-cell multiomic profiling delineated BRAF mutation class-specific patterns of co-mutations, clonality, and immunophenotypes. Notably, BRAF mutations and other signaling co-mutation(s) could be found in the same cell, a finding that significantly diverges from prior studies of RAS-mutant AML.

M.", "abstract": "Background Mavacamten, a first in class allosteric myosin inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM), notably reducing symptoms, left ventricular outflow obstruction, and wall thickness over 30 weeks. We recently reported that the MYBPC3:c.772G>A variant causes HCM through cMyBPC haploinsufficiency, leading to accelerated sarcomere kinetics and higher energy consumption in patient myocardium and hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC CMs). These effects are counterbalanced by prolonged action potentials and slower Ca2 transients, which preserve twitch duration but may increase arrhythmic risk. Mavacamten may reduce myocardial energetic defects in HCM. Objectives To investigate the long term effects of Mavacamten on sarcomere structure, contractility, and transcriptional remodeling using patient specific and CRISPR corrected isogenic hiPSC derived cardiomyocyte models of HCM. Methods HiPSC CMs and engineered heart tissues (EHTs) derived from a MYBPC3:c.772G>A patient and its CRISPR-corrected line were first exposed to increasing concentrations of Mavacamten to assess acute dose response relationships and determine IC50 values. Based on these data, chronic treatments (0.3 and 0.75 M for 20 days) were performed to evaluate mechanical, structural, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic adaptations. Results Acute exposure produced a rapid and fully reversible reduction in active force, while chronic treatment for 20 days induced a sustained decrease in contractility with incomplete recovery after 4 days of washout, indicating a two-phase mechanism of action. Long term force reduction was paralleled by decreased cell area and sarcomere density, indicating that structural disassembly contributes to sustained functional depression and re-assembly after washout. Electrophysiological analysis confirmed the specific alterations of the MYBPC3:c.772G>A mutation previously observed, with no detectable effects following treatment with Mavacamten. In addition, transcriptome analysis was used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the long term effect. Conclusions Mavacamten induces a biphasic, persistent to reversible, reduction of sarcomeric force associated with structural remodeling, providing mechanistic insight into its capacity to promote favorable cardiac remodeling in oHCM.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Grain development in rice generally spans over a month and has been divided into five stages, S1-S5, depending upon various morphological and physiological changes occurring in the developing seed. To completely understand the process, rice grain development needs to be examined at each stage. However, there are no detailed protocols available to demarcate grain developmental stages. Methods and Results- This protocol describes how to tag and harvest the developing rice spikelets. The process starts with anthesis and continues till seed maturation, demarcating the five stages of rice grain development. Seeds are collected, labelled, and stored for use in molecular experiments. Using this protocol, we were able to identify and distinguish different seed developmental stages as observed by histochemical screening. Conclusion- This is an easy, efficient, and cost-effective method. This protocol ensures the collection of the entire panel of rice seed developmental stages.

D.; Chen, T.-W.", "abstract": "Background: Vegetation indices (VIs) from remote sensing are widely used for non-destructive plant phenotyping, often averaged across plots or image regions to represent each plot. However, according to Jensen's inequality, which is known as the 'fallacy of the average', it can bias estimates when nonlinear relationships exist between VIs and target traits. To examine this issue, we systematically assessed the severity of this bias and tested a correction method. VI values were simulated using six beta distributions with varying shapes and skewness, and with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images from a paddy rice experiment to evaluate bias under real conditions. Nonlinear link functions (concave, convex, logistic) with different noise levels were applied to model VI-trait relationships. Result: The results showed that averaging under nonlinear relationships reduced predictive performance, lowering the coefficient of determination (R-squared) between true and predicted traits by up to 82%. In the rice NDVI simulation, R-squared was reduced by up to 58% around the tillering stage. Our correction method, which predicts traits from VI before averaging, substantially mitigated bias, improving R-squared by up to 0.68 depending on noise level, VI distribution, and link function. To facilitate application, we established an interactive R Shiny website enabling users to quantify potential biases and the efficacy of corrections within this workflow based on their own research conditions Conclusion: In summary, averaging VIs without accounting for nonlinear relationships can introduce substantial bias and degrade phenotyping accuracy. This bias should be explicitly considered in phenotyping analyses, and correction methods applied when appropriate to improve reliability.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

M. oryzae is a pathogen on many grass species, but the high host-specificity of blast isolates underscores the need to study pathogen diversity and virulence at the host level. Here, we fill a void on knowledge on finger millet- infecting strains of M. oryzae by sequencing 226 isolates pure-cultured from infected tissues, mainly peduncles and panicles, sampled from field-grown finger millet accessions across Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Phylogenetic analysis showed that eastern African isolates are genetically distinct from isolates from Asia, and group into two clades potentially driven by climate variables. One clade was dominated by isolates from Kenya and Uganda (KU clade), and the other by isolates from Ethiopia and Tanzania (ET clade). Analysis of the portfolio of 887 predicted effector genes showed that the KU clade had significantly fewer effectors, concomitant with higher virulence levels on the two finger millet accessions tested. We demonstrate that homologous recombination between transposable elements, leading to genomic deletions, plays a key role in gene removal. Transcript profiling of fungal genes in compatible and incompatible interactions revealed upregulation in the incompatible interaction as a characteristic of an estimated 30% of effector genes, including seven of the eight homologs of known avirulence genes from rice-infecting M. oryzae identified in our study. Prioritization of these effectors for functional validation will pave the way for identifying cognate resistance genes, and improving finger millet for resistance to blast disease.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

In this context, faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is highly valuable due to its capability to enrich soils with nitrogen and because its seeds have a high nutritional value. In this study, we compared the seed chemistry of 11 faba bean cultivars grown at 13 field sites in Germany. Nitrogen and sulfur contents were determined with the Dumas method and protein contents were calculated based on the obtained nitrogen data. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze proteins, while metabolic fingerprinting was applied to screen (semi-)polar metabolites, mainly comprising specialized metabolites. The protein content differed predominantly between cultivars, but also between field sites. The sulfur content strongly depended on the field site. The patterns of proteins and metabolites were largely cultivar-specific. Additionally, the number of metabolic features varied somewhat between field sites. Our study suggests that breeding led to comprehensive changes in the seed chemistry of V. faba bean, going far beyond protein content and certain metabolites targeted in breeding. The rather high consistency when comparing field sites indicates that breeding has led to more or less stable cultivars. Future studies should place more emphasis on far-reaching effects of breeding on the seed proteome and metabolome of faba bean, as various proteins and metabolites in concert determine the nutritional quality of seeds of this important crop species.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Energy deficits underlie many neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases implicating mitochondria as a potential therapeutic target. Iron is necessary for neuronal energy output through its direct role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Iron deficiency (ID) reduces mitochondrial respiratory and energy capacity in developing hippocampal neurons, causing permanently simplified dendritic arbors and impaired learning and memory. However, the effect of ID on early axonogenesis has not been explored. We used an embryonic mixed-sex primary mouse hippocampal neuron culture model of developmental ID to evaluate mitochondrial respiration and dynamics and effects on axonal morphology. At 7 days in vitro (DIV), ID impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity and stunted growth of both the primary axon and branches, without affecting branch number. Mitochondrial motility was not altered by ID, suggesting that mitochondrial energy production --- not trafficking --- underlie the axon morphological deficits. These findings provide the first link between iron-dependent neuronal energy production and early axon structural development and emphasize the importance of maintaining sufficient iron during gestation to prevent the negative consequences of ID on brain health across the lifespan.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Here we report that ectopic expression of the single bHLH factor, pancreas transcription factor 1 (PTF1A), is sufficient to drive radial glial progenitors (RGPs)-regardless of progenitor heterogeneity and developmental stage-to differentiate into glial cells. Ptf1a-expressing RGPs exhibit progenitor behaviors indicative of a neurogenic-to-gliogenic fate transition, resembling endogenous progenitors at the late stages of embryonic development, and preferentially produce OLIG2+ oligodendrocytes in vivo, some of which are positive for PDGFR or CC1. This robust gliogenic competency depends on the dosage of stable Ptf1a expression in RGPs. RNAseq reveals 'the glial transcriptome', including upregulated expression of several notch signaling components and the endothelin receptors in Ptf1a RGPs. We further identify Ednrb as one of the downstream targets of Ptf1a that directs RGPs toward gliogenesis via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In summary, our study uncovers a novel and robust role for Ptf1a in glial fate specification, offering a potential strategy for generating human oligodendrocytes in vitro.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

In mice and rats, both nocturnal species, most studies indicate that LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region is more robust when induced during the dark phase. Our examination of the underlying mechanisms at the CA3 to CA1 synapse provides evidence that the capacity to express LTP does not differ between the light and dark cycles of the 24hour day. Instead, the magnitude of theta-burst stimulation induced LTP (TBSLTP) correlates with daily fluctuations in the ratio of synaptic excitation to inhibition (E/I ratio): both the E/I ratio and TBSLTP are higher during the dark phase. Consistent with a causal relationship, blockade of inhibition abolishes the light dark difference in TBS LTP induction, likewise, pairing induced LTP, which is less constrained by inhibitory recruitment, does not differ between cycles. Supporting this model, using the APP/PS1 model of AD we observed that neither the E/I ratio nor TBSLTP change during the light cycle. Finally, we made the intriguing observation that these daily oscillations reverse direction after puberty in WT mice, shifting from being larger in the dark cycle of 2month old mice to being larger in the light cycle in 8month old mice. This developmental switch may reflect an age-dependent reorganization of circadian control over hippocampal plasticity.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies, such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, are used across multiple cancers, including non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), yet the transcriptional mechanisms that shape T cell responses in this context remain unclear. Here, we analyzed a publicly available squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) single-cell RNA-seq dataset comprising 25,581 tumor-infiltrating T-cell profiles to map differentiation trajectories before and after anti-PD-1 therapy. In CD8+ T cells, therapy enhanced the transition from memory to activated states, prominently involving IL-12-associated pathways, and revealed a distinct memory-to-exhaustion trajectory driven by EOMES and TCF7 regulatory activity. Gene regulatory network inference further revealed therapy-induced transcriptional rewiring distinguishing precursor exhausted (Tpex) from terminally exhausted (Tex) states. CD4+ T cell populations also underwent substantial reshaping, with trajectory and functional analyses highlighting therapy-driven programs that enhanced CXCL13+ Tfh responses while generating fewer but more transcriptionally active Tregs.

We found that the cytoplasmic ADAR1p150 isoform is essential for maintaining peripheral T cell numbers and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). In bone marrow transplants, ADAR1p150 protein, but not its editing activity, was crucial for T cell regeneration and HSPC repopulation, demonstrating a cell-intrinsic function in hematopoiesis.

In Converters, aNAVs expressed polyreactive, autoreactive IgM with distinctive V-J gene rearrangements that dominate the BCR repertoire. Furthermore, in Converters most IgM+ aNAVs were developmentally arrested in the peripheral blood, while a subset undergoes class switching and follows divergent somatic hypermutation trajectories.

Accurately quantifying DC Mtb remains an important research objective, with current approaches tending to combine Most Probable Number (MPN) assays and culture filtrate (CF) supplementation. These assume that growth is equiprobable across all bacterial inoculum densities - an untested assumption for Mtb. We performed a half-logarithmic dilution series of Mtb from 70,000-0 CFU/mL, culturing each inoculum in either standard 7H9 or CF and monitoring growth by optical density. Inocula of [&ge;]2,000 CFU/mL were 33 times more likely to grow than inocula of [&le;]700 CFU/mL. CF increased the odds of growth five-fold, and reduced the time-to-positivity by 294 hours (~12 days) compared to 7H9 alone. However, CFs growth-promoting effects diminished with increasing inoculum density, becoming negligible at 70,000 CFU/mL. Notably, CF broadly altered Mtb cell physiology, producing shorter bacilli that were less likely to incorporate the mycomembrane probe, DMN-trehalose. These data indicate that Mtb is poorly culturable from low inoculum densities - a limitation only partially overcome by CF. This non-uniform growth probability suggests that unsupplemented MPN assays may systematically underestimate Mtb CFU. Moreover, while CF promotes Mtb growth, its density-dependent activity and broader effects on cell physiology suggest that its influence extends beyond simply resuscitating DC Mtb. Improved methods are needed for detecting DC Mtb phenotypes, as these may support clinical care and shed light on factors that govern mycobacterial replication at different population densities.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

The TM mucin MUC1 has a highly O-glycosylated extracellular domain (ED) and a cytoplasmic tail (CT) with signaling potential. MUC1 is a target for the Salmonella adhesin SiiE, which mediates apical invasion of the bacterium into enterocytes. Here, we determined the contributions of the MUC1 ED and CT to Salmonella invasion and subsequent host immune responses. Enzymatic removal of the MUC1 ED from HT29-MTX intestinal cultures blocked Salmonella invasion to levels comparable to MUC1 knockout cells. CRISPR-mediated targeted deletion of the MUC1 CT (MUC1-{Delta}CT) did not quantitatively affect Salmonella invasion. To investigate downstream host responses, RNAseq transcriptomics analysis of uninfected and Salmonella-infected MUC1-WT, MUC1-{Delta}CT, and {Delta}MUC1 cultures was performed. Deletion of full-length MUC1 greatly altered the transcriptome, while only a small group of 132 genes was differentially expressed in MUC1-{Delta}CT cultures during infection. Several of these CT-dependent genes are related to the NF{kappa}B pathway. Immunoblot analysis demonstrates that under uninfected conditions, expression of NF{kappa}B subunits RelB, NfkB1-p105, NfkB2-p100, and I{kappa}B was significantly lower in MUC1-WT compared to MUC1-{Delta}CT and {Delta}MUC1 cultures. Secretion of cytokines and immune factors was severely reduced in {Delta}MUC1 cultures, coinciding with reduced Salmonella invasion. In MUC1-{Delta}CT cultures, only galectin-3 and IL-18 secretion were significantly reduced.

Although desmin knockout models and several truncating mutations typically result in a functional null phenotype without inclusion body formation, the molecular consequences of specific stop-gain variants remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the pathogenic mechanism of a novel DES nonsense mutation, NM_001927.4:c.448C>T; p.(Arg150Stop), previously identified in an Indian patient with congenital myopathy. This premature stop codon lies within the Linker 1A domain and is predicted to generate a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal tail. To delineate its functional consequences, we used two complementary experimental approaches: transient overexpression of the R150X mutant in skeletal and cardiac myocytes, and a CRISPR/Cas9-engineered homozygous R150X cardiomyocyte line (Des-R150X-CRISPR). Both models consistently revealed the formation of persistent aggregate-like structures, in striking contrast to desmin knockout systems that do not generate inclusions. These aggregate-like structures disrupted actin filament organization, impaired filament bundling, and induced organelle mislocalization. Biochemical analysis indicated that the aggregates were resistant to proteasomal degradation, yet they were partially cleared by autophagy, underscoring a role for protein quality control pathways in modulating disease severity. Importantly, the Des-R150X-CRISPR line demonstrated aggregate-driven pathology at endogenous levels, confirming that this mutation acts through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism rather than simple loss of desmin function. Our findings establish the Arg150Stop variant as a mechanistically distinct truncating mutation that generates aggregation-prone protein rather than a null state. By reproducing hallmark features of desminopathy in a physiologically relevant human cell models, this work not only broadens the known pathogenic spectrum of DES variants but also highlights aggregate formation as a central driver of cellular dysfunction and a promising therapeutic target in desminopathies.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Despite this success, rAAV-based gene therapies suffer from dose-limiting toxicities, resulting in several severe adverse reactions, including death. Previously, we discovered that rAAV rapidly kills mouse NPCs in vitro and in vivo. This vector contains a minimal genome comprised of 145-base pair inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) with a T-shaped hairpin structure that appears to be necessary and sufficient for this toxicity. However, the mechanism for AAV ITR toxicity is not known, and there have been few attempts to engineer ITRs to attenuate rAAV toxicity. In the current study, we explore the molecular mechanisms that drive dose-dependent rAAV toxicity in dividing human NPCs (hNPCs) and test whether disrupting these mechanisms mitigates this toxicity. Recombinant AAV infection induces aberrant cell cycle progression with activation of the ATM /CHK1/CHK2 pathway and expression of the DNA damage markers {gamma}H2AX and 53BP1. Affinity-based proteomics indicate that AAV ITRs bind to Poly-(ADP-Ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP1) and other DNA damage response (DDR) proteins involved in single-strand break repair (SSBR). Recombinant AAV infection attenuates poly-(ADP-ribose) (PAR) formation and mimics the antiproliferative effects of pharmacological PARP inhibitors used in cancer therapy. Moreover, treatment of hNPCs with PARP inhibitors is sufficient to reproduce many features of rAAV-induced toxicity. Finally, we demonstrate that eliminating the T-shaped hairpin within the AAV ITR reduces binding to SSBR proteins and the resulting rAAV toxicity. These findings suggest that rAAV infection induces replication stress and cell death in dividing hNPCs by functionally depleting PARP1 and other DDR proteins that are essential for DNA replication. This work fills substantial gaps in the understanding of the mechanisms of rAAV toxicity and has important implications for the development of safer rAAV-based human gene therapies.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Given that meiotic progression is essential for generating a fertilizable egg but does not affect hormone production, it represents a promising biological mechanism to target for female non-hormonal contraception. In this study, we developed a phenotypic screening platform modeled after biopharmaceutical industry practices using mouse oocytes to screen for compounds that block meiotic progression. Oocytes were matured in vitro in the presence of selected compounds from a bioactive compound library, and confirmed hits were identified as those that potently and reproducibly blocked meiotic progression.

Here, we employed flow cytometry to quantitatively analyze changes in cell size and DNA content in the aging Drosophila brain across specific brain regions, comparing the optic lobes (OLs) and central brain (CB). Our results reveal a large heterogeneity in brain cell size that is maintained during aging, despite an overall shift towards smaller cell sizes. This shift was observed early in the aging process and occurs similarly in OLs and CBs, with the OLs consistently exhibiting significantly smaller soma sizes than the CB. Simultaneously, we detected a significant, age-dependent accumulation of polyploid cells (cells with >2C DNA content), which was mostly evident in the OLs. Notably, although the polyploid cells are larger than diploid cells, the increase in polyploid cells was insufficient to counterbalance the age-related decline in cell size. This is in part because the average size of the polyploid cells also exhibited a decrease in size in the CB with age. We suggest that polyploidization exhibits region-specific differences with age, but that the age-associated loss of larger cells and cellular atrophy occurs across the brain and in polyploid as well as diploid cells.

Using a synthetic mRNA screen containing diverse miRNA-responsive elements, we uncovered miR-98-5p as a potent enhancer of resetting. Single-cell RNA sequencing and targeted perturbations show that miR-98-5p directly represses NR6A1 while transiently activating BMP2/4 signaling, triggering network transitions. These changes destabilize the primed gene-regulatory network and enable acquisition of a naive state. Leveraging this mechanism, we establish a feeder-free, miRNA-based, editing-free protocol that boosts resetting efficiency from <10% to ~80%.

Eyespot size plasticity is adaptive because the morphs function to avoid predation in their respective season. Eyespot size has been shown to be regulated by rearing temperature in many species. However, temperature is unreliable in some regions because it poorly predicts seasons, and other cues such as humidity may be more reliable. We investigated inter-population differences in cue use for eyespot plasticity in the butterfly Melanitis leda. We reared butterflies from three Indian populations under combinations of temperature and humidity. Butterflies from a population (Vithura) where humidity differentiates seasons but temperature does not, responded only to humidity. Butterflies from a population (Tirunelveli) where seasonality is not distinct, and where temperature and humidity are both unreliable, also responded only to humidity. Butterflies from another population (Coimbatore) where seasonality is not distinct, but where temperature has the highest intra-annual variation, responded only to temperature. This suggests local adaptation in cue use. Life-history traits also differed among populations, with the two populations from more arid regions developing faster and attaining larger body sizes than the one from the humid region. Fast development may be adaptive in dry regions where suitable host plants are available only briefly, while large body size may confer desiccation resistance.

Dry-season morphs of satyrines (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae) typically are cryptic with small or no eyespots on the ventral wing surface. In contrast, wet-season morphs have large eyespots on their wing margins. These eyespots deflect predator attacks away from vital body parts. Extensive studies have shown that eyespot size is influenced by the temperature experienced during larval development. Temperature-mediated eyespot size plasticity is adaptive in regions where temperature increases with the onset of the wet season. However, many tropical regions lack a reliable temperature-rainfall correlation, and thus, temperature may not always be a reliable predictor of the upcoming adult environment. A potential environmental cue that correlates strongly with seasonality is relative humidity (hereafter, humidity). With the approach of the wet season, humidity increases, and then declines with the onset of the dry season. Here, we tested whether humidity modulates eyespot-size plasticity in two sympatric butterflies that experience similar ecological pressures: Mycalesis mineus and Melanitis leda. We found that humidity directly influenced eyespot size in My. mineus; individuals reared at high humidity developed into adults with larger eyespots than those from low humidity. In contrast, eyespot size in Me. leda showed a weak direct effect of humidity. Instead, humidity modulated eyespot size in Me. leda indirectly through induced changes in the host plant quality. Since the late larval and prepupal stages are temporally closer to the adult environment, selection may favour greater sensitivity to the environmental cue during these stages than during early larval stages. To determine the humidity-sensitive phase, we conducted a switching experiment where humidity was shifted from low to high, and vice versa, at different developmental stages. We demonstrated that, in My. mineus, wandering larval and prepupal stages are sensitive to humidity, whereas the early-feeding larval phases are insensitive. Contrastingly, humidity switching did not influence the eyespot size in Me. leda.

Using saturation mutagenesis and sequence-barcoding-based quantification, we comprehensively mapped the response of the fitness landscape of TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase, which evolved against penicillin-class antibiotics, to mutational perturbations against six diverse {beta}-lactam antibiotics. This systematic panel of antibiotic substrates, including representatives from penicillin, cephalosporin, and monobactam classes, allowed us to classify resistance mutations into two categories. Generalist mutations conferred resistance to multiple antibiotics and were consistently restricted to three positions critical for substrate recognition and catalytic function R164, G238, and E240. These substitutions produced broad spectrum resistance through mechanisms such as expansion of the active site and improved substrate accommodation. In contrast, specialist mutations conferred resistance to only a single antibiotic and exhibited much wider positional diversity. Ceftazidime selection yielded the greatest number of distinct specialist mutations, which were frequently found in flexible or peripheral regions including the omega loop. One especially unexpected finding was the identification of the E166P variant. E166 is a catalytic residue required for deacylation during hydrolysis, and substitutions at this site are generally assumed to abolish function. However, E166P conferred a significant increase in ceftazidime resistance despite eliminating activity against penicillins. Molecular dynamics simulations and mutational analysis revealed that the E166P mutant employs an alternative catalytic mechanism, involving residue N132, rather than the canonical pathway. Together, our findings reveal, at the molecular level, how specialist mutations open up a wide range of diverse and idiosyncratic solutions at the expense of generalizability.

Here, we identified SPD-2, the conserved homolog of human CEP192, as a direct substrate of APC/CFZR-1. We show that loss of APC/CFZR-1 increases SPD-2 levels both in the cytoplasm and at centrosomes, and that SPD-2 physically associates with FZR-1 in vivo.

A.; Reinsch, N.", "abstract": "Background: While genomic selection (GS) boosts rapid genetic gains by leveraging dense marker data for genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs), prolonged application can reduce haplotype diversity and increase inbreeding. To address these risks, recent research has emphasized Mendelian sampling variance (MSV) and covariance (MSC), which capture within-family (co)variation not fully reflected in GEBVs. In parallel, theoretical advances have introduced a haplotype-based similarity measure that targets shared heterozygous segments, enabling more direct control over haplotype diversity, either standalone or in combination with conventional coancestry-based and genomic relationship matrices. Results: We present PyMSQ, an open-source Python package that implements two key developments: (1) a matrix-based approach for computing MSV and MSC in single-trait, multi-trait, and zygotic contexts, and (2) a haplotype-based similarity metric. By combining this matrix-based framework with optimized scientific libraries, PyMSQ achieves up to 332-fold faster computations than gamevar, a publicly available alternative, while preserving numerical accuracy. Using a Holstein-Friesian dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PyMSQ in deriving MSV and MSC, as well as its novel similarity measure, which complements standard genomic relationship matrices by explicitly quantifying shared heterozygous segments rather than overall allele sharing, thereby providing additional insights for balancing immediate gains with long-term diversity. Conclusion: By facilitating the practical use of MSV, MSC, and a haplotype-based similarity metric, PyMSQ enables breeders and quantitative geneticists to adopt haplotype diversity constraint, whether as a standalone criterion or in synergy with optimal contribution selection. This framework opens new possibilities for preserving key haplotypic segments, ultimately supporting more sustainable genomic selection strategies.

However, due to limited tissue accessibility and lack of reliable research models, molecular drivers of ovarian aging remain poorly understood. A key barrier in the field has been the limited establishment and benchmarking of preclinical models faithfully recapitulating human ovarian biology. To address this, we curated publicly available single-cell/nucleus ovarian RNA-seq datasets from human, macaque, mouse, and goat, and processed them using a consistent and stringent pipeline. Datasets were then annotated in a harmonized fashion across studies in order to conduct a robust, integrative, cross-species analysis of ovarian aging with single cell resolution. We systematically evaluated cell-type composition, global transcriptional perturbations, gene-level changes, pathway and network features, and drug-response alignments. Across analyses, granulosa and theca cells emerged as the cell-types most affected by aging. We observed limited but promising consistencies across species, including granulosa-specific signature genes (FSHR and OSGIN2) and cell type-linked pathways, with extracellular matrix/adhesion programs in granulosa and ribosomal/mitochondrial programs in theca cells. These convergences suggest that cross-species modeling likely capture core aspects of ovarian aging. Together, our meta-analysis approach may help refine model selection, generate testable hypotheses, and cautiously inform preclinical and translational work in ovarian aging.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

A.; Tian, R.; Yerka, M.; Yinping, J.", "abstract": "Background Cereal grains are a cornerstone of global food and feed security as well as a key raw material for bioenergy production. Dissecting the molecular networks and metabolic pathways that shape grain composition is critical for advancing agricultural and nutritional sciences. Sorghum Sorghum bicolor a climate-resilient C4 cereal with exceptional tolerance to heat and drought is an important model for metabolic genomics. However the genetic basis of natural variation in sorghum grain metabolites key determinants of nutritional value and end-use quality remains largely unexplored. Results Our integrative metabolomic genomic analyses and machine learning reveal extensive metabolic diversity in sorghum grain and its underlying genetic architecture. We performed large-scale untargeted metabolomic profiling of mature grains from the Sorghum Association Panel detecting 4877 metabolites with extensive variability across accessions. More than 36 percent of metabolites particularly those linked to amino acid and polyphenol biosynthesis exhibited high natural diversity underscoring sorghums potential for nutritional enhancement. Metabolite-based genome-wide association studies mGWAS identified approximately 4.15 million significant SNP metabolite associations enriched in regulatory regions thereby revealing the genetic architecture of metabolic diversity. We further identified 38 metabolite gene clusters highlighting coordinated regulation of key pathways. By integrating machine learning we uncovered major metabolites determining grain color and pinpointed associated genes demonstrating predictive frameworks for phenotype-genotype-metabolite relationships. Conclusions This study provides the first population-scale map of sorghum grain metabolomic and genetic diversity. To enable broad access and translational use we established the Sorghum Grain Metabolite Diversity Atlas SorGMDA an open database integrating metabolomic and genomic variation. Together these resources offer a foundation for comparative metabolic genomics across cereals enable systems-level dissection of metabolic regulation and support breeding of nutrient-dense climate-resilient grains to address global food and agriculture challenges.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We investigated gene regulatory variation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 165 self-reported African American adults (aged 50-89 years) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq). Self-reported psychological stress and social support were associated with differential expression of 1,956 and 1,296 genes, respectively (10% FDR), primarily in CD4+ T cells and monocytes. Interferon signaling genes showed high expression in individuals with high psychological stress and low expression in those with high social support; this pattern mirrored gene expression in individuals with elevated circulating inflammatory markers (IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, IL-6). Genome-wide transcription factor (TF) motif analysis identified stress- and social support-associated changes in motif activity for 70 and 116 TFs, respectively, with 87 motifs enriched near differentially expressed genes. In CD4+ T cells, high psychological stress corresponded to increased IRF and STAT TF motif activity (interferon pathway), while social support was associated with reduced activity and expression in these pathways. We used an immune challenge paradigm (i.e., LPS stimulation), which confirmed the biological pathways of these gene regulatory effects. Our results demonstrate that psychological stress and social support modulate immune gene regulation at the single-cell level, revealing mechanistic links between psychosocial factors and inflammation, and suggesting that social support may promote immunological health.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Understanding the behaviour and movement patterns of rewilded animals is central to evaluating the success of rewilding efforts. In this study, we compared the behaviour of rewilded Persian leopards (Panthera pardus tulliana) in Russia with their wild counterparts in Iran to assess how they compare in terms of exploratory and cautious movement in new environments. We used Behavioural Change Point Analysis with selection procedures to identify points where individuals switched between movement modes. We analysed intrinsic movement metrics (speed, persistence velocity, turning velocity) and spatiotemporal attributes (duration, net squared displacement, distance travelled). Time spent in each behavioural mode differed between wild and rewilded leopards: on average, rewilded leopards spent more time in the \"Ranging\" mode and less time \"Encamped\" compared to wild leopards. Rewilded leopards were also slower than wild leopards, particularly in the \"Encamped\" state while wild leopards exhibited similar speeds across modes. Importantly, rewilded leopards had larger displacement and spent longer in the \"Ranging\" mode, a pattern not seen in wild leopards. These findings highlight distinct spatial behaviour patterns between wild and rewilded leopards. Accordingly, rewilded leopards adopted both exploratory and cautious behavioural strategies, reflecting their tendency to range more widely over extended periods, plausibly to gather information from large parts of their environments, albeit at lower speed, arguably to avoid potential risks, suggesting that they are in the process of adapting to new environments. These differences are likely to reflect different ecological circumstances, but even more so the previous experiences and thus different social circumstances of the two samples of Persian leopards.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is a DNA repair pathway that utilizes a template-based approach to repair double-strand breaks within the genome. Template utilization requires the exchange of individual DNA strands, which members of the RecA family of recombinases facilitate. Rad51 is a primary strand exchange factor in eukaryotes. During regular mitotic DNA repair, Rad51 is aided by the DNA translocase Rad54, which acts as a motor to remodel the template DNA and stabilize primary-strand exchange intermediates. The regulation of this activity remains incompletely understood. Here, we have identified a conserved site within the C-terminal region of Rad54. The mutation of this site creates a functional separation at early strand-exchange intermediates in vivo. Using this mutant protein, we identify a novel intermediate essential for stabilizing displacement loop (D-loop) structures. This precedes the removal of Rad51 and DNA extension. Based on our experiments, we hypothesize that this Rad54 mutant cannot stabilize Rad51-mediated strand-exchange intermediates because it cannot topologically isolate dsDNA regions. Identifying a mutant that disrupts this intermediate before Rad51 removal unifies existing models of Rad54-mediated D-loop formation and extension.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluate CYP46A1 expression and the impact of its activation in the developing mouse retina under normal and pathological conditions. Materials and Methods: Seven-day-old (P7) C57BL/6J mice maintained in room air (controls) or subjected to oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) were treated with/without 20 mg/kg of the CYP46A1 activator efavirenz (EFV) from P7 to P17.

Results: EFV treatment significantly reduced pathological neovascularization and the size of avascular and hypoxic areas in OIR mice retinas. EFV treatment additionally limited reactive gliosis and microglia activation and improved retinal ganglion cell survival in OIR mice. Conclusions: The current study demonstrates the developmental regulation of CYP46A1 and the dysregulated expression and levels of the downstream metabolite 24-Hydroxycholesterol (24HC) in OIR mice.

And exploring GRNs is of great value for understanding biological functions and developing species resources. At present, studies on plant GRNs are limited, mostly focusing on the tissue level, which hinders the discovery of cell type-specific regulatory networks and mechanisms. To address this, we have proposed a GRN research framework named ctsGRN (CellTypeSpecGRN) for conducting cell-specific GRN research at the cell type resolution. In this framework, we employed three representative algorithms from statistics (e.g., correlation analysis), traditional machine learning (e.g., random forest) and deep learning (e.g., neural networks) to construct GRNs for different cell types in Arabidopsis roots. Among these, traditional machine learning methods showed the best performance. Experimental validation through yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays and ChIP-seq data confirmed the high reliability and predictive power of these inferred GRNs. By analyzing these networks, we mined novel cell type-specific regulatory relationships, identified core transcription factor (TF) AT5G08790 involved in root development, discovered 249 cell-type-specific hub TFs, and 136 key functional modules were found to be enriched in biological processes. Additionally, we revealed significant heterogeneity of TF-target gene interactions across various cell types. This comprehensive analysis offers a detailed overview of TF-mediated cell type-specific transcriptional regulation in Arabidopsis roots, providing new insights into the molecular mechanisms of root development and establishing a guideline framework for GRN research at the cell-type level in plants.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We screened over 11,000 compounds across six pancreatic cancer and two control cell lines, confirming 392 hits, and used these data to train cell line specific classifiers that outperformed fingerprint-based models. We embedded these predictors into the REINVENT platform to generate molecules with desired cytotoxicity profiles, including challenging cases of distinguishing between pancreatic cancer lines with highly similar molecular backgrounds. We generated between 37 and 137 high scoring candidates in seven different cell selectivity exercises, which were structurally distant from the active compounds in the training set. We tested 45 close analogues to the AI designed molecules, and 20 of them showed the desired cell-specific cytotoxic effects.

It is thus now possible to assemble large sized datasets encompassing the molecular variation of several species and/or populations or breeds. Nonetheless, these datasets can be extremely variable in terms of geographical provenance and sample sizes, with taxonomic groups varying from hundreds to just a few or even one single entry. In such circumstances, the application of standard filtering approaches may lead to the introduction of biases and to the under/over representation of some groups or gene pools. Commonly adopted variant filtering approaches relying on Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) and Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) may not be suitable to treat datasets representing broadscale diversity of multiple species, due to remarkable differences in LD structure and in the frequency of variants at the local vs. global scale. Thus, by exploiting the VarGoats 1000 goat genome project data as an optimal case study, we devised a novel approach based on within-population subsampling, Minor Allele Count (MAC) and marker spacing (bp-space), specifically designed to avoid biases introduced by standard filtering procedures and to adequately represent continental and species-specific variation.

Beyond its role as an iron donor, heme can influence diverse proteins and signaling pathways that drive tumor progression, but how heme regulates ferroptosis remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a paradoxical, protective function of heme in the absence of HMOX1 activity. When HMOX1 is inactive, heme becomes stabilized, leading to ferritin upregulation, suppression of ferroptosis, and rescue of cell death induced by both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of GPX4.

Autophagy is a cell survival pathway that supports tumor growth under metabolic stress and has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic avenue specifically in KRAS mutant cancers. The Unc-51-like ATG-activating kinases 1 and 2 (ULK) initiate the earliest regulated steps of autophagy and are the only protein kinases in the canonical autophagy pathway, thus making them attractive therapeutic targets for KRAS mutant tumors. We show here that genetic depletion of ULK1 or ATG13, core components of the ULK1 complex, in KRAS mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines results in growth inhibition. Previously, we developed small molecule ULK1 inhibitors that not only inhibit ULK kinase activity but also induced the degradation of other core members of the ULK complex including ATG101 and ATG13. Therefore, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay in which ATG13 was HiBiT-tagged in KRAS mutant lung cancer cells to evaluate ULK inhibitors for ATG13 degradation. Using this approach, we discovered a lead ULK inhibitor, SBP-1750, that potently inhibited ULK activity, promoted robust ATG13 degradation, impaired ATG, and induced KRAS mutant cancer cell death. Studies in a KRAS-mutant orthotopic syngeneic pancreatic cancer model show that oral treatment with SBP 1750 significantly reduced tumor growth. Pharmacokinetic analysis of SBP-1750 indicates favorable drug exposure and pharmacodynamic analysis confirms ATG13 degradation in vivo, mirroring in vitro results. Finally, immunohistochemical staining of orthotopic pancreatic tumors reveals a significant increase in CD4 and CD8 T cell infiltration upon treatment, suggesting that SBP-1750 enhances anti-tumor immunity.

Mechanistically, STAT5-driven upregulation of the IRG1/itaconate axis in TAMs rewires mitochondrial metabolism and activates NRF2-dependent GSH biosynthesis. GSH is subsequently released into the tumor microenvironment, where it is taken up by tumor cells, protecting them from PARPi-induced cytotoxicity and dampening immune responses. Pharmacological inhibition of IRG1 reverses these effects, restoring PARPi sensitivity and enhancing anti-tumor immunity in BRCA1-deficient tumor models.

We showcase, with real-world examples, how the side effects predicted by this model can be interpreted and traced back to off-target proteins, and the complexes and signaling pathways in which they partake. In this way, the proposed model not only provides actionable insights, but in the future, may contribute to the amendment of secondary pharmacology assays.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Subcutaneous administration of the adipomyokine Follistatin-like-1 (recombinant non-glycosylated human FSTL1, ngFSTL1) for two weeks, beginning one month following myocardial infarction, decreased infarct necrosis, increased blood flow, and increased cardiomyocyte proliferation within the infarct region, leading to improved systolic and diastolic function. ngFSTL-1 also enhanced coronary and peripheral vascular function by increasing BKCa channel-dependent vasodilatory capacity.

EndMT has recently been implicated in the development and progression of pulmonary vascular remodeling in pulmonary hypertension (PH); however, its underlying regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators of EC gene expression and cellular responses to various stimuli. Notably, microRNA-153 (miR-153) has been shown to directly target SNAI1 to modulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process closely related to EndMT and extensively studied in cancer. Whether miR-153 also participates in EndMT regulation, however, remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that 72-hour hypoxic exposure induces SNAI1-mediated EndMT in human lung vascular ECs. Hypoxia also increased cell proliferation and disrupted intercellular junctions, leading to enhanced endothelial permeability. Reduced miR-153 expression was observed in both hypoxia- and TGF-{beta}1-induced EndMT, as well as in ECs isolated from PH patients exhibiting an EndMT phenotype. Similar to hypoxia, TGF-{beta}1 promoted EC permeability. Loss of miR-153 enhanced SNAI1-mediated EndMT, endothelial survival, and permeability under normoxic conditions, whereas miR-153 overexpression attenuated EndMT induced by hypoxia or TGF-{beta}1. However, miR-153 restoration did not completely recover endothelial barrier integrity disrupted by these stimuli. In conclusion, miR-153 serves as a critical regulator of EndMT, maintaining endothelial identity and barrier function. Therapeutic delivery of miR-153 may therefore represent a novel strategy to inhibit EndMT and attenuate pulmonary vascular remodeling in PH.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

E.; Panwar, A.; Agarwal, P.", "abstract": "Rice seed storage proteins (SSPs) serve as the primary source of dietary protein, energy, and nutrition; however, our understanding of these proteins remains limited, hindering efforts aimed at enhancing grain nutritional quality. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of rice SSPs, encompassing phylogenetic relationships, domain and motif characterization, promoter cis-element mapping, expression profiling, and 3D structural modeling. Through homology- and domain-based searches, we identified 65 SSP-encoding genes, including 19 previously uncharacterized members. Phylogenetic analysis and domain comparisons revealed evolutionary proximity between albumins and prolamins; and between globulins and glutelins. Albumins, glutelins and prolamins clustered tandemly implying that duplication has driven SSP expansion. Transcriptomic evidence indicated that albumins, globulins, and glutelins were transcriptionally active from S2 seed development stage, whereas prolamins initiated expression from S3 stage. Promoter analysis revealed several seed-specific cis-regulatory elements, with CAATBOX1, EBOXBNNAPA, and DOFCOREZM being the most prevalent. Structural modeling showed that albumins and prolamins predominantly adopted -helical conformations, whereas globulins and glutelins were enriched in {beta}-strands and coils. This integrated analysis offers valuable insights into the classification, evolution, regulation, and structure of rice SSPs, providing a foundational resource for advancing grain nutritional improvement strategies.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We investigated short-term and transannual memory of water deficit in cambium derived tissues of poplars (Populus spp.) using two contrasting genotypes and four genetically modified epitypes with altered DNA methylation machinery. We found persistent changes in hormone profiles, gene expression and DNA methylation one week after stress relief, consistent with a molecular short-term stress memory. These signatures revealed distinct adaptive strategies between genotypes and marked variability between epitypes, demonstrating that both genetic and epigenetic backgrounds drive stress memory. Trees already exposed to water deficit in Year 1 showed distinct physiological and molecular responses when subjected to a second water deficit in Year 2, supporting the persistence of a long-term trans-annual memory possibly involved in tree priming. The higher molecular plasticity observed in the intrinsically more sensitive genotype contrasted with the higher stability observed in the intrinsically more tolerant genotype. The number of memory genes was limited, but the results suggested that stable drought-induced DNA methylation changes, particularly in the CG context, contribute to long-term stress imprinting. Our findings highlight the cambium as a reservoir for stress memory in trees and suggest that DNA methylation dynamics shaped by genetic predisposition, acting through cis- and trans-regulatory routes, may help fine-tuning growth vs. survival strategies across longer time frames. These insights open perspectives for harnessing epigenetic variation in tree breeding and management under increasing drought frequency.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

PAW contains nitrate (NO3-) and reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which are fixed from atmospheric molecules via NTP. While early studies report positive effects of PAW on plant growth, its influence on plant-associated microbial communities remains poorly understood. Here, we compared the impacts of PAW or NO3- solutions on the rhizosphere microbial community of Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum. PAW was generated by a radio frequency (RF) glow discharge plasma source and contained no measurable ROS, while the control solution contained an equivalent concentration of NO3-. No significant differences in alpha diversity were detected in either plant species microbiome after 5 weeks of treatment when grown in non-commercial potting substrate. Significant dissimilarity was found in terms of beta diversity, but the relative abundance of the sequenced genera suggested no functional differences in rhizosphere communities. Overall, PAW treatment did not adversely impact the rhizosphere microbiome in either Arabidopsis or tomato.

The insulin signaling pathway's contribution to insulin resistance remains incompletely understood. Insulin receptor (IR) mutations can cause insulin resistance; however, reduced IR expression in obesity may still permit sufficient signaling due to the characteristics of IR, known as the spare receptor hypothesis. Selective insulin resistance, in which glucose metabolism is impaired while other pathways remain intact, further complicates insulin resistance. To elucidate these mechanisms, we developed mathematical models of the insulin signaling pathway in mice with diet-induced obesity and found that changes in protein expression levels can largely account for signal attenuation. Insulin resistance was characterized using two indices: sensitivity shift and responsiveness shift. We found a trade-off between the two, whereby loss of responsiveness from upstream decreases was compensated for by decreases in downstream sensitivity. The excess of receptors conferred robustness to receptor decreases via the signaling pathway. Incoherent-feedforward-loop regulation maintained some signaling despite attenuation, potentially explaining selective insulin resistance. These findings provide deeper insights into insulin resistance and quantitative mechanisms underlying signaling pathway regulation.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

The South American land planarian Obama nungara has become a widespread invasive soil-dwelling predator in Europe, preying mainly on earthworms and potentially disrupting soil processes.

This study tested the hypothesis that a 15-minute 40 {degrees}C water bath is lethal to O. nungara egg capsules. Thirteen egg capsules were collected from six adult individuals. Every second capsule was subjected to heat treatment, while the remaining served as controls. None of the six heat-treated capsules hatched, whereas five of the seven untreated egg capsules hatched, each produced between five and seven hatchlings after approximately 24 days. These results demonstrate that the recommended heated water bath is effective not only against adults but also against O. nungara egg capsules.

The fruit fly is an ideal model for a comprehensive analysis of feature detection mechanisms given its complete synaptic wiring diagrams, robust behavioral assays, and cell-type-specific gene expression datasets. We previously showed that columnar visual neurons T3 are required for saccadic orientation toward landscape features during flight. Here, we examine how signals downstream of T3 are processed in the central brain. We identify the LC17 type of visual projection neurons as key postsynaptic targets: they receive strong excitatory input from T3, project to premotor brain regions, and are thus positioned to support visual approach. Using in vivo optical physiology and virtual reality behavior, we demonstrate that LC17 neurons are indeed necessary for object tracking during flight. Furthermore, we find that electrical synapses in LC17 are also required for tracking behavior. Accordingly, we show that the innexin Shaking B (shakB) is highly expressed in LC17 dendrites, and genetic perturbations confirm an essential role for gap junctional coupling in this circuit. Our findings reveal mechanisms underlying visual approach, and highlight the interplay between electrical and chemical neurotransmission for rapid object detection and action selection.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Thus, there is a need to identify the molecular features of invasive GBM cells and their regulators in the neural microenvironment. To address this in a fully human model, we engrafted patient-derived GBM cells (total n=15 independent samples) from three sources - fresh neurosurgical resections, cell lines, and whole GBM organoids - into human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids patterned to forebrain, midbrain, and spinal cord identities. GBM cells from all sources infiltrated brain organoids within 2 days post-engraftment, reaching maximal invasion by day 14. Across organoids of distinct spatial and maturational milieu, GBM cells showed a consistent reduction in astrocyte-like states and an enrichment in neuron/glia progenitor-like (NPC-like) states. These NPC-like GBM cells expressed neuronal and synaptic machinery, and tumors enriched in this transcriptomic state prior to engraftment achieved greater organoid coverage, suggesting enhanced infiltration and synaptic integration of this GBM cell type. Although GBM cell states converged across organoid types after engraftment, infiltration was greater in the forebrain than spinal cord. This is likely reflective of synaptic input from deep-layer TBR1 excitatory neurons in the forebrain, as demonstrated by a combination of rabies-based monosynaptic tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. In contrast, inhibitory neurons were the predominant synaptic partners of GBM in the spinal cord. Together, this fully human model of the neural-GBM connectome reveals how neuron-like GBM states and regionally distinct synaptic inputs cooperatively shape tumor invasion.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Neuronal ensembles within the NAcore, defined here as selectively co-activated neurons during specific behavioral experiences, are essential during cocaine sensitization and recall. While transient synaptic plasticity (t-SP) has been widely observed in general neuronal populations within the NAcore during reinstatement, its ensemble-specific dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used c-Fos-TRAP2-based tagging to identify cocaine-seeking ensembles in mice following cocaine intravenous self-administration, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement. Structural spine plasticity was assessed via confocal microscopy, and functional changes were measured using whole-cell electrophysiology across multiple reinstatement time points. Ensemble neurons exhibited enhanced dendritic spine head diameter (dh) and AMPA/NMDA (A/N) ratios following cue exposure, consistent with t-SP. Notably, spine classification revealed a reduction in mature spines during reinstatement, suggesting morphological remodeling rather than new spine formation in both ensemble and non-ensemble cells. Non-ensemble neurons exhibited classical functional transient synaptic plasticity, characterized by increased A/N ratios but no significant changes in dh. To begin assessing if presynaptic vesicle release impacts t-SP, paired-pulse ratio analysis indicated no differences in population or time point. Importantly, ensemble neurons displayed elevated A/N ratio following cocaine exposure, suggesting prior silent synapse maturation. These findings demonstrate that t-SP is not uniformly distributed across NAcore neurons but differs significantly between ensemble and non-ensemble neurons.

Given the anti-inflammatory and metabolically favorable actions of peroxisome-proliferator activated nuclear receptor (PPAR) agonists, we investigated whether PPAR agonism could enhance the therapeutic efficacy and/or mitigate the (metabolic) side effects of glucocorticoids. Methods: We evaluated the effects of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the PPAR agonist GW7647 (GW) across three RA model systems: L929sA fibroblasts, primary human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. Results: Dexamethasone reduced the inflammatory TNF response in L929sA cells, which was further potentiated by GW. In vivo however, GW reduced the dexamethasone-induced adiposity and hypertriglyceridemia, but not arthritis severity. Curiously, GW alone induced several proinflammatory genes within arthritic synovium which were counteracted by glucocorticoids. Proteomic profiling of TNF-stimulated human FLS revealed that combined use of dexamethasone and GW selectively suppressed interferon-stimulated proteins. In line herewith, co-stimulation with TNF and IFN&{beta} amplified the suppressive effect of combined dexamethasone and GW treatment on pro-inflammatory gene expression in L929sA versus TNF alone. Conclusion: GW enhances the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids in human FLS and L929sA, and mitigates metabolic side effects of dexamethasone in vivo, without compromising their efficacy. In addition, PPAR agonism permits to broaden its anti-inflammatory profile to interferon driven pathways.

While its pulmonary effects are well established, the mechanisms linking lung inflammation to vascular injury remain unclear. Because neutrophils are early responders to CS-induced inflammation, we hypothesized that they drive systemic myelopoiesis and vascular inflammation via alarmin release. Methods: Wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to inhaled CS or orally administered cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Immune cell composition in lung, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), blood, spleen, and bone marrow (BM) was assessed by flow cytometry. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and S100A8/A9 release were quantified. Atherosclerosis progression was evaluated in Ldlr-/- mice fed a Western diet and treated with CSE. To define the role of neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9, bone marrow transplantation was performed using S100a9?/? or WT donors. Results: CS exposure increased circulating monocytes and neutrophils through enhanced BM myelopoiesis and elevated ROS-dependent S100A8/A9 release. Oral CSE reproduced these effects, indicating direct activation of neutrophils independent of pulmonary inflammation or lipid changes. In Ldlr-/- mice, CSE accelerated atherosclerosis by promoting infiltration of inflammasome-primed neutrophils, increased IL-1? release, and impaired macrophage efferocytosis. Hematopoietic S100a9 deletion normalized myelopoiesis and reduced vascular inflammation and plaque burden.

Aspergillus calidoustus demonstrated remarkable survival under simulated Martian conditions, withstanding up to 1440 minutes of Martian solar irradiation, Mars atmospheric pressure and composition, and the presence of Martian regolith. Lethality only occurred under combined irradiation and cooling to -60{degrees}C (the mean Mars surface temperature), emphasising the synergistic effect of these conditions.

Using synthetic hydrogels of tunable stiffness that restrict physical expansion without limiting nutrient access, we demonstrate that growth in elastic materials reduces P. aeruginosa sensitivity to multiple clinically relevant antibiotics in a stiffness-dependent manner. Although slower growth contributes to this decreased susceptibility, Tn-seq under antibiotic treatment identified key regulators of mechanically induced tolerance.

Aboveground, increasing the connectivity of regenerating forests fragments facilitates the recolonization of tropical forest biodiversity. However, restoring functional ecosystems also requires the recovery of decomposition processes as these are essential in shaping aboveground biodiversity. Therefore, we investigate the role of forest connectivity on restoring the composition and functioning of fungal communities in the leaf litter layer during a chronosequence of forest restoration. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we studied secondary forests regrown between 18 to 55 years after deforestation and different levels of forest connectivity and compared their litter to recently abandoned pastures and undisturbed primary forests. We quantified how forest age and connectivity between fragments influenced the litter fungi composition in relation to tree diversity, litter chemistry, and litter isotopes. We show that fungal composition was highly heterogeneous in forest litter, whereas pasture litter exhibited a more homogeneous community. Moreover, forest connectivity had stronger effects on litter fungal composition compared to forest age. Connectivity promoted wood saprotrophs and endophytes, while suppressed soil saprotrophs, with its effects being more evident during later stages of restoration. Fungal guilds such as endophytes and saprophytes, were primarily influenced by tree diversity and leaf litter chemistry. We conclude that forest connectivity promotes the re-establishment of saprophytic fungi capable of decomposing recalcitrant litter substrates, driven mainly by enhancing tree diversity and litter quality. Practical implications of increasing connectivity may relate to forest resilience on front of future climate change scenarios.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Like the orthologous human P400 complex, DOM-A combines two epigenetic effectors: a SWR1-type histone exchange enzyme, Dom-A, and the Tip60 acetyltransferase. We found Xbp1, a conserved transcription regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), as tightly associated with immunopurified DOM-A and explored the functional implications of this interaction. We biochemically determined the Xbp1 DNA recognition motif in chromatin-reconstituted Drosophila genomes. Intersection of the chromatin binding profiles for Xbp1 and Dom-A in proliferating cells and reciprocal protein depletion studies revealed two distinct modes through which Xbp1 binds chromatin. Xbp1 recruits Dom-A to motif-bearing promoters of genes involved in the UPR, such as Xbp1, Hsc70-3 and Gp93, and activates their transcription. Xbp1 also localizes to hundreds of high-confidence Dom-A binding sites that lack Xbp1 recognition motifs. These interactions depend on Dom-A, pointing to a \"reverse targeting\" scenario. Upon depletion of Dom-A, Xbp1 protein levels, but not mRNA levels, are reduced. The Xbp1 may thus be stabilized upon binding to DOM-A. The complex interactions of Xbp1 and DOM-A in the genome bear potential to integrate signals from the UPR with the general, DOM-mediated regulation of cell growth and proliferation.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

This inference is further supported by the identification of sequential and functional ALG1 homologs exclusively within bacterial lineages, rather than in Asgard archaea or other archaeal groups. Our findings challenge the prevailing hypothesis that the eukaryotic N-glycosylation pathway primarily evolved from archaeal ancestors, instead suggesting a chimeric origin involving contributions from both bacterial and archaeal lineages.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Systemic inflammation and leukocyte activation are early events in diabetes, while microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and retinal neurodegeneration are early events in DR. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) plays a complex role in monocyte / macrophage activation which may impact DR. We therefore investigated the role of myeloid cell-specific PTP1B using LysMcre-PTP1B fl/fl (LysM-PTP1B) mice, as well as a PTP1B inhibitor, MSI-1436, in the early stages of DR. Mice were rendered diabetic for six weeks using anomer-equilibrated streptozotocin (STZ). Retinal changes were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry, and systemic leukocyte activation by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial function in high glucose-challenged, cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from LysM-PTP1B and MSI-I436-treated mice was determined in vitro. Both myeloid cell-specific depletion and pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B prevent STZ-induced retinal neurodegeneration, development of acellular retinal capillaries, as well as microglial and systemic leukocyte activation without effect on development of diabetes. In vitro, inhibition of PTP1B prevented high glucose-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in BMDMs. We conclude that inhibition of PTP1B prevents DR by decreasing myeloid cell-driven inflammation and PTP1B represents a therapeutic target for prevention DR.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

H-NS is a well-studied NAP that acts as a global gene silencer capable of bridging and looping DNA in vitro. Here, using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture assays, we show that H-NS mediates genome-wide long-range DNA looping in the stationary-phase nucleoid of Escherichia coli. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that high levels of H-NS are present at the base of DNA loops. Super-resolution imaging and single-particle tracking show that H-NS binds more tightly in stationary phase and compacts the nucleoid mesh. Transcriptomic analyses indicate H-NS represses gene expression more strongly in the looped nucleoid and enables higher expression of genes outside of H-NS-bound regions. Overall, our study demonstrates that H-NS bridges distal DNA regions along the genome upon nutrient limitation, causing reduced nucleoid accessibility, stronger transcriptional repression, and a shifted transcriptional landscape.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Ablating endothelial Perk boosted Notch ligand DLL4 expression and promoted DLL4-dependent early HSC and B progenitor regeneration.

We report an essential pathway that clears many maternal transcripts from early C. elegans embryos using the Rbfox-related SPN-4 RNA-binding protein as a specificity factor and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex as an effector. We biochemically identified SPN-4-associated mRNAs from late-stage oocytes and found that the set of SPN-4-associated transcripts is enriched for maternal mRNAs that undergo early decay. Single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments established that many SPN-4-associated mRNAs fail to be eliminated in the absence of SPN-4. In the 3'UTRs of two target mRNAs, we identified Rbfox motifs that are required for SPN-4-dependent clearance in vivo and bind SPN-4 in vitro. In a genetic screen to identify factors that work with SPN-4, we isolated mutant alleles of CCR4-NOT components. Auxin-induced degradation of the LET-711/NOT1 scaffold and the CCF-1 deadenylase disrupted clearance of two SPN-4-associated transcripts.

In this study, we quantified the interannual variations in scallop growth rate and thermal stress intensity in the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that the scallop growth rate variations were overall synchronized between the shallow (< 60 m) and deep ([&ge;] 60 m) MAB prior to 2015. The response of growth rate to warming in 2015 and 2016 showed marked spatial heterogeneity: scallops in the shallow subregions grew more slowly in the warm years, whereas higher temperature contributed to elevated growth rates in the deep subregions. We developed a dynamic energy budget model to explain the distinct growth rate response to warming at different depths. The model results showed that, in 2016, bottom temperatures in the shallow subregions exceeded the optimal range, limiting the energy available for growth. In contrast, warming created more favorable thermal conditions in the deep habitats.

Phytoplankton metabolism is both affected by, and influences the region's nutrient cycling, primary production, and ultimately, the fate of carbon export. Thus, developing an understanding of these processes is critical. Phytoplankton biomass, biological rates, and gene expression data along with associated environmental parameters were measured as part of the NASA EXport Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing program's campaign to the North Atlantic to evaluate the relationships amongst these processes within the four most dominant phytoplankton groups (diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes, and chlorophytes) during the spring bloom. We observe a transition from a period dominated by active diatom growth (defined as Phase I) to a period dominated by non-diatom phytoplankton groups (Phase II). Silicic acid depletion appears to limit overall production and reduce competition from diatoms, likely leading to enhanced contributions of haptophytes in Phase II. Expression of key protein-encoding genes involved in cell maintenance, photosynthesis, and nitrogen and vitamin metabolisms varied amongst the taxa throughout the observation period. Expression patterns of diatom genes involved in silicon transport suggest an apparent uncoupling between genes involved in nitrate uptake and photosynthesis, resulting in an increase in silicification independent growth. Our analysis demonstrates the utility in combining gene expression with biological rate processes to provide a more holistic view of phytoplankton bloom dynamics and phenology.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, larvae develop in ephemeral breeding substrates such as decaying fruits, where they acquire maternally transmitted bacterial and fungal symbionts. These substrates vary in their structural and chemical properties, potentially altering the composition and function of associated microbial communities. Here, we combine semi-natural microcosm experiments with compound-specific isotope analysis of essential amino acids to assess how variation in fruit substrate and symbiont origin affect larval nutrition, development, and adult phenotypes. We find that microbial community composition and environmental context jointly shape amino acid flow, with larvae deriving variable proportions of their nutrition from plant, bacterial, and fungal sources. These differences translate into distinct developmental outcomes, including shifts in larval development time - either delayed or accelerated, depending on the symbiont-substrate combination - and significant variation in adult body weight. Our findings introduce symbiont-environment interactions as a framework for understanding how ecological context shapes nutritional mutualisms, showing that environmental heterogeneity can alter microbial composition, nutrient sources, and larval performance. Together, these results reveal how ecological context modulates mutualistic dependence and underscores the context sensitivity of host-microbe associations.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

In birds, it is widely proposed that vocal complexity evolves as an honest signal of individual quality driven by sexual selection. Other hypotheses related to social interactions include competition for ecological resources (social selection) and intra-group communication in group-living animals, both of which may favour signal complexity. However, these hypotheses are rarely explored at macroevolutionary scales, particularly in the context of constraints on sound production, transmission and detection, leading to ongoing uncertainty about the evolutionary origins of complex vocal signals. Using Bayesian phylogenetic models, we test whether different forms of social communication and ecological constraints predict the temporal and spectral complexity of songs in 1,288 species of suboscine passerine birds. We found that song complexity was reduced by sexual selection, along with other limiting factors including large body size and dense vegetation. Conversely, territoriality boosted the temporal complexity of songs. These findings challenge the common assumption that sexual selection is the main driver of increased signal complexity, and instead highlight the role of social selection as a key component of multiple inter-related drivers and constraints.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Males of D. santomea, a West African island endemic, distinguish conspecific sexes but court males and females promiscuously and seldom attack. Elevated intermale courtship derives from at least three changes in two separate pheromone systems. In males, the sexually monomorphic cuticular pheromone 7-tricosene promotes rather than inhibits courtship and the courtship-inhibiting olfactory pheromone cVA is reduced 84-92% compared to close relatives, including the sibling species D. yakuba. The third change is surprisingly in D. santomea females, where cVA suppresses rather than promotes sexual receptivity. The female cVA switch and male cVA reduction may have co-evolved to maintain efficient intraspecific mating in D. santomea but prevent sympatric hybridization with D. yakuba, or to reduce intraspecific aggression. We find that high intermale courtship and low cVA also co-occur and appear selectively derived in a distant monomorphic species D. persimilis, implying pheromonal and behavioral convergence in the two recently speciated taxa.

Procainamide is a well-known fluorophore used for released N-glycans reducing sugar aldehydes labeling that offers both high fluorescence and mass spectrometry detection sensitivity comparable to several commercial reagents available in the market. However, currently there are no studies that optimize its use and long incubation times are often reported in the literature for procainamide labeling of N-glycans that has limited its use in time-sensitive workflows relevant to various stakeholders in industry, academia, and regulatory agencies. Here, we have systematically determined the combined procainamide labeling via reductive amination/reduction reaction kinetics at various incubation intervals, ranging from 1 min to 12 h, using N-glycans isolated from model biologic glycoprotein trastuzumab (TmAb). Labeling efficiencies were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLR), and detailed reaction parameters were determined by fitting suitable kinetic models. Results indicate that most N-glycans reached over 95% labeling efficiency within 1 hour at the desired reaction temperature. Interestingly, N-glycan structural features, particularly galactosylation and fucosylation levels, significantly influenced the labeling reaction rate. Fucosylated glycans exhibited up to 4-fold higher reaction rate constants than non-fucosylated forms, whereas increased galactosylation levels was associated with slower reaction rate.

By generating and characterizing multiple variants, we identified a triple-deletion mutant with altered loop dynamics. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that this variant explores distinct loop conformations and exhibits a subtle shift in substrate preference toward more acidic motifs. These fine-tuned conformational changes translated into specific cellular signaling outcomes, as demonstrated by phosphoproteomic profiling. Comparative analysis across species further showed that nature exploits similar loop remodeling strategies to modulate kinase function. Together, our findings provide a blueprint for rationally tuning kinase activity and offer a generalizable framework for rewiring signaling pathways in diverse cellular contexts.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Hydrogels offer tunable protein release but are limited by weak mechanics and poor stability during storage and handling. Here, we introduce a two-part protein delivery platform that integrates mechanical reinforcement with affinity-controlled protein release. We developed a melt electrowritten (MEW) scaffold-reinforced, affibody-conjugated polyethylene glycol maleimide (PEG-mal) hydrogel for affinity-controlled BMP-2 delivery. MEW scaffolds improved hydrogel handling, compressive resistance, and stability during lyophilization and rehydration, without altering bulk stiffness. Engineered BMP-2-specific affibodies provided affinity-based control over BMP-2 release. This ability to control BMP-2 release was preserved after lyophilization and rehydration of the hydrogels. In vivo, conjugation of high-affinity affibodies to the hydrogels significantly enhanced BMP-2 retention in subcutaneous implants, while MEW reinforcement significantly increased bone volume and defect bridging in rat femoral bone defects. Histology revealed more organized lamellar bone with reinforced constructs. This affibody-conjugated, MEW scaffold-reinforced hydrogel system effectively integrates mechanical reinforcement with tunable protein-material affinity interactions, advancing hydrogel-based delivery strategies for BMP-2 and other protein therapeutics in musculoskeletal repair.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

However, repeated scans can expose samples to high radiation doses, potentially altering tissue properties. This study evaluated the feasibility of low-dose synchrotron computed tomography (sCT) for high-resolution, in situ imaging of intact bovine intervertebral discs (IVDs), and assessed the effects of repeated X-ray exposure on mechanical, microstructural, and molecular integrity. Intact oxtail IVD segments were imaged using propagation-based phase contrast sCT at 54 keV. Scan parameters were optimised to achieve high image quality within 66 seconds per scan, resulting in a total dose of ~30 kGy over six scans. Mechanical properties were assessed under cyclic loading, microstructural changes via digital volume correlation (DVC), and molecular alterations using Raman spectroscopy. High-resolution imaging of soft and calcified tissues was achieved. Changes in sample stiffness, hysteresis, or stress recovery between irradiated and control were not identified. DVC revealed no microstructural damage or strain accumulation in the calcified endplate. Raman spectroscopy indicated minimal changes in soft tissues, with bone showing slight increased collagen crosslinking and reduced mineralisation. Overall, this study demonstrates that high-energy, low-dose sCT enables repeated imaging of musculoskeletal tissues without compromising integrity, supporting its application in dynamic, time-lapse imaging studies. Importantly, larger, intact samples - such as whole bovine IVDs - were imaged overcoming limitations of previous studies that relied on small animal models. This approach supports more physiologically relevant investigations of tissue mechanics and degeneration in complex systems.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Mucins separate host tissues from microbial pathogens and are instrumental for host gut health. Here, we provide evidence that mucin degradation in the gut can be mediated by mucinolysomes, defined as extracellular multi-enzyme complexes specializing in mucin degradation. We computationally predict the presence of mucinolysomes across 63 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and two isolated genomes of anaerobic Limousia bacteria, including seven MAGs from human samples of six countries. All 65 genomes were found to display core mucinolysome components, consisting of 3~6 scaffoldins (containing up to 12 cohesin modules) and up to 22 dockerin-containing mucin-degrading CAZymes (carbohydrate active enzymes). The organization of mucinolysomes allows the assembly of up to 24 CAZymes in the same complex. We validated that a cultivated Limousia strain ET540 from chicken cecum can support growth on mucins as its sole carbon source, triggering the expression of most mucinolysome-related genes, including both scaffoldins and CAZymes. We also confirmed their assembly into a multi-enzyme complex by validating the cohesin-dockerin interactions among most of the mucinolysome proteins, using AlphaFold3. While mucinolysome-encoding Limousia have low abundance in different animal hosts, their abundance and prevalence are higher in farm animals than in humans, highlighting their important role in livestock gut ecosystems. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of mucin degradation and provide a framework to explore microbial contributions to gut health and host-microbe interactions across species.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Actin cytoskeletons of individual cells exhibit intrinsic chirality, and a strong correlation exists between single-cell actin fibres chiral organisation and the collective alignment of cells confined to rectangular adhesive islands (2D-microtissues). Here, we demonstrate how multicellular chiral patterns can be inferred from the chiral behaviour of actin fibres in individual cells. By analysing chiral actin systems in cells with elliptical and semicircular shapes, representing inner and boundary positions within 2D microtissues, we defined the rules of chiral motile behaviour and formulated two models of cell alignment: (i) chiral rotation of inner cells and (ii) chiral tilting of boundary cells relative to island edges. In both models, neighbouring cells are also mutually aligned. Systematic variation of island area and aspect ratio, combined with dynamic observations, revealed the primary role of boundary cells. Chiral order first emerged at tissue boundaries and then propagated inward. This outside-in mechanism also explains why mirror-symmetric cell groups are difficult to achieve with uniformly chiral cells, but can be obtained either by reversing chirality in one subgroup or by enlarging the microtissue to minimise boundary influence.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

EstS1, a pH-tolerant, thermostable esterase, has been previously recognized for its degradation potential against phthalate diester plasticizers. The present study elucidates the exceptional potential of this enzyme to degrade crystalline PET plastic and its primary intermediate, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), into terephthalate. Kinetic analyses revealed that EstS1 degrades 75% of BHET in 1h, liberating mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and terephthalate as end products. The co-crystal structure of wild-type EstS1 with BHET exhibited the electron density of BHET, MHET, and ethylene glycol, including MHET bound at the active site, in a canonical tetrahedral intermediate conformation. The complex structure of BHET with the Ser154Ala mutant of EstS1 further accommodated two BHET molecules, one interacting directly with the catalytic triad and the oxyanion hole. MD simulation analysis revealed highly stable interactions of BHET at the active site of EstS1. Moreover, SEM imaging displayed significant degradation of the crystalline PET plastic film by EstS1 esterase over a period of 15 days, both under controlled and soil-based fluctuating environmental conditions, highlighting its versatility to varying environmental conditions. XPS analysis discovered the increase in -C-O-, -C-N-, -N-H-, and -N=O- bonds at the surface of EstS1-treated PET film, indicating effective degradation. Consequently, this comprehensive kinetic, structural, and morphology-based analysis of the PET-degrading potential of EstS1 esterase encourages further enzyme engineering studies to exploit the dual potential of EstS1 esterase to degrade both plastic and plasticizers.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Restoring the p53 activity proved to lead to tumor regression even in advanced tumors in mouse models - and thus, is among the most attractive potential strategies for novel cancer therapy. Full-length p53 (fl-p53) consists of 393 residues and multiple domains; some folded and some disordered. Using crystal structures of folded domains and integrative molecular modelling techniques for disordered domains, we generated the first wild-type fl-p53 tetramer model bound to DNA. When solvated, the system size nears 500K atoms challenging extensive sampling. Using Anton2 supercomputer for microsecond-timescale simulations in explicit solvent and the rigorous Markov state model (MSM) framework, we elucidated the conformational landscape of wild-type p53 as well as two of the p53 hot-spot cancer mutants, Y220C and G245S, in a physiological DNA-bound, full-length tetramer context. In the simulated timescale, DNA-bound fl-p53 tetramer bent DNA and formed a compact complex with interactions between the N-terminal and DNA-binding domains (DBDs), and the C-terminal domains (CTDs) with DNA. WT fl-p53 tetramer also sampled a unique quaternary DBD organization not accessed by the cancer mutants. Free energy landscapes indicated differential dynamics for inner and outer p53 DBDs due to the dimer-dimer interface. The dynamics of the druggable L1/S3 pocket is also closely monitored.

A.; Kallupi, M.; de Guglielmo, G.", "abstract": "Although FDA-approved medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) are available, their efficacy varies across patients, highlighting the need for novel therapeutics that address inter-individual differences in disease etiology and treatment response. Genetic models, particularly heterogeneous stock (HS) rats, recapitulate human-like genetic diversity and behavioral heterogeneity, enabling the dissection of individual differences in vulnerability to AUD and pharmacotherapeutic sensitivity. P2X4 receptors, which are encoded by the gene P2rx4, are ATP-gated ion channels inhibited by ethanol and abundantly expressed in neurons found in reward and stress circuits. P2X4 receptors have emerged as key modulators of ethanol sensitivity and consumption in preclinical models. Here, we genetically predicted P2rx4 expression in whole brain in a cohort of 130 HS rats exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor and phenotyped for self-administration during acute abstinence. Rats were dichotomized into high- and low-predicted expression groups. Higher predicted P2rx4 expression was associated with increased post-vapor intake and escalation. In 32 CIE-escalated rats, ivermectin, a positive allosteric modulator of P2X4 receptors, dose-dependently reduced drinking. We stratified rats into three groups: non-responders, mild responders, and high responders. Electrophysiological recordings from CeA slices revealed that ivermectin differentially enhanced GABAergic IPSCs: high-responders exhibited sustained increases in IPSC frequency and selective amplitude reductions, while the two other groups showed transient frequency increases. All groups displayed prolonged rise times, however non-responders showed extended decay times. These findings suggest that P2rx4 upregulation serves as a vulnerability marker for dependence-like behaviors, with ivermectin attenuating withdrawal-driven alcohol consumption by enhancing CeA GABAergic inhibition.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we performed year-long transcriptome analysis of A. thaliana (Col-0 and FRISf2) under annual environments simulated by growth chambers. Comparing gene expressions in FRISf2 and A. helleri, most genes had similar annual expression pattens.

These multivariate approaches have proven important for both cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces. MVPA might benefit from magnetoencephalography (MEG) systems based on optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), as these sensors can be placed closer to the scalp, providing higher spatial resolution compared to conventional MEG systems that rely on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). As OPM-based MEG systems become available at more institutions, it is essential to experimentally compare their performance with traditional SQUID-based systems using MVPA. Methods: We adapted a visual object-word paradigm from a previous study, originally implemented on a TRIUX MEGIN SQUID system, to the FieldLine HEDscan OPM system. Participants were recruited and we recorded their ingoing brain activity while did the same task in both systems. Visual stimuli of different objects were presented alternately in two modalities: pictures and the corresponding written words. For each modality, MVPA was used to classify the objects from OPM and SQUID magnetometers data respectively. To further investigate the advantages of OPM, we evaluated the effect classification accuracy of two spatial factors by controlling the number of sensors included and the spatial frequency content of the sensor data. Results: We found higher time-resolved decoding accuracy for the OPM compared to the SQUID data. Moreover, OPMs show higher classification performance compared to SQUIDs when controlling for the same number of sensors; consistently, the OPM system required fewer sensors to reach the performance limit of the SQUID system. Our analysis considering the spatial frequency content of the signal revealed that decoding accuracy plateaued for the SQUID system at lower spatial frequencies while the performance of the OPM system continued to improve when higher-order spatial components were included. Conclusion: Our OPM-MEG system outperformed the SQUID-MEG system on MVPA on decoding of visual processing. This advantage of OPM is driven by its higher spatial resolution, resulting from the sensors being positioned closer to the head and thus able to capture higher spatial frequency components of the brain signal. OPM may facilitate cognitive neuroscience research as well as brain-computer interfaces by providing higher sensitivity when employing paradigms using multi-variate data analysis.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary life-threatening disease marked by progressive neuronal loss and atrophy of grey matter structures, particularly the caudate putamen. Brain imaging studies have revealed that the degradation of the white matter occurs many years prior to symptomatic onset and neuronal loss, suggesting that the decay of brain white matter is an active contributor to the disease progression. However, the mechanisms by which the HD mutation triggers white matter loss is not well understood. Methods. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy were conducted to assess white matter pathology and explore the relevant mechanisms in CAG140 knock-in mice, which express the HD protein in the same way as patients suffering from HD and thus biologically replicate HD in human. Results. Western blot analysis of proteins localized at different layers of the myelin coat revealed that the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which is localized at the innermost layer of the myelin coat and essential for maintaining the periaxonal space and the integrity of the myelin sheath, manifested as an early and progressive decline in HD mouse caudate putamen. The loss of MAG was detected at myelinated axons and in fiber bundles in HD mouse brains at an age when the abundance of myelinated axons was normal. Fluorescence immunohistochemical studies found that MAG labeling was concentrated in the soma of a subset of oligodendrocytes, which expressed breast carcinoma amplified sequence 1, a marker for new oligodendrocytes. While their abundance was normal, new oligodendrocytes in HD mouse caudate appeared to be impeded in acquiring the expression of MAG and in targeting MAG away from perinuclear punctate structures to processes, signs of impaired maturation. Compared with those in wildtype mouse brains, oligodendrocytes in HD mouse brains had a reduced abundance of small vesicles whereas an increased abundance of large punctate structures in the perinuclear region, implying defective generation of small vesicles transporting MAG from large punctate structures in the soma to processes. The MAG-containing perinuclear punctate structures were negative for proteins specifying trans-Golgi networks, early endosomes, or exosomes but had a minor portion labeled with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1, indicating that the structures where MAG accumulates in the soma are derived from the late endosomal lysosomal compartment. Conclusions. Our study suggests that the decay of the brain white matter in Huntington disease involves a deficit in trafficking of myelin-associated glycoprotein, preventing its proper delivery from the soma of oligodendrocytes to myelin-forming processes.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Moreover, cognitive decline can be caused by neuronal dysfunction that precedes cell death, and this dysfunction is in part produced by altered gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which redox state controls gene expression in neurons are not well understood. DeltaFOSB is a neuronally enriched transcription factor critical for orchestrating gene expression underlying memory, mood, and motivated behaviors. It is dysregulated in many conditions including AD. We showed recently that deltaFOSB forms a redox-sensitive disulfide bond between cysteine 172 (C172) of deltaFOSB and C279 of its preferred binding partner JUND. This bond works as a redox switch to control DNA-binding, based on studies of recombinant proteins in vitro. Here, we show that this redox control of deltaFOSB function in vitro is conserved in vivo. We show that deltaFOSB C172 forms a redox-sensitive disulfide bond with JUND that regulates the stability of this AP1-transcription factor complex and its binding to DNA in cells. We also validate the formation of deltaFOSB-containing complexes held together via disulfide bonds in mouse brain in vivo. We show that exogenous oxidative stress reduces deltaFOSB binding to gene targets in mouse brain and that Fosb C172S knock-in mice, which lack a functional deltaFOSB redox switch, are insensitive to this oxidation-dependent reduction in target gene binding, demonstrating that deltaFOSB is regulated by a redox switch that modulates binding to target genes in the hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrate that FosB C172S knock-in mice are less sensitive to cognitive dysfunction induced by oxidative stress. This evidence supports deltaFOSB as an important mediator of oxidative stress-driven changes in gene expression and cognition and implicates deltaFOSB as a possible therapeutic target for diseases associated with oxidative stress in the brain, including AD.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

In the task, a timing cue flashed three times in succession. Potential targets were displayed at the time of the first flash and the monkey needed to initiate the movement almost simultaneously with the third flash. Colorings of potential targets indicated the probability that the target would be at one location or the other, thereby inducing varying levels of uncertainty about the final target location. On half the trials, the final target was displayed so late that the monkey had to \"guess\" the target location, based on cues provided by the potential targets. While the monkey performed this task, we recorded 165 neurons from PMd and 37 from M1. Population neural trajectories in the preparatory subspace of PMd (but not M1) were progressively less expansive with higher levels of uncertainty. Despite differences in preparatory states associated with uncertainty, the movements produced were the same. The narrower separation between states suggested a neural-based explanation for more rapid movement re-preparation with higher uncertainty.

Although considered safe at low concentrations, recent evidence questions their biological inertness under chronic exposure. This study evaluated the developmental, biochemical, and behavioural effects of continuous dietary MP and EP exposure in Drosophila melanogaster, an established in vivo model for toxicological screening. Flies were chronically exposed to MP (0.5 to 2%) or EP (0.5 to 1.5%) throughout development and adulthood. Developmental timing, lifespan, oxidative-stress markers (MDA, FRAP, total protein), and locomotor performance (negative geotaxis in adults, crawling in larvae) were quantified. Paraben exposure significantly delayed development (a 15% increase in eclosion time), reduced median lifespan (up to a 50% decrease at 2% MP), and increased oxidative damage (MDA and FRAP) in a dose-dependent manner. Protein content declined more rapidly with age, suggesting oxidative degradation or proteolysis. Both adult climbing and larval crawling performances were impaired, indicating a link between biochemical stress and neuromuscular dysfunction. MP produced stronger oxidative and behavioural effects than EP. Feeding controls confirmed that observed deficits were not due to nutritional differences. Chronic MP and EP exposure induces systemic toxicity in D. melanogaster, integrating endocrine disruption and redox imbalance as plausible mechanisms of action. Given conserved stress and hormonal pathways, these findings reinforce the need to re-evaluate low dose paraben safety limits and highlight Drosophila as a rapid, ethically viable platform for screening environmental preservatives and safer substitutes.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Here we identify an innate immune barrier, wherein host macrophages selectively recognize and eliminate viable xenogeneic donor cells. These events represent a form of phagoptosis and highlight a xenogeneic clearance process that we term xenophagocytosis. We identify the mechanism by which host macrophages selectively phagocytize xenogeneic donor cells: xenogeneic cells display elevated phosphatidylserine, an \"eat-me\" signal recognized by host macrophages through phagocytic receptor Axl. Xenophagocytosis blockade improves both rat and human donor chimerism in mouse embryos, indicating a conserved mechanism.

Treatment barrier(s) need to be capable of simultaneously controlling cyanobacteria, cyanotoxins, and co-occurring contaminants like bloom associated antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) particularly in the case of recycling treated wastewater. Ozone nanobubble technology has emerged as a promising innovation, offering extended oxidative stability and enhanced interfacial reactivity compared to conventional ozonation. Hence this research objectives are to (a) assess the removal performance of ozone nanobubbles in eliminating cyanobacteria and their co-occurring contaminants in comparison to conventional ozone systems, and (b) investigate the repeatability of the results in varying background water qualities, ozone decay and the potential for by-products formation. Ozonation using nanobubble enhanced oxidation performance by 19%-34% in the drinking water reservoir compared to conventional ozonation while keeping the ozone concentration below 2mg/l. Lower oxidation efficiencies were observed in treated wastewater compared to drinking water sources, reflecting the higher content of organic matter and suspended solids, and oxidant demand characteristic of recycled water systems. Despite these challenges, ozone nanobubbles consistently outperformed conventional ozonation in reducing both cyanobacterial biomass and cell viability, underscoring their potential as an advanced polishing step for algal management in wastewater reuse applications. By exploring fate of ARGs alongside cyanobacteria and toxin removal, this work extends beyond traditional ozonation trials. It provides valuable field-based evidence that bridges the divide between laboratory efficacy and full-scale operational performance. Future studies should build on this by exploring combined or sequential treatment barriers that enhance DNA degradation, thereby addressing both cellular and genetic risks in water supply and reuse systems. Observing the action of nanobubbles under dynamic, real-world water quality conditions is currently challenging; however, this study novel field trials demonstrate potential nanobubble applications and provide valuable insights to guide future investigations. The results reinforce the broader applicability of ozone nanobubble technology for multi-target contaminant control in water reservoirs.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

However, the functional understanding of secreted proteoforms, including whether they act synergistically or antagonistically with their membrane precursors, is often unknown. We aimed to develop a novel viral vector-based gene delivery platform enabling characterization of both membrane-bound and soluble proteoforms in adipocytes, independent of endogenous shedding. Results: We describe a novel platform, termed EctoShed, that achieves expression of proteoforms of amine oxidase copper-containing 3 (AOC3) in adipocytes by capitalising on both the established lentiviral (LV) and AAV gene delivery systems, expressing full-length or a soluble AOC3 mimic (m-sAOC3) isoforms. In vitro transduction of primary white adipocytes induced significant expression of both isoforms, retaining AOC3 enzymatic activity. In vivo delivery to inguinal white adipose tissue enabled depot-specific AOC3 expression and increased abundance of m-sAOC3 in the serum. Mice expressing m-sAOC3 exhibited reduced fat mass and fasting glucose levels.

To better understand the mechanism of Eya-mediated transcriptional co-activation, we find that Eya forms biomolecular condensates with liquid-like properties. These condensates function as possible transcription hubs, through the compartmentalization of key eye development regulators, the transcription factors So, Dac, Optix, Ey, and the kinase Nemo, RNA Pol II machinery, P300/CBP, and show the presence of target RNAs. We map the PST-TPM-PST region of Eya, which is critical for transcriptional co-activation and eye development, to be crucial for condensate formation as well. We identify a human deafness-associated mutation mapping to a conserved Drosophila site in the PST-TPM-PST region, which impairs transcriptional co-activation and shifts the material property of the Eya condensates to a less dynamic state. Our findings thus provide evidence that the condensation of Eya and its dynamic state are integral to transcription regulation and its role in development and disease mechanisms.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

I.; Schelle, J.; Hannezo, E.; Heisenberg, C.-P.", "abstract": "Cleavage - the series of rapid cell divisions that follow fertilization - marks the onset of metazoan development and represents a deeply conserved evolutionary process. Across animals, two principal modes exist: complete (holoblastic) and incomplete (meroblastic) cleavage. While holoblastic cleavage resembles conventional cytokinesis both in vitro and in vivo, the mechanisms underlying meroblastic cleavage have remained poorly understood. Using zebrafish embryos as a model, we show that meroblastic cleavage proceeds through a distinct two-step mechanism. The process begins with the assembly and contraction of a large, arc-shaped actomyosin cable. However, this contractile event alone is insufficient to complete division. A second phase, driven by cadherin-mediated membrane adhesion, is required to invaginate the furrow ridge. Strikingly, this transition depends on mechanical uncoupling of the contractile cable from the surrounding cortex. We demonstrate that such uncoupling arises from an active nematic instability, which both enhances contractility along the cable and generates actin depletion zones that relieve lateral connections. Together, these findings reveal that meroblastic cleavage is governed not by a single actomyosin-based event but by a sequential interplay between cytoskeletal contraction and cadherin-dependent adhesion, highlighting a mechanism fundamentally distinct from canonical cytokinesis.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We introduce the BirdsPlus Index (BPI), a novel, scalable approach that integrates monitoring data, remote sensing, and conservation-weighted species scores to quantify deviations of observed site scores from spatiotemporally explicit expectations. Using nearly 29,000 recordings from the Macaulay Library, we generated acoustic checklists with the Merlin and BirdNET sound identification models under multiple detection thresholds. We matched these acoustic checklists with species-specific conservation values (BirdsPlus species scores), then trained random forest models to predict total, site-level biodiversity (the sum of these species scores) given environmental and effort covariates. The resulting model also enabled us to map expected BirdsPlus site scores across the landscape. These scores integrate information on species' conservation status, ecological roles, and phylogenetic and functional uniqueness. BPI was calculated as the residual between observed and expected site scores, thereby providing a direct site-level measure of conservation value. Across 30 sites, we found that BPI values were consistent across acoustic models and detection thresholds, with high-scoring sites supporting regionally uncommon breeders and habitat specialists. While acoustic- and observer-based (eBird) models showed differing spatial patterns, both aligned with known ecological drivers such as urban density, elevation, and wetland cover. Our results demonstrate that acoustic checklists can be used to model expected biodiversity over time and space, and that the BPI provides a robust, interpretable metric for evaluating the ecological integrity of local sites. Beyond its immediate application to conservation planning, this framework lays the foundation for global, real-time biodiversity monitoring that leverages automated acoustic classifiers, citizen science, and remote sensing to integrate conservation value into development and management decisions.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We isolate ecosystem productivity changes to trace their propagation through food systems across three socioeconomic scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) by coupling the CLASSIC land surface model with GCAM integrated assessment model. Productivity changes lead to crops systematically shifting from human consumption to animal feed and bioenergy (up to 15% reallocation), while there is a significant transition of managed agricultural lands to unmanaged lands by up to 6 million square kilometers as productivity gains enable less intensive land use. These changes drive extreme regional divergence, with food production volume changing from +35% to -28% and substantial portfolio reorganization. Disruptions peak under regional rivalry (SSP3-7.0), revealing how fragmented governance amplifies biophysical feedbacks beyond climate forcing alone.

E.; Viermann, C.; James, M.; Banks, C. S.; Hawley, R. S. E.", "abstract": "Organisms use a specialized cell division called meiosis for the creation of haploid gametes. Multiple carefully orchestrated steps must occur at specific times and places for meiosis to be successful, including chromosome pairing, meiotic entry, recombination, synapsis, and two rounds of chromosome segregation. The regulation and molecular mechanisms for many of the steps of meiosis have not been fully elucidated. During synapsis, the synaptonemal complex (SC) builds along the entire lengths of the homologs to maintain the pairing of the homologs and promote the formation of the crossovers that help ensure proper segregation of homologs at the meiosis I division in many organisms. The SC is a large tripartite structure that is believed to function as a biomolecular condensate. To attempt to identify proteins that interact with SC components during female meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster, a protein of the lateral element, C(2)M, and a protein of the central element, Cona, were tagged with the APEX2 enzyme, which can biotinylate nearby proteins under the appropriate conditions. Under biotinylating promoting conditions, biotin labeled proteins were observed to be associated with the SC by immunofluorescence. Biotinylated proteins were isolated for mass spectrometry analysis, and multiple proteins were found to be enriched compared to control samples. RNAi knockdown lines targeting a subset of enriched proteins were examined for phenotypes in early Drosophila female meiosis. RNAi knockdown of Cpsf5 , an mRNA cleavage factor, caused delayed or defective SC formation, as well as additional meiotic defects, indicating a role for maturation of mRNA in regulating processes of female meiosis.

For perturbations that do alter the transcriptomic state of cells, intracellular guide RNA abundance exhibits a dose-response association with perturbation efficacy. We combine (i) per-perturbation, expression-only classifiers trained with non-negative negative-unlabeled (nnNU) risk to yield calibrated scores reflecting the perturbation state of single cells and (ii) a monotone guide abundance prior to yield a per-cell pseudo-posterior that supports both assignment of perturbation probability and selection of affected gene features. To obtain a low-dimensional representation that allows for the accurate reconstruction of gene-level marginals for counterfactual decoding, we train an autoencoder with a quantile-hurdle reconstruction loss and feature-weighted emphasis on perturbation-affected genes.

Our previous report on MDA-MB-231 cells has also demonstrated its cytotoxic effect against the breast cancer cell lines. In this context, Lantana camara may be of therapeutic potential against breast cancer, and to further understand the mode of action of the leaf extract, its effect on the regulation of miR-181a-5p has been explored. Here, we report that L. camara could upregulate the expression of miR-181a-5p in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines with concomitant decrease in miR-181a target genes, BCL-2, MCL-1, and CDKN3.

DPCs, isolated and expanded under differentiation-suppressive conditions, showed strong tumor-homing ability when injected intraperitoneally into a mouse model of gastric cancer dissemination. Fluorescent imaging and histological analysis confirmed selective accumulation of DPCs within tumor lesions through CXCR4/SDF1 mediated chemotaxis. Introduction of the NIS gene markedly increased SLC5A5 expression and enabled efficient uptake of At-211. High resolution alpha particle imaging visualized alpha ray emission specifically from NIS-DPCs, confirming intracellular retention of the radionuclide.

Most eukaryotes have multiple HSP genes that encode for proteins localizing in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria. In marine invertebrates of the phylum Cnidaria, where HSPs are often used as biomarkers of environmental stress, little is known about how particular HSPs vary in copy number, expression, inducibility, and regulation within a species. In this study, we characterized the diversity of the full repertoire of HSP70 and HSP90 genes in an emerging model cnidarian, Nematostella vectensis. We identified five distinct HSP70 and three HSP90 genes, with at least one homolog from each family belonging to the three primary clades based on subcellular localization. Although transcription of none of these HSPs was significantly induced by a temperature change of 10{degrees}C, two cytosolic HSP70s and one cytosolic HSP90 were significantly upregulated with a 20{degrees}C increase in temperature. Most HSPs followed a similar pattern of expression across various developmental stages of N. vectensis, with an increase in expression during the early larval stage followed by a decrease during the juvenile stage. HSPs showed evidence for differential expression in particular cell types, where multiple cytosolic and ER HSPs were highly expressed in neuronal and cnidocyte cell types. Moreover, there were differences in the abundance and sequences of regulatory heat shock element motifs in the putative promoters of N. vectensis HSPs, providing a potential mechanistic basis of functional diversification in response to temperature and development.

Recent studies suggested no Gi/o-GIRK pre-coupling and low (>250 M) G{beta}{gamma}-GIRK interaction affinity, contradicting earlier sub-M estimates and implying low signaling efficiency. We show that G{gamma} prenylation, which mediates G{beta}{gamma} membrane attachment required for GIRK activation, also contributes to the G{beta}{gamma}-GIRK interaction, explaining the poor affinity obtained with non-prenylated G{beta}{gamma}. Using quantitative protein titration and electrophysiology in live Xenopus oocytes, G{beta}{gamma} affinity for homotetrameric GIRK2 ranged from 4-30 M. Heterotetrameric GIRK1/2 showed a higher G{beta}{gamma} apparent affinity due to unique G{beta}{gamma}-docking site (anchor) in GIRK1, which enriches G{beta}{gamma} at the channel. Biochemical approaches and molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the G{beta}{gamma} anchor is formed by interacting N-terminal and distal C-terminal domains of the GIRK1 subunits, distinct from the G{beta}{gamma}-binding activation site(s) underlying channel opening. Thus, the affinity of G{beta}{gamma}-GIRK interaction is within the expected physiological range, while dynamic pre-coupling of G{beta}{gamma} to GIRK1-containing channels through high-affinity interactions further enhances the GPCR-Gi/o-GIRK signaling efficiency.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

A complex network of regulators includes the gasotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) known to inhibit primary root growth, modify root architecture and alter meristem organisation. However, little is known about the molecular targets and the mechanistic insights of this signalling molecule during root SCN homeostasis. Here, genetic, molecular and physiological evidence support that TGA transcription factors of the bZIP family, and specifically PERIANTHIA (PAN), contribute to NO-mediated root stem cell regulation. NO induces reversible S-nitrosylation of PAN, thereby inhibiting its binding to DNA and associated transcriptional activation. In turn, the protein-SNO reductase activity of TRXh5 is able to denitrosylate PAN. This switch on and off mechanism of PAN activation modulates WOX5 expression and quiescent centre activity, which alters columella stem cell maintenance through a NO-dependent mechanism. Different TGA members interact with PAN and are also S-nitrosylated, whose expression in the root SCN together with their accumulated mutations contribute to NO sensing during root apical meristem development. Collectively, these findings reveal a molecular framework where NO controls the ability of PAN to bind to its targets as a master regulator of the root SCN.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Fields like oncology have overcome these problems to take advantage of the insight that sequencing offers for understanding mechanisms of disease and have leveraged these molecular insights to dramatically change the treatment landscape in the past decade. Here we tested the hypothesis that skin biopsies could be used to gain insight into neuronal transcriptomic changes in patients with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). Our analysis reveals that hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found through bulk RNA sequencing in these skin biopsies are likely contributed by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal axons and/or terminals. Up-regulated genes were representative of broad class of nociceptors whereas down-regulated genes were associated with putative injured DRG neurons expressing the PDIA2 gene. DEGs that could be confidently associated with specific subsets of skin cells were mostly expressed by keratinocytes supporting a growing literature tying keratinocyte-neuron communication abnormalities to pain in PIPN. Our findings warrant further assessment of skin biopsies in additional neuropathic pain populations to gain insight into DRG neuron changes that have previously been thought to be inaccessible in routine clinical or scientific assessment in most patients.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

As human-human pairs have unrivaled skills in physical collaboration tasks, we take the approach of understanding and applying biomimetic concepts to human-robot interaction. Here, we apply the concept of passer movement cues, that is, slower movement for heavy objects and faster movements for lighter objects, to robot-human handovers. We first show that when a simulated passing agent's movement is scaled with object mass, participants as receivers adapt their anticipatory grip forces according to mass in a virtual environment. We then apply the same concept to a physical robot-human handover and show that our approach generalizes to the real-world. The predictive scaling of grip forces is learned iteratively upon repeated presentations of trajectory-mass pairings, whether the masses are presented in a random or blocked order. Overall we demonstrate that the presentation of robotic kinematic cues can provide intuitive and naturalistic human predictive control in object handover. This extends the use of non-verbal cues in robot-human handover tasks and facilitates more legible and efficient physical robot-human interactions.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Microglia undergo significant changes with aging, including alterations in morphology, that may reflect or contribute to cognitive dysfunction. However, the relationship between specific microglial morphologies and cognitive performance in relevant brain regions remains poorly understood. To address this, we evaluated the relationship between morphology-based microglial phenotypes and cognitive performance across domains affected by aging. Microglial morphology was analyzed in four cognitive brain regions of male and female 3-, 9-, and 15-month-old rats and features were subjected to hierarchical clustering on principal components to identify microglial subtypes. Rats underwent cognitive testing using a radial arm water maze and a T-maze set-shifting task to assess spatial working and reference memory, striatal-based learning, and cognitive flexibility. We observed age-related cognitive impairments alongside region-specific changes in microglial morphotype abundance. Importantly, the relative abundance of distinct microglial clusters correlated with cognitive performance in functionally relevant brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the hippocampus. Taken together, these findings highlight the utility of morphological profiling in capturing microglial heterogeneity and suggest that morphological changes may reflect or contribute to cognitive decline during aging.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Because microglia are implicated in schizophrenia risk and disease states, we further investigated what role microglia may play in the development of mismatch responses under physiological conditions. We found that microglial depletion with PLX5622 in adolescence arrests the development of resting oscillations in frontal areas, but does not affect the development of deviance detection, other signatures of visual context processing, or prefrontal-visual functional connectivity.

CMT2A is mainly caused by dominant mutations in the MFN2 gene, encoding Mitofusin-2, a GTPase located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations in MFN2 are known to affect mitochondrial dynamics. We previously demonstrated that the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln further disrupts contacts between the ER and the mitochondria, leading to progressive axonal degeneration. There is no effective therapeutic approach to slow or reverse the progression of CMT2A, and treatments currently under development primarily focus on restoring mitochondrial function. Here, we provide proof-of-concept that neuronal overexpression of wild-type MFN2 (MFN2WT) provides therapeutic benefit in transgenic CMT2A mice carrying the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln. Intrathecal delivery of an AAV9 vector expressing MFN2WT effectively targets motor and sensory neurons, restoring ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial morphology, thereby preserving both neuromuscular junction integrity and motor function. Strikingly, therapeutic efficacy is also achieved following vector injection after the onset of symptoms, rescuing the molecular hallmarks of CMT2A pathology and reversing locomotor. Notably, AAV administration was well tolerated, with no evidence neither of hepatotoxicity nor dorsal root ganglion inflammation.

Given limited neural resources, it is expected that stronger representations of the distractor will result in weaker representations of the target, leading to poorer behavioral performance. We tested this hypothesis by recording fMRI while participants (n = 27) viewed a compound stimulus consisting of randomly moving dots (the target) superimposed on IAPS affective pictures (the distractor). Each trial lasted ~12 seconds, during which the moving dots and the IAPS pictures were flickered at 4.29 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively. The task was to detect and report brief episodes of coherent motion in the moving dots. Depending on the emotion category of the IAPS pictures, the trials were classified as pleasant, neutral and unpleasant. Focusing on three ROIs: middle temporal cortex (MT), ventral visual cortex (VVC), as well as the primary visual cortex (V1), we performed MVPA analysis to decode the distractor categories in each ROI, and correlated the decoding accuracy, taken to index the strength of distractor representation, with the accuracy in detecting the episodes of coherent motion. The following results were found: (1) the decoding accuracy was above chance level in all ROIs, and (2) in MT and VVC but not in V1, the higher the decoding accuracy, the worse the behavioral performance. These results suggested that distractor information was represented in V1 as well as in the two motion-processing areas, and in the motion-processing areas, stronger representations of the distractor led to poorer ability to process attended information, leading to worse behavioral performance. The hypothesis was thus supported and trade-offs in the fidelity of stimulus representations prompted by neural competition demonstrated.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

However, the intrinsic spatiotemporal dynamics of SAR in human placentation remain poorly understood, largely due to the limited availability of high-quality maternal-fetal interface specimens. Electively terminated early pregnancies offer a valuable resource for studying SAR in situ, yet inconsistent methods for distinguishing fragmented villous and decidual tissues have hindered reproducibility and interpretation. Herein we present a standardized protocol for the classification and characterization of high-quality maternal-fetal interface specimens from elective terminations by integrating stereomicroscopic evaluation with confirmation by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Combined with multiplex immunofluorescence imaging with cell type specific markers, this approach enabled precise spatial mapping and quantification of key morphological and cellular events in SAR from gestational weeks 5 to 10. Our analyses reveal that SAR initiates as early as week 5 with extraluminal recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells, followed by the formation of tightly packed EVT plugs within the lumens of spiral arteries in the decidua compacta; these plugs progressively extend deeper into the vessels and gradually loosen as gestation progresses. Notably, enEVTs appear to acquire NK cell-like phenotypes that may facilitate the displacement of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, promoting progressive vessel dilation. In summary, we provide a robust and reproducible method for assessing physiological SAR in early human pregnancy, promoting the adoption of our methodology in future studies of pathological SAR and related pregnancy disorders.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

In species distribution models (SDMs), spatial scale can strongly affect model predictions and performance. Despite this, the choice of scale is often overlooked. The development of SDMs using deep learning models has enabled spatially structured data, such as patches of environmental raster data, to be considered as model inputs, making the question of scale even more crucial. Here, we evaluate convolutional neural network-based multi-species SDMs considering different scales on a dataset from Switzerland, including more than 8 million observations for 2390 plant and 1006 animal species comprising amphibians, butterflies, beetles, and mammals. We investigate how scale affects model performance and compare single- and multi-scale models. Our results reveal stronger scale effects for remote sensing indices than for bioclimatic and edaphic variables. In single-scale models, we find that plant species perform better with smaller spatial scales, while the opposite is true for animal species. Multi-scale models consistently improve predictive performance and reduce sensitivity to arbitrary scale selection across all modalities and taxonomic groups. The effect of scale is nonetheless smaller than the increase in performance achieved by considering multiple predictor groups. To improve the interpretability of such complex models, we use attribution methods to compute the relative contribution of different scales and predictor groups. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for scale and the potential of deep learning methods to integrate ecological complexity with spatial data across scales.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

S.; Singh, N.; Bharj, G.", "abstract": "Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) are emerging tools for predicting an individuals genetic risk for complex diseases. However, their usefulness in clinical practice remains limited because most existing models are based on data from people of European ancestry, leading to reduced accuracy and stability in other populations. This imbalance restricts the equitable use of PRS in precision medicine. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Multi-Ancestry Portfolio-Based Polygenic Risk Scores (MAP-PRS) a new framework that combines mathematical modeling and data science principles to improve both fairness and reliability in genetic risk prediction across populations. MAP-PRS treats each ancestry-specific PRS as part of a portfolio, similar to how investments are managed in finance, balancing two key aspects: predictive return (how well the score predicts disease) and risk complexity (how uncertain or ancestry-specific the prediction is). By jointly optimizing these factors, MAP-PRS identifies the best combination of ancestry-informed PRS models that maximize predictive accuracy while minimizing bias and instability. This approach also uses advanced computational tools such as Bayesian modeling, machine learning, and generative neural networks to refine risk estimates, incorporate environmental and lifestyle factors, and increase representation from under-studied populations. In doing so, MAP-PRS supports more inclusive, equitable, and interpretable precision medicine. As an initial demonstration, MAP-PRS has been applied to predict Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) risk in European ancestry populations, establishing a foundation for broader, multi-ancestry implementation. Future extensions will include additional diseases, such as cervical cancer and HPV susceptibility, endometrioid ovarian cancer, and Alzheimers disease bringing us closer to clinically actionable and globally equitable genetic risk prediction.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Using all-versus-all exhaustive comparisons across the 20,647 human proteins, we systematically identify novel paralogs and assess their catalytic residues for two serine protease clans. We discovered 14 previously uncharacterized human serine carboxypeptidases, validated against experimentally determined PDB structures, with 11 of these displaying conserved catalytic triads. We further identify 203 new paralogs for human kinases, with 163 of these in the major clusters that represent previously uncharacterized kinase subtypes and 30 putative novel human transcription factors. Across both serine protease subtypes, structural alignments enable the prediction of the previously unknown catalytic residues for those lacking UniProt annotations of active site residues.

We demonstrate that using a non-charged intrinsically disordered protein, ion-dependent kosmotropic effect can encode measurable pH and interphase potential gradients into condensate. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations further reveal that the distinct intrinsic transfer free energy of ions defines the ion partitioning capability of condensates via favorable interactions with protein backbones.

These built-in potentials modulate the partitioning and reactivity of charged solutes, enabling non-enzymatic, potential-dependent chemistry within condensates.

We have previously shown that methylmalonic acid (MMA), a byproduct of propionate metabolism that accumulates when the pathway is disrupted, can activate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cell lines. But the clinical significance of propionate metabolism in cancer patients is not known. Here we show, for the first time, that propionate metabolism is dysregulated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. MMA is elevated in lung tumors and in the serum of patients with metastatic NSCLC. Metabolism of cobalamin associated B (MMAB), a key regulatory gene of propionate metabolism, is downregulated in NSCLC and drug-tolerant persister cells, leading to MMA accumulation and EMT activation.

This report demonstrates that the papillomavirus transcription/replication/segregation factor E2 activates the DNA damage response (DDR). During differentiation, E2 displacement of CIP2A from TOPBP1 causes CIP2A to bind and inhibit PP2A resulting in DDR activation via ATM phosphorylation. The DDR promotes inhibitory interaction of DBC1 with the class III deacetylase SIRT1, which further boosts the DDR via increased acetylation and stability of viral and host proteins. E2 forms a complex with TOPBP1 and ATM, while preventing ATR activation by blocking TOPBP1-ATR interaction. This ATM up ATR down phenotype promotes viral replication via ATM promotion of homologous recombination, and cell proliferation via inhibition of ATR. We demonstrate this mechanism of DDR activation in multiple systems: keratinocytes expressing only E2, in foreskin keratinocytes immortalized by HPV16, in HPV16 positive keratinocytes derived from a cervical lesion, in pre-neoplastic lesions induced by mouse papillomavirus MmuPV1, in head and neck cancer cell lines that retain E2 expression, and in HPV16 positive oropharyngeal patient derived xenografts that retain E2 expression. ATM inhibition preferentially killed cells expressing E2, presenting a novel strategy for treating HPV early preneoplasia and a large subset of HPV+ oropharyngeal cancers retaining E2 expression and episomal genomes.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "The post-translational regulation of tumor suppressors by oncogenic kinases remains a critical yet underexplored determinant of proteostasis reprogramming in cancer. Here, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-Interacting Protein) as a direct and functionally relevant substrate of the serine/threonine kinase CK2 alpha, which is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors. Using LC/MS analysis, in silico kinase prediction, and molecular interaction mapping, we demonstrated that CK2 alpha phosphorylates CHIP at serine 19 (represented as S19), a conserved residue within its TPR domain, thereby promoting ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of CHIP. This phosphorylation-dependent destabilization of CHIP impairs its ability to target oncogenic substrates, such as AKT, resulting in sustained AKT phosphorylation and activation, required for oncogenesis. Clinically, we observed a robust inverse correlation between CK2 alpha and CHIP expressions across colorectal and breast cancer patient datasets, which was validated by immunofluorescence (IF) analyses in tumor samples. Multiple functional assays revealed that CK2 alpha suppression, either by genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition by TBCA, restores CHIP stability, reactivates apoptotic signalling cascades, and attenuates tumor cell proliferation, migration, and 3D spheroid integrity. Moreover, CK2 alpha blockade in syngeneic murine models diminishes primary tumor burden and metastatic dissemination, concomitant with increased CHIP accumulation and reduced AKT signalling. Mechanistically, a phosphorylation-resistant mutant of CHIP at S19 (CHIP-S19A), is refractory to CK2 alpha-mediated degradation and preserves anti-tumor functions, delineating a phosphorylation-dependent proteolytic switch as a central node in the CK2 alpha-CHIP-AKT regulatory axis. These findings establish a novel paradigm wherein an oncogenic kinase hijacks protein quality control pathway to suppress tumor suppressive activity and facilitate malignancy. Our study positions CK2 alpha; as a druggable modulator of CHIP turnover, offering a translational framework for restoring proteostatic checkpoints and constraining oncogenic signalling in aggressive cancers.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We used processed-based temperature-driven physiological models to assess the impact of changing climate conditions between 1951 and 2022 across North America on eight important forest pest insects, namely western spruce budworm, eastern spruce budworm, spongy moth, hemlock woolly adelgid, mountain pine beetle, southern pine beetle, spruce beetle and emerald ash borer. Our analyses revealed substantial changes in climate suitability resulting in pronounced northward and elevational shifts for most pest species although the magnitude and spatial patterns of these shifts varied both geographically and among species. We also showed that shifts in highly suitable conditions were more important at the colder edge (either northern or upper elevation) than at the warmer boundaries for several species, either driven by the Arctic amplification or elevation-dependant warming. Our results indicated that both the total area and the host tree biomass exposed to highly suitable climate conditions have increased for many pest species over the last decades, further exposing ecosystems to elevated risk. Our analyses also identified areas (e.g., western Canada) that are increasingly exposed to overlapping, potentially cumulative and interacting, biological disturbances. We also showed that climate change has already contributed to increasing the climatic suitability and geographic spread of exotic forest pest species in North America. Changes in climate suitability over the past seven decades across North America likely represent early signals of continued and potentially accelerating shifts under ongoing anthropogenic climate forcing. In this context, efforts to limit the expansion of pest populations under future climate change scenarios will be key to mitigating their cultural, ecological and economic impacts.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

In Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Ghana, rice productivity is often limited by poor soil fertility. Farmers frequently apply high nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates to boost yields; however, excessive nitrogen use contributes to environmental problems such as nutrient leaching and pollution. While optimal nitrogen application rates have been extensively studied, limited research has focused on varietal responses among rice genotypes. This study evaluated the response of five rice varieties (CRI-Agra Rice, Togo Marshall, CRI-Amankwatia, CRI-Enapa, and Jasmine 85) to different nitrogen rates (0, 30, 60, and 90 kg N/ha), focusing on morphophysiological, biomass and yield-related traits. The findings showed significant (p < 0.001) variations in these traits with increasing nitrogen levels. Application of 90 kg N/ha led to substantial improvements: 40% increase in chlorophyll content, 34.3% in culm length, 71.4% in panicle number, 28.3% in straw dry weight and 42.9% in grain yield over the control (0 kg N/ha). Nitrogen significantly promoted vegetative growth, delayed flowering and enhanced biomass and grain production. Genotypic differences in nitrogen use efficiency were also observed. Togo Marshall, CRI-Agra Rice and Jasmine 85 showed over 30% increases in chlorophyll content, while CRI-Enapa exhibited higher plant height and panicle number at 90 kg N/ha. Togo Marshall and CRI-Enapa recorded the highest biomass and yield responses, indicating superior nitrogen utilization. Overall, CRI-Enapa and Togo Marshall performed best at 60-90 kg N/ha.

It is well established that changes in ion gradients drive water movement into and out of the guard cell, thereby altering cell volume and modulating the opening or closing of the stomatal pore.

The role of endomembrane trafficking networks in stomatal dynamics is not well characterized. Here, we investigated the regulation of stomatal opening and closing by generating a proteome and phosphoproteome of guard cell-enriched tissue. This deep proteome captured a protein profile that was similar to previously characterized guard cell proteomes. The guard cell-enriched tissue with closed stomata showed greater levels of phosphorylation of proteins related to endomembrane trafficking and vacuoles when compared to both whole leaf tissue with closed stomata and guard cell-enriched tissue with open stomata.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; encoded by Serpine1) is highly upregulated in endothelial cells after stroke. Since the primary function of PAI-1 is to inhibit fibrin clot breakdown, we hypothesized that blocking this pathway would be beneficial for recovery since it is expected to increase capillary blood flow after stroke. Using longitudinal in vivo imaging in mice subjected to ischemic stroke, we unexpectedly found that knockdown of Serpine1 in brain endothelial cells leads to a long-lasting reduction in peri-infarct capillary width, red blood cell velocity and flux. Conversely, stimulating this pathway in naive mice increased capillary width and blood flow. Lowered peri-infarct blood flow in Serpine1 knockdown mice attenuated deleterious blood brain barrier disruption and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Serpine1 knockdown improved the progressive recovery of sensory evoked cortical responses, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor function. These findings challenge the assumption that increased blood flow after stroke is better for recovery and reveal that carefully tuning flow, rather than maximizing it, may be optimal. Further our data highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting endothelial Serpine1/PAI-1 signalling in promoting stroke recovery.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

While spike train data is well-approximated with a binary model, here we apply these IG methods to data from electroencephalography (EEG), a continuous signal requiring appropriate discretization strategies. We developed and compared three different binarization methods and used them to identify third-order interactions in an experiment involving imagined motor movements. The statistical significance of these interactions was assessed using phase-randomized surrogate data that eliminated higher-order dependencies while preserving the spectral characteristics of the original signals. We validated our approach by implementing known second- and third-order dependencies in a forward model and quantified information attenuation at different steps of the analysis. This revealed that the greatest loss in information occurred when going from the idealized binary case to enforcing these dependencies using oscillatory signals. When applied to the real EEG dataset, our analysis detected statistically significant third-order interactions during the task condition despite the relatively sparse data (45 trials per condition). This work demonstrates that IG methods can successfully extract genuine higher-order dependencies from continuous neural recordings when paired with appropriate binarization schemes.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Using high-resolution fMRI together with eye tracking as a readout of spatial and semantic memory during sequence learning, we directly tested these competing models. During predictable sequences, hippocampal activity continuously varied along the long axis. In contrast, modular organization emerged when sequences mismatched memory. Subregions in the anterior and posterior hippocampus were sensitive to semantic and spatial mismatches, respectively. Notably, the intermediate hippocampus was specifically sensitive to concurrent mismatches in both dimensions, but not to mismatches in either dimension alone. These content-sensitive subregions were embedded within distinct cortical networks that reorganized according to memory demands.

We investigated sleep across early developmental stages in Drosophila mojavensis, a stress-resilient desert-adapted species. While adult D.mojavensis exhibit prolonged and consolidated sleep, along with enhanced starvation tolerance and survival compared to Drosophila melanogaster, the developmental trajectory underlying these adaptation strategies for surviving in harsh environments is unknown. Moreover, during developmental (larval) periods, animals do not encounter the same environmental stressors experienced by adults (e.g., food scarcity, extreme temperatures). We find that in contrast to adults, D.mojavensis larvae exhibit reduced and fragmented sleep relative to D.melanogaster. D.mojavensis larval sleep is also deeper, reflecting a shift toward increased sleep efficiency rather than simple sleep loss. D.mojavensis larvae consume more food than D.melanogaster and survive longer under starvation, suggesting a strategic tradeoff by suppressing sleep to prioritize nutrient intake and energy storage early in life while resources are more abundant. Metabolic analyses reveal elevated triglyceride accumulation in D.mojavensis across their lifespan, indicating enhanced energy storage capacity. These findings provide an example of how, within a fixed genetic background, an animal can reallocate sleep in opposing manners to maximize survival and energetics depending upon ecological pressures unique to each phase of life.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

To explore how ALS-associated mutations impact UBQLN2 function, we performed quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based interactome analysis using affinity-purified UBQLN2 from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and induced motor neurons (iMNs) expressing wild-type UBQLN2 (UBQLN2WT), a UBQLN2P497H clinical mutant, or a UBQLN24XALS allele harboring four disease mutations.

While tau is reported to drive neurotoxicity by negatively affecting cytoskeletal, nucleoskeletal, and genomic architecture, the mechanisms mediating tau-induced dysfunction of the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton are incompletely understood. Based on proteomic profiling, we identify a suite of cytoskeletal and nucleoskeletal proteins with differing abundance in a cellular model of tauopathy, iTau. Building upon previous findings that pathogenic forms of tau reduce nuclear tension, we find that protein levels of emerin, a central regulator of nuclear mechanotransduction, are significantly elevated in iTau cells and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons carrying a mutation in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene that causes autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia.

Mass spectrometry-based identification of emerin-interacting proteins in iTau-derived neurons reveals increased interactions with cytoskeletal proteins and reduced interactions with nuclear proteins. Indeed, we find that emerin relocalizes from the nucleus to the cytosol in the setting of tauopathy, suggesting that pathogenic tau impacts nuclear mechanotransduction pathways.

First, we tested the individual active substances acetamiprid (insecticide), fluopyram (fungicide) and terbuthylazine (herbicide), detecting acute toxic effects only for acetamiprid. However, the combination of acetamiprid and terbuthylazine significantly increased toxicity compared to acetamiprid alone and the combination of acetamiprid and fluopyram with the effective dose 50 being 2.7 and 2.3 times lower respectively. Strikingly, a triple mixture of all active substances exceeded the toxicity of any other treatment. While the exact mechanisms remain unclear, we speculate that increased physiological stress contributes to the observed synergistic effects, as terbuthylazine and fluopyram have been shown to interfere, though to varying extents, with cellular energy metabolism, oxidative balance, detoxification and neurotransmission in several non-target organisms. These results are concerning and highlight the ecotoxicological uncertainty posed by traces of complex pesticide mixtures present in the air, soil, water and plants across landscapes.

Here, we study growth in a squamate, the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara). We use two large datasets with available pedigree information: one from a wild population in a colder, montane environment; the other from an experimental population in a warmer, lowland environment. We found slower growth and larger asymptotic sizes in the colder population. We also found faster growth to lower asymptotic sizes for males. Inferences using a non-linear animal model show very low to moderate heritabilities in the parameters of individual growth curves, varying across populations and sexes. The decomposition of the additive genetic variance show a small to moderate heritability of the overall growth curves, with a stronger importance of the heritability in the shape of growth curves (variation in the dynamics of growth) than on their offset (variation between smaller and larger individuals). Genetic variation in growth curves differed between the two populations, with higher heritabilities in the experimental population. It also differed between sexes: there was more genetic variation in the growth rate at earlier ages for males, while genetic variation was larger for asymptotic size and at later ages for females. Our results tend to show that there is more adaptive potential in the earlier ages for males and in the later ages for females, which seems to be linked to their different life-history strategies.

This work bridges developmental gene regulation with disease genetics, providing a foundation for mechanistic and therapeutic insights into congenital diseases.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

By directly imaging extracted and vitrified chromatin, we preserve native structure and avoid artifacts from heavy metal staining and resin embedding. Using three-dimensional (3D) density analysis, we measure chromatin density and capture the progressive increase in chromatin compaction with lineage commitment. This is then correlated with population-averaged Hi-C experiments, observing consistency between the microscale higher order structure of chromatin and global contact patterns. Our approach enables direct visualization of chromatin organization under near-physiological conditions, bridging the gap between structural imaging and genome-wide contact mapping.

The hybrid models were evaluated using historical mortality data from the United States, covering ages 35 to 80 years from 1975 to 2020. Among the models tested, the LSTM model outperformed all others, demonstrating superior capability in capturing time dependencies and producing more accurate mortality forecasts. The integration of LSTM with the Lee-Carter framework led to significant improvements in predictive accuracy. This research demonstrates that combining traditional statistical approaches with modern deep learning techniques, particularly LSTM, offers a powerful method for enhancing mortality forecasting by effectively modeling time-dependent patterns.

M.; Hudson, R.", "abstract": "The ion channel TRPV1 is expressed in the peripheral nervous system where it mediates heat sensation and pain signaling. How lipids contribute to TRPV1 regulation remains an open topic. Although an inhibitory binding site for phosphoinositides was identified at the vanilloid site in TRPV1 structures, a mechanism for phosphatidylinositol-2-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to both inhibit and potentiate TRPV1 activity is lacking. This gap in knowledge led us to examine structural and sequence overlap between TRPV1 and the PI(4,5)P2 binding site of TRPV5. In a space located adjacent to the turn from S6 to TRP helices, we identify a second, possible PI(4,5)P2 binding site in TRPV1, which we term the 'front porch' site and includes residue H410. On the one hand, we obtained electrophysiological evidence with the TRPV1-H410R mutant that PI(4,5)P2 associates with TRPV1 at the front porch site through an electrostatic interaction to potentiate channel activity. On the other hand, the charge reversal in H410D conferred an increase in channel activity, which was not expected if the electrostatic interaction with PI(4,5)P2 is lost and channel function is crippled. Importantly, capsaicin activated currents from H410D experience significant current run-up, consistent with the slow displacement by capsaicin of a tighter-bound lipid in the vanilloid site, which structures suggest is phosphoinositide (PI). Lastly, we tested TRPV1-H410D sensitivity to PI(4,5)P2 manipulations by dephosphorylating the membrane pool of PI(4,5)P2 to PI with the Pseudojanin rapamycin-phosphatase (PJ) system. Depletion of PI(4,5)P2 with the PJ-system in wild type channels induces 1) a robust increase in baseline activity as channels are released from inhibition and 2) loss of current potentiation, driven by PI(4,5)P2 dissociation from the front porch, both of which were absent in TRPV1-H410D. Based on these findings we hypothesize that plasma membrane TRPV1-H410D maintains PI rather than PI(4,5)P2 in its vanilloid site and does not interact with PI(4,5)P2 in the front porch site. We integrated our discoveries that H410 interacts with PI(4,5)P2 at two distinct sites in a mutually exclusive manner and present a cohesive model for phosphoinositide inhibition and potentiation in TRPV1, addressing a maturation process for TRPV1 that relies on H410 to coordinate the exchange of PI for PI(4,5)P2.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Superradiance (SR) arises when fluorophores radiate collectively rather than independently, producing ultrabright emission bursts. Recent experiments show that dye-labeled virus-like particles (VLPs) can exhibit SR at room temperature, where the VLP scaffold organizes dyes into a macrodipole of coherent emitters under pulsed excitation. To elucidate the biophysical basis of this phenomenon, microsecond-scale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on intact Brome mosaic virus (BMV) VLPs, comparing the native scaffold to a capsid decorated with Oregon Green 488 (OG). Results show that OG conjugation at K105 induces only subtle structural changes: a slight expansion of VLP volume and marginally higher inter-subunit flexibility, while overall shell morphology and pore architecture remain intact. However, dianionic OG alters VLP electrostatics, increasing water exchange across the shell and reducing chloride permeability. Dyes bound in pentamers are more closely packed and conformationally restricted than those in hexamers, and their transition dipoles more frequently adopt parallel orientations predicted to favor excitonic coupling and cooperative emission. By examining the role of scaffold architecture in dye interactions and dynamics, this work offers a mechanistic framework and design principles for engineering SR-VLPs as next-generation fluorescent probes and photonic materials.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Lymphatic vessels facilitate the escape of cancer cells and can support further metastatic dissemination. Although the clinical and experimental evidence supports a role for lymph node metastases in promoting metastatic spread, the mechanism employed by cancer cells to navigate a lymphatic endothelium and enter lymphatic vessels is poorly characterized. To investigate this, we assessed the interactions between cancer cells and lymphatic endothelial cells and found that Tks5-positive structures, termed invadopodia, remodel lymphatic endothelial junctions. Loss of Tks5 impaired cancer cell invasion across a lymphatic endothelium and significantly reduced lymph node and lung metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer progression. Surgical removal of the axillary and brachial lymph nodes prior to orthotopic cancer cell injection resulted in a significant reduction in lung tumor burden, further demonstrating the significance of lymph node metastases to metastatic tumor burden. Next, using breast cancer patient primary tumors we found that elevated expression of CCR7, a chemokine receptor, significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. CCR7 localized to invadopodia and promoted cancer cell invasion across lymphatic endothelium, both in the presence and absence of its canonical ligand CCL19. Tyrosine phosphorylation of CCR7 directed the recruitment of Vav2 and activation of Rac3.

This study employed a kinetic pain empathy paradigm, manipulating the congruence between pain expressions, i.e., body gestures and facial expressions based on a predictive coding framework. We collected EEG data from 51 autistic and 58 neurotypical adults during a pain observation task. Results indicated that autistic and neurotypical adults share a similar neural architecture for empathy processing and conflict resolution, involving an early stage of sensory arousal (i.e., N2 and theta) and a later stage of cognitive reappraisal (i.e., P3). However, the multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed nuanced but significant between-group differences in neural patterns. Compared to neurotypical peers, autistic adults demonstrated atypical processes in both empathy and conflict resolution. Specifically, they exhibited heightened early emotional arousal but expended greater cognitive effort to evaluate others' pain. Autistic adults also showed increased alertness to unexpected sensory input and allocated more cognitive resources to resolve prediction errors from incongruent pairings. In contrast, neurotypical adults suppressed unnecessary cognitive efforts for meaningless errors. In summary, autistic adults may experience challenges in efficiently adjusting predictions to the external context, with their neural processing heavily depending on sensory input and less efficient in adapting cognitive resources to evaluate and respond to varied contextual demands.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

In W. chondrophila, both ndk paralogs retain conserved kinase motifs but differ in subcellular localization, suggesting divergent functional roles. WcNdk1 is confined to the inclusion and likely supports nucleotide metabolism, while WcNdk2 localizes to the host nucleus, perinuclear space, and Golgi apparatus, implying involvement in host interaction. Azidothymidine (AZT), a known Ndk inhibitor, was found to impair the growth of W. chondrophila, possibly by targeting WcNdk2 due to its role in host interaction.

We showed that the overexpression of GDF5 in the muscle improved its histology, reduced inflammation, modulated regeneration and induced the appearance of de novo fibers. We demonstrated that muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) are targeted by GDF5 which enhanced their proliferation and slowed down their myogenic commitment and finally their fusion.

This study aimed to determine the mechanical and morphological properties of HIV-1 virus-like particles with different envelopes. Three HIV-like particles, i.e. GagM + gp150, GagM + gp140HA2tr, and GagM + gp120HA2, were produced by combining the same Gag protein shell with different trimeric glycoprotein envelopes. The particles' spring constant, breaking force, and dimensions were determined using atomic force microscopy, and the elastic modulus was quantified using finite element analysis. Spring constant, elastic modulus, and breaking force were higher for GagM + gp140HA2tr and GagM + gp120HA2 than for GagM + gp150. The particle height was smaller for GagM + gp120HA2 than for GagM + gp150 and GagM + gp140HA2tr. Possible mechanisms underlying the increase of the particles' stiffness and mechanical strength are the inclusion of the influenza virus HA transmembrane domain in the HIV Env protein, and the lower expression and packing density of Env in GagM + gp140HA2tr and GagM + gp120HA2 compared to GagM + gp150 found previously.

S.", "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS), although rare, is the most common primary bone cancer, primarily affecting individuals aged 10-30 years. Despite therapeutic advances, survival rates have remained stagnant for decades. Recent studies show that Riluzole, a glutamate receptor antagonist, induces apoptosis in OS cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our previous work demonstrated that Riluzole increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating c-Abl kinase, which phosphorylates Yes-associated protein (Yap) at tyrosine 357. This modification promotes nuclear translocation of Yap and interaction with p73, enhancing Bax expression and inducing apoptosis. Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1), a zinc finger transcription factor often linked to apoptosis in other cancers, is significantly downregulated in OS. Here, we investigated the role of EGR1 in Riluzole-mediated apoptosis across OS cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). In this study, we show that Riluzole upregulates EGR1 expression in all OS cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR confirmed that EGR1 directly binds to the Bax promoter along with Yap/p73, enhancing Bax expression. Immunohistochemistry of in vivo xenograft tumors from Riluzole-treated mice revealed increased EGR1 and cleaved caspase-3 levels, indicating elevated apoptosis, while reduced NUMA expression suggested diminished tumor proliferation. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism where Riluzole promotes apoptosis through upregulation of EGR1, which then cooperates with YAP/p73 to activate Bax expression. These insights establish Riluzole as a promising therapeutic intervention for OS treatment through modulation of the EGR1/Yap/p73/Bax signaling axis.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Although the contribution of muscle wasting to weakness is well described, the role of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction in early disuse-related weakness is not well understood. Objective: We investigated whether short-term unilateral hindlimb immobilization (HLI) in rats impairs NMJ transmission and contributes to muscle weakness out of proportion to atrophy. Methods: Four-month-old male Fischer-344/Brown Norway rats underwent 10 days of unilateral HLI (n=6) or remained mobile (n=6). Neuromuscular excitability and transmission were assessed using compound muscle action potentials (CMAP), repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS), and single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG). Muscle contractility testing quantified tetanic torque, and post-mortem analysis measured muscle mass. Results: Ten days of HLI reduced gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscle mass by ~20 to 35%. Plantarflexion peak tetanic torque normalized to body weight declined by 23%, and torque-time integral was reduced by 36%, indicating disproportionate functional loss (muscle size versus contractile output) and supporting underlying neural impairment. CMAP amplitude decreased from 69 mV to 53.23 mV (a 22.9% reduction; p = 0.0109), indicating a loss of summated neuromuscular excitability. Furthermore, both RNS and SFEMG indicated features consistent with NMJ transmission defects. RNS revealed CMAP decrement from ~0% pre-HLI to -9.15% at 40 Hz stimulation and -8.63% at 50 Hz post-HLI. Similarly, SFEMG confirmed marked NMJ transmission defects, with jitter increasing 103% and blocking increased from <1% to >11% of fibers. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that short-term immobilization produces rapid and pronounced impairments in NMJ transmission that contribute to weakness beyond the degree of muscle atrophy. These findings identify the NMJ as an early and vulnerable site of disuse-induced dysfunction and highlight the potential for synaptic-targeted therapies to preserve muscle performance during immobilization and recovery.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

There has been broad development of computational and web-based tools for gRNA efficiency predictions but their performances in plant genome editing remains controversial or untested. Hence, in this study, we systematically evaluated over 20 accessible, web-based in silico gRNA on-target efficiency prediction tools using an experimental plant genome editing dataset. Excitingly, we identified multiple tools, mostly developed using machine learning, that were highly predictive of gRNA on-target genome editing efficiency in planta. The prediction scores assigned to gRNAs in the dataset by these tools were significantly correlated with the frequency of CRISPR-mediated InDels in plants. Furthermore, we evaluated efficiency prediction scores available on popular platforms such as CRISPOR and CRISPR-P which contain large numbers of non-model plant genomes. Our analysis showed that some prediction scores on CRISPOR performed quite well which allows efficient integration of on-target and off-target predictions.

The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe region, is a key orchestrator in the encoding and retrieval of memory and is believed to be one of the first regions to deteriorate in AD. In this work we examined hippocampal macrostructure (specifically gyrification and thickness) and microstructure in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relative to healthy aged controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We first utilized an iterative training paradigm to adapt an existing deep learning approach for capturing hippocampal topology to elderly individuals as well as individuals with potential hippocampal degeneration. Using this new model, we found notable decreases in both thickness and gyrification in AD and MCI across both the subfields and anterior-posterior axis. Using the diffusion tensor representation derived from diffusion MRI data, we found significant increases in the mean diffusivity across the extent of the hippocampus in AD and MCI, which may be related to a number of changes such as loss of neuronal cells, decreased fiber density, demyelination, and increased presence of CSF. Examining the primary direction of diffusion relative to canonical hippocampal axes, we found distinct diffusion orientation shifts in AD and MCI throughout the anterior-posterior extent of the subiculum and CA1. Specifically, we found a decrease in diffusion oriented tangentially, and an increase in diffusion oriented along the long-axis. This could potentially be related to the known degeneration of the perforant path, which is greatly affected in AD and is a largely tangential oriented pathway. The AD-related changes in diffusion orientations were found to not have significant spatial overlap with AD-related changes in mean diffusivity, suggesting that they may be capturing distinct spatially-localized disease processes. Finally, we showed that the macro- and microstructure of the hippocampus in AD changed less across age relative to MCI and controls. As well, the age-related hippocampal macrostructure changes in MCI appeared indistinguishable from healthy aging.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that conditional REST elevation in cerebellar granule cell progenitors (CGNPs) of RESTTG mice perturbed foliation, increased cell migration, and sustained C-X-C motif receptor 4 (Cxcr4) signaling, a pathway key to postnatal CGNP migration. Mechanistic studies uncovered a novel role for REST in controlling transcript diversity and exon skipping in CGNPs. Alternative transcript expression was detected in known Cxcr4 signaling regulator, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-6 (Grk6). Further analysis of Grk6 isoform expression revealed an upregulation of a transcript lacking exon 10a (Grk6-207) in RESTTG CGNPs. Grk6-207 expression in wildtype CGNPs hyperactivated Cxcr4 signaling and increased chemotaxis. Structural modeling of Grk6-207 predicted changes in active site conformation and interactions with Cxcr4 and {beta}-Arrestin-1, supporting impairment of Cxcr4 signaling desensitization. Interestingly, REST elevation promoted increased chromatin accessibility at the exon10a-10b junction and exon 10a exclusion. Integrated multiomic analyses identified the enhancer of zeste (Ezh2) as a potential mediator of alternative transcript generation which demonstrated increased occupancy at the exon10a-10b locus in RESTTG CGNPs. Pharmacological inhibition of Ezh2 downregulated Grk6-207, confirming a role for Ezh2 in Grk6 exon10a exclusion and the increased migration in RESTTG CGNPs.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

For bladder cancer patients, there is a unique opportunity to deliver TILs locally, through intravesical administration, without systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy to induce lymphodepletion. Improved selection of patients for ACT-TILs by predicting TIL expansion may prevent excessive treatment-related costs and delays in treatment of patients whose bladder cancer specimens would not yield successful TIL growth. In this study, we developed a machine-learning (ML) model optimized for local data of a medium size to determine a minimal robust feature combination (demographic, clinical, and biological tumor specimen-based) that is predictive of whether TILs can be expanded from a resected bladder cancer. The study uses a retrospectively identified set of data from bladder cancer patients at Moffitt Cancer Center that were assigned to internal training/testing or blinded validation cohorts. Using random forest method (RF) to identify a combination of robust predictive features, support vector machine (SVM) model to determine the optimal classification hyperparameters, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) method to adjust the decision-boundary threshold for imbalanced data, our model yielded AUC=0.771 for the internal testing cohort and AUC=0.828 for the blinded validation cohort. Thus, our ML model optimized for local data of medium size has favorable performance metrics for predicting TIL expansion from a given tumor. This computational predictor can serve as a clinical supportive tool to determine which patients are candidates for ACT-TILs.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

During a primary infection with Plasmodium, Tregs suppress protective immunity by inhibiting germinal center (GC) reactions, thereby impeding the control of parasitemia. In contrast, we demonstrate here that memory Tregs (mTregs) remaining after the clearance of initial Plasmodium infection acquire protective functions upon recall. Relying on longitudinal studies in humans and mice, we show that mTregs undergo antigen-driven expansion and inflammation-induced epigenetic reprogramming during reinfection to transition from Foxp3+ immunosuppressive cells to Bcl6+ follicular T helper (Tfh)-like effectors. These mTreg-derived Tfh-like cells enhance GC responses and the generation of Plasmodium-specific antibodies, ultimately facilitating Plasmodium control. Precluding such mTreg-to-Tfh differentiation abolished protection. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized adaptive plasticity in canonical mTregs that enables a context-dependent functional switch from immunoregulatory to protective effectors during recurrent infections.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

Sebum-based diagnostic methods using commercial oil-blotting films have been applied to SARS-CoV-2 detection in humans, yet equivalent strategies for veterinary use remain largely unexplored. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), presents a major health threat in Asia-especially in Japan, where multiple cases of cat-to-veterinarian transmission have been reported. To address the need for safer diagnostics, we sought to establish a sebum-based RNA virus detection method for cats. We designed primers that efficiently detected RNA from feline sebum while distinguishing it from human and feline DNA/RNA. Using this platform, we determined the ear to be the optimal sebum collection site and confirmed that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) RNA can be reliably identified from ear sebum with sensitivity comparable to conventional blood-based testing. In addition, we detected SFTSV RNA from sebum samples of infected cat.

To this end, ATG5 and ATG7 were selectively silenced in endothelial cells, with knockdown efficiency confirmed via RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses. Gene expression profiling revealed differential regulation of TGF-{beta} signalling components following ATG5 or ATG7 silencing. Functional assays demonstrated that ATG5 knockdown enhanced endothelial cell proliferation and migration, whereas ATG7 silencing produced distinct, less pronounced effects. Furthermore, downstream effectors of the TGF-{beta} pathway exhibited gene-specific modulation, underscoring divergent roles of ATG5 and ATG7 in this signalling cascade.

This knowledge gap, combined with the lack of robust allometric equations, limits the development of reliable Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) protocols for plantations. Since accurate estimates of tree volume and aboveground biomass (AGB) are essential for carbon stock assessment and for implementing climate change mitigation strategies such as REDD+, this study developed allometric equations for tree volume and AGB in A. mangium plantations on the Bateke Plateau, Republic of Congo, using destructive sampling of 54 trees (4-24 cm DBH; 25, 42, and 66 months old). Trees were measured, felled, and partitioned into trunks and large branches (>4 cm), small branches (1-4 cm), foliage, and stumps. Samples of each compartment were oven-dried and weighed. Results showed that AGB allocation to trunks and large branches increased with age, while allocation to small branches declined. A power-law model (Y = a(D2H)?) provided the best fits for both volume (Y= 0.401(D2H)0{middle dot}984) and AGB (Y = 0.259(D2H)0{middle dot}900).

The effects of landscape composition and configuration on the diversity, presence, and activity of different bat species were evaluated for each plot type at yearly, seasonal, and monthly scales. All seven bat species studied were less active in the solar fields compared to the two grassland controls. Specifically, both the number of nights that bats were present and the activity of bats were reduced in solar fields.

Given these multi-scale evolutionary forces, genetic variation and diversity are expected to be hierarchically structured. Characterising hierarchical population structure is crucial to understanding a species' evolutionary history and informing effective conservation and management strategies. In this study, we analysed genomic diversity and variation in woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) across western Canada using genotypes from ~33,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) loci from 759 geo-referenced individuals spanning 45 pre-defined subpopulations. We employed genetic clustering methods and measures of genetic differentiation to characterize hierarchical population structure in the region and tested for latitudinal changes in heterozygosity resulting from post-glacial recolonisation and hybridisation. Our results confirm that woodland caribou genetic diversity and differentiation occur at multiple hierarchical levels, reflecting post-glacial recolonisation patterns and landscape heterogeneity. Notably, the major genetic clusters identified in our study do not align with current conservation units for the species in this region. We also observe elevated heterozygosity in the mid-latitudes of the sampled range, indicative of hybridisation following secondary contact during post-glacial recolonisation. These findings underscore the need to consider and include genetic diversity at all hierarchical levels in conservation planning, as wide-ranging species often experience diverse and complex evolutionary histories and pressures.", "date": "2025-10-15", "journal": ""}

We examined the top-down effects of stickleback on phenotypic change in Daphnia over three years in lakes that naturally contained sticklebacks and compared such trends with the experimental lakes. We observed consistent phenotypic differences between lakes with naturally occurring populations of benthic vs. limnetic stickleback.

One of the biallelic mutations, c.740+356C>T, causes inclusion of cryptic exon(s) containing premature termination codons, while c.740+301G>A has not been characterized. We hypothesized that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) complementary to the patient's mutations or to the cryptic exon splice sites would correct the splicing of SDCCAG8 between exons 7 and 8 to prevent cryptic exon inclusion and restore SDCCAG8 expression. We systematically screened 20nt-long ASOs tiled across each mutation and ASOs targeting the 3' splice sites of the cryptic exons in patient-derived fibroblasts, using RT-PCR assays to assess exon 7 and 8 splicing. We identified one ASO for each mutation and a cryptic exon-targeting ASO that restored the splicing pattern to that observed in an unaffected cell line. Lead ASOs were further investigated through RT-PCR, RNA sequencing, and western blotting to confirm ASO-mediated restoration of wild-type transcript and protein. Notably, ASO 20, which targets the cryptic exon 7a/7a' splice site rather than patient-specific mutations, achieved the greatest rescue effect, increasing exon 7-8 splicing from 0% to an average of 26% and restoring SDCCAG8 protein from undetectable levels to approximately 40% of wild-type expression.

Notably, the gene body mark H3K36me3 is enriched in introns, which appears to be distinct in plants. Finally, we tested these relationships by comparing recent gene duplicates with diverged intron architectures, and confirmed that intron number is positively associated with H3K4me1, H3K36me3, H2A.X, meCG, and broad expression across tissues. Our results suggest two distinct mechanisms in which plant intron architecture may affect chromatin states and ultimately gene expression, motivating future experiments.

PIMREG is a marker of proliferation highly expressed across different tumor types, with particularly elevated levels in GBM. Our previous study revealed that PIMREG silencing sensitizes GBM cells to TMZ treatment and affects ATM activation, a key apical kinase involved in DNA damage signaling. Given the emerging significance of PIMREG in DNA damage response, we sought to explore its role in DNA damage repair and signaling in GBM cells exposed to genotoxic agents. Here we assessed the functionally enriched pathways associated with high PIMREG expression in GBM patient samples, analyzed the interactome of PIMREG upon treatment of GBM cells with TMZ and evaluated the impact of PIMREG on DNA damage signaling alongside its function in the repair of double-strand breaks. Our findings reveal that PIMREG functions as a direct substrate for ATM/ATR kinases, interacts with key DNA repair proteins upon TMZ treatment and actively facilitates the cellular response to chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced DNA damage.
