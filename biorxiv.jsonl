However, their form and inflexibility often restrict potential experimental paradigms that involve multiple or adaptive maze designs. Unique layouts often lead to elevated costs, whether financially or in terms of time investment from scientists. To alleviate these issues, we have developed an automated, modular maze system that is flexible and scalable. This open source Adapt-A-Maze (AAM) system will allow for experiments with multiple track configurations in rapid succession. Additionally, the flexibility can expedite prototyping of behavioral paradigms. Automation ensures less variability in experimental parameters and higher throughput. Finally, the standardized componentry enhances experimental repeatability within labs and replicability across labs. Our maze was successfully used across labs, in multiple experimental designs, with and without extracellular or optical recordings, in rats. The AAM system presents multiple advantages over current maze options and can facilitate novel behavior and systems neuroscience research.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Characterizing the microbial functional guilds driving these processes is crucial for understanding ecosystem functioning and predicting their responses to environmental changes. Standard sequence-based characterization methods often reveal only a limited fraction of their diversity in nature because of their low relative abundance, the insufficient sequencing depth of traditional metagenomes of complex communities, and limitations in coverage of PCR-based assays. Here, we developed and tested a targeted metagenomics approach based on probe capture and hybridization to simultaneously characterize the diversity of multiple key metabolic genes involved in inorganic N and CH4 cycling. We designed comprehensive probe libraries for each of the 14 target marker genes comprising 264,000 unique probes. These probes were used to selectively enrich the target genes in shotgun metagenomic libraries. In validation experiments with the mock communities of known microorganisms, targeted metagenomics yielded gene profiles similar to those of the original communities. Only GC content had a small effect on probe efficiency, as low GC targets were less efficiently detected than those with high GC, within the mock communities. Furthermore, the relative abundances of the marker genes obtained using targeted or traditional shotgun metagenomics from agricultural and wetland soils were significantly correlated, indicating that the targeted approach did not introduce significant quantitative bias. In addition, using archaeal amoA genes as a case-study, targeted metagenomics identified substantially higher taxonomic diversity and a larger number of sequence reads per sample, yielding diversity estimates 28 or 1.24 times higher than shotgun metagenomics or amplicon sequencing, respectively. Notably, shotgun metagenomics detected only three out of the 84 amoA gene phylotypes detected using targeted metagenomics. Our results show that targeted metagenomics complements current approaches to characterize key microbial populations and functional guilds in biogeochemical cycles in different ecosystems, enabling more detailed, simultaneous characterization of multiple functional genes.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

In cyanobacteria, glycogen degradation is crucial for metabolic transitions during dark phases or during resuscitation from nitrogen starvation. Like many other cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 possesses multiple homologues of glycogen catabolizing enzymes, though their specific roles and regulatory mechanisms are only partially understood. Here we demonstrate through biochemical analysis that the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP1, known to promote high temperature acclimation, is uniquely regulated by a C-terminal redox switch found certain cyanobacteria. This is the first evidence of redox regulation of a prokaryotic glycogen degrading enzyme. Notably, GlgP1 is activated via oxidation by reactive oxygen species and inactivated by reducing agents, with thioredoxin being the most effective inhibitor tested. The physiological implications of this redox regulation are discussed. Additionally, a biochemically characterization of the two glycogen debranching isoenzymes GlgX1 and GlgX2 revealed that only GlgX1 exhibits debranching activity, while GlgX2 does not. Mutant analysis confirmed that GlgX1 plays an essential role in glycogen mobilization, being crucial for resuscitation from chlorosis and survival during extended dark periods.

The ability to detect a regime shift, such as the onset of a pandemic or the end of a recession, significantly impacts individual decisions as well as governmental policies. However, determining whether a regime has changed is usually not obvious, as signals are noisy and reflective of the volatility of the environment. We designed an fMRI paradigm that examines a stylized regime-shift detection task. Human participants showed systematic over- and underreaction: Overreaction was most commonly seen when signals were noisy but when environments were stable and change is possible but unlikely. By contrast, underreaction was observed when signals were precise but when environments were unstable and hence change was more likely. These behavioral signatures are consistent with the system-neglect computational hypothesis, which posits that sensitivity or lack thereof to system parameters (noise and volatility) is central to these behavioral biases. Guided by this computational framework, we found that individual subjects' sensitivity to system parameters were represented by two distinct brain networks. Whereas a frontoparietal network selectively represented individuals' sensitivity to signal noise but not environment volatility, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed the opposite pattern. Further, these two networks were involved in different aspects of regime-shift computations: while vmPFC correlated with subjects' beliefs about change, the frontoparietal network represented the strength of evidence in favor of regime shifts. Together, these results suggest that regime-shift detection recruits belief-updating and evidence-evaluation networks and that under- and overreactions arise from how sensitive these networks are to the system parameters.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Utilising a wide range of population genetics methods, including an enhanced protocol to detect identity-by-descent (IBD) segments between ancient and present-day individuals, we reveal that present-day Albanians predominantly descend from Albania's Early Medieval inhabitants, who were present in Albania as early as 800-900 CE, preceding their historical attestation.

Previously, we have shown two serotype 6B S. pneumoniae mutant strains affecting bacterial metabolism ({triangleup}proABC/pia and{triangleup} fhs/pia) colonise humans and mice, but in a murine disease model do not cause invasive infection. Here, we explore whether S. pneumoniae epithelial microinvasion and the induction of innate immune responses persist despite disease attenuation. We show that under serum stress, these biosynthesis gene mutations had a broad but different impact on pneumococcal virulence gene expression, oxidative stress regulation, and purine and carbohydrate metabolism genes. However, although these mutations did not attenuate microinvasion in human challenge and epithelial models, there was less transmigration of Detroit 562 nasopharyngeal epithelial cells by the mutants compared to WT. Cellular reorganisation of primary human airway epithelium varied considerably between strains. Compared to WT, infection of Detroit 562 epithelial cells by the{triangleup} fhs/piaA strain, but not the{triangleup} proABC/piaA strain was less pro-inflammatory, induced less caspase 8 production, and were associated with increased pneumococcal hydrogen peroxide and reduced pneumolysin secretion. These findings suggest that the observed differences in microinvasion and the epithelial response were driven by the differential expression of multiple bacterial virulence and metabolic pathways, rather than single genes or pathways of genes. These data highlight the complex impact of single gene mutations on bacterial virulence and suggest that the virulence determinants of pneumococcal epithelial colonisation, microinvasion and innate immunity are not necessarily directly linked to disease.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Yet in certain settings, despite object properties remaining constant and intention the same, the grasp chosen by an individual can vary with a lack of clear preference for a particular grasp configuration. This is referred to as motor ambiguity. Here, we compare the influence of preceding static versus dynamic visual information on participants' choice between two possible hand configurations when grasping an object at various orientations. We confirm previous findings that presentation of an object in an initial static orientation prior to the grasping in ambiguous orientation causes subjects to select a grasp that would be most congruent with the initial, determinate orientation. However, we unexpectedly found that when object rotation is observed between the initial and target positions, the bias is inversed, i.e. subjects choose the alternate grasp configurations. Furthermore, the inverse bias strength was found to be independent of the motion magnitude, and persists even when greater decision time is allowed. We provide evidence that this bias effect is not a perceptual phenomenon, and suggest it is potentially a behavioural manifestation of inhibitory circuits that delay decisions in conditions of motor ambiguity.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

In this study, twelve healthy participants performed a protocol combining surface electromyography (EMG), robot-evoked wrist perturbations, and single pulse TMS applied to the motor cortex to study the effect of TMS intensity on the LLR amplitude in the flexor carpi radialis. We tested two TMS intensities of subthreshold (90%) and suprathreshold (130%) of the active motor threshold applied such that the motor evoked potential (MEP) peak would arrive 50 ms prior to perturbation onset. In suprathreshold TMS trials, TMS significantly reduced the cortical contribution to a LLR when applied prior to perturbation onset. When comparing the effects measured in the presence and absence of robot-applied muscle stretch, we observed that only suprathreshold conditions achieved inhibition of LLR, while subthreshold conditions did not result in any inhibition.

E.; Ford, A. T.; Germain, R.

The degree to which the environment is modified by consumers depends on species' traits, including body mass, movement and foraging behavior, and habitat specialization. Global change is altering the size and traits of consumer populations, but our understanding of how this may impact resource heterogeneity is limited. Here, we developed an individual-based model of habitat specialists' and generalists' movement and activity in a patchy landscape and investigated the impact of changes in population and mean body sizes on landscape-scale resource heterogeneity. We found that consumers specializing on low-resource habitats (a common risk avoidance strategy) increased spatial resource heterogeneity regardless of their population and body size. By contrast, generalists eroded differences among habitats, and we further found that resource heterogeneity decreased with the average body size of generalist consumers, even while controlling for total consumer biomass. Larger perceptual ranges increased the area over which generalist consumers could select foraging habitat, and reduced the extent to which they eroded landscape structure. These nuanced spatial outcomes of consumer-resource interactions emerge from how metabolic demands, which scale nonlinearly with body size, play out among habitat types which attract different consumers, as well as the scale at which those consumers make habitat selection decisions. Since global change disproportionately impacts larger species and specialists, indirect consequences on ecosystems may arise via biotic processes, affecting spatial heterogeneity of future landscapes.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

An emerging factor in this regenerative process is the bi-directional interplay between microtubule dynamics and the delicate morphology of the axonal endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, we hypothesize that locally synthesized ER structural proteins regulate microtubule dynamics and the regenerative response of cortical axons. This hypothesis is supported by RNA data-mining, which identified Reticulon-1 as the sole mRNA coding for an ER-shaping protein across eight axonal transcriptomes and found it to be downregulated following injury. Using compartmentalized microfluidic chambers, we demonstrate that local knockdown of Reticulon-1 mRNA increases the outgrowth while reducing the distal tubulin levels of injured axons. Furthermore, we show by live-cell imaging that axonal Reticulon-1 knockdown restores the loss of microtubule growth speed and length caused by injury. Interestingly, axonal inhibition of the microtubule-severing protein Spastin fully prevents the effects of axonal Reticulon-1 knockdown on outgrowth as well as distal tubulin levels, while not affecting most of the analyzed microtubule dynamic parameters. Further, we demonstrate that the Reticulon-1C isoform is locally synthesized within axons and provide evidence supporting that it attenuates Spastin-mediated microtubule severing.

While various aspects of the brain have been implicated in modulating social behavior, critical regulators include cells of the preoptic area (POA) and hypothalamus, which by applying cellular-resolution transcriptomic approaches allows for greater exploration of cellular dynamics in these cells. Yet, how complex gene networks function between and within cell types to regulate complex social behavior is still poorly understood. Importantly, when considering functionally relevant neuronal classes of genes such as neuropeptides, understanding the inherent complexity that emerges from the interaction of these genes in the transcriptomic neuropeptidome can provide unique insight into how social behavior is regulated. Here, we used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing in the hypothalamus and POA of a highly social cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, to understand the effect that social status has on cellular-level transcriptomic profiles. Males of this species are well known for their highly plastic phenotypes related to social status, which allows for a hypothesis-driven approach. We demonstrate how social status manifests in changes of gene co-expression networks across neuronal populations and highlight transcriptomic signatures of social dominance when targeting known functional differences among AVP neuronal cell types.

A common approach to analyze such data is to model observed allele counts in finite samples using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) where hidden states are true allele frequencies over time (i.e. a trajectory). The HMM framework allows to compute the full likelihood of the data, while accounting both for the stochastic evolution of population allele frequencies along time and for the noise arising from sampling a limited number of individuals at possibly spread out generations. Several such HMM methods have been proposed so far, differing mainly in the way they model the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. Following Paris et al.

Additionally, an often co-occurring consequence of differing event durations is a variable overlap of the responses to subsequent events. While the problem of overlap e.g. in fMRI and EEG is successfully addressed using linear deconvolution, it is unclear whether deconvolution and duration covariate modeling can be jointly used, as both are dependent on the same inter-event-distance variability. Here, we first show that failing to explicitly account for event durations can lead to spurious results and thus are important to consider. Next, we propose and compare several methods based on multiple regression to explicitly account for stimulus durations. Using simulations, we find that non-linear spline regression of the duration effect outperforms other candidate approaches. Finally, we show that non-linear event duration modeling is compatible with linear overlap correction in time, making it a flexible and appropriate tool to model overlapping brain signals. This allows us to reconcile the analysis of stimulus responses with e.g. condition-biased reaction times, condition-biased stimulus duration, or fixation-related activity with condition-biased fixation durations.

To address this, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) similarity network analysis to study the effects of stress in the rat, an important animal model in neuropsychiatry. We measured magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) at each of 53 distinct cortical areas and estimated a cortical similarity network for each individual scan, in two independent experimental datasets. We first characterized normative network development in rats scanned repeatedly between postnatal days 20 (weanling) and 290 (mid-adulthood) (N=47), and then contrasted these findings with a cohort exposed to early life stress in the form of repeated maternal separation (RMS, N=40). The normative rat cortical similarity network exhibited biologically meaningful organization, aligning with prior cytoarchitectonic and tract-tracing data, and displayed complex topological features, including rich club organization. During postnatal and adolescent development, brain regions became more similar, including an early phase of fronto-hippocampal convergence. Early increases in inter-areal similarity were reversed in a later phase of fronto-hippocampal divergence in mid-adulthood. RMS exposure altered inter-areal similarity, especially between frontal and parahippocampal regions, that were also most active developmentally and in aging. Our results reveal how normative cortical network changes in the developing brain are influenced by early life stress. These findings suggest a new translational framework for elucidating how environmental risk factors lead to atypical development of cortical networks.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses. Our results indicate that retinas with severely altered morphology still retain some capacity to process light stimuli.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Contact with microenvironment facilitates survival, proliferation and resistance to treatment of CLL cells. Here, we studied the interaction between CLL cells and nurse-like cells (NLCs), a subtype of macrophages heavily implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease. Using in vitro cultures of human primary cells, we demonstrated that NLCs express high levels of folate receptor beta (FOLR2), which correlates with survival of CLL cells. Next, we discovered that CLL cells acquire functional FOLR2 from the NLCs through trogocytosis, thereby increasing their uptake of folates. Treatment of CLL and NLC co-cultures with IL-15 and CD40L, to mimic TME, substantially increases the frequency of FOLR2+ CLL cells, which are significantly enriched in activated and proliferating fraction of the cells, particularly under folic acid depletion. With multi-immunofluorescence analysis of CLL patients lymph nodes, we confirmed the presence of FOLR2+ NLCs, whose frequency correlates with increased proliferation of cancer cells. Further detection of FOLR2+ CLL cells, provided evidence of trogocytosis in vivo. Finally, based on CD163/FOLR2 co-staining and spatial distribution of NLCs we uncovered heterogenous subpopulations of these cells suggesting their various specialization. This work proposes trogocytosis as an important mechanism of NLC-dependent support of CLL cells, and underscore FOLR2 as a new marker of NLCs.

In macrophages, this balance is especially important, given their central role in host defense, pathogenesis and wound healing. Here, we present a time resolved model of sphingolipid metabolism in RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with KdO2 Lipid A. By integrating measured metabolite concentrations with dynamic flux estimation and established enzyme kinetics, we systematically map dynamic changes in the sphingolipid network during inflammation. Our results reveal a three phase pattern of sphingolipid remodeling that correlates with distinct functional states of the cell. Moreover, metabolites can be classified into resolving or non resolving lipids based on whether they return to basal levels or remain dysregulated through the later phases of the inflammatory response. This partitioning suggests that targeted modulation of specific metabolic nodes may influence the resolution of inflammation. Importantly, our computational approach can assist in the rational design of experimental studies by pinpointing putative drug targets with maximal impact on sphingolipid homeostasis. Such targeted interventions may prevent the pathological amplification of inflammatory signals without globally suppressing essential sphingolipid functions. These findings highlight the utility of an integrative systems level analysis for elucidating sphingolipid dynamics in macrophages and underscore its potential to guide therapeutic strategies against conditions involving dysregulated inflammation", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

The MICOS complex is among the inducers of sharp membrane curvature needed for crista formation. Resembling the respiratory chain complexes, MICOS is organized around a core protein, the mitofilin-domain bearing Mic60, that was inherited from the alphaproteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria. Extant alphaproteobacteria express Mic60 to form their own bioenergetic subcompartments, demonstrating the permeance of Mic60's form and function during the long span of prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution. Yet, unlike virtually all aerobic eukaryotes, Mic60 is not encoded in any genome of the multifarious protists that comprise the phylum Euglenozoa, including trypanosomes. Here, we show that Mic60 has been replaced in euglenozoans by two cryptic mitofilin domain-containing MICOS subunits, Mic34 and Mic40. Sharply contrasting Mic60 from two domains of life, these are not integral membrane proteins. Reverse genetics revealed they are intertwined with the oxidative protein folding pathway required for mitochondrial-and crista-biogenesis, veiling a potential membrane remodeling role. Nevertheless, Mic34 binds to phospholipid bilayers in vitro. Mic34 and Mic40 heterologous expression remodels gammaproteobacterial cytoplasmic membranes, like prokaryotic and eukaryotic Mic60. Astoundingly, Mic34 overexpression elaborates the simplified tubular mitochondrion of a Trypanosoma brucei life cycle stage with repressed oxidative phosphorylation. The structural correspondence of Mic34's mitofilin domain to Mic60's predicted mutations to conserved motifs that ablated Mic34's mitochondria-remodeling activity. Thus, the mitofilin protein family is more diverse than originally supposed, with two of its structurally most divergent members altering the core of euglenozoan MICOS.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are hippocampal network oscillations associated with memory consolidation. They are characterized by the co-occurrence of fast and slow field potentials across CA1 layers: the fast-frequency oscillations, known as ripples, are prominent in the pyramidal cell layer, where they coincide with increased neuronal spiking, while slower negative transients, referred to as sharp waves, occur simultaneously in the stratum radiatum. SWRs have traditionally been considered globally synchronous across the hippocampus; however, recent evidence suggests that ripples may be less synchronous than previously thought, particularly between the two hemispheres (Villalobos et al., 2017). In this study, we revisited this question using a unique dataset from probes spanning the septo-temporal axis of CA1. Our results demonstrate that ripples are phase-locked within but not between hemispheres, although their occurrence remains time-locked across both the septo-temporal axis and hemispheres. We also observed similar synchronicity pattern for spiking activity: neurons are locally phase-coupled and globally time-coupled to ripple events. Interneurons exhibit a much stronger phase coupling to both ipsilateral and contralateral ripples than pyramidal neurons. These findings suggest that ripples are locally phase-coupled through pyramidal-interneuron interactions, with global time-locking likely driven by a common bilateral CA3 input and potentially modulated by interneuron circuits.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Using this model, we evaluated heat-shock proteins (Hsp), which have been linked to tau pathology, but whose role in AD remains enigmatic and controversial. In primary neurons, expression of Hsp70, but not Hsc70 or Hsp90, exacerbated tau aggregation. Conversely, lowering Hsp70 or employing a chaperone-deficient tau mutant (PL-SF-4 delta;) reduced tau phosphorylation and abrogated tau aggregation, highlighting Hsp70 as a key driver of tau aggregation. Hsp70 foci clustered within and surrounding neuritic plaques and NFTs in post-mortem AD brain. Functionally, mature aggregate-bearing neurons showed deficits in neuronal firing and network communication, which were restored by chaperone-binding deficient tau variants that abrogated tau pathology.

It is linked to genetic mutations in the serine/threonine kinase TLK2, characterised by haploinsufficiency and in some cases, its loss or impaired kinase function. TLK2 is an established cell cycle regulator that has been extensively studied in mitotic cells. It is upregulated in cancers, driving tumour growth, however, the role of TLK2 in postmitotic neurons is not understood. We therefore aimed to gain insight into how TLK2 mutations cause MRD57 by determining where TLK2 is expressed in the brain and its subcellular localisation during neuronal differentiation. Public human and mouse brain transcriptomic data revealed splice variant diversity in the N-terminus of TLK2, which contains its nuclear localisation sequence (NLS). Using splice-specific in situ hybridisation probes, we observed expression of TLK2 isoforms that contain and lack the NLS in the mouse hippocampus and cerebellum. We confirmed these findings in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and found that neuronal differentiation of these cells enhances a cytoplasmic pool of TLK2 by two mechanisms: nuclear export of full length TLK2 and increased expression of TLK2 splice variants lacking the NLS. Finally, acute stimuli that mimic synaptic activity were sufficient to elicit nuclear export of TLK2. Our data highlight the need to establish the neuronal cytoplasmic substrates of TLK2 and determine how the loss of TLK2 activity in MRD57 might impact their function in the developing and mature brain.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

However, no software currently exists that fully integrates the derivation and validation of state-specific and contrastive molecular diagnoses. Here we introduce UITOTO which addresses this gap and facilitates the identification, testing, and visualization of Diagnostic Molecular Combinations (DMCs). The software uses a weighted random sampling algorithm based on the Jaccard Index for building candidate DMCs. It then selects DMCs with the highest specificity stability, meeting user-defined thresholds for exclusive character states. If multiple optimal DMCs are identified, UITOTO derives a majority-consensus DMC. To verify whether the newly generated DMCs are contrastive, UITOTO includes a validation module that tests DMCs against database sequences, efficiently handling up to hundreds of thousands of aligned or unaligned sequences. In this manuscript we propose and assess UITOTO's performance with DMCs obtained from other software (e.g., MOLD) for three large empirical datasets: i) Megaselia (Diptera: Phoridae: 69 species, 2,229 training and 30,289 testing barcodes); ii) Mycetophilidae, (Diptera: 118 species, 1,456 training and 60,349 testing barcodes); and iii) European Lepidoptera (49 species, 591 training and 21,483 testing barcodes). Based on several classification metrics (e.g., Accuracy, F1 Score), UITOTO's DMCs outcompete DMCs obtained with other software. We furthermore provide guidelines for generating molecular diagnoses and facilitate obtaining DMCs by providing a user-friendly Shiny App GUI and a module for obtaining publication-quality DMC visualizations in RStudio. Overall, our study confirms that the biggest challenge for generating molecular and morphological diagnoses is similar, i.e., balancing specificity and length.

Furthermore, the effect of liveness on phase-locking was linked to increases in pleasure and engagement for live over recorded trials. Control analyses confirmed that the effects of liveness on phase-locking were not explained by low-level acoustic differences between performances.

However, existing differential gene expression (DGE) testing methods do not differentiate between these mechanisms, conflating all expression changes, limiting biological interpretability and obscuring key genes involved in tumor progression. To address this, we developed DeConveil, a computational framework that extends traditional DGE analysis by integrating CNV data. Using a generalized linear model with a negative binomial distribution, DeConveil models RNA-seq expression counts while accounting for copy number gene dosage effects. We proposed a more fine-grained gene decomposition into dosage-sensitive (DSGs), dosage-insensitive (DIGs), and dosage-compensated (DCGs), which explicitly de-couples changes due to CNVs and bona fide changes in transcriptional regulation. Analysis of TCGA datasets from aneuploid solid cancers resulted in notable reclassification of genes, refining and expanding upon the results from conventional methods. Functional enrichment analysis identified distinct biological roles for DSGs, DIGs, and DCGs in tumor progression, immune regulation, and cell adhesion. In a breast cancer case study, DeConveil's CN-aware analysis facilitated the identification of both known and novel prognostic biomarkers, including long non-coding RNAs, linking gene expression signatures to survival outcomes. Utilizing these biomarkers for each gene group significantly improved patient risk stratification, yielding more accurate predictions compared to conventional methods.

Prior work has determined that these DMVs have characteristic pores formed from the non-structural viral proteins nsp3 and nsp4, which facilitate export of newly synthesized viral RNA. Yet how the replication machinery, which is comprised of the non-structural proteins nsp7 to nsp16, is recruited to the DMV remains a mystery. Working from AlphaFold and previously determined structures, we constructed a series of models that link formation of the DMV pore to nsp5 protease processing of the polyprotein and trapping of the cleaved products within the DMV itself. We argue that the initial pore is formed from twelve subunits of nsp3 and six subunits each of the intermediate uncleaved polyproteins pp1a (nsp4-nsp10) and pp1ab (nsp4-nsp16). Formation of this initial structure activates the protease function of alternating nsp5 subunits within a close-packed ring, facilitating the initial trans-cleavage of the nsp4-nsp5 linkage. Maturation of the pore follows, as does formation of canonical nsp5 dimers, which can process the remainder of the polyproteins. When protease activation occurs subsequent to closure of the DMV, the cleavage products, whose stoichiometry is consistent with the previously proposed nsp15-centered hexameric replication complex, will be trapped inside.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Further, for rare non-parasitic species, eDNA methods exhibited similar sensitivity relative to traditional netting. Relative to flower eDNA samples, sequenced field negative controls resulted in significantly lower rates of Bombus detection, and these detections were likely attributable to high rates of background eDNA on environmental surfaces. Lastly, we found that eDNA-based frequency of detection across replicate surveys was strongly associated with net-based measures of abundance across site visits. We conclude that the method is cost-effective and highly scalable for semi-quantitative characterization of at-risk bumble bee communities, providing a new approach for improving our understanding of species habitat associations.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "In signaling cascades, where domain-motif interactions tend to interact with relatively low affinity (allowing for reversibility), signaling proteins often encode multiple domains or motifs, which present the possibility of avidity -- drastically increasing the interaction strength and duration as a result of multivalent binding. However, given the large combinatorial space, predicting and validating multivalent interactions that interact with avidity is a challenge. Here, we integrate mechanistic modeling, structure-based analysis, and experimental approaches as a framework for defining the conditions under which avidity plays a role. We explore the tandem SH2 domain family of interactions with bisphosphorylated partners as a multivalent archetype, which encompasses key secondary messengers in tyrosine kinase signaling networks. While certain multivalent interactions have been shown to be necessary in immune receptor recruitment of partners, bivalent recruitment of tandem SH2 domains more broadly is poorly understood. Theoretical modeling suggests that maximum avidity occurs with closely spaced or flexibly linked phosphotyrosine sites, combined with moderate monovalent affinities -- exactly around the innate range of SH2 domain affinity. Surprisingly, despite sequence diversity, structure-based analysis showed remarkably conserved three-dimensional spacing between SH2 domains across all tandem SH2 families, which we corroborate experimentally, suggesting evolutionary optimization for avidity interactions. The combination of structure-based analysis of domain spacing with available monovalent experimental data appears to be sufficiently accurate to predict and rank order high affinity interactions of tandem SH2 domain recruitment to the EGFR C-terminal tail. These approaches lay the groundwork for larger utility in multivalent prediction and testing to help better understand protein interactions that drive cell signaling.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Estimating VA typically involves obtaining suitable measures of fitness on a large number of individuals with known pairwise relatedness. Such data are hard to collect and the results are often sensitive to the definition of fitness used. Here, we present a new method for estimating VA that does not involve making measurements of fitness on individuals, but instead tracks changes in the genetic composition of the population. First, we show that VA can readily be expressed as a function of the genome-wide diversity/linkage disequilibrium matrix and genome-wide expected change in allele frequency due to selection. We then show how independent experimental replicates can be used to infer the expected change in allele frequency due to selection and then estimate VA via a linear mixed model. Finally, using individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that our approach yields precise and accurate estimates over a range of biologically plausible scenarios.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Recently, a laboratory-selected Spodoptera frugiperda strain exhibited a high level of resistance to Vip3Aa (resistance ratio: 5562-fold), with the mutation of the chitin synthase gene, SfCHS2, identified as a key factor. In this study, we extend these findings to additional lepidopteran species, including Spodoptera exigua and Agrotis ipsilon. Our results show that CHS2 knockout strains lack the peritrophic matrix (PM), while the resistant Sfru_R3 strain retains its PM. Knockout of this gene resulted in high levels resistance to Vip3Aa. These findings further validate the role of the CHS2 gene in Vip3Aa resistance and highlight its potential as a target for resistance management in lepidopteran pests.

To overcome this limitation, we implemented an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, along with a biological function database, within MiCId workflow. Using synthetic datasets, our study demonstrates that the enhanced MiCId workflow achieves better control over false discoveries and improved accuracy in microorganism identification and biomass estimation compared to Unipept and MetaGOmics. Additionally, the updated MiCId offers improved accuracy and better control of false discoveries in biological function identification compared to Unipept, along with reliable computation of function abundances across the full taxonomic lineage of identified microorganisms.

However, this reductionist view offers only a partial picture; the emergence of life likely involved networks of molecular interactions that collectively shaped early functional assemblies. In this study, we examine the potential of peptides - arguably one of the most abundant early polymers - to interact with mineral surfaces and lipid vesicles, prebiotic interfaces and compartments. Focusing on peptide compositions derived from prebiotically plausible amino acids, we demonstrate that early peptides could bind to mineral surfaces (such as fluorapatite studied here) via negatively charged residues and contribute to the release of bioavailable phosphate from geological reservoirs. Nevertheless, the recruitment of amino acids from the modern alphabet was likely adaptive for favourable interactions with lipid vesicles, leading to enhanced vesicle growth and stability. Our findings suggest that while early random peptides could contribute to functionality at geochemical interfaces, the evolving complexity of the peptide/protein alphabet was likely a key factor in the evolution of protocells.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

It is the building block of capsids that protect the genome of viruses in the Duplodnaviria realm, infecting organisms across all domains of life. It is also the building block of encapsulins, compartments that confine biochemical reactions in prokaryotes. Recent genomic studies have hypothesized that encapsulins evolved from HK97-fold viruses. However, this evolutionary pathway is challenging to justify biophysically because HK97-fold viruses form larger and more complex protein shells than encapsulins. We addressed this paradox by searching for smaller and simpler HK97-fold viral capsids across ecosystems. The investigation yielded a well-defined group of viral entities, which encode HK97-fold proteins displaying molecular similarities with encapsulins and lacking portal and tail genes. The structural phylogenetic analysis of HK97-fold entities revealed bidirectional evolutionary transitions between encapsulins and HK97-fold viruses. An evolutionary mechanism responsible for such transitions was proposed based on the presence of lysogeny-associated genes in the viral entities and the structural and molecular parallels between encapsulins and procapsids, the immature state of viral capsids before genome packaging. We concluded that procapsids are akin to the common HK97-fold protein shell ancestor and might still facilitate transitions between modern viruses and encapsulins. The potential genomic and biochemical functions of HK97-fold procapsids make them an ideal candidate model for the early evolution of life and might require a revision of the role of viral capsids in the biosphere.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

We aimed to examine the relationship between uncertainty, pain learning and perception using hierarchical Bayesian modeling. In an aversive learning task, fifty participants learned contingencies between auditory cues and painful stimulations under changing levels of uncertainty, to create periods of stability and volatility. Model-free analysis of our data suggested unexpected trials resulted in reduced accuracy and greater response times. In unexpected trials, high pain perception was reduced, while low pain perception was increased, in line with documented effects of expectations on pain perception. Computational model fitting revealed participants learning was best described by a two-level hierarchical gaussian filter model, suggesting participants adapted their beliefs at multiple levels during the task. Uncertainty influenced pain perception in opposite patterns for high and low pain stimulations : high pain perception was greater under high levels of uncertainty while there was a non-significant trend for low pain perception to be reduced. Analyses of individual differences suggested depressive symptoms were associated with a reduced learning rate throughout the task. These results shed light on processes involved in pain learning in changing environments.

L.", "abstract": "Background: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder which is multifactorial in nature. Some of its characteristics are slow cognitive decline, memory problems and behavioral changes. AD patient brains show a progressive synaptic toxicity, autophagy, neuroinflammation, excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), neuronal death and oxidative stress, which occurs due to disrupted metal homeostasis along with tau and amyloid-beta protein deposition. Notably, lipid peroxidation, iron buildup and elevated oxidative stress in AD brains suggest a possible molecular connection between ferroptosis and AD neurodegeneration. Methods: This study explores the genetic and bioinformatics perspective on the relationship between ferroptosis and AD aiming to identify potential therapeutic biomarkers using Neural network (NN) and Machine learning models. Six ferroptosis related genes were found to be differentially expressed in AD. Further machine learning analysis shortlisted four key biomarker genes. An NN-based diagnostic prediction model was developed and validated using AUC-ROC analysis, which gave high diagnostic values (AUC- 0.92) in the analysis. Results: The findings highlight a strong correlation between ferroptosis and altered metabolic functions in AD. miRNA-gene interaction analysis revealed that two biomarker genes, CYBB and ACSL4 can be regulated by several regulatory miRNAs i.e., hsa-miR-146-5p, hsa-miR-106b-5p, hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-125b-5p and hsa-miR-27a-3p suggesting their potential as early diagnostic biomarkers. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed strong neuroinflammatory responses were in AD with increased infiltration of macrophages (M0, M1 and M2), monocytes and multiple T cell subsets. This heightened immune activity may be driven by ferroptosis-induced oxidative stress, contributing to neuronal death. Furthermore, druggability of these targets was evaluated and several drugs were identified that may be potentially repurposed for therapeutic intervention in AD pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

GdpP integrates environmental signals through its sensory PAS domain to control its C-terminal catalytic domain activity, but the molecular basis for this allosteric communication has remained unknown due to the lack of structural data for the complete cytosolic region. Here, we present the first Cryo-EM structures of the cytosolic region of Streptococcus mutans GdpP (SmGdpP74) in multiple conformational states, revealing a sophisticated tetrameric architecture that enables asymmetric catalytic regulation. Our structural and functional analyses demonstrate that SmGdpP74 operates through substrate-induced conformational transition, with the DHHA1 domain interface serving as the primary determinant of asymmetric catalysis. The non-canonical GGDEF domain functions as a tetrameric scaffolding hub that positions the DHH-DHHA1 catalytic domains, representing the first detailed example of a GGDEF domain repurposed to stabilize heterologous catalytic domains. We identify a flexible GGDEF-DHH linker as a critical coupling element that transmits conformational signals between domains, with the conserved KRSR motif acting as a molecular switch for heme-mediated inhibition. Additionally, the flexibility of this linker is essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Based on these findings, we propose a comprehensive mechanistic model where SmGdpP74 integrates substrate availability with conformational changes for efficient hydrolysis and allosteric control of its enzymatic activity through the PAS domain. These structural insights provide a foundation for rational drug design targeting allosteric regulatory mechanisms in GdpP, potentially offering new approaches to combat antibiotic resistance in pathogenic Firmicutes.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

In terms of shape discrimination, we demonstrate that small subsets of landmarks can outperform full sets of landmarks. Examples are given in 6 insect families: Culicidae, Glossinidae, Muscidae, Psychodidae, Reduviidae and Tabanidae. In all of these examples where landmark-based geometric morphometry was effective in separating morphologically close taxa, the total number of landmarks was not as effective as some significantly smaller subsets. To find such performing subsets, we used a random approach. Thus, for each number of landmarks (subsets), we examined a random sample of their many possible combinations.

Amphioxus, an early-branching chordate with exceptionally high genomic heterozygosity (3.2~4.2% in sequenced species), offers a unique model to explore mutational dynamics in such contexts. It is unclear whether high heterozygosity in amphioxus is due to a large effective population size, an increased mutation rate, or both. Here, we perform deep short-read whole genome sequencing of a two-generation pedigree of the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae comprising two parents and 104 offspring, and develop a framework based on allele-aware parental assemblies as the reference to accurately identify DNMs. We detect 205 high-confidence DNMs, yielding a genome-wide mutation rate of 5.10 x10-9 per base per generation, which is comparable to that of vertebrates. Combining this estimate with observed nucleotide diversity, we obtain an effective population size of ~1.9 million, indicating that the elevated heterozygosity mainly results from a large effective population size. We observe a maternal-origin bias when considering all DNMs but a paternal-origin bias for early-occurring ones. Amphioxus harbors a much smaller fraction of CpG>TpG DNMs relative to vertebrates, attributable to its low methylation levels. We also investigate putative post-zygotic mutations in the offspring, revealing an unexpected paternal-origin bias. These suggest some distinct mutational mechanisms in amphioxus. Our study not only provides the first DNM measurement for amphioxus but also offers a generalizable strategy for studying DNMs in highly heterozygous genomes, facilitating mutation rate studies across chordates and other lineages.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

However, eye colour is a polygenic trait, and previous studies have revealed that a significant proportion of individuals self-report an eye colour that is not concordant with their genotype at rs12913832. Herein, we address the question: What common markers are influencing eye colour in individuals whose self-reported phenotype does not correspond to the expected phenotype based on their rs12913832 genotype. Building upon our prior investigation of iris pigmentation genetics in individuals with an expected \"blue eye\" background (rs12913832:GG genotype) in a sample of the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrows Health (CanPath) cohort, this study extends the analysis to include individuals with an expected \"brown eye\" background (rs12913832:AA+AG). We identified variants in SLC45A2, TYRP1, TYR, SLC24A4 and TSPAN10, which may influence eye colour presentation in individuals with the rs12913832:GG genotype and variants in IRF4, TYRP1 and OCA2, which may influence eye colour presentation in individuals with the rs12913832:AA+AG genotype.

Several of these loci were replicated using independent quantitative eye colour measures, including heterochromia and CIELAB colour dimensions.

We found that more gregarious females and those better connected to all parts of the entire social network had higher calving success, but plasticity in social behaviour in response to salmon abundance was not associated with this component of fitness. This lack of relationship may have arisen as salmon abundance in either current or previous years was not associated with the probability of producing a calf.

Through quantitative polymerase chain reaction and staining, we quantified the enrichment of bacterial P-cycling genes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization across different stages of wheat development and in differentially P fertilized soils in the presence and absence of root hair elongation. The loss of root hair elongation led to an enrichment of P-cycling bacteria during early seedling development, and P mineralizing bacteria dominated over P solubilizing bacteria. The AMF symbiosis was only fully established after several weeks of growth, and the loss of root hair elongation promoted mycorrhizal formation.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, cell lineages and organ sizes are largely invariant, and classical Hippo phenotypes such as tissue overgrowth are absent. Nevertheless, WTS-1, YAP-1, and the TEAD-like transcription factor EGL-44 form a conserved core module required for larval development past the L2 stage. Crucially, a direct role for Hippo signaling remains unestablished. To address this question, we generated a fluorescently tagged endogenous YAP-1 as a live biomarker of pathway activity. Upon WTS-1 loss, endogenous YAP-1 translocated from cytosol to nucleus in epithelium and intestine. Tissue-specific depletion revealed that intestinal, but not epithelial, WTS-1 is essential for progression past L2. The duplicated Hippo-related kinases CST-1 and CST-2 repressed YAP-1 nuclear localization in the epithelium but not intestine, indicating that intestinal WTS-1 functions without CST-1/2. The Ste20 kinase MIG-15, orthologous to Drosophila Misshapen and mammalian MAP4K4/6/7/8, was redundant with CST-1/2 for larval progression. Yet deficient MIG-15 uniquely increased YAP-1 abundance without driving nuclear localization.

Genome size and contents indicate different levels of integration of these strains into the planthopper host biology, and their diverse roles. Symbionts infecting one of the clades have some of the largest genomes among Bartonellaceae, at ca. 2 Mb, two others are under 700 kb, and the fourth is reduced to barely 158 kb. The planthopper-associated Tokpelaia strains with larger genomes, similarly to ant symbionts, encode multiple amino acid and vitamin biosynthesis genes, complementing the degraded nutritional capabilities of their planthoppers' ancient heritable endosymbionts. Strikingly, the smallest Tokpelaia genome lacks any genes linked to essential amino acid biosynthesis, in contrast to all other known insect-associated bacteria with genomes of comparable size. We identified a single vitamin biosynthesis gene and Fe-S cluster assembly genes as its only putative contributions to the host biology. Our results broaden the host spectrum of non-pathogenic Bartonellaceae, indicating that they have contributed to nutrition and symbiotic consortium function in diverse diet-restricted host clades. They also highlight an unexpectedly broad range of evolutionary outcomes for this important bacterial group.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

In the present study, our goal is to predict the progression of selected aging phenotypes in a given healthy individual as one continues aging past 65 years. Therefore, we developed a novel framework called Dynamic Views of Aging with conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (or DyViA-GAN) which is capable of predicting the plausible personalized trajectories of a selected aging phenotype conditioned on the available measurements of the phenotype at a few initial time instances, and additional covariates. Given the prevalence of osteoporosis in the aging population, we selected total hip Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of a healthy individual as the phenotype of interest, and baseline individual Body Mass Index (BMI) as the covariate. We trained DyViA-GAN on a publicly available longitudinal dataset of a large cohort of mostly white women in the United States of age 65 years or above. Thus, it generated, for each individual, continuous phenotype trajectories, along with a corresponding region of acceptable predictions, for an age range of 66 to 98 years, for eight different combinations both with and without involving the covariate. Our results clearly demonstrate the potential of generative deep learning frameworks in healthspan research.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Transcriptomic profiling of brain from AD patients revealed selective enrichment of IFN-I pathway in females. This immune signature was mirrored in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, where females exhibited more pronounced amyloid accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Acute IFN-I activation reproduced pathological features of AD, whereas chronic IFN-I elevation in APP/PS1 mice aggravated disease progression. In contrast, pharmacological targeting of IFN-I response by inhibiting the cGAS-STING pathway in APP/PS1 female mice reduced neuropathological burden, and preserved cognitive performance. Together, these findings identify interferon signaling as a modifiable and sex-linked driver of AD pathology.

I.", "abstract": "Cellular senescence protects against aberrant cancer proliferation by enforcing stable cell cycle arrest. The best-studied triggers of senescence involve DNA damage signaling, while DNA damage-independent senescence is less understood. In the cancer context, senescence has recently been shown to be induced by CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), a class of targeted therapies currently applied to breast cancer and sarcoma, among other tumors. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) can exert either pro- or anti-tumorigenic effects depending on its composition, making it a critical determinant of therapy outcome. The dependence of the SASP on the senescence trigger has been a controversial question, which we investigate here, particularly the involvement of NF-{kappa}B signaling. Using a multi-omics approach, we profiled the temporal dynamics of transcriptional and epigenetic state rewiring during therapy-induced senescence in CDK4/6i-treated liposarcoma cells over 28 days; we compared this to the effects of the DNA damaging chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin. Doxorubicin triggers an early and robust activation of p53 and NF-{kappa}B, as expected. Surprisingly, a delayed NF-{kappa}B-driven SASP signature also emerges in CDK4/6i-induced senescence after a 10-day exposure, in the absence of additional DNA damage. We replicated this effect in breast cancer cells over similar time courses. Inhibition of NF-{kappa}B blunts pro-inflammatory SASP expression without reversing cell cycle arrest in both treatment contexts, showing that NF-{kappa}B is a conserved SASP regulator, regardless of trigger and cancer type. Instead, the nature of the trigger regulates differential dynamics of the NF-{kappa}B response and additional SASP gene signatures, including a CDK4/6i-specific gene module driven by TEAD factors. Overall, our 28-day multi-omics time course reveals previously unknown dynamics of the SASP and demonstrates that both common and trigger-specific components of therapy-induced SASP can be separately tuned and uncoupled from cell cycle arrest, with implications for the rational design of adjuvant therapies.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

We combined culture in microfluidic chips to quantify growth and mechanical properties of propagules, perturbations with osmotic treatments, characterisation of cell wall polysaccharides, and a mathematical model of cell wall expansion that incorporates sensing. We found that FERONIA independently regulates tissue mechanical properties and growth rates. We propose that the regulation of growth by the FERONIA pathway relies on both a positive feedback from elastic deformation of the wall and a negative feedback from wall expansion.

H.; Verhoye, M.", "abstract": "Introduction: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by altered brain functional connectivity and network activity, detectable using resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Caloric restriction (CR) and its mimetic resveratrol (Rsv) have shown potential in reducing AD-related pathology and preserving brain function, though research on long-term efficacy is limited. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effects of short -term CR and Rsv administrations on resting-state (rs) functional connectivity (FC), after which we assessed the effects of long-term CR and Rsv interventions on rs-FC, spatial memory, amyloid burden, and neuroinflammation in TgF344-AD rats (Tg) and wild-type (WT) littermates. Materials and Methods: We used rsfMRI to investigate rs-FC changes after CR (40%) or daily Rsv supplementation (10 mg/kg, oral) in male and female, WT and TgF344-AD (Tg) rats at the age of 4 months and 11 months, after, respectively, 1 month (short-term) and 8 months (long-term) of either Rsv supplementation, control (Ctrl) or CR diet. Additionally, spatial memory was assessed utilizing the Morris Water Maze (MWM), followed by histological validation of amyloid plaque load (X34), astrogliosis (GFAP) and microgliosis (IBA-1) at 11 months of age. Results: Both long-term CR or Rsv supplementation exert limited effects in the TgF344-AD model on the known AD-related pathological hallmarks. Short-term CR led to a reduction in rs-FC in female TgF344-AD rats compared to Rsv Tg supplemented rats for connections primarily within and between the hippocampal network, while between other connections, CR reduced rs-FC compared to Ctrl in females, irrespective of genotype. Rsv increased rs-FC compared to CR for only a few connections in females, again irrespective of genotype. Long-term CR decreased rs-FC in male Tg CR rats, compared to Tg Ctrl and WT CR rats, primarily for connections within the lateral cortical network (LCN). For other connections, CR reduced rs-FC when compared to Ctrl, irrespective of genotype. Overall, Rsv supplementation showed negligible effects on rs-FC. Moreover, long-term CR yielded modest cognitive improvements in male Tg rats, as evidenced by enhanced performance in the MWM but not in females. Histological validation after long-term dietary intervention revealed region-specific increase or decrease of amyloid burden after CR or Rsv supplementation, respectively. Additionally, CR reduced IBA-1 levels in males, irrespective of genotype, GFAP levels were unaffected by long-term dietary intervention. Conclusion: Altogether, our findings indicate that long-term CR and Rsv exert distinct and limited effects on AD-related pathology in the TgF344-AD model, with CR demonstrating a modest but greater effect on functional and cognitive measures compared to Rsv. This study underscores the difficulty of altering key disease processes with these long-term dietary approaches, highlighting the need for more comprehensive long-term studies to elucidate the potential modulatory role of dietary interventions on AD pathophysiology.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Epigenetic processes in the brain have yet to be fully elucidated by DNAm findings from peripheral tissues, as these processes are complex to disentangle from DNAm tissue- and cell type-specificity. Furthermore, distinct brain cell types play important roles in brain health and disease. Building on previous findings of high blood-brain correlations at some DNAm sites, we specifically aimed to 1) identify single DNAm sites associated with DNAm-estimated brain cell type proportions in both the frontal brain and peripheral blood, 2) to combine blood DNAm sites to predict brain cell type proportions through multivariate models, and 3) to examine the role of biological factors associated with blood DNAm, age and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) on brain cell type proportions. Epigenome-wide association studies for seven distinct estimated brain cell type proportions in matched frontal brain and peripheral blood samples (n=104) revealed that ~7% of brain cell type-associated DNAm sites had correlating DNAm levels in peripheral blood (p<0.05). Six DNAm sites in peripheral blood were associated with endothelial and stromal brain cell type proportions (False Discovery Rate<0.05). Brain cell type proportion predictions trained with machine learning approaches using peripheral blood DNAm showed a correlation (p<0.05) with microglia and astrocyte proportions estimated through cell deconvolution using brain DNAm. Estimated blood immune cell type proportions were significantly associated with estimated brain cell type proportions. Lastly, brain EAA was associated with different brain and blood cell types proportions (p<0.05). These results show that DNAm levels in peripheral blood can inform brain cell type proportions, even though DNAm patterns are tissue-specific. The correlations between DNAm profiles specific to immune cell types in blood and brain highlights the link between the peripheral immune system and immune functions in the central nervous system.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we applied Vessel Isolation and Nuclei Extraction for Sequencing (VINE-seq) to build a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas from 101 individuals along AD progression. Our analysis of over 842,646 parenchymal and vascular nuclei reveals that vascular dysfunction in AD is driven by transcriptional changes rather than shifts in cell proportions, with brain endothelial cells (BECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) most affected. Strikingly, these molecular signatures emerge early at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, implicating vascular dysfunction early in AD pathogenesis. Stratifying by pathology reveals distinct vascular responses to {beta}-amyloid and tau: {beta}-amyloid burden primarily perturbs BECs and SMCs, while tau pathology predominantly impacts glial cells. We identify dysregulated angiopoietin signaling across multiple vascular cell types as a key axis, with antagonistic ANGPT2 in vascular cells and ANGPT1 in astrocytes becoming progressively dysregulated with AD.

Among these, the KSHV protein ORF24 serves as a TATA-binding protein (TBP) mimic essential for recognizing viral late promoters, although the molecular mechanisms underlying its function remain poorly characterized. Here, we used AlphaFold3 to predict the structure of ORF24 in complex with DNA and validated key features in both transfected cells and during KSHV lytic replication. Structural modeling revealed that ORF24 employs a non-canonical DNA binding mode where the C-terminal domain (CTD) makes critical DNA contacts beyond the canonical TBP fold. Targeted mutagenesis confirmed that ORF24 requires conserved TBP-like phenylalanines alongside a polar-rich binding interface distinct from cellular TBP. During infection, both the TBP-like domain and CTD are essential for ORF24 occupancy at viral late promoters. Most surprisingly, we discovered that ORF24 pre-assembles with RNA polymerase II and the viral protein ORF34 to achieve stable promoter binding. This cooperative assembly mechanism represents a fundamental departure from stepwise eukaryotic transcription initiation, resembling a prokaryotic strategy within the eukaryotic nucleus.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

INPP5E regulates the membrane makeup of the primary cilium, however its function in the specialized sensory photoreceptor cells of the human retina remain unclear. Here we utilize control and CRISPR/Cas9-generated INPP5E knock-out (INPP5EKD) human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate retinal organoids (ROs). Through proteomic and immunofluorescence analysis we show that INPP5E plays an important role in early retinal development and photoreceptor progenitor cell differentiation. In mature ROs, INPP5E localizes to the connecting cilium of photoreceptors, and the loss of INPP5E leads to altered localization of ARL13B and Rhodopsin in mature photoreceptors. Furthermore, photoreceptor outer segment structure is affected, leading to elongated outer segment membranes in both cone and rod photoreceptors, suggesting an important role for INPP5E in photoreceptor outer segment membrane biogenesis.

Here, leveraging single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq) data from 828 tumor samples spanning 13 cancer types, we systematically identified 407 CTGs based on their expression level in malignant cells. Compared to previously reported CTG sets, our curated genes exhibited broader expression among tumor samples and were predominantly enriched on autosomes. These CTGs displayed pronounced co-expression patterns, with a subset consistently activated in proliferating malignant cells, whereas non-cell cycle CTGs were highly correlated with epigenetic regulatory pathways. Functional analyses pinpointed chromatin-modifying genes, including ARID4B and YEATS2, as putative upstream regulators, whose knockdown resulted in widespread CTG downregulation. Moreover, we demonstrated that high CTG-count constitutes a robust and scalable feature for malignant cell identification across diverse omics data, including scRNA-seq, single-cell ATAC sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics. By quantifying transcriptomic similarity to a high CTG-count reference population, we developed a streamlined classification framework that enables rapid and accurate annotation of malignant cells in tumor sc/snRNA-seq datasets across diverse cancer types. Clinically, CTG expression levels were associated with patient prognosis and immune microenvironment composition. In hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated CTG expression defined a stem-like, immune-suppressive malignant cell state enriched for regulatory T cells, linked to advanced disease and poor survival.

Innovative strategies are required to overcome immune evasion. We have identified the splicing factor SLU7 as essential for the survival of cancer cells from diverse origins. SLU7 knockdown induces R-loop accumulation, transcription-dependent genomic instability, DNA damage, and replication catastrophe, together with aberrant splicing and inhibition of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and/or DNA methylation. These alterations lead to the expression of neoantigens, interferon B1, endogenous retroviruses, and cancer-testis antigens, which would enhance tumor immunogenicity. Therefore, we propose SLU7 targeting as a dual-action therapy, combining direct tumor suppression with immune activation. Using various murine cancer models, including orthotopic liver tumors, and multiple molecular strategies, such as inducible CRISPR/Cas9, systemic delivery of chimeric siSLU7-nucleolin aptamers (APTASLU), and intratumoral injection of siSLU7-loaded nanoparticles, we show that distinct siSLU7 sequences and delivery platforms effectively inhibit tumor growth.

Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays confirmed that this interaction is conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Additionally, yeast three-hybrid and luciferase complementation assays demonstrated that Mj-MSP18 disrupts the interaction between BSK7/8 and FLS2 in both yeast and in planta. Given that the BSK7/8-FLS2 interaction is essential for flg22-induced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), this disruption likely accounts for the suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and callose deposition observed upon transient expression of Mj-MSP18 in flg22-treated N. benthamiana leaves. Correspondingly, Arabidopsis and tomato bsk7 mutants exhibited increased susceptibility to root-knot nematode infection. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis of tomato hairy roots expressing Mj-MSP18 revealed extensive transcriptional reprogramming, including the downregulation of defence-related genes and hydrogen peroxide response pathways.

Here, during associative conditioning in honey bees, we concurrently tracked sub-second fluctuations in octopamine, tyramine, dopamine, and serotonin in the antennal lobe, where plasticity influences odorant representations. By repeatedly pairing an odorant with subsequent sucrose delivery, we observed individual differences in the conditioned response to odor, which occurred after a variable number of pairings (learners) or not at all (nonlearners). The distinction between learners and non-learners was reflected in neurotransmitter responses across experimental conditions. Remarkably, the speed of learning, i.e, the number of pairings prior to a proboscis extension reflex, could be predicted from monoamine opponent signaling between octopamine and tyramine), from both the first presentation of the odorant alone, prior to any pairing with sucrose, and from the first conditioned response to the odorant, coming after a number of sucrose pairings.

However, its application has been primarily restricted to the neocortex. Inferior brain regions, particularly the hippocampus (HC), are challenging targets for laminar fMRI. Recent developments in acquisition methods have shown the feasibility of laminar recordings in the HC using gradient-echo blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. Nonetheless, the spatial specificity of the BOLD signal is compromised by the draining veins' bias. Cerebral blood volume (CBV)-sensitive sequences including vascular space occupancy (VASO) have emerged as a promising augmentation tool to capture the vein-free laminar activity. Yet, its feasibility in the HC is unclear and challenged by methodological constraints. Here, we optimized VASO to mitigate the macrovasculature contribution in HC. By evaluating a series of advanced acquisition strategies tailored to HC, we obtained improved VASO signal quality with minimal artifacts. The optimized protocol was further validated with an autobiographical memory task. Our findings show that combining the high detection power of gradient-echo BOLD with the vein-free VASO contrast allows for differentiation between neural activity-related BOLD signals and those biased by draining veins. These results demonstrate the feasibility of submillimeter VASO acquired with conventional 7T scanners in the HC to map the circuit-level mechanisms of memory retrieval across HC subfields, laying a foundation to investigate the microcircuitry of HC-driven complex cognitive functions and their alterations in neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, and octopus) provide a unique system to study these processes due to a large-scale chromosomal rearrangement in the coleoid ancestor that resulted in highly modified karyotypes, followed by lineage-specific fusions, translocations, and repeat expansions. How these events have shaped gene regulatory patterns underlying the evolution of coleoid innovations, including their large and elaborately structured nervous systems, novel organs, and complex behaviours, remains poorly understood. To address this, we integrate Micro-C, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq across multiple coleoid species, developmental stages, and tissues. We find that while topological compartments are broadly conserved, hundreds of chromatin loops are species- and context-specific, with distinct regulation signatures and dynamic expression profiles. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of a putative regulatory sequence within a conserved region demonstrates the role of loops in neural development and the prevalence of long-range, inter-compartmental interactions. We propose that differential evolutionary constraints across the coleoid 3D genome allow macroevolutionary processes to shape genome topology in distinct ways, facilitating the emergence of novel regulatory entanglements and ultimately contributing to the evolution and maintenance of complex traits in coleoids.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Primary cilia, which are non-motile, antenna-like organelles projecting from the surface of most vertebrate cells, serve as key hubs for signal transduction, playing crucial roles in tissue development and cellular homeostasis. In this study, we identify a previously unrecognized role for primary cilia in mediating neuronal homeostatic plasticity using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. We show that neuronal cilia exhibit dynamic, bidirectional changes in volume in response to alterations in network activity: elongating during chronic activity suppression and shortening after increased activity. To assess the functional relevance of this ciliary plasticity, we modelled ciliary dysfunction in neurons carrying homozygous loss-of-function mutations in genes associated with neuronal ciliopathies, including NPHP1 and CEP290. Mutations affecting ciliary function either increased ciliary length or led to ciliary loss, and these mutant neurons exhibited severe impairments in homeostatic regulation across multiple domains -morphological, functional, and transcriptional. Specifically, NPHP1 and CEP290 deficient neurons failed to adapt synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability, and ciliary morphology in response to prolonged activity suppression. They also displayed dysregulated baseline network activity, and exhibited blunted gene expression changes. Together, these findings establish the primary cilium as a critical regulator of homeostatic plasticity in human neurons and provide a new framework through which to examine neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders linked to ciliary dysfunction.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Previous work showed that Type III Interferon (IFN-{lambda}) stimulates localized pockets of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the adult mouse intestinal epithelium at homeostasis that provide preemptive protection from viral pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that a major source of homeostatic IFN-{lambda} production in the intestine is a population of epithelium-associated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). Depletion of bacterial microbiota in the intestine also reduces pDC abundance, and pDC depletion or bone marrow reconstitution with IFN-{lambda}-deficient pDC results in reduced expression of homeostatic ISGs in the intestinal epithelium. Notably, intestinal pDC preferentially produce IFN-{lambda} over Type I IFNs whereas splenic pDC produce more Type I IFNs. Comparison of intestinal and splenic pDC reveal tissue-specific changes in gene expression and genomic accessibility, including evidence of responses to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}) in the intestine. Isolated gut pDC produce more IFN-{lambda} than splenic pDC upon stimulation, and pre-treatment of a human pDC cell line with TGF-{beta} results in enhanced production of IFN-{lambda} upon stimulation. This study demonstrates that pDC are an important source of homeostatic IFN-{lambda} in the intestine and defines the role of barrier cytokine TGF-{beta} in regulating IFN types produced by pDC upon stimulation. Reprogramming of recruited pDC by tissue cytokines may have important implications for balancing effective antimicrobial responses with damaging inflammation at barrier tissues.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Background: Heart failure is associated with the accumulation of lipid derived aldehydes that form immunogenic protein adducts. However, the pathological impact of these aldehydes and aldehyde-modified proteins in heart failure has not been assessed. Histidyl dipeptides, such as carnosine found in the heart, bind to aldehydes, and their protein adducts. However, the effects of carnosine on heart failure or the antigenicity of aldehyde modified proteins have not been studied. Methods: Male, wild type C57BL/6J mice were subjected to either sham or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. To increase carnosine levels, they were placed on drinking water with or without Beta-alanine prior to surgery, and for the remainder of the study. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography, and the levels of histidyl dipeptides, immune cell populations, and CD4+ T cell activation were assessed via LC-MS/MS and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: Myocardial levels of histidyl dipeptides decreased at both 3- and 8-weeks post-TAC. Supplementation with beta-alanine increased myocardial histidyl dipeptide levels, attenuated adverse cardiac remodeling, and reduced aldehyde stress. Carnosine formed covalent bond with protein-bound aldehydes in the failing heart, reducing their antigenic potential and decreasing activation of dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells in vitro. Beta-alanine supplementation decreased the population of CD11b+CD64-Ly6G+ neutrophils and CD4+ CD44+ effector T cells in the failing heart. Conclusions: Increasing myocardial carnosine levels reduces aldehyde stress, dampens maladaptive immune responses, and preserves cardiac function during heart failure. HIGHLIGHTS: Levels of endogenous dipeptide carnosine are depleted in failing hearts, while supplementation of the carnosine precursor beta-alanine increases myocardial carnosine and preserves cardiac function during heart failure. Heart failure is associated with increased activation and infiltration of CD4+ T cells and generation of aldehyde modified protein adducts in failing hearts. The free aldehyde moiety of aldehyde modified protein adducts activates CD4+ T cells through dendritic cell presentation and capping this moiety with carnosine diminishes their antigencity. Increasing myocardial carnosine levels diminishes aldehyde stress and activation of CD4+ T cells during heart failure.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Such genomic regions often contain genes important for pathogenicity and may be sequestered from the core genome on accessory chromosomes, which are variably present in isolates of a species. In this study, we present a pangenomic analysis of a fungal insect pathogen, Metarhizium acridum, using seven chromosome-scale genomes from four different continents. We show that approximately 25% of the M. acridum pangenome is comprised of genes only present in one isolate (singletons) or more than one but not all isolates (accessory). These genes are enriched for functions in secondary metabolite production, nutrient transport, and chromosome organization. We also find evidence of functional compartmentalization of the genome, as the core genome of M. acridum is enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes, while the accessory components are enriched in effectors that are located in gene-sparse regions of the genome. Furthermore, we identified the first naturally recovered accessory chromosome in M. acridum, which does not harbor effector or secondary metabolite proteins related to host-insect interactions but is enriched in functions related to sexual reproduction. Within the genus Metarhizium, M. acridum is one of few species considered to regularly reproduce sexually. We show that the accessory chromosome contains genes from both the MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 idiomorphs, in addition to the MAT locus found on the core chromosomes. Our findings suggest that the presence of this accessory chromosome may facilitate sexual reproduction, possibly even primary homothallism, in the otherwise heterothallic M. acridum. Overall, our study presents a putative novel mechanism whereby this fungal pathogen may acquire gene recombination and ensure maintenance of the accessory chromosome.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Background Producing second-generation ethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolysates (LCHs) poses significant challenges for Saccharomyces cerevisiae due to the presence of fermentation inhibitors. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of stress-tolerant S. cerevisiae strains is important for identifying adaptive alleles that can enhance yeast fermentation of LCHs. However, the QTL mapping process is labor-intensive, requiring the screening of numerous recombinants and repeated crossings to improve mapping resolution. Results We developed Reiterated Mass Selection and backcrosSing (ReMaSSing) to facilitate the identification of adaptive alleles through QTL mapping and to enhance LCH tolerance in yeast strains. ReMaSSing was applied to populations obtained by crossing the stress-resistant yeast PE-2_H4 with the laboratory strain S288C. Using alternative protocols, we selected haploid or diploid populations with dominant markers, enriching millions of segregants carrying adaptive alleles by propagating them in standard or LCH-supplemented media. The enriched pools were then bulk backcrossed with S288C, and germination of millions of spores generated new recombinant populations for subsequent selection cycles. After five rounds of ReMaSSing, whole-genome sequencing and QTL mapping identified key alleles associated with LCH tolerance, linked to VPS70, CAT5, GCY1, UBP2, MKT1/SAL1, HAP1, and PHO84, which influence growth and mitochondrial function in S288C. Mutations in IRA1 and HTA1, unique to our S288C strain, were also mapped, highlighting ReMaSSings ability to detect and correct deleterious alleles (bugs). Allele swapping and competition assays confirmed that the identified QTL improved LCH tolerance and growth, with strains combining adaptive alleles performing over 20% better than the parental S288C. Finally, applying ReMaSSing to breed an LCH-tolerant yeast with a xylose-consuming strain produced recombinants with improved fermentation of xylose-enriched LCH. Conclusion ReMaSSing offers a practical protocol for generating QTL mapping populations to identify adaptive alleles in tolerant strains and correct genetic defects in inferior ones. Notably, recombinant populations and clones derived from ReMaSSing outperformed both parental strains in LCH tolerance and growth. Furthermore, we applied ReMaSSing to breed strains with enhanced LCH tolerance, efficient xylose catabolism, and robust ethanol production. Together, these results demonstrate that ReMaSSing is a powerful tool for engineering industrial yeast strains that integrate desirable traits from multiple parental backgrounds.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

We report a hybrid approach that synergistically integrates computational deep learning with structure-guided rational design to develop enhanced NLuc variants that improve thermostability and thereby activity at elevated temperatures. By systematically analyzing libraries of engineered variants, we established that modifications to termini and loops distal from the catalytic center, combined with preservation of allosterically coupled networks, effectively enhance thermal resilience while maintaining enzymatic function. Our optimized variants - notably B.07 and B.09 - exhibit substantial thermostability enhancements (increases of 4.2 degrees Celsius and 5.2 degrees Celsius at 50 % solubility), leading to increased activity at elevated temperatures (320 % and 370 % of wild-type at 55 degrees Celsius). These variants maintain NLuc's pH tolerance and retain improved activity with the alternative substrate coelenterazine.

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting of Kdm8 in a Kras;Trp53-driven mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) robustly rewires the malignant cell transcriptomic programs, leading to a profound loss of the epithelial morphology and widespread metastatic disease. In PDA patients, a high KDM8-induced gene signature is associated with reduced metastatic burden and better survival in advanced disease. Notably, Kdm8 suppression in normoxia recapitulates key aspects of the global epigenetic and transcriptomic rewiring, mitotic spindle defects, and CIN induced by hypoxia. Moreover, disruption of Kdm8's demethylase activity phenocopies Kdm8 loss, whereas expression of hypermorphic Kdm8 variants resistant to hypoxic suppression markedly reduces metastasis beyond the levels achieved by the wildtype protein.

Here, we show that extended hypotonic shock results in the robust, ubiquitin-independent, CLIC-dependent endocytosis of Cav1 to form large, intracellular, Cav1-positive lysosomal vacuoles that are positive for the lysosomal marker LAMP1 and negative for MVB markers and the acidic lysosome indicator Lysosensor.

Disruptions in proteostasis lead to the aggregation of proteins into inclusions, a process that underlies many neurodegenerative diseases. To quantitatively assess the proteostasis capacity of neuronal cells, we employed an aggregation-prone double mutant form of firefly luciferase (denoted FlucDM) as a reporter protein. We compared two commonly used neuronal cell lines, mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a) and a motor neuron-like hybrid line (NSC-34), to evaluate their ability to prevent the aggregation of proteins into intracellular inclusions. We observed a significantly greater propensity of FlucDM to form inclusions in NSC-34 cells compared to Neuro-2a cells. This suggests a reduced capacity of NSC-34 cells for managing aggregation-prone proteins. Proteomic profiling of FlucDM inclusions purified from both cell types revealed cell-type-specific engagement of the proteostasis machinery with aggregation-prone proteins. Comparing the proteomic profiles of key arms of the proteostasis network between these two cell lines revealed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response is differentially expressed.

We have previously shown that stress response is predominantly mediated by its nuclear function as a transcriptional regulator; it operates at a conserved 8-bp DNA element that responds to moderate hypoxia, that we have termed the oxygen responsive element (ORE). This 8-bp element is the consensus DNA binding site for the transcription factor Recombination Signal Binding Protein For Immunoglobulin Kappa J Region (RBPJ{kappa}). We previously addressed the mechanism of nuclear MNRR1 by showing that it displaces the inhibitory transcriptional regulator CXXC-type zinc finger protein 5 (CXXC5), facilitating activation of genes harboring the ORE, and that it most effectively does so after deacetylation by SIRT1 at Lys119. A deacetyl mimetic mutant (K-R) rescues the phenotype in both genetic and environmental inflammatory models of defective mitochondrial function. Here we have refined the mechanism by which MNRR1 regulates transcription at the ORE. We show that MNRR1 interacts with RBPJ{kappa} and recruits the transcriptional co-activator p300 to facilitate transcription. We also show that a minimal domain of MNRR1 is sufficient to activate its nuclear function. Peptides based on this minimal domain can activate transcription by MNRR1 by enhancing p300 and RBPJ{kappa} interaction. MNRR1 peptides activate downstream pathways such as mitochondrial biogenesis and the unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in an in vitro model for MELAS.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

E.; Fantini, J.", "abstract": "Synaptotagmins 1 and 2 (SYT1 and SYT2) are essential membrane proteins in neurotransmission, aiding in synaptic vesicle fusion. The juxtamembrane domains of both SYT1 and SYT2 are recognized by botulinum neurotoxin B1 (BoNT/B1), the agent of botulism. Current experimental models describe SYT1 and SYT2 interactions with BoNT/B1 but lack membrane insertion, which may bias the observed interactions. Objective: To explore the interactions of membrane-inserted SYT1 and SYT2 with BoNT/B1 and assess the impact of membrane constraints on these interactions. Methods: We used molecular dynamics simulations to study the conformational changes of membrane-inserted SYT1 and SYT2 when bound to BoNT/B1, focusing on the influence of membrane constraints. Results: Our simulations predict that membrane constraints reshape SYT1 and SYT2, enabling their juxtamembrane domains to interact with the BoNT/B1 lipid-binding loop, a unique interaction not seen in Xray models but in agreement with experimental data. SYT1's conformation is particularly affected, increasing solvent exposure at its BoNT/B1 binding site. The GT1b ganglioside stabilizes this complex by reducing solvent exposure, providing mechanistic insights into its role in BoNT/B1-SYT1 interaction, as experimental data support. Conclusion: Our study reveals overlooked molecular mechanisms in non-membrane models, highlighting dynamics essential to BoNT/B1-SYT interactions. These findings could guide the design of BoNT/B1-targeted antidotes or drugs able to enhance binding efficacy for therapeutic purposes.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Plants have evolved to produce diverse molecules that inhibit protein translation. A lead example is homoharringtonine (HHT), both a key tool for ribosomal profiling and an FDA-approved treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia. HHT is commercially produced through semi-synthesis by esterifying the alkaloid core cephalotaxine (CET) extracted from endangered Cephalotaxus species. Despite its medicinal significance, a biosynthetic pathway to CET and HHT has not been described. Here, we use paired untargeted metabolomics (stable-isotope labeled precursor feeding) and transcriptomics to elucidate a near-complete biosynthesis to CET without prior knowledge of intermediates and biosynthetic genes. We show that while CET alkaloid core is actively biosynthesized only in growing root tips, both CET and HHT accumulate throughout the plant. We discovered and characterized seven CET pathway intermediates and six novel biosynthetic enzymes that, together, can be used to produce cephalotaxinone, the likely direct precursor of CET. Included are non-canonical cytochrome P450s, an atypical short-chain dehydrogenase, and a 2-oxogluatrate-dependent dioxygenase that together result in carbon excision and the formation of the characteristic pentacyclic backbone of HHT alkaloids. Our data support a model where cephalotaxinone is the last pathway intermediate produced specifically in the root tips, and its distribution throughout the plant is likely the starting point for subsequent elaboration to HHT. This study not only establishes a metabolic route to the core scaffold of HHT-enabling future sustainable, large-scale production of this valuable drug-but also suggests how Cephalotaxus species employ a whole plant coordination to regulate the biosynthesis of eukaryotic ribosomal toxins.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

To address this, several independent workflows have been developed to enable the profiling of the membrane proteome, however the relative advantages and limitations of each method remain poorly defined. Here, we systematically compare four classical solid-phase membrane proteomic workflows (SP3, SP4, FASP, S-Trap) and three membrane mimetic strategies (Peptidisc, nanodisc, and SMALP copolymer) for mass spectrometry-based membrane proteome profiling, using healthy (LFD) and obese (HFD) mouse liver tissue. We found that the solid-phase methods yield higher total protein identifications, while the membrane mimetic systems enrich MPs. SMALP copolymer displays intermediate characteristics between the solid-phase and membrane mimetic workflows. Peptidisc and nanodisc stand out for their enrichment of MPs, although Peptidisc shows better enrichment of plasma membrane integral MPs, particularly those with 11+ transmembrane segments. In the context of HFD-induced liver proteome remodeling, the Peptidisc workflow outperformed the other six methods by capturing the highest number of differentially expressed MPs and demonstrating the greatest accuracy in detecting MP-level dysregulation. Collectively, this comparative analysis highlights the trade-offs between depth of proteome coverage and MP enrichment across workflows, underscoring the importance of method selection based on total protein counts, MP enrichment, and the accurate detection of MP-level dysregulation.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we focus on globular protein members of the methyltransferase family: the TrmD-Tm1570 protein, which contains two deep 31 knots, and the single-knotted proteins TrmD and Tm1570, all from Calditerrivibrio nitroreducens. Using various biophysical experimental techniques and computer simulations with AI-based methods, we studied their thermal and thermodynamic stability, as well as their mechanical unfolding. Based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with the Structure-Based C Model (SBM-C) and UNRES (coarse-grained), we show that native contacts alone are not sufficient to fold double-knotted proteins. However, native contacts are sufficient to fold the single-knotted proteins TrmD and Tm1570 into their native conformations. Using the same model, we identified four possible unfolding and untying pathways, in which each domain can self-tie independently at some stage of the process. Optical tweezers (OT) experiments show that this process is also reversible, although the stretched state remains knotted. In addition, we observed higher thermal and mechanical stability in Tm1570 compared with TrmD, which is partly attributable to the position of the knot core. Overall, our results suggest that double-knotted protein from the SPOUT family can only partially self-fold, and that full knotting may require the assistance of a chaperone.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Like other IDPs, LEA proteins adopt ensembles of extended conformations that shift in response to environmental changes. Desiccation causes dramatic changes in the cellular environment, but it is unclear how the structural malleability of LEAs is related to their protective function. In this work, we measured the in vitro protective function and structural sensitivity to changes in the environment of four Arabidopsis thaliana LEA proteins from different families. We found that all LEAs showed different protection efficiencies of the labile enzyme lactate dehydrogenase under desiccation in vitro. In line with this, we identified distinct ensemble structural changes when these LEA proteins were exposed to different physicochemical environments. Specifically, AtEM1, AtLEA7, and AtLEA4-5 showed compaction when the solution was crowded with polymers, whereas AtLEA6-2.2 showed larger structural changes when salt concentrations were increased. Furthermore, the ensembles of AtEM1, AtLEA7, and AtLEA4-5 gained helicity under desiccated conditions, while that of AtLEA6-2.2 remained largely disordered.

Despite their central role in proteostasis, the molecular mechanisms by which Hsp90 coordinates with Hsp70 to remodel clients remain poorly understood. In particular, how ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90 is coupled to client engagement and conformational change has been a long-standing question. This gap in understanding is largely due to the challenge of visualizing client conformations during the highly dynamic and heterogeneous interactions with the Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperone machinery. To address this, we used a combination of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to observe individual firefly luciferase client proteins as they are sequentially engaged by Hsp70 and Hsp90. Here, we show that Hsp90 reduces rebinding of Hsp70 to folding intermediates while still allowing engagement to misfolded clients, thereby enabling productive refolding in the presence of typically inhibitory concentrations of Hsp70. Furthermore, Hsp90 uses ATP binding and hydrolysis to actively remodel the conformational landscape of the client, promoting controlled folding through localized compaction across multiple regions. These controlled folding events reduce misfolding and are essential for establishing native interdomain contacts. Using smFRET and kinetic simulations, we further demonstrate that heterogeneous Hsp70 binding generates region-specific folding kinetics and conformational dynamics, which are likely driven by variations in the number of available Hsp70-binding sites. This is then exploited during Hsp70/Hsp90-mediated folding to support localized folding of client subdomains, thereby reducing non-native interactions from distal regions to facilitate proper folding of multi-domain proteins.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

However, motion of membrane molecules is inhibited on one side by the cytoskeletal mesh, and on the other by the glycocalyx, a layer of proteoglycans with long polysaccharide chains that covers the membrane surface. A variety of biological fluid flows (including blood circulation, cilia-driven flows, and swimming motion of microorganisms) apply shear stress to cell surfaces. Cell responses to these flows govern important physiological processes such as blood pressure and immune activation. The presence of the glycocalyx is generally thought to shield cell membranes from shear stress that arises from flow. However, here we show that two different proteins, each attached by a lipid anchor to the extracellular membrane surface of living COS-7 cells, formed reversible, cell-wide concentration gradients in the direction of applied flow. Protein redistribution occurred within minutes after we applied shear stress levels commonly found in animal cardiovascular systems. The dynamic and spatial features of these gradients were consistent with passive transport by flow. Passive flow transport could be a general mechanism for spatial organization of membrane proteins. This mechanism may explain protein patterning previously observed on flow-exposed cells, and potentially forms an initial step in flow sensing.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

However, little is known about how they fulfil this function. Here we demonstrate that epithelial cells undergo a slow adaptation to stretch that couples a star-bundling transition of keratin filaments and the escape of the nucleus from its keratin cage. The bundling transition begins with a depletion of keratin filaments at tri-cellular junctions followed by a progressive accumulation in thick bundles that bisect cell-cell junctions. Bundling is a cooperative process that initiates in a few scattered cells and propagates to their neighbours through desmosomes, leading to the growth of multicellular clusters that contain a percolated network of thick keratin bundles. Bundling dynamics are slow and strongly influenced by the interaction between actin and keratin. Informed by a computational model, we provide evidence that keratin bundling generates a compressive stress on the nucleus, which is relaxed by nuclear escape from the keratin cage. The topological transitions identified here provide epithelia with a multiscale mechanism to adapt to sustained stretch.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

The T cell nucleus occupies a large fraction of the cell volume, and its mechanical properties are likely to act as a key determinant of activation. However, the contribution of nuclear mechanics to T cell spreading and activation is not well understood. Mechanical rigidity of lymphocyte nuclei is conferred by chromatin compaction and dense packing of heterochromatin. We find that nuclear deformation and increased chromatin compaction accompany T cell spreading, in T cells. Reducing chromatin compaction leads to increased cell spread area and nuclear deformation, while diminishing accumulation and peripheral enrichment of F-actin at the immune synapse. In contrast, enhanced chromatin compaction reduced spread area and nuclear deformation, which was accompanied by increased peripheral F-actin organization at the immune synapse. These findings suggest a reciprocal interaction between chromatin compaction and actin cytoskeletal organization. We identified SUN proteins and myosin as critical elements through which chromatin compaction orchestrates actin morphology and cell shape, facilitating T cell adaptation to antigen-presenting surfaces of varying stiffness. These results emphasize the crucial role of chromatin compaction in T cell activation, underlining the mechanical relationship between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton during immune responses, and suggest new avenues for understanding T cell mechano-responsiveness.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

A total of 70 semen collection attempts were conducted: 17 in captive males at ~monthly intervals over one year, and 53 in wild males just before peak mating season and again 2-4 weeks later, across three consecutive years (2021-2023). Electroejaculation was well tolerated and effective, particularly around the mating season, eliciting consistent responses and yielding sperm-containing ejaculates in 88.7% of wild procedures. Sperm morphometry revealed a mean total length of ~56m, with ultrastructural features resembling other eutherian mammals. Seasonal analysis demonstrated significantly higher sperm concentration, motility, and normal morphology during peak mating season compared to later samples. Post-peak samples showed increased structural abnormalities, including midpiece and principal piece defects, and signs of disrupted spermatogenesis and epididymal maturation. Cytology and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy confirmed these findings, revealing compromised sperm integrity and elevated round cell counts outside the breeding peak.

The current panzootic of genotype II is having a devastating impact on pig production in Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Hispaniola (Caribbean). Due to its high persistence and mortality rate, disease control policies require enhanced passive surveillance activities, wild boar depopulation, containment and other costly interventions, as a safe and effective vaccine is not currently available. Since 2007, several clusters have emerged far from both its original range, in South-Eastern Africa, and from other affected suid populations. These transmissions were likely caused by anthropogenic movement of contaminated material, facilitated by the persistence of the virus in the environment. The objective of this research is to understand the spatio-temporal dynamic of the ASFV panzootic, with a specific focus on clusters from mainland Italy. We mapped and analysed the virus spread using 228 whole-genome sequences available from online repositories and from the Italian cases/outbreaks, combined with their metadata. We inferred the pathogen phylogenies using a Bayesian phylodynamic model, with which we obtained a time-scaled and spatially explicit maximum clade credibility tree. Our results showed a non-negligible number of long-distance transmissions across regions or continents, coupled with dense local dynamics, particularly in areas where the disease affected a na&iumlve population.

In this study, we identify a dual-layered regulatory module involving MPK4-mediated phosphorylation and MAX2-dependent ubiquitination that synergistically control the stability and function of BRC1, a key SL-responsive transcription factor. Phosphorylation by MPK4 stabilizes BRC1, enhancing its activity and SL sensitivity, whereas loss of phosphorylation leads to BRC1 degradation and functional inactivation. BRC1, in turn, directly activates MPK4 transcription, establishing a positive feedback loop that amplifies SL signaling. Genetic analyses of the brc1-2 x mpk4 double mutant reveals phenotypic defects and SL insensitivity additive to those observed in the brc1-2 and mpk4 single mutants, indicating that MPK4 and BRC1 act in parallel yet converging pathways downstream of SL. Additionally, MAX2 functions as a regulatory checkpoint that degrades nonphosphorylated MPK4 and BRC1, thereby resetting the signaling circuit to ensure accurate and timely response.

Under oxidative stress, endo G relocates from the intermembrane space to the matrix, where it cleaves G4 motifs and generates mitochondrial double-strand breaks (DSBs). Notably, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) frequently harbours large deletions flanked by G4 motifs; these deletions are widespread in ageing and mitochondrial disorders, yet the mechanistic basis of their formation remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a damage-specific and stress-responsive mtDNA repair program that resolves EndoG-induced DSBs, using biochemical reconstitution and pharmacological inhibition. We show that these breaks are primarily repaired via microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), facilitated by the mitochondrial recruitment of canonical factors, including PARP1, MRE11, and Ligase III. Inhibition of PARP1 or MRE11 significantly impairs repair efficiency, confirming their essential roles in mitochondrial DSB resolution. Interestingly, exposure to ionising radiation (5 Gy) selectively suppresses mitochondrial MMEJ while enhancing HR, revealing a compensatory pathway switch tuned to the nature and severity of genotoxic stress. Classical nonhomologous ending (cNHEJ) remains undetectable under all conditions.

Renal fibrosis in ADPKD is primarily driven by myofibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, which contribute to disease progression. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of pirfenidone, an antifibrotic drug, on myofibroblast activity, ECM production, and ADPKD progression. Methods: Primary cultures of myofibroblasts from human ADPKD kidneys were treated with pirfenidone in vitro, and cell proliferation, migration, contractility and changes in ECM production were measured. In vivo, the effect of pirfenidone on cyst growth, fibrosis and renal function were determined in the Pkd1RC/RC male mouse model of ADPKD and wild type controls. Results: Analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing data of human ADPKD kidneys revealed that fibroblasts are a primary source of fibrous and cell-adhesive ECM, with higher ECM gene expression compared to normal human kidneys. Treatment of human ADPKD renal myofibroblasts with pirfenidone led to reduced ECM gene expression, cell proliferation, migration and contractility. In vivo, pirfenidone treatment in Pkd1RC/RC mice reduced renal fibrosis, collagen deposition, myofibroblast accumulation, pro-fibrotic gene expression and decreased TGF-{beta}/SMAD3 and mTOR signaling. While kidney cyst number remained unchanged, kidney size and cyst area were reduced, leading to improved kidney morphology and improved renal function in RC/RC mice.

Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are endothelial cells found in the bloodstream, yet their origin and functional potential have not been fully elucidated. To investigate their identity, we assembled and analyzed multiple public single-cell gene expression atlases comprising 212,144 endothelial cells from 23 human tissues. Using these datasets, we identified gene modules that quantitatively resolve endothelial types and states, including arterial, capillary, venous, lymphatic, and angiogenic-state programs, along with genes that are unique to endothelial cells of specific tissues. Leveraging this knowledge to 597 CECs, which we isolated from 2.1 million circulating CD34 cells across 287 donors, we found that CECs span a wide spectrum of mature endothelial identities and tissue-specific programs, consistent with diverse vascular origins. In culture, CECs downregulate mature endothelial markers (e.g., CD34) and acquire a progenitor-like PROCR transcriptional expression. Alteration of the Notch signaling in-vitro reverses this shift, with indirect activation of the pathway inducing a capillary and angiogenic program reminiscent of mature endothelial cells. As we profiled the angiogenic program in-vivo and created an in-vitro angiogenic EC model, we sought to determine whether similar transcriptional programs are present in the context of cancer. We analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets from normal and malignant breast tissue, uncovering a marked enrichment of angiogenic endothelial cells not only within the tumor but, surprisingly, also in histologically normal contralateral breast tissue from breast cancer patients, pointing to a previously unrecognized systemic paraneoplastic effect. Transcriptomic overlap between these in-vivo angiogenic cells and Notch-biased cultured CEC derivatives suggests that CEC cultures may serve as an accessible human model for tumor-driven and paraneoplastic vascular remodeling. Together, our study introduces a comprehensive framework for deciphering endothelial cell identity, illuminates CEC origin and plasticity, and provides a scalable platform to study cancer-associated endothelial reprogramming.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

A common genetic variant, rs641738, in the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase 7 (MBOAT7) gene, is strongly associated with disease progression. However, the physiological function and regulatory mechanisms of MBOAT7 remain incompletely understood. Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation is a hallmark of MASLD. In this study, we reveal a coordinated role of MBOAT7 and CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 2 (CDS2) in regulating LD size and cholesterol metabolism. Under normal conditions, CDS2 interacts with MBOAT7 at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In the absence of CDS2, however, MBOAT7 relocates to ER-LD contact sites in a RAB1-dependent manner, where it competes with DGAT2 for RAB1 binding. This competition inhibits LD expansion and promotes lipolysis. This MBOAT7-mediated LD size reduction activates the AMPK-LXR axis, enhancing cholesterol excretion, while loss of MBOAT7 or CDS2 disrupts this pathway, leading to hepatic cholesterol accumulation.

M.; Zhou, X.; Chen, J.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) functions as a transcriptional regulator in various cell types and tissues under both physiological and pathological conditions. While previous studies have linked ATF4 activation with promoting cardiomyocyte (CM) death in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, its role in developing CMs remains unexplored. METHODS: We generated multiple distinct CM-specific (Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA), Atf4cKO(e2) and Atf4cKO(e2/3/nopA)) and global Atf4 knockout (Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins) mouse models targeting different Atf4 regions, as well as cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 to study cardiac phenotypes. Detailed morphological and molecular analyses were performed. RESULTS: Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) (targeting exon 2-3 including the polyadenylation signal (polyA)) mice exhibited severe cardiac defects and died before E17.5, likely due to ectopic activation of p53 signaling pathway resulting from Rps19bp1 downregulation, a potent suppressor of p53. Further investigation revealed that deleting the polyA signal of Atf4 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice led to transcriptional readthrough, resulting in the formation of an Atf4-Cacna1i fusion transcript and Rps19bp1 downregulation. To avoid readthrough while abolishing ATF4 function, we introduced small indels into exon 3 of Atf4 in mice (Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins), which showed normal Rps19bp1 expression and cardiac morphology. Furthermore, CM-specific deletion of exons 2?3 while retaining the polyA signal (Atf4cKO(e2/3/nopA)) mice had no effect on cardiac development. Importantly, CM-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 recapitulated the cardiac defects and transcriptional change seen in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the downregulation of Rps19bp1, not loss of ATF4 function, underlying the cardiac phenotypes in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice. The reduced expression of Rps19bp1 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice is likely due to the unintentional deletion of Atf4 polyA signal and subsequent transcriptional readthrough, underscoring the essential role of RPS19BP1, not ATF4, in cardiac development. Consistent Rps19bp1 downregulation has been observed in other tissue-specific Atf4 knockout models utilizing the Atf4fl(e2/3/pA) allele, suggesting that previously reported Atf4 KO phenotypes may result from Atf4 transcriptional readthrough effects. These findings reveal a locus-dependent transcriptional interference mechanism and emphasize the importance of avoiding confounding cis effects in genetically engineered models.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we describe the impact of the lipid composition of meibum on its physiological properties, specifically thermotropic/melting characteristics, using various wild type and mutant animals, and compare them with meibum of healthy humans and patients with abnormal meibum. Meibum samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and differential scanning microcalorimetry (DSC). We found that changes in the balance between major lipid classes in meibum - wax esters, cholesteryl esters, triacylglycerols and free cholesterol - cause detrimental changes in its properties, leading to the loss of cohesiveness, abnormal expressibility from MG, a decline in its protective functions, and, ultimately, abnormal phenotypes of the eyes and adnexa. We conclude that tested animal species can be valuable models for studying human diseases. A combination of LC/MS and DSC can be a powerful diagnostic tool and may help to determine the molecular reasons of various pathologies in human subjects and animals.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Mutation of H148 to cysteine promotes the neutral chromophore in the monomer that excites predominantly at ~400 nm. Homodimerisation via a copper-dependent disulphide bridge, switches the chromophore to the charged phenolate that excites at ~490 nm. The result is ~30 fold increase in the fluorescence emission ratio. Homo-dimerisation kinetics are further improved by optimising the sfGFP homodimer interface, generating the variant termed GFP-diS2. Structures of the monomeric and dimeric GFP-diS2 suggests charge switching is through peptide bond flipping and the formation of a buried organised water network around the chromophore that span the interface region. Fusion to a leucine zipper protein dimerisation element greatly increased GFP-diS2 association rate making it a more effective copper sensor in vitro and in vivo with Cu(I) instigating the signal change quicker and at lower ion concentrations than Cu(II). Thus, GFP-diS2 provides the framework for generating a sensitive genetically encoded copper sensor and will eventually be adapted to monitor one of the most important protein-protein interactions in biology, homo-oligomerisation.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

S1P primarily exerts its functions by binding to G protein-coupled sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs), which include five subtypes (S1PR1-5), thereby activating these receptors and their downstream signaling pathways. Understanding the molecular determinants that govern agonist selectivity among different S1PR subtypes is vital for the rational and precise development of targeted therapeutic agents. Here, four cryo-electron microscopy structures of agonist-bound S1PR1-Gi complexes are reported. Through an integrated approach combining structural analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and pharmacological assays, the molecular basis for the selectivity of CYM5442, HY-X-1011, Ponesimod, and SAR247799 toward S1PR1 over S1PR3 and S1PR5 is uncovered. Specifically, the selectivity arises from a combination of non-conserved residues within the ligand-binding pocket and at the Gi-protein interface, distinct curved agonist-binding modes oriented toward transmembrane helices 5-7 that cause steric clashes with S1PR3, and the presence of branched moieties at the lower part of three agonists. These features collectively enhance agonist potency and efficacy for S1PR1 while reducing activity at S1PR3 and S1PR5.

Still, it is not fully understood which mechanisms and components are sufficient for symmetry breaking, and if they work independently or together. Here, we use a discrete active network model to investigate if and how an elastic cytoskeletal network is capable of breaking symmetry solely through mechanical interactions. Our minimal model consists of elastic bonds, attractive force dipoles, and force-sensitive anchor points, initially distributed uniformly and subject to simple turnover rules. We find that these features are sufficient to produce different cell behaviors, and, remarkably, to drive symmetry breaking and directed (polarized) motion. Network behavior was primarily determined by the turnover rate of anchor points, which, itself, is a function of the ratio between dipole force and the threshold force required for anchor removal. Directional motion emerged at intermediate turnover rates, at which tension in the network accumulated through several turnover cycles before eventually exceeding the adhesion removal threshold locally at the edge, mirroring our recent experimental findings on correlation of the traction force with protrusion-retraction transitions in the cell (Raynaud2016, Messi2020). At high turnover rates, forces were unable to build up to sufficiently high levels, while at low turnover rates, anchors hinder motion. These results demonstrate how directed motion can emerge as an intrinsic property of a simple mechanical network, independently of external cues or complex signaling networks. Given the concordance between this model and recent experimental findings, we suggest that polarization by contraction-adhesion dynamics could be a fundamental emergent behavior of actin-myosin networks.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Here we present a derivation of the solubility product showing that the solubility product is also a robust description of biomolecules phase boundaries if care is taken to account for soluble oligomers and variable composition within the dense phase. Our calculation describes equilibrium between unbound monomers, the dense phase, and an ensemble of oligomer complexes with significant finite-size contributions to their free energy. The biomolecule phase boundary very nearly resembles the power law predicted by the solubility product when plotted as a function of the monomer concentrations. However, this simple form is confounded by the presence of oligomers in the dilute phase. Accounting for the oligomer ensemble introduces complexities to the power law phase boundary including re-entrant behavior and large shifts for stoichiometrically matched molecules. We show that allowing variable stoichiometry in the dense phase expands the two phase region, which appears as curvature of the phase boundary on a double-logarithmic plot. Furthermore, this curvature can be used to predict variations in the dense phase composition at different points along the phase boundary.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

If left untreated, these processes can lead to retinal ganglion cell loss, damage to the optic nerve, and infant-onset vision loss, termed congenital glaucoma. To identify gene expression important for development of these specialized aqueous humor outflow pathway (AHOP) structures, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on rat AHOP tissues during three major periods of growth. High-quality transcriptomic profiles of 29,626 genes from 86,653 limbal cells were obtained and clustered into 13 general cell types. Refined identification of cell subtypes revealed 10,037 TM- and 546 SC-related cells that together showed enhanced expression of 395 genes compared to other limbal tissues. Interrogation of 44 genes known to be associated with Mendelian forms of childhood glaucoma revealed 36/44 (82%) were more highly expressed by SC/TM cells, whilst only 29/372 (8%) genes associated with complex later-onset glaucoma were specifically enriched. We propose prioritization of these selectively expressed genes during genome analyses of congenital/childhood glaucoma patients as they represent strong novel candidates for disease-causing variants. The transcriptomic dataset derived from these critical developing eye structures will also aid the generation of polygenic risk score estimates tailored toward early-onset glaucoma with underlying complex genetics.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase-1 (aaNAT1) is a salivary protein prominently produced in the salivary glands of Aedes aegypti. Previous research has demonstrated that mosquitoes with AaaaNAT1 mutations fail to efficiently inhibit host blood coagulation; however, the precise regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. This study identified the primary metabolites and proteins interacting with AaaaNAT1 through integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses. Combined with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), immunohistochemistry, ELISA, platelet function assays, and coagulation tests, we further established that AaaaNAT1 binds norepinephrine, reducing host platelet aggregation and thereby limiting activation of the host coagulation cascade and fibrinolytic system. Additionally, behavioral investigations showed that AaaaNAT1 knockdown in Aedes aegypti significantly prolonged the time required for female mosquitoes to locate a host and successfully obtain blood, while also markedly reducing blood consumption. This effect may stem from the inability of aaNAT1-depleted mosquitoes to effectively suppress host blood aggregation during feeding, as well as the downregulation of octopamine following AaaaNAT1 knockdown. Therefore, this study reveals a novel role for aaNAT1 distinct from its known functions in pigmentation and immunity, advancing our understanding of aaNAT1's role in insects.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

However, established metagenomic DNA extraction protocols are limited by trade-offs between universal taxonomic representation, DNA quality, quantity and molecule length, making them mostly unsuitable for 3rd generation sequencing. Methods We assessed the effectiveness of high molecular weight (HMW) DNA workflows from faecal samples, using different combinations of collection, storage and extraction kits. Faecal samples were either immediately processed, frozen at -80 0C or stored in DNA/RNA Shield, GutAlive or OMNIgeneGUT and then subjected to three different DNA isolation kits, each modified for mechanical, chemical and enzymatic cell lysis steps, totalling 32 evaluated combinations. Isolated DNA was assessed for its quality and quantity, while taxonomic consistency was evaluated using metataxonomics and validated with metagenomic sequencing. Results The yield of HMW DNA differed substantially between storage and DNA extraction protocols. Specifically, storage protocol had the highest impact on HMW DNA recovery, with DNA/RNA Shield storage yielding on average 51% more HMW DNA >30kb. Similarly, the sample storage had independently the effect size of R2 = 26.9% on the microbiome composition, and since the DNA extraction protocol in our study inherently combines both DNA extraction kit and lysis type, the latter had the largest effect size (R2 = 12.8%). While all kits had specific dis/advantages and biases, DNA/RNA Shield and Maxwell RSC PureFood GMO and Authentication kit performed best overall for long-read metagenomics. The protocol was validated on a) isolate genomes and b) 4 faecal samples, demonstrating both increased DNA yield at >30kb molecule length. Using the MG-TK pipeline these metagenomes yielded genomes on average, per sample, 48 Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and 55 Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) circular bacterial metagenomic assembled genomes. Conclusion The current gold-standard of freezing faecal samples was surprisingly inconsistent and inefficient for long-read metagenomics, necessitating rethinking gut microbial study designs.

In this study, we leveraged a collection of 142 SARS-CoV2 monoclonal Abs to systematically dissect the determinants of ADCC activity. We analyzed their epitope domain target, binding characteristics, neutralization potency, somatic hypermutation (SHM) and CDR3 length to determine the contribution of these features to ADCC activity. We found that ADCC activity is primarily shaped by epitope target-particularly targeting of the S2 domain of the Spike glycoprotein. ADCC potency was not associated with the degree of SHM or neutralization. Notably, ADCC activity was not correlated with binding affinity and moderate binding to antigen was sufficient for ADCC activity. By integrating these analyses, we provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the molecular and functional determinants of ADCC.

Such antagonism could have profound consequences on the fitness of species; however, the susceptibility determinants to even the most pervasive antagonistic factors in this ecosystem remain incompletely understood. Here, we screened for genetic factors that impact the susceptibility of Bacteroides to type VI secretion system (T6SS)-delivered toxins. This revealed that the Bte2 family of pore-forming toxins, which are widespread in B. fragilis and other human gut-associated Bacteroidales, strictly require the H+/Na+-translocating ferredoxin:NAD+ reductase (Rnf) electron transport chain within target cells in order to intoxicate. In Bacteriodes, the precise metabolic role of the conserved Rnf pathway has not been defined. We establish that the Rnf complex is important for redox balancing within cells utilizing sugars derived from dietary fiber and is critical for fitness in vivo. Surprisingly, we find that while the intact Rnf membrane complex is required for Bte2 intoxication, Rnf-catalyzed electron transport is dispensable. We propose that the Rnf complex facilitates Bte2 membrane insertion, leading to intoxication via membrane depolarization.

Scientific breakthroughs over the past century yielded fundamental mechanisms by which Wolbachia controls arthropod reproduction to shape dynamic ecological and evolutionary trajectories. However, the structure and spatial organization of symbiont machineries that underpin intracellular colonization and orchestrate maternal inheritance remain unknown. Here, we used cryo-electron tomography to directly image the nanoscale architecture of bacterial tools deployed for host manipulation and germline transmission. We discovered that Wolbachia assembles multiple structures at the host-endosymbiont interface including a filamentous ladder-like framework hypothesized to serve as a specialized motility mechanism that enables bacterial translocation to specific host cell compartments during embryogenesis and somatic tissue dissemination. In addition, we present the first in situ structure of the Rickettsiales vir homolog type IV secretion system (rvh T4SS). We provide evidence that the rvh T4SS nanomachine exhibits architectural similarities to the pED208-encoded T4SS apparatus including the biogenesis of rigid conjugative pili extending hundreds of nanometers beyond the bacterial cell surface. Coupled with integrative structural modeling, we demonstrate that in contrast to canonical T4SS architectures, the -proteobacterial T4SS outer membrane complex assembles a periplasmic baseplate structure predicted to comprise VirB9 oligomers complexed with cognate VirB10 subunits that form extended antennae projections surrounding the translocation channel pore.

However, comparative data regarding non-invasive and standard sampling methods remain limited, particularly in the Republic of Korea, where research on OF and FB sampling is sparse. Therefore, we investigated representative pig pathogens, including six porcine respiratory pathogens and three gastrointestinal pathogens, using OF and FB samples for pathogen surveillance across commercial farms in the Republic of Korea. Methods: The results from targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for major respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens obtained using OF and FB samples were compared with those obtained from standard samples. Non-invasive samples included 30 OF ropes and 30 FBs collected from nine farms, and 360 standard samples (blood, fecal, oral, and nasal swabs) were also collected. PCR assays for the nine pathogens were conducted, and the results from OF, FB, and combined OF+FB were compared with those from standard samples at the pen level. Results: OF sampling showed superior test concordance with respiratory pathogens than gastrointestinal pathogens, and FB sampling demonstrated superior detection of gastrointestinal pathogens compared with OF sampling. Additionally, the combination of OF+FB sampling improved the detection concordance for all nine target pathogens investigated.

While individual risk genes have limited impact, polygenic susceptibility increases the likelihood of schizophrenia and heightens sensitivity to environmental stressors, such as prenatal immune activation. Yet, preclinical studies often focused on single-gene mutations, leaving polygenic influences largely unexplored. Using the apomorphine-susceptible (APO-SUS) rat model, which exhibits schizophrenia-like features, we investigated how polygenic susceptibility influences early neurodevelopment, synaptic density, and behavior, and how these effects are modulated by prenatal immune activation. APO-SUS rats demonstrated early neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including a reduced number and duration of separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), increased principal frequency of USVs, and reduced heart rate variability (HRV), indicative of heightened sympathetic dominance commonly seen in psychiatric disorders. These effects were particularly pronounced in females. Male APO-SUS rats exhibited elevated synaptophysin levels, a presynaptic marker for synaptic density, in the frontal cortex during adolescence and in the hippocampus during adulthood. Interestingly, prenatal immune activation counteracted some of these changes, preventing HRV reduction and normalizing synaptophysin levels. Male and female APO-SUS rats, as well as Wistar male rats exposed to prenatal immune activation, showed anticipatory behavior during adolescence, but not in adulthood. Our results suggest that polygenic susceptibility induces early neurodevelopmental changes and that genetic and environmental risk factors do not always act synergistically; sometimes counterbalancing each other. Future studies should explore how early neurodevelopmental changes, such as alterations in USVs and HRV, influence later behavioral outcomes in polygenic models of schizophrenia.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

D20 within the tRNA D loop is particularly conserved and is formed by DusA in Escherichia coli . However, the mechanisms and cellular functions of DusA and D20 remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize DusA's role in tRNA binding, cofactor oxidation, and modification activity, along with its impact on tRNA maturation and translation. We find that DusA binds tRNA via a two-step mechanism involving a local structural rearrangement and exhibits a higher affinity for previously modified tRNA compared to unmodified tRNA. Unlike the T arm modifying enzymes TrmA and TruB, DusA does not broadly increase cellular aminoacylation for all tRNAs but enhances the charging of specific tRNA species. Despite limited alterations in overall tRNA charging and abundance in cells lacking DusA, DusA selectively improves translation at several specific codons, suggesting a direct contribution for dihydrouridine to the function of certain tRNAs on the ribosome. In conclusion, our findings suggest DusA acts non-redundantly with and complementary to TrmA and TruB in fine-tuning protein synthesis.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Edible insects such as Tenebrio molitor are promising alternatives because of their nutritional value, low environmental footprint, and suitability for mass rearing. However, the efficiency of industrial production depends on the optimization of reproductive processes. Moreover, T. molitor is also a pest species that contributes to grain loss, highlighting the dual need for strategies that increase reproduction under farming conditions and suppress fertility in pest populations. Neuropeptides, including tachykinin-related peptides (TRPs), are known regulators of metabolism and immunity, but their role in reproduction remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether TRPs are involved in female T. molitor reproduction. Expression analyses revealed strong correlations between TRP, TRPR and vitellogenin (Vg) gene expression, suggesting TRP-mediated stimulation of yolk precursor synthesis. The application of Tenmo-TRP-7 affects basic reproductive parameters, including egg production, follicular epithelium permeability, and terminal oocyte volume. These effects are confirmed by the use of dsRNA directed against the gene encoding TRP precursor.

We identified a gradual potential (GP) distinct from classical action potentials, whose amplitude attenuation and propagation distance were strongly influenced by stimulus speed and intensity. Although maximal GP amplitude near the bending site remained stable across stimulation setups, slower and gentler flexions led to more rapid spatial decay and reduced signal propagation. Similar GP responses were observed following either stem bending or direct root pressurization, suggesting hydraulic-electrical coupling. These results suggest that mechanical stress induces a transient hydraulic pressure wave that triggers the GP. While the GP's attenuation and propagation dynamics resemble those of a diffusive pressure signal, key features--such as constant peak amplitude regardless of stimulus strength and progressive signal narrowing--point to a complex, non-linear transduction mechanism.

We proposed a novel framework using VPD and dendrometer measurements to partition transpiration and refilling from nighttime sap flux density, and introduced a night-by-night baselining scheme that does not rely on identifying the zero-flow moment. One conventional baselining method using the maximum probe voltage (or temperature) difference substantially underestimated sap flux density by 204.56% for nighttime, 28.30% for daytime, and 45.20% for full-day flux in P. sylvestris, and by 344.77%, 45.68%, and 54.76%, respectively, in A. glutinosa.

Evaluation through gas exchange and evapotranspiration data confirmed the accuracy of partitioning between nighttime transpiration and refilling, demonstrating that nighttime transpiration can drive measurable nighttime evapotranspiration responses.

The key antigen of commercial vaccines is hemagglutinin (HA), the main protein on the surface of influenza viruses. This protein is genetically variable, necessitating the annual redefinition of the vaccine formulation. Furthermore, these vaccines do not offer protection against pandemic viral strains. The M2e peptide, a small surface protein conserved among influenza type A strains, could enable cross-immunity when used as an antigen. Nevertheless, its limited immunogenicity has restricted its application in universal influenza vaccines. To enhance the immune responses to M2e, we associated it with Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs). These NLCs are stable over time and their small diameter (<100 nm) enhances interactions with antigen-presenting cells and improve lymphatic drainage, facilitating their uptake by the immune system. The M2e specific antibody response in mice was enhanced by using 'click' chemistry to conjugate the M2e peptide to the NLC surface. Also, the incorporation of PADRE-specific CD4+ T cells stimulating peptide between M2e peptide and its linking region greatly enhanced the specific antibody response to M2e and generated immune response levels that could be compatible with influenza protection. This promising M2e formulation vectorized by NLC represents a potential universal influenza vaccine candidate warranting further preclinical investigations and clinical evaluation.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Using classical enrichment methods and single-cell sorting, we isolated a novel bacterial methanotroph species from Czech peatland soil: 'Candidatus Methylocystis sumavensis'. 'Ca. M. sumavensis' is moderately acidotolerant, growing optimally at pH 6.8 and 24 - 37{degrees}C, with a CH4 oxidation rate of 14.2 {+/-} 0.51 nmol CH4 {micro}g protein-1 {middle dot} hr-1. The complete genome encodes two isozymes of particulate methane monooxygenase and genes providing the capacity for nitrous oxide reduction to di-nitrogen (N2O). This suggests a potential role as a N2O sink, possibly enabling the new species to oxidise CH4 under low-oxygen or anoxic conditions. The presence of four terminal oxidases, two of which are of a high-affinity type, and two different [NiFe]-hydrogenases (3b and a putative 4f group) suggests a capacity for diverse respiratory processes, likely including anaerobic metabolism. Several acid stress response systems, most strikingly a H+/Na+-translocating F-type ATP synthase in addition to a classical H+-translocating F-type ATP synthase, likely support survival in the isolates oligotrophic, acidic habitat.

We characterised 110 S. suis strains from diseased pigs in Ireland (2005-2022) using whole-genome sequencing to investigate population structure and phage-host dynamics. We identified fifteen distinct serotypes, with serotypes 9 and 2 being the most dominant. In silico multi-locus sequence typing revealed high diversity within the collection, identifying several sequence types (STs), including 26 novel STs. Investigation of strain-level genomic clustering using PopPUNK against global S. suis genomes showed that the Irish isolates were phylogenetically dispersed across the broader global S. suis population rather than clustering in a single clonal group. The majority of Irish isolates fall within the ten established pathogenic lineages, including the highly virulent zoonotic lineage 1. A stable endemic clonal lineage was identified among Irish isolates, showing minimal genetic variation over a decade. Prophage analysis revealed novel viral taxa that were interspersed among known streptococcal phages, rather than clustering distinctly. Restriction-modification systems were the predominant anti-viral defence systems identified across genomes. CRISPR-Cas systems were present in limited strains but showed substantial targeting bias toward full-length prophages, indicating ongoing phage pressure. CRISPR spacers matched non-S. suis streptococcal phages, and phylogenomic analysis revealed that Vansinderenvirus phages clustered with S. suis rather than other S. thermophilus phages, suggesting evolutionary connections between phage lineages infecting different streptococci.

Partitiviruses have been largely overlooked following their designation as cryptic viruses. However, evidence is accumulating that they play an important role in the ecology of their hosts. Since the capsid proteins of partitiviruses have been implicated in virus-host interactions, exploring their structural biology may give clues into the evolution, horizontal transmission, and host adaptation of partitiviruses. The capsid of AhV shares the same organisation of 60 dimeric capsid protein protomers arranged with T=1 icosahedral symmetry as other partitiviruses. The structure, determined by cryo-electron microscopy to 2.4 [A], shows that AhV has a unique iteration on the protrusion domain with an extensive network of hydrophobic interactions among equivalent interdigitating loops at the dimerization interface. AhV also shares a conserved helical core in the shell domain, which we extend to all genera of the recognised partitiviruses using protein structure prediction. The helical core appears to be a conserved element of the picobirnavirus lineage of capsid protein folds and provides a template onto which various elaborations of the protrusion domain have evolved. The involvement of the protrusion in virus-host interactions has previously been proposed and our findings provide evidence of a structural device enabling capsid protein diversification during the evolution of the Partitiviridae.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

One area with great opportunity for expansion lies in the phylogenetic diversity of the fungal kingdom. Diversifying the use of fungal species, by assessing species from the phylum of mushroom-producing fungi (Basidiomycota) in solid-state fermentation, could open new avenues to foods with improved nutritional and sensorial properties. To assess these properties, we first determined the potential of basidiomycetes to ferment and colonize cereals and legumes. A phylogenetically diverse selection of eight species of basidiomycetes was analyzed on their radial growth speed and biomass yield. The best performing species were successfully fermented on brown rice (high starch), brewers spent grain (high fiber, high protein), and lupin (high protein, high fiber and high fat), and compared to Rhizopus microsporus var. oligosporus. Large variation in performance was observed between the different basidiomycetes on the three substrates in terms of biomass formation and metabolic behavior. The presence of an easily accessible carbon source, such as starch was needed to prevent deamination and thereby loss of valuable protein. With the correct formulation, basidiomycetes could fully ferment and colonize the substrate, thereby increasing the overall protein content and degrading the anti-nutritional factor phytic acid up to 80%. These results provide a methodology for screening of fungal species and substrates and demonstrate that basidiomycetous mycelia represent a promising source of phylogenetic diversity for novel food fermentations.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

We compared the metabolic parameters of V. natriegens versus another biotechnologically relevant bacterium Escherichia coli under fermentative conditions. Both species excreted a similar array of fermentation products but V. natriegens consumed less glucose and had a lower product titer. V. natriegens also exhibited rapid death, reaching extinction within 12 hours after the growth phase, 3 days sooner than E. coli. Rapid V. natriegens death was avoided, and glucose consumption and product titers improved, by increasing the buffering capacity of the growth medium, indicating that V. natriegens is comparatively sensitive to its organic acid fermentation products.

G.", "abstract": "Background RNAs fold into complex structures that critically influence gene expression. A prominent class of regulatory elements resides in the 5 ' untranslated region (5 ' UTR), where internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) promote cap-independent translation by directly engaging the ribosome. First discovered in viral genomes, IRESs have been classified into four types according to their structural compactness and factor requirements. While viral IRESs are well studied, cellular IRESs remain poorly understood: they display limited sequence conservation, reduced structural compactness, and variable dependence on auxiliary RNA - binding proteins known as IRES trans - acting factors (ITAFs). Whether their activity relies mainly on RNA structure or protein assistance remains unresolved. Here, we present a computational framework that combines in silico mutagenesis and RNA - protein interaction profiling to investigate IRES mechanisms and guide the design of synthetic elements. Results Using the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) IRES as a benchmark, we performed systematic single-nucleotide mutagenesis coupled with structural predictions. Mutations were classified as synonymous or non-synonymous based on their effect on the secondary structure. The HCV IRES showed overall robustness, but the domain interacting with eIF3 was particularly sensitive, consistent with its essential role in translation initiation. Extending this approach to other viral IRES families revealed distinct profiles of resilience: Aphthoviruses retained structural integrity despite extensive sequence variation, whereas Cripaviruses displayed higher variability. We then applied the same analysis to cellular IRESs, which proved more structurally sensitive, suggesting stronger reliance on cofactor support. To probe this connection, we used the catRAPID approach to predict interactions with translation-related proteins. The method distinguished IRESs with known ITAF binding, such as PTBP1, and highlighted stability-promoting mutations that increased the predicted affinity for translation factors. Conclusions Our in silico analysis indicates that mutational tolerance mirrors IRES cofactor dependence: compact viral IRESs are structurally robust, whereas non-viral IRESs are more reliant on protein interactions. By linking structure prediction with interaction profiling, we identify variants that both stabilize IRESs and improve binding to ITAFs or translation factors. This framework provides mechanistic insight into sequence - structure - function relationships and supports the rational design of synthetic IRES elements for therapeutic and biotechnological applications.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Studies of duplex structure and stability, and of nonenzymatic template copying chemistry, provide insight into the viability of potentially primordial genetic polymers. Recent work suggests that 2'-deoxyribo-purine nucleotides may have been generated together with ribonucleotides on the early Earth. Since DNA/RNA duplexes are known to be less stable than RNA/RNA duplexes, we have examined the impact of dA, dI, and dG substitutions on RNA structure and nonenzymatic template copying. We find that single 2'-deoxyribo-purine substitutions reduce RNA duplex stability, as expected. Crystallographic studies show that such substitutions lead to minimal structural changes but point to diminished solvation as a likely reason for duplex destabilization. Kinetic studies show that dI and dG substrates exhibit slightly weaker template binding and slower rates of template-directed primer extension than the corresponding ribo-purine substrates. In contrast, dA substrates exhibit much slower reaction kinetics but higher template affinity than rA substrates.

The universally conserved 16S rRNA nucleotide C1402, for example, is the only 2'-O-methylated nucleotide in the bacterial small (30S) ribosomal subunit and this modification fine tunes the shape and structure of the peptidyl tRNA binding site. The Cm1402 modification is incorporated by the conserved bacterial 16S rRNA methyltransferase RsmI, but it is unclear how RsmI is able to recognize its 30S substrate and specifically modify its buried target nucleotide. We determined a 2.42 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of the RsmI-30S complex and, with accompanying functional analyses, show that RsmI anchors itself to the 30S subunit through multiple contacts with a conserved 16S rRNA tertiary surface present only in the assembled subunit. This positions RsmI to induce an extensive h44 distortion to access C1402 that is unprecedented among 16S rRNA methyltransferases characterized to date. These analyses also reveal an essential contribution to 30S subunit interaction made by the previously structurally uncharacterized RsmI C-terminal domain, RsmI-induced RNA-RNA interactions with C1402, and an unappreciated dependence on a divalent metal ion for catalysis, marking RsmI as the first of a distinct class of metal- and SAM-dependent RNA O-methyltransferases.

In the pathogen Helicobacter pylori, shape is important for virulence, and transition to a coccoid form after prolonged growth enables immune evasion. One particular endopeptidase, HdpA, is known to be involved in the maintenance of cell shape and in the transition to coccoids. Here we show that along growth, HdpA is constantly associated with LhiA, an inner membrane chaperone lipoprotein that keeps it in check while protecting it from fast proteolysis. The crystal structure of the HdpA-LhiA complex suggests that this interaction freezes the autoinhibitory interaction between the first domain of HdpA and the third, catalytic domain. Analysis of the evolution of the HdpA and LhiA protein levels over growth suggests that transition to coccoids is not triggered by a burst in HdpA activity but rather by a gradual weakening of the sacculus caused by the small fraction of free HdpA in equilibrium with LhiA-sequestered HdpA.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

In ecology, species richness, the number of species, was a pioneer simple formula still currently most widely used as a biodiversity index. Species, functional, phylogenetic diversity indices then emerged from the feeling that combining species richness with the distribution of species' abundances, functional and/or phylogenetic characteristics could provide indices that are more linked to ecological phenomena than species richness alone. Although there are theoretically an infinite number of potential biodiversity indices, I show here that some widely used indices of biodiversity actually take on large values in the absence of diversity. I thus claim for stricter definition of mathematical formulas that can be classified as biodiversity indices and for the use of parametric guiding indices that generalize and connect existing indices, tracing paths through the jungle of indices. As a case study I develop a parametric guiding index, and applying it on bat diversity, I show that analyzing the mathematical properties of potential biodiversity indices is critical to evaluate their relevance as regards a study objective in ecology. I come to the conclusions that to improve applications of biodiversity indices in ecology we need to: stop claiming for a single best formula; acknowledge that biodiversity indices are above all diversity indices, with the particularity that they are applied to biological data; agree on a set of minimal conditions that any biodiversity index must fulfill; integrate a large panel of diversity indices in software packages to enable ecologists to select and apply the most relevant index for their study.

Despite its potential, the development of dedicated image analysis tools, particularly deep-learning-based models, has been limited, largely due to the limited accessibility of soft X-ray microscopes and the scarcity of labeled SXT data. To address this deficit, in this work, we present SXTractor, a self-supervised SXT feature extractor based on the DINO framework. SXTractor can be fine-tuned with minimal labeled data and effectively adapted to various downstream tasks. We demonstrate its utility on few-shot tomogram segmentation, where it significantly outperforms the model when trained from scratch. Furthermore, it achieves few-shot segmentation performance comparable to that of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), despite SAM being a segmentation-specific model pretrained on millions of labeled images with a significantly larger model size. Most importantly, SXTractor enables a diverse range of downstream applications of deep learning to SXT, thus offering a practical and scalable solution for SXT image analysis in data-constrained settings.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Straw from cereal and oilseed crops can support renewable energy, but its availability is constrained by on-farm uses, management practices, and farmers' access to knowledge of sustainable soil management. Because straw removal affects soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, which underpins soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration, understanding farmers' motivations and informational needs is critical to support sustainable straw management. We examined the determinants of straw management among farmers in Scania County, southern Sweden, testing three hypotheses: that manure application increases the likelihood of straw removal, that a higher proportion of leased land promotes straw removal, and that humus-rich soils are associated with a higher probability of straw removal. Survey data from 2021 were analysed using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) and permutation tests, incorporating farmers' expected utility. Results show that manure application increases removal probability, whereas a higher share of leased land reduces it. Removal was most frequent on soils with intermediate humus content. Cluster analysis identified three farmer profiles, revealing heterogeneous motivations and knowledge gaps, particularly regarding soil humus content, and underscoring the need for context-specific communication strategies. These findings demonstrate that similar straw management behaviours can arise from diverse motivations and local conditions. Linking expectations, soil properties, and practices provides actionable insights for targeted advisory and policy measures that balance agronomic and economic outcomes with long-term SOC-mediated fertility, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem services.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

R.; Mok, W. W.", "abstract": "When susceptible bacterial cultures are treated with antibiotics, some cells can survive treatment without heritable resistance, giving rise to susceptible daughter cells in a phenomenon termed antibiotic persistence. Current models of fluoroquinolone (FQ) persistence in stationary-phase cultures posit that post-treatment resuscitation is dependent on double-stranded break (DSB) repair through RecA-mediated homology-directed repair. Previously, we found that stationary-phase P. aeruginosa does not depend on RecA to persist. In this work, we ask whether P. aeruginosa FQ persisters from stationary-phase cultures require DSB repair at all. We measured DSB formation in Levofloxacin (LVX)-treated cells recovering from treatment using strains expressing fluorescently labeled DSB-binding protein, Gam. We find that, surprisingly, the majority of P. aeruginosa LVX persisters survive treatment without apparent DSBs. Persisters that have evidence of DSBs take longer until their first division compared to persisters without DSBs, and the phenotypes of their progeny suggest how persisters cope with DSBs--via repair or by damage sequestration--in order to successfully propagate. These observations pave the way for mechanistic studies into P. aeruginosa FQ persistence and highlight the need for single-cell tools to track FQ-induced damage.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

The different species and subspecies have adapted to their respective habitats and followed various evolutionary trajectories influencing their diversity. Hence, studying patterns of natural selection across this clade is an important aspect in understanding their biology. Results: We analyzed a curated panel of genomic diversity for bonobos, chimpanzees, eastern and western gorillas, and Bornean and Sumatran orangutans to explore their selection landscapes. A genome-wide screen was conducted for recent positive and long-term balancing selection, revealing candidate loci potentially related to sensory and immune systems, environmental pressures such as diet or altitude, and reproductive strategies in these species. In addition, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) was determined, along with the correlations of DFEs across lineages. Conclusions: We interpret the potential biological meaning of the landscapes of recent positive and long-term balancing selection in our closest living relatives, revealing novel lineage-specific candidate genes and gene categories, as well as recurrent targets across lineages. Our investigation of the deleterious DFE indicates that most non-synonymous mutations fall into either the nearly neutral or strongly deleterious categories, with high correlations between closely related lineages.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce endocytome profiling: a systematic, cell-type-specific approach for mapping cell-surface protein (CSP) dynamics in situ. Quantitative proteomic analysis of developing olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons generated an endocytic atlas comprising over 1,100 proteins and revealed the extent to which the surface proteome is remodeled to meet distinct developmental demands. Targeted interrogation of a junctional CSP showed that its endosome-to-surface ratio is precisely balanced to enable developmental axon pruning while preserving mature axon integrity. Multi-omic integration uncovered wide-spread transcellular signaling and identified a growth factor secreted by neighboring neurons to direct ORN axon targeting via endocytic regulation of its receptor. Endocytome profiling thus provides unprecedented access to cell-surface proteome dynamics and offers a powerful platform for dissecting proteome remodeling across diverse cell types and contexts.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Recent work suggests that the role of acetylcholine varies across cortical areas and behavioral states. In addition, the precise role of cholinergic signaling during learning and plasticity remains unclear. We performed simultaneous, dual-color mesoscopic imaging of ACh and calcium signaling in the neocortex of awake mice across multiple stages of visual task learning to identify learning-related plasticity in neural activity and cholinergic signaling. Using a novel Pattern Reconstruction and Interpretation with a Structured Multimodal transformer (PRISMT) model combining masked autoencoding with multimodal causal attention, we identified key cortical regions that reorganize with learning. We found that cholinergic signaling exhibited spatiotemporally selective plasticity in frontal cortical subnetworks during visual perceptual learning. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of transformer models for generating biologically interpretable insight into large multimodal datasets and link long-term functional reorganization of cortical networks to enhanced task performance.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

J.; Quinn, A. J.; Wolfe, J.; Pan, Y.; Pastuszak, A.; Jensen, O.", "abstract": "Visual search models have long emphasised that task-relevant items must be prioritized for optimal performance. While it is known that search efficiency also benefits from active distractor inhibition, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are debated. Neuronal alpha oscillations (7-14 Hz) have been associated with functional inhibition of cortical excitability, as well as distractor suppression in spatial attention and visual working memory tasks. We therefore hypothesised that alpha oscillations similarly support the deselection of distractors in visual search. Using Magnetoencephalography (MEG), we here show that high alpha power before the onset of a complex search display is associated with faster search performance. Crucially, we used a General Linear Model (GLM) approach to control for confounds between alpha power and task duration, ruling out that this result was merely driven by practice effects paired with increased fatigue over time. In addition to spontaneous oscillatory activity, we quantified the cortical excitability to colours of the search stimuli based on Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) responses. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, increased pre-search alpha power did not correlate with the RIFT response, providing no direct evidence for feature-specific inhibition of distracting stimuli by alpha. Our findings challenge the traditional view of alpha oscillations reducing visual processing, showing instead that increased occipital alpha power can enhance performance in a visual task. We propose that the increase in alpha power may reflect increased top-down control supporting visual search", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Multivariate classification and subspace analyses revealed separable neural representations of global and local positions. Local positions were better decoded in high-dimensional space, whereas global positions exhibited greater pattern separability in low-dimensional space. Brain regions encoding global positions exhibited longer neural timescales and reduced sensitivity to low-level event transitions compared to regions encoding local positions. These findings support a parallel hierarchical organization of content and context, a novel framework that enables integration of item and order across hierarchical levels and provides principles for hierarchical representations in both human memory and artificial intelligence.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

To address this question, we simultaneously recorded cortical and striatal activity while training mice on a visuomotor association task, which involved turning a wheel to move a stimulus from a cue location to a target location. Prior to the development of learned behavior, visual responses increased in the visual-recipient striatum. This was followed by the emergence of stimulus responses in both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and mPFC-recipient striatum from the onset of learned behavior. All of these regions also exhibited increased responses to stimuli in the rewarded target position, but while the visual-recipient striatum was non-selective between cue and target stimuli, the mPFC and mPFC-recipient striatum switched from being target-stimulus responsive before learning to being cue-stimulus responsive after learning. Our results suggest that sensorimotor learning involves routing stimulus information first to the sensory striatum, and then to frontal motor circuits.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

F.; Grinewich, V.; Reinwald, J.; Kelsch, W.", "abstract": "The ability to form stable de novo relationships in complex environments is essential for social functioning and is impaired in severe psychiatric disorders including autism. Yet, the neurobiological basis and cognitive processes enabling the formation of stable bonds in larger groups remain poorly understood, thereby limiting our ability to develop effective therapies. Here, we establish a semi-naturalistic model of clique formation in mouse societies, where individuals are tracked longitudinally from massive video data. Small, stable rich-clubs develop within these mouse social networks. Consistent with human rich-clubs, these cohesive cliques tended to have high social rank and exerted influence on non-members. Interestingly, neither prior rich-club-membership in a different group nor kinship facilitated entry into rich-clubs. Mimicking sparse population genetics, we probed the open question whether a subtle neuro-cognitive phenotype, namely impaired induction of social sensory processing states by cortical oxytocin signaling, disrupts higher-order social bonding in these complex social environments. Despite preserved social motivation, mice with alterations in this oxytocin subsystem failed to join rich-clubs. They approached group members less consistently, and connections from others towards them fluctuated more as well. This reciprocal disorganization highlights how interactional dynamics within social networks can amplify individual-level deficits, consistent with models of emergent properties of social behavior. These findings underscore the role of oxytocin in tuning sensory systems into a social processing state. Its dysfunction affects an individual's ability to establish stable relationships in complex social networks, with profound implications for social functioning deficits in psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Thirty-five female participants listened to self-selected pleasurable music and control stimuli while undergoing 90-minute PET-MRI scans. fPET revealed music-evoked increase in glucose consumption in auditory and motor cortices, as well as reward-related regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), caudate, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. The fPET and fMRI results showed substantial overlap though some discrepancies were also observed. Notably, the NAcc exhibited increased glucose consumption in fPET but showed no activation in fMRI. Conversely, deactivation of the default mode network during music processing was only observed with fMRI.

However, their essential nature often makes it difficult to define their mechanistic contributions in vivo. The chromatin remodeller CHD4 has been shown to be capable of sliding nucleosomes in vitro, and to regulate chromatin accessibility and gene expression in vivo. Using an inducible depletion system, here we identify a second mechanism of action for CHD4 in actively restricting the residence time of transcription factors on chromatin. Together these activities result in distinct, context-dependent outcomes: at highly accessible regulatory elements, CHD4 limits transcription factor binding to maintain regulatory function, while at low-accessibility euchromatic regions, it prevents transcription factor engagement and sustains chromatin compaction, thereby silencing cryptic enhancers. Collectively, these mechanisms enable CHD4 to reduce transcriptional noise while preserving the responsiveness of active regulatory networks.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

Ultrasound stimulation, a next-generation neuromodulation modality, offers unique advantages due to its wide range of tunable waveform parameters, including pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and acoustic intensity (I). However, there is still a lack of precision stimulation platforms and comprehensive biomarker assays for selective control of organoid development. Here, we introduce a modular piezoelectric ultrasound stimulation platform that integrates seamlessly with conventional multi-well plates, enabling parameter-controlled neuromodulation of midbrain organoids (mBOs). Using two distinct ultrasound regimes, we demonstrate that ultrasound can specifically modulate cellular differentiation by promoting dopaminergic progenitor markers while delaying terminal differentiation. Importantly, ultrasound stimulation did not induce cellular damage, as confirmed by the absence of apoptosis and DNA damage markers. This work demonstrates the potential of focused ultrasound as a safe, non-invasive, and tunable biophysical cue for temporal regulation of organoid differentiation and maturation.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}

While both information and infections spread across social networks, they typically have distinct mechanisms of transmission. Here, we model social information and behaviour spread as a complex contagion governed by a conformist learning rule, while pathogen transmission follows a simple contagion mechanism. Building on theoretical foundations, our study applies computational models to examine how subgroup structure (modularity) influences the spread of these contagions across diverse animal social structures sourced from the Animal Social Network Repository (ASNR). Our findings reveal that high modularity and subgroup structure slow simple contagion spread, whereas complex contagions are less impeded by this fragmentation.

This contrasts with evolutionarily motivated studies of learning, which typically view behaviour as either learnt or fixed to elucidate the ecological conditions where each predominates. Here, we envisage habit formation functioning to free up limited mental resources (e.g., attention), potentially improving an individual's ability to multitask. As an ecologically relevant case, we investigate exploration-exploitation in foraging under predation risk. In our model, a forager does not know the quality of feeding options, but can learn from the rewards they give. When the environment occasionally changes, individuals can attend to exploration of feeding options in the new conditions. The options can then become habitually exploited, freeing attention for antipredatory vigilance. Via evolutionary simulations, we show that evolutionarily stable forming and breaking of foraging habits can substantially reduce mortality from predation, without drastically reducing foraging success, when environmental conditions remain stable enough between changes. We therefore argue that exploration-exploitation strategies involving the forming and breaking of habits is a type of behavioural flexibility that is likely to be selected for under a range of ecological conditions.", "date": "2025-08-29", "journal": ""}
