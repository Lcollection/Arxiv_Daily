Previously, we have shown that two biosynthesis gene mutants of S. pneumoniae serotype 6B strain (proABC and fhs with an additional piaA mutation) can successfully colonise murine and human models without causing disease. Here, we test the hypothesis that epithelial microinvasion and an innate immune response persist despite disease attenuation. We show that although the{triangleup} proABC and{triangleup} fhs mutations do not attenuate microinvasion in either experimental human pneumococcal challenge or infection of epithelial cell models, there was less transmigration of Detroit 562 nasopharyngeal epithelial cells by the biosynthesis gene mutants than the WT. Cellular reorganisation by primary human airway epithelial cells varied considerably between strains. Compared to the WT, infection of Detroit 562 epithelial cells by the{triangleup} fhs/piaA strain but not the{triangleup} proABC/piaA strain was less pro-inflammatory, induced less caspase 8 production, associated increased pneumococcal hydrogen peroxide secretion and reduced pneumolysin activity. Under serum stress, these biosynthesis gene mutations had a broad impact on the expression of pneumococcal virulence genes (e.g. ply, nanA and psaA), those regulating oxidative stress (e.g. SpxB, lctO and adhE), and genes involved in purine and carbohydrate metabolism. However, although these may result in disease attenuation, they were not directly linked to effects on microinvasion, cellular reorganisation or the epithelial innate immune response. These findings suggest that the strain differences observed were driven by the differential expression of multiple bacterial virulence and metabolic pathways, rather than any single gene or pathway of genes. These data highlight the complex impact of single gene mutations on bacterial virulence and suggest that the virulence determinants of pneumococcal epithelial colonisation, microinvasion and innate immunity are not necessarily directly linked to disease.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

With the vascular system being directly impacted by a broad range of diseases, there is significant medical interest in quantitative analysis for vascular imaging. However, existing deep learning approaches for this task are specialised to particular tissue types or imaging modalities. We present a new deep learning model for segmentation of vasculature that is generalisable across tissues, modalities, scales and pathologies. To create a generalisable model, a 3D convolutional neural network was trained using data from multiple modalities including optical imaging, computational tomography and photoacoustic imaging. Through this varied training set, the model was forced to learn common features of vessels cross-modality and scale. Following this, the general model was fine-tuned to different applications with a minimal amount of manually labelled ground truth data. It was found that the general model could be specialised to segment new datasets, with a high degree of accuracy, using as little as 0.3% of the volume of that dataset for fine-tuning. As such, this model enables users to produce accurate segmentations of 3D vascular networks without the need to label large amounts of training data.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

The Ostreavirus ostreidmalaco1 (OsHV-1) is mainly associated with mortality in the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas, but has also been found in other mollusks, including the European flat oyster Ostrea edulis. This raises questions about OsHV-1 host specificity. This study explored the genetic differentiation of OsHV-1 in M. gigas and O. edulis and the underlying mechanisms. Using high-throughput sequencing, 40 OsHV-1 genomes were obtained from both O. edulis and M. gigas and were analyzed to assess viral diversity, lineage isolation, and cross-species transmission. Comparative genomics, population genetics, phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods revealed that host species significantly influence viral genetic structure. The data suggest that OsHV-1 was introduced in Europe with M. gigas, followed by a cross-species transmission event and divergence into two distinct lineages. Selection signals were identified in genomic regions involved in key viral functions, including host binding, DNA replication, and membrane-associated proteins, indicating possible adaptation to different hosts. Future research should investigate coevolution between OsHV-1 and a broader range of host species using phylogenetic approaches to better understand host-virus dynamics.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

The LINE1 retrotransposon is a ubiquitous repeat RNA whose de-repression leads to significant cancer cell-intrinsic and TME changes that promote aggressive tumor characteristics. We leveraged single cell spatial transcriptomic profiling to characterize the relationship between LINE1 and differences in the heterogeneous HCC TME. Experimental Design: We applied our profiling methodology to a cohort of 23 tissue specimens collected from patients who had undergone liver resection or transplantation and validated it in a partially-overlapping similar cohort of 39 specimens using RNA in-situ hybridization (RNA-ISH). Results: We found that LINE1-high tumors and LINE1-high single HCC cells exhibited a de-differentiated, stem-like, and inflammatory phenotype. Furthermore, within individual tumors, LINE1 high cancer cells associated spatially with one another and excluded the larger, organized immune cell conglomerates seen in LINE1 low tumors. Finally, we found that LINE1 RNA expression correlated with worse overall survival in the larger expanded retrospective cohort. Conclusions: Our study is the first to show a clearly disorganized immune TME in HCC driven by LINE1 expression, and this observation correlated with poor survival for patients whose tumors expressed large amounts of the LINE1 repeat RNA. These results provide further evidence of how effective anti-tumor immune responses contribute to cures after definitive surgery and may lead to novel biomarkers or drug targets in HCC.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Like many primary metabolites, mutations that disrupt lipid synthesis can be lethal. Proteins involved in lipid synthesis, trafficking, and modification, are targets for therapeutic intervention in infectious disease and metabolic disorders. The ability to rapidly detect these proteins can accelerate their evaluation as targets for deranged lipid pathologies. However, it remains challenging to identify lipid binding motifs in proteins because the rules that govern protein engagement with specific lipids are poorly understood. As such, new bioinformatic tools that reveal conserved features in lipid binding proteins are necessary. Here, we present Structure-based Lipid-interacting Pocket Predictor (SLiPP), an algorithm that leverages machine learning to detect protein cavities capable of binding to lipids in protein structures. SLiPP uses a Random Forest classifier and operates at scale to predict lipid binding pockets with an accuracy of 96.8% and an F1 score of 86.9% when testing against a set of 8,380 pockets embedded within proteins. Our analyses revealed that the algorithm relies on hydrophobicity-related features to distinguish lipid binding pockets from those that bind to other ligands. SLiPP is fast and does not require substantial computational resources. Use of the algorithm to detect lipid binding proteins in various proteomes produced hits annotated or verified as bona fide lipid binding proteins. Additionally, SLiPP identified many new putative lipid binders in well studied proteomes. Because of its ability to identify novel lipid binding proteins, SLiPP can spur the discovery of new and targetable lipid-sensitive pathways.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Task-guided GAN II improved prediction performance with limited real data, with gains of up to twofold augmentation observed. However, excessive augmentation did not result in further improvements, suggesting that augmentation complements, but does not fully replace, real data augmentation.

SCVR amplitude and hemodynamic delay were mapped at the group level as proof-of-concept of the approach, and in two highly-sampled participants to probe feasibility/stability of individual SCVR mapping. Across the group and individuals, a strong ventral SCVR amplitude was initially observed without accounting for local regional variation in the timing of the vasodilatory response. Shifted breathing traces were used to account for temporal differences in the vasodilatory response across the cord, producing maps of SCVR delay. These maps demonstrate distinct gray matter regions concordant with territories of arterial supply. The SCVR fMRI methods described here enable robust mapping of spatiotemporal hemodynamic properties of the human spinal cord. This noninvasive approach has the potential to provide early insight into pathology-driven vascular changes in the cord, which may precede and predict future irreversible tissue damage and guide the treatment of several neurological pathologies involving the spine.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Thus, it is not surprising that most animals have evolved neural mechanisms to detect and adapt to these regularities. Such detections and adaptations can, in turn, influence several cognitive functions including attention, perception, and memory, thereby enhancing survival. Here, we investigated whether detecting environmental regularities that are irrelevant to obtaining rewards can influence learning about multi-dimensional choice options--a process often constrained by the scarcity of reward feedback. To explore this, we trained human participants to perform a multidimensional reward-learning task alongside an orthogonal sequence-prediction task. We found that although feature-specific regularities in the sequence-prediction task were not predictive of reward, they incidentally biased participants' behavior toward the feature with regularity during the reward-learning task. Fitting choice behavior with various computational models revealed that this effect was more consistent with modulations in learning rather than decision making, as evidenced by higher learning rates for this feature. This was particularly apparent for learning from chosen, rewarded options and unchosen, unrewarded options, demonstrating that environmental regularities can amplify confirmation bias in reward learning. Our results thus extend the notion of confirmation bias in learning about options and actions to their features. Furthermore, they suggest that temporal regularities can influence reward learning by biasing the association of reward with specific features and by enhancing confirmation bias. These effects help reduce dimensionality of the learning task to mitigate the curse of dimensionality in reward learning.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Identity-by-descent (IBD) is increasingly being used in Plasmodium population genomics to estimate genetic relatedness, effective population size (Ne), population structure, and signals of positive selection. Despite its potential, a thorough evaluation of IBD segment detection tools for species with high recombination rates, such as P. falciparum, remains absent. Here, we perform comprehensive benchmarking of IBD callers -- probabilistic (hmmIBD, isoRelate), identity-by-state-based (hap-IBD, phased IBD) and others (Refined IBD) -- using population genetic simulations tailored for high recombination, and IBD quality metrics at both the IBD segment level and the IBD-based downstream inference level. Our results demonstrate that low marker density per genetic unit, related to high recombination relative to mutation, significantly compromises the accuracy of detected IBD segments. In genomes with high recombination rates resembling P. falciparum, most IBD callers exhibit high false negative rates for shorter IBD segments, which can be partially mitigated through optimization of IBD caller parameters, especially those related to marker density. Notably, IBD detected with optimized parameters allows for more accurate capture of selection signals and population structure; IBD-based Ne inference is very sensitive to IBD detection errors, with IBD called from hmmIBD uniquely providing less biased estimates of Ne in this context. Validation with empirical data from the MalariaGEN Pf7 database, representing different transmission settings, corroborates these findings. We conclude that context-specific evaluation and parameter optimization are essential for accurate IBD detection in high-recombining species and recommend hmmIBD for Plasmodium species, especially for quality-sensitive analyses, such as estimation of Ne. Our optimization and high-level benchmarking methods not only improve IBD segment detection in high-recombining genomes but also enhance overall genomic analysis, paving the way for more accurate genomic surveillance and targeted intervention strategies for malaria.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

G.; Steinruecken, M.", "abstract": "Detecting and quantifying the strength of selection is a main objective in population genetics. Since selection acts over multiple generations, many approaches have been developed to detect and quantify selection using genetic data sampled at multiple points in time. Such time series genetic data is commonly analyzed using Hidden Markov Models, but in most cases, under the assumption of additive selection. However, many examples of genetic variation exhibiting non-additive mechanisms exist, making it critical to develop methods that can characterize selection in more general scenarios. Here, we extend a previously introduced expectation-maximization algorithm for the inference of additive selection coefficients to the case of general diploid selection, in which the heterozygote and homozygote fitness are parameterized independently. We furthermore introduce a framework to identify bespoke modes of diploid selection from given data, a heuristic to account for variable population size, and a procedure for aggregating data across linked loci to increase power and robustness. Using extensive simulation studies, we find that our method accurately and efficiently estimates selection coefficients for different modes of diploid selection across a wide range of scenarios; however, power to classify the mode of selection is low unless selection is very strong. We apply our method to ancient DNA samples from Great Britain in the last 4,450 years, and detect evidence for selection in six genomic regions, including the well-characterized LCT locus.

Immune biomarkers, particularly those reflecting the interaction between the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral immune system, have shown promise for non-invasive detection through blood samples. This study investigates the reactivity of serum IgM and IgG from AD and FTD patients against a library of mimotopes representing public IgM reactivities in healthy donors. Serum samples from AD, FTD, and other neurodegenerative dementias (ND) and controls were tested on peptide microarrays. The samples were pooled to mitigate individual variability. The reactivity data were analyzed using graphs to represent the cross-reactivity networks. The analysis revealed distinct reactivity patterns for the studied groups. Public IgM reactivities showed significant correlations with neurodegenerative conditions, with AD and FTD exhibiting loss or gain of specific IgM reactivities. Graph analysis highlighted significant differences between disease and control groups in graph density, clustering, and assortativity parameters. Mimotopes of IgM reactivities lost in dementia, particularly in AD, exhibited significant homology to HCDR3 sequences of human antibodies. Furthermore, clusters of reactivities showed significant distinctions between AD and FTD, with IgG reactivities providing additional differentiation. Several self-proteins related to neurodegeneration proved to have sequences homologous to disease-associated mimotopes. Interestingly, the beta-propeller signature sequence YWTD found in ApoE receptor LRP1 proved a characteristic epitope for IgG in FTD but not AD. At the same time, the respective public |gM mimotope YWTDSSR coincides with a highly conserved sequence in many microorganisms and sequences found in human HCDR3.

Two main hypotheses are usually mentioned to explain it, the kinship and the sexual antagonism theories, together related to a conflict over resource allocation. Between the different common assumptions expected under these theories, directional selection on imprinted genes could help to discriminate the best theory to explain imprinting because the selection is expected, in regulatory or in coding regions respectively. But, so far, most researches that studied selection in imprinted genes have focused on autogamous species, whose conflict for ressource's allocation is expected to be low. Moreover, kinship theory is expected to promote intense antagonistic coevolution between imprinted genes, but this has never been tested so far. To address these knowledge gaps, using phylogenetic and population genomics approaches, we searched for signals of selection on imprinted genes across the Brassicaceae family and in allogamous and autogamous populations of Arabidopsis lyrata, and we investigated signals of coevolution across imprinted genes. Overall, we found that non-imprinted endosperm genes presented signals of balancing selection, as expected in the case of unresolved intralocus conflict. Moreover, according to kinship theory, the PEGs exhibited signals of directional selection but not in coding regions and this signal was sensitive to mating systems.

We found that, in comparison to morphological traits, phenological traits led to distinctive coevolutionary opportunities for species, which led to different emergent properties at community level. This is because phenological traits promoted facilitation over competition. While morphological coevolution led to modular and specialized interaction networks with a negative diversity-stability trade-off, phenological coevolution was required to achieve nested interaction networks with a positive relationship between diversity and structural stability. Our theoretical results were consistent with empirical observations: across 17 empirical pollination networks we found a high proportion of phenological motifs promoting facilitation over competition, suggesting an important role of phenological coevolution in community assembly. These empirical seasonal structures strongly enhanced the community stability and dampened the diversity-stability trade-off observed when neglecting them.

The duck sector was the most concerned by this crisis but other sectors such as broiler, layer and turkey were also affected by outbreaks. The objective of this work was to assess the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 virus transmission from one farm to another within the French broiler and layer production network. This study used the WOAH risk assessment framework. After drawing up a scenario tree of virus transmission from one farm to another, data were collected through a literature review or through experts' elicitation. Three questionnaires were developed according to the experts' field of expertise: avian influenza, broiler and layer sectors. The experts' estimates were combined using a beta distribution weighted by their confidence level. A Monte Carlo iteration process was used to combine the different probabilities of the scenario tree and to assess the transmission risk. In the broiler sector, the highest transmission probabilities were observed if the exposed farm was an indoor broiler farm and the source a broiler farm (indoor or free-range). The high transmission probability between broiler farm integrated within the same company highlighted the role of integration in this probability. The pathways which generated the highest transmission probabilities between two integrated indoor broiler farms with a good biosecurity level are person movement, transport of feed and manure management. In the layer sector, the highest transmission probabilities were observed if the source farm was a free-range farm and the exposed farm a production farm (indoor or free-range). The pathways with the highest transmission probabilities were egg transport and person movement. The sensitivity analysis showed that the exposed farm's biosecurity had a significant impact on the transmission probability. Our results provide an insight on the role of each type of farms in the virus spread within the French broiler and layer production sectors and will be useful for the implementation of control measures such as movement restriction or vaccination.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Yet, diversity patterns emerging from ROAs have received relatively little attention from biogeographers, even though characterizing the effect of key geo-environmental factors on island clades species distribution could be important for unraveling diversification dynamics. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis using island-specific species richness values for approximately one hundred ROAs across major oceanic archipelagos (mostly Hawaii, Canary Islands, Galapagos and Fiji) and taxa (vascular plants, invertebrates and vertebrates). Our aim was to determine whether (1) ROA species richness patterns scale as a function of key geo-environmental factors including island area, geological age, environmental heterogeneity (elevation and topographic complexity) and inter-island isolation, and (2) whether the magnitude of the effects of these factors varies across archipelagos and taxa. Our results identified elevation as a key driver of ROA species richness patterns on islands, supporting existing theoretical and empirical work that highlighted the central role of environmental heterogeneity in driving diversification on oceanic islands. As importantly, we found that the influence of geo-environmental factors varies across archipelagos and taxa, suggesting that unique archipelagic dynamics and biological traits together shape diversification differently. Our findings emphasize the value of applying biogeographical modeling at resolution of individual radiations to improve our understanding of evolutionary processes on oceanic archipelagos.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

By contrast, a range computational models implemented with biologically plausible properties or optimized for visual recognition did not reach child-level performance.

While existing studies have documented significant DOM release by zooplankton, the chemo diversity and properties of this DOM, along with the physiological mechanisms influencing these characteristics in the environment, remain inadequately explored. We conducted zooplankton sampling followed by onboard DOM release experiments in heterogeneous estuarine-coastal water systems, followed by molecular characterization of the DOM using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Additionally, we analyzed zooplankton metabolic activities through meta-transcriptomics to elucidate the relationship between the chemical properties of the released DOM and the underlying physiological processes of zooplankton. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the molecular diversity of DOM released by zooplankton, more specifically lipids-like, protein-like, and unsaturated hydrocarbon-like between mesotrophic and eutrophic coastal zooplankton communities. We found strong correlations between chemical composition of the DOM and zooplankton gene functions associated with metabolism processes such as carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide processing, energy production, and coenzyme metabolism. Furthermore, the modified aromaticity indexes of the released DOM are also highly associated with metabolism-related gene functions such as amino acid, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid, energy production, as well as glycan biosynthesis, indicating that zooplankton metabolic processes significantly influence DOM aromaticity. This study enhances our understanding of how organism metabolic processes shape the molecular characteristics of DOM they release, highlighting its implications for nutrient cycling in the environment.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 donors to uncover the sex-specific immune aging dynamics. We reveal that aging drives sexually dimorphic compositional and transcriptional shifts, with females showing stronger immune remodeling. Female-specific shifts include the expansion of three cytotoxic CD8+ T effector memory subpopulations and inflammatory monocytes. In addition, female CD4+ central memory T cells exhibit abundance shifts in subpopulations involved in autoimmunity alongside age-associated transcriptional signatures enriched for autoimmune-related pathways. Conversely, males show an age-related expansion of a B cell subpopulation associated with an asymptomatic precursor state to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Therefore, this study employed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis identifying upregulated genes of T-cells; and of cancer cells in two groups (cancer cells_vs_all-PDAC and cancer-PDAC_vs_all-normal). Common and unique markers of cancer cells from both groups were identified.

Here we report that during ciliogenesis in the bi-ciliated alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, aminophospholipid flippase 2 (ALA2) is recruited laterally from a reservoir on the plasma membrane onto the nascent ciliary membrane where it transfers conically shaped phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) from the outer to the inner leaflet.

A.; Boddy, L.; Fricker, M.", "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is widespread among living organisms, but exceptionally high levels of plasticity are rarely observed in nature. While plasticity can enhance fitness in fluctuating environments, it comes with substantial costs that limit both its expression and evolution. Most of what we know about these limits comes from studies on animals and plants, which typically have fixed body plans. In contrast, modular organisms such as filamentous fungi possess an undetermined, decentralized morphology that allows individuals to adjust their phenotype in response to local environmental conditions. This flexibility has led to speculation that fungi exhibit \"extreme phenotypic plasticity,\" making them an ideal system for studying plasticity mechanisms yet empirical tests of this assumption remain scarce. To address this gap, we analyzed grazer-induced morphological plasticity in four cord-forming fungal species exposed to soil microfauna with differing feeding behaviors, using a phenotypic trajectory analysis framework and tested alternative hypotheses: One hypothesis is that the flexibility of fungal network development would allow species to converge on a common \"grazing-resistant-phenotype\". Alternatively, the developmental plasticity for each species might be heavily constrained within species-specific limits. Our results showed that fungal species accounted for most of the total morphological variation, while grazer induced morphologies remained relatively aligned to non-grazed morphological trajectories. Instead of convergence, we found that grazed- phenotypes were more dissimilar across species, reflecting distinct developmental trajectories within species-specific limits. The extent of plasticity varied widely with a maximum of 30% of the morphological variation attributable to grazing pressure. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that morphological plasticity plays a relatively minor role in response to grazing for most species. The dominant species signature and constrained plasticity supports the use of morphological attributes of mycelia as functional traits in ecological studies. Our findings provide new evidence on the extent of plasticity of modular organisms and highlight the need to extend plasticity theories to include organisms with non-determinate, modular body types like fungi.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

However, sensitive, accurate and quantitative evaluation of HER2 expression based on current immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays remain challenging, especially in low and ultra-low HER2 expression ranges. We developed a novel methodology for quantifying HER2 protein expression, targeting breast cancer cases in the HER2 IHC 0 and 1+ categories. We measured HER2 expression using quantitative IHC (qIHC) that enables precise and tunable HER2 detection across different expression levels as demonstrated in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cell lines. Additionally, we developed an AI-based interpretation of HercepTestTM mAb pharmDx (Dako Omnis) (HercepTestTM mAb) using qIHC measurements as the ground truth. Both methodologies allowed spatial resolution and visualization of low and ultra-low levels of HER2 expression across entire tissue sections to demonstrate and enable quantification of heterogeneity of HER2 expression. Serial sections of 82 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of invasive breast carcinoma with HER2 IHC scores 0 or 1+ were stained with H&E, HercepTestTM (mAb), qIHC and p63, then scanned and digitally aligned. Tumor areas were manually selected and reviewed by expert pathologists. HER2 expression was quantitatively evaluated based on the qIHC assay in each 128x128m2 area within tumor regions. We observed statistically significant differences in HER2 expression between IHC 0, 0<IHC<1+, and IHC 1+ groups, and high level of spatial heterogeneity of the HER2 expression levels within the same tissue, up to five-fold in some cases. We demonstrated high slide-level tumor region agreement of estimates of HER2 expression between the AI-based interpretation of HercepTestTM mAb and the qIHC ground truth with a Pearson correlation of 0.94, and R2 of 0.87. The developed methodologies can be used to stratify HER2 low-expression patient groups, potentially improving the interpretation of IHC assays and maximizing therapeutic benefits.

A common way to represent the niche is through a multidimensional geometry known as the Hutchinsonian niche hypervolume. Ecological theory predicts that niche hypervolumes have properties such as holes with broader eco-evolutionary significance, but we lack a comprehensive empirical study of niche hypervolume properties and their evolutionary significance. Location Global Time period Holocene Major taxa studied Gymnosperms Methods We conducted for the first time a systematic and comprehensive test of the evolution of Hutchinsonian niche hypervolume properties (volume and holes) across 65 genera and 12 families of gymnosperms, which includes many species that are endangered or threatened. Using cutting-edge computational algorithms, we measured the evolution of geometric (i.e. volume) and topological (i.e. holes) properties of gymnosperm hypervolumes across a comprehensive calibrated phylogeny. Results Our comparative analysis revealed weak evidence of the non-independent evolution of niche hypervolume volume and no evidence of the non-independent evolution of hypervolume holes. We also found that genera and families with low hypervolume volume such as monotypic groups like Gingko, likely experienced shifts in hypervolume evolutionary rates. Main conclusions Our results show that geometric and topological properties of gymnosperm climatic niche hypervolumes evolve independently. This agrees with competitive exclusion hypothesis in ecological theory where extant groups are likely to be the ones which minimise niche overlap and competition.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

The populations of phages very rarely encoded antibiotic resistance genes and were mostly temperate including many phage-plasmids. Gut phages remained individual-specific even after microbiome perturbation by antibiotics. Yet, we found a 20% decline in phage diversity the day after treatment, alongside blooms of a few (mostly virulent) phages. We suggest that these temporary dominant phages contribute to the recovery of gut bacterial diversity through kill-the-winner dynamics.

These were combined into GelNB-GelSH photo-resins at 5, 7.5, and 10% (w/v) and crosslinked via thiol-ene chemistry. Physico-chemical analysis showed that increasing DS and polymer concentration reduced swelling and increased moduli.

Film-cast hydrogels, also with embedded MSCs, served as comparative controls. VAM-printed constructs exhibited significantly higher alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition, indicating enhanced osteogenesis. In contrast, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation were more pronounced in film-cast samples, due to their lower crosslinking density and stiffness.

Here, we aim to investigate EL's direct role in LDLR-independent uptake of LDL in hepatocytes. Control and LDLR-KO HepG2 cells were transfected with an empty plasmid or a plasmid encoding the human LIPG gene, and the cellular uptake of fluorescent human LDL was measured by FACS. To test the contribution of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), LDL uptake was assessed with and without the pre-incubation with heparin or a heparinase cocktail. Finally, tetrahydrolipstatin was used to inhibit EL enzymatic activity in uptake studies. Unsurprisingly, LDLR-KO HepG2 cells showed an 80% reduction in LDL uptake compared to controls (p<0.001). Remarkably, EL overexpression almost fully rescued LDL uptake in LDLR-KO cells (p<0.001), without effects in control cells. EL-mediated LDL uptake was completely blocked by heparinases and heparin in LDLR-KO cells, suggesting a crucial role of HSPG in EL-mediated LDL uptake. Notably, treatment with tetrahydrolipstatin reduced LDL uptake in EL-overexpressing LDLR-KO cells (p=0.0015). Our data reveals that EL facilitates the uptake of LDL in hepatocytes through an LDLR-independent, HSPG-dependent pathway that involves EL's enzymatic activity.

Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels.

In contrast, non-mammalian orthologues function as anion transporters, lacking electromechanical activity. To investigate the molecular and structural basis of this functional divergence, we performed ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) of prestin across vertebrates, followed by comparative structural modeling using AlphaFold2-multimer. We identified more than 200 amino acid substitutions along the lineage that lead to placental mammals, with early substitutions concentrated in the transmembrane domain (TMD) and late substitutions clustering in the STAS domain, particularly in the intervening sequence (IVS). Structural modeling revealed that early substitutions modulate protein-lipid interactions and interhelical contacts. In placental mammals, the IVS-loop adopts a distinct conformation that places a negatively charged patch near the chloride access pathway, potentially affecting the ion dynamics and voltage responsiveness. These structural transitions occurred without major rearrangements of the global fold of prestin, supporting a notion in which the novel function evolved through distributed substitutions within a conserved scaffold. Our findings illustrate how molecular exaptation, and incremental structural remodeling enabled the repurposing of an ancestral anion transporter into a voltage-sensitive area-motor, providing a framework for understanding the molecular evolution of complex biophysical traits central to auditory neuroscience.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Even though this phenomenon has been known for centuries and could provide unique insights into visual stability, the mechanisms that give rise to afterimage movement remain unclear. By means of custom-built presentation hardware in complete darkness, observers viewed a bright foveal inducer pulse during fixation, executed a saccade to a previously cued location, and performed spatial localization of the emerging afterimage with respect to briefly flashed probes. This psychophysical tracking of afterimages was accompanied by eye tracking, allowing us to estimate afterimage-movement gain by fitting a dedicated computational model that simulated human localization responses. The extent of afterimage movement was accurately predicted by the size of eye movements with remarkably stable but significantly hypometric gains. Gains were unaffected by (even false) post-saccadic visual feedback and remained constant when saccade amplitudes were successfully adapted to lower gains. Irrespective of saccadic adaptation, afterimage-movement gains were inversely related to saccade gain -- a finding that could be explained by a parsimonious efference-based model of head-centered visual localization.

Even though this phenomenon has been known for centuries and could provide unique insights into visual stability, the mechanisms that give rise to afterimage movement remain unclear. By means of custom-built presentation hardware in complete darkness, observers viewed a bright foveal inducer pulse during fixation, executed a saccade to a previously cued location, and performed spatial localization of the emerging afterimage with respect to briefly flashed probes. This psychophysical tracking of afterimages was accompanied by eye tracking, allowing us to estimate afterimage-movement gain by fitting a dedicated computational model that simulated human localization responses. The extent of afterimage movement was accurately predicted by the size of eye movements with remarkably stable but significantly hypometric gains. Gains were unaffected by (even false) post-saccadic visual feedback and remained constant when saccade amplitudes were successfully adapted to lower gains. Irrespective of saccadic adaptation, afterimage-movement gains were inversely related to saccade gain -- a finding that could be explained by a parsimonious efference-based model of head-centered visual localization. Our results suggest that afterimage movement across saccades is driven by feedforward prediction of the visual consequences of impending saccades and demonstrate the potential of the afterimage tracking technique for studying sensorimotor processes involved in active vision.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

On loss of adhesion, Arf1 activation drops, causing loss of dynein, promoting differential disorganization of cis- vs trans-Golgi along microtubules. Golgi regulates microtubule nucleation and stability. In fibroblasts, acetylated tubulin levels drop on loss of adhesion, recovering on re-adhesion with time. Active Arf1 overexpression in preventing Golgi disorganization sustains microtubule acetylation, also seen in T24 bladder cancer cells. Active Arf1 binds KIF5B, recruiting it to the Golgi. KIF5B and dynein knockdown disorganize the Golgi as ministacks, with cis- and trans-Golgi. Dynein knockdown disrupts MTOC positioning, causing ministacks to disperse, preventing Golgi reorganization upon re-adhesion. Dispersed ministacks interestingly maintain microtubule acetylation in adherent and non-adherent cells. The joint KIF5B- dynein knockdown causes the Golgi to lose its ribbon morphology, becoming compact while keeping cis- and trans-Golgi together. This also causes a change in spreading, aspect ratio and migration of knockdown cells, which could be regulated by their Golgi phenotype. In evaluating adhesion- dependent Golgi organization, we reveal the Arf1-KIF5B-dynein crosstalk to regulate Golgi- dependent tubulin acetylation and cell function.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

In our previous study, we described the association of known lncRNAs with dengue disease progression. However, little is known about novel lncRNAs in the context of dengue infection. In this study, we aimed to identify novel lncRNAs and characterize their interaction with mRNAs during different stages of dengue infection using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to better understand their role in dengue pathogenesis. Methods: We analyzed RNA-seq data (GSE94892) obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 39 dengue-infected patients. RNA-seq data analysis was performed using the Tuxedo protocol, and the coding potential of novel transcripts was examined using CPC and CPAT tools. LncRNAs and cis-regulated mRNAs were identified through location-expression analysis within a 20 kbp genomic region surrounding the identified lncRNAs. Results: We identified and characterized a total of 65 novel lncRNAs differentially expressed during dengue disease progression. These included 34 long intergenic lncRNAs, 2 antisense lncRNAs, and 25 alternatively spliced lncRNAs classified based on their localization. Bioinformatics analysis predicted potential cis-regulated target genes. Co-expression analysis revealed a strong correlation between lncRNAs and genes enriched in pathways related to megakaryocyte development and platelet production, suggesting a potential role in dengue pathogenesis. Furthermore, comparison with miRBase-21 indicated that some of the identified lncRNAs could act as miRNA precursors, highlighting a novel function of lncRNAs in gene regulation. Conclusion: We developed an analytical pipeline to identify novel lncRNAs from RNA-seq data. Our analyses led to the identification of novel lncRNAs and their associated genes involved in dengue disease progression. These findings provide insights into the functional role of lncRNAs in dengue pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

The poricidal anthers of these flowers release pollen in response to frequency-specific vibrations, which buzz-pollinating bees, including bumble bees and many solitary bees, generate via rapid oscillation of flight muscles. Honeybees are incapable of sonication and typically avoid visiting buzz-pollinated plants, although they have previously been observed to scavenge residual pollen from petals of buzz-pollinated flowers in natural settings. Here, we report a novel interaction in which honeybees consistently visit and extract pollen from flowers of Solanum elaeagnifolium (silverleaf nightshade) within a large invasive plant population in Northern Greece. We postulate that honeybee foraging effort on S. elaeagnifolium reflects the shortage of alternative floral resources at the peak of the Mediterranean summer, consistent with observations for pollen-starved bees in captivity. This newly established behavioral shift of honeybees may convey important implications for plant invasions, particularly under climate change, and requires further investigation for untangling its ultimate drivers.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

We evaluate ageing in different local body systems (liver, lungs, spine, intestine, muscle, heart), the brain, and across the whole body using 70,000 subjects from the UK Biobank population study. We analyse correlations between lifestyle factors --such as smoking-- or diseases and accelerated ageing.

H.; Diep, C. H.; Spartz, A.; Ostrander, J. H.; Lange, C. A.", "abstract": "Exposure to progesterone is a recognized risk factor for breast cancer, and PGR polymorphisms are associated with various malignancies. Two progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms, full length PR-B and truncated PR-A, are expressed from the PGR gene in breast tissue and play crucial roles in normal physiology and breast cancer progression. An imbalance in the expression ratio of these isoforms, favoring increased levels of PR-A, is common in breast cancer and is associated with resistance to tamoxifen in luminal A-type tumors. Notably, PRs have recently been implicated in promoting endocrine resistance and driving the expansion of cancer stem-like cell (CSC) populations. Despite this insight, the isoform-specific molecular and epigenetic mechanisms underlying PR action in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers remain understudied. Phenotypic studies of T47D cell lines that express exclusively PR-A or PR-B showed that PR isoforms regulate divergent cell fates. PR-B-expressing cells have a higher proliferation rate, while PR-A-expressing cells produce more mammospheres. We profiled progesterone-driven gene expression in cells grown in both adherent (2D) and mammosphere (3D) growth conditions and found differential gene regulation by PR-A and PR-B that is consistent with the observed divergent phenotypes. Only the PR-A-driven gene signature of ER+ breast cancer cells maintained as non-adherent mammospheres robustly predicted poor clinical outcome in the METABRIC data set. We then performed CUT&RUN to identify the genomic binding patterns unique to each PR isoform and their suite of target genes. Our findings indicate that PR-A acts as a regulator of the cell cycle, while PR-B plays a pivotal role in metabolism and intracellular signaling. Our genomic profiling of PRs in this model system has unveiled novel isoform-specific functions of PR. This work has shifted our prior understanding of the role of PRs in gene regulation, offering potential insights for therapeutic interventions in ER+ breast cancer.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we develop a reproducible method to fabricate biomimetic scaffolds with patterned fiber alignment along multiple orientations. While extrusion-based approaches are commonly used to align fibrous polymers in a single orientation parallel to the direction of flow, we hypothesized that extrusion-based 3D printing could be utilized to achieve more complex patterns of fiber alignment. Specifically, we show control of lateral spreading of a printed filament can induce fiber alignment that is either parallel or perpendicular to the flow direction. Theoretical prediction of the printing parameters that control fiber orientation was experimentally validated using a collagen biomaterial ink. The velocity ratio of the printhead movement relative to the ink extrusion rate was found to dictate collagen fiber alignment, allowing for the informed fabrication of collagen scaffolds with prescribed patterns of fiber alignment. For example, controlled variation of the ink extrusion rate during a single print resulted in scaffolds with specified regions of both parallel and perpendicular collagen fiber alignment. Human corneal mesenchymal stromal cells seeded onto the printed scaffolds adopted a spread morphology that aligned with the underlying collagen fiber patterns. This technique worked well for filaments either printed into air or extruded within a support bath using embedded 3D printing, enabling the fabrication of 3D structures with aligned collagen fibers. Taken together, this work demonstrates a theoretical and experimental framework to achieve the reproducible fabrication of 3D printed structures with controlled collagen fiber patterns that guide cellular alignment.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

We performed single-cell sequencing on patients with both psoriasis and atherosclerosis to analyze changes in the immune microenvironment within their carotid plaques and psoriatic lesions. We found that IL-17A significantly upregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., CXCL8) in macrophages of psoriatic atherosclerosis patients, leading to weakening of the fibrous cap structure of plaques. Additionally, IL-17A further exacerbated plaque instability by interfering with macrophage lipid metabolism, particularly sphingolipid metabolism. Finally, using in vitro experiments and animal models, we demonstrated that IL-17A enhances pro-inflammatory and metabolic abnormalities in macrophages by downregulating PPAR{gamma}.

Cardiac macrophages contribute to disease progression, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Methods: Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, bulk RNA-sequencing, proteomics, metabolomics, and a mouse model of pressure overload were employed to investigate cardiac remodeling. We identified a macrophage subset co-expressing CD163 and Dab2 and examined its role using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and functional assays. We further assessed the Nrg2/ErbB4 signaling axis through genetic and pharmacological modulation. Results: CD163+/Dab2+ macrophages were reduced in hypertrophic hearts and positively correlated with Nrg2 expression. These macrophages alleviated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro, an effect abolished by Nrg2 knockdown. In vivo, recombinant Nrg2 treatment mitigated cardiac hypertrophy, preserved mitochondrial structure, and restored bioenergetics via the ErbB4 receptor. Transcriptomic analyses confirmed enhanced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, CD163+/Dab2+ macrophages improved mitochondrial dysfunction by the Nrg2/ErbB4 pathway in vitro.

While they have been reported to be highly anthropophilic, several studies indicate a broader host range. They are also reported to take multiple blood meals between gonotrophic cycles. Consumption of multiple blood meals makes determination of host usage difficult when using common blood meal analysis methods.

To address this challenge one possible approach is to train a predictor for the localized functional activity using multimodal EEG-fMRI records and utilize that predictor in real-time EEG sessions. Using publicly available multimodal real-time EEG-fMRI data, we present a detailed evaluation of regularized linear regressors both in the context of predicting localized fMRI activity, and to characterize the properties of individual EEG-fMRI runs. Our results indicate that while it is possible to find clusters of similar time-series in which localized brain activity is highly predictable (Pearson's r=0.43), the capacity to train regularized linear regressors able to generalize to new subjects remains limited (r=0.24), highlighting two distinct strategies in EEG-fMRI neurofeedback settings. We characterize the fundamental role for the clustering distance used to identify similar time-series, based both on theoretically-grounded considerations and experimental observations. Our results suggest a clear preference for the cosine metric, instead of the Pearson-based metric utilized in current literature.

The adrenergic mechanisms by which intramyocardial nerves contribute to arrhythmogenesis are poorly understood. Semaphorin-plexin signaling pathways are responsible for developmental guidance of sympathetic nerves onto the heart and have previously been associated with VAs in humans. Objective: To investigate adrenergic control of arrhythmogenesis, we probed the cardiac electrophysiology of a Plexin-A3/-A4 double knockout mouse with loss of cardiac adrenergic nerves. Methods: We studied cardiac structure and function using tissue clearing, immunohistochemistry, and echocardiography. We utilized ECG in vivo and ex vivo in a Langendorff preparation to evaluate electrophysiologic responses to pharmacologic beta ({beta})-adrenergic stimulation and blockade, and we measured {beta}-adrenergic receptor ({beta}AR) density in cardiac membranes using radioligand binding. Finally, we performed a phenome-wide association study utilizing data from the UK Biobank to search for associations between PLXNA4 and human arrhythmias. Results: Mice with loss of plexin-dependent cardiac innervation had structurally normal hearts but displayed spontaneous VAs driven by adrenergic hypersensitivity, as well as increased cardiac {beta}AR density. Several human PLXNA4 variants were associated with arrhythmia phenotypes. Conclusion: These data establish a model of VAs driven purely by enhanced adrenergic receptor signaling, in the absence of structural heart disease, which can be used to investigate adrenergic mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis and to identify novel antiarrhythmic targets.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Although systemically delivered synthetic ligands allow for noninvasive actuation of chemogenetic receptors, direct intraparenchymal injection remains atop the available methods to precisely deliver chemogenetic payloads to a specific target of the brain. The requirement of trephination, however, is accompanied by inherent risks of infection, long recovery times, and often tissue damage with concomitant behavioral complications. When considering therapeutic injections, the requirement of transcranial surgery does not translate well to the clinic, especially when repeated administrations are required. Here, we leverage our recent development of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) for noninvasive and focal delivery of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) carrying excitatory Gq-DREADDs to frontal cortical targets (areas 6DR and 8aD) in the marmoset brain. Using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography, we demonstrate significant increases in glucose metabolism at the site of viral delivery after administering the DREADD-specific agonist deschloroclozapine (DCZ), as compared to vehicle control. Focal neuronal DREADD expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry at the site of opening. Through comparison of awake resting-state functional connectivity (whole brain connectivity with the sites of delivery) and structural connectivity (directly injected viral neuronal tracing at the sites of delivery) we demonstrate that the increase in glucose metabolism occurs at both mono- and polysynaptically connected brain regions.

Here, we use a combination of genetic models and in vivo perturbations, single cell transcriptomics and imaging to delineate the process of lining formation in mice. We find that the synovial lining is immature at birth and becomes established within the first 3 weeks of life. In this window, the lining is gradually populated with macrophages that originate from fetal sources, proliferate and acquire the lining-specific transcriptional identity. In contrast, monocytes contribute only minimally to the developing lining, and their input remains limited in healthy adulthood. We identify CSF1 and TGF{beta} as key signals in this process, which also involves mechanosensing through PIEZO1.

However, the relative influence of group type (i.e., social structure), group size, and habitat disturbance on parasitic infection remains unclear, particularly in Southeast Asian primates. In this study, the abundance of intestinal parasites in proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) inhabiting a riverine forest along the Menanggul River, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, was investigated. Fecal samples (n = 160) were collected from one-male-multifemale and all-male groups in areas with varying levels of anthropogenic disturbance, with efforts made to ensure that each sample originated from a different individual. In addition, the effects of group type, group size, and sampling location on parasite abundance were evaluated using fecal egg counts and Bayesian models. Three dominant parasite species groups (Trichuris sp., Strongyloides fuelleborni, and Oesophagostomum aculeatum) with an overall infection prevalence of 81.25% were identified. Results showed that group type did not significantly affect parasite abundance. However, group size showed a positive correlation with the abundance of Trichuris sp. and a negative correlation with S. fuelleborni and O. aculeatum. In addition, our models revealed that the infection loads of Trichuris sp. decreased with the increase of distance from the river mouth (less disturbed upstream areas), whereas O. aculeatum exhibited higher infection loads with greater distance, indicating a lower prevalence in more disturbed downstream areas.

We used the pantropical Xylopia (Annonaceae) genus to address the diversification of rain forest lineages through time, across different regions, and into novel non-rain forest habitats with a comparative phylogenetic approach. Location: Global (pantropical) Methods: We generated a time-calibrated phylogeny of Xylopia using hybrid capture sequence data, including 88% (168/191 spp.) of species within the genus. Diversification analyses were conducted to test for the presence of rate heterogeneity (BAMM, ClaDS, CoMET) and environmental-dependent (RPANDA), geographic-dependent, and habitat dependent (GeoHiSSE) diversification in Xylopia. Results: Significant diversification rate heterogeneity was detected along the backbone of the core Xylopia clade, leading to near synchronous radiations across tropical regions globally in the Miocene, with higher diversification rates in Africa, Central America, and Madagascar, and lower rates in Australia + New Guinea. Transitions from rain forest to subhumid habitats led to lower diversification rates, whereas transitions to ultramafic habitats lead to higher rates. Regional diversification models indicate sea-level changes as an important driver for Asian, Australian, Pacific, and Neotropical clades and regional temperature changes as the main diversification driver for an African clade of Xylopia. Main conclusions: Our study shows that despite synchronous radiations across regions, different regional environmental drivers have affected the diversification of Xylopia across tropical regions globally. A noteworthy example includes radiations of all five Malagasy clades c. 7 Ma coinciding with the establishment of heavy seasonal rainfall linked with the Indian monsoon. The diversification dynamics of rain forests are complex and heterogenous, with different clade-dependent and region-dependent environmental drivers.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Antiviral resistance evolution poses a major obstacle for controlling viral infections. A promising strategy is to target shared viral proteins that allow drug susceptible viruses to sensitize resistant ones during cellular coinfection, muting selection for resistance. Pocapavir, a poliovirus capsid inhibitor, employs this sociovirological strategy. While susceptible viruses significantly suppressed resistance in the presence of pocapavir in cell culture, a pocapavir clinical trial observed widespread resistance evolution and limited improvements to clearance times. To reconcile these findings, we present an intra-host eco-evolutionary model of poliovirus in the presence of pocapavir, which reproduces both the potent interference observed in vitro and the resistance emergence seen in patients. In the short term, our model predicts that a high density of susceptible viruses sensitizes resistant ones to pocapavir, mirroring cell culture results. However, over multiple replication cycles, pocapavir's high potency collapses viral density, which reduces coinfection and allows resistance to evolve as observed in the clinical trial. Since coinfection is essential to suppress resistance, enabling greater survival of susceptible viruses could offer therapeutic advantages. Counterintuitively, we demonstrate that this can be achieved by lessening antiviral potency, which can limit resistance evolution while also maintaining a low viral load. These findings suggest that antivirals that rely on viral social interaction must balance immediate neutralization with the preservation of future coinfection, yielding more sustained inhibition. Explicitly considering the eco-evolutionary feedback encompassing viral density, social phenotypes and absolute fitness not only provides new insights into designing effective therapies but also illuminates viral evolutionary dynamics more broadly.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

This intraspecific variation provides a valuable system for investigating the genetic basis of salt tolerance. A major QTL for salt tolerance was previously identified by crossing salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive accessions, but the responsible genes remain unknown. In this study, grafting experiments between the two accessions revealed that the root plays a primary role in salt tolerance by suppressing Na transport to the shoot. We then conducted root transcriptome analysis and identified four candidate genes located within the QTL and highly expressed under salt stress in the tolerant accession: CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 6 (CIPK6), CAFFEOYL SHIKIMATE ESTERASE (CSE), FCS-LIKE ZINC FINGER PROTEIN 13 (FLZ13), and DROUGHT-INDUCED 21 (DI21). Promoter analysis revealed that the CIPK6 promoter contains transcription factor binding motifs unique to the salt-tolerant accession, which may contribute to its high expression under salt stress.

While existing tools predicting substrate specificity of A-domain incorporate machine learning methods and specificity-conferring codes, they inadequately address substrate promiscuity and non-proteinogenic substrates. Recent advances in cross-modal contrastive learning combined with few-shot learning offer promising approaches to improved prediction of these complex pocket-substrate interactions. Here we present DeepAden, a novel two-stage ensemble tool that achieves state-of-the-art performance in substrate specificity prediction across multiple benchmarks. The framework first trains a graph attention network to identify A-domain binding pocket around substrate using fused sequence and structural features derived from a protein language model, then employs cross-modal contrastive learning to jointly encode pocket-substrate interactions through protein and chemical language model, effectively addressing both substrate promiscuity and zero-shot prediction challenges. Furthermore, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) strategy to serve dual purposes, which not only guides position-specific substitutions for data augmentation, but also enables systematic investigation of substrate-specific residues across characterized A-domains. XAI analysis revealed Cys-ABPs uniquely employ 18Gly and 20Ala, in contract to 18Tyr/20Pro in other ABPs, forming a flexible binding pocket that enables distinctive ligand orientation through altered hydrogen bonding networks and {pi}-{pi} stacking interactions.

However, modeling human behavior in such environments has been challenging. Deep Q-networks (DQNs), an application of deep learning used in reinforcement learning (RL), enable the investigation of how humans transform high-dimensional, time-continuous visual stimuli into appropriate motor responses. While recent advances in DQNs have led to significant performance improvements, it has remained unclear whether these advancements translate into improved modeling of human behavior. Here, we recorded motor responses in human participants (N=23) while playing three distinct arcade games. We used stimulus features generated by a DQN as predictors for human data by fitting the DQN's response probabilities to human motor responses using a linear model. We hypothesized that advancements in RL models would lead to better prediction of human motor responses. Therefore, we used features from two recently developed DQN models (Ape-X and SEED) and a third baseline DQN to compare prediction accuracy. Compared to the baseline DQN, Ape-X and SEED involved additional structures, such as dueling and double Q-learning, and a long short-term memory, which considerably improved their performances when playing arcade games. Since the experimental tasks were time-continuous, we also analyzed the effect of temporal resolution on prediction accuracy by smoothing the model and human data to varying degrees. We found that all three models predict human behavior significantly above chance level. SEED, the most complex model, outperformed the others in prediction accuracy of human behavior across all three games. These results suggest that advances in deep reinforcement learning can improve our capability to model human behavior in complex, time-continuous experimental tasks at a fine-grained temporal scale, thereby opening an interesting avenue for future research that complements the conventional experimental approach, characterized by its trial structure and use of low-dimensional stimuli.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Methods: Data were repurposed from a study where, following ethical approval, a control cohort (n=9) and a pathological cohort of patients with chronic unexplained nausea and vomiting (CUNV; n=8) underwent intra-operative high-resolution serosal electrical mapping (96-256 electrodes, 4.0-5.2 mm spacing). Slow waves were identified using validated software, and spatiotemporally averaged waveforms were compared between cohorts. These waveforms were replicated in a computational model of gastric slow-wave propagation to explore potential functional implications. Results: The slow-wave morphology of the CUNV cohort exhibited a more gradual recovery stroke compared to controls, which manifested as an increase in the normalized recovery stroke area [0.206 (95% CI: 0.169-0.247) vs. 0.134 (95% CI: 0.106-0.166); p=0.011]. Computational modeling showed that these morphological differences could drive spatial slow-wave dysrhythmias. Considering the evident functional importance of gastric slow-wave morphology, we highlighted the three typical morphological features: 1) rapid, brief upstroke, 2) downstroke, and 3) biphasic recovery stroke.

This reversal of typical sex roles is a peculiarity of the human species and has been the focus of extensive theoretical debate. Yet, it has never been systematically examined or empirically verified. Here, we present a comprehensive cross-cultural meta-analysis of same-sex and opposite-sex ratings of facial attractiveness from around the globe. Our findings confirm the existence of a robust \"Gender Attractiveness Gap\" (GAP), with female faces rated significantly more attractive than male faces across rater genders, cultural backgrounds, and portrayed ethnicities. Notably, the effect is more pronounced among female than male raters, suggesting gender-specific modulation. We show that approximately two-thirds of the GAP is mediated by structural facial sex-typicality. However, this mediation is asymmetric: controlling for facial dimorphism substantially reduces the attractiveness of female, but not male, faces, indicating a specific aesthetic preference for structural femininity by both male and female raters. This suggests that attractiveness judgments are driven by general aesthetic evaluation processes that extend beyond heterosexual mate choice. We also observe a general tendency for greater stringency among male raters. Overall, these findings contribute to evolutionary psychology and social perception, offering new insights into mate selection theories and underscoring the importance of accounting for gender-specific and cultural influences in attractiveness judgments.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Atg2, a lipid transfer protein (LTP), collaborates with the phosphoinositide-binding protein Atg18 in this process. However, it remains largely unknown how the Atg2-Atg18 complex achieves bulk lipid transport and how much it contributes to autophagosome biogenesis. Here, by combining in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches, we explored the possibility that Atg2 mediates a bridge-type lipid transfer mechanism. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on the AlphaFold-predicted structure of the Atg2-Atg18 complex indicate that the hydrophobic cavity of Atg2 accommodates ~25 phospholipids in a water-excluding arrangement, aligning them side-by-side while maintaining bilayer-like fluidity. During simulations, Atg2 continuously bridged two membranes via its two termini and transferred a cavity-resident phospholipid to a membrane, contingent on Atg18-phosphoinositide interactions. Importantly, narrowing the cavity on the way disrupted side-by-side lipid alignment in silico, impaired bridge-type lipid transfer in vitro, and inhibited autophagosomal membrane expansion in vivo.

Upon internalization into host cells, Coxiella extensively remodels host vesicle trafficking and replicates within acidic, lysosome-derived, spacious vacuoles by secreting a suite of effectors through the type IVB secretion system (T4BSS), and hijacking the host cell machinery. However, how fundamental lysosomal functions, such as exocytosis, are subverted during Coxiella infection has not been well understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the regulation and role of exocytosis in the context of Coxiella infection. Biochemical and fluorescence-based imaging approaches indicated that C. burnetii infection promotes release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Increase in extracellular levels of endolysosomal proteins (LAMP1 and cathepsin D) and surface LAMP1 expression were identified in both phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, during later stages of infection. Interestingly, infection-induced exocytosis was dependent on the activity of the bacterial T4BSS. Modulating the activity of TRPML1, a host calcium channel that induces exocytosis by regulating the release of calcium from lysosomes into the cytosol, using synthetic agonist/antagonist, led to a decrease in intracellular C. burnetii replication, suggesting a complex, tightly regulated role of TRPML1 during infection.

Vps1 has been found to associate with tubular endosomes undergoing severing, implying a role in membrane fission. Current biochemical and structural analyses of Vps1 however seem to indicate that it is not sufficient for fission. Here, we analyze Vps1 functions using cell-free reconstitution, live cell imaging and proteomics of isolated yeast vacuoles. We find that the endosomal lipid phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) stabilizes Vps1 to form protein scaffolds around tubular membrane substrates. GTP hydrolysis forces constriction of tubules to a critical ~7 nm radius, ultimately causing their fission. Furthermore, we discover that the Insert B (InsB) in Vps1 harbor conserved lysine rich (3K) lipid-binding and phenylalanine-rich (4F) self assembly motifs. Mutating these motifs renders Vps1 incapable of membrane fission and abrogates its functions in endosomal protein sorting. Quantitative vacuolar proteomic analysis reveals that loss of Vps1 results in the enrichment of a small set of proteins, most of which represent retromer cargo while causing depletion of the bulk of proteins in the vacuole. Vps1 functions in endosomal protein sorting are therefore critical for the global regulation of the vacuole proteome.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

However, the effect of GTP hydrolysis on the curving dynamics of microtubule tips remains incompletely understood. In this study, we employed a multiscale modeling approach, combining all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with Brownian dynamics simulations, to investigate the relaxation of microtubule plus-end tips into curved configurations.

These observations align with experimental cryo-ET images of microtubule plus-end tips in different nucleotide states. Collectively, our findings suggest that the outward bending of protofilaments at the plus-end tip is an intrinsic feature of microtubules, independent of the nucleotide state.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

As well as porting many of the analyses previously available but relatively inaccessible in our Phaser codebase, Xtricorder offers a likelihood-enhanced self-rotation function. A novel and intuitive graphical representation of the self-rotation function presents the results for user inspection, and has the added advantage that, in an adapted form, is appropriate for training a convolutional neural network to enhance the standard Matthews analysis and more accurately predict the number of copies in the asymmetric unit. We investigate the usefulness of the likelihood-enhanced self-rotation function in \"first look\" analyses, exploring the circumstances under which the self-rotation function results are useful, and discuss the application to AI-generated structure prediction.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we use prime editing (PE) to install heterozygous edits in over ten distinct genetic loci, achieving knock-in efficiencies of up to 40% without the need for subsequent purification or drug selection steps. Moreover, PE enables the precise introduction of heterozygous edits in paralogous genes that are otherwise extremely challenging to achieve using endonuclease-based editing approaches. We also show that PE can be successfully combined with reprogramming to derive heterozygous iPSC clones directly from human fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our findings highlight the utility of PE for generating hPSCs with complex edits and represents a powerful platform for modelling disease-associated dominant mutations and gene-dosage effects in an entirely isogenic context.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Here we employ comprehensive epigenetic profiling in specific neuronal and glial cell types from the human striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of control and HD donor samples to identify cell type- and species-specific transcriptional control mechanisms in the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MSH3 and FAN1 that can explain the specificity of somatic CAG expansion in the first stage of HD.

In rod photoreceptor cells of the retina, these structures include elongated mitochondria in the inner segments and a distinct, large, circular mitochondrion in each presynaptic terminal. The mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of these specialized mitochondrial morphologies, along with their functional significance, are not well understood. Here, we investigate the roles of mitochondrial fusion proteins mitofusin 1 (MFN1) and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) in shaping these structures and maintaining photoreceptor cell health. Rod photoreceptor cell-specific ablation of MFN1 and MFN2 resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation by one month of age, suggesting that mitochondrial fusion is essential for the development of photoreceptor cell-specific mitochondrial structures. Notably, the layer structures of the retina examined by light microscopy appeared unaffected at this age. Following this time period, significant photoreceptor cell degeneration occurred by three months of age. Furthermore, we showed that impaired mitochondrial fusion perturbed the balance of proteins involved in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and {beta}-oxidation, highlighting the critical role of mitochondrial fusion in ensuring the proper levels of proteins necessary for optimal energy metabolism. Additionally, we identified upregulation of cellular stress pathways such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR), which arise in response to energy deprivation, and cytoprotective biosynthetic pathways mediated by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein gamma (C/EBP{gamma}) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling.

Here, we present StringTie3, a major update to the widely used StringTie assembler, specifically designed for total RNA-seq. This new version introduces two key innovations: (1) a nascent mode that models co-transcriptional splicing to separate nascent from mature transcripts, and (2) a refined long-read module that distinguishes genuine polyadenylation sites from poly(A)-priming artifacts. Across short-, long-, and hybrid-read datasets, StringTie3 substantially reduces assembly errors and outperforms existing tools, boosting precision by up to 20% in short-read total RNA-seq and improving sensitivity and precision by as much as 37% and 75%, respectively, in long-read assemblies. In Argonaute knockout experiments, nascent-mode analysis shows that single knockouts predominantly alter nascent transcripts while leaving mature RNA largely unchanged, whereas double or triple knockouts disrupt both fractions. Applying this approach to breast cancer samples shows that, although nascent and mature RNA levels often correlate, certain extracellular matrix and tumor suppressor genes deviate from this pattern, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. By accurately reconstructing transcriptomes and distinguishing nascent from mature RNA, StringTie3 reveals hidden layers of RNA regulation and provides a powerful framework for investigating transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in total RNA-seq data.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Methods We collected 5014 dried blood spots from Plasmodium falciparum infected patients from 413 malaria posts, over 58-months (November 2015 - August 2020), and sequenced 2270 parasite genomes, each with geographic references (latitude and longitude). We used identity-by-descent (IBD) relationships to examine how control efforts impact parasite population structure. Findings Parasites were genetically depauperate: 1726 single-genotype infections comprised 166 unique genomes ([&ge;]90% IBD), while nine families ([&ge;]45% IBD) accounted for 62.5% of parasites sampled. We observed localized, temporally stable transmission of unique parasite genotypes, identifying transmission chains. Parasite relatedness was positively correlated up to approximately 20 km revealing the scale of parasite subpopulations. Kelch13 diversity was stable from 2016-2019, but only one predominant clonal genotype (kelch13-R561H) remained in 2020. MDA resulted in parasite founder effects, providing genomic evidence for the efficacy of this malaria control tool. Interpretation Our genomic data show that parasite population size decreased over the study period, and we observed regional distribution of parasite genotypes, which can define operational units for parasite control. One parasite genotype (kelch13-R561H) from the north rose to high frequency in 2020, because transmission was halted elsewhere in the control area. Future surveillance will reveal whether this genotype spreads to neighboring regions. Genetic drift may have a stronger impact on parasite population structure than selection in low-transmission elimination settings.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Carprofen and buprenorphine are two common analgesics used for laboratory mice (Mus musculus). However, given the potential gastrointestinal side effects that these analgesics have in various species, the impact of these analgesics on mice used in metabolic studies could be concerning. To investigate the impact of carprofen and sustained-release buprenorphine on food consumption, activity level, and whole-body metabolism, we administered carprofen alone or in combination with sustained-release buprenorphine to mice that underwent jugular vein and carotid artery catheterization, or a sham surgery. The mice were individually housed in instrumented metabolic cages to continuously quantify food consumption, activity levels, and energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry. We hypothesized that catheterized mice receiving both carprofen and sustained-release buprenorphine would have decreased food consumption and increased activity level compared to mice that received sham surgery and carprofen, and catheterized mice treated with carprofen only would have similar food consumption and activity level as sham mice that received carprofen. Our results demonstrate that during the initial 12h after surgery, catheterized mice that received both carprofen and sustained-release buprenorphine were more active than sham mice that received carprofen, and were more active and consumed more food than catheterized mice that received carprofen only. Our study demonstrated how analgesia regimen can affect metabolic parameters.

In previous work, we characterized the ASB9-Cullin 5 E3 ligase (ASB9-CRL) ubiquitylation of creatine kinase and showed that ubiquitylation required the ring-between-ring ligase, ARIH2. Here we characterize the ASB9-CRL ubiquitylation of histones and show that histones H3 and H4 are polyubiquitylated by the ASB9-CRL whereas histones H2A and H2B are not. Many, but not all lysines in the histones are ubiquitylated suggesting some substrate specificity. Binding experiments show that the ligase-histone interaction is highly electrostatic and the neddylated ASB9-CRL binds with highest affinity. Only free histones are ubiquitylated. When the histones are in nucleosomes or in complex with the chaperone Asf1, they are not ubiquitylated. Only K48 and K63 polyubiquitin chains were observed, suggesting that the ubiquitylation probably drives protein degradation. The presence of ASB9 in specific cell types correlates with situations in which free histones H3 and H4 need to be degraded. In this work, we demonstrate that the ASB9-CRL is the ligase that facilitates degradation of histones H3 and H4. In addition, this work represents the first example of Cullin 5 mediated ubiquitylation that does not require an additional ring-between-ring ligase.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Here, I introduce OptiK, a novel alignment-free tool that evaluates the information richness of k-mer encodings across a range of k values to identify the optimal k for comparative analysis. OptiK operates by constructing k-mer frequency matrices from genome collections, reducing their dimensionality via truncated singular value decomposition (SVD), and evaluating clustering structure through unsupervised metrics including the Silhouette coefficient, Calinski-Harabasz index, and Davies-Bouldin index. We validate OptiK on a curated dataset of 1044 Helicobacter pylori genomes with well-characterized population structure. OptiK robustly identifies k = 8 as the optimal k-mer size, yielding latent structures in UMAP space that align with fineSTRUCTURE-defined subpopulations without relying on prior labels or reference alignments.

In the in vitro model, HT-29 cells were pretreated with two selected doses of T. obliquus (Mi175.B1.a) extract for 72 hours prior to stress induction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Parameters assessed included gene expression, paracellular permeability, and immunomodulatory properties.

However, interpreting these models remains challenging, raising questions about the generalizability of inferred sequence functions. Cross-species prediction of transcription factor (TF) binding offers a promising approach to enhance model generalization by leveraging sequence variation across species, and it can contribute to the discovery of a conserved gene-regulatory code. However, addressing systematic differences between the genomes of various species is a significant challenge. Results: We introduce MORALE, a framework that utilizes a well-established domain adaptation approach that is \"frustratingly easy.\" MORALE trains on sequences from one or more source species and predicts TF binding on a single target species where no binding data is available. To learn an invariant cross-species sequence representation, MORALE aligns the first and second moments of the data-generating distribution between all species. This direct approach integrates easily into representation learning models with an embedding layer. Unlike alternatives such as adversarial learning, it does not require additional parameters or other model design choices. We apply MORALE to two ChIP-seq datasets of liver-essential TFs: one comprising human and mouse, and another comprising five mammalian species. Compared to both a baseline and an adversarial approach termed gradient reversal (GRL), MORALE demonstrates improved performance across all TFs in the two-species case. Importantly, it avoids a performance degradation observed with the GRL approach in this study. Furthermore, feature attribution revealed that important motifs discovered by MORALE were closer to the actual TF binding motif compared with the GRL approach. For the five-species case, our method significantly improved TF binding site prediction for all TFs when predicting on human data, surpassing the performance of a human-only model -- a result not observed in the two-species comparison. Overall, MORALE is a direct and competitive approach that leverages domain adaptation techniques to improve cross-species TF binding site prediction.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Diagnoses are rendered by microscopical examination of two-dimensional sections. Good clinical practice requires that samples be retained for decades, thus giving rise to enormous archives of healthy and diseased human tissues. Tissue-clearing technologies and whole-mount microscopy would enable 3D analyses, but whole FFPE tissue blocks are often unsuitable for clearing due to their size, their extensive covalent cross-linking, and their embedding in solid wax. Here, we present archival DISCO (aDISCO), a versatile and robust clearing method for whole-mount archival FFPE human tissue blocks. aDISCO enabled complete clearing and consistent antibody staining of samples stored for at least 15 years. We show that aDISCO can be applied to human brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, skin, muscle, heart, kidney, liver, spleen, colon, and lung, and is compatible with a wide range of commonly used antibodies. We applied aDISCO to the 3D study of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a neurodevelopmental disease associated with epilepsy. We performed deep-learning-based-segmentation and object detection to identify both focal and global neuronal density variations in FCD and to precisely quantify the disruption of cortical layering, features that are likely to be overlooked by conventional histology. When combined with selective-plane illumination microscopy, aDISCO delivers natively digital data suitable for deep-learning-based processing, thus enabling the detection of subtle and sparse pathologies in large archival human tissue specimens.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

Although ephaptic coupling is deemed to contribute to computations in the brain, the olfactory system, the retina, and to cardiac conduction, and being associated with diseases like epilepsy and arrhythmia, it is still poorly understood since it is notoriously difficult to investigate in vivo and in vitro. In vitro electrophysiology allows accessible and flexible experimentation, but circuits form randomly, leading to a lack of precision and reproducibility. Here, we present a method for reproducibly constructing human neuronal networks in vitro with single-cell precision. We constructed neuronal circuits from the bottom up by bringing their axons into close contact. This enabled us to measure the effects of ephaptic coupling and validate theoretical predictions, such as reduced action potential velocity, increased activity synchronization and reduced stimulation threshold. Our precise measurements of electrophysiological activity support the importance of ephaptic coupling in neuronal circuit function.

Genes that exhibit significant variation across different cell types or states are typically closely linked to cellular functional states and disease processes.

CSFeatures effectively addresses this issue by comprehensively considering the expression level, the smoothness of expression distribution, and the proportion of gene expression in the target cell population as well as in each of the other cell populations. Through comprehensive experiments on eight single-cell RNA-seq datasets, it was demonstrated that CSFeatures can effectively identify cell type-specific genes that are highly expressed in the target cell population while being lowly expressed in all other populations. Moreover, it was validated that the underlying principle of CSFeatures can be generalized to other omics data, including single-cell ATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial ATAC-seq data. Furthermore, the differential features identified by CSFeatures are enriched in pathways, functional categories, and regulatory regions that are highly relevant to the specific functional states of the target cell population, providing insights into its gene regulation.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

By performing inverse mathematical analysis of substrate deformations induced by cellular forces, it is possible to estimate the underlying traction forces.

However, it is well known that the accuracy of force estimation deteriorates when the observation density is low. Furthermore, standardized datasets have not been established, as validation settings-such as random force distributions on the substrate, cell size, and bead density-vary across studies. To enable quantitative evaluation, we constructed a dataset based on the biophysical mechanism by which cellular traction forces are transmitted to the substrate through stress fibers, clutch proteins, and focal adhesions.

From three clusters of variable exons directing homophilic interactions, one single exon is selected. Homophilic repulsion of identical isoforms directs branching of axons running in neuronal tracts, and of dendrites for generation of overlapping dendritic fields through selection of different variables in neighbouring cells. Here, we investigate the spatial inclusion of Dscam variable alternative exons in Drosophila and honey bees using reporter genes and in situ hybridizations, respectively. In Drosophila, we find that Dscam variable clusters 4 and 9 splicing is not always productive in reporters, resulting in suppressed expression in optic lobes and variable expression across identical cells in salivary glands and photoreceptor fields. However, in photoreceptor neurons, we find repetitive inclusion of specific variables suggesting that stochastic expression is generated at the level of splicing of the variable cluster, but inclusion of variables follows a deterministic path. Likewise, we find in larval brains, inclusion of exon 4 and 9 variables in compartmentalised and repetitive patterns. In foraging honey bees, inclusion of exon 4 and 10 variables occurs in compartmentalized patterns differing between mushroom body lobes and individuals. This indicates that initial equal inclusion of variables is directed to compartmentalized inclusion through experience.

An unbiased large-scale bacterial two-hybrid screen identified 54 IbsA-interacting targets, including proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and cell division. Among these, IbsA toxin specifically targets two subunits of the bacterial FoF1 ATP synthase. IbsA interacts with the a and b subunits in the membrane-bound Fo sector and inhibits proton translocation, thereby decreasing ATP levels. In turn, this IbsA-mediated decrease facilitates Salmonella spread between macrophages, promoting systemic infection. Accordingly, ibsA deletion decreases bacterial burden in organs and attenuates mouse virulence. Therefore, unlike other bacterial toxins, the IbsA toxin enhances Salmonella pathogenicity by decreasing the bacterium's ATP levels.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}

In glucose-limited niches, it utilizes alternative carbon sources such as carboxylic acids, which may influence its pathogenicity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the uptake of monocarboxylates occurs through regulated plasma membrane (PM) transport proteins, such as Ato1 (Ady2), which belongs to the Acetate Uptake Transporter (AceTr) family. In C. albicans, these proteins are notably expanded, consisting of ten Ato-like proteins (ATO1-ATO10), whose functions remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of Ato proteins in carboxylic acid utilization by C. albicans using in-silico and functional analysis. Our data revealed that several C. albicans Atos retain conserved AceTr motifs but possess distinct structural features, including differences in pore radius and binding sites for acetate and lactate. Expression analysis revealed that Ato1, Ato2, Ato3, and Ato6 exhibit distinct cellular localization and expression levels on the plasma membrane, depending on the presence or absence of monocarboxylates. Remarkably, deletion of ATO1 impaired ATO2 and ATO3 expression and caused ER retention of a distinct form of Ato2, suggesting a central regulatory role for Ato1 in the Ato transport system. Finally, we identified a novel Ato-related protein family in vertebrates. This family has three consecutive 6-helix transport domains and a unique C-terminal fusion with Sua5/YciO/YrdC, an enzyme involved in tRNA modification. Overall, our data suggests that the Ato protein family might play a critical role in the utilization of acetic or lactic acids in C. albicans.

Beyond the bloodstream, T. brucei also occupies extravascular, adipose-rich tissues such as the skin, a potential reservoir for transmission. Here, we identify an alternative slender-to-stumpy differentiation pathway driven by glycerol, a host metabolite abundant in adipose-rich tissues, that could resolve the long-standing paradox of successful parasite transmission from human hosts during chronic infection despite low parasitaemia. We show that high (10 mM) and non-physiological glycerol concentrations under low glucose conditions (0.5 mM) induce differentiation, generating distinct stumpy-Glyc forms that resemble stumpy-QS parasites but have an extended lifespan. Under conditions mimicking dermal tissue interstitial fluids (4 mM glucose, 0.25 mM glycerol), we show that glycerol promotes the emergence of proliferative intermediate forms that retain transmission potential and can differentiate into fly host-specific procyclic forms in vitro and within tsetse flies. These findings open the door for reevaluation of the model of T. brucei transmission and supports a dominant role for adipocyte-derived glycerol in the skin in sustaining parasite transmission.", "date": "2025-05-26", "journal": ""}
