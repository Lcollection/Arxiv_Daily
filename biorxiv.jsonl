In the mammalian visual system, individual retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons form clustered terminal boutons containing multiple active zones onto relay cell dendrites in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). This mature architecture arises through the addition of release sites, which strengthens selected afferents while weaker inputs are pruned. Following eye-opening, spontaneous activity and visual experience promote synaptic refinement and bouton clustering after binocular inputs have segregated. However, anatomical changes in release site addition and spatial patterning during earlier stages of eye-specific competition are not well understood. To investigate this, we examined the spatial organization of eye-specific active zones in wild type mice and a mutant line with disrupted cholinergic retinal waves. Using volumetric super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy and electron microscopy, we found that individual retinogeniculate boutons begin forming multiple nearby presynaptic active zones during the first postnatal week. Both eyes generate these \"multi-active-zone\" (mAZ) inputs throughout refinement, but the dominant-eye forms more numerous mAZ contacts, each with more active zones and larger vesicle pools. At the height of competition (postnatal day 4), the non-dominant-eye projection adds many single active zone (sAZ) synapses. Mutants with abnormal cholinergic retinal waves still form mAZ inputs, but develop fewer synapses overall and show reduced synaptic clustering in projections from both eyes. Together, these findings reveal eye-specific differences in release site addition that correlate with axonal refinement outcomes during retinogeniculate refinement.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

However, it is not a simple task to combine such information as they are derived usually in very different ways with functional information typically gathered using fMRI, EEG, or MEG whereas structural information relies on robust diffusion-weighted MRI tractography methods. This work proposes a solution to this problem using an analogy to an electric circuit with the functional information being the voltage sources and the structural information resistance of the elements in the circuit. The voltage sources and resistances can be used to solve the current in the circuit using Modified Nodal Analysis, for example. In the proposed analogy, the solved electric current represents how the functional information flows in the structural brain network. This work demonstrates a connection-specific example of such analysis as well as whole-brain analysis using data from the Human Connectome Project. Another dataset of functional and structural data from healthy brains is used to demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to study the aging of the human brain. The main motivation for the proposed analysis method is that it could provide new information on various conditions and diseases such as Alzheimer's that affect the human brain. In a sense, the proposed functio-structural current (FSC) analysis is a macro-scale version of the classical Hodkin-Huxley model.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

In our case study on the Pyrenean brown bear population, two \"outliers\" individuals were detected more often over very large spatial extent compared to other individuals. The integration of such individuals made SCR modelling challenging, especially since it remains unclear how unmodelled heterogeneity in space use may bias connectivity and population size estimates. To address this gap, we used simulations reflecting the Pyrenean brown bear population, with two groups of individuals differing in their space use due to individual characteristics but also in their spatial responses to landscape structure. We compared six SCR model formulations that varied in whether individual and spatial heterogeneity in space use were (1) ignored, (2) explicitly modelled, or (3) handled by removing outliers. We then applied the same models to the empirical bear dataset. By combining simulations and sensitivity analyses, we highlight the challenges of choosing the appropriate modelling approach when multiple sources of heterogeneity in space use occur simultaneously. Our results show that the treatment of heterogeneity in space use should match the research objective: removing outliers supports accurate population size estimation, while explicitly modelling heterogeneity is essential for reliable connectivity assessment. Overall, we provide a practical framework for identifying and addressing heterogeneity in SCR applications, to guide practitioners in deciding when additional model complexity is warranted.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Although all three species had similar strategies, we found that both primate species -- humans and monkeys -- were able to persist in exploitation for longer than the mice.

Psi sites identified by nanopore sequencing were cross-validated using Illumina-based methods, confirming both positional accuracy and reproducibility. Unlike prior short-read approaches, nanopore sequencing provided the unique ability to quantify relative occupancy at each site and to detect multiple modifications on the same RNA molecule, revealing combinatorial modification patterns that cannot be captured otherwise. Integrating these psi maps with matched proteomic and ribosome profiling datasets, we find that psi modulates translation through two mechanistic modes: (i) single high-occupancy psi sites enhance translational efficiency and protein output, whereas (ii) clustered psi modifications promote ribosome pausing, decoupling translation efficiency from protein yield. This integrative, multi-omics framework provides a quantitative model of how psi stoichiometry and distribution along transcripts shape ribosome dynamics and proteome composition across human cell types.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a post-transcriptional mechanism that times the expression of the splicing factor Rbfox2 during neurogenesis. RBFOX2 is normally expressed at low levels in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and becomes upregulated in newborn neurons where it promotes neuronal differentiation. Unexpectedly, premature expression of Rbfox2 in NPCs of the embryonic mouse neocortex blocked their differentiation into neurons rather than promoting it. Genome-wide analysis revealed widespread alternative splicing changes enriched for NDD genes and associated with a hybrid NPC- and neuron-like splicing pattern that significantly deviates from the normal splicing developmental trajectory. Remarkably, premature Rbfox2 expression induced the inclusion of validated target exons that are otherwise repressed by PTBP2 pointing to an antagonistic splicing relationship. Integrative scRNA-seq analysis confirmed a negatively correlated expression between these two RNA-binding proteins (RBP) along differentiation pseudotime. Strikingly, we identified the NPC-specific miRNA 92a-3p as a regulator of the Rbfox2 expression switch: expression of miR-92a reduced RBFOX2 levels and reversed splicing patterns of target genes in vitro, while silencing miR-92a in vivo increased RBFOX2 expression in the embryonic cortex. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized miRNA-RBP regulatory axis that ensures the proper timing of NPC-to-neuron splicing transitions in the developing cortex and provide new insights into splicing dysregulation as a contributing factor to the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Under baseline conditions, spontaneous tail flips dynamically align with saccades in frequency and direction for coordinated turns. Chemosensory valence further modulates this coordination: death-associated cues intensify both the strength and frequency of coupled saccade-tail flips during turns, whereas food-related cues promote forward gliding without altering saccade coupling. Concurrent brain-wide neuronal imaging reveals that the zebrafish pallium represents the transformation of aversive valence into enhanced saccade-tail coordination, with stronger coupling associated with higher pallium activation.

Tau polymers in vitro were examined using atomic force microscopy imaging to compare tau filament lengths and morphologies.

We observed that the R5L mutation has a greater impact on filament length in shorter N-terminal isoforms of tau, whereas in longer N-terminal isoforms the mutation impacts the total amount of tau aggregation.

We employ theory and simulation to describe how membrane surfaces accelerate filament assembly via clustering of proteins that bind actin monomers and/or profilin-actin complexes. Briefly, thermal fluctuations drive filament tips on constrained, two-dimensional random walks across the membrane, where they encounter multiple actin-charged polymerases. At low actin concentrations, filament elongation is limited by delivery of monomers to the membrane surface; at high actin concentrations, elongation depends on how quickly fluctuating filaments search the membrane. Using experimentally measured parameter values we conclude that surface-mediated polymerization can outpace solution-mediated elongation, even at high actin concentrations (>200 M). The finite time required for profilin dissociation decreases the advantage conferred by surface-associated polymerases, but only in the absence of force. Load forces enhance the effect of surface polymerases, which can both accelerate elongation and increase the force required to stall filament assembly.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Many heuristic MSA algorithms use guide trees to determine sequence alignment order, but finding an optimal guide tree is an NP-hard problem. Conventional guide tree algorithms are greedy heuristics designed for better scalability at the cost of accuracy. By utilizing quantum algorithms, such as quantum annealing, we can overcome the problem of local minima that occurs in greedy methods. We propose a scalable guide tree algorithm that achieves scalability through quantum annealing. The theoretical foundations of our method are both minimum evolution and molecular clock. Unlike classical greedy approaches, we directly map the minimum evolution problem to a traveling salesperson problem (TSP), which quantum annealing can solve efficiently. The TSP solution enables the guide tree to be constructed in linear time using the molecular clock. Even with only a single sample from a D-Wave hybrid solver, our guide tree generally performed comparably to classical trees on the BAliBASE 3.0 benchmark. With a single iterative refinement, no statistically significant performance differences were found between our method and classical guide trees. Our scalable guide tree algorithm is practical in the sense that only a single sampling can be enough for constructing a good guide tree. Further performance analysis requires larger-scale benchmark tests. Fortunately, rapid advances in quantum hardware may soon enable these tests.

Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses reveal that these mutant diets induce oxidative stress and activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Antioxidant supplementation abolishes lifespan extension, confirming that oxidative stress drives these effects. The extension of lifespan requires the oxidative stress response regulators SKN-1, SEK-1, and HLH-30. Mechanistically, these effects are linked to reduced iron availability, as iron supplementation restores FAT-7 expression, suppresses UPRmt activation, and abolishes lifespan extension.

Extending fULM into three dimensions (3D) further exacerbates these challenges because of low-frequency matrix arrays, reduced localization efficiency, and severe data sparsity. To address these limitations, we developed a statistical framework that models MB arrivals in 3D as a Poisson process accounting for localization efficiency, detection probability, and backscattered amplitude. This analysis predicts that integrating amplitude with count-based fULM improves functional sensitivity, particularly under high MB concentrations where localization saturates. Three-dimensional MB advection simulations confirmed these predictions, showing that backscattering fULM (B-fULM) maintains sensitivity at higher MB concentrations where conventional fULM fails. In rat brain experiments, B-fULM yielded stronger and more robust stimulus-evoked responses, with SNR gains of 18% in the somatosensory cortex and 61% in the thalamus, while preserving super-resolved spatial detail (33.4 m for B-fULM vs 35.7 m for fULM).

By integrating molecular imaging, and neuroimaging datasets, we provide converging evidence that the spatial distribution of diverse cell types, neurotransmitter systems, and mitochondrial phenotypes is systematically associated with brain entropy. We found significant differences in entropy correlations between normal controls and individuals with schizophrenia for the mu-opioid receptor and dopamine receptor (D1), and between normal controls and bipolar disorder for the norepinephrine transporter (NAT) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA). No significant differences were observed between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the neurotransmitter domain.

From this foundation, we derive two further metrics: the edge centrality, which identifies contacts critical for global connectivity by measuring their recurrence across all possible communication pathways, and the entropy sensitivity, which quantifies how perturbations to specific interactions alter system-wide flexibility. The mathematical structure shows that both topological centrality and thermodynamic sensitivity are linear functions of the dynamic distance. This derived unification demonstrates that residue pairs with high dynamic dissimilarity simultaneously function as flexible bottlenecks essential for allosteric communication. Applied to the oncoprotein KRAS, all three measures converge to identify the same residue pairs, corresponding to experimentally known allosteric sites. This convergence provides a unified graph-theoretical explanation for their functional importance. Analysis of the G12D mutation and adagrasib binding shows how local perturbations rewire global communication pathways, highlighting specific residue pairs that gain or lose importance as network bottlenecks.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Feature-Mask-Based Strategies for Subtype-Specific Freezing of Gait Detection using CNNs", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.26.656145", "authors": "Yu, X.; Martens, K. E.; Arami, A.", "abstract": "Objective: Freezing of gait (FOG), a disabling symptom of Parkinson's disease, varies in manifestations and motion contexts. Its heterogeneity motivates subtype categorization such as manifestation-specific subtypes (akinesia, trembling or shuffling) or motion-specific subtypes (gait-initiation, walking or turning). Despite numerous promising deep learning FOG detection studies, few consider FOG heterogeneity. It remains unclear whether different subtypes require distinct detection strategies, and whether tailoring subtype-specific models could enhance detection generalizability across subtypes. Methods: To address these questions, we categorize FOG data into manifestation- or motion-specific subtypes and derive their corresponding detection strategies as interpretable feature masks. We then propose a feature-mask-based CNN that explicitly embeds the identified strategies. Using waist-mounted 3D accelerometer data, a general CNN and subtype-specific CNNs are trained. Results: According to feature-mask analysis, motion-specific subtypes share a common detection strategy, whereas manifestation-specific subtypes require distinct strategies. Manifestation models exhibit enhanced generalizability across subtypes compared to the general model, boosting the overall average FOG detection sensitivity by 24.95%+/-9.80% and specificity by 18.29%+/-8.71%. Conversely, motion models reduce the overall FOG sensitivity by 1.89%+/-8.74% and specificity by 5.17%+/-10.76%. Conclusions: The detection strategy is mainly driven by manifestation composition of the data. The general model favors the dominant manifestation-specific subtype group(s), a bias corrected by tailored manifestation-specific strategies. No comparable benefit arises from motion models due to their similar manifestation compositions. Significance: This study interpretably reveals the detection strategies required by different FOG subtypes and demonstrates the effectiveness of subtype-specific tailoring in improving FOG detection generalizability.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Little is known about repair of pathways/circuits after traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in disruption of connectivity. Here we utilize a mouse model of diffuse traumatic axonal injury (Impact-acceleration TBI) in order to explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and synapses were genetically labeled via AAV transduction, while anterograde and transsynaptic tracers were used to mark terminals and postsynaptic cells. Functional connectivity and visual integrity were assessed by monitoring c-Fos expression following light stimulation and pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (pVEPs). Our findings demonstrate that, although TAI results in approximately a 50% loss of RGC axons and terminals, surviving RGCs undergo collateral sprouting, a form of compensatory branching of surviving axons, that restores terminal density to pre-injury levels. Transsynaptic tracing and c-Fos mapping confirmed the reestablishment of connectivity, which was also associated with significant improvements in visual function as measured by pVEPs. Interestingly, the recovery process exhibited sexual dimorphism, with female mice showing delayed or incomplete repair. Moreover, collateral sprouting proceeded normally in Sarm1 knockout mice, evidence of some independence from Wallerian degeneration. Our findings show that collateral sprouting may be an important mechanism of circuit repair in TAI and may represent a promising target for therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we tested the effect of transgenic overexpression of LCMT-1 or PME-1 on cognitive and electrophysiological impairments caused by exposure to either recombinant oligomeric human tau or oligomeric tau prepared from mice subjected to blast-induced traumatic brain injury. We found that overexpression of LCMT-1 reduced sensitivity to tau-induced impairments, while overexpression of PME-1 increased sensitivity to these impairments.

To investigate the time deception effect on fatigue, we developed a novel EEG design in which participants performed 100 isometric contractions at a fixed pace and resistance per session. The actual contraction duration (short or long) and the calibration of the displayed clock (normal or biased to an acceleration or deceleration) were independently manipulated between sessions to examine whether fatigue and its neural correlates evolved based on perceived or actual time. Our results show an accumulation of physical fatigue that follows the perceived time, irrespective of motivational factors. This effect was consistently observed only when the clock was slowed down. This time deception effect was mediated by an oscillatory dynamic that followed perceived time in frontal (theta- and beta-bands) but not motor areas (beta-band).

M.; Abdel-Moneim, M.

This investigation was undertaken to determine the effect of shifting sowing date on a cohort of six high yielding spring wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.), by delaying sowing date 15 and 30 days in a two-year field trial, aiming to highlight agronomic traits contributing to sustained yield potential under heat stress induced by late sowing, with a focus on identifying tolerant cultivars. Heat stress during anthesis reduced grain set and yield by up to 42%, mainly via reduced grain number per spike and thousand grain weight Late sowing shifted the timing of heat stress, resulting in floral abortion and significantly reduced number of grains/spike. More importantly, some cultivars showed up to 10% significant reduction in thousand grain weight (TGW) following delaying sowing date by 30 days, together with the TGW strong correlation with yield especially at late sowing (r=0.74), imposing the yield penalty in the heat stressed late sowing conditions. Among the cohort of tested cultivars, Sids12 and Misr1 cultivars showed minimal yield reduction (10-14%) due to 30 days delayed sowing in the second season highlighted with hot spring. On the contrary, harvest index of sowing delayed by 30 days was significantly higher compared to both 15 days late sowing and the optimum sowing date, suggesting that decline in biological yield exceeded that of grain yield. Upon shifting sowing date, the strength of traits association is altered, grain yield associations showed the strongest positive correlation in the 30 days late sowing with plant height (r=0.86), in the 15 days late sowing with number of total tillers/m2 (r=0.63) and in optimum sowing date with biological yield (r= 0.62), suggesting that grain yield enhancement through selected traits with direct or indirect contributions should be evaluated independently across different growing conditions.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health concern that demands effective patient monitoring to mitigate secondary complications and improve recovery. TBI increases the risk for neurodegeneration by destabilizing proteostasis that increases protein degradation and proteinopathy. Despite the clinical importance of noninvasive TBI biomarkers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), their mechanistic and cytological underpinnings remain poorly understood, hence are addressed here. Methods: Deep proteomic profiling of GFAP used mass spectrometry (MS) sequencing of immunopurified GFAP breakdown products (BDPs) in TBI patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. A unique trauma culture model used human neocortical astrocytes for GFAP epitope mapping and GFAP-BDP compartmental localization. Immunofluorescence, protease inhibitors (calpeptin, ZVAD-FMK), and live protease reporters document GFAP proteolysis and citrullination in dye-uptake-identified membrane-wounded astrocytes. Temporal profiles of GFAP and GFAP-BDPs were measured in TBI patients CSF via calibrated, sub-saturated immunoblot densitometry. Fragment-specific prediction of six-month recovery used the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE). Results: GFAP-BDP sequence sets with mapped posttranslational modifications (PTMs, citrullinations and acetylations) were identified in TBI patients biofluids. Citrullinated GFAP profiles were distinct from unmodified GFAP in TBI patients CSF. Novel TBI-specific cleavage fragments differed from those of Alzheimers and Alexander diseases. Antibody mapping in the culture trauma model confirmed GFAP-BDPs, identified a new trauma cleavage region and revealed GFAP rod-domain harbored coil1-BDPs were selectively released into fluids, while coil2-BDPs remained as intracellular aggregates. Citrullinated coil2-BDPs formed non-filamentous aggregates in dystrophic astrocytes. Calpains and caspases contributed to trauma-generated GFAP-BDPs that were active in distinct astrocyte morphotypes and injury states. TBI patient GFAP proteolysis trajectories show that full-length GFAP and 45-49kDa fragments peaked acutely, then declined, whereas calpain-generated 37-39kDa BDPs remained elevated. Small GFAP-BDP-levels were imbalanced from expected proportions, with 20-26kDa products exceeding 15-19kDa products in CSF, consistent with preferential coil1-BDP release and coil2 retention shown in vitro. GFAP fragment profiles, but not those of uncleaved GFAP, predicted good versus poor outcome of TBI patients. Conclusion: These findings highlight the translational importance of novel proteomic GFAP proteolysis profiles that could serve in neurocritical care monitoring. GFAP use as fluid biomarker, tied to astroglial proteinopathy, is relevant to post-traumatic neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

This study evaluates the impact of changing ocean conditions on larval recruitment of purple sea urchins in the Southern California Bight using 3D biophysical modeling, surface chlorophyll, and recruitment data. The influence of circulation, temperature, and food supply on larval recruitment is quantified using five modeled variables, larval dispersal distance, larval source location, larval food supply, and temperature exposure for larvae and adults, which are derived for 18 years and five larval recruitment sites. Sensitivity testing of the variables to different plankton larval durations (PLDs), larval behaviors, and nearshore retention is performed. All variables are found to be relatively insensitive to changes in PLD greater than 26 days. Larval dispersal distance and source location, representing changes in circulation, are found to be more sensitive to larval behavior and nearshore retention than larval food supply and temperature exposure for larvae and adults. All variables are statistically compared to recruitment field data. Temperature exposure for adults during the fall reproductive season is found to be a strong driver of larval recruitment while temperature exposure for larvae during the spring recruitment season is not. Food supply is not found to be a driver of larval recruitment. Circulation is found to be a driver of larval recruitment if larvae have behavior that reduces their dispersal distance, allowing them to come from source sites near to the recruitment sites. Overall, we hypothesize that larval behavior which reduces dispersal improves recruitment and that the timing of recruitment and reproduction can predict the impact of temperature on recruitment.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Establishment, maintenance, and interconversion of chromatin states is required for correct patterns of gene expression, genome integrity, and survival. Transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin minimizes mobilization of transposable elements and limits expansion of other repetitive DNA, but mechanisms for recognition of the latter sequences are not well established. We previously demonstrated in Drosophila melanogaster that transcripts derived from 1360 and Invader4 transposon insertions can trigger local conversion of transcriptionally permissive euchromatin to heterochromatin through the piRNA system, but only in a subset of genomic locations near existing blocks of heterochromatin. Here we show that a ~9 kb tandem array of the 36-nucleotide lac operator (lacO) sequence of Escherichia coli can form ectopic heterochromatin at a similar subset of sites, resulting in variegating expression of an adjacent reporter gene. Heterochromatin Protein 1a (HP1a) and histone deacetylation are required for lacO repeat-induced silencing, but, contrasting with previously described Position Effect Variegation (PEV), we do not observe increased histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. Silencing is effective at 25{degrees}C and suppressed at 18{degrees}C (in contrast to canonical PEV, which is enhanced at 18{degrees}C), indicating involvement of a temperature-sensitive component. Temperature switching experiments show that lacO repeat-induced heterochromatin formation is reversible throughout larval development following an HP1a-dependent initiation step in the early embryo. We conclude that the Drosophila nucleus can recognize a completely foreign tandem repeat as a target for heterochromatin formation, and that the heterochromatin structure established is distinct from that of endogenous tandem arrays.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

To address these challenges, we established a hybrid photosynthetic microbiome by replacing the native cyanobacterium of a natural microbial consortium with a genetically engineered Synechocystis strain optimized for PHB production. This new community retained the ecological structure and stability of the original microbiome while gaining synthetic production capacity. Compared to the axenic strain, the hybrid system exhibited enhanced robustness under abiotic stress, including light and temperature fluctuations, and improved tolerance to operational instability. These features made it suitable for upscaling and application in non-sterile environments. The hybrid microbiome sustained PHB production in scaled photobioreactors, reaching up to 32% PHB per cell dry weight (CDW) equal to ~230 mg L-1 under fully photoautotrophic conditions. Production was also achieved under dark conditions with acetate supplementation, highlighting the system metabolic flexibility.

One major QTL contributes more than 10% to the mean horn length difference between the two species. This QTL encompasses a conserved Wnt-family gene cluster, key upstream regulators that are well-known for their roles in morphological diversification in animals.

PEs form abundant chromosomal contacts with developmental genes, but when these contacts emerge, how their formation relates to enhancer poising and their functional significance remains incompletely understood. Here, we devise high-resolution, PE-targeted Capture Hi-C to generate a comprehensive atlas of PE chromosomal contacts in the time course of hPSC transition from the naive to primed state. We find that enhancer poising emerges early in the transition, while the contacts show diverse dynamics that is only partially coupled to poising. PROTAC-induced degradation of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) early in the transition weakens PE connectivity, while inhibition of its H3K27 methyltransferase activity does not, suggesting a non-catalytic role of Polycomb in supporting PE contacts.

First, we formalize an Episode Generation Protocol (EGP) that creates compositional episodes with controllable overlap and noise, and define a corresponding semantic structure as conditional probabilities between concepts. We then show analytically and through simulations that recurrent synapses converge to conditional firing probabilities, thereby encoding asymmetric semantic relationships across concepts. These recurrent dynamics enable reliable recall and replay of overlapping episodes without representational collapse. Finally, by incorporating feed-forward plasticity with a neuronal maturity mechanism, output neurons form selective receptive fields in a one-shot manner and refine them through replay, yielding robust unsupervised classification of overlapping episodes.

Although Twist1 null embryos display complete cranial neural tube closure defects and conditional knockout in neuroectoderm disrupts cranial neural crest cell fate determination and delamination, the function of TWIST1 in neural tube morphogenesis remains unknown. We investigated the basis underlying neuroectodermal morphological abnormalities in TWIST1 mutant embryos, specifically the formation of ectopic lateral bending points and cellular disorganization, by examining TWIST1 function in cilia formation, adherens junction integrity, and endocytic vesicle dynamics. Results: Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that cytosolic TWIST1 colocalizes with {beta}-catenin and endocytic regulators LRP2 and RAB11B along the apical surface of cranial neuroectoderm. Twist1 knockout resulted in reduced ciliary length and number. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses demonstrated upregulation of RAB11B and {beta}-catenin at mRNA and protein levels in Twist1 mutants. This molecular dysregulation coincided with increased accumulation of apical endocytic vesicles and altered expression profiles of endocytic component genes, ultimately modifying the apical neuroectodermal cell-cell junctions.

Here, we catalogue currently reported disease-associated mutations in RASA1 and assess their impact on RasGAP protein in vitro. On mapping these mutations onto experimental structures and structural models of RasGAP we identify regions that suggest functional impact. We assess key mutations within these regions for their effects on protein expression, thermal stability, and their interactions with a known binding partner, p190RasGAP. We then assess Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the mutant RasGAP proteins towards Ras. Together, we find that disease-associated RasGAP mutations classify into a panel of distinct classes based on their mode of dysregulation. We demonstrate that protein stability is necessary but not sufficient for full catalytic activity and that destabilizing mutations across the length of the protein can disrupt this function, but that the C2 domain appears to be unique in its role of regulating GAP activity by mechanisms other than destabilization involving the interactions of specific residues.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

While numerous studies have explored functions for the GlialCAM IgG-like domains in brain development and physiology, functions for its cytoplasmic signaling tail remain largely unknown. Therefore, we developed a mutant mouse model that expresses a truncated GlialCAM construct (GlialCAM -CT) that contains intact extracellular and transmembrane domains but lacks the cytoplasmic tail. Deletion of the GlialCAM cytoplasmic domain in glial cells of the brain results in vacuolization within white matter regions without disrupting neurovascular barrier integrity. Consequently, mutant mice exhibited selective deficits in motor coordination, muscular strength, and memory. Single cell transcriptome sequencing identifies GlialCAM-dependent defects in ECM remodeling pathways in white matter tracts. In situ spatial profiling revealed robust activation of astrocytes and microglia in the mutant brain. Proteomic analysis identified GlialCAM cytoplasmic tail interactors with links to MAPK signaling and cytoskeletal regulatory networks. These data reveal important functions for the GlialCAM cytoplasmic tail in homeostasis of white matter tracts in the adult murine brain. The GlialCAM -CT model may also be useful for studying the pathogenesis and possible treatment of neurological diseases linked to white matter degeneration.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Acoel worms, the sister lineage to all other animals with brains, offer a window into this transition. We studied the three-banded panther worm Hofstenia miamia, whose brain is diffuse and unlike any previously described: it shows little anatomical or functional regionalization or stereotypy. Worms forage successfully even after large portions of the brain are removed, suggesting most regions can perform most computations. Neural cell type markers are also distributed across the brain with little regionalization. High-resolution studies of hunting reveal that more brain tissue improves performance, but no specific brain region is required. These results lead us to propose that H. miamia's brain is built from computationally pluripotent 'tiles', whose interactions generate coherent behavior.

Two key domains are moral harm aversion, where individuals forgo personal gains to prevent harming others, and prosocial effort, which involves exerting effort to benefit others. Although previous studies suggest a relationship between these behaviours, it remains unclear whether neural responses in one domain can predict prosocial motivation in another. Here, we tested whether neural sensitivity to morally salient information in harm aversion could predict prosocial effort later. Participants completed two tasks: a harm aversion task during fMRI, in which they traded off monetary profit against delivering electric shocks to another person; and, one week later, a prosocial effort task outside the scanner, in which they decided whether rewards for others were worth the required physical effort. We focused on three regions implicated in cost-benefit decision-making and social cognition: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Behaviourally, greater harm aversion was associated with increased prosocial effort. Neurally, AI responses to others harm predicted sensitivity to others rewards in the effort task, consistent with a role in representing others outcomes across positive and negative valences. By contrast, TPJ responses to profit from harming others predicted decreased sensitivity to others rewards, suggesting a role in context-dependent valuation that may constrain prosocial behaviour. These findings demonstrate that neural responses to morally salient information in one context correlate with prosocial motivation in another, highlighting mechanisms that bridge moral sensitivity and effortful prosociality.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Free-living kinetoplastids are greatly understudied compared to their parasitic relatives, but are ecologically important microbivores, and collectively comprise the great majority of kinetoplastid diversity. For two decades kinetoplastids have been divided into prokinetoplastids and metakinetoplastids, with the latter further split into four orders, the most diverse of which is Neobodonida. However, the position of the root of the metakinetoplastids and whether neobodonids are a clade has remained unclear due to a lack of multi-gene data from free-living kinetoplastids, particularly neobodonids. Here, we present transcriptomic data for seven newly or recently cultivated free-living neobodonid kinetoplastids. Phylogenomic analyses of a de novo generated data set of 469 inferred orthologs and 45 taxa robustly resolve the kinetoplastid tree, including the position of the root of metakinetoplastids. This divides metakinetoplastids such that Trypanosomatida, Eubodonida, Parabodonida, Allobodonidae (formerly neobodonid clade \"1E\") and neobodonid clade \"1D\" fall on one side, while neobodonid clades \"1B\" (Rhynchomonadidae) and \"1C\" fall on the other. Neobodonids are thus inferred to be a paraphyletic group from which all other metakinetoplastids descend.

Little is known about whether tissues maintain distinct polyamine setpoints, how these setpoints are established, or whether such differences underlie selective vulnerability in disease. Here, we applied single-cell polyamine measurements in living Caenorhabditis elegans to map tissue polyamine levels and their regulatory dependencies. Three principles emerge: (i) Across differentiated tissues, steady-state polyamine pools are maintained primarily by transporter-mediated import rather than de novo synthesis. (ii) The intestine functions as a systemic regulator: perturbing intestinal polyamines affects organism-wide levels, and intestine-specific rescue restores systemic balance. (iii) Neurons maintain markedly low polyamine pools and undergo subtype-specific developmental reprogramming, switching polyamine acquisition strategies as they mature. These findings define core principles of tissue-specific polyamine regulation in vivo and provide a framework for developing therapeutic strategies to restore polyamine balance.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Bird species can be automatically identified using pre-trained models, such as BirdNET. The performance of these models can be significantly improved through fine-tuning with annotated samples recorded in the specific acoustic conditions in which the microphones are deployed. However, PAM collects vast amounts of data, and annotating bird vocalizations requires specialized expertise. As a result, only a very small portion of the recordings can be effectively labeled. Selecting the most relevant samples to annotate in order to maximize performance in model fine-tuning remains a significant challenge. First, a regularization technique addresses the challenge of class imbalance during model fine-tuning. Next, a data-driven methodology is developed, introducing the influence score, which quantifies the impact of individual training samples on model performance to inform sampling strategies. A linear model is proposed to estimate the influence score for generalization to unseen data. Finally, several sampling strategies are compared, based on acoustic indices and predictions of the pre-trained model. Together, these contributions enable the identification of efficient annotation strategies to overcome the challenges of limited annotation resources in large-scale passive acoustic monitoring.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

High expression of Cas9 has been shown to cause cytotoxicity in some cell types. Here, we show that Cas9 expression alone causes cytotoxicity in the dendritic arborization (da) neurons that are widely used to study neuronal development and regeneration. We then systematically evaluate alternative Cas9 transgenes designed to lower total Cas9 expression, called uCas9 transgenes. We show that expression of these uCas9 transgenes results in little to no cytotoxicity to da neurons. Lastly, we demonstrate the ability of uCas9 transgenes to effectively and specifically gene edit in da neurons.

Using mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that Drosophila melanogaster detoxifies nicotine through glycosylation, producing nicotine N-glycoside. Given that many new agrochemicals contain pyridine rings, we also investigated the metabolism of flonicamid and imidacloprid. We detected glycosylation of flonicamid, but not imidacloprid. A targeted RNAi screen across 21 UDP-glycosyltransferases (Ugts) identified Ugt35B1 as important for survival of nicotine exposure. CRISPR-based knockout of Ugt35B1 increases sensitivity to nicotine and flonicamid, but not to imidacloprid, nor to a structurally distinct neonicotinoid (thiamethoxam). Mass spectrometry of knockout and control flies confirms that Ugt35B1 glycosylates nicotine, its metabolite cotinine, and flonicamid.

Single-cell transcriptomics of the Drosophila melanogaster antenna identified selective expression of the G{gamma}30A subunit in acid-sensing Ir64a-DC4 neurons. G{gamma}30A is essential for broadening responses to long-chain acids, acting with Gs, G{beta}13F, adenylate cyclase Ac13E and the Cngl channel. We further discovered that Cirl, a latrophilin-family GPCR, is broadly-transcribed in the antenna but the protein is localized only in Ir64a-DC4 sensory cilia, dependent upon G{gamma}30A, but not Ir64a. Importantly, loss of Cirl also narrows Ir64a-DC4 tuning properties. Homologous neurons in Drosophila sechellia naturally exhibit narrow acid tuning, despite functional conservation of Ir64a; these differences correlate instead with lower expression of metabotropic components.

AlphaFold2- and AlphaFold-Multimer-based modelling, supported by multiple sequence alignment and functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, identified the most likely stoichiometries for two compositions of subunits previously described, named Lsa-nAChR1 and Lsa-nAChR2. For receptor Lsa-nAChR1, the highest scoring stoichiometry was 1{beta}122{beta}2. Lsa-nAChR2 exhibited three possible stoichiometries, confirmed by both computational modelling and experiments. These are 3{beta}23{beta}1{beta}2, 3{beta}13{beta}1{beta}2, and 333{beta}1{beta}2. All stoichiometries are written from a counterclockwise, extracellular orientation. Strikingly, structural modelling also suggested that linker flexibility in concatemer constructs may allow a novel conformation with a different subunit between the linked subunits, referred to here as 'wedging'. These results indicate that the use of flexible linker sequences does not reliably enforce subunit position or assembly directionality, as shown here for nAChRs. These findings challenge the assumption that linked concatemers unambiguously dictate receptor stoichiometry.

We evaluated msBayesImpute against several popular imputation methods using both simulated missing values and those generated through a dilution series experiment on samples from lung cancer patients. Our comprehensive benchmark demonstrated superior performance in reconstructing missing values, estimating normalization factors, and identifying differentially expressed proteins across varying levels of missingness.

We profiled 12-week-old mice in three hormonal contexts, i.e. male, female, and testosterone-treated female, combining tear biochemistry and label-free proteomics with epithelial lineage dynamics, in vivo sensory function, and corneal/trigeminal transcriptional readouts. Tear collection rate was comparable across groups, but total tear protein was reduced in females. Proteomics revealed extensive sex differences in extracellular composition, spanning lipid transport, protease, antiprotease balance, complement activity, and secretory/mucin pathways. Epithelial analyses showed sex-linked differences in progenitor output and spatial deployment, and sensory metrics indicated divergent innervation architecture and function. Across modalities, androgen supplementation in females shifted molecular and physiological profiles toward the male state, attenuating nearly all dimorphic signals, demonstrating that close to all sexual dimorphism observed here is reversible by testosterone and reflects an actively maintained endocrine state rather than a fixed developmental program. Complementary metabolite profiling provides a sex-stratified atlas of free modified nucleosides in tears, positioning extracellular epitranscriptomic markers as accessible indicators of hormonal context. Together, these results establish a multiscale, hormone-responsive sexual dimorphism at the ocular surface and offer a mechanistic framework linking sex and endocrine status to parameters that influence graft integration.

Furthermore, we observed that DYSF regulates Ca2+ influx into the cell and activates the STAT1 signaling pathway, whereas DYSF deficiency suppresses these processes. Macrophages overexpressing DYSF are associated with the inhibition of myoblast differentiation during myogenesis in a co-culture system involving macrophages and myoblasts.

Using a model dark taxon, the Phoridae (Diptera), the workflow performs three core tasks: sex identification, specimen orientation classification, and anatomical segmentation. Sex identification allows selective retention of diagnostically informative specimens, avoiding wasted effort on non-diagnostic individuals. Orientation classification enables specimens in the desired orientation to proceed immediately, while suboptimally oriented specimens can be repositioned for informative processing. Anatomical segmentation allows targeted processing of specimens displaying diagnostic characters or targeted analysis of specific anatomical regions in subsequent workflow steps. Comparative analysis of model architectures shows task-specific selection is crucial: a Convolutional Neural Network achieved an accuracy of 0.94 for orientation, a Vision Transformer achieved 0.88 for sex, and a U-Net precisely segmented nine anatomical regions with a mean IoU of 0.78. These results demonstrate that robotic imaging combined with deep learning provides a validated foundation for high-throughput, targeted specimen processing, maximising efficiency and utility for taxonomic and trait-based analyses, and supporting scalable, sustainable biodiversity workflows.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Dimerization of the Amyloid Precursor Protein transmembrane domain (C99) is a particular step of importance in the production of amyloid-{beta} protein and the amyloid cascade. Molecular dynamics simulations of the C99 dimer and other transmembrane proteins have been performed to compliment micelle-phase protein structure studies. It has often been assumed that the value of s*dim is the same as that of the pure, empty micelle. Here, we provide a convenient method for testing that assumption, while also accounting for the finite-size effects inherent in computer simulations of micelle self-assembly. Employing large, unbiased, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of DPC and C99 dimer self-assembly, we determined the radius of gyration to be 21.6 {+/-} 2.0 [A] for the micelle-encapsulated dimer, and 16.0 {+/-} 1.0 [A] for the pure DPC micelle. Using these radii of gyration, we performed all-atom simulations of DPC-encapsulated C99 dimers with preferred aggregation numbers of 100 and 54 DPC to test the effect of using an expected versus a naive estimate of aggregation number on the structure of the transmembrane protein dimer. Through atomistic simulations, we determined that the transmembrane dimeric structure displays different characteristics depending on the aggregation number of the micelle, in addition to increased water penetration and micelle defects when the aggregation number is too small.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Comparative gene set enrichment analysis reveals a concordant serrated pathway signature between colorectal cancer tissue of patients colonized with cnf1+ bacteria and CNF1-treated mouse intestinal organoids. RNA sequencing of organoids shows that CNF1 induces a fetal-like transcriptional reprogramming. Using integrated approaches, we demonstrate that CNF1 reprograms Lgr5+ stem cells into a Ly6a/Sca-1+ fetal-like state, that exhibits enhanced stemness potential.

To date, single cell studies of microglia have focused on RNA-sequencing or cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) which provide indirect readouts of protein abundance or quantification of a limited number of targets. Herein, we present a workflow based on FACS-assisted isolation, cryopreservation and nanodroplet-based processing for single-cell mass spectrometry proteomics analysis of the postmortem human brain cortex-derived microglia. From a single microglial cell, 1039 proteins could be identified on average. As a proof-of-principle we applied single-cell proteomics for exploring the heterogeneity of brain microglia at the cellular level. This pilot proteomics data partially recapitulates the prior microglia subtypes. Specifically, we determined mitochondrial proteins, in particular members of NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), cytochrome b-c1 (Complex III), cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), F1-ATPase (Complex V), and Na+/K+-ATPase complex drive variation across microglia.

In contrast, spiny mice exhibit complex tissue regeneration as adults and provide a blueprint for how regeneration can occur throughout adulthood in mammals. Fibroblasts are key mediators of wound healing outcomes and prior work uncovered that cells from highly regenerative mammals (spiny mice and rabbits) exhibit extreme resistance to oxidative stress compared to those from non-regenerating laboratory mice and rats. Using a battery of cellular tests in primary ear pinna fibroblasts from highly regenerative and non-regenerative mammals, we find that cells from spiny mice and rabbits exhibit a baseline preference for glycolysis supporting a lower ROS-producing basal state. Uniquely, spiny mouse fibroblasts exhibit large, spherical, depolarized mitochondria similar to megamitochondria identified in pathological tissues. The megamitochondria phenotype was present across lifespan in ear pinna fibroblasts from fetal, young and old spiny mice. While rabbit, mouse and rat fibroblasts had polarized tubular mitochondrial networks typical of adult mammalian fibroblasts, isolated rabbit and spiny mice fibroblasts shared lower oxygen consumption efficiency even in the absence of a potential gradient. Taken together, our results support that a shared metabolic signature exists in stromal cells from highly regenerative mammals, although possibly driven by different mechanisms, to converge on a ROS-resistant phenotype which ultimately helps supports tissue regeneration.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

We evaluate an iterative Bayesian forecast model of black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) phenology and population dynamics at near-term to interannual (e.g. 12 month) scales. The black-legged tick is the vector of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of human Lyme disease. Our forecasts consistently outperformed seasonal null models based on historical day-of-year averages, particularly during peak questing periods when disease risk is highest. Iterative data assimilation improved forecast performance over time, demonstrating the ability to adaptively learn about climate-driven shifts in demographic parameters, and reinforcing the value of long-term data to support management. Weather and climate variables emerged as the dominant predictors of nymph survival, with daily maximum temperature displacing humidity as the strongest predictor as the iterative forecast cycle evolved over time. Short-term forecasts driven by local weather observations were more accurate than those relying on seasonal climate forecasts, highlighting the importance of fine-scale weather dynamics and data for subannual predictions. At interannual scales, seasonal climate forecasts and vertebrate host (mouse) abundance were important for maintaining strong predictive skill in forecasting nymphal tick abundance, which is often used as a proxy for risk of human exposure to tick-borne disease, but forecasts were largely unaffected by larval abundance. Investment in monitoring efforts should prioritize observations of the nymphal stage to reduce forecast uncertainty. These results offer a path forward for operationalizing ecological forecasts of tick populations under environmental change and underscore the importance of adaptive, process-based models for managing tick-borne disease risk in a changing climate.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

G.; Capilla-Lasheras, P.; Prokic, M.", "abstract": "Despite the growing interest of evolutionary biologists and ecologists in unravelling the mechanisms behind animal responses to challenging conditions, our knowledge remains limited. To contribute to this field, we conducted a global meta-analysis (N= 112 unique studies, k = 2,840 independent estimates) to synthesize empirical information on the influence of vertebrate dormancy (i.e., cold- and heat-induced dormancy) on redox status, immune function, and glucocorticoid levels. Our study reveals that dormancy has contrasting effects on animal physiology, depending on the thermoregulatory strategy. In endotherms, both dormant and arousal states are accompanied by reduced ROS production, lower oxidative damage, or upregulated antioxidant response, whereas in ectotherms, greater oxidative damage occurs only during the dormant state. Likewise, innate immune responses are upregulated during arousal in endotherms, while ectotherms downregulate pathways involved both in innate and adaptive responses during the dormant state. Interestingly, glucocorticoid levels remain stable throughout dormancy, suggesting that undergoing metabolic shifts may uncouple glucocorticoid release. These findings provide mechanistic explanation on the eco-evolutionary consequences of dormancy, revealing diverging strategies between endotherms and ectotherms. By highlighting metabolic depression as a central axis of these responses, our results also inform conservation strategies for dormant species facing rapid environmental change.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

We show that monkeys responded to dogs with a two-pronged behaviour: they emitted alarm calls, and became more vigilant and displayed aggressive behaviours towards the dogs. While their movement highlighted risk-prone behaviour, they appeared to have mapped and planned for risk, as they reacted more strongly when risk was unexpected. The response intensity was further modulated by risk labels typically encountered in their natural environment, but not by labels uniquely associated with dogs. This highlights that vervet monkeys responded with ingrained behaviour to this evolutionarily new threat, anticipating risk based on long-term spatial memory, but failed to integrate evolutionarily new information.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems have emerged as essential platforms for in-vitro cell-based applications, offering microenvironments that are more physiologically relevant compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures. However, independently controlling the topological and mechanical features of 3D matrices remains challenging due to the interdependence of these parameters. In this study, we demonstrate a method for independently tuning pore size and stiffness in collagen I (Coll I) networks and examine their effects on breast cancer and epithelial cell morphology and cluster formation. Collagen concentration was used to modulate bulk stiffness, while polymerization temperature was adjusted to control pore size. Using this approach, we developed a 3D Coll I matrix with tuned stiffnesses from 80, 228 and 360 Pa while simultaneously holding pore size constant (2.5 um). Similarly, we developed a low- (1.5 mg/mL) and high- (3.5 mg/mL) concentration collagen hydrogel with varying pore sizes from 2.5 um to 3.1 um and 2.0 um to 2.4 um, respectively, without altering stiffness (80 Pa and 350 Pa). Integrating a breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, and metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, we demonstrate matrix stiffness and pore size independently and differentially regulate cell morphology and cluster formation.

Segregation of DNA lesions in the early genealogy of an expanding clone leaves a statistically interpretable footprint of cancer initiating events. Specifically, it allows for estimating the number of cell divisions between the initiating DNA lesion and the most recent common ancestor of the tumor. Here, we analyze footprints of segregating lesions from a previously published experimental mouse system, as well as post-chemotherapy human metastatic tumors and the blood of chemotherapy treated patients. In all contexts, clones tend to start early, usually within the span of 4 cell generations from mutagen exposure. Using a branching process model, we show that fitness advantage of early cancer drivers exceeds 30%, with each early division leading to at least 1.3 self-renewing cells. We highlight an example of a blood-derived single cell phylogeny with major subclones separated by just two cell divisions.

Therapeutic strategies targeting IL-17, such as blocking antibodies like secukinumab (Cosentyx), have been successfully developed. These antibodies are currently employed in the treatment of various conditions, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. More recently, a small molecule inhibitor of IL-17, LY3509754, progressed to clinical trials but was halted during Phase 1 due to unfavorable hepatotoxicity. Two derivatives, compounds 7 and 8, did not advance to clinical trials due to safety concerns. These three compounds (7, 8, and the original lead compound, presumably implied) share a common difluoro substituent, which was hypothesized to be the cause of the observed safety issues. In subsequent structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, replacing the difluoro substituent with a single methyl group (resulting in compound 9) unexpectedly led to a significant improvement in cellular activity.

The G protein-coupled receptor GPR31 has been identified as a putative receptor for 12-HETE. In this study, we generated conventional GPR31 knockout (KO) mice on the C57BL/6J background. To interrogate the role of GPR31 in {beta} cells, we treated islets from wildtype and Gpr31b-/- mice with pro-inflammatory cytokines and subjected the islets to RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed pathways in Gpr31b-/- islets included those pertaining to inflammation and oxidative stress, consistent with functional studies that demonstrated reduced cytokine-induced oxidative stress in Gpr31b-/- islets compared to wildtype controls. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from Gpr31b-/- mice showed reduced macrophage migration and decreased inflammatory IFN- and IFN-{gamma} signaling by RNA sequencing.

Detailed studies on the timecourse of microvascular occlusions indicate that endogenous mechanisms exist to re-canalize occluded vessels. One recently discovered mechanism is angiophagy, where vessels engulf and expel microemboli, thus mitigating damage caused by micro-occlusions. While several previous studies have shown that angiophagy occurs in rodent models, the frequency and timing of this process is not well characterized. In addition, there is limited data on the impact of aging on angiophagy, or the occurrence of this process in clinically relevant diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Methods: To further study the timecourse of angiophagy, we induced micro-occlusions in young, aged and 3xTg Alzheimer's mice via injection of 20um microspheres into the carotid artery. Mice were sacrificed on day 3, 7 or 14 and the brains were processed for brain-wide localization of microspheres and quantification of angiophagy. Results: We found the largest number of microspheres in the neocortex, yet when accounting for region size, microspheres were more evenly distributed across brain regions. When quantifying angiophagy in young non-diseased mice, we found that approximately 43% of microspheres had extravasated from the vessel by day 14. This process was delayed in aged mice, with only 10% of microspheres extravasated by day 14. Moreover, in young 3xTg Alzheimer's mice, we found the rate of angiophagy to be more efficient at day 14 compared to non-transgenic controls, with 47% and 43% of microspheres extravasated, respectively. A similar trend was observed in aged Alzheimer?s mice, in which 38% of microspheres were extravasated by day 14 in 3xTg mice, compared to only 30% in non-transgenic controls. Conclusions: Taken together, we find that while aging impairs the process of angiophagy, Alzheimer's mice exhibit a paradoxical increase in the rate of microsphere extravasation.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

While bco1 is found across vertebrate taxa, bco1l is a paralog of bco1 that we discover to have evolved in the ray-finned fishes, the most abundant, speciose, and commercially important group of fishes. We investigated the function of bco1l in ray-finned Siamese fighting fish, commonly known as betta, an emerging model for genetics and development. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, we find that lack of bco1l results in reduced VA and elevated {beta}-carotene in larvae, starting when animals have exhausted their yolk supply of retinal, followed by stunted growth and death during juvenile development. Exogenous retinoic acid rescues the mutation, demonstrating its deficiency causes these defects. bco1l is 4x more abundant than bco1 in the intestine.

Tumor cell dissemination requires invasion at local and distant sites. This process can be influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Here, we investigate the role of neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) invasion and metastasis. TNBC cells increased invasion in response to GABA through the GABAA receptor family -specifically GABRE- and increased GSK3 activity. TNBC cell lines were found to be responsive to exogenous GABA and also produced endogenous GABA. Blocking the actions of GABA reduced invasion and tumor cell dissemination. These findings support a role for GABA signaling through GABAA receptors in mediating the dissemination of TNBC cells.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that protein variants derived from distinct IFNLR1 splice isoforms uniquely influence gene expression and HBV replication in stem cell-derived hepatocytes (iHeps). Here, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction by full-length canonical IFNLR1 (variant 1) and a non-canonical variant missing a portion of the Box1 and Box2 JAK1-interacting motifs (variant 2). Methods: We used HEK293T cells, wild-type (WT), and IFNLR1 knock-out (KO) iHeps that stably express doxycycline-inducible, FLAG-tagged IFNLR1 variants to evaluate function. Cellular responses to IFNL were measured using the Duolink proximity ligand assay, ImageStream flow cytometry, western blotting of JAK-STAT proteins, susceptibility to JAK1 and TYK2-specific inhibitors, and gene expression profiling. Results: While each IFNLR1 variant colocalized with IL10RB after IFNL treatment, variant 1 was more rapidly and extensively internalized than variant 2. In WT iHeps with intact endogenous IFNLR1, expression of variant 2 enabled higher JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation than variant 1, yet contrarily, variant 1 enabled greater STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation that resulted in broader and higher expression of ISGs. Select ISGs exhibited differential constitutive expression in IFNL-untreated variant-expressing iHeps but were IFNL-inducible through both variants. In iHeps expressing variant 1, WT-iHeps were more resistant than KO-iHeps to TYK2-inhibition of antiviral ISG expression yet conversely were more susceptible to TYK2 inhibition of proinflammatory ISG expression, suggesting noncanonical variants made from endogenous IFNLR1 transcripts influence the TYK2-dependence of IFNL signaling. Conclusions: IFNLR1 variants promote differential utilization of signaling mediators to influence IFNL-induced gene expression patterns, indicating a putative role in pathway regulation.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

G.; Tiris, F.; Erdmann, R.; Kalel, V. C.", "abstract": "Trypanosomatid parasites that cause life threatening tropical diseases harbor specialized essential organelles, called glycosomes. Like other peroxisome-related organelles, the biogenesis of glycosomes is mediated by proteins known as peroxins (PEX). A cascade of PEX protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential for glycosome function and parasite survival. Accordingly, small molecule inhibitors of PEX proteins that disrupt glycosomal matrix or membrane protein import have been reported as potential therapies for trypanosomiasis. We recently identified the long sought-after Trypanosoma PEX15 (TbPEX15), which anchors the PEX1-PEX6 complex to the glycosomal membrane for recycling of the receptor PEX5. Defects in this process cause PEX5 degradation, mislocalization of glycosomal matrix proteins and parasite death. In this study, we targeted the interaction between TbPEX6 and TbPEX15. Recombinant TbPEX6 and TbPEX15 were purified, and their interaction was confirmed by in vitro pull-down assays and size exclusion chromatography. Furthermore, we established an AlphaScreen-based method to identify small molecule inhibitors of this PPI. Screening of a drug-repurposing library identified two inhibitors with trypanocidal activity against T. brucei in vitro and the amastigote stage of T. cruzi. Given its essentiality and low sequence similarity to its human homolog, parasite PEX15 and its interaction with PEX6 represent promising targets for the development of new therapies against trypanosomatid infections.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

The workflows support cell density monitoring, arrayed passaging, sample cherry-picking, plate reformatting, cell density normalization, and cryopreservation in 96-well plates.

Workflow consistency was demonstrated across multiple cell lines and biological replicates, with wells showing comparable confluency within three standard deviations, lower coefficient of variation, and substantially narrower interquartile ranges after a single cell passage and density normalization. Four automation pipelines, including monoclonality screening, cell passaging and cherry-picking, density normalization, and cryopreservation, collectively enable clonal line establishment.

In these ecosystems, vegetation often grows in spatially periodic patterns that differ as aridity increases (gaps, labyrinths and clumps), which has been widely studied theoretically, aiming to assess the proximity of the system to desertification. While some theoretical models predict smooth desertification transitions, most typically predict an abrupt transition linked to the possibility of two alternative stable states (desert and vegetated states), predictions that are yet to be confirmed empirically. If this bistability of alternative stable states occurs, however, environmental fluctuations and the history of the ecosystem determine which state ultimately materializes. This uncertainty makes it harder to predict desertification, compounding the challenges posed by it. Here, we combine empirical data and theoretical methods to investigate the links between bistability and vegetation spatial organization, which can help identify the presence of alternative stable states. We found that, although the presence of vegetation clumps is not indicative of bistability, changes in clump morphology can provide reliable indicators of bistability and an impending desertification transition. Thus, our methodology indirectly identifies whether desertification will occur abruptly, and whether restoration efforts should consider a potential ecosystem history-dependence.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

We collected eDNA samples from locations in southern Taiwan during planting and harvesting, employing eDNA metabarcoding (COI) to detected diverse taxonomic groups. We assigned 78 ASVs across all sites to animal taxa, 34 of which were identified to species. Overall, 18 species were designated as native or non-native (83.3% and 16.6%, respectively), including three major rice pests, Chilo suppressalis (native), Coptotermes formosanus (native), and Pomacea canaliculata (non-native). Cultivation affected overall diversity, with higher species richness during planting compared to harvesting. No significant differences were observed between native and non-native taxa between cultivation phases.

The influence of temperature on recalcitrant seed germination has rarely been studied due to their desiccation sensitivity, which hampers storage. However, Mediterranean recalcitrant oaks would be particularly affected by the expected increased temperature in this region. Here we investigated the effect of warming temperatures on germination of 975 acorns from 8 range-wide Quercus suber populations. We sowed the acorns at 15, 20 and 25 {degrees}C in climatic chambers, and monitored germination during 4 months. The germination dynamics in each chamber was explored by a Cox proportional hazards model. We assessed environment (germination experiment temperatures), population (climate of seed origin) and their interaction effects on germination percentage, time, and synchrony using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Genetic clines on germination percentage, time and synchrony were mostly triggered by temperature, with seeds from warmer origins showing higher germination, earlier timing, and greater synchrony than colder ones. Higher sowing temperatures promoted advanced germination, and this effect was higher in seeds originating from regions with stronger seasonality. Earlier and synchronous germination found in seeds from warm origin may reduce the desiccation probability for acorns and seedlings, while late germination and low synchrony found in seeds from cold origin might be an adaptive response to unpredictable frost events that would impair seedling survival. The germination synchrony adaptive response was unexpected and further investigation on recalcitrant seeds' germination dynamics in response to increased temperatures is needed to confirm it.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Integrating entomopathogenic fungi into Integrated Pest Management (IPM) offers a sustainable alternative to sole reliance on insecticides. This study quantified the pathogenicity of Purpureocillium lilacinum and Clonostachys rosea against S. frugiperda under controlled conditions. Methods: Second-fifth instar larvae and eggs were exposed to 1x107, 1x108, and 1x109 conidia mL-1 of each fungus; sterile water served as control. Mortality was recorded over 3-9 days after treatment (DAT); feeding reduction was measured gravimetrically. Larval mortality was analyzed with GLMs/GLMMs (binomial-probit); feeding reduction by ANOVA/Tukey; LD50 and LT50 were estimated from dose-response models. Results: Mortality increased with dose and time, and decreased with larval stage. Peak larval mortality reached ~44% for P.lilacinum and ~49% for C. rosea at 1x109 conidia mL-1 by 9 DAT. Egg mortality was concentration?dependent (up to 82% and 88% for P. lilacinum and C. rosea, respectively, at 1x109 conidia mL-1). Feeding reduction reached 60-74% in early instars at the highest dose. Early instars were consistently more susceptible than late instars. Model outputs indicated significant effects of concentration and time; interaction concentrationxtime was significant, whereas fungal speciesxconcentration was not. Our findings supported the initial hypothesis. Mortality and feeding reduction increased with higher fungal concentrations and longer exposure times, and younger instars were consistently more susceptible than older instars. While both P. lilacinum and C. rosea were pathogenic, differences between species were minor compared to the effects of dose and instar stage. These outcomes validated the formulated hypotheses, and reinforce the potential of these native fungi as candidates for IPM. Conclusions: Native P. lilacinum and C. rosea display dose-, stage-, and time-dependent pathogenicity and feeding suppression against S. frugiperda.

In absence of endogen heat control, poikilothermic animals adjust their body temperature behaviorally. While many studies reported behavioral fever, its opposite, behavioral anapyrexia - when infected animals lower their body temperature by using cool microenvironments - remains poorly documented. Here, we report the first evidence of behavioral anapyrexia in a poikilothermic vertebrate as a response to pathogenic infection. We investigated thermoregulatory responses in tadpoles of the agile frog Rana dalmatina, a cool-adapted amphibian, following experimental infection with a warm-adapted ranavirus. Tadpoles were placed either in thermal gradients or homogeneously cool environments for five days post-exposure. In thermal gradients, all tadpoles reduced their preferred temperatures over time, but this decrease was steeper in infected tadpoles, and individuals with higher infection intensities preferred cooler temperatures. Infected tadpoles became increasingly precise in thermoregulation over time, while a similar trend was not detectable in non-infected tadpoles. Infection prevalence was similar between the two thermal environments, yet infection intensities were significantly higher in the thermal gradient. These results suggest fine-tuned thermoregulation by infected tadpoles to balance out the benefits of behavioral anapyrexia for fighting a warm-adapted pathogen versus the immune-suppressive and developmental costs of low temperatures.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Agricultural weeds offer ideal models for studying these adaptive dynamics as they rapidly evolve under both the intensive management practices designed to eliminate them and increasingly severe climate challenges such as drought. Here, we combine experimental and herbarium genomic approaches spanning within-generation to century-long timescales to understand how genome-wide variation responds to drought in Amaranthus tuberculatus. A history of divergent selection between two ancestral lineages is thought to play a role in this native species' invasion into agriculture. A drought survival experiment on accessions from paired agricultural and natural populations across its native range revealed substantial phenotypic variation differentiated by habitat, geography, and ancestry. Ancestry mapping revealed 43 independent regions across nearly all chromosomes that confer protective effects under drought, demonstrate particularly rapid allele frequency changes, and exhibit duration-specific selection over the course of the imposed drought. Observation of allele frequencies across the past century reveal evidence for climate-dependent fluctuating selection governing the evolution of drought-associated loci. Selection favors drought alleles during hot/dry years and selects against them in cool/wet years -- a pattern more evident in long-term trends than in shorter temporal intervals, suggestive of adaptive lag in rapidly changing environments. By combining short and long-term spatiotemporal data, we demonstrate that fluctuating selection has preserved the polygenic variation underlying drought tolerance, enabling ongoing adaptive responses to contemporary land-use and climate change.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

The selective costs imposed by drivers on their hosts may trigger intragenomic conflict, promoting the evolution of suppressors and fueling an ongoing arms race between drivers and suppressors. Stellate (Ste) is an X-linked tandemly arrayed multicopy gene. Its copy number ranges from 3 to more than 300 among Drosophila melanogaster strains from the Global Diversity Lines. In wild-type animals, Ste expression is usually suppressed by homologous piRNAs produced from the Suppressor of Stellate (Su(Ste)) array on the Y chromosome. Derepression of Ste in the absence Su(Ste) results in the formation of proteinaceous crystals in spermatocytes, chromatin compaction defects, reductions in fertility, and female-biased sex ratios arising from under-recovery of Y-bearing sperm. Despite extensive study, the function of the Stellate array and evolutionary significance of its persistence in the genome have remained elusive. It has been suggested to be a now-inactive relic of an ancient meiotic drive system, as perturbations in lab stocks can produce Ste-mediated meiotic distortions. Meiotic drive occurring among natural variants, however, has not been reported. We established crosses between females with high Ste copy number X chromosomes and males carrying low Su(Ste) copy number Y chromosomes and found that the male progeny displayed non-Mendelian sex chromosome transmission. Importantly, deletion of the euSte array in an otherwise matched genetic background rescues this phenotype, demonstrating that Stellate is an active driver in contemporary populations.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

The latter is negatively regulated by the Greatwall kinase (Gwl). In Xenopus oocytes, we show that the loss of Gwl and the subsequent hyperactivation of PP2A-B55 severely disrupt the transition from meiosis I to meiosis II. This disruption prevents phosphorylation of both Wee1/Myt1 and the APC/C complex, thereby blocking APC/C activation. As a consequence, APC/C remains inactive during the MI-MII transition, which impairs cyclin degradation and the partial CDK1 inactivation that is normally required at this stage. Additionally, the mos-MAPK-Rsk1/2 pathway fails to activate due to insufficient Mos accumulation, thereby preventing metaphase II arrest. Finally, the lack of APC/C activation during meiosis I inhibits the degradation of its inhibitor Erp1, revealing a critical feedback loop between APC/C and Erp1. Overall, our findings reveal that Gwl is a key coordinator of both meiotic divisions, acting through dual regulation of APC/C and the Mos/MAPK/Rsk1/2 pathways by modulating PP2A-B55 activity.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "Tumour development and progression are associated with biophysical alterations that manifest across multiple spatial scales, from the subcellular to multicellular tissue scale. While cells can dynamically regulate their biophysical properties such as volumes and mechanics in dependence of cell state and function, it is not well understood how cells are controlled in the dense multicellular environment of a developing tumour. Here, we quantitatively monitored cell and nuclear volumes of single cancer cells, while they grew into multicellular tumour spheroids within well-defined, tunable biohybrid polymer hydrogels. We quantitatively showed that the formation of multicellular structures is associated with marked reductions of cellular and nuclear volumes, cell cycle delays as well as cell mechanical alterations, and that these changes are coupled. Single-to-multicellular transitions coincided with a drastic decrease in median nuclear volumes by up to 60%, as well as overall cell volume decrease. The nuclear volume decrease could not be explained by growth-induced compressive stress due to confining microenvironments. Instead, cell cycle adaptions were identified as one significant contributor, with smaller-sized G1 cells accumulating in growing clusters, an effect which could be reversed by pharmacological inhibition of CDK1. In addition to cell cycle shifts, cells within spheroids had a higher mass density and were stiffer, which could be reverted upon cell release from clusters. In turn, multicellular-to-single cell transitions that happened in cells that invaded from a tumour spheroid into the surrounding matrix, were accompanied by nuclear volume increases and cell softening. Taken together, our study provides insights into how cells dynamically adapt their cellular/nuclear volumes, cell cycle progression and mechanics in dependence of the multicellular state.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Using 4-week-old (adolescent) and 16-week-old (adult) homozygous knock-in Dsg2-mutant (Dsg2mut/mut) mice, we found that loss of DSG2 leads to early onset chamber- and age-dependent cardiac dysfunction driven by Z-disc structural defects and increased myosin detachment rate. Interestingly, Ca2+;-activated force was markedly reduced in adolescent Dsg2mut/mut permeabilized left ventricular cardiac muscle bundles but preserved in permeabilized isolated cardiomyocytes. This disparity demonstrates that DSG2 is not only crucial for mechanical coupling between cardiomyocytes but also for force transmission within and between sarcomeres, revealing a novel role for DSG2 in maintaining contractile integrity at both the cellular and tissue levels.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms an elaborate contiguous network extending through the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The ER is surrounded by a membrane that separates its lumen from the cytoplasm. The ER membrane harbors channels and pumps capable of controlling ion flux and creating a voltage gradient. Because the ER membrane potential is difficult to study experimentally little is known about how voltage influences its many vital functions. Here we introduce optical probes of ER membrane potential derived from the hybrid voltage sensor (hVoS) family of genetically-encoded voltage sensors. Probes were targeted to the ER using motifs from three ER proteins, Sec61beta, cytochrome P450, and cytochrome b5 type A. As shown recently with other types of ER voltage sensors, patch-clamp fluorometry recording with our new probes demonstrated that voltage steps applied to the plasma membrane elicit a voltage change at the ER membrane. These probes exhibited subtle differences in their responses suggesting they target different ER compartments. The steeper voltage dependence of Sec61beta-hVoS (mCerulean3-Sec61beta) signals suggested that this probe targets an ER compartment rich in voltage-gated ion channels. The ER voltage change is slow, but its onset is virtually synchronous with the plasma membrane voltage step. This suggests a direct electrical coupling into the ER lumen through plasma membrane-ER contacts. Analysis with the aid of an equivalent circuit provided an estimate of the resistance of these contacts. The rapid, direct transmission of voltage changes from the plasma membrane to the ER provides a mechanism for regulating ER function that could be especially important in excitable cells. The sensors introduced here provide researchers with powerful tools for imaging ER voltage and assessing its impact on cellular function.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Artifacts were found to be negligible for neighbouring dipolar-coupled protons, >3 ang. apart, and a concept for identification for protons less than 3 ang. is provided. This approach revealed a previously hidden, second excited state (ES2) in DNA base-pairing that extends the well-established Watson-Crick-Franklin (WCF) ground state (GS) - Hoogsteen (HG) equilibrium. A structural model for ES2 is proposed based on evidence from 1H R1{rho} RD, trapping via DNA modifications, metadynamics simulations, and DFT-based chemical shift calculations. ES2 was stabilised by the anticancer drug Actinomycin D, providing direct experimental evidence that small molecule can remodel conformational landscape of DNA.

Transcripts of genes located near hypoxia-induced ER binding sites are significantly associated with reduced recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients. Transcriptomic profiling under hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen), with and without ER depletion by fulvestrant, revealed a hypoxia-induced, ER-dependent gene expression programme, including upregulation of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) regulatory subunits that results in acquired sensitivity to the ENaC inhibitor amiloride.

This study aimed to elucidate the transcriptional regulation heterogeneity of TAMs and uncover their interactions with ICC cells in driving tumour malignancy beyond immune suppression. Methods: Using a time-resolved AKT1/NICD1 ICC model and patient datasets, we mapped the spatiotemporal macrophage landscape and their role in tumour progression. By integrating cell-cell communication analysis with phosphoproteomics, we validated key signalling cascades using TAM-ICC co-culture, multiplex immunofluorescence, gene silencing, and conditional knockout mouse models. Single-cell ATAC-seq further revealed epigenomic profiles of TAM subsets and identified their regulatory networks. Results: Immune response M{varphi}_CXCL9 and inflammatory M{varphi}_S100A were enriched in early ICC lesions, while in advanced tumours an M2-like subset, M{varphi}_VEGFA, with high VEGFA, ARG1, GPNMB, SPP1, and C1QA, emerged as the major population and correlated with poor prognosis. Spatial transcriptomics revealed abundant M{varphi}_VEGFA infiltration at tumour boundaries with secretory and proliferative signatures. Further, M{varphi}_VEGFA drove tumour cell proliferation via the OSM-OSMR-STAT3-CCND1 axis and promoted invasion through THBS1-CD47-mTOR-DNB1 signalling. Lastly, MAFB directed M2 polarisation and upregulated OSM/THBS1 in M{varphi}_VEGFA.

Previous studies have suggested genes and associated molecular mechanisms involved in the production of diverse secondary metabolites. However, much less is known about the genetic bases underlying within-species diversity in metabolite accumulation patterns, particularly in less focused tissues such as rice hulls. In this study, we aimed to identify the causal variant that affects flavonoid accumulation in rice hulls. We identified an F-box containing protein IBF1 is causal for genotypic differences in hull color through positional cloning. The variety IR64, with straw-white hulls, harbors functional IBF1 proteins that interact with a chalcone synthase, CHS1. Conversely, frame-shift mutations of IBF1 in the variety DJ123, which has pigmented hull color, resulted in a lack of a Kelch domain essential for the IBF1-CHS1 interaction. As a result, the DJ123 variant of IBF1 (IBF1DJ123) no longer interacted with CHS1, which was further supported by deep learning-based protein structural modeling. Further metabolome and transcriptome analyses using IR64 and an IR64-based chromosomal segment substitution line (CSSL) carrying IBF1DJ123 revealed an increase in the content of multiple flavonoids (such as naringenin and luteolin), while suppressing the expression of CAD involved in lignin synthesis. Metabolites in the CSSL carrying IBF1DJ123 suppressed the growth and siderophore generation activity of Pantoea species, which can act as beneficial or pathogenic endophytes.

Leopards (Panthera pardus), a widely distributed generalist species, provide an ideal case for studying the role of the environment. The population dynamics of African and Asian leopards differ dramatically, with near panmixia in Africa versus a strong structure and eight subspecies in Asia. Fossil records show that a population in Europe disappeared after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), further pointing to complex range dynamics in Eurasia. In this study, we explicitly test the role of climate in shaping leopards population dynamics across the continents, by quantitatively combining paleoclimatic, demographic, and genetic simulations over the last 450 thousand years. Using an Approximate Bayesian Computational framework, we show that the genetic structure differences between Africa and Asia can be explained by distinct historical climatic conditions in these two continents: most of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia exhibited a stable range without geographical barriers, while other areas such as Morocco, Afghanistan and Northeast Asia showed expansion and extinction cycles during glacial and interglacials. We further model population dynamics in Europe and validate it against fossil and radiocarbon dates records. We find that European populations were likely fragile, with extinctions repeatedly predicted over multiple glacial cycles, indicating that climate change possibly led to the extinction of the European subspecies following the LGM. Notably, we found that climate during the Holocene should have allowed a more recent recolonisation that did not happen, indicating other factors such as human presence might have blocked it.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Dynamic weight bearing analysis confirmed persistent pain in SNI rats, validating the chronic pain phenotype in our experimental cohort. Longitudinal MRI revealed significant GMD alterations in 31 regions, predominantly within limbic, prefrontal, and cingulate circuits, representing 21% of total brain volume. Among this affected volume, over 17% of brain volume demonstrated GMD increases while only ~3% showed GMD decreases, indicating a heterogeneous neuroplastic response. Specifically, the Frontal Association Cortex exhibited an approximate 10% increase in GMD, the Primary Cingular Cortex showed a modest increase of about 2%, and the Amygdalohyppocampic Area demonstrated a ~10% decrease in GMD over 28 days. Primary sensory, parietal, visual, retrosplenial, and temporal cortices remained largely unaffected. No significant changes were observed in healthy animals over the same period, highlighting the specificity of brain reorganization to persistent neuropathic pain. These findings reaffirm the ability of MRI to robustly quantify pain-induced neuroanatomical remodeling but leave open critical questions about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.

Here, we sub-cultured dLasB PAO1 (a P.a strain that we have shown previously shown to have reduced virulence) in artificial sputum medium (ASM), a culture medium mimicking CF sputum in which bacteria often show auxotrophy.

We show that the Cnn PReM adopts a helical hairpin fold that autoinhibits CM2 binding but that phosphorylation appears to increase hairpin breathing to permit CM2 engagement and robust scaffold assembly. Phospho-blocking mutations prevent PReM--CM2 interactions and scaffold formation, whereas phospho-mimetic substitutions partially restore function.

The goal of this study was to comprehensively ascertain differences in trafficking and post-translational processing between wild-type and disease-associated SP-C mutants using doxycycline-inducible mouse lung epithelial (MLE-12) cell lines expressing either wildtype SP-C or the common clinical variant SP-CI73T, validated using primary AT2 cells isolated from a murine SP-CI73T pulmonary fibrosis model and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2s) expressing the same mutant. In all 3 models SP-CWT was highly concentrated in acidic LROs while SP-CI73T accumulated on the plasma membrane, which was corroborated by inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, surface biotinylation, immunogold EM, immunofluorescent staining in non-permeabilized cells, and proteinase K protection assays supporting divergence of SP-CI73T trafficking from SP-CWT. The exclusion of SP-CI73T from normal routing occurred early in the biosynthetic pathway as Brefeldin A blocked processing of both SP-C proproteins, while a 20{ring}C temperature shift caused selective accumulation of a processed proSP-CWT intermediate, suggesting initial C-terminal cleavage of proSP-CWT occurs in late-Golgi/ trans-Golgi network (TGN).

CCL19 is known to activate actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells, generating a mode of motility driven by lamellipodial protrusions. In contrast, we showed recently that S1P induces a transient lamellipodial response, followed by pressure-driven bleb-based motility. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms controlling S1P responses in naive T cells. We show that S1P signals through S1PR1, with coupling through Gai. In contrast to CCR7, which signals through Gai to induce sustained Rac1 activation, S1PR1 engagement yields only weak and transient Rac1 activation; the dominant response is sustained activation of RhoA. This pathway, together with a pathway involving phospholipase C and myosin light chain kinase, results in phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) and enhanced myosin contractility. Inhibition of mTORC2 blocks MLC phosphorylation, consistent with evidence that tension sensing by mTORC2 can couple Rac1 and RhoA signaling during leukocyte migration. Surprisingly, although RhoA pathway inhibitors blocked S1P-induced MLC phosphorylation and blebbing, they failed to block S1P-dependent chemotaxis. This led to the identification of a second arm of the S1P response: WNK1-dependent phosphorylation of SPAK1 and OSXR1, proteins that regulate ion channels and water influx. Partial WNK1 inhibition, together with inhibition of myosin contractility, was sufficient to block S1P-induced blebbing and chemotaxis, indicating that S1P-driven T cell migration involves coordinate activation of myosin contractility and water influx.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

However, this view has evolved significantly with growing evidence showing that some GPCRs continue to signal from endosomes after their internalization as well as from other intracellular organelles. The vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) exemplifies this paradigm shift as it promotes robust endosomal G protein before being sorted to lysosomes for degradation. Intriguingly, recent observations suggest that the lysosomal surface itself holds a substantial pool of heterotrimeric G proteins, raising the possibility that GPCRs such as the V2R may stimulate signaling from this subcellular region. To investigate this, we here employed a NanoBiT bystander approach to track intracellular V2R trafficking and transducer activation in real-time. Our results show that activated V2R is trafficked relatively fast to lysosomes where it retains the ability to couple to both G proteins and {beta}arrs. Applying nanobody/intrabody biosensors, we further demonstrated that the V2R activates endogenous G proteins and {beta}arrs at the lysosomal surface and that inhibition of V2R translocation to endolysosomal compartments blunts its ability to stimulate G protein signaling. Together, these findings suggest that the lysosomal surface serves as an unappreciated hub for signaling by some GPCRs before they eventually are engulfed into the lysosomal lumen for degradation.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

While their importance in supporting fish assemblages is widely accepted, an assessment of intertidal oyster reefs at night remains a knowledge gap. Documenting habitat use at night could reveal new species reliant on these systems and help uncover diel fish movements among structured and unstructured habitats. We hypothesise that habitat use will interact with time and habitat, whereby differences in fish assemblages between oyster reef and unstructured habitats would be greater during the day. In this study, we used infrared-capable remote underwater video stations (RUVS) to sample paired intertidal oyster reefs and unstructured habitat during day and night. Assemblages using these habitats during the day do not match those at night, consistent with diel shifts observed in similar habitats. Consistent with our hypothesis, during the day oyster reefs had higher diversity and richness than unstructured habitat, whereas both habitats had low diversity and richness at night. The high relative abundance of piscivores in oyster reefs during the day suggests reefs create food webs that extend beyond benthic matter and sustain higher trophic levels. Nighttime abundances and diversity in oyster reefs dropped to levels similar to those of unstructured habitats during the day and night, likely a product of temporal niche partitioning and dynamic predation risks. Nighttime studies were important in documenting a wider suite of species and can thus provide a more complete understanding of fish-habitat interactions. Furthermore, this study used novel methods that enabled depth and size estimation from a single camera unit. While still in its infancy, this can serve as a force multiplier in monitoring intertidal habitats and lead towards a cost-effective method for standardising day/night abundance measurements and obtaining fish size estimates.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

In monoclonal, single-descendant lineages indoors, duckweed supported higher aphid reproduction and suffered decreased fitness when their ancestors encountered aphids five generations earlier. Gene expression and metabolite profiling suggest transgenerational priming as underlying mechanism: duplicated L-tyrosine decarboxylase genes elevated tyramine levels, an adaptive response as tyramine supplementation suppressed aphid reproduction. Contrary, transgenerational jasmonate priming was maladaptive, as methyl-jasmonate application enhanced aphid reproduction. Remarkably, in a two-year outdoor mesocosm experiment with monoclonal S. polyrhiza populations of up to one million individuals, transgenerational tyramine priming persisted, whereas transgenerational jasmonate priming and its costs disappeared.

C.; Orr, M. C.; Seltmann, K. C.; Swain, A.; Vasconcelos, T.", "abstract": "Bees are dominant pollinators across native and agricultural plant communities, yet the drivers of their patterns of geographic distribution and functional diversity remain poorly understood. Notably, bees exhibit a bimodal latitudinal diversity gradient, peaking in species diversity in temperate and arid regions rather than the tropics despite their close ecological and evolutionary ties to flowering plants, which show the opposite pattern. Here, we investigated whether two key life history traits thought to shape where bees can live--sociality and nesting strategy--may influence this pattern. We compiled data on sociality and nesting strategy for 4,293 bee species and combined it with a comprehensive phylogeny, curated global occurrence records, and newly-developed models of trait evolution to test 1) whether sociality and nesting biology are evolutionarily correlated, 2) how these life history traits shape bees' climatic niches and niche breadths, and 3) whether the evolutionary dynamics of these traits may explain the bimodal latitudinal gradient in bee diversity. We find that the evolution of above-ground nesting is closely tied to the evolution of social behavior, but this trait combination has evolved rarely across the evolutionary history of bees. Where this combination does arise, species that are both social and above-ground nesters tend to have narrower climatic niches and are associated with environments that are warmer, wetter, and experience little seasonal temperature variation, making them more prevalent in tropical bee communities. Together, our results indicate that the bimodal diversity gradient in bees is driven by phylogenetic niche conservatism, where most bee lineages retain ancestral traits suited to arid environments and the derived syndrome necessary for thriving in the tropics evolves rarely.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

To fill this gap, we simulated partially clonal populations over 10,000 generations across a range of clonality and mutation rates. Using a forward-in-time individual-based model, we evaluated genetic and genotypic indices alongside measures of clone age distribution to examine how different clonality rates influence clone age distributions, and how these distributions impact population structure and genetic diversity over time. Our results reveal two distinct trajectories: (i) at low to moderate rates of clonality evolution is driven by sharp and predictable patterns of rapid clone turnovers, resulting in predominantly young clones which relative abundances well align with genotypic indices ; (ii) at extreme rates of clonality, demographic stochasticity generates very variable clone age distributions which mirror the high variance of mean and variance of FIS that summarize gene reshuffling between individuals. Interestingly, a portion of the variability of these indices can be explained by differences in clone age distribution that occur by chance. Our results, therefore, complement previous theoretical studies on the population genetics of partial clonality by providing biological insights into how clonal turnover dynamics shape the temporal evolution and variability of highly clonal populations. These results have practical implications for inferring evolutionary trajectories and managing partially clonal species.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Among amino acids, glutamine is uniquely positioned to influence this transition by coupling energy production to macromolecule biosynthesis and epigenetic regulation. We reasoned that myoblasts must sense glutamine availability to ensure orderly progression toward commitment, and we tested this by examining the molecular consequences of acute glutamine withdrawal. We find that continued glutamine oxidation is required to sustain glycolysis, maintain mitochondrial fission, and preserve a redox balance that supports progression towards myogenic commitment. In its absence, myoblasts undergo a reductive shift, characterized by mitochondrial elongation, membrane depolarization, and suppression of glycolysis, ultimately leading to growth arrest. Transcriptomic profiling reveals reduced MyoD and MKi67, accompanied by increased Sprouty1 levels, defining a reversible non-proliferative state that resembles but is distinct from quiescent and reserve cells. We term this state Poised Metabolic Arrest (PMA), a cellular response to glutamine limitation during myogenic progression. Mechanistically, PMA is driven by Nrf2-dependent increased glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and upregulation of mitochondrial GSH carrier Slc25a39 when glutamine is limited. Depleting mitochondrial glutathione or silencing Slc25a39 forces exit from PMA. However, this premature exit compromises subsequent differentiation potential, indicating PMA serves to preserve differentiation competence when glutamine is limited. Consistent with this, both loss and overexpression of Slc25a39 impair myoblast differentiation in vitro and disrupt regeneration in vivo. Together, these data suggest that a reciprocal Slc25a39-Nrf2 redox axis functions as a nutrient-dependent checkpoint, coupling glutamine availability to mitochondrial remodeling and metabolic reprogramming, necessary to establish irreversible myogenic commitment.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

We further compare the baseline result of our VID-Network with other representative approaches, our baseline method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on almost all the evaluation criteria.

While these compendiums have coverage of many biological samples, there are many additional biological samples that have gene expression data but lack epigenetic mark data and chromatin state annotations. The EpiAtlas resource of the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) contains a large compendium of chromatin state annotations for which many samples have matched gene expression data, which provides the opportunity to use it to train models to predict chromatin state annotations in additional biological samples with only gene expression data available. To address this, we develop Gene Expression-based Chromatin State Imputation (GECSI), which uses a multi-class logistic regression model trained using a large compendium of gene expression and chromatin state annotations, and apply it to IHEC data. Using cross-validation, we find that GECSI accurately predicts chromatin state assignments and generates probability estimates that are predictive of observed chromatin states, overall outperforming multiple other alternative and baseline methods. GECSI-predicted chromatin states reflect relationships among biological samples and show similar transcription factor and gene annotation enrichments as observed chromatin states.

In this study, we employed Metabolic-STAMP (Synchronized Temporal-Spatial Analysis via Microscopy and Phosphoproteomics) in both mouse {beta} cells (MIN6) and primary human islets to map the dynamic signaling networks governing GSIS and to link transient phosphorylation events to their functional outcomes. We systematically interrogated GPCR-mediated phosphorylation events through selective pharmacological inhibitors, resolving signaling hierarchies and consensus patterns across multiple pathways. Our multi-modal approach uncovered key insulin-secretion-associated PTMs, linked phosphorylation targets with phenotypic organelle dynamics, and provided mechanistic insights into how GLP1-R versus FFAR4 modulates GSIS through shared and GPCR-specific phospho-signatures. We highlighted key examples of stimulus-specific regulation by high glucose alone versus GPCR stimulation, including context-specific activation of the classic ERK signaling pathway, compartmentalized PKA signaling, pathway specificity in organelle dynamics and inter-organellar contacts, and HDAC6/ATAT-mediated regulation of microtubule acetylation.

Striga infestation of sorghum and soil seedbank levels were negatively correlated with clay content and the nutrients potassium, sulfur, calcium, and carbon. Microbiome analyses indicated that fungal communities were more responsive than bacteria to changes in Striga infestation and seedbank levels, with distinct microbial compositions even in soils where Striga was not detected. Specific fungal and bacterial genera showed both positive and negative correlations with Striga measures, but patterns rarely held across taxonomic levels, highlighting the complexity of microbiome-Striga interactions.

Yet, the allocation of elements to these proteins, and subsequent implications for biogeochemical processes, remain poorly characterized. Here we integrate elemental measurements with metaproteomics to quantitatively examine elemental use in Southern Ocean microbial proteins and metabolic processes. We demonstrate that iron availability influences elemental allocation, including decreased iron allocation to photosynthesis and compensatory incorporation of non-iron metals into metalloproteins under iron scarcity. Manganese was primarily allocated to photosynthesis in iron-replete conditions, and reallocated to other metabolic roles under low iron. Photosystem I:II protein mass ratios impacted both iron and manganese allocation, and appeared to be driven by iron availability. Approximately half of biogenic copper was found in plastocyanin, likely substituting for iron-containing cytochromes in photosynthesis. Moreover, biogenic nitrogen to phosphorus ratios were decoupled from ribosomal abundance, contrary to prevailing assumptions about ribosomal influence on stoichiometric regulation in the ocean. Instead, our results suggest that community composition and intracellular storage are important regulators of N:P in the Southern Ocean.

Supercoiling is involved in all biological processes that occur on DNA. Despite this involvement, single-molecule in vitro studies on these processes largely work with relaxed DNA, overlooking the role supercoiling is playing in these processes. We have constructed 18-kb linear DNA substrates that can be tethered to a microscope coverslip at multiple sites, allowing the template to be topologically constrained. We can then use an intercalating dye to induce positive or negative supercoiling, which we can observe at the single-molecule level using TIRF microscopy. We directly visualise plectonemes diffusing along the DNA. However, in the presence of the restriction enzyme EcoRV, plectonemes remain stationary at the EcoRV binding site. We show that EcoRV has an increased cleavage efficiency in the presence of supercoiling, even though its binding efficiency is unaffected. These findings reveal a relationship between DNA topology and the activity of DNA modifying enzymes. We hypothesise that supercoiling makes cleavage more energetically favourable for restriction enzymes that bend DNA.

In the Sugen-hypoxia (SuHx) rat model, hepatic MYDGF expression was decreased, while pulmonary vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression was increased. Human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells exposed to pro-inflammatory macrophage conditioned media downregulated MYDGF, and recombinant MYDGF restored pulmonary artery endothelial cell resistance to inflammatory activation via MAP4K4/NF{kappa}B signaling.

In budding yeast the double ring is made by two arrays of circumferential septin filaments at the two sides of the bud neck, which are thought to compartmentalize the membrane around the cleavage site. Integrity of the double septin ring requires the anillin Bud4 and its presumed partner Bud3, which associate with septins in mitosis and have separate, yet unknown, roles in stabilizing septin circumferential filaments. Through in vitro reconstitution assays using purified proteins, we show that Bud3 and Bud4 organise septin filaments in distinct ways, while together they cooperate to assemble higher-order septin networks. In agreement with their separate roles in septin organization, Bud3 and Bud4 bind to different septins and require septins to associate with each other, indicating that they modulate septin architecture independently but synergistically. We also provide evidence that Bud3 and Bud4 bind membranes in vivo and in vitro, consistent with the presence of lipid-binding domains in their primary sequence. Using bud3 bud4 double mutants that lack the septin double ring, we show that in vivo proteins marking cytokinetic remnants require the double ring to efficiently concentrate at the division site, while other proteins landing at the bud neck at cytokinesis are unaffected. Thus, we propose that a septin double ring may imprint a selective spatial memory for cytokinesis that is transmitted throughout subsequent cell divisions.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

C.; Wylie, D. C.; Lapp, H. E.; Salazar, M.; Margolis, A. E.; Champagne, F. A.", "abstract": "Environmental exposures co-occurring during early life have a profound influence on neurodevelopment. Our previous work in rats suggests that postnatal maternal care modulates the effects of prenatal exposure to bisphenols, an estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical, on offspring neurodevelopment. Elevated postnatal maternal licking/grooming and prenatal bisphenol exposure have known opposing effects on estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1) expression in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the hypothalamus, which could impact expression of estrogen-responsive genes. Opposing effects on DNA methylation of Esr1 have also been observed as a consequence of these exposures, with potentially broad transcriptional effects. Based on this previous work, we hypothesized that postnatal maternal licking/grooming would mitigate the effects of prenatal bisphenol exposure on Esr1 expression and estrogen-responsive genes in the developing MPOA. In addition, we hypothesized that there would be interactive effects of prenatal bisphenol exposure and postnatal maternal licking/grooming on DNA methylation, particularly nearby estrogen responsive elements. We administered either a bisphenol mixture (BPA, BPF, BPS), BPA only, or a corn oil control to pregnant rat dams. Postnatal maternal care was measured using home-cage videos. Brains from male and female pups were collected at postnatal day 10 and the transcriptome and DNA methylome were assessed in the MPOA. Our results indicated a significant interaction between prenatal bisphenol exposure and maternal postnatal licking/grooming on estrogen-related receptor gamma (Esrrg) expression, exclusively in female pups. These interactions were also evident in co-expression gene profiles in female pups; the majority of which were enriched for estrogen-responsive genes. Finally, DNA methylation analyses indicated that adding postnatal maternal licking/grooming as a covariate influenced the number of differentially methylated regions for prenatal bisphenol-exposed male and female pups. While these differentially methylated regions were not enriched for estrogen responsive elements, there were binding motifs for transcription factors that are known to interact with estrogen receptors, suggesting some secondary effects on postnatal gene regulation. These results suggest a novel biological mechanism in which postnatal maternal care can mitigate the negative neurodevelopmental impacts of prenatal bisphenol exposure.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

In this study we found that Mb expression which is driven by iron restriction and high sGC activation in iron deficiency anemia (IDA) leaches out more into the serum relative to non-anemic WTs. Tissues from IDA mice of both models developed either by nutritional iron deprivation or by ablation of ferroportin (Fpn) gene or from iron refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) mice found that Mb expression follows a variable pattern in different tissues but always correlates to the status of the sGC heterodimer or its subsequent activation. Here higher Mb expression happening in anemic (IDA, Fe<5 ppm or IDA, Fpn) or non-anemic WT mice is both due to iron restriction and an elevated sGC heterodimer that corroborated with greater sGC activation. More importantly we find significant leaching of Mb into the serum of these anemic (IDA) mice from both models and our spectral data suggests that this Mb is heme-free. This Mb leaching in anemia is a cumulative impact of Mb secreting out from various tissues including lungs, spleen, skeletal or cardiac muscles where Mb is expressed and not just in the skeletal muscles where Mb expression is low. Based on these findings we construct a working model of anemia, where high activation of sGC under anemic conditions (Fpn ablation or restricted Fe diet) induces Apo-Mb or heme-free Mb expression which can then leach out into the serum. Our findings of Mb leaching are novel and can find further application as a diagnostic strategy in anemia.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

While deep learning (DL) models show promise in FOG detection, their robustness and generalization across subtypes are limited by data scarcity and imbalances between FOG/non-FOG classes and among subtypes. To address this, we propose a subtype-aware FOG augmentation technique enabling training of DL models to perform consistently across subtypes. Specifically, we introduce Hierarchical Coarse-to-Fine conditional Generative Adversary Network (Hi-CF cGAN), a two-stage model that generates subtype-conditioned FOG-like ankle accelerations that are realistic and diverse, as verified through visualization, UMAPs, and Maximum Mean Discrepancy comparison against real signals. We evaluate its effectiveness by training CNNs for FOG detection with both general (subtype-stratified) and personalized (subtype-variant, based on patient-specific subtype composition) augmentation via Hi-CF cGAN, benchmarking against classical augmentations and baseline (no augmentation). Compared to baseline, general augmentation with Hi-CF cGAN effectively improves average detection rates of FOG, trembling FOG, and especially the previously overlooked minor subtypes, shuffling FOG (from 66.8% to 81.6%) and akinesia FOG (from 58.7% to 77.9%). These improvements exceed those of classical augmentations, demonstrating superior realism, richness, and adaptability of Hi-CF cGAN-generated data in addressing FOG/non-FOG and subtype imbalances. Personalized augmentation further enhances accuracy on targeted subtype(s) compared to general augmentation, highlighting its potential for tailored model optimization.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

We introduce Maketube, a method for evolving realistic genomes of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex with the full diversity of variants verified in natural isolates, and describe benchmarking results using Maketube-evolved genomes. We document that Maketube-evolved genomes satisfyingly mimic Mtbc complex genomes. Using Maketube-evolved genomes, we show that genome aligners miss up to 7.5% of the variants, which implies that benchmarkings with natural de novo assembled genomes are biased. Second, we show that recall of popular variant calling pipelines MTBseq, TB-Profiler, and our in-house genomic pipeline genotube, was overestimated by 1 to 10% in benchmarkings relying on simplistic in silico-evolved genomes, and that slight but significant differences in performance exist between pipelines. Finally, we provide evidence that variants are missed in duplicated regions and in regions flanking sequences absent in the reference (displaced insertion sequences or sequences deleted during the evolution of the reference). Altogether, realistic in silico-evolved genomes such as Maketube-derived ones are precious tools for reliable genomic tools benchmarking.

This 8S complex represents a basal component to drive membrane curvature via higher-order interactions. The biophysical mechanisms behind the membrane remodeling, however, have remained elusive. To address this shortcoming, we have developed a new bottom-up coarse-grained model to overcome the substantial computational limitations for this large system. During simulations with the coarse-grained model, the complexes increasingly coordinate as partially mediated by attractive electrostatic interactions between scaffolding domains. The coordination of complexes strongly correlates with membrane protrusion, as approaching complexes amplify localized stress in the exoplasmic leaflet. Thus, proximity of two CAV1-8S complexes induces dynamic curvature generation that can facilitate access for signaling partners. This mechanism is further explored in clusters of multiple CAV1-8S complexes that form large-scale membrane invaginations.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Despite this, many TFs implicated in disease have disordered structures and lack canonical binding pockets, rendering them non-trivial targets for small molecule-based therapies. Directly inhibiting TF function has proven difficult, but indirect inhibition by targeting the effector molecules that modulate TF function is a promising alternative strategy. Here we report a strategy for capturing cancer-specific protein-protein interactions using context-dependent uMap photoproximity labeling. Using an intein-based strategy for catalyst conjugation in biochemically intact nuclei, we demonstrate that we can capture unique protein interactomes of c-Myc in androgen receptor dependent and independent prostate cancer cell lines, and that these unique interactors can be mined to identify druggable vulnerabilities. We find that a PC-3 specific Myc interactor, SLK, selectively promotes c-Myc stabilization at the protein level, drives epithelial morphology and is essential for tumorigenesis, validating it as a viable therapeutic target. Importantly, this stabilization is driven by a change in SLK splicing rather than expression at the protein or RNA levels. Furthermore, analysis of cancer patient data shows a strong correlation between this splice isoform and expression of c-Myc targets, suggesting this novel regulatory axis is operative across human cancer.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

To identify key regulators of K+ nutrition in Arabidopsis, a genetic screen was performed using an pHAK5:LUC reporter line, and a mutant showing stable induction of the reporter under K+-sufficient conditions was isolated. Mapping-by-sequencing identified two linked mutations affecting genes involved in K+ and nitrate nutrition, namely a loss-of-function in the K+ uptake channel AKT1 and a gain-of-function allele of the nitrate transporter NPF6.2/NRT1.4 (NPF6.2V210M) that doubled the rate of nitrate transport. We report that the physical interaction of NPF6.2 and HAK5 transport proteins resulted in reciprocal interference. Co-expression in Xenopus oocytes of NPF6.2 with the regulatory kinase CIPK23 or the mutant protein NPF6.2V210M alone inhibited HAK5 transport, whereas HAK5 inhibited nitrate transport by NPF6.2 and NPF6.2V210M. We conclude that mutation NPF6.2V210M enhanced the nutritional defects associated to the loss of AKT1 function through the inhibition of HAK5.

For instance, complete respiration of a sugar is replaced by its fermentation. We derive the conditions for this to happen, using a core model of metabolism and growth that is qualitatively in agreement with experimental data. Assuming a fixed cellular protein content, the model shows that protein expression of efficient metabolism and anabolism rises as function of growth rate until a critical value is reached. This growth-associated protein expression is at the expense of proteins associated with future adaptation. At the critical growth rate, this preparatory pool is reduced to zero. Beyond the critical growth rate, the anabolic protein pool and the energy demand continue to rise and therefore less protein remains for catabolism. In this regime, the inefficient metabolism gradually takes over ATP synthesis from the efficient mode. It can do so if it requires less protein per unit of ATP flux. The catabolic protein pool then decreases while the anabolic pool increases. This continues until all catabolic protein is allocated to the inefficient strategy and to anabolism. We show that this can occur only if the maximal growth rate of the inefficient mode is higher than the critical growth rate. We show that this condition is precisely the requirement for the second mode to be more proteome-efficient than the first mode. Finally, we reduce a genome-scale model of protein expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a variant of our core model and show that it is still qualitatively in agreement with the experimental data used to validate the original model.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses have been implicated in protection, but the durability and quality of human immune responses in immunocompetent adults remain poorly defined. We investigated the development of immunity in two healthy US adults following primary cryptosporidiosis acquired during travel to Bangladesh. Longitudinal plasma samples were analyzed for antibody responses to Cryptosporidium antigens Cp17 and Cp23 and for circulating cytokine profiles. Circulating antibody peaked at three weeks post-infection but declined rapidly thereafter, approaching baseline within 16 weeks. In contrast, antibody avidity increased steadily over time, consistent with ongoing affinity maturation in germinal centers. While affinity maturation occurred, the composition memory B cells specific to Cryptosporidium antigens was skewed toward IgM+ cells across timepoints suggesting extrafollicular responses dominated and germinal center-derived, class-switched memory was limited. Cytokine profiling revealed an acute Th1-skewed response, with elevations in CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-27, IFNg, IL-12, and IL-18 during early infection. These signatures mirrored protective pathways identified in murine models, underscoring the importance of type I immunity in parasite clearance. Together, these findings highlight that while antibody responses to Cryptosporidium are short-lived, avidity maturation persists, and Th1-driven cytokine responses dominate during acute infection.

Upon cell entry, translation of the virus genome is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Despite early identification of the poliovirus IRES, structure determination has been hampered by the flexibility and complexity of the RNA (~450 nt, five structured domains), the requirement for almost all of the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and additional dependency on PCBP2 for trans-activation. As a result, there is little mechanistic information on how enterovirus Type 1 IRESs recruit and direct translational machinery. To address this, here we reconstitute human translation initiation on a model poliovirus IRES and examine 48S complexes by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Our structures reveal a novel set of interactions between the IRES and the translation machinery. Domain IVc contacts uS19 and uS13 on the small ribosomal subunit, and the conserved apical GNRA tetraloop interacts directly with the initiator tRNA during start-codon recognition. We demonstrate that disruption of these contacts causes defects in IRES-driven translation and virus replication.

To gain insight into the regulatory consequences of LINC00473 acquisition, we tested the cellular function of the conserved mouse promoter. We found that the homologous mouse promoter is induced by CREB and regulates the downstream Pde10a gene in C2C12 myoblast-like cells and neurons. Activation of this promoter by CRISPRa increased Pde10a transcript and protein levels, and proteomics revealed that elevated Pde10a promoted C2C12 differentiation at the expense of proliferation. Activation of Pde10a by CRISPRa also impaired CREB-dependent gene expression, suggesting that the mouse homolog of the LINC00473 promoter drives a CREB-Pde10a feedback loop. In contrast to the mouse homolog, human LINC00473 promoter activation by CRISPRa increased LINC00473 expression with either no change in PDE10A or delayed induction compared to mice.

To examine the evolutionary divergence of TBP homologs in different species, we determined the ability of murine TBP and its paralogs to complement endogenous TBP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite their highly conserved DNA-binding domains, murine TBP homologs were unable to fully rescue the lethality caused by TBP inactivation in yeast. This incomplete complementation correlates with a failure to fully support binding by RNA Pols II and III.

Our annotation pipeline demonstrates three key properties of SAE features that make them a useful source of functional annotation complementary to existing methods.

Second, they can detect missing annotations by finding proteins that display recognizable structural motifs but lack corresponding database labels.

D.; Sanders, C.", "abstract": "Ordered membrane nanodomains colloquially known as lipid rafts have many proposed cellular functions. However, pharmacological tools to modulate protein affinity for rafts and to manipulate raft formation are currently lacking. We screened 24,000 small molecules for compounds that impact the raft affinity of a known raft-preferring protein, peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), in giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs). Hits were counter-screened against another raft protein, MAL, and also tested for their impact on raft stability. We identified three chemically distinct tools for manipulating lipid rafts. Two compounds were seen to both decrease PMP22 raft partitioning and to destabilize ordered domains (VU0607402 and VU0519975) while a third (primaquine diphosphate) increased PMP22 partitioning and stabilized ordered domains. While discovered in a PMP22-focused screen, all three were seen to modulate raft formation in a protein-independent manner by altering lipid-lipid interactions and membrane fluidity. Acute treatment of live cells with the raft destabilizing compound, VU0607402 was seen to modulate TRPM8 channel function, highlighting the utility of this compound in live-cell experiments for dissecting the role that membrane order and fluidity play in cell signaling. These compounds provide novel pharmacological tools for probing lipid raft properties and function in biophysical experiments and in living cells.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates, membrane-less organelles that arise from liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids, play vital roles in cellular organization and regulation. Computational modeling is crucial for uncovering the molecular mechanisms behind LLPS; however, the fluctuations across a wide range of spatial scales and the inherently non-equilibrium nature of these systems make capturing their long-timescale dynamics particularly challenging. Here, we present a continuum dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) framework that captures the non-equilibrium dynamics of LLPS by integrating a physics-based statistical mechanical theory with key experimentally-derived parameters. Our model couples DDFT with a continuum free energy functional, incorporating two-body correlations between monomers and surface tension effects to determine binodal densities under phase co-existence. By solving the DDFT equations, we describe the time evolution of phase-separated domains, capturing key long-timescale processes such as droplet maturation, coalescence, and interface relaxation, phenomena that are difficult to probe using atomistic or mesoscale coarse-grained simulations. This implementation integrates experimental phase equilibrium data with molecular-scale descriptors, such as amino acid properties, to construct a quantitative link between molecular interactions and macroscopic phase behavior. However, the approach is generalizable, providing a foundation for self-contained molecular-to-continuum modeling bridge platforms.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

D.; Chidomere, C. L.; Scott, K.; West, A. P.; Dantzer, R.", "abstract": "Cancer-related inflammation and metabolic alterations extend beyond the tumor microenvironment, exerting systemic effects that disrupt energy homeostasis and contribute to reduced physical function and chronic fatigue. The cGAS-STING pathway has emerged as a key regulator of innate immunity and inflammation; however, its role in cancer-associated fatigue remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the contribution of cGAS-STING-mediated inflammation to cancer- and/or its treatment-induced fatigue using a mouse model of human papillomavirus-related head and neck cancer. Wheel running activity, along with inflammatory and metabolic changes in tumor and liver tissues, were assessed following chemoradiotherapy and pharmacological inhibition of STING in tumor-bearing and tumor-free control mice. The results revealed that tumor growth and chemoradiotherapy activated the cGAS-STING pathway, together with an upregulation of proinflammatory mediators and alterations of mitochondrial and metabolic gene expression in the liver. To inhibit STING activation, mice were administered H-151, a specific STING antagonist. This intervention attenuated hepatic inflammatory signatures and mitigated tumor and/or chemoradiotherapy-associated behavioral fatigue measured by decreased voluntary wheel running. These findings implicate for the first time the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and metabolic homeostasis in cancer- and cancer therapy-related fatigue.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Diagnosis traditionally requires subjective histomorphologic assessment of a bone marrow biopsy sample. The potential biological and/or clinical relevance of subtle microarchitectural changes, unrecognizable using conventional methods, remains unknown. Here, we applied a recently developed AI-driven, whole slide imaging-based single-cell spatial proteomic profiling method to 77 annotated MDS and precursor state bone marrow tissue samples, including longitudinal cases. Compared to age-matched controls, MDS tissues showed significant changes in progenitor cell frequencies, morphologies of erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes, HSPC displacement from vasculature, abnormal progenitor cell clustering, and disrupted erythroid islands. Some alterations correlated more closely with specific mutations (e.g., SF3B1, TP53) than clinical risk scores (IPSS-M). Using all extracted tissue features, we developed a composite spatially informed MDS severity score, which aligned with clinical and genetic parameters across serial samples. This work uncovers previously unrecognized, genotype-linked microarchitectural alterations in MDS, the measurement of which may enhance existing diagnostic and disease monitoring strategies.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we generate cell type-specific translatomes of the Caenorhabditis elegans intestine during fasting and refeeding using discrete promoters for the anterior quartet of intestinal cells (INT1) and the remaining 8 pairs of intestinal cells (INT2-9). We found that the anterior-most INT1 cells are a translationally distinct intestinal sub-compartment that is particularly enriched for immune- and stress-response genes. Functional assays using novel INT1-specific genes emerging from this study reveal that these specialized cells play a previously unappreciated role in pathogen avoidance and organismal survival. A second critical function of INT1 cells is their role in sensing and responding to the contents of the gut lumen. We show that luminal pyruvate is the key signal linking bacterial nutrients in the gut, to secretion of the gut insulin antagonist INS-7. These findings establish INT1 as sentinel enteroendocrine cells that integrate metabolic and immune cues to couple food status with immune and endocrine responses. Our studies also provide a rich resource for dissecting segment-specific intestinal biology, an overlooked and fertile area for future research.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}

S. aureus strains carry one of four T7SSb locus types, named essC1 to essC4, each of which encodes a characteristic LXG-family substrate at the T7SS locus. In essC2 strains this LXG-domain protein is EsxX, which has a glycine zipper sequence in its C-terminus and has potent antibacterial membrane-depolarising activity. In this work we recognise conserved features of the essC2 and essC3 systems, identifying the LXG protein SAR0287 as structurally and functionally similar to EsxX. Using a zebrafish larval hindbrain ventricle infection model we demonstrate that the T7SSb of essC2 and essC3 representative strains contribute to bacterial replication and zebrafish mortality. However, there is no significant loss of virulence in the model system if EsxX or SAR0287 are absent. These findings indicate there is no discernible role for either toxin in this virulence model.", "date": "2025-10-04", "journal": ""}
