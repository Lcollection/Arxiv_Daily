M.; Delvigne, M.; Camprodon, A.; Vidal, J.; Courtier-Orgogozo, V.; Lang, M.", "abstract": "Left-right asymmetries have repeatedly evolved in diverse animals and affect the position, shape or size of specific organs. How novel left-right asymmetries arise remains unknown. Here, we examined Drosophila pachea, where males have evolved unique asymmetric genitalia lobes and a right-sided copulation posture in the past 3-6 million years. We found that male asymmetric lobes grow in pupae during a 360{degrees} clockwise genitalia rotation, a conserved and widespread developmental process in flies. Using two complementary approaches, drug application and a CRISPR-induced MyoID mutant, we altered genitalia rotation and found that asymmetric lobe sizes depend on genitalia rotation completion, while the sidedness of lobe asymmetry is determined by the rotation direction. We then investigated the impact of genital asymmetry on copulation posture. Males with reversed genital asymmetry still mate in the typical right-sided posture, indicating that right-sided behavior is not determined by asymmetric male genitalia. Our study reveals that a novel genitalia asymmetry has evolved through the co-option of a pre-existing tissue remodeling process. Tissue rotation represents a new mechanism, through which a bilateral organ can acquire a left-right size asymmetry.\n\nSummary statementHow asymmetric shapes evolve from symmetry is an important question in developmental biology. Using a juvenile hormone derivative, transgenics and CRISPR mutants in the non model species Drosophila pachea, we uncover that the developmental process of male genitalia rotation got co-opted during evolution of D. pachea to determine the extent and direction of a novel genital left-right asymmetry.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Through a genetic screen in yeast, we discovered a surprising role for Mediator CKM in the DNA damage response (DDR) and mitotic re-entry. Remarkably, we find that a single DNA break is sufficient for CKM-dependent global transcriptional attenuation. Upon DDR activation, the kinase activity of CKM antagonizes RNAPII binding to core Mediator, thereby reducing the transcriptionally-engaged RNAPII pool. This transcriptional attenuation is essential for DDR inactivation and limits the spreading of g-H2AX into gene bodies. Furthermore, CKM localizes to DNA breaks to impede RNAPII binding. Importantly, we demonstrate that the role of CKM on DDR and transcriptional attenuation is conserved from yeast to mammals, establishing a multifaceted and essential function for CKM in transcriptional regulation of DNA-damage response.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

M.; Worbes, M.", "abstract": "Background and aims: The large grove-forming tropical tree Microberlinia bisulcata (Fabaceae subfamily Detarioideae) in southern Korup, SW Cameroon, displays strong mast fruiting. The soil is poor in phosphorus and potassium: the climate is strongly seasonal. Evidence is presented that masting is probably determined primarily by mineral nutrients and secondarily by radiation. Method and materials: Field data on phenology and climate variation (1989 to 2017), and soil moisture, nutrients in litter and fruits, insect herbivory and tree growth are integrated. Some data come from previous studies at Korup, and they are combined with new data to enable an extended analysis. Key results: To test the nutrient resource limitation hypothesis, phenological recordings were matched with climate variables and modelled using logistic and time-series regressions. A strong predictor was average daily rainfall in the dry season, low in the current year of masting and high in the year prior. Less strong was the increase in dry season radiation between prior and mast years. Masting events showed no relationship to annual stem increment. Masting was reduced after two caterpillar attacks. Fallen-leaf phosphorus concentration increased in the inter-mast interval and that for potassium peaked mid-interval. These elements were likely accumulating and being stored, triggering masting when internal thresholds were crossed. A drier dry season prior to masting may have increased tree carbon, the wetter one increased nutrient acquisition and uptake via roots and mycorrhizas. A rooting-fruiting trade-off in carbon is proposed. Storage of phosphorus may be mostly in bark of branches; that for potassium on soil organic colloids. Conclusion: The long-term driver appears to be stochastic dry-season rainfall. Synchrony across masting trees might be enhanced by equilibration of nutrients across the mycorrhizal-root network. Life history strategy determined by mineral nutrient resource dynamics provides the best explanation and an advanced model for the observed pattern of masting events.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Unfortunately, traditional methods to quantify phage success can be time-consuming, limiting the throughput of experiments. Here, we use theory to show how the effects of phages on their hosts can be quantified using bacterial population dynamics measured in a high-throughput microplate reader (automated spectrophotometer). We use mathematical models to simulate bacterial population dynamics where specific phage and bacterial traits are known a priori. We then test common metrics of those dynamics (e.g. growth rate, time and height of peak bacterial density, death rate, extinction time, area under the curve) to determine which best predict: 1) infectivity over the short-term, and 2) phage suppression over the long-term. We find that many metrics predict infectivity and are strongly correlated with one another. We also find that metrics can predict phage growth rate, providing an effective way to quantify the combined effects of multiple phage traits. Finally, we show that peak density, time of peak density, and extinction time are the best metrics when comparing across different bacterial hosts or over longer timescales where plasticity or evolution may play a role. In all, we establish a foundation for using bacterial population dynamics to quantify the effects of phages on their bacterial hosts, supporting the design of in vitro empirical experiments using microplate readers.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to high-impact journals because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work.

Two pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IL1{beta}, that trigger barrier disruption in brain endothelial cells (BECs) in vitro and are upregulated in stroke, contribute to Rab7a activation. Silencing Rab7a in vitro partially rescues cytokine-driven barrier disruption in BECs by reducing internalization of some junctional proteins and the formation of F-actin bundles at cell junctions.

This represents the first systematic analysis of shape readout in DNMT3 enzymes and demonstrates how flanking sequence specificity is dynamically encoded by two nearly identical proteins.

Ca2+ sensitivity of the four CaMKII paralogs in mammals has been linked to the length of the variable linker region that is a hot spot for alternative splicing. In this study, we determined that the position of charged residues within the linker modulates the Ca2+/CaM sensitivity. We present an X-ray crystal structure of the full-length CaMKII{delta} holoenzyme consisting of domain-swapped dimers within a dodecameric complex. In this structure, the kinase domain of one subunit is docked onto the hub domain of an adjacent subunit, providing an additional interface within the holoenzyme. Mutations at the hub equatorial and lateral interfaces led to alterations in the stoichiometry of CaMKII holoenzyme as well as Ca2+/CaM sensitivity. Using molecular dynamics (MD) to compare domain-swapped to non-domain-swapped CaMKIIs, we demonstrate that the domain-swapped conformation facilitates an interaction between the calmodulin binding region and the linker region. Based on MD simulations and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, we propose a model where the position of charges on the linker region drives an interaction with the regulatory segment that modulates the degree of autoinhibition. Finally, we use live-cell imaging to show that the activation profiles we observe in vitro are recapitulated in cells.

These are thought to be produced by failures in multisensory integration mechanisms, commonly observed as enlarged temporal binding windows during audiovisual illusion tasks. To our knowledge, there is an absence of computational explanations for multisensory integration deficits in patients with schizophrenia and individuals with high schizotypy, particularly at the neurobiological level. We implemented a multisensory causal inference network to reproduce the responses of individuals who scored low in schizotypy in a simulated double flash illusion task. Next, we explored the effects of recurrent excitation, cross-modal and feedback weights, and synaptic density on the visual illusory responses of the network. Using quantitative fitting to empirical data, we found that an increase in the weights of the recurrent excitatory connectivity in the network enlarges the temporal binding window and increases the overall proneness to experience the illusion, matching the responses of individuals scoring high in schizotypy. Moreover, we found that an increase in excitation increases the probability of inferring a common cause from the stimuli. We propose an E/I imbalance account of reduced temporal discrimination in the SCZ spectrum and discuss possible links with Bayesian theories of schizophrenia. We highlight the importance of adopting a multisensory causal inference perspective to address body-related symptomatology of schizophrenia.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Synergistic reductions by the miRNA-mimic pairs were observed for the 3'-UTRs of common target genes with miRNA-responsive elements (MREs) preferentially located at a distance of 200-800bp. Deletion of either of the miRNA seed sequences resulted in a loss of synergism. Furthermore, we performed small RNA-sequencing to identify significantly downregulated miRNAs in Oral cancer. Consequently, we transfected let-7c-5p and miR-125b-5p miRNA mimics either alone or in combination at half-dose concentrations and determined the expression levels of their common and unique target genes in oral cancer cells. Significant reductions in target gene expression were observed for genes containing MREs for both miRNA mimics within the preferential distance. Proteomic data revealed that the let-7c-5p and miR-125b-5p miRNA-mimic pairs synergistically reduced the expression of their common target genes, hexokinase 2 (HK2) and branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1), in cancer cells. However, unique target genes did not exhibit any significant alterations in their protein levels. The effect of HK2 and BCAT1 downregulation was also reflected in the metabolomic profiling of cancer cells, specifically affecting glycolysis and the BCAA degradation pathways. As a result of the metabolic impairment caused by the synergistic effect of miRNA mimic pairs, oral cancer cells showed a significant reduction in proliferation, migration, and spheroid formation compared to cells treated with either single miRNA.

Using spatial multi-omics analyses, we identified a population of myeloid-instructed CD14+ T cells present in both the tumor core and adjacent non-malignant lung tissue of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CD4+ T cells acquired CD14 from myeloid cells by trogocytosis, resulting in an atypical T cell phenotype.

The aim of this study was to monitor circulating HPV cfDNA levels in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer during treatment and follow-up, assessing the utility of HPV cfDNA as a tumor marker for disease surveillance and in guiding clinical treatment decisions. Experimental Design: In this prospective pilot observational study, levels of HPV cfDNA in serum samples from 28 patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV-positive cervical cancer were measured via digital droplet polymerase chain reaction. Results for HPV cfDNA levels were matched to clinical outcomes and to serum levels of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) to assess the clinical potential of HPV cfDNA as a tumor marker. Results: HPV cfDNA was detected in all 28 patients (100% detection rate). Notably, median baseline HPV cfDNA levels varied according to the metastatic pattern observed in individual patients (P=0.019). Patients with a combined multi-metastatic pattern (lymph node + hematogenous diffuse serosal metastasis) exhibited a higher median baseline HPV cfDNA level compared to those with a single-metastasis pattern (local recurrence, lymph node metastasis, or hematogenous metastasis) (P = 0.003). All participants exhibited changes in HPV cfDNA levels over a median monitoring period of 2 months (range 0.3 to 16.9 months) prior to evaluations for treatment response or disease progression. Among 26 patients initially diagnosed with squamous cell cervical cancer, the positivity rate was 100% for HPV cfDNA and 69.2% for SCC-Ag (P = 0.004, 95% confidence interval, 0-0.391).

We investigated the thermal adaptation dynamics of four species of budding yeast (Saccharomyces) and their interspecific F2 hybrids, for 140 generations under cold (5C) and warm (31C) conditions. We found significant variation in the evolutionary potential of species and hybrids, strongly determined by their natural temperature tolerance. The largest fitness improvements occurred in hybrids, with some populations nearly quadrupling in fitness in the cold environment, exceeding both parents in thermal adaptive potential. Reciprocal transplanting of evolved populations from the endpoint of evolution into opposite temperatures revealed that hybrids had greater resilience when challenged with sudden temperature shifts. Our results highlight that hybridization alters the fitness outcomes of long-term adaptation to extreme environments and may render populations more resilient to sudden environmental change, presenting both opportunities and challenges for conservation and sustainable agriculture.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Uptake of peptides by S. aureus involves at least two transport systems: the di/tripeptide permease DtpT and the oligopeptide ABC transporter Opp3. Here we study the individual and combined functions of DtpT and Opp3 in enabling utilisation of diverse di-/tripeptides via a high-throughput phenotypic screen. We reveal that DtpT is the primary route of uptake for dipeptides, and although many peptides can be utilised via either of the two transport systems, we demonstrate a clear preference for Asp/Glu-containing peptides among DtpT substrates. To better understand the substrate preferences of DtpT, the protein was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Active transport of diverse di- and tripeptides was demonstrated, supporting the conclusions of the phenotypic screen. During this in vitro analysis, we discovered that DtpT could transport the biologically prevalent tripeptide glutathione (GSH). Bacterial growth assays demonstrate that dtpT is essential for GSH utilisation in the absence of the known glutathione transporter, Gis, identifying DtpT as the second GSH uptake system of S. aureus. We demonstrate that GSH transport is required by S. aureus for complete fitness during in vitro macrophage infection experiments. Finally, based on analysis of the DtpT structure and identification of key residues needed for GSH binding and transport, we suggest that GSH transport may be conserved in the DtpT orthologue of Listeria monocytogenes. Together, these data reveal important new functions for DtpT in the utilisation of diverse peptides and point toward a novel role for DtpT (and, potentially, other bacterial POT proteins) in glutathione acquisition during intracellular infection.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

While studying these viruses, scientists developed a large amount of sequencing data that was made available to researchers. Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large databases of proteins and prior work has shown its use in studying the structure and function of proteins. This paper proposes an unsupervised framework for characterizing SARS-CoV-2 sequences using large language models. First, we perform a comparison of several protein language models previously proposed by other authors. This step is used to determine how clustering and classification approaches perform on SARS-CoV-2 sequence embeddings. In this paper, we focus on surface glycoprotein sequences, also known as spike proteins in SARS-CoV-2 because scientists have previously studied their involvement in being recognized by the human immune system. Our contrastive learning framework is trained in an unsupervised manner, leveraging the Levenshtein distance from pairwise alignment of sequences when the contrastive loss is computed by the Siamese Neural Network. The final part of this paper focuses on a comparison with a previous approach on a test dataset containing data from the latter part of the pandemic. In the prediction of emerging variants, the proposed LLM-based approach shows an improvement of 0.1914 in terms of the adjusted rand index clustering compared to a previously proposed approach.

It remains elusive how these heterogeneities relate to various RL algorithms proposed to be employed by animals/humans, such as RL under predictive state representation, hierarchical RL, and distributional RL. Here we demonstrate that these relationships can be coherently explained by incorporating the decay of learned values (value-decay), implementable by the decay of dopamine-dependent plastic changes in the synaptic strengths. First, we show that value-decay causes ramping RPE under certain state representations but not under others. This accounted for the observed gradual fading of dopamine ramping across repeated reward navigation, attributed to the gradual formation of predictive state representations. It also explained the cue-type and inter-trial-interval-dependent temporal patterns of dopamine. Next, we constructed a hierarchical RL model composed of two coupled systems - one with value-decay and one without. The model accounted for distinct patterns of neuronal activity in parallel striatal-dopamine circuits and their proposed roles in flexible learning and stable habit formation. Lastly, we examined two distinct algorithms of distributional RL with and without value-decay. These algorithms explained how distinct dopamine patterns across striatal regions relate to the reported differences in the strength of distributional coding. These results suggest that within-striatum differences - specifically, a medial-to-lateral gradient in value or synaptic decay - tune regional RL computations by generating distinct patterns of dopamine/RPE signals.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

A valuable framework to study it is provided by the Bimanual Load-Lifting Task (BLLT), in which voluntarily lifting a load supported by the opposite forearm is preceded by anticipatory inhibition of the elbow flexors in the supporting arm, preventing forearm instability. In sixteen adult participants performing the BLLT, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying anticipatory inhibition. Optimal postural stabilization was observed when the elbow flexor was inhibited around 30 ms before unloading. Stronger muscle inhibition in this optimal time interval was associated with reduced excitability - indexed by high-gamma (90-130 Hz) power - and increased high-beta (18-25 Hz) power in the contralateral Supplementary Motor Area (SMA). Mediation analysis revealed that high-gamma power reduction significantly mediates the relationship between high-beta power and anticipatory inhibition. We further showed that trials containing beta bursts (22-28 Hz) exhibit optimally timed anticipatory inhibition and a concurrent decrease in high-gamma power. Directed connectivity analysis using the Phase Slope Index demonstrated that these beta bursts propagate to the SMA from the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and the elbow-related primary motor cortex (M1), both of which increase their burst probability during SMA bursts. Together, our findings suggest that, during voluntary load-lifting, optimal anticipatory muscle inhibition in the load-supporting forearm is achieved through reduced SMA excitability, mediated by beta bursts originating from an lPFC-M1-SMA network. To our knowledge, this also provides the first evidence that beta bursts can exert direct inhibitory control over muscle function.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Using high-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA and ITS markers) across 72 samples, combined with mixed-effects modelling, source-tracking, microbiota assembly mechanisms investigation and network analysis we demonstrate that P. lythri disrupted bacterial community assembly processes, transitioning from deterministic to stochastic dynamics in the bulk soil, aligning with the Anna Karenina Principle.

We show that, for the relatively small sample size here, linear models perform just as well as non-linear models, including neural networks.

This study identifies C-terminal fluorescent protein tags that maintain ManS activity in the yeast to accelerate the Design, Build, Test, Learn cycles for polysaccharide biosynthesis. Using the Amorphophallus konjac ManS as a case study, we demonstrate that the enzyme co-localizes with a known yeast marker for the Golgi apparatus despite the toxic effects of plant glucomannan accumulation in Pichia pastoris.

Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) is one form of transcranial electric stimulation (tES) in which an alternating current is passed between electrodes at random frequencies. High-frequency tRNS (hf-tRNS) is thought to enhance excitability and has been reported to have facilitatory effects on behavior in healthy and clinical populations. Due to the potential application of tRNS, clear demonstrations of the efficacy and replicability of stimulation are critical. Here, we focused on replicating the facilitatory effect of hf-tRNS over the human middle temporal complex (hMT+) on contralateral motion processing, initially demonstrated by Ghin et al. (2018). In this prior study, the improvement in performance was specific to global motion processing in the visual field contralateral to stimulation. The motivation to replicate this effect was reinforced by the well-supported hypothesis that hMT+ is critical for contralateral global motion processing. However, our results indicated that hf-tRNS does not improve motion discrimination. Specifically, we were unable to replicate a contralateral global motion processing facilitation following hf-tRNS to hMT+. In our within-subject controls, we also found no difference between hf-tRNS to hMT+ on contralateral global motion processing in comparison to sham stimulation, or in comparison to hf-tRNS to the forehead. While it remains possible that our lack of replication could be due to minor changes in the protocol from the original Ghin et al., study, for hf-tRNS to become a widely applied method, the modulatory effect of hf-tRNS should be robust to slight adjustments to the procedure.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Movement vigor across multiple modalities increases with reward, suggesting that the neural circuits that represent value influence the control of movement. Dopaminergic neuron (DAN) activity has been suggested as the potential mediator of this response. If DAN activity is the bridge between value and vigor, then vigor should track canonical mediators of DAN activity, namely learning signals in the form of reward expectation and reward prediction error. Here we ask if a similar time-locked response is present in vigor of reaching movements. We explore this link by leveraging the known phasic dopaminergic response to stochastic rewards, where activity is modulated by both reward expectation at cue and the reward prediction error at feedback. We used probabilistic rewards to create a reaching task rich in reward expectation, reward prediction error, and learning. In one experiment, target reward probabilities were explicitly stated, and in the other, were left unknown and to be learned by the participants. We included two stochastic rewards (probabilities 33% and 66%) and two deterministic ones (probabilities 100% and 0%). In both experiments, outgoing peak velocity increased with increasing reward expectation. Furthermore, we observed a short-latency response in the vigor of the ongoing movement, that tracked reward prediction error: either invigorating or enervating velocity consistent with the sign and magnitude of the error. Reaching kinematics also revealed the value-update process in a trial-to-trial fashion, similar to the effect of prediction error signals typical in dopamine-mediated striatal phasic activity. Lastly, reach vigor increased with reward history over trials, mirroring the motivational effects often linked to fluctuating dopamine levels. Taken together, our results highlight the link between known short-latency dopaminergic learning signals and the invigoration of movement, not only at the time of cue presentation and movement initiation, but during an ongoing movement immediately after feedback is provided.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

The prokaryotic CNBD channel SthK has been a useful model for better understanding these allosteric mechanisms. Here, we applied time-resolved transition metal ion Forster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) to investigate the conformational dynamics and energetics in the CNBD of SthK in both a soluble C-terminal fragment of the protein, SthKCterm, and in the full-length channel, SthKFull. We incorporated the noncanonical amino acid Acd as a FRET donor and a metal bound to a chelator conjugated to a cysteine as an acceptor. We used time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) to measure time-resolved FRET and fit the TCSPC data to obtain donor-acceptor distance distributions in the absence and presence of cAMP. The distance distributions allowed us to quantify the energetics of coupling between the C-terminal domains and the transmembrane domains by comparing the donor-acceptor distance distributions for SthKCterm and SthKFull.

Yet, the mechanistic relationship among these roles is unknown. Here, we show DA's tripartite roles are causally linked by a process in which phasic striatal DA rapidly and persistently recalibrates the propensity to move, a measure of vigor. Using a self-timed movement task, we found that single exposures to reward-related DA transients (both endogenous and exogenously-induced) exerted one-shot updates to movement timing--but in a surprising fashion. Rather than reinforce specific movement times, DA transients quantitatively changed movement timing on the next trial, with larger transients leading to earlier movements (and smaller to later), consistent with a stochastic search process that calibrates the frequency of movement. Both abrupt and gradual changes in external and internal contingencies--such as timing criterion, reward content, and satiety state--caused changes to the amplitude of DA transients that causally altered movement timing. The rapidity and bidirectionality of the one-shot effects are difficult to reconcile with gradual synaptic plasticity, and instead point to more flexible cellular mechanisms, such as DA-dependent modulation of neuronal excitability.

Here, we use single-cell epigenomics to profile chromatin accessibility and gene expression across eight brain regions in the mouse brain at 2, 9, and 18 months of age. In addition to a significant decline in progenitor cell populations involved in neurogenesis and myelination, we observed widespread and concordant changes of transcription and chromatin accessibility during aging in glial and neuronal cell types. These alterations are accompanied by dysregulation of master transcription factors and a shift toward stress-responsive programs driven by AP-1, indicating a progressive loss of cell identity with aging. We also identify region- and cell-type-specific heterochromatin decay, characterized by increased accessibility at H3K9me3-marked domains, activation of transposable elements, and upregulation of long non- coding RNAs, particularly in glutamatergic neurons. Together, these results reveal age-related disruption of heterochromatin maintenance and transcriptional programs, identify vulnerable brain regions and cell types, and pinpoint key molecular pathways altered in brain aging.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

In the United Kingdom (UK) and in continental Europe, the H5N8 subtype predominated during the first epizootic wave of 2020/21, with few detections of H5N1. However, during the second (2021/22) and third (2022/23) epizootic waves, H5N1 was the dominant subtype. The rapid shift in dominance from H5N8 to H5N1 was likely driven by a combination of virological, immunological, and/or host-related factors. In this study, we compared viral fitness and immunological responses in ducks, a key reservoir species, using dominant genotypes of H5N1 (genotype AB) and H5N8 (genotype A) from the second wave. While viral shedding dynamics were similar for both viruses, H5N8 was more pathogenic. Antigenic analysis of post-infection duck sera revealed that the haemagglutinin (HA) protein was antigenically similar across clade 2.3.4.4b H5 HPAIVs, but neuraminidase (NA) proteins displayed different patterns of cross-reactivity. We also modelled a scenario where ducks were pre-exposed to H5N1 (genotype C) or H5N8 (genotype A) from the first wave and subsequently challenged with either homologous or heterologous subtypes from the second wave (genotype AB or A). Despite the absence of seroconversion, pre-exposure to different subtypes resulted in varying clinical outcomes following challenge. These findings indicate that both viral and immunological factors likely played significant roles in the emergence and spread of H5Nx HPAIVs in wild bird populations.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

To identify GRNs involved in GB pathogenesis, we applied the machine learning-based MOBILE (Multi-Omics Binary Integration via Lasso Ensembles) pipeline to integrate multi-omics data. GABA-signalling emerged as a previously unrecognized contributor to GB, involving relevant TFs as ARX, GSX2 and DLX family, key regulators of GABAergic interneuron development.

Dysregulation of splicing that affects pancreatic function, and immune tolerance has been linked to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Next-generation sequencing technologies, with their short read lengths, are limited in their ability to accurately detect splice variants. Long-read sequencing technologies offer the potential to overcome these limitations by providing full-length transcript information; however, their application in single-cell RNA sequencing has been hindered by technical challenges, including insufficient read lengths and higher error rates. Furthermore, cell types that produce high levels of a single transcript, such as islet endocrine cells, can obscure identification of lower abundance transcripts. In this study, we optimized a protocol for single-cell long-read sequencing in pancreatic islets to improve read length and transcript detection. Our findings demonstrate that 5' library preparation protocols outperform 3' protocols, resulting in better transcript identification. Furthermore, we show that targeted depletion of insulin transcripts enhances the detection of informative reads, highlighting the utility of transcript depletion strategies. This optimized protocol enables isoform-specific gene expression analysis and reveals differential transcript usage across the various cell types in pancreatic islets.

P.; Haris, M.; Reddy, R.", "abstract": "Precise demarcation of brain tumor boundaries is critical for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. In vivo characterization of tumor using PET/CT and MRI is clinical standard. PET/CT highlights the metabolic aspects of the tumor, while MRI provides information on functional, metabolic and structural changes. Even with technological advancements in both PET/CT and MRI, a method that can precisely delineate infiltrative tumor boundaries from normal-appearing brain regions (NABR) in vivo is still lacking. To address this limitation, we explored a relatively new MR imaging method, the Nuclear Overhauser Effect Magnetization Transfer Ratio (NOEMTR), in conjunction with a gadolinium-based contrast agent (Gd-DOTA), to precisely delineate the tumor boundaries in a rat model of infiltrative gliosarcoma. NOEMTR imaging was performed in the rat model (n=5) before and after Gd-DOTA administration. The post-Gd-DOTA NOEMTR map was subtracted from the pre-Gd-DOTA map and compared with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images and immuno-histological findings. The resulting NOEMTR difference map clearly highlighted both the tumor core and infiltrative boundaries, which was not discernible on the post-contrast T1-weighted images. The extended tumor boundaries observed on the NOEMTR difference map corroborated with the IHC image, which confirmed the presence of infiltrative tumor cells and macrophages in these regions. Guided by the NOEMTR difference map, regions of interest (ROI) were drawn to quantify NOEMTR signal changes in the tumor core, tumor boundaries, and NABR post-Gd-DOTA. Tumor core showed a significant [~]43% reduction in NOEMTR signal (p = 0.003), while the tumor periphery exhibited a moderate reduction of [~]10%, (p = 0.045). No appreciable change in was observed in the NABR (p = 0.371). In contrast, the post contrast T1-weighted signal changes in tumor core, tumor periphery and NABR were, 33.32% (p = 0.092), 3.8% (p = 0.478), and 8.7% (p = 0.464) respectively. These findings suggest that NOEMTR imaging provides enhanced tumor contrast, particularly at the infiltrative tumor margins, where conventional contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI may underestimate tumor extent. Histological validation confirmed the presence of infiltrative tumor cells and macrophages in the tumor periphery, as highlighted by the NOEMTR difference map. Overall, NOEMTR imaging, in combination with Gd-DOTA administration, demonstrates superior delineation of brain tumor boundaries compared to conventional MRI. As NOEMTR imaging is a fast acquisition scan (under 10 minutes) and performed on standard 3 Tesla, it can be easily integrated into clinical protocols. By improving visualization of tumor infiltration and distinguishing tumor regions from NABR, NOEMTR imaging holds promise for advancing neuro-oncological diagnostics and treatment planning.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

R.; Shatby, A.", "abstract": "Multiple studies have reported genes in the M. tuberculosis (Mtb) genome that are under diversifying selection, based on genetic variants among Mtb clinical isolates. These might reflect adaptions to selection pressures associated with modern clinical treatment of TB. Many, but not all, of these genes under selection are related to drug resistance. Most of these studies have evaluated selection at the gene-level. However, positive selection can be evaluated on different scales, including individual sites (codons) and local regions within an ORF. In this paper, we use GenomegaMap, a Bayesian method for calculating selection, to evaluate selection of genes in the Mtb genome at all three levels. We present evidence that the intermediate analysis (windows of codons) provides the most credible list of candidate genes under selection. A further advantage of this approach is that it identifies specific regions within proteins that are under selective pressure, which is useful for structural and functional interpretation. In an analysis of two separate collections of Mtb clinical isolates (from Moldova; and a globally-representative set), we observed 53 and 178 significant genes under selection, with 36% overlap. The lists of genes under selection include many drug-resistance genes, as well as other genes that have previously been reported to be under selection (resR, phoR). The specific regions under selection identified within drug-resistance genes are shown to correspond to protein structural features known to be involved in resistance, supporting accuracy of the method. Positive selection in several ESX-1-related genes was also observed, suggesting adaptation to immune pressure.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

To detect these changes, diagnostic imaging approaches rely primarily on single modalities to identify structural and functional changes, thus hindering patient stratification and treatment effectiveness. Recent studies suggest the brain undergoes anatomical and functional restructuring, resulting in neuro-metabolic and vascular dysregulation (MVD) prior amyloid-{beta}; accumulation. Several lines of evidence suggest that MVD begins at an early age and leads to the onset of AD. Therefore, we hypothesized that detecting MVD may serve as a sensitive and early noninvasive diagnostic tool, and was assessed in a retrospective clinical population from CN to AD. Methods A total of 403 subjects with 18F-FDG PET (FDG), and ASL MRI scanned within 180 days from ADNI 2 and 3 were included, where: CN/EMCI/MCI/LMCI/AD(95/71/112/42/83), M/F(55/45%). CBF images were generated from ASL images using ExploreASL. CBF and FDG images were used to evaluate cerebral perfusion and metabolism, respectively, and were registered to the MNI152+ atlas. Mean intensities across 59 brain regions were ratioed with whole brain mean values. z-scores were computed for disease subjects relative to a reference and projected onto a Cartesian space. Results were aligned with transcriptomic signatures and clinical cognitive assessments. Findings Our findings suggest that disease progression follows a stage-dependent MVD pattern that can identify at-risk brain regions. Although each region progresses at a different pace, regions related to memory, cognitive tasks, and motor function showed significant early dysregulation. Importantly, these changes aligned with transcriptomic and cognitive signatures. Interpretation We identified an MVD pattern that at-risk brain regions follow across the AD spectrum. In addition, our study shows that MVD in brain regions varies by sex and disease stage, making it a sensitive tool for early AD diagnosis.

To uncover determinants of therapeutic efficacy, we analyzed the infusion products of eight r/r DLBCL patients with distinct clinical responses to axicabtagene ciloleucel using single-cell transcriptomics. Compared to patients who exhibited progressive disease, infusion products of complete responders demonstrated enriched signatures of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Based on these findings, we developed a novel strategy to improve CD19-directed CAR T-cell treatment efficacy by incorporating IFN-I as an enhancer during the ex vivo manufacturing process. For both CD28- and 4-1BB-costimulated second-generation CARs, we found that low-strength IFN-I signaling enhanced CAR T-cell cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy. On the other hand, high-strength IFN-I signaling compromised cell viability and in vivo efficacy. Our low-strength IFN-I signaling approach leverages an existing FDA-approved pharmacologic agent and is compatible with current CAR constructs and manufacturing workflows. Together, our results establish IFN-I as a potent and costimulation- independent enhancer of CAR T-cell efficacy and provide a translationally feasible approach to enhance CAR T-cell therapies for r/r DLBCL.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

We show that AS evolves faster than GE, with both sources of variation being 'fine-tuned' over evolutionary time to become species-specific and clade-specific, respectively. Ecologically divergent species from younger radiations exhibit greater differences in splicing than those from older radiations. Most of these differentially spliced isoforms arose from standing variation, which was also present at low levels in non-radiating species, and increased in frequency during the adaptive radiation process. We identified several novel isoforms of craniofacial remodelling genes that emerged within each lake radiation and were differentially incorporated in the jaws of herbivorous vs. carnivorous species.

We hypothesized that lupus humoral \"environment\" could be responsible, at least in part, for these neutrophil abnormalities. We characterized the neutrophil phenotype in a cohort of lupus patients and assessed the impact of the \"lupus environment\". Methods: Blood samples were analyzed for neutrophil viability and expression of surface markers, by flow cytometry. Neutrophil-enriched suspensions were stimulated with serum samples from lupus patients, and apoptosis was monitored in real-time. Plasma samples were subjected to multiplex analysis. Whole blood and neutrophil-enriched suspensions were stimulated with lupus-relevant soluble factors or with heat-aggregated IgGs, which mimic the engagement of Fc gamma (Fc{gamma}) receptors by immune complexes, for viability and activation analysis. Results: Lupus neutrophils had reduced viability and increased apoptosis. They also displayed significant alterations in the expression of surface markers of adhesion, complement regulation, degranulation, and immune complex response. Stimulation of healthy neutrophils with lupus serum increased apoptosis. Lupus-relevant soluble factors accelerated neutrophil apoptosis. Heat-aggregated IgGs mirrored most of the key alterations in viability and surface marker expression observed in lupus neutrophils. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that Fc{gamma} receptors engagement is a major driver of the phenotype observed in lupus neutrophils, including increased apoptosis and dysregulated surface marker expression. These findings suggest that lupus neutrophils may not be inherently defective but rather educated by lupus-associated environmental cues.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Their formation is promoted by FGF signaling centers that form periodically in the wake of a shrinking Wnt active domain that inhibits epithelial rosette formation. However, the precise number and size of epithelial rosettes is influenced by the balance of mechanical interactions that promote or oppose formation of epithelial rosettes. When migration of leading cells is selectively compromised, slowing of the primordium is accompanied by the fusion of some epithelial rosettes to form fewer larger rosettes. Conversely, selective slowing of trailing cells results in splitting of previously formed rosettes to form smaller ones. These observations can be accounted for by mechanics-based models, where local interactions associated with apical constriction and cell adhesion promote clustering and formation of rosettes, while tension along the length of the primordium, influenced by the relative efficacy of leading and trailing cell migration, opposes such aggregation. We describe the development of Agent-based and Cellular Potts models that illustrate how the relative speed of leading versus trailing cells, as well as changes in cell adhesion and mechanical coupling, differentially regulated by Wnt and FGF signaling, can influence the pattern of neuromast formation and deposition by the migrating primordium.

Extant eukaryotes share several classes of highly-conserved lipid transfer proteins (LTP) that associate with donor membranes, bind individual lipid molecules, and shuttle them to acceptor membranes. Because cells lacking organelles do not require extensive lipid transport networks, it is not known if this machinery pre-dated eukaryotic organelles or had to evolve alongside them. Here we describe a class of putative lipid transporters in the Asgard archaeota superphylum that share a common ancestry with eukaryotic LTPs in the START domain superfamily. We identified three classes of Asgard START proteins, StarAsg1-3, which are conserved across most Asgard phylums. Of these, StarAsg1 family proteins contain the predicted structural features necessary for lipid transfer: large, hydrophobic binding pockets lined with amphipathic motifs for membrane docking. In contrast, StarAsg2 and StarAsg3 family proteins contain smaller binding cavities and minimal predicted membrane interactions. We found that StarAsg1 from Lokiarcheota interacts with anionic membranes both in vitro and in yeast cells, and can transfer sterols between liposomes. Phylogenetic analysis of START domains across the tree of life indicates that eukaryotic LTPs share a common ancestry with StarAsg1 homologs, while StarAsg2 and StarAsg3 form a monophyletic group with eukaryotic heat shock protein cochaperones. We propose that the emergence of proteins for inter-membrane lipid transporters in the ancestors of eukaryotic cells could have facilitated the subsequent development of intracellular organelles.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

We introduce BehaveAgent, an autonomous multimodal AI agent designed to automate behavior analysis from video input without retraining or manual intervention. Unlike conventional methods that require manual behavior annotation, video segmentation, task-specific model training, BehaveAgent leverages the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLM) to generalize across novel behavioral domains without need for additional training. It integrates LLMs, vision-language models (VLMs), and large-scale visual grounding modules, orchestrated through a multimodal context memory and goal-directed attention mechanism, to enable robust zero-shot visual reasoning across species and experimental paradigms, including plants, insects, rodents, primates, and humans. Upon receiving a video input, BehaveAgent autonomously identifies the correct analysis strategy and performs end-to-end behavior analysis and interpretation without human supervision. Leveraging vision-language representations, it performs general-purpose tracking, pose estimation and segmentation. We demonstrate BehaveAgent's universal applicability to autonomously (1) identify the behavioral paradigm and develop an action plan specialized for the identified paradigm, (2) identify relevant subjects and objects, (3) track those features, (4) identify behavioral sequences with explicit reasoning, (5) generate and execute code for targeted analysis and (6) generate comprehensive research reports that integrate behavioral findings with relevant scientific literature.

In this study, we investigated the effect of repeated subconcussive impact (RSCI) exposure on white matter (WM) microstructure in collegiate football players using advanced neuroimaging techniques. Twenty-two male athletes from the Queen's University Varsity Football Team were prospectively monitored over a single season. Participants were stratified into high-exposure (HE) and low-exposure (LE) groups based on impact frequency quantified with helmet-mounted accelerometers. MRI assessments, performed at pre-season, post-training camp, and post-season, included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) metrics, such as neurite density index (Vin), orientation dispersion index (ODI), and isotropic volume fraction (Viso). Between-group comparisons revealed that HE athletes exhibited significantly lower FA and higher MD in the corticospinal tracts at pre-season, along with increased Viso and reduced Vin and ODI in key association pathways compared to LE athletes. Longitudinal analyses demonstrated dynamic changes over the season, with significant alterations in diffusion metrics suggesting both acute injury responses and potential compensatory remodelling. These findings indicate that even in the absence of clinically diagnosed concussion, RSCIs are associated with quantifiable changes in WM integrity. Our results underscore the need for improved monitoring and intervention strategies in contact sports to mitigate the risk of cumulative neural injury and to safeguard long-term brain health in athletes.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Our understanding of how regulation of translation changes with disease has focused on mRNA and its translational regulatory factors, RNA binding proteins, and microRNAs, despite clear evidence for translational and post-translational dysfunction in ADRD and tauopathies. The neurobiology of tRNA has only recently begun to be studied, but the impact of chronic neurodegenerative diseases on tRNA biology and translational dysfunction is largely unknown. We have previously shown that the tRNA pool and tRNA modifications behave as a system to regulate the cellular stress response by undergoing stress-specific reprogramming and causing selective translation of mRNAs from codon-biased stress response genes. Here we tested this stress-induced tRNA reprogramming and codon-biased translation system in the response to mutant tau expression by performing mass spectrometric quantification of ~8500 proteins and 49 tRNA modifications, AQRNA-seq analysis of 222 cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs and other small RNAs, and informatic analysis of codon usage patterns in >23,000 protein-coding genes. Analysis of these datasets revealed that aging and tauopathy elicit major adaptation of the tRNA transcriptome and epitranscriptome as well as corresponding evidence of a program of translation of families of codon-biased genes for aging and disease responsive proteins. The mitochondrial tRNA transcriptome showed a strong response to aging and disease with 21 of the 22 mt-tRNAs showing age and disease-linked increases in expression, accompanied by mitochondria-specific modifications such as ms2i6A and f5C. Surprisingly, there were few significant changes in the 203 cytosolic tRNA isodecoders. However, a 10-fold increase tRNA isodecoder tRNA-Arg-TCT-5-1 was accompanied by increased translation of proteins encoded by genes highly enriched in its AGA cognate codon. These changes in tRNA biology are mirrored by strongly biased use of synonymous codons among the most highly upregulated and downregulated proteins in the P301S MAPT mice. Taken together these findings suggest the aging and disease brain produces an integrated response for translational control that is highly integrated with changes in tRNA biology.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

While disruptions in this inferential process have been proposed as core features of psychosis, whether such alterations can be observed in subclinical psychosis-like experiences (PLEs), and how they manifest across different forms of perceptual inference remains unclear. Methods: Two independent samples of healthy adults participated in the study: 80 completed a visual detection task, and 62 performed a motion discrimination task. Data were analysed using mixed-effects models with a continuous PLE measure and supplemented by categorical comparisons between the lowest- and highest-PLEs terciles. Results: PLEs predicted reduced sensitivity to sensory evidence and increased reliance on probabilistic cues across both tasks. Critically, history biases diverged across contexts. In the detection task, a repulsive bias from the previous stimulus was observed in the overall sample, but this effect was attenuated in high-PLEs. In contrast, in the discrimination task, high-PLEs exhibited a repulsive bias away from their previous choice, reversing the typical repetition tendency seen in low-PLEs. Conclusions: Our results suggest that psychosis-like traits alter how prior expectations interact with sensory input and recent perceptual history. High-PLEs showed reduced influence of recent sensory input in detection task, consistent with altered low-level adaptation. In contrast, in the discrimination task, they showed a shift away from previous choices, suggesting disruption of decision-level integration of past choices. This points to a task-dependent instability in the use of past information, reflecting a broader inferential vulnerability linked to the psychosis spectrum.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

The building of an asymmetric molecular model into density obtained by 11-fold symmetry averaging is inherently self-contradictory. This contradiction alone calls the validity of the derived structure into question. Our own data revealed that the complex primarily adopts an asymmetric open conformation in situ.

We assembled the genome from PacBio HiFi long reads (66X coverage), polished it with Illumina short reads (15X coverage), and annotated it using PacBio IsoSeq RNA data. We observed 15 chromosome-sized scaffolds varying in length from 13.2 Mbp to 37.6 Mbp (median 24.3 Mbp), combining a total genome size of 395.788 Mbp. This assembly is highly contiguous (contig N50 of 25.14 Mbp) and complete (BUSCO completeness score of 98.6% and 0.2% duplication rate).

The high sequencing depth also allowed us to assemble the genomes of the mitochondria and the common endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia. The mitochondrial genome was fully assembled (15,540 bp in size) with all expected genes annotated. The Wolbachia genome was fragmented, and we determined that it belongs to the B-supergroup.

We hypothesized that burn injury leads to epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming of innate immune cells. Splenic F4/80 macrophages were isolated from mice at days 2, 9, and 14 days post-20% contact burn injury. Targeted transcriptomics and MAPit single-molecule chromatin profiling were used to assess immune, metabolic, and epigenetic changes. Canonical pathway analysis was performed to infer functional shifts over time. Burn injury induced a biphasic response in macrophages. Early after injury (Day 2), there was broad transcriptional suppression and epigenetic silencing of inflammatory regulators, including Stat3, Traf6, and Nfkb1. Over time (Days 9 and 14), loci associated with anti-inflammatory mediators such as Il-10 and Socs3 exhibited progressive chromatin opening and transcriptional upregulation. Metabolic gene profiles revealed persistent suppression of mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation programs. Canonical pathway analysis demonstrated early IL-10 signaling activation with sustained suppression of classical macrophage activation pathways. Chromatin architecture changes included nucleosome sliding and ejection events, consistent with dynamic, locus-specific regulation. This work challenges the classical notion of burn-induced immune suppression as purely a consequence of systemic inflammation.

Animal models have advanced our understanding of SLE's molecular basis, but the FDA's recent elimination of animal testing requirements for drug approval has raised concerns about their validity, prompting a reevaluation of their role in basic research, especially for heterogeneous diseases like SLE. Methods Four different spontaneous SLE mouse models were studied: MRLlpr/lpr, NZB/W, BXSB.Yaa, and Tlr7.Tg6. Transcriptome sequencing from blood, spleen, and kidney, flow cytometry from the spleen, and cytokines and autoantibody measurement in plasma were performed at four time points. Similar molecular data from human SLE patients was used for the integration. Results The study identified specific molecular pathways driving the phenotype in each mouse model and established optimal time points for future experimental designs. By comparing these pathways to human SLE, the most similar ones and their relationship with disease activity were identified, providing crucial insight into translational relevance. Importantly, disease severity across models was linked to the extent and timing of molecular dysregulations. As expected, MRLlpr/lpr showed the most aggressive phenotype with early immune activation and apoptosis dysregulation, while Tlr7.Tg6 presented late-onset signatures associated with interferon and inflammation. Shared molecular features with human SLE included interferon responses, T and B cell depletion, and neutrophil activation. Integration analysis revealed distinct yet overlapping immune pathways between models and species, with some signatures such as age-associated B cells and double-negative memory T cells being model-specific but potentially relevant to early disease processes. Conclusions These findings build a valuable framework for future SLE research, reinforcing the utility of mouse models in studying specific molecular pathways related to human SLE pathogenesis and heterogeneity. The integration of longitudinal mouse data with human transcriptomes highlights the models that best recapitulate key aspects of human disease, offering guidance for the study of specific immunopathological mechanisms or therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrate deep learning-based analysis of 1,112 histological images with RNA-seq data from 659 samples across seven reproductive organs in 304 female donors aged 20-70 years. We show that female reproductive organs and tissues have asynchronous aging dynamics: while the ovary and vagina age gradually, the uterus undergoes an abrupt transcriptional and cellular transition around the age of menopause. Tissue segmentation highlights that the myometrium in the uterine wall is the most age-affected tissue, marked by extracellular matrix remodeling and immune activation. Across reproductive organs, the epithelial tissue is also strongly affected by age, with the vaginal epithelium showing a unique sharp menopausal transition. Integration via multi-omics factor analysis links these tissue-specific histological transformations to specific molecular shifts, many with nonlinear expression trajectories and enriched in heritable reproductive traits such as pelvic organ prolapse and age at menarche.

However, the role of the tumour microenvironment in modulating sensitivity to nutrient restriction (NR) remains poorly understood. Using a Drosophila brain dedifferentiation neural stem cell (NSC) tumour model induced by Prospero (Pros) inhibition, we show that tumour sensitivity to NR is governed by the perineural glial (PG) cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a major component of the glial niche surrounding the tumour. We identify the SLC36 amino acid transporter Pathetic (Path) as a crucial regulator of nutrient sensitivity. Under NR, while wildtype buffers against low nutrient levels by upregulating Path, tumour glia downregulate Path. Furthermore, Path is specifically required by the tumour (but not wildtype) PG; its downregulation causes reduced proliferation of PG cells and, in turn, restricts NSC tumour growth. Path influences PG proliferation via the mTor-S6K pathway, and its expression is controlled by Ilp6 levels and the Insulin/PI3K pathway. Overexpression of Path is sufficient to counteract the inhibitory effects of NR on tumour growth. These findings suggest that Path levels at the BBB play a key role in determining tumour sensitivity to NR.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

In 136 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma whole blood samples, 6,956 protein groups were found, including 678 not seen in healthy samples, expanding the total to 12,357 blood proteins. This represents the most comprehensive blood proteome to date.

By investigating the T cell receptor repertoire of individuals with IBD, novel therapeutic and preventive strategies can be identified, and a better understanding of IBD can be obtained. Methods Whereas most studies have so far focused on the more diverse T cell receptor beta (TRB) repertoire, we here profiled the alpha (TRA) repertoire of three cohorts containing treatment-naive and treated individuals in addition to individuals living with the disease for >20 years, resulting in an exhaustive dataset containing the TRA repertoire of 2,151 individuals. Results Using the generated datasets, we were able to replicate previous findings describing the expansion of Crohn's-associated invariant T (CAIT) cells in individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) in the three cohorts. Using a hypothesis-free statistical testing framework, we identified clonotypes that were associated with the disease at its different stages, e.g., at the time of diagnosis and decades post-diagnosis. By conducting a meta-analysis across the three cohorts, we were able to identify a set of clonotypes that were associated with the disease regardless of its stage. We validated our findings in a previously published independent test dataset from a German cohort, showing the robustness of the identified sets of clonotypes. Conclusion The identified clonotypes are potential novel therapeutic targets to treat IBD, e.g., through targeted depletion. These clonotypes are also of major interest as they can be investigated in a targeted fashion to identify culprit antigen(s) in IBD.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "The impact of an invasive species is strongly influenced by the extent of its invaded range. Predicting the potential distribution of an invader is thus critical for informing decisions around surveillance, containment, and eradication. Such predictions ideally would come from a mechanistic species distribution model. These models directly describe how aspects of the environment affect organismal fitness, and may also provide insight into population dynamics, such as rates of population growth and spread. Here, we develop a temperature-dependent stage-structured population dynamic model for a globally significant invader, the polyphagous shot-hole borer (PSHB, Euwallacea fornicatus). We use this model to predict the beetle's potential growth rate across its invaded range. Invasive PSHB causes serious damage to urban and agricultural trees, and so the continued expansion of its global distribution is a major concern. We synthesise previous studies to parameterise the model, yielding estimates of population growth as a function of daily temperatures within a host tree. We ran the model over one year using daily climate data across regions with invasive PSHB populations: South Africa, California, Israel and Australia. Our potential distribution maps indicate that PSHB currently occupies the most climatically suitable parts of California and Israel, but is yet to invade the most suitable regions in Australia and South Africa. The model shows the species is capable of very high population growth: in already-invaded locations, the average daily growth rate had an upper bound of ~ 0.05 (equivalent to population doubling in 14 days). Growth predictions were sensitive to the parameter for adult female mortality during between-host dispersal. This is an uncertain parameter (there is very little data available), but we estimated that for current populations to persist, the loss through dispersal mortality needs to be < 40%. We use our model to predict the maximum spread rate of PSHB (discounting transport by humans) to be 3 km/year. Our model provides insights into the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of invasion risk, which will assist global efforts to manage the ongoing invasion of this species.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

E.; Clerk, A.", "abstract": "Background. The anti-cancer MEK inhibitor trametinib (alone or with the RAF inhibitor dabrafenib) causes cardiac dysfunction or heart failure in some patients. Our hypothesis is that cardiotoxicity is exacerbated by an underlying co-morbidity such as hypertension causing early cardiac dysfunction detectable on echocardiograms. Objectives. The objectives were to assess the effects of trametinib on cardiac function in a mouse model of hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy and determine if this was moderated by dabrafenib. Methods. Male mice were treated with vehicle, trametinib or dabrafenib/trametinib in the absence/presence of angiotensin II (AngII; 0.8 mg/kg/d to increase blood pressure over 7 d). Hearts were imaged using echocardiography. Results. Inhibitors alone had a limited effect on mouse hearts over 28 d. Trametinib or trametinib/dabrafenib inhibited cardiac hypertrophy induced by AngII over 7 d, reducing left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and mass. AngII did not significantly affect cardiac function, but the inhibitors caused significant functional deterioration. Segmental analysis revealed variation of contraction around the LV, with selective effects of AngII and trametinib or dabrafenib/trametinib in basal/mid-regional segments. Frame-by-frame analysis of radial (not longitudinal) displacement of the LV endocardial wall demonstrated variation between consecutive cardiac cycles that enabled a high degree of classification according to treatment. Conclusions. Trametinib inhibits AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice but is detrimental to cardiac function, responses that are not moderated by dabrafenib. AngII and MEK/RAF inhibition have regional effects around the LV with greater effects on radial displacement in basal/mid-regional segments. Assessment of such changes may facilitate early identification of developing cardiotoxicity.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

However, existing methods often overlook individual differences in whole-cortex network organization and were not explicitly designed to identify TMS targets near the scalp. Objective: We develop a novel framework to simultaneously optimize FC and scalp proximity for personalized target localization. Methods: We use the multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) to estimate high-quality individual-specific networks. A tree-based algorithm is then used to select the optimal target location. By essentially having no parameter to tune, our framework might improve generalizability across populations. We compare our approach to existing FC-based algorithms for TMS target selection in terms of scalp proximity, test-retest reliability, and FC to brain regions implicated in depression. Results: In two test-retest datasets of healthy individuals from the United States and Singapore, tree-based MS-HBM reliably identifies personalized TMS targets for depression in close proximity to the scalp. These targets are equivalent or superior to targets identified using prior algorithms in terms of reliability, scalp proximity, and FC to the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. To demonstrate versatility, we apply the same algorithm, without having to tune any parameter, to identify personalized TMS targets for anxiety.

Successful closure requires elongation and apical constriction of neuroepithelial cells. These critical behaviours have not been studied in human, patient-specific models. We characterise a human iPSC-derived neuroepithelial morphogenesis model which is highly reproducible between lines. Differentiated neuroepithelial cells actively undergo ROCK-dependent apical constriction. ROCK acts downstream of planar cell polarity/VANGL2 in other species. We find that VANGL2 is up-regulated and phosphorylated during iPSCs-to-neuroepithelial differentiation. The patient-identified VANGL2-R353C mutation does not alter its expression, localisation or phosphorylation, but reduces myosin-II phosphorylation and apical constriction relative to congenic control iPSCs. Non-congenic comparisons and forward genetic testing are also informative in this reproducible model. We compare lines reprogrammed from amniocytes of two patients with spina bifida, versus two controls. One patient-derived line forms a morphologically normal neuroepithelium, but fails to differentiate into neurons. The second fails to undergo apicobasal elongation, and harbours compound heterozygous mutations in the MED24 gene previously implicated in neuroepithelial elongation in mice. Thus, iPSC-derived neuroepithelial modelling provides mechanistic insights into conserved cell behaviours, links genetically-impaired apical constriction with a human disease, and establishes patient-specific models which recapitulate failures of heterogenous neuroepithelial functions.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Regulation of cell death is mostly orchestrated by the activation of Caspases, proteases which were long thought to trigger an irreversible engagement in cell death. However, recent data in vivo and in vitro outline numerous non-apoptotic functions of caspases as well as quite ubiquitous sublethal activation of effector caspases during development. Yet, it remains unclear in many instances what drives the bifurcation between cell death engagement and cell survival upon caspase activation. The existence of a caspase activity threshold was generally considered to underpin this binary decision, but this was never assessed quantitatively in vivo especially at the single cell level. Using quantitative live imaging combined with machine learning and optogenetics in the Drosophila pupal notum (a single layer epithelium), we reveal for the first time the existence of a large heterogeneity of caspase sensitivity between cells, as well as the existence of distinct spatial domains with low or high sensitivity to caspases. Using correlative and perturbative experiments, we outline the central role of past exposure to sublethal caspase activity which sensitises cells for apoptosis for several hours. Integrating information about past caspase activation is sufficient to explain most of the global pattern of caspase sensitivity and predict at the single cell level which cells will engage in apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that past sublethal caspase activation in a subset of cells is sufficient to bias cell elimination at the clonal and single cell level, thus revealing an alternative mechanism of physiological cell competition. Altogether, this work reveals for the first time the existence of a new layer of apoptosis regulation in vivo downstream of effector caspases which can be developmentally regulated and bias clonal selection and the spatial pattern of cell death.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Salusso and D. Raimunda, Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology 7:84, 2017, https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00084). Here we provide evidence that a protein encoded in yiiP's operon, PA3962, is fundamental to the coupling of this process. Immunodetection assay indicates that PA3962 locates in membranes. Supporting a role in oprD regulation, an insertion mutant has increased imipenem sensitivity, which is suppressed by gene complementation but not in presence of Zn2+, as opposed to the YiiP mutant. We identified 2 pairs of conserved acidic residues in a hydrophobic juxtamembrane domain. Metal binding specificity and stoichiometry was explored in wild type and mutant versions of these. Zn2+ is the cognate metal being D40, D47 and D65 required for Zn2+ coordination. As the periplasmic Zn2+-sensor CzcS regulates oprD expression, the interaction with it was analyzed in vitro.

Combining neuroimaging and computational modeling, this study examined how future interaction prospects-a key element of social bonds-modulate reactive and proactive punishment. Participants acted as second- or third-party punishers, responding to allocation offers from individuals with or without future interactions. Results showed that participants imposed harsher punishment on both fair and unfair offers from individuals they did not expect to interact with, aligning with lower self-reported social closeness. Heightened provocation sensitivity, reflected in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex activity, drove the increased reactive punishment toward wrongdoers without future interactions, whereas punishment of future-interacting transgressors was associated with enhanced dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, dmPFC) activity. A stronger preference for relative advantage and reduced harm sensitivity, linked to dlPFC and temporoparietal junction activity, mediated greater proactive punishment towards non-future-interacting individuals. Moreover, proactive punishment and underlying neurocognitive processes followed a collective retaliation pattern, increasing after unfair (vs. fair) behavior from another non-future-interacting individual.

Despite their ecological and biotechnological importance, many regulatory proteins are still uncharacterised, and their signalling networks are poorly studied in comparison to other bacterial phyla. Two small proteins, PipX, unique to cyanobacteria, and PII, widespread in bacteria and plants, are the hubs of a protein interaction network involved in carbon/nitrogen homeostasis, energy sensing, translational regulation and growth. Here we exploit the NanoBiT complementation system to demonstrate in real time that temperature affects PipX interactions with its best studied partners: the signal transduction protein PII, the global transcriptional regulator NtcA, and the ribosome-assembly GTPase EngA. While heat shock increased PipX-PII complex formation and impaired PipX-EngA and PipX-NtcA interactions, cold shock resulted in a decrease of all three complexes. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra of isolated PipX suggested the involvement of its C-terminal -helix in the common response to cold shock. However, during longer term acclimatization, each type of complex responded distinctively after up- or downshifts in temperature and PipX-PII and PipX-NtcA interactions were influenced in opposite ways. Altogether the results indicate that PipX is a thermometer of low temperatures, bringing new light to the study of environmental signaling in cyanobacteria.

Our analyses reveal that head shape variation is only weakly structured by phylogeny and allometry, but shaped by ecological specialization. Morphospace patterns reflect distinct differences in species with different ecologies: fossorial species exhibit compact, broadened heads suited for burrowing; aquatic species show streamlined profiles for hydrodynamic efficiency; and arboreal snakes tend to possess elongated skulls for maneuvering in complex habitats. Terrestrial and semi-fossorial snakes display broad morphospace overlap and an elevated shape disparity highlighting morphological versatility.

Tissue development has conventionally been studied with ex vivo systems where mechanical properties of the extracellular environment are either poorly controlled in space and time, lack tunability, or do not mimic ECM mechanics. For these reasons, it remains unknown how matrix stress relaxation rate, a time-dependent mechanical property that influences several cellular processes, regulates mammary branching morphogenesis. Here, we systematically investigated the influence of matrix stress relaxation on mammary branching morphogenesis using 3D alginate-collagen matrices and spheroids of human mammary epithelial cells. Slow stress relaxing matrices promoted significantly greater branch formation compared to fast stress relaxing matrices. Branching in slow stress relaxing matrices was accompanied by local collagen fiber alignment, while collagen fibers remained randomly oriented in fast stress relaxing matrices. In slow stress relaxing matrices, branch formation was driven by intermittent pulling contractions applied to the local ECM at the tips of elongating branches, which was accompanied by an abundance of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (phospho-FAK) and {beta}1 integrin at the tips of branches. On the contrary, we observed that growing spheroids in fast stress relaxing matrices applied isotropic pushing forces to the ECM. Pharmacological inhibition of both Rac1 and non-muscle myosin II prevented epithelial branch formation, regardless of matrix stress relaxation rate. Interestingly, restricting cellular expansion via increased osmotic pressure was sufficient to impede epithelial branching in slow stress relaxing matrices.

This is in part due to a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment which has developed bio-orthogonal mechanisms of immune escape. To address this challenge, the field has turned to combination immunotherapies, but systemic administration of potent combination therapies has resulted in severe immune related adverse effects and toxicity. Enabling potent combination immunotherapies requires administering these immune agonists in a way that more closely resembles the endogenous cancer immunity cycle, a tightly regulated sequence of cues in both space and time. Here, we explore the ability of an injectable hydrogel depot to enable the rational localization of potent immunotherapeutic cytokines (IL-12, IL-2) and antibodies (OX40a). We hypothesized that selectively altering the biodistribution of these cargo would enable tolerable and synergic anticancer combinations, so we leveraged a previously characterized injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel system to deliver these agonists either intratumorally (IT) or peritumorally (PT). Using in vivo imaging, we demonstrated that site of administration is critical to redistributing cargo to either the tumor or tumor draining lymph node (tdLN).

M.; van der Donk, W.", "abstract": "Glycocins are a growing family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides that are O- and/or S-glycosylated. Using a sequence similarity network of putative glycosyltransferases, the tht biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in the genome of Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum. ThtA is the precursor peptide to a member of the glycocin F family of glycocins. Like other members of this family, the glycosyltransferase (ThtS) encoded in the biosynthetic gene cluster adds N-acetyl-glucosamine to both Ser and Cys residues of ThtA. S-linked glycosylation has been shown to be chemically and enzymatically resistant to cleavage and therefore ThtS may be a valuable starting point for engineering efforts. The glycocin derived from ThtA, which we name thermoglycocin, was structurally characterized. Thermoglycocin is unique in that in addition to two nested disulfide bonds, it contains an additional disulfide bond creating a C-terminal loop. Unexpectedly, ThtA lacks the common double glycine motif that denotes a C39-peptidase leader peptide cleavage site. Based on AlphaFold3 modeling, we postulate that cleavage between the leader and core peptide occurs instead at a GK motif. This study adds to the small number of characterized glycocins, employs AlphaFold3 to aid in predicting the structure of the mature peptide product, and suggests a common naming convention similar to that established for lanthipeptides.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

R.; Marjanska, M.; Schallmo, M.-P.", "abstract": "Excitatory and inhibitory neural processes are essential for every aspect of brain function, but the current, non-invasive, neuroimaging methods to study these in the human brain are limited. Recent studies which separate oscillatory and aperiodic components of electrophysiological power spectra have highlighted a relationship between aperiodic activity and functional brain states. Studies in both animal models and humans suggest that the aperiodic slope of electrophysiological power spectra reflects the local balance of excitatory:inhibitory (E:I) synaptic transmission. Aperiodic slope varies across individuals, brain states, and clinical populations, which may reflect important differences in E:I balance. However, there is currently a lack of evidence linking aperiodic slope to other measures of excitation and inhibition in the human brain. Here, we show that flatter (less steep) aperiodic slopes from human electroencephalography (EEG) are associated with higher concentrations of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate measured with 7 tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the occipital lobe at rest. This suggests that individual differences in aperiodic neural activity reflect cortical glutamate concentrations, providing important insight for understanding changes in neural excitation across brain states and neuropsychiatric populations (e.g., schizophrenia) where glutamatergic function may differ. Our results support the use of aperiodic slope as a non-invasive marker for excitatory tone in the human brain.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Yet, emerging evidence suggests that distinct neural mechanisms underlie these processes. In motion perception, studies have identified a neural network involving visual and associative parietal areas supporting these abilities. Whilst early (V1/V2) and specialized (V5/MT+) visual areas are associated with motion discrimination accuracy, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS/LIP) plays a critical role in the formation of subjective confidence for sensory decision, given its functionally coupling with the V5/MT+_V1/V2 network. Previous studies have consistently reported that increasing connectivity in the human V5/MT+ to V1/V2 pathway by means of cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS), a neurostimulation protocol inducing Hebbian-like changes in neuronal pathways, improves our perceptual ability to discriminate motion. Notably, we recently demonstrated that strengthening V5/MT+ influence over V1/V2 also leads to overconfidence, altering metacognitive bias for motion discrimination, suggesting that the manipulation of V5/MT+_V1/V2 network might functionally affect IPS/LIP activity. Here, we directly investigated this possibility by first strengthening the V5/MT+_V1 pathway with ccPAS, and subsequently interfering with IPS/LIP activity by means of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS). In line with previous evidence, our results corroborate that enhancing V5/MT+_V1/V2 connectivity affects both motion discrimination and metacognitive bias. Crucially, IPS/LIP disruption through cTBS selectively affects metacognitive performance while leaving motion discrimination unaltered. These findings highlight distinct neural substrates for perceptual sensitivity and visual metacognition linked to V5/MT+ and IPS/LIP, respectively, opening to potential tailored applications of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to functionally improve sensory and metacognitive decision-making processes", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

However, previous studies have shown that diffusion-weighted fMRI (dfMRI), from which ADC-fMRI derives, is influenced by BOLD effects, leading to a concern that the dfMRI contrast is still rooted in neurovascular rather than neuromorphological coupling. Mitigation strategies have been proposed to remove vascular contributions while retaining neuromorphological coupling, by: i) analysing ADC timecourses calculated from two interleaved diffusion-weightings, known as ADC-fMRI; ii) using b-values of at least 200 s mm-2 ; and iii) using a sequence compensated for cross-terms with fluctuating background field gradients associated with blood oxygenation. Respiration-induced haemodynamic fluctuations, which are dissociated from neural activity, are an excellent test-bed for the robustness of ADC-fMRI to vascular contributions. In this study, we investigate the association between end-tidal CO2 and ADC-fMRI, in comparison with dfMRI and BOLD, in both breath-hold and resting-state paradigms in the human brain. We confirm a strong dependence of the BOLD signal on respiration, and find a pattern of delayed haemodynamic response to respiration in regions comprising the default mode network. While dfMRI mitigates much of the vascular contribution, it retains some association with respiration, as expected. Conversely, ADC-fMRI is mostly unaffected by vascular contribution, exhibiting minimal correlation between expired CO2 and ADC timeseries, as well as low inter- and intra-subject reproducibility in correlation maps. These findings validate ADC-fMRI as a predominantly non-vascular contrast sensitive to microstructural dynamics, enabling whole-brain functional imaging unconstrained by vascular confounds.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Neuroticism could not be predicted from brain activity, with Bayesian evidence against all theory-guided neural measures. However, preregistered whole-brain models successfully decoded vulnerability to stress, a lower-level facet of neuroticism, with results replicating in a hold-out sample.

Machine learning algorithms segregated subjects into seven different sub-phenotypes of pneumonia with distinct histopathology signatures. Quantitative immunofluorescence demonstrated associations of macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, and B cells with select histology features and pulmonary pathology sub-phenotypes.

We implemented an approach involving inoculation with metabolic probes during microbiota fermentations and measured their degradation. In most exposure groups, we observed no alteration of microbiota biotransformation capacity, however, we detected significant alterations in biotransformation rates after exposure to meropenem, doripenem and tobramycin. Interestingly, common patterns of biotransformation capacity were observed in the gut microbiomes from rats exposed to carbapenems and partially shared in microbiomes exposed to tobramycin. These results aligned well with prior metagenomic and metabolomic findings.

In soils, this trade off is particularly relevant in the rhizosphere and detritusphere, where microorganisms encounter distinct resource inputs from living and decaying roots. Using H218O quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP), we measured in situ bacterial and fungal growth rates in the rhizosphere, the root detritusphere, and in the combined presence of rhizosphere + root detritus to test whether specialists (microbes growing in a single habitat) grow faster than generalists that persist across multiple environments. Specialists grew consistently faster than generalists, suggesting a trade off between the breadth of environmental conditions a microorganism can tolerate and its ability to grow quickly in a specific habitat. This cost to broad niche adaptation was apparent for bacteria, but growth rates of fungal saprotrophs varied little between specialists and generalists, reflecting how fundamental differences in life history strategies between bacteria and fungi can shape microbial responses to resource availability and habitat heterogeneity. Net relatedness and nearest taxon indices indicated total bacterial communities were phylogenetically clustered while specialist and generalist communities were phylogenetically random, suggesting that functional traits, not lineage, best predict ecological strategy. In annual grassland soils, fast growing specialists may dominate ecosystem processes when resources abound, and slow growing generalists may sustain element transformations when conditions shift; understanding this interplay is key to predicting soil-carbon trajectories.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

We used a large-scale comparative genomics framework to construct a comprehensive catalog of today s N2 fixation-associated genes and assessed their distribution across diverse microbial genomes and environmental backgrounds. Genomes enriched in N2 fixation genes generally have larger genome sizes, broader metabolic capabilities, wider habitat ranges, and are predominantly associated with mesophilic and aerobic lifestyles.

This study examined the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in salivary tissues and basal cell-derived human salivary progenitor cells (hS/PCs), an unstudied potential entry point for SARS-CoV-2. Multiple detection modalities, including immunocytochemistry, western blotting, flow cytometry and RT-PCR, demonstrated a consistent lack of ACE2 protein and transcript in both tissue specimens and primary salivary epithelial cells. Antigen retrieval at pH 9 was determined to be optimal for immunodetection protocols, yet ACE2 remained undetectable. Small intestine tissue served as a positive control, confirming the validity of the methods and reagents we used. Considering there can be other receptors for SARS-CoV-2, flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein failed to bind to salivary epithelial cells, in contrast to HEK293 cells engineered to overexpress ACE2, which showed robust spike binding. These findings strongly support our conclusion that salivary cells do not serve as major targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection via ACE2 or spike protein, whether through direct exposure to viral particles in ductal fluids or via access to basal cells across the basement membrane.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Because life history traits are directly linked to fitness, life history theory can serve as a useful framework for evaluating how populations within species may respond to rapid environmental change. However, relatively few studies quantify multiple life history traits and their tradeoffs across many populations, especially in marine taxa. Here, we used a 10-month laboratory experiment to quantify a suite of reproductive traits in populations spanning the strongest latitudinal temperature gradient in the worlds coastal oceans. We examined reproductive traits in wild-captured adults exposed to simulated local conditions for 7 native Atlantic and 4 introduced Pacific populations of the marine predatory gastropod Urosalpinx cinerea. Our data reveals that reproductive season length, the number of reproductive attempts, and annual fecundity unimodally peaked at mid-latitude populations, the species range-center. Introduced populations had comparably few spawning attempts and low fecundity despite a longer reproductive period in a less seasonal environment. We then conducted a second experiment quantifying thermal tolerance of developing embryos from 3 native populations, which revealed high sensitivity to temperature at early life stages but weak population differentiation. Taken together, our data reveal stark differences in reproduction that appear to reflect fast and slow paced lifestyles, which may maximize fitness by spreading the risk of reproductive failure over a single season or lifetime. Our results indicate that warm range-edge populations are highly vulnerable to warming, as low embryonic thermal tolerance may shorten the spawning season and warming is likely to reduce fecundity.

We analyzed frame-by-frame video recordings to examine the influence of this morphology on picking 14 fruit species. The spider monkeys most frequent reach strategy was a branch withdraw in which they reached equally with either hand for a branch, hooked their fingers around it, and pulled it toward themselves to take the attached fruit by mouth. Less frequently they picked fruit by hand or only by mouth. Hand and arm extension, with rotatory movements at the wrist, elbow, and shoulder, assisted reaching and transferring food to the mouth, and tail prehension further assisted extending reaches horizontally and ventrally into the tree canopy. To pick fruit by hand, they used tactile guidance and finger pad to palm grasps, mainly with the second digit, and rotatory arm and head movements to deliver fruit from the hand to the mouth. Fruit was grasped by the incisors and chewed with molars to release the endocarp for swallowing, with the exocarp sometimes ejected by spitting. The combination of branch-withdrawal, mouth grasping and postural extension via a prehensile tail constitutes a reach phenotype that contrasts with the grasp phenotype of the sympatric capuchin monkey.

Aerobic organisms degrade uric acid via a well-known \"oxidative pathway\" involving dearomatization of the purine core catalyzed by uric acid oxidases or dehydrogenases. The ability to degrade uric acid is also widespread in anaerobic bacteria, including gut bacteria, although the mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of a recently identified uric acid degradation gene cluster from Escherichia coli, and show that it encodes a \"reductive pathway\" for uric acid degradation. In this pathway, uric acid is first reduced to isoxanthine (2,8-dioxopurine) by a xanthine dehydrogenase homolog (XdhD), followed by dearomatization of the purine core catalyzed by a flavin-dependent reductase (YgfK). Stepwise cleavage of the pyrimidine and imidazole rings forms 2,3-diureidopropionate, and stepwise cleavage of the 2- and 3-ureido groups then forms 2,3-diaminopropionate, which is cleaved by a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent lyase (YgeX) to pyruvate and ammonia. Detection of isoxanthine in clinical serum samples suggests it is a physiologically relevant circulating metabolite.

We propose an individual-based model that captures these MOI-dependent dynamics phenomenologically. The model assumes a fixed average delay in lysis timing per superinfection, with stochastic variability, and successfully reproduces the experimentally observed multiple peaks in phage production following controlled phage addition. We extend the model to simulate batch culture growth and demonstrate that synchronized collapse of LINed culture can emerge as a collective phenomenon when LOR cells have a higher, but finite, LO threshold.

Data were collected from 14 studies, with 39 treatment mean differences for CH4 production, comprising both beef and dairy cattle fed CHBr3-containing ingredients, while accounting for dose, DMI, and diet composition. The random-effects model's estimates revealed that at an average CHBr3 dose of {approx}28.3 mg/kg DM, CH4 production was reduced by 47.3%, CH4 yield by 43.3%, and CH4 intensity by 39.0%, with increases in CHBr3 dose resulting in larger efficacy in mitigating CH4 emissions. The efficacy of CHBr3 was influenced by cattle type, with greater mitigation effects in beef cattle than dairy catle, and by dietary composition, with greater reductions observed in diets higher in starch, whereas higher NDF levels attenuate its effect. At the average CHBr3 dose, estimated DMI was significantly reduced by 6.45% and 3.26% in dairy and beef cattle, respectively. The significant reduction in DMI did translate into a significant effect on milk yield (-4.60%) at average CHBr3 dose. Carrier type (oil vs. biomass), measurement technique and cattle type influenced the results. Oil carrier potentially leading to more pronounced reductions, particularly for CH4 intensity, respiration chambers yielded significantly greater CH4 reductions compared to other methods, and beef cattle showed stronger mitigation effects than dairy cattle.

This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in biological systems. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions, and takes a step forward towards a more biologically plausible mechanism for continuous learning.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

This process has been interpreted as a form of active sensing and is associated with faster responses and improved perceptual accuracy. While converging evidence suggests that respiration also shapes interoceptive processing at both neural and behavioural levels, it remains unclear whether individuals actively adjust their breathing to optimize interoceptive performance. In this study, we examined whether healthy participants modulated their respiration during an interoceptive (heartbeat discrimination) and an exteroceptive (tactile detection) task. We analysed respiration both in terms of time-locked activity and inter-trial phase coherence relative to stimulus onset and assessed their relationship with perceptual accuracy. Our results demonstrated that participants systematically adjust their breathing in both amplitude and phase, synchronizing respiration to the anticipated (i.e., cued) onset of stimuli in both tasks. Crucially, task performance was enhanced during exhalation compared to inhalation, suggesting that respiratory modulation supports the perception of both interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

M.; Guimera-Brunet, A.; Wykes, R.", "abstract": "Cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs) are large scale disruptions of neuronal homeostasis that contribute to secondary injury in ischaemic stroke. In healthy cortex, CSDs induce vasodilation to meet metabolic demand, whereas in ischaemic tissue, they can provoke vasoconstriction and sustained hypoperfusion, exacerbating damage. We present a multimodal neurotechnology platform integrating flexible, transparent graphene solution-gated field-effect transistor (gSGFET) arrays with laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), enabling simultaneous DC coupled electrophysiological recordings and cerebral blood flow imaging with high spatiotemporal fidelity. gSGFETs enable stable, distortion-free recording of infraslow potentials essential for resolving CSD waveforms in vivo. In two murine stroke models, we show that CSD waveform duration and morphology scale with local perfusion, delineating electrophysiological subtypes predictive of tissue viability and haemodynamic response. In metabolically compromised cortex, CSDs exhibit double peaks or negative ultraslow components that result in vasoconstriction, contrasting with narrow, monophasic waveforms eliciting vasodilation in healthy regions. Systemic ketamine shortens CSD duration and converts vasoconstriction to vasodilation in perfusion deficit tissue, revealing a mechanism for its neuroprotective action.

Its degradation in nature is mediated by specialized bacteria, many of which rely on the enzyme sulfoquinovosidase (YihQ) to release SQ from SQDG. Despite its ecological importance, the diversity and functional roles of SQ-degrading microorganisms remain poorly characterized in natural environments. Here, we developed a yihQ-targeted amplicon sequencing approach to investigate the richness and distribution of SQ-degrading bacteria across selected environments, including marine sediments and the mammalian gut. We revealed particularly high richness of yihQ-containing microorganisms in cow rumen, far exceeding that observed in human and mouse gut microbiomes, suggesting an important role of SQ metabolism in ruminant digestion. Anaerobic microcosm experiments with SQ-amended rumen fluid revealed cooperative microbial degradation of SQ to sulfide via isethionate cross-feeding. Amplicon sequencing and genome-resolved metagenomics identified novel uncultured SQ-degrading taxa, including members of Caproiciproducens (Acutalibacteraceae), Limivicinus (Oscillospiraceae), and Sphaerochaetaceae, which encode the sulfo-transketolase pathway, along with Mailhella (Desulfovibrionaceae), a likely isethionate-respiring bacterium. This study presents the first functional gene-based assay for tracking environmental yihQ diversity, highlights SQ degradation as a central metabolic process in the cow rumen, describes novel SQ-metabolizing bacteria, and advances understanding of sulfur physiology in complex microbial communities.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Aided by recent advances in molecular biology techniques, the list of known PyVs is rapidly growing, revealing unexpected broad sequence, and host heterogenicity. Given their dependence on nuclear localization, large tumor antigens represent an attractive model for studying the nuclear transport process. A comprehensive analysis of the evolution of classical nuclear localization signals (cNLSs) within LTAs encoded by PyVs infecting mammals highlighted strong positional conservation of cNLSs between the LXCXE motif and the origin-binding domain (OBD). Here we extend such analysis to PyVs infecting non-mammalian hosts. We combined biochemical, structural and functional assays to demonstrate that Black Sea Bass (BSB) PyV-LTA is transported into the nucleus by the Importin (IMP)/{beta}1 heterodimer thanks to the recognition of a bipartite cNLS located downstream of the SF3 helicase domain, rather than between the LXCXE motif and the OBD. Such cNLS binds with high affinity to several IMPisoforms by simultaneously interacting with the minor and major binding sites. Substitution of NLS key basic residues abrogating binding to IMP, or co-expression with the well characterized IMP/{beta}1 inhibitor Bimax2 suppressed nuclear localization. Intriguingly a cNLS could be identified in a similar position in LTAs from other PyVs infecting ray-finned fishes, but not cartilaginous fishes, birds or scorpions, where cNLSs were predicted elsewhere. Our study suggests that LTAs from PyVs infecting different non-mammalian hosts might bear cNLS in distinctive positions, possibly reflecting processes of virus-host adaptation.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Although extracellular Cl- is also essential for transport, whether Cl- ions are transported has been disputed, raising the question why Cl- ions are required? Here, we examine the role of Cl- using transport measurements, conformational assays, and molecular simulations. We show that Cl- is not transported and does not affect Na+-mediated cytoplasmic pathway closure but does reduce the accessibility of residues in the extracellular pathway, mimicking transport-related occlusion. Simulations indicate that Cl- ion binding constrains the helices in the so-called bundle but not interactions spanning the extracellular pathway thought to act as a molecular gate. We surmise that Cl- (i) increases the stability of surrounding helices, (ii) enhances Na+ binding affinity, and (iii) decreases extracellular pathway accessibility, thereby facilitating transport-related conformational changes.

These repeat sequences undergo a non-canonical translation known as repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. Unlike canonical translation, RAN translation initiates from non-AUG codons and occurs in all reading frames. To identify potential regulators of RAN translation, we employed a bottom-up approach using a human factor-based reconstituted cell-free translation system to recapitulate RAN translation. This approach revealed that omission of either eIF1A or eIF5B enhanced the translation in all reading frames of C9orf72-mediated RAN translation (C9-RAN), suggesting that eIF1A and eIF5B act as repressors of RAN translation. eIF1A and eIF5B are known to contribute to the fidelity of translation initiation. In HEK293T cells, double knockdown of eIF1A and eIF5B further promoted C9-RAN compared to single knockdowns, indicating that these factors regulate C9-RAN through distinct initiation steps. Furthermore, under eIF1A knockdown conditions, the enhancement of RAN translation via the integrated stress response (ISR) was not observed in HEK293T cells, indicating that eIF1A is involved in the ISR-mediated non-AUG translation.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

In this study, we confirmed that micromolar concentrations of human CXCL17 activate human MRGPRX2 in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells using a NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT)-based {beta}-arrestin recruitment assay. We further demonstrated that human CXCL17 also activates MRGPRX1 and MAS1 among 10 human MRGPRs in the same assay. CXCL17 could also induce chemotactic movement of transfected HEK293T cells expressing MRGPRX2, MRGPRX1, or MAS1. However, removal of C-terminal residues from CXCL17 did not affect its activation of these three MRGPRs, even though this region is essential for GPR25 activation. These results suggest that CXCL17 activates MRGPRX2, MRGPRX1, and MAS1 through a mechanism distinct from GPR25 activation.

A.; Castilho, M.; Borau, C.", "abstract": "Background: The development of regenerative biomaterial scaffolds with mechanical properties tailored to native soft tissues remains a challenge in tissue engineering. Mechanical metamaterials with auxetic architectures have taken enormous flight over the past years, as they offer improved control over mechanical function and performance through spatially defined material architecture. However, despite their potential, auxetic scaffold designs are often developed empirically, and the relationship between scaffold microarchitecture, mechanical function, and manufacturability remains poorly defined, limiting their applicability in tissue engineering. In this study, we present a computational framework for the rational design of auxetic fiber scaffolds manufactured using Melt Electro-writing (MEW) for soft tissue engineering. To address the challenge of tailoring scaffold mechanical properties to native tissue, we integrated finite element method (FEM) modeling with experimental validation to predict the mechanical behavior of the scaffolds. Method: The micro-fibrous scaffolds with customizable auxetic re-entrant structures were designed using Python scripts for generating G-code used in fabrication and for model definition in FEM modeling, respectively. Four distinct auxetic structures were selected for this study to cover the wide range of mechanical properties of soft tissue, and their geometry parameters were adjusted to reduce the pore size while considering printing resolution. FEM modeling was employed to predict the mechanical behavior of the scaffolds. To validate the predictions, the scaffolds were manufactured via MEW and characterized mechanically under biaxial tensile loading. Results and conclusion: MEW manufacturing enabled the production of auxetic fiber scaffolds with sub-millimeter pore resolution, while rational design allowed to correct fabrication discrepancies and improve printed design fidelity. Experimental biaxial characterization of the scaffolds revealed design-dependent, biphasic, non-linear mechanical response, and the developed FEM model was capable of not only accurately simulating the observed mechanical response but also accounting for variations introduced by MEW during fabrication. Additionally, auxetic scaffolds supported fibroblast viability over 7 days, confirming biocompatibility as a first step toward soft tissue engineering. The good alignment between numerical predictions and experimental results highlights the value of FEM modeling as a powerful computational tool for guiding the design and optimization of auxetic scaffolds with tailored mechanical performance for specific soft tissue requirements. The presented methodology offers a significant advancement in the development of functional biomaterials for biomedical applications.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Recent work on insight and information processing suggested feelings of aha as a metacognitive feedback signal. A series of processes, from curiosity (drive state) to insight (uncertainty reduction) to pleasure (reward and reinforcement), might represent a fundamental epistemic arc for motivated learning. Here, we present a paradigm that combines measurement of curiosity, insight (aha), understanding and liking to outline the contours of this epistemic arc and study their neuronal mechanisms. In two preregistered experiments we employ the so called \"title effect\" - the fact that additional semantic information accompanying an artwork (such as titles) can change how an observer understands and enjoys a piece of visual art. Participants viewed paintings (5s trials) and rated their curiosity for seeing the title. This was followed either by the original title or a dummy title lacking additional information (\"untitled\"), and a second presentation of the painting, after which participants rated strength of aha, aesthetic liking, and feeling of understanding the artwork. In a behavioral online study (N=55 participants) we replicate a set of previous findings and established that visual art together with their titles can prompt strong feelings of aha. The association between the collected ratings is complex, partly nonlinear, and shaped by the type and amount of information provided by the stimulus material. In an EEG, ECG and eye tracking study with the same paradigm (N=49 participants) we aimed to characterize the temporal sequence of processing. Using a time-resolved decoding approach we were able to recover the categorical experimental conditions and the graded ratings: curiosity for the title could be decoded late in pretitle trials and early in the posttitle trials; aha could be decoded in posttitle trials; felt understanding had the most robust signature among the ratings and could be decoded from multiple signals in both pre and posttitle trials. Lastly, ratings of aesthetic liking were hard to decode from the data with only a short significant timewindow early during posttitle trials.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

However, it is unclear if transitory or dynamic variation in the functional brain architecture is a marker of disruptive behavior problems. The current study tested whether functional connectivity across dynamic networks is distinctly associated with the transdiagnostic symptom domain of disruptive behavior problems in children. Methods: Participants were aged 9-10 years from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, who completed resting-state fMRI (N=877). We employed a dynamic connectivity approach leveraging a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) to identify transient properties of brain networks and states. Models estimated the time spent in each state (occupancy time) and the number of consecutive timepoints in a state (dwell time) for each participant. Linear regression models were utilized to identify distinct associations between dynamic properties (occupancy and sojourn times) and severity of disruptive behavior problems, accounting for other commonly co-occurring symptoms. Results: Dynamic network markers of disruptive behavior problems included increased time in network states characterized by globally aberrant connectivity patterns in circuitry involved in cognitive control including frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. Replication of findings was found in a held-out sample of resting-state fMRI runs in which greater severity of disruptive behavior problems was uniquely linked to greater occupancy time in similarly characterized brain states. Conclusion: Transdiagnostic, dynamic resting-state markers of disruptive behavior problems in youth may assist in the development of brain-based biomarkers for monitoring treatment outcomes, assessing circuit target engagement and informing clinical decisions.", "date": "2025-05-20", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, the sole exposure of mice to coinfected secretome lead to the loss of cerebral VE-cadherin and ZO-1 and the induction of neuroinflammation, characterized by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-, amyloidogenic accumulation, and neurocognitive deficits.
