However, how smell and taste are integrated in the nervous system to drive feeding remains elusive. We show in Drosophila that odors alone activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), trigger proboscis extension reflex (PER), a canonical taste-evoked feeding behavior, and enhance food intake. Odor-evoked PER requires the function of sugar-sensing GRNs but not olfactory organs. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording show that GRNs directly respond to odors. Odor-evoked PER is mediated by the Gr5a receptor, and is bidirectionally modulated by olfactory binding proteins. Finally, odors and sucrose co-applied to GRNs synergistically enhance PER and food consumption. These results reveal a cell-intrinsic mechanism for odor-taste multimodal integration that takes place as early as in GRNs, indicating that unified chemosensory experience is a product of layered integration in peripheral neurons and in the brain.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

I.; Mitri, S.", "abstract": "There is increasing interest in artificially selecting or breeding microbial communities, but experiments have reported modest success. Here, we develop computational models to simulate two previously known selection methods and compare them to a new ``disassembly'' method. We evaluate all three methods in their ability to find a community that could efficiently degrade toxins, whereby investment into degradation resulted in slower growth. Our disassembly method relies on repeatedly competing different communities of known species combinations against one another, while regularly shuffling around their species combinations. This approach allows many species combinations to be explored, thereby maintaining enough between-community diversity for selection to act on, and resulting in communities with high performance. Nevertheless, selection at the community level in our simulations did not counteract selection at the individual level, nor the communities' ecological dynamics. Species in our model evolved to invest less into community function and more into growth, but increased growth compensated for reduced investment, such that overall community performance was barely affected by within-species evolution. Within-community ecological dynamics were more of a challenge, as we could control them during the selection process, but community composition and function dropped in the longer term. Our work shows that the strength of disassembly lies mainly in its ability to explore different species combinations, and helps to propose alternative designs for community selection experiments.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

These are embedded using graph wavelets and passed through a manifold-regularized autoencoder that preserves temporal geometry. The resulting latent trajectory is summarized using a principled set of descriptors - including curvature, path signatures, persistent homology, and recurrent networks -that capture multiscale geometric, topological, and dynamical features. These features drive downstream prediction in a modular, interpretable, and end-to-end trainable framework. We evaluate Neurospectrum on simulated and experimental datasets. It tracks phase synchronization in Kuramoto simulations, reconstructs visual stimuli from calcium imaging, and identifies biomarkers of obsessive-compulsive disorder in fMRI.

In addition, this screen revealed a potential role for the transcription factor ATF2. We demonstrate that ATF2 phosphorylation by MAP3 kinases is the core driver of the pro-apoptotic transcriptional response. Surprisingly, JUN phosphorylation is not required for apoptosis. However, the phosphorylation of ATF2 and upregulation of JUN expression are crucial. ATF2 therefore converts the kinase signal into a transcriptional response. Inhibiting ATF2 in cultured human neurons prevents cell death. Notably we show that ATF2 knockdown is neuroprotective in injury models in vivo. Thus, ATF2 provides a promising new target for a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Previous work has demonstrated that humans respond appropriately to changes in volatility, but there is less evidence of a rational response to noise. Here we test adaptation to variable levels of volatility and noise in human participants, using choice behaviour and pupillometry as a measure of the central arousal system. We find that participants adapt as expected to changes in volatility, but not to changes in noise.

This study developed an intelligent molecular cytology approach with improved diagnostic objectivity and broader sampling coverage. Our method, Multi-Instance Cytology with Learned Raman Embedding (MICLEAR), is characterized by compositional information provided by label-free Raman imaging. First, 4085 cells were brushed off from the pancreases of 41 patients and imaged using stimulated Raman scattering microscopy.

Their origins are hypothesized to predate or coincide with the diversification of eukaryotes, and they have been detected in hosts that span the eukaryotic tree of life. But surprisingly, such viruses have not been definitively found in Kingdom Fungi, though genomic and metagenomic work suggests a putative association. Here we report both viral fossils and active infection by giant viruses in fungi, particularly in the zoosporic phyla Blastocladiomycota and Chytridiomycota. The recovered viral genomes span up to 350 kb, encode over 300 genes, and form a monophyletic family-level clade within the Nucleocytoviricota related to orders Imitervirales and Algavirales, which we name Mycodnaviridae. We observed variation in infection status among the isolates including apparent active infection and transcriptionally-suppressed states, suggesting that viral activation may be constrained to certain life stages of the host. Our experimental findings add to the limited natural virus-host systems available in culture for the study of giant viruses. These viruses may have shaped the early evolution of these fungal lineages by the shuttling of genes between major kingdoms and domains of life. Our findings expand the known host range of Nucleocytoviricota into a new kingdom that contains many model species.

We combine single-cell multiomics with parallel colony-forming assays to link HMA-induced heterogeneity with functional consequences in AML cellss. Azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC) induced global epigenetic heterogeneity, associated with upregulation of inflammatory responses and cell death pathways in a subset of hypomethylated cells. Some cells maintained high DNA methylation levels during treatment, and these methylation-retaining cells had increased self-renewal capacity following DAC treatment in two FLT3-ITD AML cell lines. Transcriptional profiling of colonies formed after HMA treatment revealed many genes with altered expression in both methylation-retaining and hypomethylated cells, with increased expression of cholesterol-related genes observed in all cell lines. Inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway by rosuvastatin enhanced HMA effects on colony formation in vitro and extended survival in two in vivo models of AML.

Here we report an accidental discovery: Electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) of live fruit flies reveals that phosgene exposure results in a distinctive manganese () hyperfine structure. After exposure to phosgene, every batch of flies consistently displays the Mn () signal. Regardless of the aftercare provided, these flies inevitably perish, making the signal a diagnostic of phosgene poisoning in flies. The intensity of the signal is dependent on both exposure time and concentration, resembling the kinetics of phosgene poisoning. The signal of Mn () correlates with the presence of a functional superoxide dismutase Sod2. After exposure, heterozygous Sod2 mutants have a markedly lower intensity of Mn () in their ESR spectrum. We suggest that phosgene disturbs Mn redox cycling between ESR-silent Mn () and ESR-active Mn () that is required for superoxide dismutation. Accordingly, mitochondria of phosgene-treated flies show reduced rates of hydrogen peroxide production, and severely compromised complex I-linked respiration. It is likely that phosgene damages mitochondria through MnSOD and complex I, which contributes to its toxicity.

Behavioural analysis confirmed adjustments in the decision criterion and confidence ratings according to the cued probabilities and previous choice-induced biases.

Currently, the behaviour of these methods when faced with genomic datasets from evolutionary scenarios other than the human lineage remains unknown.

This phenomenon has been studied using a force matching task, in which observers are first exposed to an external force on a passive finger and then instructed to reproduce the sensation by directly pressing on the passive finger with a finger of the other hand: healthy participants consistently exceed the original force level. However, this exaggeration of the target force is not observed if the observer generates the matching force indirectly, by adjusting a joystick or slider that controls the force output of a motor. Here we present the first detailed computational account of the processes leading to exaggeration of target forces in the force matching task, incorporating attenuation of sensory signals based on motor predictions. The model elucidates previously unappreciated contributions of multiple sources of noise, including memory noise, in determining matching force output, and shows that quantifying attenuation as the discrepancy between direct and indirect self-generated forces isolates its predictive component. Our computational account makes the prediction that attenuated sensations will display greater trial-to-trial variability than unattenuated ones, because they incorporate additional noise from motor prediction. Quantitative model fitting of new and existing force matching data confirmed the prediction of excess variability in self-generated forces and provided evidence for a divisive rather than subtractive mechanism of attenuation, while highlighting its predictive nature.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

We measured rates of carbon (C) exudation in 11 trees species that exhibit divergent root traits, including gymnosperms and angiosperms that associate with either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi. Our goal was to explore how tree species, plant functional groups and root traits collectively influence exudation patterns. Intraspecific variation in exudation rates was larger than interspecific variation, and neither functional groups nor morphological traits alone could sufficiently explain variation in this flux. EcM-associated gymnosperms exuded 2.4 times more C than EcM angiosperms and 1.5 times more than AM gymnosperms. Exudation rates correlated positively with specific root length (SRL) and specific root area (SRA), and were correlated with root tissue density and root diameter in EcM-associated species. Mixed-effect models revealed that exudation rates were best determined by a combination of phylogenetic group, tree-mycorrhizal type and SRA, though a large portion of unexplained variation suggests that contemporary environmental and local edaphic conditions are likely important. Collectively, our results reveal that exudation is a complex physiological process governed by multiple factors and cannot be fully explained by functional groups or root traits alone. Instead, a combined consideration of these factors and new experimental approaches may be needed before exudation patterns can be linked to plant trait frameworks and incorporated into large-scale models.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

To address this need, the All of Us research program (AoU) generated whole-genome sequences of 245,388 individuals (release v7) who collectively reflect the diversity of the USA. Leveraging this resource and another widely-used population-scale biobank, the UK Biobank (UKB) with a half million participants, we developed PRS trained on multi-ancestry and multi-biobank data with up to ~750,000 participants for 32 common, complex traits and diseases across a range of genetic architectures. We then evaluated effects of ancestry, PRS methodology, and genetic architecture on PRS accuracy across a held out subset of ancestrally diverse AoU participants. Overall, we found that the increased diversity of AoU significantly improved PRS performance in some participants in AoU, especially underrepresented individuals, across multiple phenotypes. Notably, maximizing sample size by combining discovery data across AoU and UKB is not the optimal approach for predicting some phenotypes particularly in African ancestry populations; rather, using data from only AoU for these traits resulted in the greatest accuracy. This was especially true for less polygenic traits with large ancestry-enriched effects, and larger heritability estimates in African ancestry populations, such as neutrophil count (R2: 0.055 vs. 0.035 using AoU vs. cross-biobank meta-analysis, respectively, because of e.g. DARC). Lastly, we calculated individual-level PRS accuracies rather than grouping by continental ancestry, a critical step towards interpretability in precision medicine. Individualized PRS accuracy decays linearly as a function of ancestry divergence, but the slope was smaller using multi-ancestry GWAS compared to using European GWAS.

Today, it is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with nearly 90,000 fatalities each year. By analyzing single-cell data from tumor-bearing colorectal cancer model mice with Lphn1 knockout and wild-type Lphn1, we identified five key target genes for anticancer therapy: Ulbp1, Klrk1, Ccl6, Tlr4, Cd48, Prdm5, Vstm2a, Ret, Oas2, Hdac11 and Ptchd4, along with their corresponding cell types. Additionally, we discovered tumor-inhibiting cell subpopulations, including Cd244a_T_cells_subcluster_1, Cd48_Cd244a_NK_cells_subcluster_2, and C3_Macrophages_subcluster_1, which are potential candidates for therapeutic intervention. We propose that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) serve as the primary antigen presenters for MHC class I, providing antigens to macrophages, NK cells, and T cells to combat colorectal cancer. From a cellular perspective, the knockout of Lphn1 activates the anti-colorectal cancer functions of subpopulations of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Macrophages enhance antitumor immune activity by engaging the Ulbp1-Klrk1 receptor pair to activate NK cells. Additionally, macrophages activate downstream functions of T cells against colorectal cancer through CD48 signaling. After the knockout of Lphn1, macrophages are recruited by autocrine Ccl6 and Ccl6 secReted by CAFs. They exhibit high expression of Tlr4 and have the potential to transition into M1-type macrophages due to changes in their cellular state. After the knockout of Lphn1, the CAFs were reduced by half. CAFs, which are part of the cell network communication associated with tumor cells, typically play an immunosuppressive role. A reduction by half indicates that the immunosuppression in the Lphn1 knockout group has significantly decreased. This suggests that the efficacy of various cancer immunotherapy drugs can be significantly enhanced. In specific cell types, the four colorectal cancer-resistant transcription factors Irf7, Nr2f1 (with uncertain function), Bclaf1, and Irf2 co-localize with Tlr4, Cd48, Prdm5, and Oas2, respectively, and have been analyzed by pyscenic to interact and functionally contribute to the resistance against colorectal cancer. The four differential metabolic pathways between the Lphn1 group and the luc group are Arginine and proline metabolism, Histidine metabolism, Phenylalanine metabolism, and Riboflavin metabolism, with Arginine and proline metabolism being more active in the Lphn1 group and Histidine metabolism being more active in the luc group. CAF cells in tumors originate from CT26 cells. Additionally, Nr2f1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target, particularly as a transcription factor, for the treatment of colorectal cancer. These findings could open new avenues for the treatment of colorectal cancer and contribute to the development of personalized medicine.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections frequently involve biofilms, which contribute materially to the difficulty to treat these infections with antibiotic therapy. Many biofilm-related characteristics are controlled by the second messenger, cyclic-di-GMP, which is upregulated on surface contact. Among these factors is the exopolysaccharide Psl, which is a critically important component of the biofilm matrix. Here we describe the discovery of a bacteriophage, which we have called Clew-1, that directly binds to and uses Psl as a receptor for attaching to P. aeruginosa. While this phage does not efficiently infect logarithmically growing bacteria, it can disrupt P. aeruginosa biofilms and replicate on biofilm bacteria. We further demonstrate that the bacteriophage can reduce the bacterial burden in a mouse model of P. aeruginosa keratitis, which is characterized by the formation of a biofilm on the cornea. Due to its reliance on Psl for infection, Clew-1 does not actually form plaques on wild-type bacteria under standard in vitro conditions. This argues that our standard isolation procedures likely exclude bacteriophage that are adapted to using biofilm markers for infection. Importantly, the manner in which we isolated Clew-1 can be easily extended to other strains of P. aeruginosa, which will fuel the discovery of other biofilm-tropic bacteriophage and expand their therapeutic use.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

We evaluated the self-attention of base and fine-tuned LLMs of different sizes against human eye movement and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns during naturalistic reading.

Apicomplexan parasites replicate using a variety of non-canonical cell division modes, distinct from binary fission, whose molecular regulation is incompletely understood. T. gondii replicates by endodyogeny in its intermediate hosts, and by schizogony in its definitive host. To improve our understanding of how these unusual, flexible cell division modes are regulated, we characterised the T. gondii homologues of the cell-cycle checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR. These phosphoinositol-3-kinase-like kinases are entirely absent in some related parasites including Plasmodium; in T. gondii they are present but their putative checkpoint roles were uncharacterised. Both TgATM and TgATR were found to be dispersed throughout the parasite and they did not detectably relocate to the nucleus after DNA damage. Nevertheless, they were both required for checkpoint responses to DNA damage, including acute replication slowing and phosphorylation of the DNA damage marker histone H2AX. Unusually, the two kinases seemed to cooperate in the checkpoint response, with the loss of either one largely ablating the response, regardless of the type of DNA damage. Thus, T. gondii clearly retains a DNA-damage-responsive checkpoint, but some of its key features differ from the well-studied checkpoint in human cells.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

We introduce a new distribution-matching approach to harmonizing structural brain connectivity across different sites and scanners. We evaluate our method using structural brain connectivity data from three distinct datasets (OASIS-3, ADNI-2, and PREVENT-AD), comparing its performance to the widely used ComBat method and the more recent CovBat approach. We examine the impact of harmonization on the correlation of brain connectivity with the Mini-Mental State Examination score and age. Our results demonstrate that our distribution-matching technique effectively harmonizes structural brain connectivity while maintaining non-negativity of the connectivity values, and produces correlation strengths and significance levels competitive with alternative approaches. Qualitative assessments illustrate the desired distributional alignment across datasets, while quantitative evaluations confirm competitive performance.

Many organisms harbor more than one CRISPR-Cas system, and little is known about whether and how they are differentially regulated, in many instances due to the impossibility of studying CRISPR immunity in native hosts. Here we studied the regulation of endogenous type II-B and type V-A CRISPR-Cas systems in opportunistic human pathogen Francisella novicida U112. Fluorescence microscopy and transcriptomics experiments revealed that while the type II-B system is constitutively expressed, the type V-A CRISPR-Cas system is differentially expressed at stationary phase and high cell density. Using mass spectrometry and genetics we identified MtvS as a factor required for the differential expression of the type V-A CRISPR-Cas locus. Surprisingly, MtvS-dependent expression of the type V-A CRISPR-Cas system at high cell density is linked to a quorum sensing-like behavior. In addition, MtvS modulates transcription of many genes in stationary phase, some of which are required for Francisella virulence. Pull-down experiments revealed MtvS interacts with the beta-prime subunit of the RNA polymerase and therefore may constitute a noncanonical alternative sigma factor involved in the regulation of the expression of CRISPR loci and other genes.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Multiple AD risk factors are regulators of endocytosis and are known to cause hyper-activity of the early-endosome small GTPase rab5, resulting in neuronal endosomal pathway disruption and cholinergic neurodegeneration. Adaptor protein containing Pleckstrin homology domain, Phosphotyrosine binding domain, Leucine zipper motif (APPL1), an important rab5 effector protein and signaling molecule, has been shown in vitro to interface between endosomal and neuronal dysfunction through a rab5-activating interaction with the BACE1-generated C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP-{beta}CTF), a pathogenic APP fragment generated within endosomal compartments. To understand the contribution of APPL1 to AD-related endosomal dysfunction in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse model over-expressing human APPL1 within neurons (Thy1-APPL1 mice). Strongly supporting the important endosomal regulatory roles of APPL1 and their relevance to AD etiology, Thy1-APPL1 mice develop enlarged neuronal early endosomes and increased synaptic endocytosis due to increased rab5 activation. We demonstrate pathophysiologic consequences of APPL1 overexpression, including functional changes in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), degeneration of large projection cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory. Our evidence shows that neuronal APPL1 elevation modeling its functional increase in the AD brain induces a cascade of AD-related pathological effects within neurons, including early endosome anomalies, synaptic dysfunction, and selective neurodegeneration.

Short-timescale neurons showed stronger transient visual responses, suggesting their role in rapid visual processing, whereas long-timescale neurons exhibited pronounced sustained attentional modulation, suggesting their role in maintaining stimulus-driven attention.

Among the subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is particularly aggressive and difficult to treat due to the absence of receptors for estrogen, progesterone, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, rendering TNBC refractory to conventional targeted therapies. Emerging research underscores the exacerbating role of metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, on TNBC aggressiveness. Here, we investigate the critical cellular and molecular factors underlying this link. We explore the pivotal role of circulating plasma exosomes in modulating the tumor microenvironment and enhancing TNBC aggressiveness. We find that plasma exosomes from diet-induced obesity mice induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition features in TNBC cells, leading to increased migration in vitro and enhanced metastasis in vivo. We build on our previous reports demonstrating that plasma exosomes from obese, diabetic patients, and exosomes from insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes, upregulate key transcriptional signatures of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that TNBC cells exhibit higher expression and activation of proteins related to the Rho-GTPase cascade, particularly the small Ras-related protein Rac1. Our approach suggests novel therapeutic targets and exosomal biomarkers, ultimately to improve prognosis for TNBC patients with co-morbid metabolic disorders.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Summary answer: Inhibition of CFTR dehydrates and thickens in vitro endocervical secretions. What is known already: Cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle in response to hormonal fluctuations, helping to regulate fertility and access of pathogens to the reproductive tract. CFTR is an anion channel that plays a critical role in mediating epithelial mucus secretions. Study design, size, duration: In vitro experiments conducted with control and experimental arms. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Primary endocervical cells obtained from rhesus macaques Macaca mulatta were treated with vehicle controls or CFTR inhibitor Inh-172. Hydration and viscosity of secreted mucus was measured through air surface liquid and particle tracking microrheology. Main results and the role of chance: Endocervical cells treated with CFTR inhibitor Inh-172 demonstrated dehydrated, thicker mucus secretions compared to control (p<.01). Limitations, reasons for caution: In vitro models do not fully recapitulate cellular mucus secretions. Wider implications of the findings: Cervical mucus plays an important role in fertility regulation.

To identify potential consensus transcriptional programs across animal models and human patients with AD and EP, we conducted comprehensive genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of multiple datasets. Our investigation included mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy (pilocarpine- and kainic acid-induced; n = 280), mouse models of AD (7 transgenic models expressing human tau or amyloid pathology; n = 257), and performed cross-species validation in human cohorts (EP: n = 182; AD: n = 301). Our unsupervised gene co-expression analysis revealed a highly conserved immune-related module across all models and patient cohorts. The hub consensus signatures of this module were centered around a microglial synaptic pruning pathway involving TYROBP, TREM2, and C1Q complement components. Gene regulatory network analysis identified TYROBP as the key upstream hub signature. These hub consensus signatures showed consistent upregulation in both AD and EP human bulk and single-nucleus datasets, preserved their regulatory relationship across species, and demonstrated strong diagnostic value. Computational modeling further demonstrates the asymmetric sensitivity of synaptic pruning to neural network dynamics. Loss of inhibitory synapses has a disproportionately greater impact on the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, shifting it toward hyperexcitation and increasing neural network synchronization. Our findings support a mechanistic hypothesis that identifies microglial complement-mediated synaptic pruning as a conserved central pathway linking neurodegeneration to epileptogenesis and suggested that targeting this pathway may offer therapeutic benefits for AD and EP comorbidity.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

The mean phenotypic values over time will thus predominantly be determined by the environment over time, and the trait history may be found in the fossil record. Here, I simulate such a tracking system, using both a basic non-plastic selection model and a univariate intercept-slope reaction norm model. I show how both linear and nonlinear mean phenotype vs. environment functions can be found also from quite sparse and short time series from the fossil record, and I discuss how this methodology can be extended to multivariate systems. The simulations include cases with a constraint on the individual trait values and with other factors than environment influencing the positions of the adaptive peak. The methodology is finally applied on a time series of mean phenotypic values in a record of bryozoan Microporella agonistes fossils spanning 2.3 million years, using the {partial}^18 O measure as proxy for sea water temperature. From as few as ten samples of mean phenotypic values found in the fossil record it was possible to identify a linear mean phenotype vs. environment function, and to predict the continuous mean phenotypic values as functions of time with prediction errors within the standard errors of the observations.

Amongst the many epigenetic marks, DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most studied in human populations. Given DNAm's integral role to cellular differentiation and maintenance, DNAm profiles are often highly cell type (CT)-specific and CT composition can drive salivary DNAm associations with environments or health as well as epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), discrepancy between chronological age and biological age derived from DNAm. To address this, reference-based CT deconvolution and statistically adjustment with estimated CT in DNAm analyses have become a common practice. However, it remains unclear how different CT reference panels--constructed from adult versus pediatric samples--affect DNAm results. Additionally, whether DNAm and EAA associations in saliva primarily originate from immune cells or BECs, or if they persist across saliva samples despite varying CT proportions, has yet to be examined. The current study used salivary DNAm samples obtained from 529 children (mean age=7.26 years, SD=0.26 years) in a community-based cohort, the Family Life Project. Our results highlighted the impact of estimated CT discrepancies across child and adult reference panels on DNAm associations. Upon stratifying the salivary DNAm samples into three subsamples--primarily BECs, primarily immune cells, and an approximately equal mix of both, we found significantly different EAAs across stratified samples when CT proportions were not accounted for.

The number of trees utilised by elephants increased between 2000 and 2019, but individual trees were not more intensively utilised. After almost two decades of use by elephants, we observed a reduction in the logged initial growth rate of the structural relationship between tree height and stem diameter, without modification of the asymptotic change in growth rate. Despite species-specific variability, tree height was overall reduced for a given stem diameter. Canopy area, as well as its structural relationship with stem diameter remained mostly stable. We suggest that elephants are responsible for hedging by reducing tree height. Together with impala, the dominant species in this meso-browser community, they could stimulate regrowth by browsing the canopy of the vegetation maintained in the browsing trap. Our study emphasises the necessity of long-term, species-specific studies to improve our understanding of how the browser community, and elephant in particular, affects structural relationships in trees.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptome of sex-shared neurons in adult Caenorhabditis elegans males and hermaphrodites. We uncover widespread molecular dimorphism across the nervous system, including in previously unrecognized neuron-types such as the touch receptors. Neuropeptides and signaling-related genes exhibit strong sex-biased expression, particularly in males, reinforcing the notion that neuropeptides are crucial for diversifying connectome outputs. Despite these differences, neurotransmitter identities remain largely conserved, indicating that functional dimorphism arises through modulatory, not identity-defining, changes. We show that sex-biased expression of neurotransmitter-related genes correlates with bias in outgoing synaptic connectivity and identify regulatory candidates for synaptic wiring, including both shared and sex-specific genes. This dataset provides a molecular framework for understanding how subtle regulatory differences tune conserved circuits to drive sex-specific behaviors.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

The current study tested the acute effects of daytime exposure to three experimental light conditions and one control light condition on attention and alertness with the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Healthy, young adults (N = 39; mean age: 21.7, 61.5% females) performed the PVT three times in all four light conditions presented on separate days at the same time-of-day (09:00-11:00): three experimental light conditions of short-wavelength light [SWL, 'blue', high melanopic illuminance], long-wavelength light [LWL, 'red', low melanopic illuminance], and bright white light [BWL], and a dim light [DL] condition as control. Attention and alertness measures included fluctuations in attention, quantified as the number of lapses and Reaction Time (RT) variability; mean RT; and optimum response capability (10% fastest RTs). Compared to DL, participants had significantly fewer lapses and faster mean RT during SWL and LWL, and they enhanced their optimum response capability during LWL. There were no significant effects of BWL, and light did not appear to have effects on intra-individual RT variability. Surprisingly, SWL was not superior to LWL, hence, our results suggest that light, irrespective of melanopic illuminance level, has the potential to increase alertness and attention during daytime.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

To address these limitations, we introduce FlashFold - a fast, user-friendly tool for protein structure prediction. It accelerates homology searches using a compact built-in database, enabling structure predictions up to 3-fold faster than AlphaFold3, with sacrificing little or no accuracy. Unlike others, FlashFold features adaptable built-in databases that allow users to easily incorporate their own privately sequenced data - an option that can positively influence the prediction accuracy. Moreover, it allows users to estimate stoichiometry of protein complexes directly from sequence information. To support high-throughput workflows and streamline downstream decision-making, it generates interactive and filterable summary reports, enabling users to efficiently visualize protein structures, and interpret large volumes of prediction results.

With respect to sound, pure tone working memory in humans elicits hippocampal as well as auditory cortical and inferior frontal activity, and rodent work suggests that hippocampal cells that usually track an animal's physical location can also map to tone frequency when task-relevant. We generated a sound dimension based on the density of random-frequency tones in a stack, resulting in a percept ranging from low- (\"beepy\") to high-density (\"noisy\"). We established that unlike tone frequency, which listeners automatically associate with vertical position, this density dimension elicited no consistent spatial mapping. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, human participants (both sexes) held in mind the density of a series of tone stacks and, after a short maintenance period, adjusted further stacks to match the target (\"navigation\"). Density was represented most strongly in bilateral non-primary auditory cortex, specifically bilateral planum polare. Encoding and maintenance activity in hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus, planum polare and posterior cingulate was positively associated with subsequent navigation success. Bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and hippocampus were among regions with elevated activity during navigation, compared to a parity-judgment condition with closely matched acoustics and motor demands. Bilateral orbitofrontal cortex was more active when navigation was toward a target density than when participants adjusted density in a control condition with no particular target.

Here, we found that surface CD103 and Itgae mRNA levels were significantly increased by the knockdown (KD) of Gata2 in bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs), which was accelerated by a TGF-{beta} stimulation. Since the mRNA levels of Spi1 (encoding PU.1) were increased in Gata2 KD BMMCs, we examined the effects of PU.1 on CD103 expression. As expected, CD103 levels on BMMCs were significantly decreased by Spi1 KD and increased by Spi1 overexpression. Spi1 KD suppressed Itgae expression even in the presence of TGF-{beta} in BMMCs and peritoneal MCs, whereas Gata2 KD amplified the TGF-{beta}-induced increase in Itgae expression. The amount of PU.1 binding to the cis-element in the Itgae gene was significantly and moderately increased by Gata2 KD and the TGF-{beta} stimulation, respectively. Since PU.1 is an essential transcription factor for dendritic cells (DCs), we examined the role of PU.1 in CD103 expression on DCs. The KD experiment using BMDCs showed a significant decrease in CD103 levels in Spi1 siRNA-transfected BMDCs.

A.; Moayedi, M.", "abstract": "The thermal grill, in which innocuous warm and cool stimuli are interlaced, can produce a paradoxical burning pain sensation--the thermal grill illusion (TGI). While the mechanisms underlying TGI remain unclear, prominent theories point to spinal dorsal horn integration of innocuous thermal inputs to elicit pain. It remains unknown whether the TGI activates peripheral nociceptors, or solely thermosensitive afferents and is integrated within the spinal cord. Different types of sensitization have established mechanisms and can inform TGI mechanisms: if the TGI elicits (1) primary hyperalgesia, peripheral nociceptors are activated; (2) secondary hyperalgesia in the absence of primary hyperalgesia, spinal integration is required; and (3) brush allodynia, wide-dynamic range neurons are involved in mediating the TGI. Here, we determine whether the TGI elicits primary hyperalgesia, secondary hyperalgesia or brush allodynia. Fifty-two participants underwent individually calibrated phasic thermal grill stimulation. We found that the TGI elicited primary hyperalgesia, but only in participants with component temperatures in the noxious range (<19 {degrees}C and >41 {degrees}C). The TGI also elicited secondary hyperalgesia, even in participants with strictly innocuous thermal inputs. No participants developed brush allodynia. We observed sex differences in primary hyperalgesia: only males exhibited thermal grill-induced primary hyperalgesia. These findings suggest that the TGI is integrated in the spinal dorsal horn, likely mediated by heat-pinch-cold (HPC) neurons, and, to some degree, by primary nociceptive afferents in males. This study shows that the TGI may have sex-dependent mechanisms and determines that HPC cells are involved in the illusory sensation of pain from innocuous thermal inputs.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Here we provide novel evidence that neutrophil responses differ by sex following SCI with divergent effects on long-term outcomes. We show substantial sex-dependent shifts in the phenotype of circulating and intraspinal neutrophils across time following SCI. Depletion of neutrophils immediately after SCI reveals a previously unidentified role for mature neutrophils in promoting long-term functional recovery in a sex-dependent manner. Mechanistically, mature neutrophils acquire an inflammation-resolving phenotype in the acutely injured spinal cord and depletion of mature neutrophils exacerbates long-term macrophage accumulation following SCI in a sex-dependent manner.

However, between three and two thousand years before present (BP), Celtic was widely spoken across most of Europe before being largely replaced by Germanic, Latin or Slavic1-4. Despite this rich history, how Celtic spread across the European continent remains contentious5. The debate is currently focused around three main models based on historical linguistics and archaeology: (1) a Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age spread from Central Europe associated with the Hallstatt and La Tene Cultures6-9; (2) a Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age spread along the Atlantic seaboard linked to the Bell Beaker Culture10-13; and (3) a Bronze Age spread from France, Iberia or Northern Italy14-16. Previous genomic investigations are centred around the arrival of Celtic to specific regions: Britain17, Iberia18 and Southwestern Germany19. Here, we utilise new genomic data from Bronze and Iron Age Europe to test how the population histories align with the three models of prehistoric spread of the Celtic languages. In line with the theory that Celtic spread from Central Europe during the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age, we find Urnfield-related ancestry - specifically linked to the Knoviz subgroup to have formed between 4 and 3.2 kyr BP, and subsequently expanded across much of Western Europe between 3.2 and 2.8 kyr BP. This ancestry further persisted into the Hallstatt Culture of France, Germany and Austria, impacting Britain by 2.8 kyr BP and Iberia by 2.5 kyr BP. Our findings thus agree with the model of Central European spread of the Celtic languages through consecutive expansions of the Urnfield, Hallstatt and La Tene Cultures rather than the competing models. These results demonstrate, yet again, the power of ancient population genomics in addressing long-standing debates in historical linguistics and archaeology.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

However, small effect sizes and high sampling error of covariances hinder investigations of the factors influencing this distribution. Here, we explored the potential for shared information across traits affected by the same mutations to counter sampling error, allowing robust characterisation of patterns of mutational input. Exploiting a published dataset representing 12 samples of the same mutation accumulation experiment in Drosophila serrata, we inferred robust signals of mutational effects from the concordance across samples. Krzanowski common subspace analysis identified a multivariate wing trait with statistically supported mutational variance in all samples. Importantly, this multivariate trait was aligned with the major axis of among-line (mutational) variance within most population samples. That is, despite considerable heterogeneity among samples in individual (co)variance parameter estimates, the predominant pattern of correlated mutational effects was identified in datasets reflecting a typical mutation accumulation experimental design. Two other multivariate traits were statistically supported across most samples. Smaller effect sizes (lower mutational variance) with concomitant larger sampling error or other factors (e.g., microenvironmental dependence of effects) may reduce the robustness of estimated mutational input for these traits. Overall, our results suggest sampling error does not preclude multivariate analyses of mutation accumulation experiments from extending our knowledge of pleiotropic mutational effects.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

This protocol is inexpensive to implement, without extensive additional sample preparation and can be used to capture focused images of transparent cells in a label-free manner.

Despite great progress in determining the structures of these capsids and extracellular virions in recent years, debate persists concerning the origins and temporal relationships among these capsids during capsid assembly and genome packaging. Here, we have imaged over 300,000 capsids of herpes simplex virus type 1 by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) and exhaustively classified them to characterize the structural heterogeneity of the DNA-translocating portal complex and their functional states. The resultant atomic structures reveal not only the expected A-, B-, and C-capsids, but also capsids with portal vertices similar to C-capsids but no resolvable genome in the capsid lumen, which we named D-capsids. The dodecameric dsDNA-translocating portal complex varies in their radial positions in the icosahedral capsids and structural conformations among these capsids. In D-capsids, terminal DNA density exists in multiple conformations including one reminiscent to that in C-capsids, suggesting D-capsids are products of failed DNA retention. This interpretation is supported by varying amounts of DNA outside individual D-capsids and by correlation of capsid counts observed in situ of infected cell nuclei and those after purification. Additionally, an \"anchoring\" segment of the scaffold protein is resolved interacting with the portal baskets of A- and B-capsids but not D- and C-capsids. Taken together, our data indicate that A-capsids arise from failed DNA packaging and D-capsids from failed genome retention, clarifying the origins of empty capsids in herpesvirus assembly.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

We present a method inspired by cosmological techniques for analyzing galaxy surveys, utilizing higher-order summary statistics with multivariate two- and three-point analyses in 3D Fourier space. This method offers physiological interpretability during the inference, allowing the detection of scales where brain anatomy differs across age groups, providing insights into brain aging processes. Similarly to the evolution of cosmic structures, the brain structure also evolves naturally but displays contrasting behaviors at different scales. On larger scales, structure loss occurs with age, possibly due to ventricular expansion, while smaller scales show increased structure, likely related to decreased cortical thickness and gray/white matter volume. Using MRI data from the OASIS-3 database of 869 sessions, our method predicts chronological age with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~3.1 years, while providing information as a function of scale. A posterior density estimation shows that the 1-{sigma} uncertainty for each individual varies between ~2 and 8 years, suggesting that, beyond sample variance, complex genetic or lifestyle-related factors may influence brain aging. We perform a twofold validation of the method. First, we apply the method to the Cam-CAN dataset, yielding a MAE of ~5.9 years for the age range from 18 to 88 years.

The molecular identities of interoceptors, and the functional consequences of chemosensation by specific interoceptive neurons remain to be fully described. The C. elegans pharyngeal neuronal network is anatomically and functionally homologous to the mammalian enteric nervous system. Here, we show that the I3 pharyngeal enteric neuron responds to cations via an I3-specific variant ionotropic receptor (IR) to regulate salt stress tolerance. The GLR-9 IR, located at the gut lumen-exposed sensory end of I3, is necessary and sufficient for salt sensation, establishing a chemosensory function for IRs beyond insects. Salt detection by I3 protects specifically against high salt stress, as glr-9 mutants show reduced tolerance of hypertonic salt but not sugar solutions, with or without prior acclimation. While cholinergic signaling from I3 promotes tolerance to acute high salt stress, peptidergic signaling from I3 during acclimation is essential for resistance to a subsequent high salt challenge. Transcriptomic analyses show that I3 regulates salt tolerance in part via regulating the expression of osmotic stress response genes in distal tissues. Our results describe the mechanisms by which chemosensation mediated by a defined enteric neuron regulates physiological homeostasis in response to a specific abiotic stress.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

T.; Pascoe, B.; Cooper, K.

Currently, little is known about the factors leading to these two distinct diarrheal manifestations; however, five strains of C. jejuni associated with bloody/inflammatory diarrhea and five strains associated with watery diarrhea have been characterized in the neonatal piglet diarrhea model system. Here, we demonstrate individual differences between C. jejuni strains and found that these two groups of C. jejuni strains exhibit differences in temperature dependent and independent growth rate and carbon source utilization. We show that that watery diarrhea associated C. jejuni strains grow significantly faster and have enhanced biofilm production compared to bloody/inflammatory diarrhea associated C. jejuni strains at human body temperature (37oC). Whereas bloody/inflammatory diarrhea associated strains grew faster at 42oC compared to 37oC. Using phenotypic microarrays to examine 192 carbon source utilization as a preliminary screening, we show that L-fucose is utilized differently by strains within the two diarrheal manifestation groups. L-fucose utilization is significantly higher among watery diarrhea associated strains at both 37oC and 42oC compared to bloody/inflammatory associated strains. While L-glutamine utilization is significantly higher among bloody/inflammatory diarrhea associated strains at 37oC compared to watery associated strains. Overall, these findings suggest that there are distinct metabolic adaptations of bloody/inflammatory and watery diarrhea-associated C. jejuni strains to human (37oC) and poultry (42oC) temperatures that may contribute to their differing diarrheal manifestations.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Bcnt/Cfdp1, an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) subject to various post-translational modifications, contains a putative nuclear localization sequence. Nevertheless, its subcellular localization remains ambiguous. We investigated its intracellular trafficking using diverse approaches. In C2C12 myoblasts, fluorescent protein-tagged Bcnt/Cfdp1 was predominantly localized within the nucleus, preferentially in regions of low DAPI density in myoblasts, and the localization persisted in differentiated multinucleated myotubes. Conversely, detergent-based biochemical fractionation of C2C12 and HEK293T cells indicated a substantial presence of Bcnt/Cfdp1 in cytoplasmic fractions. Quantitative proteomic analysis of fractionated proteins revealed that six IDPs, including a PEST-containing nuclear protein, demonstrated similar distribution patterns to Bcnt/Cfdp1; despite being annotated as nuclear proteins, they were detected in cytoplasmic fractions. Direct treatment of both cell lines with digitonin enabled the collection of released proteins in three steps to accurately isolate cytoplasmic proteins. Bcnt/Cfdp1 exhibited distinct extraction patterns compared to cytoplasmic soluble protein extracts in Ficoll/sucrose solution, while no differences were noted when cells underwent digitonin treatment in an isotonic solution. Quantitative proteomic analysis of these extracts highlighted the mobility or integrity of each protein within the cytoplasm. Consequently, although Bcnt/Cfdp1 is essential within the nucleus, our findings suggest its additional presence in the cytoplasm. We hypothesize that the elastic properties of Bcnt/Cfdp1 facilitate its translocation from the nucleus during subcellular fractionation, which is affected by macromolecular crowding.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Neu1 deficiency in human AD brains and 5xFAD/Neu1-/- mice leads to sialic acid retention on APP and its secretases, enhancing amyloidogenic cleavage and A{beta}42 production. Additionally, Neu1 deficiency increases lysosomal exocytosis, contributing to extracellular A{beta} release and neuroinflammation.

Most mouse hepatocytes are tetraploid (4n), which can exist as either mononucleated (1x4n) or binucleated (2x2n) cells. Despite this distinction, these two cell types have traditionally been grouped and studied as a single population. One likely reason for this is that conventional ploidy-sorting methods classify hepatocytes based solely on total DNA content, without distinguishing between mononucleated and binucleated states. In this study, we developed a novel flow cytometry strategy to distinguish and isolate 1x4n and 2x2n hepatocytes. Our approach leverages Hoechst-Area to assess total ploidy and Hoechst-Height to differentiate mononucleated and binucleated hepatocytes. Transcriptome analysis comparing these two populations revealed that 1x4n hepatocytes exhibit a broader and more metabolically active gene expression profile. Importantly, this enhanced metabolic activity was independent of liver zonation, a well-known driver of metabolic heterogeneity in hepatocytes.

In in vitro experiments that used three P. mandapamensis strains isolated from the same individual fish, we found that whichever strain arrived first dominated over the other two strains, indicating strong priority effects. We also found that the strains differed in growth and luminosity, and that the bioluminescence of the three-strain community could not be predicted from individual strain performances.

In particular, estrogen helps prevent excessive bone resorption by its impact on bone remodeling. When estrogen levels decrease, bone resorption increases, often resulting in weakened bones and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. Experimental studies have also shown that estrogen regulates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), a hormone system involved in many physiological processes, including blood pressure regulation. Additionally, the RAS has an interconnected relationship with calcium regulatory and bone remodeling systems. Given these dynamic interplays, how would perturbations in one system affect the others? To answer that question, we developed a physiology-based mathematical model that simulates the interactions of estrogen, key RAS components, calcium regulation, and bone remodeling. Through sensitivity analysis and model simulations, we investigated how declining estrogen levels affect the RAS and bone mineral density. Furthermore, we quantified how RAS inhibitors, specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, may increase bone density during post-menopausal estrogen decline.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

It is widely used in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, yet its efficiency and broader applicability remain limited. Here, we identify key floral stages and develop novel strategies to enhance AMT-FI-based genome editing. Using a dual-reporter system (RUBY and hygromycin resistance), we determined that flowers opened at 6 days post-inoculation (DPI) are optimal for high transformation efficiency, with nearly 100% of siliques harboring transformants. However, Agrobacterium infection induced ovule abortion, particularly in wild-type (Col-0) plants, whereas efr mutants lacking the EF-Tu receptor (EFR)-mediated pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) showed reduced ovule abortion. Notably, efr mutants exhibited more RUBY-positive ovules and significantly enhanced genome editing efficiency, despite showing no improvement in stable transformation rates. These results suggest that PTI restricts transient transformation rather than T-DNA integration. We further engineered stealth Agrobacterium strains expressing a chimeric EF-Tu for evading recognition by EFR. These GV3101-derived strains, named as AS201 and AS202, enhanced both transient transformation and genome editing efficiency without significantly altering stable transformation frequency. Remarkably, genome-edited T1 plants could be recovered based on phenotype or direct sequencing without the need for antibiotic selection when targeting flowers opened at 6 DPI. Our findings reveal EFR-mediated immunity as a key barrier to efficient transient transformation and genome editing via AMT-FI.

Yet, their precise physiological role remains incompletely understood. This study combines electron microscopy data with a high-fidelity poroelastic computational model to investigate the mechanical interplay at the gliovascular interface. We simulated tissue displacement and fluid flow within detailed reconstructions of the PVS, endfeet, and extracellular space (ECS) in response to cardiac-induced arteriole pulsations. Our model predicts that arteriole dilation compresses the PVS while expanding the overall endfoot sheath volume due to tangential stretch. Fluid exchange primarily occurs through inter-endfoot gaps, driven by pressure differences, rather than across the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) rich endfoot membrane. PVS stiffness critically modulates these dynamics: increased stiffness can reverse PVS volume changes and flow directionality, potentially minimizing fluid exchange at intermediate stiffness levels. While AQP4 has negligible impact on pulsation-driven mechanics, it significantly enhances osmotically driven fluid flow. These findings highlight the complex balance of forces governing gliovascular mechanics and suggest PVS composition strongly influences endfoot-parenchymal fluid exchange.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

In vitro evolution has enabled the discovery of ribozymes that catalyze diverse chemical reactions, but it is likely that many catalytic activities of RNA remain to be uncovered. Expanding our understanding of the biochemical capabilities of RNA, especially new ribozyme functions related to RNA assembly, will help to refine models of primordial genome replication and, more broadly, the origin and evolution of early life. Here, we report the discovery of a novel ribozyme ligase that catalyzes the attack of the 2'-hydroxyl group of an RNA substrate on the 5'-triphosphate of a second RNA, but only when the substrate RNA possesses a 3'-phosphate vicinal to its nucleophilic 2'-hydroxyl group. This unexpected activity emerged during a directed evolution experiment designed to isolate ribozyme ligases that use 5'-triphosphorylated RNA oligonucleotides as substrates. Because the 3'-phosphate group on the RNA substrate does not directly participate in the ligation reaction, it would be extremely challenging to design a selection strategy to isolate ribozyme ligases with this unique reactivity. The ligase's requirement for an RNA 3'-phosphate group on the substrate resembles enzymatic mechanisms found in protein-based RNA repair pathways. We propose that ribozyme-catalyzed ligation of 3'-phosphorylated RNA could have enabled the repair of cleaved RNA strands in primordial cells. We demonstrate that our in vitro evolved ribozymes ligate themselves specifically to 3'-phosphorylated RNA fragments present in heterogenous mixtures of cellular RNA, demonstrating their potential utility as enrichment reagents for profiling RNA cleavage products in transcriptomic studies. Our findings not only report a new catalytic reactivity in RNA but also provide insights into ribozyme evolution, primordial RNA repair, and potential applications in RNA sequencing.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

To address this, we have developed gorder, an analysis tool capable of calculating lipid order parameters in atomistic, united-atom, and coarse-grained systems, compatible with any force field, and applicable to both planar and curved membrane geometries. gorder is designed to be fast and versatile, providing a unified solution for lipid order calculations.

Simultaneous administration of (R)-GNE-140 and BMS-986205 (Linrodostat) preferentially halted proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, but not of their non-oncogenically transformed progenitor cells. While (R)-GNE-140 inhibits lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)A/B and thus effective glycolysis, BMS-986205, in addition to its known inhibitory activity on Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), also restricts oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), as revealed here. BMS-986205, which is being tested in multiple Phase III clinical trials, inhibits the ubiquinone reduction site of respiratory complex I and thus compromises mitochondrial ATP production. The energetic catastrophe caused by simultaneous interference with glycolysis and OXPHOS resulted in either cell death or the induction of senescence in tumor cells, with the latter being eliminated by senolytics. The frequent synergy observed with combined inhibitor treatment was comprehensively confirmed through testing on tumor cell lines from the DepMap panel and on human colorectal cancer organoids. These experiments revealed highly synergistic activity of the compounds in a third of the tested tumor cell lines, correlating with alterations in genes with known roles in metabolic regulation and demonstrating the therapeutic potential of metabolic intervention.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Recent results show that in silico prediction methodology can improve and outperform laboratory data-based methods for predictions of Vss and F. The main objectives were to evaluate the simple allometry principle for CL and CL/F, how well simple allometry predicts CL and CL/F in humans, and whether a combination of simple allometry and in silico predictions can improve predictions of CL and CL/F in humans. Methods - The literature was searched for CL and CL/F-data in animal species and man. Data from at least 2 species, and preferably 3 or 4, and humans, for each compound (only small drugs) were used for the evaluation. The software ANDROMEDA by Prosilico was used for in silico predictions. Results and Discussion - The evaluation shows limited support for the theoretical basis and empirical evidence and applicability of simple allometry for the prediction of CL and CL/F. There are many deviations from the simple allometric relationship (such as relatively low liver weight and blood flow in humans and 140-fold underprediction to 5,800-fold overprediction), skewness (including general overprediction, cases where humans deviate, and relatively high CL and low F in rats) and limited interspecies relationships (R2=0.07-0.19 for CL in animals vs humans). With 43 qualified compounds, R2 for CL and CL/F with simple allometry reached ca 1/3 (log scales). With the combination of simple allometry and in silico it was possible to improve the predictive performance. 31 to 124 % (average 68 %) improvement were found for R2, <2-fold error and median error, whereas maximum errors were reduced to 1/13 to 1/6. In silico predictions alone were even better - 19 to 176 % (average 96 %) and 1/157 to 1/25, respectively. Conclusion - Simple allometry is associated with limited theoretical and empirical support for predictions of CL and CL/F in humans, and can be clearly improved when combined with (or replaced by) new in silico prediction methodology. This is in line with the ambition to reduce and replace animal testing in drug development and need for methodological improvement.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

While MAPK-mediated transcriptional regulation has been well examined, the involvement of MAPKs in post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation is still poorly understood. In this study, we identify the RNA binding-protein AtG3BP1 as a phosphorylation target of MPK3, MPK4, and MPK6 and demonstrate that phosphorylation of AtG3BP1 at Ser257 modulates key aspects of Arabidopsis immunity. Using phospho-mimic (G3BP1D) and phospho-dead (G3BP1A) mutants, we investigated the functional consequences of AtG3BP1 phosphorylation. Our data indicate that phosphorylation of AtG3BP1 promotes susceptibility to bacterial infection, suppresses accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and downregulates salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AtG3BP1 phosphorylation influences stomatal immunity by maintaining stomatal opening, thereby regulating pre-invasive defense mechanisms. Additionally, we provide evidence that phosphorylation stabilizes AtG3BP1 and prevents its degradation via the proteasome, thus leading to sustained immune signaling. These findings validate AtG3BP1 as a central integrator of MAPK signaling during plant immunity and reveal a new level of post-translational control. This study enhances our understanding of plant defense mechanisms and provides potential targets for engineering disease-resistant crops.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

It was playable by typically developing adolescents and their autistic siblings, who spanned the spectrum, including those with profound autism. Game performance correlated with standard ASD survey scores, with ASD participants exhibiting slower learning and altered perceptual integration. Behavioral data were well fit by computational models in which perceptual and learning deficits in ASD arose from increased noise in higher-order visual processing.

SLIT2 expression has previously been linked to dementia risk. Objective: To study the association between SLIT2 expression in human vitreous humor and plasma samples and neurocognitive test scores in a cross-sectional cohort study utilizing a novel, highly-sensitive Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay for SLIT2 detection. Methods: Seventy-nine individuals with a mean age of 55.79 {+/-} 12.03 years underwent eye surgery with collection of vitreous humor, blood (plasma) collection, and neurocognitive assessment. Vitreous humor and plasma samples were analyzed by SLIT2 MSD electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Associations between SLIT2 levels in vitreous humor and plasma were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Results: We found up to a 7-fold higher level of SLIT2 in human vitreous humor compared to plasma. Lower vitreous SLIT2 levels were associated with a lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score and Immediate Recall Verbatim (IRV) z-score, and higher plasma SLIT2 was associated with a lower MoCA score. In multivariate analysis using single and multiple predictor models, the same significant associations were found when adjusted for age, sex, race, diabetic status, diabetic retinopathy status, glaucoma status, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Conclusions: SLIT2 protein levels are significantly associated with MoCA score and IRV z-score in middle-aged individuals. The relationship remained significant when adjusted for demographics, co-morbidity, and APOE genotype, suggesting SLIT2 may be a sensitive biomarker for early detection of dementia and Alzheimers disease, and warrants further studies.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

For example, risk preferences, which naturally range from risk-seeking to risk-averse, are characteristically affected in multiple pathologies, e.g. increased risk-taking in gambling disorders. Despite its basic and translational importance, how underlying brain activity reflects and determines behavioral variation is mostly unknown, in part due to the difficulty of directly examining neural activity in decision-relevant brain areas from cohorts of subjects with varying preferences. To address this, we combined human intracranial recordings (n=15 patients) from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain region in economic decision-making, with risky decision-making tasks and computational modeling. We observed significant behavioral variation in risk preferences, which was strongly correlated with low-frequency (delta-theta) oscillatory coherence in OFC. Low-frequency oscillatory phase was coupled to high-frequency activity amplitude, providing a potential neurophysiological mechanism for integrating preferences with trial-by-trial risk computations. Finally, targeted OFC electrical stimulation caused significantly decreased risk-taking behavior and faster reaction times without impairing overall decision-making. These results show a neural correlate for inter-individual variation in decision-making preferences and provide proof-of-principle evidence for modulation of risk-taking behavior through OFC-targeted neurostimulation, paving the way for developing neuromodulatory interventions for pathologies characterized by heightened risk-seeking, such as addiction and gambling disorders.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Animals, like humans, selectively binge on highly palatable foods, implying that the binge-like behavior is motivated by hedonic rather than metabolic signals. Given the association between reward processing and food intake, this study explored sex-specific underlying biological mechanisms, including synaptic, neuroimmune and neurometabolic correlates of binge-like sucrose drinking, compulsivity and anxiety-like behaviors, utilizing a preclinical model of hedonic sucrose drinking. Throughout the experiment, male and female mice binged on a sweet solution when given food ad libitum with free access and a choice between water and a 10% (w/v) sucrose solution, with females consuming more sucrose. The sucrose intake was positively correlated with transcription of genes for dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd2) in the PFC of male and female mice. Sucrose-bingeing increased PFC neuroinflammation, concomitantly increasing region-specific blood-brain barrier permeability in males. Sucrose bingeing elevated the transcription of glucose metabolism genes (Slc2a3, Glo1) while inhibiting ketone oxidation pathway genes (Slc16a1, Oxct1, Acat1) in the PFC of males and females. Nutritional ketosis attenuated sucrose bingeing, compulsivity and anxiety-like behaviors in sucrose-dependent male and female mice by suppressing the transcription of reward-related genes (Drd1, Drd2) while promoting an anti-inflammatory neuroimmune microenvironment in the PFC of male and female mice in a sex-dependent manner. Overall, this study identified synaptic, neuroimmune and neurometabolic mechanisms as novel druggable targets and nutritional ketosis as a potential therapy for diseases where binge-like eating, compulsivity and anxiety-like behaviors are the main symptoms, such as binge eating disorder.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Whether these changes reflect transcriptional dysregulation driven by genetic risk remains unclear. We introduce a novel imaging-transcriptomics framework that integrates transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) with brain transcriptomic atlases to predict macroscale structural brain abnormalities across seven disorders: ADHD, ASD, AN, BD, MDD, OCD, and schizophrenia (SCZ). We generated disorder-specific Gene Expression-based Disorder Associated Risk (GEDAR) maps and assessed their spatial correlation with observed brain alterations thereby establishing a structured approach to map polygenic transcriptional risk onto macroscale brain phenotypes. We found significant transcriptomic-anatomical correlations in MDD (cortical and subcortical), SCZ (subcortical), and ADHD (subcortical), indicating that regional transcriptional vulnerability might contribute to varying extents to the anatomical expression of genetic risk in these disorders. Pathway enrichment analysis on genetically predicted differentially expressed genes for those disorders where we found spatial correlations between GEDAR maps and observed structural changes revealed immune-related processes as dominant in MDD and SCZ, and neurodevelopmental pathways in ADHD. ASD, AN, OCD, and cortical SCZ lacked significant associations. Importantly, spatial transcriptomic-anatomical alignment did not scale with between-disorder differences in heritability, pointing instead toward additional influences like developmental timing or environmental interactions.

Given that the core deficits of dyslexia are uniquely human, animal models have not been as useful in dyslexia research as they have been in other areas of research. While significant progress has been made through behavioral and neuroimaging studies, a viable model could facilitate controlled investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia and accelerate the development of targeted interventions. In this hypothesis article, we propose a two-pronged approach to model dyslexia in neurotypical adults using neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques. First, we propose using functional and structural MRI data to cluster individuals into neuropathologically derived subgroups in order to facilitate the classification of dyslexia subtypes based on neuropathological characteristics. Second, we propose employing transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) to temporarily downregulate activity in brain regions specified in the clustering analysis, inducing subtype-specific dyslexic symptoms in neurotypical individuals. This approach enables the establishment of causal or probabilistic relationships between neuropathologies and dyslexia subtypes, while at the same time creating dyslexia models to facilitate investigation into subtype-specific interventions. By integrating neuroimaging and neuromodulation, we hope to offer a viable substitute for animal models in dyslexia and accelerate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for dyslexia.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

In extreme cases venom is used for different functional purposes across ontogenetic stages. This phenomenon occurs for example in case of horse flies (Tabanidae), which utilize venom for predation during the larval stage and for blood feeding in the adult stage. While the venom composition and activity of adult tabanids has been investigated for some species, nothing is known about the venom compounds of tabanid larvae. With the current study we provide first insights into the venom composition of larval stages of a tabanid. Besides a plethora of hydrolyzing enzymes, we find the venom of T. autumnalis larvae dominated by peptide toxins. Some of these peptide toxins could be annotated as putative neurotoxins and cytolytic peptides and these compounds likely are the main drivers of fast prey incapacitation. Previous studies identified the main functional constituents utilized by tabanid imagines for blood feeding to be protease inhibitors affecting vasoconstriction and thrombin to promote blood feeding. Interestingly we find highly similar putative protease inhibitors in the larval venom, though with relatively low expression levels. This provides a first indication for a shifted expression profile between the venom of tabanid life stages to fulfill both the predatory needs of the larvae and the blood lust of female imagines.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

We assessed and compared Aedes aegypti population dynamics and dengue (DEN) and yellow fever (YF) epidemic risks among peri-urban and intra-urban villages during the 2023-2024 DEN outbreaks in Cocody-Bingerville, southern Cote dIvoire. Methods From August 2023 to July 2024, we sampled Aedes eggs, larvae and pupae in the domestic and peridomestic ecozones of three peri-urban and three intra-urban villages. We compared Ae. aegypti larval infestation, container productivity, Stegomyia indices (house index: HI, container index: CI, and Breteau index: BI) and pupal indices (pupae per house index: PHI, pupae per container index: PCI, and pupae per person index: PPI) between the study villages. Results Aedes aegypti widely dominated Aedes fauna in both peri-urban (98.1%) and intra-urban (99.8%) villages. Immatures were sampled from seven container types. However, the most productive containers were small containers, tires and medium containers which produced 81.8% of all the pupae in the peri-urban villages, and tires and small containers yielding 83.2% in the intra-urban villages. These key containers produced substantially more pupae in the domestic ecozones (70.9%) in the peri-urban villages, but equitably between the domestic (48.8%) and peridomestic (51.2%) ecozones in the intra-urban villages. In each study village, they yielded around 90% and 80% of pupae during the short dry and long rainy seasons, respectively. CI, HI and BI were comparable between the peri-urban (29.9%, 35.9% and 41.4) and intra-urban (36.7%, 48.0% and 56.2) villages, and surpassed the World Health Organization (WHO) DEN and YF epidemic thresholds. PCI (1.26 vs. 3.38 pupae/container) and PHI (1.75 vs. 5.18 pupae/house) were lower in the peri-urban than in the intra-urban villages, while PPI (0.54 vs. 1.25 pupae/person) was similar between the villages. Unlike temperature and relative humidity, all indices were strongly associated with rainfall in all the study villages. Conclusion In Cocody-Bingerville, all sampled peri-urban and intra-urban villages exhibited high densities of Ae. aegypti immatures and habitats. Although larval habitats were diverse, a limited number of container types accounted for over 80% of pupal production. Stegomyia indices remained consistently elevated, exceeding WHO epidemic thresholds for DEN and YF across all study villages, potentially contributing to ongoing DEN outbreaks. Therefore, vector surveillance and outbreak responses should be extended to peri-urban villages, as they could act as arbovirus re-introduction sources. Community-based interventions targeting the identified key containers could help control the outbreaks. This study provides a baseline for strategically reducing human exposure to arboviruses in the study villages.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Two external validations were then conducted using data from the COMBINE and the Reina Sofia Hospital cohorts, resulting in a total of 253 individuals, 155 responders and 98 nonresponders. Results: Initial RNA-seq analysis (GSE138746) revealed 53 genes that were differentially expressed between responders and nonresponders; however, none of these genes remained significant after p value adjustment with the Benjamini Hochberg method. A small-scale genetic signature comprising the 18 most discriminatory genes was then developed, achieving a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) predictive accuracy of 88.75%.

However, the intricate and multifaceted mechanisms underlying methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity have impeded the development of effective therapeutic interventions.\n\nMethods: To establish a mouse model of cognitive decline induced by chronic methamphetamine exposure, we employed a large sample size and conducted two behavioral tests (Y-maze and novel object recognition test) at 2 and 4 weeks post-exposure. Subsequently, single-cell RNA sequencing was utilized to delineate the mRNA expression profiles of individual cells within the hippocampus. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including cell clustering and identification, differential gene expression analysis, cellular communication analysis, pseudotemporal trajectory analysis, and transcription factor regulation analysis, were performed to elucidate the cellular-level changes in mRNA profiles caused by chronic methamphetamine exposure.\n\nResults: Our findings demonstrated impairments in working memory, spatial cognition, learning, and cognitive memory. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified diverse cell types in the hippocampi of mice after 4 weeks of behavioral testing, including neuroglial cells, stromal cells, vascular cells, and immune cells. We observed that methamphetamine exerted cell-specific effects on gene expression changes associated with neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuronal support dysfunction, and immune dysregulation. Furthermore, cross-talk analysis revealed extensive alterations in cellular communication patterns and signal changes within the hippocampal microenvironment induced by methamphetamine exposure. Pseudotime analysis predicted hippocampal neurogenesis disorders and identified key regulatory genes implicated in chronic methamphetamine abuse. Transcription factor analysis uncovered regulators and pathways linked to astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation, endothelial junction integrity, microglial synaptic remodeling, and oligodendrocyte-supported neuronal cell bodies and axons. Additionally, it highlighted the role of neural precursor cells in various forms of neurodegeneration.\n\nConclusions: This study establishes a robust mouse model of cognitive impairment induced by chronic methamphetamine exposure.

However, under physiological stress such as narrowing of one of the renal arteries, heart failure, dehydration, or chronic administration of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, additional cells along the renal arterioles are transformed to the renin phenotype to meet the demands for renin and regain homeostasis. In cases of prolonged and persistent stimulation of renin cells, concentric arteriolar hypertrophy develops. The study of renin cell identity, plasticity and function often requires the isolation of this rare cell type. Here, we report on the generation of a mouse model to label renin-expressing cells with a bright fluorescent reporter under control of the Ren1c locus for the tracking and isolation of renin cells. Kidneys from adult heterozygous (Het) Ren1ctdTomato/+ mice showed tdTomato signal confined to the JG area under basal conditions, and extending along the afferent arterioles and in the intraglomerular mesangium upon treatment with captopril + low-salt diet to induce the endocrine transformation of renin cells. Unexpectedly, homozygous (Homo) Ren1ctdTomato/tdTomato mice exhibited increased tdTomato signal that extended along the afferent arterioles and into the mesangium even under normal physiological conditions, with progressive thickening of the kidney arterioles with age. Despite reduced renin immunostaining in the renal cortex, Ren1ctdTomato/tdTomato Homo mice exhibited significantly higher kidney Ren1 mRNA and circulating renin levels when compared to Het controls. Moreover, Homo mice showed significantly lower blood pressure measured under anesthesia and angiotensin I (Ang I) plasma levels, indicating compromised renin activity. In addition, Homo mice developed interstitial fibrosis and compromised kidney function. The concentric arteriolar hypertrophy phenotype observed in these mice is identical to that described when RAS is genetically or pharmacologically inhibited, including the presence of mutations in the renin gene. Unlike mice with global deletion of renin, these animals did not require neonatal saline injections to survive and did not develop other kidney abnormalities, indicating that the bicistronic approach rendered a renin hypomorphic mouse. Ren1ctdTomato mice constitute an excellent model for the bright and strong labeling of renin-expressing cells and for the study of the mechanisms involved in the development of concentric vascular hypertrophy under RAS inhibition. In addition, this model may provide a better understanding of factors controlling renin protein folding, stability, packaging, and release.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Using a BRK1-YFP reporter line, we detected BRK1 enrichment at cell edges and in primary pit fields, identified by regions of reduced propidium iodide staining. We also observed colocalization between BRK1-YFP and the PD callose stain aniline blue, further supporting BRK1s association with PD.

Using a validated behavioral task and intracranial neural recordings from orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus in 19 epilepsy patients, we examined the cross-regional interplay of sleep-oscillations and their role in memory consolidation. Orbitofrontal slow oscillations robustly modulate sleep rhythms both within and across regions. Most combinations of oscillation rates predict overnight memory consolidation, but hippocampal ripple rate and coupled hippocampal-orbitofrontal ripples were the strongest positive predictors of memory consolidation. In contrast, epileptic spikes coupled to sleep oscillations strongly predicted reduced memory consolidation, with the strongest negative effect observed when epileptic spikes were coupled to slow oscillations. These findings provide direct evidence of the hierarchical cascade of sleep oscillations in human memory processing and reveal how epileptic spikes disrupt this process in patients with epilepsy.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Natural speech encodes cues at distinct timescales. Phonetic features have modulation frequencies of 30-50 Hz, syllables and words around 4-7 Hz, and phrases 1-2 Hz. Strikingly, these frequencies mirror frequencies of endogenous network rhythms of the brain and synaptic time constants of the underlying neural circuits. Here, we suggest that endogenous brain rhythms serve as priors for speech recognition, encoding knowledge of speech structure in the dynamics of network computations. In a network of coupled oscillators, we find that speech is readily identified when characteristic frequencies of the oscillators match frequencies of circuit rhythms in the brain. When signal and circuit rhythms are mismatched, speech identification is impaired. Compared to a baseline recurrent neural network without intrinsic oscillations, the coupled oscillatory network has significantly higher performance in speech recognition across languages, but not in the recognition of signals that lack speech-like structure, such as urban sounds. Our results suggest a central computational role of brain rhythms in speech processing.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

RGC degeneration in injury and/or disease also occurs in a compartmentalized manner, with distinct injury responses in axonal and somatodendritic compartments. Thus, the goal of this study was to establish a novel microfluidic-based platform for the analysis of RGC compartmentalization in health and disease states. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived RGCs were seeded into microfluidics, enabling the recruitment and isolation of axons apart from the somatodendritic compartment. Initial studies explored axonal outgrowth and compartmentalization of axons and dendrites. We then compared the differential response of RGCs differentiated from hPSCs carrying the OPTN(E50K) glaucoma mutation with isogenic control RGCs in their respective axonal and somatodendritic compartments, followed by analysis of axonal transport. Further, we explored the axonal transcriptome via RNA-seq, focusing on disease-related axonal differences. Finally, we established models to uniquely orient astrocytes along the axonal compartment combined with modulation of astrocyte reactivity as a pathological feature of neurodegeneration. Overall, RGC culture within microfluidic chips allowed enhanced cell growth and maturation, including long-distance axonal projections and proper compartmentalization, while patient-specific RGCs exhibited axonal outgrowth deficits as well as decreased rate of axonal transport. Finally, the induction of astrocyte reactivity uniquely along the proximal region of RGC axons led to the onset of neurodegenerative phenotypes in RGCs. These results represent the first study to effectively recapitulate the highly compartmentalized properties of hPSC-derived RGCs in healthy and disease states, providing a more physiologically relevant in vitro model for neuronal development and degeneration.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

This study examined longitudinal changes in multishell diffusion MRI-derived metrics in 25 individuals with depression, with scans acquired two hours before and after their first ECT session. Follow-up scans were collected within 14 days and 6 months after the last ECT session. To control for potential confounding effects of anesthesia and repeated measurements, two additional groups were included: 16 individuals undergoing short-acting anesthesia and 16 healthy controls without interventions. A multicompartment model was applied to explore extracellular free water and microstructures in the intracellular/extracellular compartments. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses identified a pattern consistent with vasogenic edema (e.g., increased extracellular free water) in widespread bilateral brain regions following a single ECT session. Increases in brain tissue free water were significantly correlated with electrical stimulus charge (r=0.51, p=0.01) but not with post-ictal reorientation time (r=0.11, p=0.92). These changes were not observed in either control group. Follow-up assessments confirmed that the alterations in tissue free water resolved within 14 days. A single ECT-induced seizure induces transient, reversible changes consistent with vasogenic edema, rather than irreversible cellular injury typically associated with cytotoxic edema. These reversible changes may represent an initial disruptive phase that facilitates subsequent adaptive brain responses, including neuroplasticity and network reorganization underlying the therapeutic effects of ECT.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we evaluated the impact of various preconditioning strategies on dendritic cell (DC) vaccine efficacy in a murine tumor model. Mice bearing syngeneic KP tumors expressing ovalbumin received preconditioning with low-dose radiation (LD RT; whole body or tumor only), cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, LD RT plus cyclophosphamide, or no preconditioning, followed by administration of antigen-loaded DC1s. Tumor growth, survival, and antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were assessed. LD RT preconditioning, whether whole body or tumor-directed, significantly enhanced vaccine-induced antitumor CD8+ T-cell responses and improved survival compared to DC vaccine alone and all other groups. Cyclophosphamide preconditioning reduced vaccine efficacy and negated the benefits of LD RT, while paclitaxel had no significant effect. Notably, whole-body LD RT induced the strongest antigen-specific T-cell response. These findings demonstrate that, similar to CAR T-cell therapy, preconditioning regimens can significantly influence cancer vaccine outcomes. Rational selection of preconditioning agents may either maximize or minimize the therapeutic potential of DC cancer vaccines, and should be considered carefully in clinical trials.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

However, the relationship between skin sympathetic nerve activity (SKNA) and gut microbiota in ACS patients remains largely unexplored. We hypothesize that elevated SKNA may interact with specific microbial profiles in ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifteen ACS patients with age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled in this study. Subjects with type 2 diabetes or those taking antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, or metformin were excluded. Demographic and clinical data were recorded, and SKNA was measured by neuECG. Gut microbial profiles were analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Significant differences in alpha diversity, including Chao 1 index and Faith's phylogenetic diversity, were observed between the ACS and control groups (P<0.001). Distinct beta diversity between the two groups was also identified using unweighted normalized UniFrac analysis (P=0.001). Redundancy analysis and Mantel test revealed a significant relationship between SKNA and microbial profiles. Several butyrate-producing bacteria were decreased in the ACS group, while the genus Hungatella, a trimethylamine producer, showed a significant increase and was positively correlated with SKNA. Additionally, predicted microbial functional analysis indicated an elevation in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis in the ACS group. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to establish an association between SKNA and gut microbial profiles in ACS patients.

This process consists of two major steps: phosphorylation of the receptor by GPCR kinases (GRKs), predominantly on its C-terminus, and recruitment of arrestin, resulting in different signaling outcomes. We carried out an NMR-based study of the phosphorylation patterns generated by GRK1 and GRK2 on C-terminal peptides of selected receptors (rhodopsin for GRK1, and {beta}1- and {beta}2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) for GRK2). Our data reveal that the kinases are promiscuous with respect to the substrate peptide, but produce clearly defined phosphorylation patterns on each substrate. We found pronounced differences in the rates at which certain residues are phosphorylated, in particular in the PXPP motifs in rhodopsin and {beta}1AR. These results show, that GRKs produce well-defined phosphorylation patterns in absence of further modulators like the full receptor or G{beta}{gamma}, and that the time profile of the phosphorylation barcode seems to be largely encoded in the minimal pair of C-terminal peptide and GRK. The data further suggest that arrestin might encounter different phosphorylation barcodes over time, potentially inducing different responses at different time points in the desensitization process.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Current therapeutic strategies for modulating cholesterol levels in CRC are limited and often come with complications. Here, we demonstrated that microbiome shunting of intestinal cholesterol to anticancer metabolites is a safe and applicable therapeutic approach for CRC. By screening major microbial metabolic products of cholesterol, we found that 4-cholesten-3-one (4-C-3) was selectively depleted in fecal samples and tumor tissues of patients with CRC. 4-C-3 exhibits strong antitumor effects on human CRC cell lines, patient-derived organoids, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Mechanistically, 4-C-3 suppresses CRC tumorigenesis by dually targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS). 4-C-3 directly binds to EGFR, blocking its signal transduction by inhibiting the binding of EGFR ligands. Additionally, 4-C-3 inhibits oncogenic KRAS variants, such as KRASG12D, by suppressing nucleotide exchange activity and effector engagement. By targeting both EGFR and KRAS, 4-C-3 reduces primary resistance to anti-EGFR therapies caused by KRAS mutations in CRC. As a proof-of-concept study, we showed that delivery of 4-C-3 by Oscillibacter ruminantium, a 4-C-3-producing commensal bacterium that is reduced in CRC patients, or a nonpathogenic Escherichia coli strain engineered to specifically convert intestinal cholesterol into 4-C-3, removed intratumoral cholesterol and led to rapid tumor regression in multiple models of CRC.

Objective In this study, we assessed olfactory sensitivity in a knock-in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AppNL-G-F mice) that recapitulates key features of human AD pathology. Methods To evaluate odor detection thresholds, we employed an olfactory assay that leverages innate behavior without requiring associative learning. Six odorants representing distinct functional groups were tested in wild-type (WT) and AppNL-G-F mice at 2 and 4 months of age. Results AppNL-G-F mice exhibited odorant-specific hyposmia at 4 months of age, coinciding with amyloid deposition in cortical and subcortical regions but preceding measurable cognitive deficits. Unexpectedly, at an earlier stage (2 months), these mice showed odorant-specific hyperosmia to ester odorants, which transitioned to hyposmia by 4 months, indicating dynamic, age-dependent alterations in olfactory sensitivity as AD pathology progresses.

To address this, there is growing interest in uncovering novel chemicals with analogous protective qualities. This may not only enhance vitrification efficacy but also mitigate toxic effects. In the current study, we employed a high throughput method to assess the toxicity of 21 compounds at room temperature, both individually and in binary combinations. Our analysis revealed that toxicity increases with both exposure duration and concentration, and that several CPA combinations result in reduced overall toxicity. Notably, among all tested mixtures, four binary combinations - formamide/glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide/1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol/diethylene glycol, and 1,3-propanediol/diethylene glycol - produced a statistically significant decrease in toxicity, resulting in significantly higher viability for the 6 mol/kg mixture than both corresponding 6 mol/kg single CPA solutions.

However, a major limitation is the immaturity of cardiomyocytes, restricting their ability to mimic adult cardiac physiology. Additionally, the inadequacy of commonly used extracellular matrices (ECM), which fail to replicate the biochemical and mechanical properties of natural heart tissue, poses significant challenges. Consequently, structural integrity in cardiac organoids is impaired. Moreover, scalability remains an obstacle, as conventional ECM substitutes hinder mass production of organoids for high-throughput toxicology screening. To overcome these challenges, we developed an advanced model promoting fibroblast-driven ECM self-secretion, enabling physiologically relevant tissue architecture and function. Using the ECM-free, mature cardiomyocyte-integrated organoid model, we investigated the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent known to impair cardiac function. Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells were characterized for maturity by immunostaining for cTNT and MYL2 alongside gene expression analysis. Organoids treated with doxorubicin showed reduced size and increased collagen deposition. These structural changes correlated with functional impairments, including decreased contraction rate and disrupted synchronous beating. In 2D culture, exposure to doxorubicin induced fibroblast activation, promoted endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in endothelial cells, and triggered cytotoxic effects in cardiomyocytes. This study highlights the importance of ECM remodeling in advancing cardiac organoid models and demonstrates its potential for more accurate cardiotoxicity assessment. Addressing these limitations enhances the physiological relevance of cardiac organoid systems for drug safety assessment and cardiac disease modeling.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

We characterized Ca2+ waves at single-cell resolution within the multicellular network of the intact heart and identified propagating dynamics and mechanisms facilitating arrhythmogenesis at tissue level. Methods: Living myocardial slices (LMS) from HF and non-HF human hearts were prepared from left ventricular tissue and paced at 2 Hz under adrenergic stimulation. Ca2+ transients and waves were recorded by wide-field imaging of Fluo-8. Ca2+ waves in relation to single-cell structures within each LMS were identified using custom algorithms. Computational modelling assessed whether experimentally observed HF Ca2+ waves dynamics can lead to focal excitation in tissue models. Results: Following pacing, early-onset Ca2+ waves, initiating within the first 2 seconds, were more frequent in HF compared to non-HF, and HF cardiomyocytes had more foci, where Ca2+ waves originate, than non-HF. Spatial mapping showed that early onset waves in HF occurred frequently in clusters of neighboring cells. Although early onset Ca2+ waves propagated similar distances in HF and non-HF cardiomyocytes, they more frequently crossed cell boundaries in HF. Particularly, HF LMS exhibited more side-to-side Ca2+ propagation, correlating with increased connexin 43 distribution to lateral membranes. Furthermore, HF LMS exhibited more local and global triggered Ca2+ activities compared to non-HF LMS, correlating with local tissue depolarization. Simulations of HF Ca2+ wave dynamics in remodeled tissue demonstrated a greater capacity to elicit focal excitation. Conclusions: In human HF, a higher incidence of early onset Ca2+ waves combines with altered intercellular connectivity to create synchrony in clusters of nearby cells that can overcome the current sink, thereby increasing arrhythmia susceptibility.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

A total of 45 adults who exercise regularly were assigned to perform a single session of either low-intensity continuous (LOW; 60min at 30% VO2max; n=15), moderate-intensity continuous (MOD; 45min at 65% VO2max; n=15), or high-intensity interval exercise (HIGH; 10x1min at 90% VO2max interspersed with 1min active recovery; n=15). aSAT biopsy samples were collected before and 1.5hours after the exercise session for bulk RNA sequencing and targeted protein immunoassays. HIGH upregulated genes involved in cytokine secretion, insulin signaling, and proteolysis while MOD and LOW upregulated genes regulating ECM remodeling, ribosome biogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Exercise-induced changes in aSAT angiogenic, MAPK cascade, and clock genes, ERK protein phosphorylation, and circulating cytokines were similar after all three exercise treatments. Network analysis identified exercise-responsive gene clusters linked to cardiometabolic health traits. Cell-type analysis highlighted a heterogeneous response of aSAT cell types to exercise, with distinct patterns observed across exercise intensities. Collectively, our data characterizes early responses in aSAT after a single session of exercise. Because adaptations to exercise training stem from an accrual of responses after each session of exercise, these early responses to exercise are likely important contributors to the long-term structural and functional changes that occur in adipose tissue in response to exercise training.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

This phenomenon, known as transcriptional bursting, drives high intercellular variability in gene expression levels. How do key patterning genes in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos overcome this variability to establish precise spatial patterns for tissue development? To address this question, we study single cell transcriptional activity from MS2-based live imaging data of four transgenic constructs (rho, Kr, sna shadow, sna proximal enhancers) and the endogenous eve gene. We developed an algorithm to infer promoter states in hundreds of cells within the embryo using transcriptional activity data. Results show that while mean transcription levels exhibit spatial gradients, the burst duration and inter-burst timing remain surprisingly invariant across the embryo and different constructs. The time between consecutive bursts was consistent with a memoryless exponential distribution, whereas the burst duration exhibited tighter control with lesser stochastic variations. Our analysis identified two regulatory mechanisms for gene expression gradients: (1) similar burst-timing statistics across genes, with the activity time (the time from the first to the last burst) being modulated to regulate distinct expression levels; (2) for the same gene with different enhancers (sna shadow and sna proximal), we observed changes in the mean burst duration and variability of the inter-burst timing. This study provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing transcriptional bursting kinetics, revealing activity time as a major regulator of spatiotemporal expression patterning in early embryonic development.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Using image flow cytometry and binding assays with NKp46-Ig and NCR1-Ig fusion proteins, we demonstrate that NKp46 selectively binds to hyphae. This interaction is mediated by the D2 domain of NKp46 and is sialic acid independent. Blocking NKp46 impairs NK cell degranulation and fungal killing in vitro. In vivo, mice deficient in NCR1 exhibit increased susceptibility to systemic C. albicans infection. Our findings establish NKp46 as a key sensor of invasive fungal morphology and underscore its role in early antifungal immunity.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

C.; Branciamore, S.; Rodin, A. S.; Lee, P. P.", "abstract": "The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is fundamental for immune system regulation. It involves phosphorylation of several types of STAT proteins in response to binding of cytokines to immune cell receptors. Traditionally, the immune signaling studies focus on measuring the levels of phosphorylated STATs (pSTATs) following individual cytokine application. We developed an experimental approach, based on multiparametric flow cytometry, to simultaneously measure the levels of five pSTATs after 15 minutes of cell treatment with high doses of individual cytokines and their paired combinations. Analysis of our experimental data involving peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors reveals systematic suppression of IL-10R, IL-6R, and IL-2R{beta}{gamma} signaling in T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. This suppression is mediated by at least all tested cytokines that do not induce relevant pSTATs by themselves. Remarkably, the cytokines with negligible own signaling do act as prominent selective signaling suppressors. In contrast, the signaling of IFNAR, IFNGR, IL-4R, and IL-2R{beta}{gamma} remains largely unaffected by co-application of other cytokines. We propose that this pattern of signaling suppression represents an evolutionary developed mechanism enhancing the promptness, specialization, and efficiency of the immune response, while increased concentration of cytokines serves as a danger signal of inefficient response. We hypothesize that selective signaling suppression arises from the differential sensitivity of conformations of cytokine-receptor complexes to the increase of cell surface tension and stiffness, which is caused by effects following the binding of cytokines to membrane-associated molecules, including glycocalyx elements. While the rewiring of immune cell signaling should represent a powerful evolutionary tool for augmentation of adaptive response, it should also lead to the prolonged suppression of counteracting signaling pathways, culminating in cytokine release syndrome and contributing to autoimmune diseases.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

This structure is surprising, particularly in highly recombinogenic species like Streptococcus pneumoniae} because recombination typically breaks down linkage disequilibrium, the non-random association of alleles at different loci. Allelic diversity is a necessary condition of strain structure. Recent work suggests that multi-locus negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) acts to maintain diversity across bacterial genomes. Here, using modelling and genomic analysis, we show that multi-locus NFDS also shapes bacterial strain structure through emergent epistatic effects. We develop models of two NFDS mechanisms -- metabolic niche differentiation and competition-colonisation trade-offs -- and show that epistasis emerges readily in these models. Notably, both models generate frequency-dependent epistasis. Unlike classical epistasis, this acts to either reinforce or abolish existing strain structure, making observed allele associations contingent on the evolutionary history of the population. We then use a dataset of over 3000 S. pneumoniae genomes to test our model predictions, and make observations consistent with emerging epistatic effects on gene associations. Our results extend and generalise previous work on the role of antigen-specific acquired immunity (a diversity-maintaining mechanism) on strain structure.

The Asian dampwood termite, Hodotermopsis sjostedti, has been well-studied as a model basal termite of caste differentiation processes. Yet, their pair formation remains undocumented. In this study, we found that mating pairs of H. sjostedti show clear tandem running behavior. Both females and males played a leading role, with females showing more leader roles, and they switched their leading roles even within the same pair. We also found that dish size affected tandem movement coordination; pairs showed faster and more stable tandem running in a larger dish.

To address these limitations, we developed INLAomics, a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian framework that models protein abundance in tissue sections by leveraging histological features and latent spatial factors inferred from spatial transcriptomics data. INLAomics supports two key applications: (1) identifying spatial gene co-expression programs to build interpretable gene protein networks, and (2) predicting spatial protein expression in tissues lacking proteomics measurements. Applied across diverse datasets, INLAomics reveals previously unrecognized gene protein associations and achieves substantial improvements in protein prediction accuracy over models that treat each modality independently.

While immediate nestling survival can easily be measured, long-term survival is more challenging to evaluate. Early-life telomere length has been suggested as a potential biomarker of future fitness prospects. To evaluate the potential impact of changes in early-life temperature, we thus experimentally increased (ca. +2.8C) and decreased (ca. -1.7C) average nestbox temperatures in wild pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) during nestling postnatal growth, and measured nestling telomere length before fledging.

Conversely, both of these neuronal activities are negatively impacted during the early phases of ALS development, following instrumentation of the cervical spine through an anterior approach and broadly by delivery of surgical and radiation-based treatments for head and neck cancer. Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the individualized fMRI neuromodulation (iNM) intervention pioneered by the Papageorgiou Lab (U.S. Patent No.16/954,256; European Patent No. 19 753 851.5) in enhancing tongue motor and sensory control (TMSC) in these variable patient populations. Although clinical trials show that steroids (NCT04151082) and gabapentin (NCT03747562) temporarily reduce pain, their adverse effects compromise tolerance and adherence. Thus, we need new treatments. The goal here was to strengthen networks that regulate TMSC through our individualized fMRI AI-NeuroModulation, termed iNM fMRI measures the magnitude and spatial extent of the ratio of oxygenated (O2) to deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb). Our non-invasive, precision-medicine AI-iNM intervention: (1) target primary motor and sensory areas in the brain that regulate swallowing with 1mm level precision, (2) targets each patient's unique anatomical motor and sensory extents , and (3) iNM is and are guided by reinforcing or inhibiting the HbO2 intensity and extent of each patient's unique brain network, as opposed to self-regulation of the HbO2 intensity. Methods: Thirty healthy subjects participated in a 2-day study which included iNM and control conditions. We first computed the individualized TMSC cortical selectivity to be targeted in the iNM condition. Support vector machine (SVM) classified cortical tongue direction and tongue-at-rest patterns generated via iNM and control. We quantified the BOLD magnitude for each network by computing the area under the curve (AUC), variance and association between brain states and TMSC responses via dynamic causal modeling (DCM). Results: The mechanisms associated with attention-memory and sensorimotor iNM are: 1. 45% increase in the AUC's BOLD magnitude (p<0.001); 2. 14% decrease in the BOLD's intensity variance (p<0.01); and 3. 20% increase in network expansion (p<0.001). DCM uncovered 97% of the trials as pure motor signal, while 3% were noise in the iNM condition (compared to 83% of the TMSC trials and 17% noise in the control condition): 1. 70% motor-to-motor (M1, motor cerebellum, basal ganglia) and 70% motor-to-sensory; 2. 69% sensory-to-sensory (intraparietal lobule, insula, claustrum, sensory cerebellum, ACC); and 3. 70% sensorimotor-to-attention-memory network connectivities.

The transition from well-fed to food-deprived conditions in C. elegans triggers a localized exploration of the environment characterized by frequent reorientations. However, over time the cumulative frequency of these reorientations decreases, facilitating the transition to global search behaviour. To investigate the genetic regulation of foraging in C. elegans, we conducted a screen of neuropeptide mutants and identified several candidates involved in modulating this behaviour. Among these, neuropeptide FLP-15 emerged as a key regulator of both local and global search behaviours. Our observations revealed that FLP-15 regulates the frequency and duration of reversals during foraging. Further investigation indicated that FLP-15 is expressed in and functions through the I2 pharyngeal neuron via the G-protein coupled receptor NPR-3. Mutants lacking either flp-15 or npr-3 displayed a significant decrease in reversal frequency during local search behaviours. Interestingly, unlike wild-type animals, the reversal frequency in flp-15 and npr-3 mutants did not decrease over time. This study also describes the expression pattern of NPR-3, in a subset of head neurons, predominantly comprising of dopaminergic neurons. This expression pattern highlights a potential link between neuropeptide signalling and dopaminergic modulation of behaviour. Finally, exogenous dopamine supplementation assays revealed that FLP-15 may regulate foraging by modulating dopamine transmission, highlighting a novel neuropeptide-dopamine interaction involved in the control of foraging behaviours.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Contrary to prevailing assumptions, we found that fire did not significantly shift ecological selection processes in bacteria or fungi but instead constrained dispersal, particularly reducing dispersal in bacterial and fungal communities, and increasing ecological drift in fungi. Despite limited evidence for ecological selection, fire consistently filtered for specialist taxa, increasing their relative abundance across microbial communities. Fire also reduced fungal diversity and evenness, while bacterial communities exhibited greater dominance and loss of rare taxa. These findings support the idea that fire promotes microbial post-fire niche specialization while disrupting dispersal pathways.

The efficacy of instaPRESERVE Tissuesafe with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol and a modified tissue processing method without alcohol dehydration steps was studied. The pig's organs, brain, and liver tissues were fixed with NBF and InstaPRESERVE Tissuesafe solutions (ethanol/isopropyl alcohol). Based on the alcohol content of instaPRESERVE Tissuesafe, the dehydration step(s) were skipped during tissue processing. Serial sections from fixed tissues were processed and stained with H&E. The intactness of the sections with instaPRESERVE Tissuesafe fixation was comparable to that of NBF fixation. No autolysis/ decomposition was observed with InstaPRESERVE Tissuesafe (both) and NBF. The H&E staining scoring was satisfactory with well-preserved cell boundaries and organelles in both liver and brain tissue sections.

Perturbing dyads' behavior or respiration revealed distinct causal effects: respiratory perturbations impaired both dyadic respiratory and behavioral synchrony, whereas auditory-motor perturbations disrupted only dyadic behavioral synchrony. Individual differences further shaped synchrony: partners who shared similar spontaneous rates achieved better behavioral synchrony, and partners with more similar resting heart rates exhibited stronger cardiac synchrony in joint production.

It was applied to patient-derived orthotopic clear cell renal cell carcinoma mouse models, at 1 cm3 volumes, providing clinically more relevant conditions than those of commonly used models. Gold nanorods (GNRs) with absorption tuned to the optical window and fixed irradiation conditions were employed. Therapy safety and efficacy were established using standard methods and pre-GNR injection, pre-therapy and post-therapy measurements obtained with the toolbox were analyzed to model therapy progression. Results revealed an association between tumor water concentration and accumulated GNR fraction in the tumor, a correlation between the pre-therapy tumor absorption coefficient and the maximum skin temperature reached, and a link between simulated treated volume estimates and progression-free survival, among other findings. These results demonstrate the capabilities of optical measurements to model the outcome and explain the mechanisms involved in the therapy, advancing towards a personalization strategy.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

K.; Yamauchi, T.; Buteau, A.; Hanson, S.; Dudman, J. T.; Felsen, G. K.; Stubblefield, E. A.", "abstract": "Orienting movements are a critical component of the natural behavioral repertoire, but their underlying neural bases are not well understood. The deep superior colliculus (dSC) integrates input from several brain regions that influence the selection of targets for orienting movements and coordinates activity among brainstem motor nuclei to initiate and execute movement. Evidence suggests that one prominent dSC input, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), permits movement by disinhibiting its targets, but much is unknown about the relationship between SNr activity, dSC activity, and movement. Building on increasing application of the head-fixed mouse model to elucidate the neural basis of behavior, we examined neural activity recorded in dSC and SNr with high-density probes in mice performing several variants of a sensorimotor orienting task, from our labs and in data sets curated by the International Brain Laboratory. We found that dSC and SNr were active preceding and throughout movement, across task variants, suggesting that they were engaged by the required movements. Prior to movement, SNr activity reflected the outcome of the previous trial, consistent with a role in biasing movements towards the highest value target. However, the dependence of dSC activity on movement direction was weaker than in other directional orienting behaviors, and we found little evidence for strong suppression of dSC by SNr. These results complement and extend previous findings from other orienting tasks and suggest diverse roles for modulatory input from SNr to dSC in shaping motor behavior.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders and one of the leading causes of death in individuals over the age of 65. Most cases of AD develop sporadically, however, there are several risk factors that have been identified which significantly increases an individual's risk for developing AD. The most prominent of these is Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), which can potentially result in an up to 10-fold greater risk of developing AD. The presence of APOE4 alone, however, cannot be solely responsible for AD as the disease may occur even in the absence of APOE4. Therefore, there must be other contributing factors such as exposure to environmental toxins including heavy metals and pesticides, which have independently been shown to contribute to AD. Nano- and microplastics (NMPs) are plastic particles less than 1 micrometers and 5 millimeters in size, respectively, and have only recently been identified as a major environmental pollutant with serious health concerns. Given the adverse health effects that are increasingly being associated with NMPs exposure, we sought to understand how the combination of APOE4 and NMPs exposure may work synergistically to promote cognitive dysfunction and alter key regulatory pathways to impact overall health. Following an acute (3 week) exposure to pristine spherical fluorescently-labeled 0.1 and 2 micrometer polystyrene (PS) NMPs, we found significant sex-dependent alterations in locomotor and recognition memory in APOE4 mice, but not in APOE3 controls. We additionally found that exposure to PS-NMPs resulted in sex and genotype specific alterations in astrocytic and microglial markers in the brain, and in CYP1A1, a major metabolizer of environmental polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in the liver. These results suggest PS-NMPs may interact with the APOE4 allele to promote cognitive dysfunction and alter immune and metabolic pathways which may contribute to disease-like states.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Seeking to localize this biogeographic break, we generated low coverage whole genome resequencing data for 120 Pacific herring from seven sites across the northern Gulf of Alaska and the eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. Single nucleotide polymorphisms across the mitogenome (267) and nuclear genome (~5.6 million) corroborate a biogeographic break in Pacific herring along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands, as far west as Unalaska. We identified two distinct populations: one exists along the northern coasts of the Aleutian Islands and in the eastern Bering Sea; the other occupies the southern edge of the Aleutians and the Gulf of Alaska. Two mitochondrial haplogroups co-occurring at collection sites across the Gulf of Alaska suggest secondary contact between two populations, likely representing glacial refugia.

Methods: We introduce NeuroMark-HiFi, a fully automated algorithm designed to enhance the detection of high-spatial-frequency functional brain network patterns. NeuroMark-HiFi systematically preserves and analyzes fine-grained network variations by integrating reference-informed independent component analysis (ICA), 3D high-frequency spatial filtering, and a frequency-informed ICA decomposition to extract high-frequency functional components with greater precision. Results: Simulation studies and mathematical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroMark-HiFi significantly improves sensitivity to both individual and group differences driven by small local shifts in spatial patterns of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Compared to traditional methods, NeuroMark-HiFi revealed additional group differences between individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC), particularly in the visual, sensorimotor, frontal, temporal, and insular networks. Conclusion: NeuroMark-HiFi successfully captures biologically meaningful alterations in spatial network patterns that conventional approaches may miss. Significance: By improving sensitivity to subtle brain network alterations, NeuroMark-HiFi holds promise for early diagnosis, treatment monitoring, neurodevelopment studies, aging research, and multimodal biomarker discovery, advancing the goals of precision psychiatry and neuroscience.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

WM voxels from each segment were masked by the thresholds of FA and mode of anisotropy. Encoded in T2W images (b-value = 0), an orientation-dependent R2 profile was constructed based on voxel-wise fiber orientations and characterized by a cone model. This allowed R2a, an orientation-dependent or anisotropic R2, to be separated from its orientation-independent or isotropic counterpart. Except for R2a, no discernible differences were found for the fits between the two b-values. On average, R2^a increased from 2.4{+/-}0.2 (1/s) to 3.2{+/-}0.3 (1/s) as the b-value increased. Furthermore, R2^a showed an increasing trend from CC1 to CC7 and the open angle alpha; of the cone fluctuated around 65{degrees}. As usual, FA was found increasing from CC1 to CC7 and from a higher to a lower b-value.

Here, we present a comprehensive network-based framework that constructs and integrates 119 time- and tissue-specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks derived from transcriptomic data, offering insights into proteomic dynamics across the human lifespan. Based on this, we observed three distinct protein groups: (i) common-core proteins, expressed universally across all tissues and time points; (ii) time-/tissue-specific proteins, selectively expressed within specific temporal or spatial contexts; and (iii) time-/tissue-unique proteins, whose expression is restricted to specific points in space and time. Our analysis shows a clear gradient of network centrality, transitioning from the highly connected common-core proteins to more specialized time-/tissue-specific and unique proteins, mirroring a progressive shift in functional specificity. Further, we characterized the distinct molecular signatures of intrauterine to extrauterine life, delineating two key protein networks: the embryonic development network (EDev) and the environmental aging network (EAgi). Their network characterization and comparison highlighted specific communities within the EDev network enriched for developmental diseases, and specific EAgi communities involved in aging.

In this study, we evaluated CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/Cas12a for gene knock-in at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in non-human primate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Delivering the nuclease as a protein alongside a custom DNA template, we optimized editing with Cas12a and demonstrated higher knock-in efficiency and fewer non-specific edits than Cas9.

For psychostimulants, the duration of abstinence strongly modulated the preference for control, without affecting the ability to maximize monetary payoffs.

Prior knowledge of pedigree and parental performance allows breeders to discern which crosses to prioritize, since the time to make crossing decisions and the space to evaluate tens and thousands of progenies are both limited resources in sugarcane variety development programs. In this project, we have developed a user-friendly, web-based platform called CaneCestry that provides a wide range of tools utilizing pedigree information.

While older adults generally show a preference of accuracy over speed, this is not always the case. The underlying factor behind this inconsistency may be motivational differences, with older participants compensating for a speed disadvantage with increased intrinsic motivation to perform well. We investigated this in a pre-registered study, using the Sustained aAttention to Response Task (SART) in young (n = 25, mean age = 19) and older adults (n = 25, mean age = 69.5). We matched participant accuracy by titrating response window length. Both groups achieved similar performance and strategy during the titration, enabling a comparison without confounds resulting from differences in default age-specific strategies. All participants were then monetarily encouraged to perform better in terms of accuracy. Both groups responded with an adaptive strategy of slowed reaction times and enhanced accuracy, but the young participants improved much more, outperforming older adults, and reversing the speed-accuracy strategies that are typically observed. In addition, older participants reported higher baseline levels of motivation alongside a reduced motivation to alter performance for money. So, while the older participants could match young participant performance in titration due to their higher baseline motivational levels, the young participants improved much more than older adults in response to the monetary incentive. From these findings we argue that older adults are intrinsically motivated to do well on tasks whereas younger age groups perform optimally only after incentivisation.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

The functional capacity of DAT is under the control of signaling inputs and post-translational modifications that confer acute presynaptic regulation of reuptake in response to physiological needs, and dysregulation of these processes may contribute to DA imbalances in mood disorders and drug addiction. A key modification of DAT is palmitoylation, a lipid adduction that enhances transport velocity, is suppressed by protein kinase C, and opposes protein kinase C-mediated down-regulation. Here we now show in rat striatum and heterologous cells that transporter palmitoylation is also linked to methamphetamine (METH), undergoing rapid and transient reductions in response to the drug. The time course and other characteristics of palmitoylation reduction parallel those of METH-induced transport down-regulation, and a palmitoylation-deficient DAT mutant shows enhanced down-regulation to METH, supporting a mechanistic link between reduction of the modification and reduced reuptake activity. Recovery rates differed, however, with palmitoylation returning to starting levels more rapidly than reuptake, indicating that down-regulation mechanisms remain engaged with transporters that have undergone repalmitoylation. These results support palmitoylation as a rapid response mechanism that modulates DAT entry into METH-induced down-regulation states and suggest a broader role for the modification in control of reuptake in additional physiological and pathophysiological conditions.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

SPION are preferentially taken up by perivascular, meningeal, and choroid plexus macrophages. In non-infected macaques, SPION+ macrophages can traffic out of the CNS to the periphery (deep cervical lymph node (dcLN), spleen, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG)), but accumulate in the CNS with SIV infection. ART reduces the accumulation of CNS SPION+ perivascular macrophages but not meningeal or choroid plexus macrophages.  ART interruption does not affect the number of SPION+ perivascular and choroid plexus but the number of SPION+ meningeal macrophages increase. ART eliminates SIV-RNA perivascular macrophages, but few scattered RNA+ macrophages in the meninges and choroid plexus remain. With ART interruption, perivascular macrophages remain SIV- but scattered SIV+ meningeal and choroid plexus macrophages exist. In non-infected animals SPION+ macrophages traffic to dcLN, spleen, and DRG at a rate that is decreased with SIV infection and AIDS.

However, this criticism does not apply to distance-based concatenation trees, which can be shown to be statistically consistent even in anomaly zones. Building on this insight, we introduce DIST (Distance-based Inference of Species Trees), an intuitive and scalable method that infers species trees from population-level distance matrices containing multi-locus estimates of Dxy, Fst or coalescence units. DIST derives these values from between-individual sequence dissimilarity estimates, E(p), using basic equations from coalescence theory. Under certain conditions, DIST can also quantify gene tree discordance and distinguish whether it arises from gene flow or incomplete lineage sorting alone. While conceptually related to more sophisticated summary methods, DIST differs in that it does not seek the species tree which best explains a set of gene trees. Instead, it searches for the species tree which best explains an average gene tree, of which all branch lengths reflect mean coalescence time, E(t). Although this average gene tree is rarely observed empirically, it is approximated by an individual-level distance-based tree, traditionally referred to as a \"tree of individuals\".

Our framework includes novel quality control procedures, scalable gene selection strategies especially for spatially variable genes, and optimized normalization and dimensionality reduction techniques based on in-depth statistical characterization of spatial data. We also demonstrate how single-cell annotation tools can be leveraged for automated cell-type labeling within spatial contexts.

This curve emerges from two converging resonance states - homeostatic and circadian - that form a stable framework across conditions. Their relative phase and amplitude determine REM structure, producing bell-shaped, linear, or bimodal profiles. The model reproduces REM dynamics during regular sleep, extension, and post-deprivation recovery. Crucially, REM duration alone provides an experimentally accessible readout: simultaneously revealing circadian phase and quantifying sleep deficit as additional hours needed to restore homeostatic equilibrium.

C.; Choi, I. B.; Matsumura, K.; Nicot, A.; Cox, S.; Dobbs, L. K.", "abstract": "Rationale: Human self-report data and rodent models indicate cocaine can induce negative affect, which may impact future cocaine use severity. Despite this, understanding of the neurobiology driving cocaine avoidance is limited. Within the striatum, the opioid peptides enkephalin and dynorphin are associated with cocaine reward and aversion, respectively. Additionally, striatal dynorphin signaling resulting from stress or cocaine withdrawal acts as a negative reinforcer to increase cocaine seeking. Objectives: We validated the use of the cocaine self-administration runway in mice to measure the development of cocaine avoidance and tested whether mice with higher relative striatal dynorphin-to-enkephalin expression are resistant to developing cocaine avoidance. Methods: Cocaine avoidance in the self-administration runway was measured in two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, known to have opposite striatal dynorphin/enkephalin milieus, and in mice lacking enkephalin selectively from striatal medium spiny neurons (D2-PenkKO). Results: Both inbred strains developed cocaine avoidance, though they expressed it differently. Across training, DBA/2J mice increased their latency to self-administer cocaine, and C57BL/6J increased the number of retreats away from the cocaine-paired goal box. D2-PenkKOs developed similar cocaine avoidance compared to littermate controls. Conclusions: Mice develop avoidance to self-administer cocaine in the runway across a range of strains. Pre-existing strain differences in the striatal dynorphin/enkephalin milieu, however, do not appear to alter the development of cocaine avoidance, and striatal enkephalin is not necessary for the development of cocaine avoidance. This suggests higher relative striatal dynorphin does not facilitate cocaine seeking by mitigating cocaine avoidance.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

While its role in adaptive immunity is well defined, its potential to contribute directly to innate immune activation and remains incompletely understood. Neutrophils, in particular, are prominent effectors in COVID-19 severity, yet how they respond directly to the S protein presented in a multivalent format is unclear. Here, we investigated whether the S protein can directly activate human neutrophils ex vivo using two biologically relevant models: nanoparticles displaying multivalent stabilized prefusion trimeric S glycoprotein, and purified beta-propiolactone-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions. Neutrophils were exposed to nanoparticles or inactivated virus, either alone or pre-coated with monoclonal or polyclonal anti-S antibodies. Nanoparticles displaying Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Fusion (F) protein and purified {beta}-propiolactone-inactivated RSV served as comparators. Across all models and conditions tested, the S protein did not induce significant neutrophil responses. No consistent effects were observed on cell viability, surface marker expression, reactive oxygen species production, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, cytokine release, or inflammatory gene expression, even in the presence of anti-S antibodies mimicking immune complexes. Results with F-nanoparticles and inactivated RSV were similarly modest. These findings indicate that the trimeric prefusion S protein, whether displayed multivalently on nanoparticles or in the context of inactivated viral particles, is insufficient to trigger robust neutrophil activation. This work provides insight into the innate immune profile of the S protein and suggests that its use in vaccine platforms is unlikely to directly provoke neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Among various interventions to slow the aging process, caloric restriction (CR) has consistently demonstrated the ability to extend lifespan and enhance brain function across different species. Yet the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms by which CR benefits the aging brain remain elusive, especially at region-specific and cell type-specific resolution. In this study, we performed spatiotemporal profiling of mouse brains to elucidate the detailed mechanisms driving the anti-aging effects of CR. Utilizing highly scalable single-nucleus genomics and spatial transcriptomics platforms, EasySci and IRISeq, we profiled over 500,000 cells from 36 mouse brains across three age groups and conducted spatial transcriptomic analysis on twelve brain sections from aged mice under CR and control conditions. This comprehensive approach allowed us to explore the impact of CR on over 300 cellular states and assess region-specific molecular alterations. Our findings reveal that CR effectively modulates key aging-associated changes, notably by delaying the expansion of inflammatory cell populations and preserving cells critical to the neurovascular system and myelination pathways. Moreover, CR significantly reduced the expression of aging-associated genes involved in oxidative stress, unfolded protein stress, and DNA damage stress across various cell types and regions. A notable reduction in senescence-associated genes and restoration of circadian rhythm genes were observed, particularly in ventricles and white matter. Furthermore, CR exhibited region-specific restoration in genes linked to cognitive function and myelin maintenance, underscoring its targeted effects on brain aging. In summary, the integration of single-nucleus and spatial genomics provides a novel framework for understanding the complex effects of anti-aging interventions at the cellular and molecular levels, offering potential therapeutic targets for aging and neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

These interactions, mediated by cell membrane receptors called integrins, involve bidirectional signaling between the intracellular actin cytoskeleton and the ECM. Integrins bind with cytoplasmic proteins to form adhesion complexes of varying sizes and maturity, which play crucial roles in cellular processes such as cell migration. Among these complexes are nascent adhesions--the smallest and earliest observable structures that emerge within the lamellipodium and are associated with rapid cell motility. While other adhesion types have been extensively studied, the mechanisms regulating nascent adhesions remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a mathematical model describing the bidirectional signaling between the actin cytoskeleton and ECM that controls nascent adhesion dynamics. Our framework employs a system of delay differential equations to capture the temporal coupling between actin polymerization-driven adhesion formation and force-dependent ECM displacement. The model demonstrates that nascent adhesions, initiated by actin polymerization, exert forces on the ECM, whose delayed displacement provides negative feedback that limits adhesion growth. Numerical simulations reveal that this delayed ECM feedback mechanism reproduces the characteristic lifetime and dynamics of nascent adhesions, with quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Our results suggest that delayed ECM negative feedback is a key regulator of nascent adhesion turnover, providing new insights into the spatiotemporal control of cell migration.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

We show that long-term treatment with Adropin reversed multiple markers of HFpEF-related cardiac dysfunction (including fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy). Using untargeted metabolomics, we found that Adropin treatment restricted deleterious metabolite entry into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, leading to a reduction in the inhibitory O-GlcNAcylation of the cardiac fatty acid oxidation enzyme long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.

Leveraging bulk and single-cell B cell receptor repertoires, single-cell transcriptomics, and immunophenotyping, we uncover paradigm-shifting insights into CSR. Newly activated B cells produce sterile transcripts of all antibody isotype constant regions (IGHC) simultaneously up to IGHG2, challenging the view that sterile transcription occurs for only a single IGHC gene at a time. CSR follows a multistep progression along the IGHC locus; in this challenge vaccine-induced B cells switch from IGHM to IGHG3 and IGHG1, followed by a subsequent switching to IGHA1 and IGHG2 after secondary immunization. IGHA2 clones require pre-switching to IGHA1 clones. Notably, switching tendency, measured by IGHC sterile transcription, is memory B cell subtype dependent, particularly beyond IGHG2. Contrary to other vaccines, antigen-specific B cells are enriched in DN2, Cmem2 and DN4 subtypes after immunization. We also observe a temporal decoupling of CSR and somatic hypermutation (SHM), with the latter detectable only after six months post-immunization.

Single cell and bulk transcriptomic patterns revealed that HIV infection induces a pattern of cellular senescence, with strong parallels to the transcriptomic signature of normal aging. Both processes were characterized by p53 pathway activation, upregulation of inflammatory genes and downregulation of proliferative genes while maintaining mTOR signaling, a pattern characteristic of cellular senescence. Importantly, both actively HIV infected and bystander microglia showed the cellular senescence patterns. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for the observed premature brain aging in HAND, and identify senescence-associated pathways as potential therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

M.; Maqbool, A.; Le, T. B. K.", "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved a wide array of immune systems to detect and defend against external threats including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as bacteriophages, plasmids, and transposons. MGEs are often selfish, exploiting their bacterial hosts to propagate, however they can also provide adaptive advantages through horizontal gene transfer. Gene transfer agents (GTAs), which are non-infectious domesticated prophages, represent a unique class of beneficial MGEs that facilitate bacterial gene transfer. Despite their domestication, GTAs retain phage-like features, including the requirement for host cell lysis to release particles, that may inadvertently trigger host immunity. How GTAs might avoid, subvert, or possibly adopt host immune systems to complete their life stages is poorly understood. Here, we identify a tripartite system, LypABC, that is essential for GTA-mediated cell lysis in Caulobacter crescentus. LypABC resembles caspase recruitment domain-nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (CARD-NLR) anti-phage defence systems that mediate abortive infection wherein infected cells die to prevent phage proliferation, thereby protecting the overall bacterial population. LypABC-deficient cells produce host DNA-packed GTA particles and eventually die but cannot lyse to release GTA particles. Moreover, overproduction of LypABC is highly toxic to both GTA-producing and non-producing cells, highlighting the need for strict regulation. We find that such regulation is achieved transcriptionally by a repressor, RogB, which binds the promoters of lypABC and of essential GTA activator genes, thus coupling GTA activation and host cell lysis. While traditionally considered antagonistic towards MGEs, our findings here suggest that immunity components are versatile and can be adapted to support MGEs.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

By leveraging a time-aware Transformer architecture, MicroProphet reconstructs individualized microbial trajectories using as little as the initial 30% of time points, capturing critical transitional states through its attention mechanism. We demonstrate its robust cross-ecosystem generalizability across synthetic communities, human gut microbiomes, infant gut development, and corpse decomposition. In clinical contexts, MicroProphet enables early identification of disease-related microbial shifts and supports intervention timing optimization, exemplified in inflammatory bowel disease and antibiotic perturbation responses.

We have previously shown that the latent HSV-1 genome contains CTCF insulators that function to regulate lytic transcription of adjacent genes in a one-dimensional manner. Here, we test the hypothesis that HSV-1 CTCF insulators nucleate chromatin loops to regulate the expression of distance separated gene regions through three-dimensional organization of viral genomes. We used 4C-seq methods to identify multiple long-range cis interactions in HSV-1 genomes that generate viral chromatin domains, including those nucleated by the viral CTCF insulator CTRL2. Deletion of the CTRL2 insulator disrupted these viral chromatin domains. Loop-nucleating interactions were quantitated with a novel approach (UMI-4C-seq) that utilizes unique molecular identifiers to label and count chromatin interactions associated with specific viewpoint primers. Cis-interaction peaks across four different viewpoints were quantified. Viral genomes lacking CTRL2 displayed more cis-interaction peaks and wider ranges of interaction lengths compared to wt virus, suggesting altered chromatin organization. Furthermore, differential looping analysis showed viral genomes lacking CTRL2 displayed a more transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment. Thus, the CTRL2 insulator functions as a critical regulator of long-range chromatin interactions and its deletion reshapes the viral chromatin landscape, leading to a more accessible and dynamic regulatory environment that may influence HSV-1 transcriptional programs and latency-associated chromatin states.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Totiviruses and their satellites coexist but with an asymmetric dependence on the totivirus for maintenance inside the host cell. Satellites provide their yeast hosts with inhibitory toxins and the necessary self-immunity; loss of the satellite equates to loss of immunity. Because mycoviruses lack known extracellular stages, and sex is considered rare, mycoviruses are assumed to be transmitted vertically, implying infection states should correlate with host genotypes. However, totivirus-satellite coinfections are rarely examined in natural populations, leaving their associations with host genotypes poorly understood. We screened a multiyear population of S. cerevisiae isolates from New Zealand to examine the stability of host-virus associations over time, both within and across genotypes. While 55% of wild isolates harbored infections, only 37% of these included toxin-encoding satellites. Genotypes that persisted across years typically maintained consistent infection states. However, we observed stepwise transitions including acquisitions of totiviruses and satellites. Genotypes clustered strongly by infection state, supporting vertical transmission while suggesting that outcrossing is not responsible for the mycovirus acquisitions. Despite infection changes, genotype clustering by infection state remained intact, suggesting transitions are transient and that host genotypes may have optimal totivirus-satellite infection states.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

While forensic practitioners frequently incorporate supplementary evidence (SE), such as age, biological sex, or phenotypic traits, in these cases, this integration typically occurs informally, without rigorous probability estimation, compromising procedural transparency and reliability. Here, we present a comprehensive methodological framework that formally synthesizes forensic DNA evidence (FDE) with SE through innovative Markov chain models and customized transition matrices designed for various biological traits. This approach generates combined likelihood assessments expressed as LRs or posterior probabilities.

However, the neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning this dynamic adjustment to exogenous uncertainty fluctuations remain unexplored. Combining interpersonal tasks simulating exogenous uncertainty-to-certainty transitions with one fMRI experiment applying multivariate pattern analyses and three behavioral experiments, we uncover an adaptive asymmetric adjustment in the beneficiary's affective evaluation and reciprocity in response to altruistic behaviors: the beneficiary's gratitude and ensuing reciprocity intensify when the final benefactor-cost (or self-benefit) exceeds the expectation under exogenous uncertainty; however, a parallel reduction in benefactor-cost (or self-benefit) does not elicit equivalent decreases. This asymmetric adjustment, perceived as morally superior by third parties, challenges classical theories of gratitude, decision-making, and social learning involving uncertainty. We resolve this paradox by proposing a mechanism of prosocial information integration: guided by the adaptive goal (e.g., gathering social acceptance), the beneficiary tends to asymmetrically weigh prior information (e.g., the cost the benefactor willing to undertake under uncertainty) against posterior information (e.g., final benefactor's cost) when evaluating benefactor's intention, contributing to the observed adaptive asymmetry in gratitude and reciprocity dynamics. This process is supported by neural representations within the theory-of-mind system, particularly the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. By reframing direct reciprocity as a dynamic process shaped by prosocial information integration, this work extends the theoretical framework of cooperation under uncertainty, offering new insights into human social adaptation.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Infections by P. jirovecii are treated using the antifolate combination drug trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), targeting the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). In recent years, there has been an increase of treatment failure, with no mutations observed in the DHPS, implying the potential evolution of resistance through this pathogen's DHFR (PjDHFR). Experimental methods to study this pathogen are limited, as it cannot be grown in vitro. Model fungi are insensitive to TMP-SMX due to unknown mechanisms, preventing the use of functional complementation to study mutations causing resistance to this specific drug combination. In a previous study, we conducted deep mutational scanning (DMS) on PjDHFR to identify resistance mutations to methotrexate (MTX), another antifolate drug. Here, by leveraging this data, as well as computational data modeling aspects of protein function and stability in the PjDHFR-MTX complex, we train a machine learning model to predict the effect of mutations on MTX resistance. We find that the model can predict the effect of mutations outside of its training dataset (balanced accuracy on training set: 98.3%, and 88.3% on testing set). We also find that the best predictors of resistance, such as distance to ligand and effect on region flexibility, are coherent with previously established models, and that experimental data about the effect of mutations on protein function is critical to optimize model performance. Using this model on computational data generated using the PjDHFR-TMP complex, we predict the effect of mutations on resistance to TMP. We predict TMP resistance mutations in PjDHFR that did not confer resistance to MTX, one of which had been characterized in vitro as reducing affinity to TMP by 100-folds.

In addition, its neuroprotective effects were assessed in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells exposed to conditioned media (CM+) derived from the activated immune cells. FGA139 exhibited a favorable safety profile and robust anti-inflammatory activity, significantly reducing nitric oxide (NO) production in macrophages and TNF levels in microglia. Conditioned media from both LPS-stimulated immune cells lines (CM+) reduced neurite length in neuronal cells. However, CM+; from HMC3 cells impaired neuronal viability, whereas CM+; from RAW264.7 cells elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO levels, indicating distinct neurotoxic signatures. Preincubation of neuron-like cells with FGA139 effectively mitigated most of these adverse effects. Metabolomic analysis of the activated microglia supernatant revealed that FGA139 increased extracellular levels of neuroprotective metabolites, including purines, linoleic acid, and phenyllactic acid.

In this study, we identify the small GTPase Rab32 as being highly and selectively over-expressed in cDC1s as compared to cDC2s.

To address this gap, we compared whole-genome sequences from 45 environmental isolates--primarily collected on Hawai`i Island--with a globally sourced set of clinical isolates retrieved from NCBI RefSeq. Our phylogenetic reconstruction delineated environmental and clinical lineages, and pangenome profiling revealed a conserved core genome of approximately 4,800 genes alongside a large accessory genome. Crucially, we found 20 genes conserved in clinical isolates, but not environmental isolates. Clinical isolates were found to have conserved genes coding for erm(41), three transcriptional regulators, a pilus synthesis gene, an NADP-dependent oxidoreductase, a carbonic anhydrase, a probable L-ectoine synthase, a ribonuclease P protein component, and 11 hypothetical genes, whereas environmental isolated did not conserve any of these genes.

This is illustrated by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an oncogenic gamma-herpesvirus that overcomes host immune suppression by multiple mechanisms. In this study, we reported that KSHV dysregulates 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification and mRNA stability of host antiviral factors to benefit its lytic replication. KSHV lytic reactivation or de novo challenge led to downregulation of m5C RNA methyltransferases, NSUN2 and NSUN1 (NSUN2/1), while NSUN2/1 depletion promoted KSHV lytic replication. Such KSHV-mediated downregulation of NSUN2/1 is via suppression of the transcriptional factor c-Myc. We further performed the RNA bisulfite sequencing (RNA-BS-seq) to identify KSHV-dependent m5C modification of host mRNAs. KSHV lytic reactivation led to the significant reduction of m5C methylation and mRNA stability of TRIM25, a key activator of the RIG-I pathway, while TRIM25 depletion indeed promoted KSHV lytic replication. These host-virus interaction events were also observed in the infection of another oncogenic gamma-herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

However, parasites can arrest their cell cycle when treated with the frontline antimalarial drug artemisinin, and artemisinin-resistant parasites can modulate their cell-cycle progression, so it is very important to understand these aspects of Plasmodium biology. Here, we show that P. falciparum displays hallmarks of an intra-S-phase checkpoint when exposed to DNA damage, including acute reduction of DNA replication and phosphorylation of a putative damage-marker histone. Compounds that inhibit human checkpoint kinases can inhibit this arrest of DNA replication, and synergise with DNA damage in parasite killing. This suggests the existence of checkpoint kinase activity in P. falciparum, yet these kinases have no clear homologues in Plasmodium genomes. We hypothesise that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase - an essential lipid kinase - may moonlight in this role: it is the closest homologue to a checkpoint kinase and is reportedly up-regulated in artemisinin-resistant parasites. Finally, we show that the cryptic checkpoint-kinase activity may also regulate the ring-stage survival phenotype after artemisinin damage, which resembles a G1/S checkpoint. Hence we suggest that checkpoint kinase inhibitors are candidates for synergy with artemisinin.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

The production of glycopeptidolipids (GPL) is a major determinant of virulence of this bacterium, with clinical isolates that lack GPL generally exhibiting more aggressive clinical behavior. The current paradigm is that GPL production is abolished in vivo via irreversible, spontaneous mutations taking place as part of in-host evolution. Little is known about the mechanisms or extent to which GPL production may be regulated. Here we describe an unusual TetR-like transcription factor of M. abscessus, MAB_1638, that appears to be a strong positive regulator of the entire GPL biosynthesis and export gene cluster through a combination of direct and indirect mechanisms. The inactivation of mab_1638 abolished GPL production and thus led to stable rough colony morphology, as well as increased virulence in infection models, characteristic of rough, non-GPL-producers. Transcriptome analysis found the mab_1638 mutant had 118 differentially expressed genes, including the GPL locus and a second, recently described GPL-like locus that produces a related glycosylated lipopeptide called GP8L. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and sequencing revealed a consensus inverted-repeat DNA sequence motif characteristic of genes regulated by mab_1638. Together, mab_1638 appears to encode a transcription factor required for production of GPL and therefore having a profound effect on virulence traits. We propose naming this gene GPL regulator 1 (gplR1). This finding raises the important possibility that M. abscessus strains appearing smooth in laboratory growth conditions may nonetheless downregulate GPL-cluster genes in other conditions, including in-patient conditions, and thus acquire the phenotypic characteristics of rough strains.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

FPM13 was serendipitously identified during purification of Francisella type VI secretion system (T6SS) effector proteins, co-purifying with them. Its identity, initially unknown, was established using the novel cryoID method. The structure reveals a symmetrical, donut-shaped 18-mer with 9-fold dihedral symmetry, formed by two stacked nonamers head-to-head. It measures ~8 nm both in height and in outer diameter, and has a 3.5 nm central channel. The complex features a double-layered wall with an inner {beta}-sheet core and an outer -helical shell. Each monomer adopts a compact fold comprising an N-terminus {beta}-strand, an -helix and two additional {beta} strands at the C-terminus. The assembly is stabilized by inter-ring loop interactions and hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts between neighboring subunits. Biochemical analyses, as shown by APEX-biotinylation and Triton X-114 phase partitioning, confirmed that FPM13 is a soluble periplasmic protein. ICP-MS demonstrated that FPM13 binds iron and copper. Deletion of FPM13 in Francisella novicida strains caused no growth defects in macrophages or mice but show increased copper sensitivity under iron-depleted conditions, suggesting a role for FPM13 in metal transport or detoxification.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

We mapped the genomic data and electronic health records from 13k individuals in the Integrative Genomics Biorepository cohort, to neighborhood-level geographic data and integrated census-based environmental metrics. We used an identity-by-descent (IBD) based hierarchical community detection algorithm to identify four main communities closely aligning with continental ancestry, and seventeen subcommunities. We found uneven exposure to elevated environmental stressors across subcommunities, and we were able to identify subcommuinities at high risk of respiratory and dermatological conditions, demonstrating the potential of our framework and its possible application to public health interventions. Interestingly, for conditions such as congenital disorders, the most important differences were detected between subcommunities within the same community, indicating the relevance of considering a fine-grained population structure.

EPFs occur in most bird species that have been examined, but sexual conflict will generally reward females hiding their EPCs from males attempting to protect their paternity. EPCs will be difficult for researchers to document, and necessarily underestimated, in that case. We measured EPC behaviors and EPF frequency in a colonial seabird, the Nazca booby Sula granti, in which all copulations occur in a visually open setting with numerous possible copulatory partners readily available. Females are larger and more physically powerful than males, and are the numerically limiting sex, perhaps limiting options for males to control females. We found that all copulations were voluntary, and females sexual activities were wholly unconstrained by male coercion. Most females had multiple copulatory partners in the weeks preceding egg-laying. Despite the commonness of EPC, EPFs did not occur. The different schedules of EPC and within-pair copulation (WPC) provided a sufficient explanation for this outcome: during the ovulation window days before laying, WPC rate increased and EPC rate approached zero. To our knowledge, this is the first robust evidence of complete sexual agency in a female bird aside from lek-mating species, contributing a valuable exemplar to the literature on sexual conflict over reproduction.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

For decades, it has been appreciated that many FOGDDs require ascorbate (Vitamin C) as a cofactor for efficient catalysis, but ascorbate requirements across different FOGDD enzymes, its effects on the catalysis of different substrates, and how it engages the FOGDD active site, remain poorly understood. Here, we use RNA demethylases FTO and AlkBH5 as model FOGDD enzymes and show that their ascorbate requirements for efficient demethylation reactions are dramatically different. Furthermore, FTO was found to have strikingly different ascorbate requirements for its own demethylation reactions with different methylated RNA substrates. Our enzymology experiments suggest FTO and AlkBH5, and likely FOGDDs generally, can have widely different ascorbate dependencies based on the balance between an enzyme's intrinsic ability to decarboxylate co-substrate 2-oxoglutarate and the kinetics of its substrate oxidation reaction. Finally, we determined a crystal structure of FTO in complex with ascorbate, which for the first time shows how ascorbate selectively engages the FOGDD active site. Together, our biochemical and structural data show that ascorbate can selectively tune the RNA demethylation reactions of FTO and AlkBH5, and that more globally, differences in ascorbate concentrations in different environments or diseases may regulate the activity and specificity of diverse FOGDD-catalyzed oxidation reactions in the cell.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Aging-associated changes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), including inflammation and increased myelopoiesis, are implicated in both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, but their contributions to CVD-driven tumor progression are unclear. Objectives: To study cancer growth following peripheral ischemia and consequent changes within the HSPC bone marrow compartment to uncover mechanisms through which altered hematopoiesis promotes oncogenesis. Methods: Mammary cancer cell (E0771) growth was monitored in C57BL/6J mice after hind limb ischemia (HLI) or sham surgery. The tumor immune microenvironment, circulatory immune cells, and HSPC compartment were assessed by flow cytometry. Next-generation single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing of HSPCs was performed to assess transcriptomic and epigenetic changes. The functional impact on tumor progression and persistence of ischemia-induced epigenetic reprogramming of HSPCs and their myeloid progeny was examined by bone marrow transplantation. Results: Peripheral ischemia increased monocyte and neutrophil output at the expense of lymphocytes, driven by a shift toward CD150hi myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This was associated with accelerated breast cancer growth and increased accumulation of tumoral immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and monocytes. Increased myelopoiesis was also supported by multiomic analyses showing HLI-induced transcriptional and epigenetic enrichment for inflammatory (NLRP3 inflammasome) and aging-associated (Neogenin-1, Thrombospondin-1) signatures in subsets of monocyte/dendritic progenitors. HLI-accelerated tumor growth and myeloid-skewing was transmissible via bone marrow transplantation, indicating long-term reprogramming of innate immune responses.

N.; Borges da Silva, H.", "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and, despite treatment advances, immune suppression remains an obstacle to effective therapy. Effector CD4+ T cells (CD4+ Teffs) are critical for antitumor immunity, but their function is often inhibited by regulatory T cells (Tregs), which accumulate in lung tumors and perform suppressive functions through multiple mechanisms. This suppression leads to tumor progression and poor patient outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg-mediated suppression are not fully understood. Here, we identify the extracellular ATP receptor P2RX7 as a key regulator of Treg function in lung tumors. Using a murine lung cancer model induced by Lewis lung carcinoma cells, we demonstrate that P2RX7 enhances the suppressive capacity of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, promoting tumor growth. In T cell-specific P2RX7-KO mice, reduced Treg infiltration was accompanied by increased CD4+ Teff accumulation and improved tumor control. Treg-specific P2RX7-KO mice exhibit reduced tumor growth, confirming a cell-intrinsic role of P2RX7 in Tregs. Suppression assays revealed that tumor-infiltrating WT Tregs have greater suppressive activity compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs, which failed to inhibit type 1 and Tfh-like responses. This was associated with increased tumor-specific IgG production by lung B cells in P2RX7-KO mice. We also observed that WT Tregs express higher levels of the immunosuppressive surface molecule CTLA-4 when compared to P2RX7-KO Tregs. In summary, we show that P2RX7 expression on Tregs is essential for their suppressive function in lung cancer, and targeting of P2RX7 may constitute a novel strategy to improve lung cancer treatment by alleviating Treg-mediated immune suppression.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Our findings indicate that housing strategy significantly impacts gut microbiome diversity in adult fish with the highest similarity between individuals co-housed on recirculating water systems. Microbiome acclimation after housing transfer took between 14- and 21-days. Significant variation in microbiome composition was also observed across sampling sites. As in humans, fecal and intestinal microbial communities were similar and varied by sex, however each body site sampled possessed a small site-specific microbial community signature. Consistently, imputed function of these communities showed that gene family diversity is also predicted to vary by body site particularly between gut and non-gut locations.

Posaconazole was studied as a treatment option after the increase in mucormycosis cases linked to COVID-19, and promising results were obtained. However, despite its effectiveness, researchers are looking into new approaches to drug delivery due to problems including restricted bioavailability and short half-life. To address these issues, this project intends to create and synthesize posaconazole-containing liposomes. Methods In this study, according to the synthesis of Posaconazole-loaded liposomes, their physical and chemical properties were assessed using SEM, DLS, and FTIR techniques. The drug loading capacity in the nanoparticles, its release in vitro, and the antifungal activity against mucormycosis-causing fungi were evaluated. Finally, the cytotoxicity of these nanoparticles was assessed using the MTT Assay. Results The synthesized nanoparticles were spherical with an average size of approximately 60 nm. The drug loading efficiency was found to be 78.41%. The results indicated that the posaconazole nanoparticles demonstrated a slow and continuous drug release over five days. These nanoparticles demonstrated higher efficacy than posaconazole individually in antifungal tests. Additionally, cytotoxicity tests revealed that, up to a 400 microgram per milliliter concentration, posaconazole-loaded nanoparticles were less toxic than free posaconazole.

Apart from technical challenges such as the sparsity and heterogeneous noise properties of these data, the crucial problem is that we know little about the potentially very complex high-dimensional structures that the data represent. Consequently, there is an urgent need for exploratory analysis methods that allow rigorous representation and visualization of the structure in the data. However, currently popular methods such as UMAP and t-SNE are unsatisfactory because they are ad hoc, stochastic, uninterpretable, and known to severely distort the structure in the data. Here we show that these challenges can be overcome by representing the data on tree structures and present Bonsai: a novel method that reconstructs the most likely tree relating any set of high-dimensional objects while rigorously accounting for heterogeneous measurement noise. We show that, in contrast to other visualization methods, distances along the Bonsai trees accurately represent true distances between the objects in high-dimensional space across many types of datasets. Moreover, Bonsai automatically regularizes measurement noise, outperforming even methods specifically designed for that purpose on tasks such as nearest-neighbor identification. By analyzing a blood cell dataset, we show that Bonsai trees not only capture known lineage relationships but also provide novel biological insights. For example, Bonsai uncovers that different subsets of NK cells derive from the myeloid and lymphoid lineage, and pinpoints genes that distinguish myeloid-NK from lymphoid-NK cells. Bonsai is free from tunable parameters and scales to datasets of hundreds of thousands of cells. The accompanying tool, Bonsai-scout, provides visualizations of the Bonsai trees and allows for interactive data exploration such as identifying subclades and their markers, visualizing features along the tree, changing the tree layout, and zooming in on substructures. Finally, application to a dataset of football statistics shows the generality of Bonsai in successfully capturing complex structures in high-dimensional data.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Unlike a habit that is formally defined as insensitive to reward value, such persistency in choice can still be shaped and executed in a goal-directed manner, which underlies many volitional behaviors in animals. Yet, largely due to the absence of an established procedure that accesses non-habitual but persistent patterns of choice in animal models, empirical findings that identify its neural substrates are lacking. Using a cost-benefit conflicting decision paradigm in rodents, we here introduce an experimental procedure involving extensive decision opportunities in a fixed contingency, whereby mice acquire a recurrent pattern of choice and shape it into a fixed schema of goal-directed action to guide behavior. A subsequent functional screening of neural circuitry by chemogenetic inhibition reveals the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as a candidate for this form of choice. Notably, we found that OFC plays a specific role in embedding the recurrent choice pattern into the fixed schema for action selection, but not in merely defining conflicting choice. Consistently, we uncover that OFC ablation leaves animals' ability intact to make a conflicting choice, but selectively disrupts the formation of the fixed action schema. These findings suggest that OFC is crucial to ensure persistency in action selection by solidifying extensive history of recurrent choices into a firmly established schema of action selection, providing novel insights into how the stability and persistency of behavior are held in the brain.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

This study bridges these perspectives by establishing a new neuronal taxonomy, analyzing the connectomes of defined cortical cell types, and comparing them with those obtained from bulk anterograde injections. Neurons were sparsely labeled via tamoxifen-inducible Cre lines with GFP reporters, and 1,419 WNM cells were comprehensively reconstructed with Vaa3D-TeraVR from ~15 areas across six functional regions of molecularly labeled brains imaged with 2p-fMOST. These cells were newly classified by integrating current molecular-WNM and classical morphological perspectives, with sample size augmented by 1,455 publicly available WNM cells reconstructed from the Mouse-Light project and CEBSIT. This effort defined ten combined molecular-WNM-classical morphological cell types: L5ET_TPC, L6CT_NPC, L6b_HPC, and seven IT types including L2/3IT_TPC, L4IT_SSC, L4IT_UPC, L4IT_TPC, L5IT_SPC, L6IT_IPC, and L6IT_car3PC.

We show that PTEN, the primary negative regulator of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway that is highly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, regulates SAC morphology in a cell-autonomous manner. Pten-deficient SACs show a nearly twofold increase in the number of dendritic branches, while other morphological properties remain largely unchanged. These morphological changes arise late in SAC development after dendrite development is largely complete and persist into adulthood. Mechanistically, excessive dendritic branching appears to arise from dysregulated mTOR activity. Despite this dramatic increase in dendritic branches, Pten-deficient SACs maintain a normal population number, organization of synaptic outputs, and intact direction-selectivity in the retina. Collectively, these results show that PTEN is essential for the normal development of highly stereotyped neuronal morphology.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

B.; Giuffrida, V.; Ramawat, S.; Bardella, G.; Ferraina, S.; Brunamonti, E.", "abstract": "Flexible behaviour requires decision-making that integrates both perceptual and mnemonic-related information. While the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) is known to support decision-making based on perceptual computations, its contributions to decisions based on mnemonic information for motor planning are underexplored. Here, investigating local field potential (LFP) oscillations in PMd of monkeys performing a transitive inference task required the formation and retrieval of mnemonic representations of an arbitrarily defined rank order among perceptual items. Our results highlight that a dynamic interplay between lower frequencies (Theta, Alpha, Beta) and high-Gamma oscillatory activity of LFP reflects a mechanism for accessing and manipulating memory-related information underlying decision-making. These findings provide evidence that the PMd plays a role in multiplexing both perceptual and mnemonic information, extending its competence beyond the association of perceptual input with motor decisions.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

P.; Martineau, S.; Nasr, M.", "abstract": "How the brain enables individuals to adapt behavior to their partner is key to understanding social exchange. For example, courtship behavior involves sensorimotor processing of signals by prospective partners that can result in behavioral dialogue, such as stereotyped movements and singing. The courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster males with their partners, which are usually female but can also be male, involves singing. To investigate how behavioral feedback and sensorimotor processing contribute to flexible social interactions, we compared the courtship behavior and singing of male D. melanogaster towards males and females. Quantitative analysis of their interactions revealed that while underlying courtship and song rules are unaffected by the sex of the partner, the behavioral dynamics and song sequences differ by partner sex. This divergence stems from sex-specific behavioral feedback: females decelerate to song, while males orient towards the singer. Moreover, optogenetic manipulations reveal that the partners responses are driven by a specific neural circuit that links song detection with arousal and social decisions. Our findings demonstrate that flexible social behaviors can arise from fixed sensorimotor rules through a context-dependent selection facilitated by the partners behavioral feedback. More broadly, our results reveal compositionality as a key mechanism for achieving behavioral flexibility during complex social interactions such as courtship.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Recent work has extended this concept to gray matter morphology in the brain, but no such reference framework currently exists for white matter (WM) even though WM constitutes the essential substrate for neuronal communication and large-scale network integration. Here, we present the first comprehensive WM brain charts, which describe how microstructural and macrostructural features of WM evolve across the lifespan, by leveraging over 26,199 diffusion MRI scans from 42 harmonized studies. Using generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), we estimate age- and sex-stratified trajectories for 72 individual white matter pathways, quantifying both tract-specific microstructural and morphometric features. We demonstrate that these WM brain charts enable four important applications: (1) defining normative trajectories of WM maturation and decline across distinct pathways, (2) identifying previously uncharacterized developmental milestones and spatial gradients of tract maturation, (3) detecting individualized deviations from normative patterns with clinical relevance across multiple neurological disorders, and (4) facilitating standardized, cross-study centile scoring of new datasets. By establishing a unified, interpretable reference framework for WM structure, these brain charts provide a foundational metric for research and clinical neuroscience. The accompanying open-access trajectories, centile scoring tools, and harmonization methods facilitate precise mapping of WM development, aging, and pathology across diverse populations.

Recent evidence from the human brain and AI models pointed to visual processing as a core substrate for representing emotional valence of natural images, but this conclusion may not generalize to complex social scenes. We implemented experiments with social scenes in which emotional valence is partially dissociated from visual characteristics, objects, and scene settings. Human behavior, neuroimaging, and visual AI models confirm that visual processing captures basic emotional associations of objects and scene elements. However, when the valence of social scenes is incongruent with these basic properties, higher levels of processing are needed in the human association cortex and AI models. Our results show how and when valence processing demands advanced cognitive, neural, and computational processes that extend beyond the encoding of visual features.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

C.; Volkart, N. S.; Ganslosser, U.", "abstract": "Feral dogs (Canis familiaris) are an emerging threat to biodiversity on Navarino Island, Chile, where they have become apex predators in the absence of natural carnivores. This study evaluated the spatial distribution of feral dogs and their impacts on native species, including guanacos (Lama guanicoe), upland geese (Chloephaga picta), and flightless steamer ducks (Tachyeres pteneres). Presence-only data collected during two field expeditions were analysed using species distribution models (MaxEnt) to predict habitat suitability for feral dogs and guanacos. Habitat connectivity analyses identified at least two potentially isolated feral dog populations. Using generalised linear and non-linear models, we assessed the ecological impacts of feral dogs, finding significant habitat overlap with guanacos, particularly in central areas of the island. This overlap corresponded to a reduced likelihood of guanaco occurrence, suggesting behavioural adaptations to disturbance and predation pressure. Upland geese exhibited a negative association with both actual and predicted feral dog presence, while flightless steamer ducks appeared unaffected. Furthermore, NDVI changes observed on Navarino Island compared to Torres del Paine, where noinvasive species are present, are likely linked to the spread of invasive species and the decline of guanacos in the Magellanic forest, highlighting the cascading ecological consequences of feral dog invasion. Our findings emphasise the urgent need for feral dog management to protect vulnerable species and maintain ecosystem health, particularly in fragile environments where invasive predators can have disproportionate impacts.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}

Initial evidence for disassortative HLA-pairing in the European-descent Hutterites2 has tended not to replicate in other populations. Recent studies, rather, reflect assortative mating associated with cosmopolitan population structure1. Although their configuration is more relevant to the majority of human evolutionary history, few small-scale, endogamous populations have been examined. Here, we test whether the extent of HLA dissimilarity between individuals influences mate choice by contrasting chosen partnerships (both love marriages and informal partnerships) with arranged partnerships among the Himba, an endogamous and formerly natural fertility group living in northern Namibia. With targeted sequencing we typed eight classical HLA genes for n=366 individuals and recorded self-reported partnership types and informal partnerships discovered through shared biological offspring. Across 249 known partnerships, we find no difference in HLA dissimilarity between chosen and arranged partnerships and no effect of the two partnership types that differs from a random, background distribution of partnerships. We also looked directly for fitness benefits of the potential offspring genotypes by testing HLA-based pathogen binding affinities, but also found no difference between arranged and chosen partners and no effects that differed from random partners. It is possible that due to high background HLA diversity in the Himba, most unrelated individuals in the population are sufficiently dissimilar at the HLA that there are few fitness benefits to offspring by maximizing mate dissimilarity. We do find, however, extensive haplotype sharing at the HLA region, suggestive of recent positive selection3,4. Episodes of fluctuating positive selection may be a more important driver in maintenance of HLA polymorphism than disassortative mating.", "date": "2025-05-08", "journal": ""}
