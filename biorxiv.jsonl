We present Cflows, an AI framework that combines neural ODE networks with Granger causality to infer continuous cell state transitions and gene regulatory interactions from static scRNA-seq data. In a new 5-time point dataset capturing tumorsphere development over 30 days, Cflows reconstructs two types of trajectories leading to tumorsphere formation or apoptosis. Trajectory-based cell-of-origin analysis delineated a novel cancer stem cell profile characterized by CD44hi EPCAM+ CAV1+ , and uncovered a cell cycle-dependent enrichment of tumorsphere-initiating potential in G2/M or S-phase cells. Cflows uncovers ESRRA as a crucial causal driver of the tumor-forming gene regulatory network. Indeed, ESRRA inhibition significantly reduces tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Cflows offers a powerful framework for uncovering cellular transitions and dynamic regulatory networks from static single-cell data.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Standard molecular clock methods relying on contemporary sequences often underestimate viral ages, conflicting with paleovirological and biogeographical evidence. Here, we apply the Prisoner of War model, which accounts for time-dependent rate effects, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of primate lentiviruses. Using non-recombinant genomic regions from 436 HIV, SIV, and pSIV sequences, we estimate that the most recent common ancestor of extant SIVs dates to ~1 million years ago. The lineages giving rise to HIV-1 and HIV-2 (SIVcpz and SIVsmm) have circulated in their respective hosts for tens to hundreds of thousands of years, suggesting prolonged pre-pandemic human exposure. The divergence of SIV and pSIV is dated to 17-51 million years ago, consistent with lentiviral transfer during the last mammalian colonisation of Madagascar. Our analysis integrates lentiviral data across recent (HIV), intermediate (Bioko Island SIVs), and ancient (pSIV) timescales, enabling inferences not possible from any single timescale alone, and recovers both shallow and deep divergence events without relying on fixed internal node calibrations. This unified framework provides new insights into virus-host coevolution and zoonotic risk.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

D.; Yang, F.; Marchetto, S.; Borg, J.-P.", "abstract": "Convergent extension (CE) is a fundamental morphogenetic process where oriented cell behaviors lead to polarized extension of diverse tissues. In vertebrates, regulation of CE requires both non-canonical Wnt, its co-receptor Ror, and several core members of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. PCP was originally identified as a mechanism to coordinate the cellular polarity in the plane of static epithelium, where core proteins Frizzled (Fz)/ Dishevelled (Dvl) and Van Gogh-like (Vangl)/ Prickle (Pk) partition to opposing cell cortex. But how core PCP proteins interact with each other to mediate non-canonical Wnt/ Ror signaling during CE is not clear. We found previously that during CE, Vangl cell-autonomously recruits Dvl to the plasma membrane and keeps Dvl inactive. In this study, we show that non-canonical Wnt induces Dvl to transition from Vangl to Fz. Pk inhibits the transition, and functionally synergize with Vangl to suppress Dvl during CE. Conversely, Ror is required for the transition, and functionally antagonizes Vangl. Biochemically, Vangl interacts directly with both Ror and Dvl. Ror and Dvl do not bind directly, but can be cofractionated with Vangl. Collectively, we propose that Pk assists Vangl to function as an unconventional adaptor that brings Dvl and Ror into a complex to serves two functions: 1) simultaneously preventing both Dvl and Ror from ectopically activating non-canonical Wnt signaling; and 2) relaying Dvl to Fz for signaling activation upon non-canonical Wnt induced dimerization of Fz and Ror.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Patients with Williams syndrome suffer from cardiovascular and neuropsychological symptoms. So far, the structural abnormalities of the cardiovascular system in Williams syndrome have been attributed to the loss of a copy of the elastin (ELN) gene. In contrast, the neuropsychological consequences of Williams syndrome, including motor deficits, hypersociability and cognitive impairments, have been mainly attributed to altered expression of transcription factors like LIMK1, GTF2I and GTF2IRD1, while the potential secondary impact of altered cerebrovascular function has been largely ignored. To study the relation between the mutation underlying Williams syndrome and vascularization of not only the heart but also that of the brain, we generated a mouse model with a relatively long microdeletion, including the Ncf1 gene to reduce the confounding impact of hypertension. The affected mice had an elongated and tortuous aorta, but unlike in Eln haploinsufficient mice, there were no signs of structural cardiac hypertrophy. Our Williams syndrome mice had similar structural abnormalities in their coronary and brain vessels, showing disorganized extracellular matrices of the vessel walls. Moreover, our mouse model faithfully replicated both cardiovascular and neurological symptoms of Williams syndrome, highlighting that accurate non-invasive evaluation of complex vascular abnormalities is feasible. Altogether, we present evidence for vascular malformations that are similar in heart and brain, suggesting that cardiovascular and neurological symptoms can both by impacted by changes in the vascular structure in patients with Williams syndrome.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Branch length estimation is a fundamental problem in Statistical Phylogenetics and a core component of tree reconstruction algorithms. Traditionally, general time-reversible mutation models are employed, and many software tools exist for this scenario. With the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 lineage tracing technologies, there has been significant interest in the study of branch length estimation under irreversible mutation models. Under the CRISPR/Cas9 mutation model, irreversible mutations -- in the form of DNA insertions or deletions -- are accrued during the experiment, which are then read out at the single-cell level to reconstruct the cell lineage tree. However, most of the analyses of CRISPR/Cas9 lineage tracing data have so far been limited to the reconstruction of single-cell tree topologies, which depict lineage relationships between cells, but not the amount of time that has passed between ancestral cell states and the present. Time-resolved trees, known as chronograms, would allow one to study the evolutionary dynamics of cell populations at an unprecedented level of resolution. Indeed, time-resolved trees would reveal the timing of events on the tree, the relative fitness of subclones, and the dynamics underlying phenotypic changes in the cell population -- among other important applications. In this work, we introduce the first scalable and accurate method to refine any given single-cell tree topology into a single-cell chronogram by estimating its branch lengths. To do this, we perform regularized maximum likelihood estimation under a general irreversible mutation model, paired with a conservative version of maximum parsimony that reconstructs only the ancestral states that we are confident about. To deal with the particularities of CRISPR/Cas9 lineage tracing data -- such as double-resection events which affect runs of consecutive sites -- we avoid making our model more complex and instead opt for using a simple but effective data encoding scheme. Similarly, we avoid explicitly modeling the missing data mechanisms -- such as heritable missing data -- by instead assuming that they are missing completely at random. We stabilize estimates in low-information regimes by using a simple penalized version of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using a minimum branch length constraint and pseudocounts. All this leads to a convex MLE problem that can be readily solved in seconds with off-the-shelf convex optimization solvers. We benchmark our method using both simulations and real lineage tracing data, and show that it performs well on several tasks, matching or outperforming competing methods such as TiDeTree and LAML in terms of accuracy, while being 10~100x faster. Notably, our statistical model is simpler and more general, as we do not explicitly model the intricacies of CRISPR/Cas9 lineage tracing data. In this sense, our contribution is twofold: (1) a fast and robust method for branch length estimation under a general irreversible mutation model, and (2) a data encoding scheme specific to CRISPR/Cas9-lineage tracing data which makes it amenable to the general model. Our branch length estimation method, which we call ConvexML, should be broadly applicable to any evolutionary model with irreversible mutations (ideally, with high diversity) and an approximately ignorable missing data mechanism. ConvexML is available through the convexml open source Python package.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Mice blocked at different stages of T-cell development reveal that CD4+ single-positive (SP) and CD8SP thymocytes differentially support homeostasis and activation of cDC1s versus cDC2s/plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), respectively. CD8SPs indirectly support pDC survival and cDC2 thymic immigration, and they induce interferon signaling in cDCs, partly by promoting Type III interferon expression by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). In contrast, CD4SPs undergo cognate interactions with cDCs, inducing CD40 signaling required for activation of cDC1s. Activated cDC1s make non-redundant contributions to central tolerance.

While drinking water-based administration is ideal for sustained exposure in high feasibility, available compounds are limited, with thioacetamide (TAA) being the primary option. Here, we aimed to establish a novel drinking water-induced mouse model of cholestatic liver injury using 4,4'-methylenedianiline (MDA), and to characterize its pathological trajectory in comparison to the TAA model. Methods: Mice were administered MDA via drinking water for 28 Days. To elucidate the early events that give rise to chronic pathological divergence, we conducted a multi-layered analysis comprising plasma biochemical assays, immune cell profiling by flow cytometry, and hepatic transcriptomics at five time points during the early phase. The MDA model was evaluated against the established TAA model. Results: MDA administration induced sustained ALT elevation, peribiliary fibrosis, and spatially irregular focal hepatocellular necrosis, distinguishing it from the centrilobular injury observed with TAA. Early-phase analyses revealed model-specific differences in immunological and molecular responses, including increased CD8 T cell populations and enrichment of fibrinolysis-related gene expression in MDA-DW mice.

Slow wave activity, recorded in the sleep electroencepha-logram (EEG), reliably indexes age-related changes in sleep pressure as well as defi-cits related to developmental disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We aimed to determine whether wake EEG measured before and after sleep could index the same developmental changes in sleep pressure, using data collected from 163 participants 3-25 years old. We analyzed age- and sleep-dependent changes in two measures of oscillatory activity, amplitudes and density, as well as two measures of aperiodic activity, offsets and exponents. We then compared these wake measures to sleep slow wave amplitudes and slopes. Finally, we compared wake EEG in children with ADHD (N=58) to neurotypical controls. Of the four wake measures, only oscillation amplitudes consistently exhibited the same changes as sleep slow waves. Wake amplitudes decreased with age, decreased after sleep, and this overnight de-crease decreased with age. Furthermore, wake amplitudes were significantly related to both sleep slow wave amplitudes and slopes. Wake oscillation densities decreased overnight in children but increased overnight in adolescents and adults. Aperiodic off-sets decreased linearly with age, decreased after sleep, and were significantly related to sleep slow wave amplitudes. Aperiodic exponents also decreased with age, but in-creased after sleep. No wake measure showed significant effects of ADHD. Overall, our results indicate that wake oscillation amplitudes, and to some extent aperiodic offsets, behave like sleep slow waves across sleep and development.

Despite the importance of the accessory factors, they are poorly conserved at the sequence level suggesting that these factors may adopt unique functions in different species.

To address this gap, we induced gradual changes in gene expression of four genes using CRISPR activation and inactivation. Downstream transcriptional consequences of dosage modulation of three master trans-regulators associated with blood cell traits (GFI1B, NFE2, and MYB) were examined using targeted single-cell multimodal sequencing. We showed that guide tiling around the TSS is the most effective way to modulate cis gene expression across a wide range of fold-changes, with further effects from chromatin accessibility and histone marks that differ between the inhibition and activation systems. Our single-cell data allowed us to precisely detect subtle to large gene expression changes in dozens of trans genes, revealing that many responses to dosage changes of these three TFs are non-linear, including non-monotonic behaviours, even when constraining the fold-changes of the master regulators to a copy number gain or loss. We found that the dosage properties are linked to gene constraint and that some of these non-linear responses are enriched for disease and GWAS genes.

Here, we addressed the possibility that thyroid hormones are also required to maintain the function of mature parvalbumin neurons in the mouse neocortex. To this end, Cre/loxP recombination system was used to express a dominant-negative mutated receptor of thyroid hormones to selectively eliminate thyroid hormone signaling in parvalbumin neurons after the onset of parvalbumin expression. We analyzed the neocortical phenotype of these mice by combining genomics, histology, electrophysiology, sleep recordings and behavioral analysis. In the mutant mice, gene expression analysis revealed a decreased expression of key perineuronal net components. parvalbumin neuron excitability was decreased and mice displayed behavioral hyperactivity and increased susceptibility to epileptic seizures. Additionally, sleep analysis revealed that mutant mice spent more time awake, and had a delayed transition to sleep. Electrophysiological recordings further demonstrated altered gamma oscillations in the somatosensory cortex. The findings of this study underscore that thyroid hormones are essential not only for the differentiation of parvalbumin interneurons, but also for the maintenance of their inhibitory function after the onset of parvalbumin expression.

Do brain regions reflect competing or shared decision computations? Are decision signals generated by distributed circuits or are they computed locally and then broadcast broadly? To address these fundamental questions, we took a brain-wide approach, simultaneously recording from thousands of neurons across up to twenty brain regions in rats performing a decision making task requiring gradual accumulation of auditory evidence. This allowed decoding, on single trials and for each of the simultaneously recorded regions, the time-varying state of the decision as it is being formed. We found strong moment-by-moment co-fluctuations in decision states across regions, even across trials with identical stimuli and choices. Remarkably, the co-fluctuations predominantly spanned a single dimension, indicating a single integrated decision computation shared across the brain. However, the shared decision signals were strongest, and were detected earliest on single trials, in a subset of interconnected frontal cortical regions and anterior striatum, indicating that they are computed in a small subnetwork and then globally propagated. We also decoded from each region the estimated time of decision commitment, which corresponds to when the subject covertly \"makes up their mind\" and stops considering new evidence. We again found strong co-fluctuations in the timing of this estimate across regions that lay along a single dominant dimension. Commitment signals were strongest and detected earliest in primary motor cortex. Finally, the moment of decision commitment marked a critical transition in coordinated decision-related activity across the brain. These results show that, on single trials, signals related to an upcoming decision are highly dynamic, reflecting computations in local circuits that are broadcast globally, leading to dramatic and highly coherent moment-by-moment changes in decision-related activity across the brain.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

We discuss biophysical strategies that may allow cells to mitigate the consequences of electrogenicity at additional metabolic cost and postulate an interesting role for a voltage-dependence of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Our work shows that the pump's electrogenicity can open an additional axis of vulnerability that may play a role in brain disease.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

We apply this approach of multimodal synapse profiling to study ketamine plasticity. Results map a causal network of NR2A-depletion-induced changes to synaptic scaffolding and receptor proteins, driven by synaptic activity and local mRNA translation, which translates to Grin2a models of schizophrenia in vitro and in vivo.

B.; Ensminger, I.; Stinchcombe, J. R.; Frederickson, M. E.", "abstract": "Climate change is altering both soil microbial communities and the ecological context of plant-microbe interactions. Heat, drought, and their legacies can alter soil microbiomes and potential plant symbionts, but the direct consequences of these microbial changes on plant performance and plant investment in symbiosis remain underexplored. Predicting how soil microbes modulate plant resilience to heat and drought is critical to mitigating the negative effects of climate change on ecosystems and agriculture. In this study, we conducted growth chamber experiments to isolate the microbially-mediated indirect effects of heat and drought on plant performance and symbiosis. In the first experiment, focused on drought, we found that drought and drought-treated microbes, along with their interaction, significantly decreased the biomass of Medicago lupulina plants compared to well-watered microbiomes and conditions. In a second experiment, we then tested how the addition of a well-known microbial mutualist, Sinorhizobium meliloti, affected heat- and drought-treated microbiomes' impact on M. lupulina. We found that drought-adapted microbiomes negatively impacted legume performance by increasing mortality and reducing branch number, but that adding rhizobia erased differences in plant response to climate treated soils. In contrast, heat-adapted microbiomes did not differ significantly from control microbiomes in their effects on a legume. Our results suggest microbial legacy effects, mutualist partners, and their interactions are important in mediating plant responses to drought, with some mutualists equalizing plant responses across microbial legacies.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Results: In this paper, we present \"DiffBreed\", a differentiable breeding simulator.

The inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity of GBM presents significant obstacles to effective clinical progression of novel treatments by contributing to tumour plasticity and rapid drug resistance that confounds contemporary target directed drug discovery strategies. Phenotypic drug screening is ideally suited to heterogeneous diseases, where targeting specific oncogenic drivers have been broadly ineffective. Our hypothesis is that a modern phenotypic led approach using disease relevant patient-derived GBM stem cell systems will be the most productive approach to identifying new therapeutic targets, drug classes and future drug combinations that target the heterogeneity of GBM. In this study we incorporate a panel of patient-derived GBM stem cell lines into an automated and unbiased Cell Painting assay to quantify multiple GBM stem cell phenotypes. By screening several compound libraries at multiple concentrations across a panel of patient-derived GBM stem cells we provide the first comprehensive survey of distinct pharmacological classes and known druggable targets, including all clinically approved drug classes and oncology drug candidates upon multiple GBM stem cell phenotypes linked to cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Our data set representing, 3866 compounds, 2.2million images and 64000 datapoints is the largest phenotypic screen carried out to date on a panel of patient-derived GBM stem cell models that we are aware of. We seek to identify agents and target classes which engender potent activity across heterogenous GBM genotypes and phenotypes, in this study we further characterize two validated target classes, histone deacetylase inhibitors and cyclin dependent kinases that exert broad and potent effects on the phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles of GBM stem cells.

Full self-sufficiency would require exceeding this threshold. When comparing the areas of cultivated land obtained by growing both species separately or together, intercropping could save 27-30% of land as soon as more soybean is produced in 1 ha of intercropping than in 0.5 ha of sole soybean.

C.; Thorson, J.", "abstract": "Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to standardize spatially unbalanced data, project climate impacts, and identify habitat for conservation. SDMs typically estimate the impact of local environmental conditions by estimating a dome-shaped or non-parametric ``environmental response function''. However, ecological responses often integrate across local habitat conditions, such that species density depends on habitat at the location of sampling but also at nearby locations. To address this, we extend methods from the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) method that is widely used in INLA, which approximates spatial correlations based on local diffusion over a finite-element mesh (FEM). We specifically introduce the sparse inverse-diffusion operator on a FEM, and apply this operator to covariates to efficiently calculate a spatially weighted average of local habitat that is then passed through pointwise basis-expansion to predict species densities. We show that this operator has several useful properties, i.e., conservation of mass, linear computational time with spatial resolution, and invariance to linear (scale and offset) transformations of covariates. We test this covariate-diffusion method using a simulation experiment, and show that it can correctly recover a non-local environmental response while collapsing to a local (pointwise) response when warranted. We apply it to monitoring data for 25 bottom-associated fishes in the eastern Bering Sea and 20 bird species in the western United States. This application confirms that non-local responses in the eastern Bering Sea case study are parsimonious for 26 species-maturity combinations, while 18 collapse to the pointwise method. Estimates suggest that some species-maturity combinations avoid proximity to the continental slope, beyond what is predicted by local bathymetry in isolation. By contrast, in four of the 20 bird species is the diffused human population density covariate more parsimonious than the original covariate. The covariate-diffusion method introduced here constitutes a fast and efficient approach to modelling non-local covariate effects. This flexible method may be useful in cases when covariates influence nearby population densities, for instance due to movement of the sampled species or its important biological or physical drivers.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

RASP is designed to be orders-of-magnitude faster than existing techniques, scale to datasets with 100,000+ locations, support flexible integration of non-transcriptomic covariates, and reconstruct de-noised, spatially-smoothed gene expression values. It employs a randomized two-stage PCA framework and configurable spatial smoothing. RASP was compared to BASS, GraphST, SEDR, SpatialPCA, STAGATE, and CellCharter using diverse ST datasets (10x Visium, Stereo-Seq, MERFISH, 10x Xenium) on human and mouse tissues. In these benchmarks, RASP delivers comparable or superior accuracy in tissue-domain detection while achieving substantial improvements in computational speed. Its efficiency not only reduces runtime and resource requirements but also makes it practical to explore a broad range of spatial-smoothing parameters in a high-throughput fashion.

Here, we obtained electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning data from 62 participants (31 pairs) who played a computerised version of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, a classic paradigm for studying competitive decision-making. Although the optimal strategy is to be unpredictable and thus act randomly, participants exhibited behavioural biases, deviating from this ideal.

Notably, losers showed unique reliance on prior trials, suggesting memory-based strategies that may impair optimal performance.

Because tooth development occurs through complex interactions between manifold processes, there are many potential mechanisms which can contribute to a tooths norm of reaction. Determining the identity of those mechanisms and the relative importance of each of them is one of the main challenges to understanding phenotypic plasticity. Quantitative proteomics combined with experimental studies allow for the identification of potential molecular contributors to a plastic response through quantification of expressed gene products. Here, we present the results of a quantitative proteomics analysis of mature upper first molars in Mus musculus from a controlled feeding experiment. Pregnant and nursing mothers were fed either a low-dietary protein (10%) treatment diet or control (20%) diet. Low-dietary protein was not associated with reduced molar size or skull length. However, expression of tooth-related proteins, immune system proteins, and actin-based myosin proteins were significantly altered in our low-dietary protein proteomics sample. The differential expression of immune proteins along with systematic reduction in actin-based myosin protein expression are novel discoveries for tooth proteomics studies.

ECD associates with mRNA of several key glycolytic genes and is required for their stability, consistent with our recent demonstration of ECD as an RNA binding protein.

Current approaches typically make restrictive assumptions such as representing tissue regions by local abundances of manually typed, discrete cell types, or representing samples in terms of abundances of manually called, discrete spatial structures; this risks overlooking important signals. Here we introduce variational inference-based microniche analysis (VIMA), a method that combines deep learning with principled statistics to discover associated spatial features with greater flexibility and precision. VIMA trains an ensemble of variational autoencoders to extract numerical \"fingerprints\" from small tissue patches that capture their biological content. It uses these fingerprints to define a large number of data-dependent \"microniches\" -- small, potentially overlapping groups of tissue patches with highly similar biology that span multiple samples. It then meta-analyzes across the autoencoders to identify microniches whose abundance correlates with case-control status while controlling for multiple testing. We show in simulations that VIMA is well calibrated. We then apply VIMA to spatial datasets spanning three different diseases and spatial modalities: a 7-marker immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy dataset in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a 52-marker CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX) dataset in ulcerative colitis (UC), and a 140-gene spatial transcriptomics dataset in dementia.

Yet, in many cases, concrete, sensory signals of past information must be transformed into the abstract codes to guide future cognition. However, this process remains poorly understood. Here, human participants used WM to maintain a separate spatial location in each hemifield wherein locations were embedded in a learned spatial sequence.

Plastic organisms, such as planarians, can regenerate, grow, and degrow as adults while maintaining precise whole-body and organ tissue shapes. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathways that coordinate and integrate these signals into the correct balance between cellular growth, mitosis, and apoptosis to form emergent target tissue shapes remain poorly understood. Here, we present a systematic theoretical study of the biological drivers controlling the feedback mechanisms between tissue growth and morphogen signaling. The approach is based on lattice-free, center-based simulations of cell size dynamics, mitosis, and apoptosis governed by both intercellular diffusible morphogen concentrations and mechanical stress between cells to drive their spatial organization. The results demonstrate how different morphogen properties and tissue mechanics form a feedback loop that is essential for the robust regulation of target tissue shapes. Furthermore, we show that stable tissue shapes can emerge from self-regulated patterning processes, such as Turing systems, controlling cellular growth dynamics. A stable feedback loop can form between the emergent morphogen patterns and the dynamics of cellular growth they regulate, as the tissue dynamics define the domain in which morphogens diffuse and hence pattern. Overall, this study highlights the essential role of the feedback loop between morphogen patterning and cellular growth in the regulation of tissue dynamics for stable shape formation.

We built a probability map of the origin of sorghum domestication in Eastern Africa using genomic data and spatial Bayesian models. The origin was located in Eastern Sudan and Western Ethiopia, in perfect concordance with recent archaeobotanical evidence. Calibrated on archaeological remains, our genomic-based model suggests that the beginning of the expansion of sorghum agriculture took place around 4,600 years ago. Spread of sorghum cultivation led to a sorghum population structure fitting ethnolinguistic groups at different scales, suggesting that human social groups and sorghum populations co-diffused. Consequently, ethnolinguistic barriers and social preferences, as well as adaptation to specific climate zones, have contributed to structuring domesticated sorghum diversity during its diffusion.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

In a mouse ex vivo slice preparation, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to measure intrinsic properties, excitability, action potential (AP) shape, voltage-activated conductances, and neuromodulation in the newly-categorized superficial tufted cells (sTCs) compared with those of mitral cells (MCs). We propose that a marked difference in voltage-dependent current represents distinct ion channel populations that affect the kinetics of action potentials, and evokes an increase in sTC firing frequency, albeit both types of projection neurons having similar AP spiking activity. Triple-colored immunofluorescence and RNA scope were used to detect co-localization of the Kv1.3 ion channel and the insulin receptor in sTCs, with ~73% of sTCs expressing both. The sTCs were modulated by bath application of insulin; increasing AP firing frequency by 97%, attributable to an 8% decrease in the intraburst interval, and a reduction of the latency to first spike by 37%. We conclude that there may be a range of neuromodulators of sTCs that may alter excitability and fine-tune olfactory information processing or metabolic balance.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

The fitness benefit conferred by RNA-mediated regulation is often subtle and challenging to measure and may be highly influenced by the environment. Yet selective forces are sufficient to generate and maintain complex RNA structures that allow rapid and robust response to stimuli. In this work we perform deep mutational scanning to measure the relative fitness conferred by all single mutants of an FMN riboswitch to the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae under seven different conditions. We find that in standard culture conditions the RNA sequence is not under selective pressure, however the dynamic conditions encountered during mouse lung infection reveal an sequence that is under weak purifying selection, but robust to strongly deleterious mutations. Furthermore, assessment of fitness in the presence of two different targeting antibiotics exposes diverging adaptive landscapes that reveal suites of mutations conferring either constitutive activation or repression of gene expression. Analysis of these landscapes highlights a complex relationship between antibiotic concentration and the fitness benefit conferred by individual mutations as well as illuminates the mechanism of action for this RNA with lessons broadly applicable to interpretation of bacterial transcriptomics.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Current standard-of-care primarily relies on cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but long-term outcomes remain poor largely due to early relapse, therapy resistance, and high incidents of metastases. More recently, dopamine signaling has emerged as a novel area of interest in cancer biology. Dopamine receptors have been implicated in tumor progression, maintenance of cancer stem-like cells, and therapy resistance in various malignancies, including TNBC. Quetiapine (QTP), an FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic and DRD2/DRD3 antagonist, has shown preclinical efficacy in glioblastoma. However, its anti-tumor potential in TNBC remains unexplored. Methods: Clonogenic survival and mammosphere-forming assays were used to evaluate QTP's anti-tumor activity in TNBC cell lines (SUM159-PT, BT-549, and MDA-MB-231). Cells were treated with QTP alone or in combination with a single dose of 4 Gy radiation or standard chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin, paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil). Apoptotic cell death was evaluated using Annexin V/propidium iodide flow cytometry, while DNA double-strand breaks were assessed through gamma-H2AX staining. Transwell assays were conducted to examine QTP's impact on both untreated bulk tumor cells and those surviving sublethal radiation exposure. Additionally, the effect of QTP on DNA repair dynamics was investigated by monitoring the resolution of gamma-H2AX foci over time following treatment. Results: QTP significantly reduced clonogenicity and self-renewal in all TNBC models tested, both alone and in combination with radiation or chemotherapy. In apoptosis assays, QTP treatment induced a marked increase in early and late apoptotic cell populations. QTP also promoted DNA double-strand break formation and delayed repair, as indicated by persistent gamma-H2AX foci at 24 hours post-treatment. Additionally, QTP impaired the migratory capacity of both untreated and radiation-surviving cells. Combination treatments with QTP and doxorubicin produced synergistic effects, resulting in complete loss of colony-forming ability and mammosphere formation. Conclusions: The data presented in this study support the repurposing of quetiapine as an adjuvant therapeutic agent alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy in TNBC. By targeting apoptosis, DNA repair, and cancer cell migration, QTP offers a novel, multi-faceted approach to improving outcomes in this high-risk breast cancer subtype.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

We discovered an inverse kinetic relationship: the outer hair cell's (OHC) slow, somatic contraction is essential for generating a fast electrical response. Pharmacologically blocking the OHC motor protein prestin inverted this dynamic; the OHC's mechanical contraction became faster, while the normally rapid electrical potential became nearly ten times slower.

This is particularly relevant in vascular malformations, where venous differentiation remains poorly understood, and the role of transcription factors in specifying venous identity is only beginning to be elucidated. Here, we combine live-cell single-molecule imaging with genomics-based approaches to uncover a biophysical mechanism of transcription factor antagonism that underpins venous identity. We show that SOX18 and NR2F2 antagonistically co-regulate venous differentiation through dynamic feedback between their nuclear populations. This interaction is disrupted in vascular malformation syndrome caused by a de novo heterozygous NR2F2 mutation, presenting with aberrant vascular integrity and bleeding. Treatment with an FDA-approved drug, known to inhibit SOX18, led to marked clinical improvement in the proband. To dissect the molecular mechanism underlying this mutation and the drug response, we used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) engineered to carry the proband's NR2F2 variant. These cells exhibited impaired hESC to venous differentiation with no effect on artery EC differentiation. In silico modelling and live-cell molecular imaging revealed that the NR2F2 variant is hyper-mobile, fails to form homodimers, and cannot recruit SOX18, thereby disrupting a critical transcriptional antagonism that underpins venous endothelial identity. We demonstrate that targeted pharmacological inhibition of SOX18 restores this regulatory balance in hESC-derived venous endothelial cells, rescuing both gene expression and NR2F2 binding dynamics at the single-molecule level. Together, this study uncovers a biophysical mechanism of transcription factor antagonism that governs venous differentiation and offers a framework for developing targeted therapies for rare vascular malformations.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

K.; Bag, A.; Pang, Y.; Bagga, P.", "abstract": "Purpose: To develop and validate a novel chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI method to map skeletal muscle OXPHOS (Oxidative Phosphorylation CEST or OXCEST). Theory and Methods: Our proposed OXCEST method acquires creatine (Cr)-weighted CEST maps by applying RF saturation (B1) at only two frequency offsets: +1.8 ppm (targeting the Cr amine resonance) and -1.8 ppm (to calculate MTRasym at 1.8 ppm). The pre-exercise MTRasym is modeled as a second-order polynomial function (f) of B0. Next, the post-exercise alteration in MTRasym is hypothesized to be affected by both an exercise-induced increase in Cr and changes in B0 inhomogeneity. By inputting post-exercise B0 values into f, the change in MTRasym due to B0 variation alone was estimated. Thus, the Cr-related post-exercise MTRasym could be isolated and quantified. OXCEST and 31P-MRS were performed in seven subjects across two sessions to compare the OXCEST-derived Cr recovery time constant (TCr) with the ground-truth phosphocreatine recovery time constant (TPCr). Results: A second-order polynomial function f could reliably describe the relationship between pre-exercise MTRasym and B0 (R2=0.87{+/-}0.07 in the lateral gastrocnemius (LG); R2=0.98{+/-}0.01 in the medial gastrocnemius (MG); R2=0.96{+/-}0.03 in the soleus). The mean pre-exercise MTRasym was approximately 6-7% for all muscle groups. Following exercise, MTRasym increased by 11.4{+/-}4.5% in LG and 8{+/-}2.4% in MG, and showed mono-exponential recovery (R2>0.97).

While A. baumannii can acquire environmental DNA through multiple mechanisms including natural competence, one of the most common is acquisition via plasmids by conjugation. One of the challenges for conjugation is an active Type VI Secretion System (T6SS), which kills nonkin bacteria and therefore inhibits the conjugation. The acquisition of resistance genes has helped the spread of resistant clones of A. baumannii. The most prominently disseminated clones belong to specific sequence types [(ST), Pasteur scheme], namely ST1, ST2, ST10, ST15, ST25, ST79 and ST85 with the ST2 being the most detected ST. While ST1 and ST2 were thoroughly studied, there are new emerging clones whose genetic background facilitating the rise is still unknown or poorly understood. One of the rising clones is A. baumannii ST19, recently reported to be frequently occurring in Georgia and Ukraine. In this study, we have whole-genome sequenced three isolates of A. baumannii ST19 which were then assessed for biofilm production and virulence in the Galleria mellonella in vivo infection model.

Here, we uncover a pivotal, non-canonical role for RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) in driving these chromatin state transitions during Caenorhabditis elegans oogenesis. Using the auxin-inducible degron system to selectively deplete either Pol I catalytic subunits or ribosome assembly factors, we disentangle the consequences of impaired nucleolar integrity from reductions in ribosome biogenesis. Strikingly, although disrupting ribosome assembly caused minimal effects on oocyte production, loss of Pol I activity led to widespread changes in chromatin accessibility, a dampening of the distal-proximal H3K4me3 gradient required for oogenesis, reduced synapsis, and elevated ATM/ATR phosphorylation, resulting in fewer but significantly larger oocytes. Despite their promoters becoming more accessible, oogenesis genes did not show large changes in steady-state mRNA, consistent with transcriptional repression prior to fertilization. Instead, Pol I depletion prematurely remodeled oogenic chromatin, through a misdirection of H3K4me3 deposition towards promoters normally primed for zygotic genome activation. These findings reveal an epigenetic gating function for nucleolar integrity in oocyte maturation: Pol I preserves three-dimensional chromatin organization and maintains proper spatiotemporal regulation of histone modifications, independent of ribosome production. Given the evolutionary conservation of nucleolar dynamics and histone modifications during gametogenesis, our work suggests that nucleolar stress, whether from environmental factors, aging, or genetic disorders, could broadly compromise fertility by disrupting oogenic chromatin priming.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Although actin dynamics is well known to contribute to pathfinding in wide axonal tips, typically referred to as growth cones, we also observe dynamic actin remodeling throughout neurites and at other, narrower, neurite tips. We find that actin-wave speeds do not change significantly in the first two weeks of neurite development on flat substrates, but decrease over the same period in neurites on nanoridges. The ability of nanoridges to guide actin waves and the neurite-tip direction also decreases as neurites mature, both for narrow tips and wide growth cones.

Here, we utilize optical tweezers to show that a multivalent protein-DNA co-condensate containing the nuclear envelope protein LEM2 (7,8) and the DNA-binding protein BAF (9,10) shield DNA beyond its melting point at 65 pN(11). Under load, their collective assembly induces an unconventional DNA stiffening effect that provides mechanical reinforcement, dependent on the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of LEM2. At the nuclear surface, these components form an elastic surface hydrogel in which LEM2 IDR-IDR interactions contract the surface hydrogel relative to its relaxed state, introducing a pre-stress in the lamin network. Inside cells, this surface hydrogel model can recapitulate elastic properties of the nuclear envelope measured via AFM indentation experiments as well as nuclear morphology, using parameters obtained at the molecular scale by use of optical tweezers. Disruption of the surface hydrogel increases DNA damage and micronuclei formation during nuclear deformation.

Here, we show that a fraction of Cdc13 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm just prior to mitosis. This export could be critical to propagate CDK activity throughout the cell. Mutating three Cdc13 nuclear localization signals (NLSs) led to precocious enrichment of Cdc13 in the cytoplasm but did not accelerate mitotic entry, indicating that the export is not sufficient to trigger entry into mitosis. The export coincides with spindle pole body integration into the nuclear envelope and may be required to coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic signaling required for this integration.

The study involved 305 students from health-related undergraduate and graduate programs. Two simulations were designed: a pharmacokinetics (PK) simulation representing systemic circulation and drug metabolism using plastic blocks and classroom stations; an enzyme kinetics (EK) simulation using both digital slides and physical block sets to model substrate-product reactions and construct Michaelis-Menten curves. Student perceptions were measured using a Likert-scale instrument adapted from validated educational models. Quantitative data (pharmacokinetic and enzymatic curves) were also generated from simulation outcomes. Students successfully built representative pharmacokinetic and enzymatic activity curves, allowing exploration of key concepts such as drug absorption, metabolism, Cmax, Tmax, half-life, and enzyme-substrate reaction rates. Perception surveys revealed high approval levels, particularly regarding the effectiveness, engagement, and collaborative aspects of the simulations. Over 85% of participants preferred the simulation-based approach over traditional lectures. These live-action activities represent a novel, effective, and low-cost strategy for enhancing the teaching of basic sciences in health education.

In this paper, we introduce a dynamic alert system based on a Multi-Attribute Zoonotic Alert Index (Z-Alert) to enhance disease outbreak detection and response in wildlife.

Participants were presented with 1.3 and 2 Hz visual displays of rotating Gabors and judged either the timing or content of these events. We show rate-specific phase-coupling in motor structures to - and beyond - the visual rhythm, that predicts perception of temporal stimulus features. We subsequently devised a rate-specific decoding measure to show that visual structures track anticipated, temporally-precise content regardless of task. This sensory simulation predicted the temporal tracking in motor structures. These findings therefore demonstrate evidence for oscillatory phase coupling in vision and link it to the temporally-precise prediction of future sensory states.

In this study, we established PDOs from surgically resected fresh tissues of human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) across anatomical sites, tumor T-categories, and sample types. These PDOs faithfully recapitulate the tumor's pathology, mutational profile, and drug response. To enable rapid classification of PDO identity, we developed a new convolutional neural network (CNN) model, TransferNet-PDO, which accurately distinguished tumor versus normal PDOs in culture using digital histopathology images (AUC[&ge;]0.88). PDOs maintained stable cultures and were cryopreserved between passages 5 and 12. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (PanCK, p63, Cytokeratin 13, Ki67) confirmed squamous phenotype and histologic aggression of the original tumor. For tumors harboring TP53 mutations by whole-exome sequencing (WES), PDOs retained the corresponding p53 functional status as confirmed by IHC (enhanced or loss of expression). Somatic mutational landscape revealed that PDOs preserved driver somatic mutations, copy number variations (CNVs), and clonal architecture including low-prevalence subclones. Drug sensitivity assessment of PDOs showed that cisplatin reduced cell viability, whereas cetuximab and lenvatinib had minimal effects. Chemoradiation led to greater tumor organoid killing compared to radiation or chemotherapy alone. This study presents an integrated HNSCC PDO platform combining tissue biobanking, organoid establishment, multi-omics characterization, functional drug screening, and AI-driven histopathologic classification, providing a comprehensive and scalable system for translational cancer research.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Among the genes inactivated in PWS, the Magel2 gene is considered a significant contributor to the etiology of the syndrome. The loss of the Magel2 gene causes abnormalities in growth and fertility and increased adiposity with altered metabolism in adulthood, which aligns with some of the pathologies observed in PWS. Given that anxiety is a prominent phenotypic behavior in PWS, we investigate the role of the Magel2 gene, particularly in hypothalamic POMC neurons innervating the medial amygdala (MeA), in the behavioral phenotypes associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Both male and female mice lacking the Magel2 gene in MeA-innervating ARCPomc neurons display no alterations in anxiety-like behavior during the open field test, light/dark test, and elevated plus maze test in the absence of exposure to acute stress. However, male mice with a Magel2 gene deletion in these particular neurons exhibit increased stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and reduce motivation/spatial learning, while female mice do not show these behavioral changes. Our results suggest that the Magel2 gene in ARCPomc neurons, especially in males, influences the impact of stress on anxiety-like behavior and spatial learning deficits associated with a food reward. With the recent approval of a novel treatment for hyperphagia in PWS by the FDA that seems to target the hypothalamic melanocortin system, understanding the cellular mechanisms by which MAGEL2 in ARCPomc neurons innervating the MeA regulates emotional behaviors might help the development of new therapeutic strategies for addressing mental illness in individuals with PWS.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Understanding how regulatory complexity and constraint shape organismal development remains a central challenge in biology. The developmental hourglass framework posits that mid-embryogenesis -the phylotypic stage- is a period of heightened conservation and regulatory organization. We test this using Zebraformer, a transformer-based language model trained on single-cell transcriptomic data from zebrafish embryos. Unlike models focused on prediction or classification, Zebraformer learns context-sensitive representations of genes and cells that encode temporal progression, anatomical identity, and regulatory relationships. Embeddings reflect differentiation timing and transcriptional divergence, while attention-derived gene networks reveal a transient rise in complexity during the phylotypic stage. This stage also exhibits increased perturbation sensitivity and a shift toward centralized, modular network topology. These features are supported by graph-theoretic metrics and gene ontology enrichment, offering data-driven evidence for highly structured regulation during mid-embryogenesis. Our results demonstrate that language models can extract interpretable biological structure and support longstanding developmental theory from high-dimensional data.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Notably, this 'rare biosphere' (5) includes species performing critical ecological functions, such as biogeochemical cycling and resisting invasions 6-9. While bacterial abundance patterns have been extensively studied, the distribution of plasmids - extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements ubiquitous in prokaryotes - remains poorly understood. Using a dataset of 52,909 plasmids from isolates of bacteria and archaea (10), we found that their 16,547 Plasmid Taxonomic Units (PTUs) (11,12) exhibit a distribution with a fat tail, whether in rank abundance or relative abundance distributions: a few highly prevalent PTUs and many rare. The relative abundance distributions are well described by a Poisson log-normal distribution, consistent with recent findings for species abundance distributions across several taxonomic groups (13). The host distribution also presents a heavy tail; however, we show that rare PTUs are not necessarily associated with rare bacterial species, nor are common PTUs exclusively found in common hosts. This indicates that PTUs' distribution is not a direct consequence of hosts' distribution. Per plasmid, the host range of rare PTUs is higher than that of common PTUs, at all taxa levels, from species to phyla. Yet, plasmids from common PTUs are more mobile, likely explaining their success. The large group of rare PTUs constitutes a much more diverse reservoir of genetic material than the group of common PTUs. Under appropriate selective pressures, some of these rare plasmids could spread not only by hitchhiking with their hosts but also through horizontal transfer. Therefore, this work opens new paths into plasmid research.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

This study evaluates the performance of AF2, Boltz-1, Boltz-1x, Boltz-2, Chai-1, Protenix and ESMFold, on a curated dataset of 200 antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complexes. Our findings reveal that AF2 remains a strong predictor against newer AlphaFold3 (AF3)-inspired methods in Ab-Ag complex prediction.

To explore the causes of this variability, we assembled a panel of ten human iPSC lines, for which we evaluated the differentiation potential for two different fates, and profiled the transcriptome and epigenome (chromatin accessibility and three post-translational histone modifications). Using a custom-made computational method involving a Support Vector Machine, we dissected the different regulatory modes through which chromatin states affect transcription. We found that regulation of the Polycomb-mediated histone modification H3K27me3 at specific gene loci exhibited the most consistent differences among iPSC lines, frequently displaying a digital pattern (i.e., binary ON/OFF). We developed a mathematical model based on the read-write feedback of the Polycomb complex, which explained this widespread behaviour and showed that even a small change in Polycomb feedback could lead to pronounced changes in histone modification levels. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the heterogeneity in digital Polycomb regulation mirrors the transcriptomic variability across the iPSC lines studied here, and is one of the major sources of iPSC chromatin heterogeneity. Notably, Polycomb heterogeneity was also correlated with the differentiation potentials of the iPSC lines, suggesting that chromatin variability could be one important factor influencing iPSC differentiation potential.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

In the Drosophila larva, each muscle is co-innervated by a tonic and a phasic glutamatergic MN. Here, we show that the tonic MN1 undergoes robust heterosynaptic sprouting and forms ectopic NMJs when neighboring muscles are deprived of both their native tonic and phasic inputs. This structural plasticity is not induced by silencing, but instead requires the physical ablation of adjacent MNs. Live imaging of the same MN1 axons in individual animals reveals that sprouting initiates early and expands progressively across larval stages. In contrast, phasic MNs show minimal remodeling, indicating that tonic MNs possess a greater intrinsic capacity for neuroplasticity. Notably, as MN1 establishes new synapses on targets it does not normally innervate, it redistributes pre-synaptic territory across both native and ectopic muscles. These findings identify a subtype-specific, injury-induced rewiring program in an intact motor circuit.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Fluctuations in single-neuron activity in sensory cortex often correlate with perceptual decisions. This kind of correlation has been hypothesized to reflect a causal influence of sensory signals on decisions, a feedback influence of decisions on sensory signals, and various other factors as well. To disentangle these different possibilities, we have examined local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the middle temporal (MT) area of non-human primates performing a motion discrimination task. Compared to single-neuron spiking, LFPs have the advantage of being decomposable into different frequencies that are associated with different anatomical sources of input. More importantly, they persist when spiking activity is inactivated, which precludes a causal influence of the corresponding neural activity on behavior. We found that high frequency (70-150 Hz) LFP power was correlated with perceptual decisions and that this correlation disappeared when spikes were inactivated, consistent with a causal role for this frequency band in decision making. These signals overlapped in time with decision signals in lower gamma-band power (30-50 Hz), which persisted after spiking inactivation, suggesting a non-causal, feedback input. Interestingly, lower-frequency LFP signals (5-30 Hz) reflected both impending perceptual decisions and the outcome of previous trials. Our results therefore reveal that neural activity multiplexes different sources of information about perceptual decisions and that these types of information can be estimated reliably from different LFP frequencies.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

SimUrine was systematically developed through iterative optimization of multi-purpose artificial urine, incorporating defined concentrations of carbon sources, vitamins, trace elements, and amino acids within physiologically relevant ranges. The modular design enables component substitution without complete reformulation, facilitating customization for culturomics, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and microbial ecology studies, while reducing batch-to-batch variability associated with authentic urine. Performance evaluation demonstrated SimUrine's capability to support growth of fastidious urobiome members, including Lactobacillus species, Aerococcus urinae, and Corynebacterium riegelii, which fail to proliferate in conventional minimal media. Physicochemical characterization confirmed that SimUrine formulation exhibits properties within normal human urine ranges for density, conductivity, osmolarity, and viscosity, ensuring physiological relevance. Clinical applications revealed reduced antibiotic susceptibility compared to standard media, suggesting more accurate representation of in vivo conditions. Co-culture experiments using Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis demonstrated previously unobserved microbial interactions, highlighting SimUrine's utility for investigating urobiome dynamics.

TASK-1 and TASK-3 K2P channels regulate the resting membrane potential in many different cell types where their activity is also coupled to GqPCR signalling pathways via direct inhibition by diacylglycerol (DAG) generated as a result of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis. This regulation is defective in two different TASK channelopathies, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that DAG inhibition of TASK channel activity is state-dependent. Single channel recordings show that the sensitivity to GqPCR inhibition inversely correlates with channel open probability and that DAG destabilises the open state of TASK-1 to promote channel closure. Combining Molecular Dynamics simulations with mutagenesis studies, we also identify a binding site for DAG in a groove between the M2, M3 and M4 domains, and highlight the crucial role of a specific residue within on M4 (T230) in mediating this inhibitory effect as well as defining the difference in GPCR sensitivity between TASK-1 and TASK-3.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, one member of this family, AHL15, induces somatic embryogenesis and extends plant longevity when overexpressed - the latter through strong repression of several ageing-related developmental transitions. However, its direct target genes and the mechanisms by which it regulates their expression have remained elusive to date. In this study we identified the genome-wide DNA binding sites of AHL15, and show that AHL15 binds throughout the genome at AT-rich sequences near the transcription start- and end sites in regions depleted of epigenetic marks. We show that induction of AHL15 activity causes strong and rapid changes in transcription, with the majority of the differentially expressed genes being downregulated but without directly affecting chromatin accessibility, resulting in developmental defects. In addition, AHL15 binding to regions near the transcription start and end sites was enhanced at genes that were differentially expressed upon AHL15 induction, and was especially strong near the transcription start site of upregulated genes and near the transcription end site of downregulated genes. Finally, we show that AHL15 shares binding sites with the chromatin architectural protein GH1-HMGA2/HON5, which was previously shown to alter transcription by disrupting gene loop formation.

L.; Horne-Badovinac, S.; Matsubayashi, Y.", "abstract": "Collagens are fundamental components of extracellular matrices, requiring precise intracellular post-translational modifications for proper function. Among the modifications, prolyl 4-hydroxylation is critical to stabilise the collagen triple helix. In humans, this reaction is mediated by collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs). While humans possess three genes encoding these enzymes (P4Hs), Drosophila melanogaster harbour at least 26 candidates for collagen P4Hs despite its simple genome, and it is poorly understood which of them are actually working on collagen in the fly. In this study, we addressed this question by carrying out thorough bioinformatic and biochemical analyses. We demonstrate that among the 26 potential collagen P4Hs, PH4EFB shares the highest homology with vertebrate collagen P4Hs. Furthermore, while collagen P4Hs and their substrates must exist in the same cells, our transcriptomic analyses at the tissue and single cell levels showed a global co-expression of PH4EFB but not the other P4H-related genes with the collagen IV genes. Moreover, expression of PH4EFB during embryogenesis was found to precede that of collagen IV, presumably enabling efficient collagen modification by PH4EFB. Finally, biochemical assays confirm that PH4EFB binds collagen, supporting its direct role in collagen IV modification. Collectively, we identify PH4EFB as the primary and potentially constitutive prolyl 4-hydroxylase responsible for collagen IV biosynthesis in Drosophila. Our findings highlight the remarkably simple nature of Drosophila collagen IV biosynthesis, which may serve as a blueprint for defining the minimal requirements for collagen engineering.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the role of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TS) in regulating competing valence-based behaviors and learning. TS dopamine dynamics were monitored as mice performed a classical conditioning task in which an odor cue predicted either an aversive air puff or a water reward. Initially, mice exhibited anticipatory blinking, which diminished over time, while anticipatory licking emerged later, coinciding with adaptation to the air puff. Dopamine responses in the TS to the air puff and its associated odor were initially elevated but declined with repeated exposure. Optogenetic disruption of this decline suppressed adaptation and hindered appetitive learning. These findings demonstrate that TS dopamine dynamics are essential for behavioral adaptation to aversive stimuli, which indirectly facilitates appetitive learning, underscoring a regulatory mechanism for shifting between defensive and reward-seeking behaviors.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

While SSA+ cases can be detected via serological testing, current assays lack specificity. For SSA- patients, no non-invasive diagnostic tools exist, and diagnosis often requires invasive lip biopsy. A saliva-based liquid biopsy capable of diagnosing both subtypes is therefore of high clinical interest. However, saliva poses challenges due to its abundant oral microbiome, which complicates unbiased biomarker discovery. In this study, we present a novel RNA sequencing workflow that efficiently depletes microbial content, enabling deep profiling of long RNAs within salivary extracellular vesicles (EVs). This approach identified both known and novel RNA biomarkers capable of diagnosing SSA+ and SSA- subtypes with high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, we uncovered distinct RNA signatures that allow molecular stratification of Sjogrens subtypes. Pathway analysis in SSA+ cases revealed enrichment of immune and glandular pathways consistent with prior tissue-based studies, supporting the utility of salivary EVs as a non-invasive surrogate for tissue biopsy. Importantly, our data provides new molecular insights into the under-characterized SSA- subtype, laying the foundation for future mechanistic studies and facilitating their broader inclusion in clinical trials.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

There is a shortage of information concerning the awareness of these para-veterinary workers regarding tick control and management. This study aims to bridge this critical knowledge gap by conducting a cross-sectional survey that evaluates the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of para-veterinary workers about tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in Pakistan. Between March and August 2023, we conducted a web-based survey among para-veterinary workers recruited via email, text message, and face-to-face conversations. Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores related to TBDs. We received 118 responses from three provinces; only 27.9% (n = 33) responded that they had attended workshops related to ticks and TBDs. Attending workshops was associated with higher KAP scores. All section scores were correlated, and higher knowledge scores were significantly associated with lower odds of tick exposure. Our findings suggest that workshop attendance is important in increasing overall awareness and promoting better practices regarding TBDs.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) assays revealed that 6-BA exhibits a higher binding affinity to the CHASE domain of the cytokinin receptor Arabidopsis HK4 (AHK4CD) compared to 2iP. Molecular docking and phylogenetic analyses further confirmed this finding and identified conserved key residues responsible for cytokinin binding across diverse plant species. Intriugingly, despite differences in pocket structure and binding energy, the cytokinin receptor in the bryophyte Marchantia polymorpha retains the capacity to bind cytokinins and respond to exogenous applications. Similarly, one cytokinin receptor in the monocots Oryza sativa exhibits distinct features in its cytokinin-binding pocket while still maintaining its ability to bind cytokinins. Our results thus provide fresh quantitative evidence for cytokinin receptor selectivity and highlight the structural plasticity of cytokinin perception, offering a foundation for designing optimized cytokinins or their receptors in crops.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Multicellularity is required for cell differentiation and, as such, is critical to the emergence of biological complexity. Here, we propose and find support for our hypothesis that multicellularity facilitated massive expansions in the biosynthetic potential to produce specialized metabolites across microbial life. Our systematic characterization of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) across bacteria confirms that most taxa have limited predicted potential to produce natural products. In contrast with primarily unicellular lineages, we show that the origins of biosynthetic expansion in Actinomycetota, Cyanobacteriota, and Myxococcota coincide with independent origins of multicellular structures such as mycelia, filaments, and fruiting bodies. Further, we reveal that the two primary origins of expansions in specialized metabolism for fungi, corresponding to the Pezizomycotina and Agaricomycetes, similarly coincide with the emergence of complex multicellularity and fruiting body formation as well as mechanisms for self-identification during haplontic life cycles. Interestingly, all five of the biosynthetically talented multicellular microbial lineages are concomitantly enriched in carbohydrate utilization enzymes, suggesting that ancient chemical innovations have been further shaped by catabolic processes. Intraspecific cooperation shaping the evolution of specialized metabolism further informs our understanding of the major transitions in life and will help guide efforts to discover new antimicrobial compounds to counter the emergence of antibiotic resistance.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

SORL1's cargo includes APP and A{beta}, which may explain why protein-truncating genetic variants (PTVs) in SORL1 are observed almost exclusively in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients, and that rare, predicted pathogenic missense variants have been associated with a 10-fold increased risk of AD. However, functional evidence supporting variant pathogenicity is warranted. Here we investigated whether soluble SORL1 (sSORL1) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) offer a potential in vivo biomarker to support impaired SORL1 function in variant carriers. Methods: Using an ELISA assay for SORL1 (ABCAM), we determined sSORL1 concentrations in CSF from 218 participants of the Alzheimer Dementia Cohort (ADC) (54% females). We compared sSORLA in CSF derived from 90 carriers of diverse SORL1 variants with concentrations observed in 78 SORL1-WT AD patients, and 50 SORL1-WT controls for whom CSF-pTau-181, CSF-tTau, CSF-A{beta}42 concentrations were available. In a subset of 36 individuals, we used Western blotting (WB) to validate sSORL1 concentrations as determined by ELISA. Results: CSF-sSORL1 concentrations did not differ between SORL1-WT AD patients and controls. While CSF-sSORL1 did not correlate with CSF-A{beta}42 concentrations in SORL1-WT AD patients (p=0.62), it correlated with sCSF-ptau-181 (p=9.7x10-6). The mean CSF-sSORL1 concentration in the SORL1 WT AD cases and controls was 466 pg/ml, with wide variance (SD = 133). Comparatively, concentrations were significantly lower in PTV carriers (260 pg/ml, p=3.2x10-7) and in carriers of predicted damaging SORL1 missense variants (323 pg/ml, p=2.4x10-7). CSF-sSORL1 concentrations measured by ELISA correlated strongly with concentrations estimated by WB ({rho} =0.552; p=5.0x10-4). Conclusion: CSF-sSORL1 increases with CSF-ptau, suggesting that increased SORL1-retromer activity may serve to rescue cellular stress associated with AD-related processes. However, impairing SORL1 genetic variants may preclude SORL1 trafficking to the cell surface, as supported by lower CSF-sSORL1 protein concentrations in carriers. While further refinements are necessary, we present first evidence for the applicability of ELISA-based quantification of sSORL1 in CSF to evaluate the functional impact of rare SORL1 variants.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

The function of these cells from the early development to maturity is critically dependent on the orchestrated expression of coding and non-coding genes. For example, in the stem cells the miR-290-295 cluster constitutes the majority of expressed microRNAs and is critical for stemness in rodents. During development towards various terminally differentiated lineages, such as neurons, the cells typically switch off transcription of these stem cell-specific microRNAs. Here we report that within the adult substantia nigra pars compacta (SN), the miR-290-295 cluster is exclusively expressed in DA neurons (SNDA), preventing the locomotor deficits and maintaining an adequate expression of enzymes involved in DA biogenesis, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and DA transporter (DAT). Importantly, a global knock-out of the miR-290-295 cluster leads to decreased numbers of SNDA neurons in adult mice. Using in vitro and in vivo DA cell-specific loss-of-function models, we demonstrated that miR-292a-3p, the most abundant microRNA in this cluster, directly targets Pten, a phosphatase antagonizing the neuroprotective phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) pathways regulating translation initiation. Mechanistically, when labelled with the click chemistry-compatible methionine analogue L-azidohomoalanine, miR-290-295 cluster-deficient SNDA neurons revealed a drastic impairment of protein synthesis, which is critical for DA biogenesis. Our surprising finding demonstrates for the first time a selective expression of stem cell-specific and stemness-promoting microRNAs in a distinct population of mature neurons to maintain their physiological functions in the adulthood, suggesting that similar epigenetic disinhibition mechanisms may be also critical for other terminally differentiated cells across species.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

As a result, producer cells are exposed to a chemically (nutrients, gas exchange, target protein overexpression) and physically (shear due to mixing) stressful environment, which can lead to loss of proteostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In response, cells activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR includes activation of autophagy and proteasomes, both of which target unfolded/misfolded proteins for degradation. To investigate the impacts of autophagy and proteasome activity on secreted protein production in ER-stressed cells, we used HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected to express Gaussia luciferase (as a model for therapeutic protein production) and exposed to tunicamycin (TM) (to activate ER stress). As expected, TM exposure decreased protein production and secretion. Inhibiting autophagy improved secretion in stressed cells as expected. However, counterintuitively, increasing proteasomal degradation improved secretion while inhibiting proteasomal activity decreased secretion, that is proteasomal activity was directly correlated to secretion. Taken together, our results demonstrate that protein secretion can be improved through control of autophagy and proteasomal activity, providing insight into strategies for improving yield from protein production bioprocesses.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

This study aims to identify a median estimator that is unbiased. To derive the unbiased median estimator, we minimized the sum of residuals raised to a rational power approaching one. We compared the properties of the unbiased and conventional medians using Poisson-distributed datasets. Random samples were generated with the Mersenne Twister algorithm implemented in IgorPro software (WaveMetrics Inc., Oregon). For odd sample sizes, the unbiased median coincides with the conventional median (the middle value). For even sample sizes, the unbiased median is defined as the value that equalizes the product of distances to data points above and below it--a definition that differs from the conventional median in asymmetric distributions. Although both median estimators tend to underestimate the mean of Poisson-distributed data, the unbiased median is consistently closer to the expected value. Additionally, the unbiased median exhibits lower variance compared to the conventional median.

J.; Krasensky-Wrzaczek, J.; Perez Guillen, A.; Wrzaczek, M.", "abstract": "Timely flowering is critical for the reproductive success of plants. Plants adjust flowering time through integration of multiple internal and environmental cues. A complex signalling system lies behind this integration, including multiple proteins like the GLYCINE-RICH RNA-BINDING PROTEIN 7 (GRP7), linked to the modulation of stress and flowering in Arabidopsis. Available data show the interaction between GRP7 and the receptor-like kinase CYSTEINE-RICH RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 2 (CRK2). Like GRP7, CRK2 plays multifaceted roles in the coordination of stress responses and development, but its role in development remains unclear. Phenotypic analyses of the crk2 and grp7-1 single mutants as well as the crk2/grp7-1 double mutant supported the interaction between CRK2 and GRP7. Moreover, exogenous gibberellic acid did not recover the rosette phenotype of crk2 mutants but as in sensitive plants, inhibited GA-biosynthesis transcripts. The pseudo insensitivity of crk2 mutant was recovered in the crk2/grp7-1 line pointing to a common role of CRK2 and GRP7 in the modulation of gibberellin signalling. Together, CRK2 and GRP7 integrate hormonal and spatial signals required for floral transition. These insights highlight a previously unrecognized layer of regulation in GA signalling and open new avenues to understand how membrane-localized kinases and RNA-binding proteins intersect to control developmental timing.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

To better understand the cold tolerance of this winter-active stonefly, we collected adult A. pygmaea in Antigonish, NS during March or April in both 2023 and 2024. Following different cold exposures, we measured the lower limits of activity (-8.9 {degrees}C) and the temperature at which internal freezing occurs (-11.9 {degrees}C), and confirmed that A. pygmaea could survive subzero temperatures unless they froze. We also assayed the following putative cryoprotectants: proline, glycerol, myo-inositol, trehalose, and glucose in control (field-collected) and cold-shocked groups. We detected little effect of cold shock on most cryoprotectants, except for the polyols glycerol and myo-inositol, which decreased in concentration following cold shock.

Several microglial features are poorly conserved between mice and human, such as the function of the neurodegeneration-associated immune receptor Trem2. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia offer a powerful opportunity to generate and study human microglia. However, human iPSC-derived microglia often exhibit activated phenotypes in vitro, and assessing their impact on other brain cell types remains challenging due to limitations in current co-culture systems. Here, we developed fully defined brain microtissues, composed of human iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, co-cultured in 2D or 3D formats. Our microtissues are stable and self-sufficient over time, requiring no exogenous cytokines or growth factors. All three cell types exhibit morphologies characteristic of their in vivo environment and show functional properties. Co-cultured microglia develop more homeostatic phenotypes compared to microglia exposed to exogenous cytokines. Hence, these tri-cultures provide a unique approach to investigate cell-cell interactions between brain cell types. We found that astrocytes and not neurons are sufficient for microglial survival and maturation, and that astrocyte-derived M-CSF is essential for microglial survival. Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses nominated a network of reciprocal communication between cell types.

We found robust neuronal representation of salient behavioral outcomes (correct vs. incorrect) which closely correlated with the monkeys' learning behavior.

Evidence of stimulation-locked neural changes would enable closed-loop application of TUS, but such responses have not yet been clearly dissociated from the coincident neural response to auditory and peripheral stimulation associated with TUS. We leveraged the contralateral retinotopic organization of the early visual cortex to isolate online TUS effects from peripheral confounds in 19 subjects. Using a hemifield visual stimulation paradigm combined with high-precision, functional MRI guided TUS, we applied TUS to the left early visual cortex while participants viewed checkerboards presented in the left or right visual field. TUS was delivered randomly on half of the trials, enabling within-subject comparisons of pattern-locked visual evoked potentials (VEPs) across hemispheres and against no stimuli. We observed a reduction in VEPs in the contralateral, but not ipsilateral, hemifield, consistent with genuine online neuromodulatory effects. Furthermore, online suppression was positively correlated with the TUS dose delivered to the target, as estimated by modelling TUS field-target overlap and differential attenuation through heterogeneous skulls. Collectively, these findings provide a robust framework for future studies aiming to map the TUS parameter space in real time by leveraging topographic organization to control for peripheral confounds.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Although larvae do not replace lost structures, juveniles and adults regenerate posteriorly following metamorphosis. To determine whether metamorphosis enables juveniles to regrow structures lost as larvae, we amputated C. teleta larvae, removing posterior segments, the hindgut, posterior growth zone, anus, and pygidium. Metamorphosis was then induced in these amputated larvae and reared as juveniles for 3-, 7-, or 14-days. New growth in juveniles was assessed by confocal microscopy, EdU staining, immunohistochemistry, and nuclear staining. A pgz and new segments were observed by 7 days post metamorphosis. Morphallaxis of the digestive system in preexisting tissue was also observed. In addition, re-amputation of juveniles resulted in regeneration of the pgz, segments, and hindgut.

Here, we combined computational screening, biochemical and cell-based phenotypic assays that support T. cruzi IMPDH (TcIMPDH) as a druggable target and identify repurposing opportunities among clinical-stage inhibitors. Using Tanimoto similarity scoring against the library of 222 Chagas Box compounds, we identified TCMDC-143376 as uniquely similar to the clinical IMPDH inhibitors Merimepodib and AVN-944. Phylogenetic analysis and multiple sequence alignment confirmed conservation of both catalytic and allosteric residues-drawn from T. foetus and T. brucei structures-within TcIMPDH.

This is partly mediated by the Warburg effect, whereby glucose is converted into ATP and a subset of these anabolic substrates. Concurrently, mitochondrial mass and ATP production decline in most tumors. This raises the question of how increased supplies of glycolysis-derived anabolic substrates can be balanced with those generated by the TCA cycle. Using primary murine liver cancers and cell lines, we show that this can be explained by the dissociation of mitochondrial Complex V (CV or ATP synthase) into its component and functionally-independent Fo and F1 domains. This occurs as a result of marked reductions in MT-ATP6, a CV subunit that stabilizes the Fo-F1 association. Serving as a proton pore, Fo maintains a normal mitochondrial membrane potential without generating ATP, thus allowing the TCA cycle, electron transport chain and anaplerotic reactions to function at high levels. Concurrently, free F1 functions as an ATPase to prevent excessive ATP accumulation. The uncoupling of TCA cycle-derived anabolic substrate production from membrane hyperpolarization and ATP synthesis by a smaller population of more efficient mitochondria allows TCA cycle-generated anabolic precursors to match those generated via glycolysis.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Thus, we explored whether oncogenic cooperation between regulatory germline variants and somatic driver mutations can help explain why some PCa patients develop a more aggressive phenotype, which may have implications for risk-adapted medical treatment. Here, by employing an integrative functional genomics approach, we identified receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase kappa (PTPRK) as a TMPRSS2::ERG (TE)-modulated gene associated with PCa progression whose expression is controlled by cooperation of the TE-fusion with a regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Analysis of available clinically annotated patient cohorts demonstrated that PTPRK is overexpressed in TE-positive PCa tumors and associated with higher Gleason scores and metastatic disease. TE knockdown in PCa cell lines reduced PTPRK expression, while ectopic overexpression of the fusion in TE-negative PCa cell lines and prostatic epithelium cells induced its expression. Functionally, PTPRK silencing inhibited cellular proliferation, cell cycle progression, and clonogenic growth of PCa cells, which was mirrored by dysregulation of corresponding gene and protein signatures in global transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic analyses after PTPRK knockdown. Analysis of TE ChIP-Seq and Hi-C data from PCa cells highlighted a proximal TE-bound DNA element whose TE-dependent enhancer activity was validated in reporter assays and which could be abrogated by a regulatory SNP.

Furthermore, neurovascular interactions cannot be studied, and disease phenotypes affecting vascular and neurovascular structures cannot be assessed. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we successfully incorporated a vascular network into midbrain organoids by fusion with vascular organoids. Midbrain-vascular assembloids are enriched in vascular cells and microglia. We observed a decrease in hypoxia and cell death in these assembloids. Furthermore, microglia and endothelial cells increased their morphological complexity. Assembloids derived from a Parkinsons disease patient carrying a LRRK2-G2019S mutation displayed a pro-inflammatory phenotype and altered electrophysiological properties.

While compartmental models have been used to examine microvascular blood perfusion using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), evidence on incoherent flows of CSF is emerging. This study aims to develop in vivo multi-dimensional MRI methods to investigate potential contributions of CSF in the IVIM regime. Method: T1-Diffusion (T1-D) and T2-Diffusion (T2-D) MRI data were acquired from 10 healthy subjects to investigate the relaxivity and diffusion signatures of incoherent fluid flows in the brain. Based on the T1-D and T2-D results, T1/T2 selective IVIM protocols were developed to map incoherent CSF flows in the human brains. Results: T1-D and T2-D MRI suggested incoherent CSF flow in the human brain subarachnoid space. Results from four different relaxation selective IVIM methods further supported incoherent CSF flows in these regions. Conclusion: We have shown the feasibility of using T1-D and T2-D MRI within the low b-value regime to probe the heterogeneity of IVIM components. Designed based on the 2D MRI spectra, relaxation selective 1D IVIM acquisition can be obtained within clinically feasible timeframe.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

In ERBs, evolutionary adaptations allow for fine-tuned discrete pro-inflammatory immune responses that control MARV infection, yet permit population-level viral maintenance. To look for exclusive co-adapted responses between ERBs and MARV, we compared macrophage (M{Phi}) responses to MARV and Sudan virus (SUDV), a related filovirus not hosted by ERBs. We queried whether MARV counters normal ERB M{Phi} responses, illuminating co-adapted host responses not observed upon infection with SUDV, which fails to establish a productive infection and is efficiently immunologically cleared by ERBs. We observed stark differences in M{Phi} transcriptional responses to MARV and SUDV, including differences in Type I and III interferon (IFN)-related genes, cytokines, chemokines, cell growth and proliferation genes. We show for the first time that while MARV-infected bat M{Phi}s undergo muted IFN responses and cytokine storm signalling, SUDV induces unperturbed Type I and III IFN gene expression, stronger cytokine and chemokine responses resembling typical host responses to a foreign viral pathogen. Our findings therefore corroborate growing evidence of unique coevolutionary relationships between bats and the specific viruses they harbor.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Moreover, the c10 treatment significantly increased the abundance of MGE intI1 indicative of horizontal gene transfer and ARG sul1 antibiotic resistance and significantly lowered radish biomass and nitrogen uptake, while spinach biomass and nitrogen uptake were unaffected. In summary, our study showed that antibiotic exposure significantly changed prokaryotic community diversity and taxonomy, while fungi remained largely unaffected.

Most, but not all, bacteria follow the \"Replicon Model\" for the initiation step: Their genomes encode an initiator and contain a replicator locus at which the initiator acts as activator. The single chromosomes of the model organisms E. coli and B. subtilis each contain one dnaA gene encoding the initiator protein DnaA, and one replication origin, oriC. The single chromosome of P. aeruginosa is the only exception known to date that contains two functional replication origins, oriC1 and oriC2. Since a preliminary study indicated that this unusual dual-origin configuration is also found in other Pseudomonadaceae, it seemed interesting to examine whether it can also be predicted for the Halomonadaceae, a sister clade of the Pseudomonadaceae. Here I show that of 163 Halomonadaceae genomes with an annotated dnaA gene, 23 have a single predicted origin, oriC2, and 138 have dual predicted origins, oriC1 and oriC2, with the genomic localizations of both corresponding to those in the P. aeruginosa genome. The distribution of species/strains with single or dual predicted oriCs in the taxogenomic tree of the Halomonadaceae suggests that a demise of oriC1 or its \"downgrading\" occurred repeatedly during their diversification.

Although auxin and BLADE-ON-PETIOLE (BOP) have been implicated as regulators of CYC, when, where, and how they affect CYC expression remains unclear. Here, we combined transgenic manipulation and fluorescent confocal imaging to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Mimulus parishii CYC genes (MpCYC2a and MpCYC2b) in relation to FM growth and auxin activity maxima in both wild type (WT) and bop mutants (mpbop). Strikingly, MpCYCs have already gained dorsal expression in the FM prior to any detectable auxin maxima, and no difference in MpCYC expression was observed between the wild type and mpbop during this initiation phase. We observed highly dynamic auxin maxima during FM expansion, when MpCYC expressions remained dorsally restricted in WT but expanded broadly in mpbop FMs. These findings suggest that early symmetry breaking in the FM is guided by positional cues independent of auxin or BOP, which are instead essential for refining and maintaining dorsal-specific CYC expression during later FM enlargement. Our work illustrated how combining advanced imaging with emerging model systems can yield fresh insights into long-standing questions in development and evolution, and laid the groundwork for further elucidating the mechanisms underlying the repeated symmetry breaking in FMs.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Increasingly, sub-Saharan Africa has become the focus of linear transportation infrastructure development that encroaches on many traditional wildlife areas. One of the resulting effects of infrastructure development, allowing people to move into areas they were not previously living in, can be human-wildlife conflict. This relationship between people, wildlife and infrastructure has not been well investigated in Kenya. We studied local people's perceptions of the impacts of the Mombasa to Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR), roads, oil pipelines and electricity transport lines on human-wildlife conflict in southern Kenya. Our results show that people's perceptions are that human wildlife conflict has increased in the past five years due to the construction of the SGR, but not in relation to other infrastructure. We have no independent data to check this result, and there is significant politics around this railway project, but the result is robust along 100s of kilometres of railway construction route.

Originally placed within the Euryarchaeota, they are now widely thought to belong to the DPANN archaea. However, the evolution of this clade and its phylogenetic placement within DPANN remain poorly understood. We applied phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses to assess the evolutionary relationship and genome evolution of the Nanohaloarchaeota and related DPANN lineages. Our phylogenetic analyses resolve Nanohaloarchaeota as a sister group to a phylum-level lineage referred to as EX4484-52, together forming a clade with Aenigmatarchaeota. Representatives of EX4484-52, for which we propose the name Caliditerrarchaeota, have an anaerobic, thermophilic lifestyle but do not appear to be adapted to high salt concentrations. Using gene tree-species tree reconciliations, we investigated the origin of halophily across these archaeal lineages revealing that adaptations to high-salt appear to have evolved on the branch to Nanohaloarchaeota after their divergence from Aenigmatarchaeota and Caliditerrarchaeota. In agreement with recent work, we also identify hallmarks of halophily in another order-level lineage within the Aenigmatarchaeota (Haloaenigmatarchaeaceae) which appears to represent a second independent adaptation of a DPANN clade to halophily. The two halophilic DPANN lineages are inferred to have distinct sets of proteins that enable them to live in environments with high salt levels. Notably, phylogenetic analyses reveal a dominant signal of gene transfers between Haloaenigmatarchaeaceae and Halarchaeoplasmatales, indicating a potential host-symbiont relationship.

To move beyond laboratory-based studies of the effect of individual stressors on model species, landscape transcriptomics - the study of how genome-wide expression patterns reveal environmental conditions - has been suggested. Here, we apply landscape transcriptomics to the damselfish Chrysiptera cyanea, a sentinel species from the coastal ecosystems of Okinawa, by sampling juveniles and adults across 18 sites from natural to urbanized habitats. We uncover a striking molecular signature of urbanization: fish from human-impacted sites exhibit elevated expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune responses. Remarkably, their transcriptomes resemble those of overfed individuals from laboratory feeding experiments - suggesting that urban reefs act as fast food environments, offering energy-rich diets while imposing chronic stress. This pattern is illustrated by the altered expression of key genes in metabolic and stress pathways (e.g., downregulation of ppargc1a and insrb, indicative of dietary intake surplus and insulin resistance; upregulation of interleukins, chemokines, toll-like receptors and caspase linked to the immune response and inflammation). Our results demonstrate that wild transcriptomes capture the invisible biological costs of environmental degradation, positioning fish as living biosensors for coastal ecosystem health.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

In this study, we set out to identify the chloroplast retrograde signals that regulate intercellular trafficking via PD.

A.; Bezvoda, R.; Cvrckova, F.", "abstract": "Background. The plant vacuole arises by orchestrated interplay of membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal rearrangements and a variety of signalling pathways. In the root, the characteristic large central vacuole develops by endomembrane reorganization occurring mainly in the transition zone. The vacuole's bounding membrane - the tonoplast - can be visualized in vivo using fluorescent protein markers, allowing for quantitative analysis of confocal microscopy images. Tonoplast organization can thus serve as a sensitive indicator of changes to any of the processes involved in vacuole biogenesis. The Vacuolar Morphology Index (VMI) is widely accepted as a quantitative measure of vacuole structure. However, this metric has two drawbacks - it only reflects the size of the largest vacuolar compartment (missing therefore possible differences in the organization of smaller compartments), and its determination is labor intensive, limiting its use on large datasets. Results. We developed an alternative metric for describing vacuole organization, named the Tonoplast Topology Index (TTI), which overcomes the above-mentioned shortcomings of the VMI. We compared the performance of our protocol with VMI on a simulated dataset and on real data. To validate the methods' performance, we used it to confirm the previously reported differences in vacuole shape and size between Arabidopsis thaliana roots grown on the surface of an agar medium compared to those embedded inside the agar. Both VMI and TTI could efficiently detect the relatively subtle changes in vacuole organization depending on the position of the root in the agar, and provided correlated results. However, only TTI produced data with close to normal value distribution, simplifying subsequent statistical evaluation. Conclusions. We present the protocol for TTI determination as a two-stage semi-automated procedure involving microscopic image analysis employing an ImageJ macro and subsequent processing of numeric data in the Jupyter Notebook environment, together with benchmarking image data. Since this implementation is freeware-based, platform-independent and (relatively) user-friendly, we hope it will find its use as a high throughput, added value alternative to the VMI metric.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Efforts are underway to convert potato to a diploid inbred-hybrid crop that is amenable to additional breeding strategies and allows breeders to more quickly respond to demands for crop improvement. With the goal of preserving haplotypes developed over the last 200 years of selection, diploid potato breeding in the US started with the creation of diploids from tetraploid commercial varieties and advanced breeding lines through prickle pollination. This is an effective but slow method which presents a barrier to entry for individual breeding programs. Therefore, we developed 97 publicly available dihaploids (diploids from prickle pollination of tetraploids) as a resource for diploid breeding in the U.S. These clones contain the majority of alleles in the US breeding population for three market classes: chips, russets, and fresh market reds. To facilitate genomic informed breeding, all clones have been resequenced using short read sequencing technology, and we have developed de novo assemblies based on PacBio HiFi long reads for 20 individuals. As an illustration of how these data will be used in breeding, we explored the maturity locus (StCDF1) and identified 15 different alleles. The majority of dihaploids were heterozygous for early and late alleles, resulting in intermediate maturity. Beyond informing breeding, this data facilitates investigations into potato genomics. The dihaploid population is both highly heterozygous and incredibly diverse on a population level. In particular, there is extensive structural diversity, including copy number variation, segregating within the population. This contrasts with a relatively low genome-wide historical recombination rate (<italic/>).

The A. mantegazzianus landrace (G11) was highly stable but low yielding. Amaranth genotypes showed distinct responses to drought, with some lines exhibiting broad adaptation and others, specific adaptation to stress-prone environments.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

In a novel experimental field setup with controlled attacks on clonal trees, we investigated the molecular defense responses of 35-year-old Norway spruce trees to colonization attempts by the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus. A multi-omics approach was used to study tree responses to bark beetle pioneers under natural conditions. At the site of the attacks, increased levels in jasmonic acid, together with changes in other phytohormones, induced differential gene expression of up to 1,900 genes from multiple defense-related pathways. These transcriptomic alternations were corroborated by proteomic and metabolomic shifts, which ultimately showed increased levels of compounds involved in deterring bark beetle attacks, such as phenolic aglycones, diterpene resin acids, mono- and sesquiterpenes, and lignin. Our study highlights the intricate yet rapid and effective local defense response of Norway spruce against pioneer bark beetle attacks and lays a foundation for in-depth studies of this and other conifers resistance to phloem-feeding insects", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

To enable sustainable plant-based production of these compounds, we established a transient expression procedure to enhance the biosynthetic flux in Nicotiana benthamiana toward dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), a substrate for isopentenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) that generate irregular monoterpene skeletons. Considering the benefits of glycosylation for accumulating and storing monoterpenes in extractable form, we focused on developing a platform for production of non-volatile glycosylated irregular monoterpenes using three IDS that form branched and cyclic structures. The analysis of methanolic leaf extracts from transiently transformed N. benthamiana plants revealed six major new components, 6-O-malonyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 6-O-malonyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1,2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside derivatives of chrysanthemol, lavandulol and cyclolavandulol, five of which are novel compounds. Alleviating two bottlenecks in the DMAPP formation in plastids by co-expressing 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase and isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases increased the yield of chrysantemyl and lavandulyl glucosides produced by plant-derived IDS to 1.7 {+/-} 0.4 mcmol g-1 FW and 1.4 {+/-} 0.3 mcmol g-1 FW, respectively. A bacterial cyclolavandulyl diphosphate synthase operated efficiently in chloroplasts and cytoplasm. The highest irregular monoterpene concentrations were achieved in cytoplasm by co-expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the bottleneck enzyme of the mevalonate pathway for DMAPP biosynthesis. The mean level of cyclolavandulyl glucosides reached 3.9 {+/-} 1.5 mcmol g-1 FW; the top-performing plants contained 6.6 mcmol g-1 FW.

While secondary wall xylan has been extensively characterised, the structure of xylan in primary walls remains less well understood, particularly in gymnosperms. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterised {beta}-1,2-linked xylosyl side chain in conifer and Arabidopsis thaliana xylan. Using enzymatic fingerprinting, NMR, and mass spectrometry, we show that this structure is positioned two xylose residues away from glucuronic acid substitutions, forming an evenly patterned substituted xylan. This spacing pattern is consistent with xylan-cellulose interaction, suggesting a structural role in primary wall architecture. This modification, found in primary wall-rich tissues of diverse conifer species, including needles and pro-embryogenic mass (PEM), is also present in Arabidopsis callus. We demonstrate that conifer Group III GT61 glycosyltransferases introduce this modification with consistent positional specificity. In Arabidopsis, three closely related GT61 enzymes act redundantly to generate the same structure, and their combined loss results in its complete absence.

For this purpose, we selected structural components of the cell recognised by specific molecular probes, which are molecules involved in rapid spatial cellular rearrangements: hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, xylan, and pectic compounds. Methods Using basic molecular techniques, we identified the transformations occurring within the cell and elucidated the mechanism triggered by growth in the absence of water. Results Our general observations are as follows: 1) remodelling of the cell wall after just 5 days of drought conditions; 2) organ-specific responses for drought resistance; 3) drought triggers the aggregation or cross-linking of molecules in the cell wall (appearance of larger molecular mass fractions) and causes degradation or breakdown of cell wall components (appearance of low molecular masses); 4) changes in the elemental economy due to modifications in cellular assembly. Conclusion Our finding of the deposition of un- and esterified homogalacturonans (HGs) and AGPs indicates reconstruction of cell wall as a means of prevention of drought effects. A stress-induced higher level of unesterified HGs permits calcium cross-linking, which enhances cell wall rigidity and helps in intracellular water preservation.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

While 3D printing artificial substrates has been explored to mimic the physical structure of soil, it remains unclear which design parameters are critical for supporting full plant development. Here, we present a synthetic, soilless substrate based on 3D-printed hydrogels incorporating triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) patterns to create internal air-filled channels. These channels remain in contact with the atmosphere, enabling passive gas exchange throughout the substrate. We tested five TPMS geometries (Lidinoid, Split-P, Schwarz-D, Schwarz-P, and Schoen), each with an identical hydrogel volume but with different surface-to-volume ratios. Arabidopsis thaliana seeds germinated directly on the substrates and were monitored for vegetative and reproductive growth over five weeks. Among the designs, the Lidinoid substrate consistently led to the highest number and size of leaves and the earliest and most complete flowering, outperforming both hydroponics and unpatterned hydrogel controls. Our results indicate that the surface-to-volume ratio is a key parameter influencing substrate performance, likely due to its impact on oxygen availability at the root interface. Plants grown on substrates with higher surface areas transitioned to flowering more reliably and rapidly, with flowering efficiency showing a strong positive correlation with surface area. These findings suggest that vascular-like internal architectures can overcome the oxygen limitations of traditional hydroponic systems without requiring active aeration. This work supports the use of additive manufacturing as a powerful tool for engineering soil analogues tailored for indoor agriculture. By combining passive aeration with hydration and nutrient delivery, patterned hydrogels offer a promising, scalable solution for sustainable soilless plant cultivation.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

While numerous light-inducible CRY-binding proteins have been identified, the structural basis for photoactivated CRY-effector assembly remains poorly understood. Here we report the crystal structure of a constitutively active maize CRY1c photolyase homology region (ZmCRY1c-PHRW368A) in complex with ZmGL2, a BAHD ptotein directing very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) elongation for cuticular wax biosynthesis. Structural analysis reveals that light-activated ZmCRY1c forms a homotetrameric scaffold generating four symmetric binding sites at subunit interfaces. Each ZmCRY1c protomer engages one ZmGL2 molecule through conformational reorganization of its 16-17 loop and 17 helix, establishing a 4:4 hetero-octameric photosignaling complex validated by mutational profiling and optical design. Remarkably, structural alignment with the ZmCER6-ZmGL2 complex reveals substantial overlap (78%) in ZmGL2 binding interfaces. Biochemical quantification demonstrates that ZmCRY1c suppresses ZmCER6-GL2 enzyme activity in a dose dependent manner, unveiling a light-dependent regulatory switch controlling VLCFA elongation efficiency, though in vivo physiological investigation is awaited. Collectively, our work not only establishes the atomic model of light-activated plant CRY-effector assembly, but also uncovers a previously unrecognized spatial competition between photoreceptor and metabolic enzyme complexes that might function as a photoregulatory paradigm in cuticular wax biosynthesis.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

To investigate the genetic basis of species-specific courtship, we generated hybrid males by crossing two Drosophila melanogaster strains with D. simulans Lhr males. This design allowed us to assess how genetic background and female species identity influence male courtship behavior. In both single-pair and mate-choice assays, hybrid males displayed behavioral plasticity, adjusting their courtship strategies based on the female species. The maternal D. melanogaster strain significantly shaped hybrid behavioral repertoires. To identify the neural correlates, we examined fruitless (fru)-expressing neurons in hybrids. Their projection patterns resembled those in D. melanogaster, indicating conserved circuit architecture. Using CUT&Tag, we identified FruM target genes in both species, revealing conserved core and species-specific FruM targets. Focusing on chemosensory receptors with D. melanogaster-specific FruM binding, we conducted a genetic screen in D. melanogaster, silencing neurons co-expressing fru P1 and specific receptor genes. Courtship preference assays identified three additional olfactory receptor neuron subtypes that modulate species-specific behavior.

However, traditional polygenic risk score (PRS) methods rely on simplified phenotype definitions or predefined trait sets, limiting their ability to represent the intricate phenotypic structures embedded within EHRs. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework, EEPRS, that leverages phenotype embeddings derived from EHRs to improve genetic risk prediction using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, enabling accurate, robust and interpretable risk prediction for a wide range of diseases. Employing embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GPT, we conducted EHR embedding-based GWAS and identified a distinct cardiovascular cluster via hierarchical clustering of genetic correlations. Across 41 clinical traits in the UK Biobank, our EEPRS framework consistently outperformed traditional single-trait PRS, particularly within this identified cluster. Validation using PRS-based phenome-wide association studies (PRS-PheWAS) further confirmed robust associations between EHR embedding-based PRS and circulatory system diseases. Furthermore, our data-adaptive method, EEPRS_optimal, employing cross-validation to select the best embedding method, leading to additional improvements in prediction. We further developed MTAG_EEPRS for multi-trait PRS, resulting in averaging 92.48% improvement in R2 for continuous traits and 24.06% in AUC for binary traits compared to single-trait PRS. Overall, EEPRS represents a robust and interpretable framework, enhancing genetic prediction accuracy through integrating EHR embeddings with single-trait and multi-trait PRS.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

M.; Zhang, B.", "abstract": "Technological advances in chromatin structure characterization have continually refined our understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic systems. Despite these developments, achieving nucleosome-resolution structural characterization remains a significant challenge. As a result, it remains unclear what structural features distinguish active enhancers and promoters and how these elements are organized. To address this, we developed a simulation framework that leverages high-resolution Region-Capture Micro-C (RCMC) contact maps to infer conformational ensembles of megabase-scale chromatin segments at nucleosome resolution. A key component of this framework is a balancing strategy tailored for Micro-C data, which identifies per-nucleosome variation in contact density, in contrast to existing methods that assume uniform contact density. Our model accurately reproduces contact frequencies observed in RCMC data, pairwise spatial distances measured via chromatin tracing, and local structural motifs observed in imaging studies. The high spatial and genomic resolution of the inferred structures reveal a striking departure from the classical view of euchromatin as uniformly open. Instead, euchromatin generally folds into compact domains, consistent with the \"packing domains\" observed in imaging studies. These domains are further organized into disordered, insulated clusters of approximately 50 nucleosomes, resembling nucleosome clutches. Notably, kilobase-scale regions surrounding active promoters and enhancers often protrude from these condensed domains, becoming highly accessible. This spatial arrangement effectively compartmentalizes regulatory elements from the surrounding chromatin, facilitating protein binding and promoting enhancer-promoter communication. The distinct structural features of euchromatin revealed here offer new insights into enhancer regulation and may help explain their enigmatic behavior.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Despite its potential relevance to modern human diets and lifestyles, the mechanisms and physiological relevance underlying DIT remain poorly understood. Here, we show that DIT reduces adiposity and protects against hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in males but not female mice. Moreover, adipose tissue-specific ablation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) reveals that BAT is the primary mediator of DIT but that non-adipocyte UCP1 also contributes to body weight regulation. Transcriptome analysis suggests that DIT is triggered by intrinsic metabolic stress, distinguishing it from CIT, which is driven by sympathetic tone.

The number and duration of GCB-Tfh interactions correlate with the success of the germinal center in effectively generating antibodies that can bind and neutralize antigens. Prior studies have shown that GCBs and Tfhs exploit distinct motility patterns to surveil the GC light zone and engage in these cell-cell interactions. However, the quantitative relationship between lymphocyte motility parameters (such as speed and tortuosity) and GCB-Tfh interactions has not been systematically explored. Here, we analyzed single-cell trajectories of GCBs and Tfhs from two-photon intravital microscopy videos of GCs within mouse popliteal lymph nodes. We found that these cells exhibit seven distinct motility behaviors, each with characteristic speeds and tortuosities. GCBs tended to move in slow and tortuous paths, while Tfhs adopted faster and more directed trajectories. We then developed a three-dimensional agent-based model (ABM) to simulate these experimentally-observed GCB and Tfh motility behaviors and predict their impact on GCB-Tfh interactions.

Disruption of parental care, for example through parental separation, can negatively affect offspring development in rodents. While previous work has focused on maternal and paternal deprivation, the effects of cross-fostering, another form of parental-offspring instability, on brain development remains unclear. Stress significantly suppresses neurogenesis and increases inflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus, with effects that vary between sexes. Given that degus (Octodon degus) are born precocial and form strong attachments with their parents early in life, this study aimed to investigate the effect of cross-fostering on hippocampal development in female and male degu pups. At postnatal day 8, degus were assigned to either control (pups remained with parents and littermates), partial cross-foster (one pup per litter was cross-fostered), or full cross-foster (the entire litter was cross-fostered) conditions. At weaning (5-weeks-old), offspring brains were collected for immunohistochemistry to examine dentate gyrus volume, density of pyknotic cells, density of immature neurons, and number and morphology of microglia. Both types of cross-fostering reduced hippocampal cell death in both sexes relative to controls, while no significant effects were observed in the dentate gyrus volume or density of immature neurons. Full cross-fostered pups, regardless of sex, had more microglia in the ventral dentate gyrus compared to controls. Full cross-fostered females had fewer amoeboid microglia compared to female controls. Together, these findings suggest that cross-fostering affects pup hippocampal development, however, the effects depend on type of cross-fostering, sex, and hippocampal region.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

However, the impact of Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL-1) binding in modulating LAG-3 mediated inhibition and its specific impact on CD28 costimulatory signaling remains unclear. This study investigates the role of LAG-3/FGL-1 interaction in modulating T cell activation. Using phosphoproteomics and confocal microscopy in LAG-3+ Jurkat cells, we demonstrated that LAG-3/FGL-1 interaction suppresses T cell activation by disrupting CD28-mediated recruitment of Lck, impairing its colocalization with CD28. Importantly, this inhibition occurs independently of CD4-bound Lck, indicating that LAG-3 ligand engagement targets both free and membrane-associated Lck pools.

J.", "abstract": "Cocaine use disorder is highly comorbid in people with HIV and can accelerate infection, alter neuropathology, and exacerbate cognitive decline despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Many of these effects are due to infection and dysregulation of CNS myeloid cells, especially microglia, which comprise a significant reservoir in this compartment. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which cocaine (Coc) enhances HIV infection in microglia are unclear, partly due to the lack of translationally relevant human microglial models suitable for mechanistic evaluation of Coc-mediated changes in viral dynamics. Canonically, Coc acts by blocking dopamine transporter activity, however, Coc has additional mechanisms beyond dopaminergic tone, involving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein sigma-1, which has diverse cellular functions, including modulation of stress pathways such as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Viruses, including HIV, can exploit the UPR to amplify stress-induced protein production in host cells, enhancing viral replication. Therefore, we hypothesized that Coc-mediated activation of sigma-1 increases HIV infection of microglia via activation of the UPR. Using human-induced pluripotent stem cell microglia (iPSC-Mg), we evaluated changes in the percentage of infected iMg as well as p24Gag secretion using high-content imaging and AlphaLISA. Coc increased both p24 secretion and the number of infected iMg. The enhanced p24 secretion persisted despite ART, without the corresponding increase in percent p24, suggesting Coc augments the post-entry steps of viral replication. Inhibition of dopamine receptors did not diminish the impact of Coc, but pharmacological inhibition and CRISPR KO of sigma-1 blocked the effect. Independently, sigma-1 agonists increased p24 secretion, suggesting that Coc acts through sigma-1 rather than dopaminergic pathways. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct transcriptomic alterations in HIV+Coc-treated iPSC-Mg. Further genetic and proteomic validation confirmed activation of the IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR in the HIV+Coc condition, with increased XBP1 signaling and downstream cytokine (IL-4 and IL-7) secretion. The HIV+Coc condition also showed reduced expression of antiviral response genes and enhanced HIV transcriptional regulation genes. Immunofluorescence staining showed increased sigma-1 in p24- cells and reduced sigma-1 in p24+ cells in HIV+Coc cultures and revealed that HIV+Coc promotes sigma-1 movement to the ER. These findings suggest that Coc exploits sigma-1 signaling to modulate the UPR, enhancing viral replication and immune evasion. Sigma-1 emerges as a critical link between HIV-induced cellular stress and cocaine exposure, highlighting a shared molecular pathway that can be leveraged for the treatment of comorbid HIV neuropathogenesis, substance use disorder, and related neuropsychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

These secondary extinctions often result from complex species interactions, making it difficult to identify the underlying mechanisms. Here, we leverage Modern Coexistence Theory to identify when and why secondary extinctions occur during community disassembly. To understand when secondary extinctions occur, we develop the Community Disassembly Graph, describing transitions between coexisting communities due to extinction through an invasion growth rate approach. Once a secondary extinction is identified on the Community Disassembly Graph, we decompose the invasion growth rates associated with the secondary extinction to understand why it occurs. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by applying it to models in which different species interactions -- competition, facilitation, and predation -- significantly contribute to coexistence, with their loss inducing secondary extinctions. Our results show that Modern Coexistence Theory offers a flexible and interpretable approach to understanding when and why secondary extinctions occur in ecological models.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

This compartment is composed of rare T cells that predominantly express memory and effector memory markers. The lack of precise understanding of the latent compartment has made it challenging to develop curative strategies for HIV-1 infection. Here we report on the properties of CD4+ T cells clones carrying intact latent proviruses, expanded in vitro from single cells obtained from the reservoir of people living with HIV-1. The latent proviruses in the clones were integrated into ZNF genes, non-genic satellite and centromeric regions, frequently associated with latency. Notably, the transcriptome of the cultured clones resembled their cells of origin. Despite their descent from single cells, only a fraction of the cells ranging from 0.4-14% expressed relatively low levels of HIV-1 that did not measurably alter host gene transcriptome. Latency reversing agents (LRAs) variably increased the number and amount of expression per cell, but the effects were modest and clone and LRA specific.

Using immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies, we show that MCM8/9 interacts with FANCD2 through its core domain, independently of DNA. FANCD2 is essential for the recruitment of MCM9 to ICL damage induced nuclear foci and acts downstream the FANCD2I monoubiquitination. Although MCM8/9 foci formation requires its intact ATPase activity, BRCv motif and HROB, these are not required for FANCD2 binding, highlighting a distinction between physical interaction and functional activation. Interestingly, FANCD2 foci formation increase in MCM8 or MCM9 knockout cells, suggesting that MCM8/9 functions to mitigate replication associate stress. {gamma}H2AX DNA damage assays and cell survival assays show that combined loss of MCM9 and FANCD2 do not cause any additive DNA damage beyond individual knockouts, indicating an epistatic relationship and suggests they function in the same DNA repair pathway.

BRD4 binding to Aurora B inhibits its kinase activity, preventing autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the key mitotic targets histone H3 and MCAK, the mitotic centromere associated kinesin. This inhibition is relieved during metaphase when JNK is activated and phosphorylates BRD4, triggering its transient release from chromatin. Importantly, Aurora B activity during mitosis inversely correlates with BRD4 binding and directly correlates with JNK activation and BRD4 release.

Tetherin plays an analogous role in retaining other extracellular particles, including many enveloped viruses and midbody remnants. In this study, we examine the molecular basis of exosome tethering and define the mechanisms underlying tetherin-mediated retention. Using a combination of biochemical, live-cell and ultrastructural imaging approaches, we show that tetherin homodimerisation is essential for exosome tethering.

Targeted chromocenter disruption in Drosophila testes subjected to natural and artificial mechanical stress compromises nuclear mechanostability, leading to deformed nuclei, DNA damage, and chromosome breaks. Conversely, enhancing chromocenter formation through genetic means improves mechanostability. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that chromocenters enable physically linked chromosomes to respond collectively, rather than individually, to mechanical challenge, and dissipate external forces over a larger nuclear surface.

TEX264 expression was increased by ER stress, which caused precocious cornification of organotypic epidermis. In undifferentiated keratinocytes, ectopic TEX264 was sufficient to fragment the ER, while in highly differentiated keratinocytes, it accelerated ER elimination and induced nuclear shrinkage; these effects were abolished by mutating the LC3 interacting region required for its autophagic function. Knockout of TEX264 or inhibiting its activation disrupted maturation of organotypic cultures, pointing to a critical role for reticulophagy in cornification. Finally, in patient biopsies and an organotypic model of Darier disease, a genetic cornification disorder linked to ER dysfunction, we found increased TEX264 in areas of premature cornification (dyskeratosis).

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled the identification of neo-sex chromosomes, created by the fission or fusion of autosomes with sex chromosomes, providing a new avenue to investigate the dynamics of sex chromosome evolution. Squamate reptiles, particularly Anolis lizards, are an excellent system for studying the consequences of sex-linkage due to their frequent sex chromosome-autosome fusions.

Yet the influence of environmental change can imprint in contemporary and historic DNA sequences, thereby offering clues about drivers of population dynamics. The Prince William Sound (PWS) stock of Pacific herring famously collapsed in the early 1990s following the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS), yet the causes of the collapse and reasons for a persistent lack of recovery are controversial. Three seasons after the spill, the PWS population declined precipitously, coincident with repeated disease outbreaks, and has remained small across the three decades since. We use population genetics as a forensic tool to gain insight into the causes and consequences of the collapse. We tracked genome-wide genetic variation across time, spanning the period immediately after the spill but preceding the collapse (1991) and across three subsequent decades to 2017. We compared genetic change through time between the PWS population and two reference Alaska populations. We detected high genetic differentiation between the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska, and relatively small but significant genetic structure within the Gulf of Alaska. No loss of genome-wide genetic diversity was observed in the PWS population after the collapse. We did not detect any evidence for selective sweeps at individual loci. However, using sensitive temporal covariance methods, we detected significant signatures of positive polygenic adaptation in the PWS population but not in either of the reference populations. Gene functional enrichment analysis is consistent with selection acting on immune function and pathways that regulate crude oil developmental toxicity in the period following the spill and collapse.

Linear mixed-effects models (MEMs) extend linear models to accommodate complex designs, such as longitudinal sampling or hierarchical study structures. However, when applied to microbiome data, existing MEM approaches suffer from high false positive and false negative rates because sequence counts are compositional -- they reflect relative rather than absolute abundances. Current methods attempt to overcome this limitation through normalization, but these approaches imply on strong, often unrealistic assumptions about the unmeasured biological scale (e.g., total microbial load). Here we introduce scale-reliant mixed-effects models (SR-MEM), which extend our earlier scale-reliant inference framework by explicitly modeling uncertainty in the unmeasured scale via user-defined probability distributions. By treating scale as a latent variable rather than fixing it through normalization, SR-MEM yields robust inference for complex experimental designs. Across simulations and real datasets, SR-MEM is the only method that consistently controls the false discovery rate while achieving higher power than both normalization and bias-correction methods. SR-MEM can also incorporate external scale measurements (e.g., flow cytometry, qPCR) or leverage independent studies to further improve inference.

Y.", "abstract": "Background: Patients with autosomal polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have an increased risk and worsened outcomes for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but the mechanism behind this is unknown. Polycystin 2 (PC2), the protein encoded by one of the two main genes mutated in ADPKD, is a calcium-permeant channel ubiquitously expressed; however, its role in cardiomyocytes remains poorly understood. One hallmark of AMI is ER stress, which PC2 is known to regulate adaptively; however, whether PC2 regulates ER stress in the ischemic heart is unknown. Objective: This study investigates the mechanism by which PC2 regulates ER stress in myocardial ischemia. Methods and Results: PC2 protein was increased in human ischemic heart failure samples and murine myocardial infarct samples, and it was enriched at ER-mitochondrial contact sites. Induction of myocardial infarction (MI) in cardiomyocyte-specific PC2-KO mice led to cardiac dysfunction and reduced PERK expression compared to control MI mice. ER stress induced by tunicamycin in vitro blunted PERK phosphorylation and subsequent CHOP upregulation in PC2 KO cells. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress resulted in a PC2-dependent ER calcium leak and mitochondrial calcium transients, along with increased mitochondrial function, all of which were decreased in PC2 KO cells. Moreover, PC2 KO cells after ER stress exhibited decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased apoptosis. Isolated WT cardiomyocytes exhibited increased diastolic calcium after acute ER stress induction and increased mitochondrial uptake, neither of which was seen in PC2 KO cells. Re-expression of full-length PC2 in vitro restored both the calcium leak and PERK phosphorylation in PC2 KO cells under ER stress, but not a pathological mutant PC2 D511V, which impairs ion channel activity. Conclusions: PC2 is upregulated during ER stress, where it localizes at ER-mitochondrial contact sites and acts as an ER calcium leak channel, thereby restoring cellular homeostasis during the adaptive phase of ER stress. PC2 provides cardioprotection during ischemic events by preventing maladaptive ER stress, which contributes to cardiac dysfunction.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

However, transcranial implementation in non-human primates remains challenging due to the skull's acoustic attenuation and distortion. This study presents a method for non-invasive transcranial ULM imaging of the anesthetized squirrel monkey through intact skull and skin. We systematically evaluated key ultrasound acquisition parameters and identified an optimal configuration balancing resolution, depth, and vascular representation. Using these refined parameters, we achieved a system resolution of 9.5 m, measured by Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC), and consistently visualized vessels as small as 23 m. Full-brain coronal and sagittal acquisitions revealed major vascular landmarks that were reproducible across animals and slices. Importantly, this resolution enables reliable detection of penetrating arterioles and venules, key elements in neurovascular coupling and implicated in various cerebrovascular pathologies. Finally, by tracking microbubbles, we quantified flow velocities from 8.8 to 55 mm/s, corresponding to flow rates ranging from 0.1 to 279 L/min, demonstrating the technique's ability to access micro- and macrovascular dynamics. This work establishes a framework for high-resolution, non-invasive brain imaging in non-human primates, and opens promising perspectives for studying cerebral structure, function, and dysfunction in translational neuroscience.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

While we might hope that 95% of the CIs would contain the meta-analytic mean value (and therefore presumably also the true value), a recent meta-analysis of 512 meta-analyses in ecology and evolution suggests that only a sobering 45% of them do. As this paradox of overconfidence continues to confuse researchers, we attempt to explain where most of the heterogeneity in findings might be coming from. On the one hand, heterogeneity is unsurprising because conventional 95% CIs refer only to the uncertainty due to sampling noise, but not to any other source of error such as arbitrary analysis decisions (\"model uncertainty\"). Being aware of multiple sources of error beyond sampling noise, the replication crisis logically follows from an anticonservative statistical practice that allows for overinterpretation beyond the legitimate inference space, which in fact is narrower than commonly acknowledged. We explain how to calculate extended confidence intervals (CIext) that also cover other sources of biological and analytical heterogeneity, and we clarify which CIext is valid for which extended inference space. We further show how multiple versions of analysis of the same dataset can be merged into a many-analyses meta-analysis (MAMA) which yields a CI that accounts for two sources of error. Yet, on the other hand, we also recognize that analysts which summarize multiple results (e.g. meta-analysis, multiverse analysis, many-analyst studies) will often find high levels of heterogeneity because they \"compare apples and oranges\" (either in terms of statistical metric or biological interpretation). Therefore, the estimate of only 45% deserved confidence appears far too pessimistic. Overall, we need considerable caution in interpreting both confidence intervals and estimates of heterogeneity, and we need to become better at keeping apples and oranges separated.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

To promote the optimization of breeding regimes carried out by industrial black soldier fly production plants, it is critical to better understand adult reproductive physiology and its potential relationship with fertile egg production. However, in this species, little is known about how reproductive morphology changes with respect to increases in body size, nor the potential impacts selection can have on the form of reproductive structures. Hence, this study investigated the nutritional static allometric relationship between the external genitalia of adult male black soldier flies and their body size. Size differences were induced top-down by varying larval rearing densities, which has a downstream effect on adult body size. For each rearing density, a random sample of 30 individuals was selected, and measurements taken three times each for the head, thorax, parameral sheath, and gonostylus. Fitting a generalized linear log-log model to the data revealed that for every 10.0% increase in body size (thorax length), genital length (parameral shealth) only increased by 1.8%. The resulting allometric slope of genitalia to thorax size was 0.195, indicating a pattern of hypoallometry. The presence of hypoallometric genitalia in a domestic population indicates individuals can copulate irregardless of differences in body size, which is consistent with most other insects. Moreover, it is likely that the ancestral population of black soldier flies historically underwent selection to maintain a single genitalia-size independent of body size that continues to persist in captivity. To confirm, future work should investigate the direct impacts of hypoallometric genitalia on fitness, especially in flies which have been genetically edited or artificially selected to be increasingly large.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Energy landscape analysis (ELA), based on the pairwise maximum entropy model, is a powerful framework to characterize brain activity as transitions among discrete states defined by regional activity patterns. However, traditional approaches require a predefined set of regions of interest (ROIs), usually chosen based on prior knowledge from hypothesis-driven studies, which introduces subjectivity and may overlook previously unknown patterns. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new ELA framework enhanced by automated ROI selection using genetic algorithm optimization, called ELA/GAopt. ELA/GAopt employs a genetic algorithm to select ROI subsets that maximize model fitting accuracy while accounting for individual variability. We applied ELA/GAopt to two independent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets. In Scenario 1, we tested how well the method generalizes using the Creativity dataset (OpenNeuro: ds002330), which includes 66 healthy adults (29 males, 36 females, and one non-binary individual; average age 26.6 {+/-} 4.3 years). ELA/GAopt was performed on a discovery set (n = 31), and the optimized ROI sets were validated on a test set (n = 30). Over 100 independent optimization runs, the selected ROI sets achieved significantly higher objective function values than randomly chosen ROI sets (permutation test, p < 0.05, false discovery-rate corrected). The similarity of local minimum states between discovery and test sets was also significantly higher for ELA/GAopt than for random selection (p < 0.05). These results confirm the reproducibility and generalizability of the proposed approach. In Scenarios 2-4, we analyzed data from 293 participants in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II dataset, including 157 with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 136 typically developing controls (CTL) from discovery cohort A and validated findings in an independent cohort (54 ASD and 72 CTL participants). ELA/GAopt showed that ASD participants tend to visit local minima characterized by global co-activation of selected ROIs, especially within sensory-motor and visual networks. Additionally, ROI sets optimized for one group (ASD or CTL) did not generalize across groups, with significant differences in the number and structure of local minima (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05, false discovery-rate corrected). These findings demonstrate that ELA/GAopt offers a robust, data-driven approach to modeling brain state dynamics, minimizing biases from predefined ROI selection. It improves reproducibility and could aid in discovering neuroimaging biomarkers for clinical conditions.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Although tau is present at synapses, its normal synaptic function is poorly understood - information vital to the rational development of tau-modifying therapies. Since rats have a greater cognitive repertoire than mice and display more robust signs of tau pathology in AD models, we developed a tau knockout (Mapt-/-) rat to investigate the impact of tau elimination on synaptic function. We observed that long-term depression (LTD), a form of synaptic weakening, is enhanced in the hippocampus of male, but not female, rats. This enhanced LTD was dependent on the synaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and involved altered synaptic actin polymerization. These studies therefore provide mechanistic insights into how tau modulates synaptic function via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

However, understanding of virulence and avirulence mechanisms in aphid-plant systems is currently limited. Here, we report discovery of an effector candidate family that is unique to aphids. Using functional genomics data on divergent pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) genotypes and their F1 progeny, we filtered for differentially expressed saliva proteins that co-segregated with virulence or avirulence phenotypes. LOC100575698 (ACPISUM_029930), annotated as an uncharacterized protein, was the sole candidate effector for which RNA-Seq and saliva proteomics data showed significantly different expression both between avirulent and virulent parents and between their segregating F1 progeny, with this gene upregulated in avirulent genotypes. BLASTP searches revealed multiple divergent homologs only in genomes of the Aphidomorpha infra-order, suggesting a hitherto undefined ancient aphid-specific gene family. AlphaFold models indicate strong structural similarities but weak sequence homology to chitinases. Because the aphid-specific clade all lack canonical DxxDxDxE motifs for catalytic activity, we designate the proteins as a novel CHitinase-Like (CHL) family. Association of ACPISUM_029930 (ApCHL1) with avirulence was further supported by co-segregating SNPs and a genotype-specific alternatively spliced isoform. We hypothesise that CHL proteins may function similarly to phylogenetically unrelated chitin-binding fungal effectors that sequester chitin, also present in aphid stylets, potentially preventing defence activation through plant chitin receptors and/or blocking chitin degradation by host-secreted chitinases.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Rockfishes (genus Sebastes) in the northeast Pacific Ocean are commonly parasitized by copepods in the genus Sarcotaces. These copepods form large cysts within the body cavity or in the musculature of individuals. There is a lack of baseline data on the prevalence of Sarcotaces sp. infection and the effect of infection on rockfish health and life history. Here, we present data on Sarcotaces sp. infection in rockfish species (including two thornyhead species, genus Sebastolobus) that includes over 37,000 individual records collected on Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Pacific Region) groundfish research surveys. Sarcotaces sp. were found in all geographic areas covered by the surveys (the coastal waters of British Columbia), and at all depths fish were encountered. Infection rates in the various species ranged from 0% to 10%, and were highest for Pacific Ocean Perch (POP), Silvergray, Rougheye/Blackspotted Complex (REBS), Yellowmouth, and Yelloweye rockfishes. We found that Sarcotaces sp. infection shifted the length-at-maturity ogive, with infected individuals maturing at larger sizes - particularly for males, who exhibited a 22.3 mm increase (95% CrI [credible interval]: 5.5, 39.8) in length-at-maturity across species. For most species, this effect was greater in males than in females, and the effect was most pronounced in POP, Silvergray, and REBS rockfish. Moreover, we found that immature males were 2.5 times more likely to be infected than mature males (95% CrI: 1.3, 4.7), and immature females were 1.7 times more likely to be infected than mature females (95% CrI: 0.9, 3.0). While speculative, this is consistent with Sarcotaces sp. infection acting as a co-morbidity, possibly affecting fish health and the probability of perishing before reaching maturity. Body condition was largely unrelated to infection status; however, a slight increase (~5%) in condition was associated with infection in REBS, Yelloweye, and Yellowmouth rockfishes. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale report on Sarcotaces sp. infection within rockfishes and on rockfish life-history traits.

Although the genetic basis of sexual trait has been investigated in diverse species, its evolutionary origin, evolutionary mode, and evolvability remain poorly understood. To address these issues, we investigated the strain-specific sexual dimorphism in elytral color patterns of the harlequin ladybug, Harmonia axyridis, a species with over 200 color morphs. The most basal Red-nSpots type color morph exhibits sexual dimorphism, whereas other derived color morphs have lost it. To investigate how this loss of sexual dimorphism is associated with the emergence of novel color morphs, we investigated the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism by focusing on the master sex differentiation gene, doublesex (dsx). We show that dsx regulates color pattern dimorphism by negatively modulating black spot size in males. This modulation is primarily mediated by the transcriptional regulation of the color patterning gene, h (Drosophila pannier ortholog). Intraspecific comparative ATAC-seq analysis of the pupal wings revealed that, at the h locus, not the absolute number of Dsx-binding motifs but the proportion of open chromatin regions containing Dsx-binding motifs relative to those lacking such motifs was reduced in strains that had lost sexual dimorphism and acquired novel color patterns, implying that sexual dimorphism evolves based on the balance between novel CREs and Dsx-binding motif density.

While early steps in the flavonoid pathway are broadly conserved across plant lineages, increasing evidence demonstrates lineage-specific evolutionary trajectories and functional diversification in its terminal branches, particularly in the case of LAR. To explore the evolutionary dynamics and functional divergence of LAR genes, we conducted a large-scale comparative and phylogenetic analyses across major plant clades. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple independent duplication events and lineage-specific expansions of LAR lineages, particularly among dicots and gymnosperms. In dicots, LAR1 and LAR2 were differentially retained and diversified, whereas gymnosperm LAR homologs formed early-diverging clades, suggesting an ancient duplication and potential neofunctionalization. Coexpression analyses across species and tissues indicate paralog-specific expression patterns. Sequence analysis identified both conserved and clade-specific protein domains, supporting functional divergence. Promoter analyses showed differences in transcription factor binding site composition between LAR1 and LAR2, pointing to regulatory sub- or neofunctionalization. Lastly, synteny analyses supports the potential absence of LAR in multiple Brassicacea genomes. Conclusions: LAR shows evidence of evolutionary diversification, shaped by both coding and regulatory changes. These patterns of diversification help explain variation in flavonoid profiles in gymnosperms and angiosperms. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of LAR not only deepens our knowledge of metabolic pathway evolution but also provides insights relevant to the breeding and metabolic engineering of plant traits related to pigmentation, stress resilience, and nutritional quality.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Genomic selection holds promise to accelerate varietal improvement, but its high implementation cost restricts its use in crops.

This study aims to assess the predictive ability of phenomic selection, alone and combined with genomic selection, for yield-related traits in a panel of elite spring pea lines evaluated across twelve environments. Three cross-validation scenarios were implemented to simulate predictions across different years and locations. Our results show that phenomic prediction is as effective as genomic selection at predicting yield, and is more accurate for seed protein content. The integrative model, combining spectral and molecular data, consistently achieved the highest accuracy for most traits, particularly for complex traits such as grain yield and seed protein. In temporal prediction scenarios, the most accurate predictions were obtained using the spectra data from the same year as phenotyping. In spatial prediction scenarios, predictive accuracy varied by site and year, nevertheless, integrative phenomic-genomic models consistently outperformed univariate approaches. These findings confirm the potential of phenomic selection in pea and underscore the added value of combining near-infrared spectroscopy and genotyping data to improve the prediction of complex traits in breeding programs.

We previously identified an artificially evolved Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant (H5) that retains wild-type growth (CC-503) while producing significantly more lipids. Here, we present multi-omic analyses that elucidate the molecular basis of this phenotype. Whole-genome sequencing revealed over 3,000 mutations in H5, including 45 in protein-coding genes (e.g., phosphofructokinase, acyl-carrier protein, glycerol kinase). Six corresponding CLiP insertion mutants also showed elevated lipid content. Transcriptomics revealed upregulation of key genes for glycolysis, nutrient uptake, and proliferation (e.g., pyruvate carboxylase, carbonic anhydrase) under nutrient-replete conditions. Metabolomics identified a striking increase in malonate, a metabolite that supports fatty acid synthesis and cell proliferation. Epigenomic profiling showed hypomethylation in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis genes and hypermethylation in energy balance regulators. Together, these data suggest that accelerated glycolysis and streamlined metabolism drive lipid accumulation in H5 without compromising growth.

While it has been central to their study for decades, no complete picture has emerged yet. Some of the most fascinating questions arise in the context of self-organised societies, like those of social insects, which coordinate their behaviour with completely decentralised simple decision-making performed by individuals that only have local information at their disposal. Based on empirical evidence, these collectives appear to balance task engagement globally across their whole task network for the benefit of the colony overall. How can this pro-social coordination be achieved by independently acting individuals? How is a global workforce balancing possible based on only local perception with no knowledge of the global colony status or needs? How can information flow through the task network, so that a changed task demand in one part of the network can lead to adjustments in distant other parts? We detail a model that presents a potential answer to this conundrum. Our model is informed by evolutionary game theory and rests on the assumption that the perception of an individual's sensory input can evolve. We present a conceptual argument and simulation studies to show that pro-social behaviour will evolve in a collective of agents that adjust their behaviour using primitive reinforcement mechanisms if we assume an evolving perception function.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

In this study we investigate pulsed speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (p-SCOS) as a non-invasive and label-free method to detect microclots in biofluids. Microclots at four concentrations (21k, 91k, 400k, and 1.7M microclots/mL), representing levels from healthy individuals to acute coagulopathic states, were generated using a freeze-thaw method. We measured speckle contrast under flowing conditions in a custom-made flow phantom. In phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and plasma, increasing microclot concentration consistently led to measurable decreases in speckle contrast. The measurement differentiated between low and high clot burdens in transparent media which highlights its potential for microclot monitoring. In comparison, no detectable changes were observed in whole blood, likely due to dominant scattering from red blood cells masking microclot effects. Overall, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of p-SCOS as a rapid and label-free tool for microclot detection and monitoring in transparent biofluids.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

A previous study identified that less than 4% of notebooks used for biomedical research were fully reproducible. Reusable and portable software are required to ensure compatibility with federated and cloud computing. The field requires computational workflows that meet high standards for reproducibility, reusability, and portability to allow benchmarking to be repeated and updated periodically. This is of particular importance in areas where new methods are frequently released, such as demultiplexing scRNA-seq, a critical early step in most scRNA-seq analysis pipelines. To address this, we developed demux_bench for benchmarking genetic demultiplexing methods in single-cell RNA sequencing, which meets the gold standard for reproducibility of computational workflows, and incorporates best practices for reusability and portability. We used workflow manager Nextflow to enable the simulation and testing of various benchmarking scenarios and methods in parallel from a single pipeline execution. Different experimental configurations can be simulated, including % doublets and class size imbalance. The pipeline includes genotype-free methods, Vireo and souporcell, and additional existing or novel methods can be added modularly. Demux_bench is configurable to reproduce specific analyses and generalisable to address new research questions. Software dependencies are handled through containers via Apptainer, allowing portability to different compute environments and avoiding the need for manual installation of software. Demux_bench is available on WorkflowHub (https://workflowhub.eu/workflows/1769), and can also be run on Galaxy and other platforms through RO-Crates.

Miniature insects thus utilize both lift and drag for weight support but the exact energetic costs of wing flapping at low Reynolds number are widely unexplored. We estimated flight power in the miniature wasp Eretmocerus mundus. Wing kinematics was three-dimensionally reconstructed using high-speed video and computational fluid dynamics simulated air flows, aerodynamic forces and moments. We found an asymmetrical crescent-shaped wingtip trajectory with the upstroke posterior to the downstroke path. This fore-aft distance increases with increasing horizontal flight velocity, maintaining the wing's backwards rowing motion needed for drag-based propulsion. Although the wing's lift-to-drag ratio is below unity, lift is the predominant force responsible for weight support and forward thrust. Elevated drag leads to mass-specific mechanical power output of 118+-9.0 Wkg-1 flight muscle, which exceeds most power estimates reported for other insects, birds and bats. The elevated energetic costs for flight may have fostered the development of bristled wings in miniature insects. Altogether, our study of wingbeat control and flight costs in a miniature insect extends the scope of flight mechanisms to the smallest flying animals revealing limits of miniaturization during the evolution of flight.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanism by which CAHS proteins protect the dehydrating cellular membrane remains enigmatic. Using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model membrane system, we show that encapsulated CAHS12 undergoes a reversible structural transformation that reinforces membrane integrity and preserves encapsulated components, mimicking natural anhydrobiosis. CAHS12-containing GUVs demonstrated stability for weeks and mechanical robustness under dehydration, elevated temperature, and osmotic stresses. Molecular simulations suggest that CAHS12 forms a filamentous network within the vesicle lumen that mitigates membrane collapse and preserves compartmental architecture. Notably, removal of the N-terminal domain of CAHS12 abrogates this protective function. Synthetic cells with cell-free transcription-translation capabilities survive desiccation and recover biochemical activities, akin to the tun state of the tardigrade.

Here, we utilized urine cells, hiPSCs, hiPSC-RPE cells, retinal organoids (ROs) and Prom1-/- mice to address these challenges. During photoreceptor development in ROs, PROM1 co-localized with ciliary marker ARL13B and outer segment (OS) marker PRPH2. It exhibited photoreceptor-specific mRNA splicing isoforms and unique N-glycosylation. In IRD patient-specific models with the PROM1 c.619G>T (p.E207X) homozygous mutation, we observed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and altered splicing, leading to complete loss of PROM1 protein and OS-like structure disruption, faithfully recapitulating PROM1-IRD pathology. To rescue these defects, we engineered a photoreceptor-specific AAV7m8-CRXp-hPROM1, which successfully restored PROM1 expression and OS-like structures in patient-derived ROs. Therapeutic efficacy was further validated in Prom1-/- mice, where subretinal delivery of AAV8-CRXp-hPROM1 led to photoreceptor-specific expression of human PROM1, significantly preserving OS morphology and improving visual function. These findings not only provide the first solid preclinical evidence supporting gene therapy for PROM1-IRD, but also reveal photoreceptor-specific vulnerability to PROM1 mutations, offering a novel conceptual framework for investigating and treating related IRDs.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Chronic activation of astrocytes and microglia fuels neuronal damage via cytokine secretion, oxidative stress, and proteolysis. However, glial inflammatory regulation remains poorly understood. Using chemoproteomics, we identified CK2, particularly the brain-enriched catalytic subunit CK22, as a key driver of astrocytic inflammation. CK2 enhances NF-{kappa}B activity by phosphorylating NF-{kappa}B S529 and I{kappa}B S32, promoting pro-inflammatory gene expression. CK2 inhibition via genetic or chemical approaches dampens inflammation, including IL-6 and IL-8 expression in an acute neuroinflammation mouse model. CK22 is upregulated in AD postmortem tissues and patient-derived astrocytes. AD astrocytes exhibit a hyperinflammatory state that can be attenuated by CK2 inhibition.

Coral probiotics have emerged as a promising restoration tool, yet their broad application is limited by our incomplete understanding of long-term microbial associations crucial to coral health. Microbes closely associated with the coral algal symbionts (Symbiodiniaceae) are particularly promising candidates, given their potential to enhance algal function and host resilience. Although recent studies have begun to characterize these Symbiodiniaceae-associated microbial communities, methodological differences in algal cell purification have led to inconsistent results. Here, we compared multiple sample processing steps to generate Symbiodiniaceae-enriched fractions from clonal fragments of Acropora nobilis, and examined the resulting microbial communities. We consistently detected members of Flavobacteraceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Rhizobiaceae, and the genus Marinobacter. Strikingly, Vibrio species dominated the Symbiodiniaceae fractions across protocols. We isolated and sequenced 11 Vibrio strains enriched in these fractions and identified genes related to both virulence and putative beneficial traits, including vitamin biosynthesis and antioxidant production. Despite confirming their high potential for virulence, the persistent association, spatial proximity to Symbiodiniaceae, and presence of genes suggesting beneficial functions point to possible mutualistic roles for these Vibrio strains within the coral holobiont.

However, the degree of spatial heterogeneity within and between vineyards and its relationship to cultivar-associated biodiversity selection has not been studied previously. We combined high-density sampling of grapevine microbiota (N = 230) with spatial modeling and satellite imagery in two experiments: (i) two monoclonal Chardonnay vineyards to examine spatial heterogeneity in a genetically homogenous population; and (ii) three old-vine vineyards interplanted with mixed cultivars to investigate the relative effects of spatial distance and cultivar on the microbiota. Contrary to expectations based on monoclonal vineyards, cultivar effects were not apparent in mixed-cultivar vineyards. Instead, we demonstrate extensive spatial variation in the bacterial and fungal communities inhabiting individual grapevines and vineyards, and that community similarity is correlated with spatial distance within and between vineyards. This suggests that dispersal limitation may play an important role in shaping grapevine microbiota, as well as cumulative diversity within the vineyard ecosystem (gamma diversity), with implications for both plant health and wine quality. Spatial models can identify abnormalities in microbial communities, such as contaminant sources within vineyards, and future studies examining microbiota in agricultural settings should account for spatial variation within the study design, e.g., by sufficiently dense spatial sampling or collection of grape musts to avoid undersampling bias.

Rising antibiotic resistance rates complicate treatment strategies. While nucleotide sequence based assays are reliable in predicting clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance, predicting metronidazole resistance is more challenging due to diverse metabolic pathways contributing to resistance, and high genomic variability. Methods: We assembled a cohort of 483 H. pylori clinical isolates, combining whole-genome sequencing with phenotypic susceptibility testing. Machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost, FNN) were trained on genomic variants to predict resistance phenotypes. A sliding-window approach and SHAP-based importance scoring were used for feature selection to identify biologically relevant mutations, improving prediction accuracy, particularly for metronidazole resistance. Results: The best-performing FNN model improved metronidazole resistance prediction by 16% compared to conventional (non-ML, single polymorphisms) sequence-based detection methods applied to the same strain collection. Feature selection identified 32 feature sets, with 11 sets significantly improving F1-scores over the baseline. Combining 2-4 feature sets revealed 53 synergistic combinations across all models. Validation showed that 87% of these combinations significantly outperformed non-ML molecular testing, with 16 combinations achieving F1-scores above 0.65.

V. cholerae are often infected with vibriophages and these phages may be found associated with V. cholerae bacteria or may be detected independently from the bacteria, especially in environmental water samples. When detected, vibriophages serve as a surrogate for detection of V. cholerae and they also have an important role in the ecology of V. cholerae. Vibriophages can be detected using plaque assays or PCR, but these methods are time-consuming and require specialized laboratory resources. Methodology. To address limitations of other methods, we developed a simple, rapid, and inexpensive colorimetric assay to detect vibriophage that can be scaled up to quickly and easily to screen a large number of samples. The assay uses resazurin and a bacterium, AC6169 that is susceptible to vibriophages ICP1, 2, and 3. Resazurin is a dye that turns color from blue to pink when added to a culture broth with growing bacteria. When a bacteria-free test sample, such as a Millipore filtered wastewater sample containing vibriophages, is added to a culture broth with AC6169, the bacteria will be lysed by the phages and will not grow, and the color of the broth will remain blue. However, if there are no phages in the sample, the bacteria will grow rapidly, and the culture broth will turn pink. We developed the assay using ICP1 spiked samples of environmental water, stool and frozen bile peptone and found it to be sensitive with a limit of detection of 4 to 40 plaque forming units/ml.

This colorimetric assay promises to provide a convenient method to detect vibriophages on a larger scale than was possible earlier to better understand their role as a surrogate for detecting V. cholerae and to better understand their role in the pathogenesis, ecology, and epidemiology of cholera.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Coral and sponge recruit survivorship and growth generally exhibited an inverted U-shaped response to light intensity, suggesting environmental optima at lower light levels, while the influence of light spectra remained less clear within environmentally realistic treatment combinations.

A safe and useful alternative to synthetic pesticides is provided by plant extracts. Among these plants are Neem trees, whose compounds have shown great promise in the control of insect pests. Methods: Azadirachta indica was collected from Asmara around Orotta hospital. To improve the extraction efficiency, the dried leaves were crushed and a solution was prepared for spraying. The weight loss of the attacked wood and the mortality rate of termites were measured. Macrotermes ballicosus was taken from a termite mound that was excavated and put into two different containers with identical spaces. For both the control and experimental (sprayed with the sample solution) trials, six pieces of wood with weights of 30g, 30g and 20g were placed in the mound. Fertilizer was prepared from Neem seeds and used to assess the impact of the various treatments on the Lactuca sativa plots in two different sites. Results: An increase in the hours of Neem extract exposure showed an increase in the corrected mortality rate. It started with 0 hours at 0%, and at 18 hours, there was 11% increase in mortality rate, until it started to decrease due to the low number of insects. In the control group, the mound began to close up after five hours, but in the experimental group, the hole remained open after 36 hours. The present study found experimental group had 50% weight loss, while the control group had a total weight loss of 75%. The extract had an efficiency of 25% decrease in weight loss. The plots with medium concentrated extraction showed a greater mean area (918 cm2 -site one and 482.5 cm2 -site two) than the experimental and control groups. Conclusion: Azadirachta indica extract is highly effective in controlling Macrotermes ballicosus. To find out how effective Neem is against a variety of other common insect pests and at larger doses, more research is necessary.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

A.; Sedlazeck, F. F.; Piedra, P. A.", "abstract": "Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in infants and poses significant risks to immuno-compromised individuals and the elderly. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted typical RSV seasonality, leading to unusual patterns of viral circulation and resurgence. This study aimed to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of RSV in Houston, Texas, across pre-pandemic (November 2015 to March 2020), pandemic (April 2021 to June 2023), and post-pandemic periods (July 2023 to December 2024), focusing on genetic diversity, lineage dynamics, and selective pressures. Methods: We analyzed 1,344 RSV-positive respiratory samples collected from children seeking outpatient care or hospitalized with acute respiratory infections between November 2015 to February 2024. We successfully sequenced the whole genomes for 87.5% of the isolates (606 RSV/A and 570 RSV/B). To assess genetic diversity, lineage dynamics, and selective pressures, we conducted phylogenetic analysis, variant calling, and dN/dS ratio calculations. We clustered variant prevalence patterns using k-means and used Shannon entropy to quantify genetic variability. We performed statistical regression analyses to evaluate the accumulation of variants and their impact on gene expression. Results: RSV circulation in Houston was disrupted during the pandemic, with an absence of cases in 2020-2021 followed by off-season surges from 2021 to 2023. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct lineage dynamics, with RSV/A showing remarkable persistence of specific lineages such as A.D.1 and emergence of new lineages including A.D.3. In contrast, RSV/B underwent a dramatic restructuring, dominated by the B.D.E.1 lineage in the pandemic and post-pandemic period. Furthermore, RSV/B exhibited higher genetic diversity and accumulated non-synonymous variants at nearly twice the rate of RSV/A, notably in the M2-2 gene. The significant increase in non-synonymous mutations in M2-2 in RSV/B during the pandemic and post-pandemic time phases, strongly correlated with increased transcriptional activity. Additionally, antigenic site mutations in the F protein, particularly in RSV/B, were also observed, with implications for immune evasion and effectiveness of therapeutics. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted RSV evolution, leading to reduced genetic diversity during the pandemic and the emergence of novel lineages post-pandemic. RSV/B exhibited more dynamic evolutionary changes, particularly in the M2-2 gene, suggesting potential adaptive advantages. Ongoing genomic surveillance coupled with functional studies are crucial for monitoring variants and assessing the clinical impact of these mutations on transmission, disease severity, fitness, and long-term effectiveness of RSV prevention and treatment strategies.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Investigations of morphofunctional associations with ecological factors have frequently focused on the external morphology of avian wing bones; however, the extent to which such associations also apply to the internal structure of the wing skeleton remains understudied. Here, we investigate disparity of the internal epiphyseal and diaphyseal structure of the avian humerus and ulna, and explore its correlates with ecology. Our dataset of 140 species spans extant bird diversity, and demonstrates that the internal structure of avian wing bones exhibits limited ecological signal beyond expected secondary trends related to flightlessness and marine habits. Our work instead shows that variation is primarily determined by body size, suggesting that functional constraints on internal wing bone structure imposed by flight are essentially universal across flying birds irrespective of most ecological habits and flight styles. Despite this broad lack of ecological signal, distinctive aspects of forelimb internal structure may facilitate the identification of flightless bird taxa in the fossil record.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia latifasciata, integrating PacBio long reads, Illumina short reads, and Hi-C chromatin contact maps to resolve both A and B chromosomes. The 0.93 Gb assembly (N50 = 36.2 Mb) includes a 34 Mb B chromosome containing 789 predicted protein-coding genes and a markedly higher density of transposable elements (TEs), especially long terminal repeats (LTR) retrotransposons. Transcriptome profiling revealed that B-linked genes are predominantly transcriptionally repressed relative to their A chromosome paralogs. Hi-C based chromatin modeling uncovered distinct 3D structural configurations associated with the B chromosome, including fewer topologically associating domains (TADs), reduced loop formation, and altered compartmentalization. These changes are linked to long-range chromatin interactions and genomic rearrangements, suggesting that the B chromosome reshapes the nuclear architecture of the host genome.

While divergence in gene expression has been widely studied post-WGD, the long-term evolutionary dynamics of alternative splicing (AS) and its regulatory basis remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the evolution of AS in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a species that underwent a salmonid-specific WGD ~100 million years ago. Using a high-quality genome assembly, transcriptome data across six tissues, and ChIP-seq profiling of histone modifications, we classify ohnologue pairs based on their expression divergence, splicing complexity, and epigenetic signatures. We find that most ohnologues are retained through conservation, with a gradual reduction in AS diversity over time. Contrary to earlier models, a substantial fraction of ohnologues follows an independent splicing model, maintaining splicing complexity similar to their unduplicated ancestors. Strikingly, we show that enhancer-associated histone marks, particularly H3K27ac, diverge significantly between neofunctionalized and independently splicing gene pairs, implicating enhancer rewiring as a key driver of regulatory and functional divergence. These findings reveal that AS evolution after WGD is shaped by both selective pressures and epigenetic modulation, challenging assumptions of rapid splicing loss and highlighting the independent model as a dominant long-term fate. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding how splicing and regulatory landscapes evolve following genome duplication, with broad implications for vertebrate genome evolution and functional innovation.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

We developed a benchmarking framework for cell-type specific footprinting and used it to evaluate the consistency, reproducibility, and equivalency of three leading methods across data quality scenarios and as a function of cell-type similarity. Peak-level read coverage emerged as the strongest predictor of stable footprints. Motivated by limited reproducibility across tools, we built an ensemble model that improved concordance with ChIP-seq.

The spread of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus combined to the massive use of pyrethroid insecticides to limit arbovirus transmission resulted in the rise of resistance in various continents. Here, we investigated the genetic mechanisms underlying the recent adaptation of this mosquito to deltamethrin in La Reunion island. Bioassays confirmed the presence of resistance alleles in field populations. The resistance phenotype was further enhanced in the laboratory following a few generations of controlled selection. Combining whole genome Pool-seq and RNA-seq revealed no evidence of target-site resistance mutations but the over-expression and variant selection of detoxification enzymes associated with pyrethroid metabolism including cytochrome P450s, transferases and ABC-transporters. Among over-expressed detoxification genes, only one was linked to a gene duplication while polymorphism data suggest most of them being trans-regulated. Genome-wide selection signatures revealed a 9 Mb inverted superlocus responding to insecticide selection whose phenotypical importance remains uncertain. Altogether, this study indicates that the multigenic metabolic resistance phenotype observed in this insular territory mainly results from local adaptation. From an applied perspective, this study provides a set of markers to track pyrethroid resistance in the tiger mosquito in the South-West Indian Ocean. As this region is subjected to recurrent arbovirus outbreaks, the additive resistance phenotype that may arise from the introduction of Kdr mutations from other territories also calls for improving resistance surveillance at the regional scale.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

To investigate this, we measured human localization performance with natural and artificial stimuli that selectively included or excluded ITD and ILD as primary interaural cues. As expected, human listeners relied synergistically on ITD and ILD for accurate azimuth localization. Moreover, even when both primary cues were absent, localization performance remained above chance level. We compared human performance with state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNN) optimized for sound localization to investigate possible computational mechanisms underlying this robust performance. In contrast to humans, DNNs demonstrated high accuracy only for stimuli that resembled their training regime but failed when primary interaural cues were absent. This human-DNN misalignment highlights a fundamental distinction in sensory processing strategies, potentially arising from the simplicity bias inherent in DNN training, with human reliance on a wider range of auditory features likely reflecting evolutionary pressures favoring adaptability across diverse acoustic environments. Together, our results demonstrate the robustness of human spatial hearing beyond primary interaural cues and point to promising directions for advancing artificial systems and informing clinical applications, such as cochlear implants and auditory prosthetics.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we develop a nanovial-based functional screening platform that enables high-throughput discovery of TCRs from unconventional T cells based on direct antigen recognition and cytokine secretion.

The combined coating approach achieved relatively high level of protein coating and exerted superior control over the diameter and uniformity of DCmPs relative to sonication and extrusion. We also developed a characterization strategy by leveraging the homotypic interactions between DCmPs and DC2.4 cells and determined that about 80% of PLGA particles are coated with membrane proteins and both unbound proteins and uncoated particles similarly present in the final products after the three coating processes. Because DC2.4 cells exclusively express MHC class I molecules, DCmPs showed preferentially bind to cognate B3Z CD8+ T cells over DOBW CD4+ T cells, confirming that DCmPs bind to T cells in an antigen-specific fashion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DCmPs can activate B3Z CD8+ T cells in vitro, similar to DC2.4 cells.

While mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists are not first-line treatments for chronic pain, previous data suggests that ~70% of chronic neuropathic pain patients receive MOR agonist treatment. Previous studies demonstrated decreased MOR expression and activity in pain states compared with non-injured or sham controls; however, we know little about how chronic pain states may alter the antinociceptive- and antihyperalgesic-like effects of MOR agonists in vivo. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if there were significant differences in MOR agonist-induced antinociceptive- or antihyperalgesic-like effects between SNI and sham groups. MOR agonist-induced antinociceptive- and antihyperalgesic-like effects were evaluated in SNI and sham groups repeatedly over 6 months. MOR agonists induced dose-dependent antinociceptive- and antihyperalgesic-like effects in male and female rats in the expected rank order of potency (fentanyl>morphine[&ge;]nalbuphine). Over time, there were small rightward shifts in fentanyl- and morphine-induced effects; however, these rightward shifts were observed in sham and SNI groups, suggesting this occurred independent of pain state. Interestingly, in sham and SNI groups, nalbuphine-induced effects were more potent 6 months post-operatively than 3 months, suggesting the potency of nalbuphine changed over time, independent of pain state. Other, non-MOR agonist analgesics were evaluated. Collectively, these data indicate that SNI failed to alter MOR agonist-induced antinociceptive- and antihyperalgesic-like effects. Future studies should evaluate if the SNI-independent increase in sensitivity to nalbuphine is related to the partial KOR agonist activity and if SNI-induced hypersensitivity alters tolerance following repeated administration of MOR agonists.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Herein, we report that PIEZO1 plays a crucial role in enhancing decidualization in response to ECM stiffness and cell contraction. Uterine-specific Piezo1 knockout in mice results in subfertility due to decidualization impairment. PIEZO1 Silencing in human endometrial stromal cells results in impaired decidualization. Yoda1 enhances decidualization in both in vivo and vitro models. Stromal cells growing on ECM with 25 kPa stiffness display a better decidualization response than cells seeded on softer surface or harder surface of the regulator petri dish, and this difference is abolished by null of Piezo1. Consistent with PIEZO1 as Ca2+ modulator, blocking of intracellular Ca2+ or pCaMKII significantly inhibits Yoda1-enhanced decidualization. Further investigation reveals BECN1-dependent autophagy acts as downstream of PIEZO1. Silencing of Beclin1 abolishes Yoda1-induced decidualization, while Tat-BECN1 fully rescues impaired decidualization caused by lack of PIEZO1.

M.", "abstract": "Introduction Intracranial aneurysm (ICA) rupture is the most common cause of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, a devastating type of stroke. Vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) and endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and death play important roles in the etiology of ICA formation, rupture and treatment failure. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been extensively investigated for their therapeutic potential in vascular diseases. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulatory pathway involved in cellular functions controlling intracellular anabolic and regulatory processes. Rapamycin, a specific mTOR complex 1 inhibitor, is widely used in the clinical management of cardiac and vascular pathologies. In this study, we explored MSCs potential to express VSMC and EC markers under the influence of rapamycin. Methods Human MSCs were treated with rapamycin for 2, 5, and 10 days, and cell death and proliferation determined by MTT analysis. Protein expression and phosphorylation levels were determined by western blot analysis. Calcein AM and PI staining was used to determine cell viability, and morphology. Results MTT and Calcein AM analysis demonstrated that prolonged rapamycin treatment did not affect MSC viability but was found to reduce MSC proliferation and cause a nearly threefold increase in cell size compared to controls. Rapamycin treatment increased expression of the VSMC protein markers, Alpha-SMA, and transgelin and was required to maintain elevated expression levels both proteins. In contrast, selective inhibition of mTORC2 with JR-AB2-01 caused a decrease in Alpha-SMA and trangelin expression, suggesting mTORC1 regulation of Alpha-SMA and transgelin expression, rather than mTORC2. Rapamycin treated MSC were also found to induce cell sprouting between adjacent cells. MSCs were found not to express endothelial protein markers under either basal conditions or following rapamycin treatment. However, rapamycin treatment was found to increase VEGFA expression, a known promoter of angiogenesis. Conclusion Rapamycin has the potential to increase VSMC protein expression in MSCs by its action on mTORC1. The ability of rapamycin to increase VEGFA expression in MSCs could allow for a novel MSC-based therapeutic intervention in cerebral aneurysm management which could aid in ICA healing and reducing rupture risk.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Current neurorehabilitation needs have increased the demand for quantitative clinical assessments of bilateral coordination. Robotics and computer vision for motion tracking are two means to provide relevant quantitative metrics but have many differences including the dimensionality of reaching movements (planar versus three-dimensional) and data acquisition. We do not know how consistent measures of bilateral coordination performance are between these different assessments. In this study, we examined how one robotic and one computer vision method can identify differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical reaching, and the correlations in movement time, and hand lag between these two approaches. Thirty healthy young adults completed four reaching games using the Kinarm exoskeleton robot and a custom developed augmented reality assessment using computer vision. We found that both approaches were able to detect well-established movement time and hand lag differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical reaching, with the differences between symmetrical and asymmetrical being larger with the computer vision approach. Moderate correlations were found between approaches for unilateral and symmetric reaching in both movement time and hand lags; however, no significant correlations were found between approaches for asymmetric reaching. Our results show that reaching task performance differs between robotic and computer vision-based assessment, however, both approaches provide quantitative metrics of unilateral and bilateral reaching that are consistent with prior research. There are benefits and tradeoffs to each approach, and this study informs how clinicians and researchers can consider the methodological differences when determining which assessment method to use.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

For patients who are not cured by surgery or for patients who present with distant metastatic disease, there is no known cure. T cell engagers (TCEs) are an emerging class of biologics that simultaneously bind to tumor cell surface antigens and the CD3 domain of T cells, thereby redirecting endogenous T cells to lyse and eliminate tumor cells. TCEs can mediate durable tumor regression, including complete responses, and are now approved to treat both multiple cancer types outside of MTC. RNASeq analysis of 30 MTC tumors, cross-referencing with public databases and an extensive literature review was used to identify CEA, DLL3 and GFRA4 as promising tumor antigens to target with TCEs. Expression of these antigens was then validated on MTC cell lines. Herein, I describe the discovery, application and development of MTC-targeted TCEs (MTCEs) recognizing the MTC tumor antigens CEA, DLL3 and GFRA4. In vitro, MTCEs mediate potent target-dependent and T cell-dependent cytotoxicity against MTC cell lines at concentrations of just 10 ng/mL. MTCEs also induce target-dependent IFNg secretion from T cells, with no measurable IFNg secretion observed in the presence of antigen-negative cell lines. Further, MTCEs are functionally compatible with the FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors selpercatinib and cabozantinib, and combination therapy numerically enhances cytotoxicity. These preclinical data provide strong rationale for continued development of MTCEs, which may one day revolutionize the treatment of metastatic MTC.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Thymomas, epithelial tumors of the thymus frequently associated with autoimmunity, commonly arise in adults and often retain the capacity to support thymopoiesis, providing a unique model for studying self-tolerance in humans. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of thymic epithelial cells from thymoma patients, we identified ASCL1 as a transcription factor markedly downregulated in tumor mTECs. In mice, deletion of Ascl1 in TECs induced autoimmunity without tumor development. ASCL1 exhibited pioneer factor-like activity, shaping the chromatin landscape to regulate both AIRE-dependent and -independent gene programs. Notably, combined deletion of Ascl1 and Aire in TECs of aged mice led to ectopic thymic B cell follicle formation, a hallmark of both thymoma-associated and idiopathic myasthenia gravis.

R.; Dalal, S.; Dapper, C.; Klemba, M.", "abstract": "Host-derived lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a significant source of choline and fatty acids for the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Two lysophospholipases play a dominant role in LPC catabolism: exported lipase 2 (XL2) and exported lipase homolog 4 (XLH4). Loss of these two enzymes greatly reduces, but does not abrogate, the parasite's ability to utilize LPC as a source of fatty acids. In this study, we identify a third enzyme, termed prodrug activation and resistance esterase (PARE), that mediates low levels of LPC hydrolysis. Loss of PARE alone had no effect on the parasite's ability to scavenge fatty acids from LPC. However, when combined with the loss of XL2 and XLH4, knockdown of PARE impacted the parasite's ability to scavenge both choline and fatty acids from LPC. Furthermore, PARE/XL2/XLH4-deficient parasites were unable to complete a replication cycle when cultured in defined media with LPC as the sole source of exogenous fatty acids. We show that PARE is a membrane-associated enzyme with a substantial presence at the parasite periphery and propose a model whereby PARE catalyzes the hydrolysis of inwardly-diffusing LPC.

Many of these individuals will have at least one positive culture per year for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that readily adapts to live in the lungs. Of these adaptations, the formation of a protective biofilm and changes in motility are hallmarks of established infections. We have shown previous evidence that glycerol metabolism and the P. aeruginosa glycerol regulon repressor, GlpR, is linked to enhanced biofilm production and reduced susceptibility to tobramycin. We report that loss of GlpR contributes to higher viscosity and elasticity in synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum media. Further, we show that the loss of the glycerol repressor GlpR, or growth on glycerol, both resulting in derepression of the GlpR/glycerol regulon, cause decreased motility in both acute and chronic CF-adapted lab strains. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that loss of GlpR altered the expression of genes involved in motility, iron scavenging, transport, metabolism, and virulence. An in silico search of P. aeruginosas genome using GlpRs previously determined binding consensus site identified potential bindings sites in genes related to biofilm development, motility, antibiotic resistance, and metabolism, and these binding sites were confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing.

Crystal structural analysis revealed that PAc binds substrate RNA via the YDS motif (residues 393-395), with mutations abolishing RNA association. Surprisingly, baloxavir acid (BXA), a known PA inhibitor, specifically targeted PAc rather than PAn, supported by molecular docking showing higher binding affinity to PAc. Mutations at PAc-BXA interaction sites identified F707A as a potential drug resistance mutation. Virtual screening targeting PAc identified methotrexate as potent inhibitors (EC50 < 100 nM)which effectively suppressed viral replication in vitro and alleviated symptoms in influenza-infected mice.

While cellular stress responses promote tolerance in model organisms, their role in Staphylococcus aureus infections remains unclear. In this study, we investigate whether host environments activate bacterial stress responses that lead to antibiotic tolerance. We constructed fluorescent reporters to monitor five stress responses: SOS, oxidative stress, stringent response (cell wall stress and starvation pathways), and heat shock response. Using confocal microscopy, we quantified stress response activation in planktonic cultures, in biofilms, in laboratory media versus human serum, and during neutrophil phagocytosis. We then correlated stress response activation with antibiotic tolerance in time-kill assays. Individual stress responses were specifically activated with minimal cross-activation. Pre-activation of stringent and heat shock responses significantly reduced ciprofloxacin susceptibility, while oxidative stress activation slightly increased susceptibility. Growth of S. aureus biofilms in 100% serum activated all stress responses, while biofilms grown in laboratory media showed no activation. Brief serum exposure (1h) activated the stringent response and conferred complete ciprofloxacin tolerance. During neutrophil phagocytosis, bacteria activated all stress responses. We conclude that the host environment strongly activates multiple stress responses in S. aureus, with stringent and heat shock responses correlating with antibiotic tolerance. The infectious microenvironment primes bacteria for tolerance through stress response activation, providing potential therapeutic targets.

TB disease, caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is heterogeneous between individuals, and clinical TB outcomes are impacted by genetic and environmental risk factors. Infected individuals must maintain a careful balance of cytokines and chemokines following M.tb infection to eliminate or contain the bacteria without causing excessive inflammation and lung damage. The CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) is expressed by several immune cell populations that are classically involved in the pathogenesis of M.tb infection. However, the precise functions of CCR6 in the context of TB disease remain underexplored. Here, we show that mice lacking the CCR6 receptor (CCR6 KO) fail to restrict bacterial burden in the lungs, leading to increased disseminated infection at 4-weeks post-infection compared to wild-type C57BL/6J (B6) mice, with a more pronounced effect in females. CCR6 KO mice also developed necrotic pulmonary lesions, phenotypically distinct from B6 mice, and produced elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines at the onset of adaptive immunity, particularly IL-17. Long-term infection experiments revealed that the absence of CCR6 enhances risk for mortality following M.tb infection, particularly in females. This study provides insights into the role of CCR6 during TB pathogenesis and establishes its importance in maintaining protective immunity against M.tb within the context of a genetically tractable mouse model that forms necrotic pulmonary granulomas.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

We analyzed 8.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms from 96 cultivated almond (Prunus dulcis) accessions from Europe, North America, Central Asia, and New Zealand, alongside four wild relatives. Population structure analyses revealed four geographically differentiated cultivated groups (Central Asian, North American, and two European) and three wild populations (P. spinosissima, P. orientalis, and P. fenzliana). Cultivated almonds retained high genetic diversity, consistent with weak domestication bottlenecks typical of outcrossing perennials. Elevated diversity and private allele counts in Central Asian cultivars, with limited gene flow, support this region as an independent cradle of domestication. In contrast, extensive wild-to-crop gene flow, especially involving P. orientalis, has shaped the genomes of European and North American almonds. Genome-wide scans for selective sweeps showed most candidate genes under selection were population-specific, though often associated with similar biological functions, including stress responses and agronomic traits. This suggests repeated targeting of comparable pathways during domestication, despite distinct selection histories. Several selected genes in cultivated populations overlapped with those in wild relatives, particularly P. orientalis. Combined with demographic inferences indicating wild populations persistence through past climate fluctuations, these findings suggest wild gene pools retain adaptive alleles, either ancestrally shared or introgressed, that contributed to cultivated diversity.

We carry out experimental validation of the method conditioning only on the heavy sequence and on the heavy sequence and binding information. Our in vitro results show that sequences created by LICHEN have effective expression yields and can retain antigen-binding.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

In this study, we present ALLM-Ab (Active Learning with Language Models for Antibodies), a novel active learning framework that leverages fine-tuned protein language models to accelerate antibody sequence optimization. By employing parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adaptation, coupled with a learning-to-rank strategy, ALLM-Ab accurately assesses mutant fitness while efficiently generating candidate sequences through direct sampling from the model's probability distribution. Furthermore, by integrating a multi-objective optimization scheme incorporating antibody developability metrics, the framework ensures that optimized sequences retain therapeutic antibody-like properties alongside improved binding affinity. We validate ALLM-Ab in both offline experiments using deep mutational scanning (DMS) data from the BindingGYM dataset and online active learning trials targeting Flex ddG energy minimization across 15 antigens. Results demonstrate that ALLM-Ab not only expedites the discovery of high-affinity variants compared to baseline Gaussian process regression and genetic algorithm-based approaches, but also preserves critical antibody developability metrics.

Here, we used protein and DNA sequences as well as RNA structure to search for Hok homologs. Hok was detected in almost 80% of the available Enterobacteriaceae genomes and, more rarely, in three other bacterial families. Similarity clustering analysis of thousands of Hok homologs unveiled high Hok sequence variability and uncovered clusters of novel homologs. Experimental validation of representative sequences from the most abundant clusters revealed their toxicity, regardless of their localization. After scanning dedicated databases, we observed enrichment of Hok sequences in prophages and large conjugative plasmids.

Here, we used time-series transcriptomics to elucidate crocin's anti-cancer mechanisms in HCC cells. We treated HepG2 cells with 1 and 2 mM crocin for 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours and analyzed transcriptomic profiles at each timepoint. The strongest transcriptional response occurred at 2 hours with 1 mM crocin, with diminishing effects at later timepoints. We observed upregulation of metabolic-, adhesion-, and endocytosis-related genes across all timepoints. Pathway analysis revealed activation of DNA damage checkpoints and senescence while proliferation pathways were suppressed. Notably, 52 genes involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were downregulated at 24 hours (FDR p = 8 x 10-), suggesting reversal of carcinogenic pathways. Strikingly, crocin consistently downregulated spliceosomal machinery genes across all timepoints while upregulating senescence and autophagy pathways. This spliceosome targeting represents a clinically relevant mechanism, as aberrant splicing drives oncogenesis in more than 90% of cancers. The transcription factor PAX5 was significantly upregulated while oncogenic ELK1 targets were downregulated. Our findings show that crocin treatment is accompanied by HCC cell senescence induction through coordinated spliceosome disruption and metabolic reprogramming, providing novel therapeutic targets for hepatocellular carcinoma.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

While single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided valuable insights into cell-type-specific responses to IH, previous studies have primarily focused on post-hypoxic recovery states, leaving immediate molecular responses during active IH exposure unexplored. To address this critical knowledge gap, we investigated real-time transcriptional responses to IH at single-cell resolution in lung tissue using male mice (n=3/group) exposed to either normoxia or IH (30 cycles/h, nadir 6% O2, 12 h/day) for 14 days, with tissue collection during active IH exposure. Our analysis revealed pronounced cell-type-specific transcriptional reprogramming, particularly in airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC), arterial endothelial cells (AEC), and lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). These changes were characterized by enrichment in pathways related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (ASMC, LEC), myogenesis (ASMC), and antioxidant defenses (AEC, LEC). Most cell types demonstrated substantial upregulation of genes encoding mitochondrial complex I-IV proteins and TCA cycle enzymes accompanied by a decreased expression of genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA that was markedly present in LEC, AEC, and cells of the alveolar-capillary unit, revealing a mito-nuclear imbalance. These findings provide novel insights into the immediate cellular responses to IH, showing previously uncharacterized metabolic reorganization that may underlie the development of IH-related pulmonary complications.

Deubiquitinases (DUBs) counter ubiquitin ligases by removing ubiquitin from molecular targets. We hypothesized that DUBs might offset ubiquitin ligase activity and negatively regulate host immunity to Mtb. Here, we identify ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) as a negative regulator of autophagy-mediated macrophage immunity to Mtb. Using a targeted knockdown screen in mouse macrophages, we found that Usp15 loss increased K63-linked ubiquitination and LC3 recruitment to Mtb-associated structures, leading to reduced bacterial replication. These effects required USP15's catalytic activity and were reversed by knockdown of PARKIN (Park2) or inhibition of autophagy initiation. In primary human macrophages, USP15 knockdown similarly enhanced LC3 targeting and restricted Mtb growth. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of USP15 with a selective small molecule decreased Mtb burden in human macrophages. Our findings identify USP15 as a suppressor of macrophage immunity and suggest that targeting deubiquitinases may represent a promising host-directed therapeutic strategy against tuberculosis.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

These CRC entities present different molecular phenotypes and prognosis. Accumulation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) reflects poor prognosis and recurrence of CRC. CAF-cancer cell crosstalk regulates fibroblast activation and drives CRC progression, facilitated via secretomes including TGF{beta}1. CAF-cancer cell interplay according to colon sidedness have yet to be fully investigated due to the lack of robust marker for CAF. Objective: To explore a novel CAF marker in differentiating the mechanisms of LCRC and RCRC. Methods: CAFs from cancerous tissues of LCRC and RCRC patients and normal fibroblasts from adjacent normal colon tissues were established. Profiling of these fibroblasts were performed. Gene expression of the fibroblasts was analyzed via Affymetrix Clariom S (Human) assay, validated using Western blot. The effect of TGF{beta}1 on protein expression of fibroblasts was also studied. Epithelial cancer cell lines were used as controls. Results: Fibroblast profiling showed differences in morphology and proliferation between CAFs and NFs, and pro-proliferative effect of CAFs on CRC cells. Molecular analyses revealed RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) to be differentially expressed between CAFs and NFs from left and right colon. RBPMS was significantly upregulated in CAFs from LCRC compared to their respective NFs. In contrast, RBPMS was downregulated in CAFs from RCRC compared to their NFs (p<0.05). Furthermore, TGF{beta}1 induced RBPMS expression in CAFs and NFs from the left colon, whereas it suppressed RBPMS expression in fibroblasts from right colon. CAFs from LCRC resembled myCAFs with myofibroblast-related expression signatures, whereas those from RCRC signified iCAFs with inflammatory marker expression. Conclusion: This study highlighted RBPMS as a novel CAF marker in differentiating the mechanisms between LCRC and RCRC.

Though alternative splicing facilitates cellular adaptation through rapid modulation of gene expression and protein isoform diversity, its regulatory role during endosymbiosis remains poorly understood. Paramecium bursaria, which harbors hundreds of Chlorella variabilis algae within its cytoplasm, offers a powerful model to study splicing during endosymbiosis, especially given its exceptionally short introns (median ~24 nt). Using time-course RNA sequencing of symbiotic and aposymbiotic cells, we found that splicing, especially of 5' proximal introns, enhances gene expression. Moreover, we identified 883 genes with differentially spliced introns, particularly enriched in transmembrane transporters essential for establishing nutrient exchange between a host cell and algal symbionts. Splicing regulation correlated with expression changes in conserved spliceosome components, implicating that these factors act as splicing enhancers or repressors during symbiosis. By exploring intron orthology across ciliates, we found that conserved introns exhibited more efficient splicing, characterized by lower GC content and uniform length, suggesting that intron evolution favors features that optimize expression. Our study reveals how splicing contributes to host adaptation during endosymbiosis and highlights the evolutionary dynamics of short introns in eukaryotes.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

We treated the BT245 patient-derived glioma cell line with pharmacological combinations targeting neuronal differentiation pathways and performed bulk RNA sequencing to characterize gene expression patterns driving cell fate transitions. Our findings reveal that the drug combinations induce transcriptomic changes consistent with differentiation towards neuronal phenotypes, including the upregulation of synaptic and dendritic signaling genes and the downregulation of malignant signatures. In comparison, astrocytic differentiation media (DM) and H3K27M knockout (KO) promote residual astrocytic phenotypes, suggesting neuronal transdifferentiation as a more effective strategy for mitigating tumor aggressiveness and progression. Differentially expressed genes such as GRIK1, GRIN1, NRXN3, NRXN1, CALB2, SCGN, SLC32A1, SLC1A2, KCNC3, and neurodevelopmental regulators including WNT7A, DLX6, ERBB4, ARX, BCL11B, SEMA3C, and FGFBP3 were identified as key markers regulating the neuron-like lineage transition.

This study investigated the neural correlates of reward-based motor learning and focused on two electrophysiological markers: event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the sensorimotor cortex and feedback-related negativity (FRN) from frontal EEG channels. Sixty-four healthy adults performed a visuomotor rotation task with monetary reward or punishment feedback. Learning amount, defined as the degree of error compensation, and retention amount, defined as the maintenance of adapted motor behavior in a no-vision condition, were quantified. Scalp EEG was recorded to assess alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) ERD over the primary motor cortex (M1) during movement preparation and FRN amplitude following feedback presentation. Stepwise regression revealed that FRN amplitude in the late adaptation phase was associated with learning amount, but only among participants with robust event-related potential (ERP) responses (amplitude > {+/-}5 V). This finding suggests that greater neural sensitivity to feedback supports better learning. In contrast, alpha ERD magnitude in the late adaptation phase, along with reinforcement conditions, was a significant predictor of motor skill retention in the full sample, although no interaction effect was observed. These findings suggest that FRN and alpha ERD reflect dissociable neural mechanisms underlying learning and retention, respectively, with FRN indexing feedback sensitivity and alpha ERD reflecting cortical excitability related to memory consolidation. The absence of interaction effects between neural markers and reinforcement conditions further supports the idea that these processes contribute independently to motor adaptation. Practically, combining reward-based training with interventions that increase M1 excitability may enhance retention, while tailoring feedback strategies to maximize FRN responses may improve learning efficiency. These findings provide novel insights into the neural basis of individual variability in motor learning and suggest avenues for personalized approaches in rehabilitation and skill learning.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Complementary work, primarily in non-human primates, suggests an additional role for beta (15-30Hz) oscillations in clearing or inhibiting stimuli from entering WM. Here we investigated the role of neural oscillations in prioritising WM content using electroencephalography (EEG) as participants (humans of any sex) performed a task requiring frequent priority switches between two memorized oriented bars. Behavioral performance revealed switch costs, which scaled with the angular distance between the two items, suggesting that priority shifts are modulated by shift magnitude. Time-frequency analyses revealed increased frontal theta (4-8Hz) and decreased central-parietal beta (15-25Hz) power during switches. Crucially, only beta desynchronization scaled with the magnitude of the priority shift and predicted the fidelity of neural decoding of the newly prioritized item during subsequent recall.

When associations are instead formed between unrelated cues and threats, the maladaptive learning process can give rise to neurological disorders. Therefore, maintaining accurate temporal boundaries for forming such associations is crucial for distinguishing real threats from irrelevant stimuli. Despite its importance, the mechanisms defining this precise time window remain poorly understood. Here, we report that serotonin plays a crucial role in modulating the associable interval in trace fear conditioning. Specifically, we show that serotonergic projections from the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) to the CA1 region of the ventral hippocampus (vCA1) dynamically regulate the association of discontiguous CS and US. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that sustained serotonin release in the vCA1 maintains the ensemble activity of 5-HT2C receptor-expressing pyramidal neurons, facilitating the association between temporally separated events. In contrast, when the trace interval exceeds the associable window, transient serotonin release fails to drive vCA1 neuronal ensemble activity, thus preventing maladaptive learning.

N.; Roers, A.; Ng, F.; Behrendt, R.; Hunt, D.", "abstract": "SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Mechanistic heterogeneity is a major obstacle to the development of effective treatment for Sjogren disease (SjD) and there is a pressing need to stratify SjD according to precision medicine principles. Aberrant activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway represents a leading candidate pathway, but a causal role of elevated IFN-alpha in driving a Sjogren disease endotype remains to be established. METHODS: We used ultrasensitive single molecule ELISA, and an oligoprotein interferon signature score (derived from broad capture proteomics), to study the role of IFN-alpha in Sjogren disease. We analysed samples from the UK Primary Sjogren Syndrome Registry (UKPSSR, n=177) and UK Biobank Plasma Proteomics Project (n=47606 without Sjogren, n=257 with Sjogren, including 137 individuals sampled prior to diagnosis) to determine the timecourse and immune endotype associated with elevated IFN-alpha. To address causality we created a new transgenic mouse model of IFN-alpha overexpression to establish whether chronically elevated IFN-alpha drives this immune endotype. FINDINGS: Oligoprotein interferon signatures can be detected at least 14 years prior to diagnosis of Sjogren disease in the UK Biobank-PPP. IFN-alpha concentrations are elevated in 60% of Sjogren disease patients in the UKPSSR. Individuals with elevated IFN-alpha display a distinct immunological endotype characterised by cytopenias, hypergammaglobulinaemia, multiple autoantibodies and autoimmunity against the Sjogren autoantigen TRIM21/Ro52. To address the key question of causal direction, we created a new mouse model of systemic chronic IFN-alpha elevation, in which Ifna4 is overexpressed by conventional dendritic cells. This model recapitulates key features of the endotype and can be partially reversed by IFNAR1 blockade. INTERPRETATION: Elevation of IFN-alpha drives an immune endotype of Sjogren disease, originating over a decade prior to diagnosis. SjD patients with elevated IFN-alpha concentrations are broadly clinically similar to those with normal IFN-alpha concentrations, yet are immunologically distinct. This highlights the mechanistic heterogeneity of SjD and the need for immunological stratification along precision medicine principles, using high resolution biomarkers.

Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data for yellow and silver eels revealed statistically significant declines in seven of eight datasets, with projected reductions over three generations (24 years) ranging from 79.2% to 99.9%. In contrast, no significant temporal trends were detected in the CPUE of glass eels, likely due to high interannual variability driven by oceanic conditions. The integration of freshwater and coastal data, along with fishery-independent monitoring, enhances the reliability of these indicators. The results provided in this study represent the best currently available indicators of Japanese eel population dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}
{"title": "What uniparental genetic markers tell us about the prehistoric human colonization of the Americas", "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.04.668419", "authors": "Cabrera, V. M.", "abstract": "From the perspective of uniparental markers, the view of the human prehistoric settlement of America is that it resulted from a single main migration after the Last Glacial Maximum, following a period of prolonged stasis in Beringia. These pioneers rapidly expanded across a continent previously uninhabited by humans, forming isolated population groups that became genetically distinct. Ancient DNA studies and whole genome analyses have confirmed this view, revealing a remarkable complexity in the ancestries of the involved populations. In this work, I have reanalyzed all publicly available mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome haplogroups in the American population using simple phylogenetic and phylogeographic methodologies. The results provide a genetic perspective opposed to the currently established model. The arrival of the American settlers occurred more than 30,000 years ago, preceding the LGM. As genomic studies have uncovered, at least two Asian populations contributed to the ancestry of the immigrant population. Low population density and climatic deterioration led to a long period of demographic eclipse, during which small bands of hunter-gatherers made long journeys in search of favorable niches. After the LGM, the climate improved, and demographic expansions occurred in multiple independent centers. The founding and expansion ages of the uniparental haplogroups indicate that these centers were in South America, particularly the Colombian isthmus, the Andean region, the Southern Cone, and the Amazon. Subsequent dispersals occurred in North America, one involving mitochondrial haplogroups A2, C1, and D1, but not B2, and another, of lesser magnitude, represented by the expansion of haplogroups C4c and X2a. This work offers a previously unexplored model for the colonization of the Americas", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

In bacteria, this movement is typically manifested through the presence of bias in the random walk generated by run-and-tumble motility. Often, the chemoattractant is consumed by the organism, thus coupling the biophysical, directed motion with the biochemical, metabolic activity in the growing bacterial colony. In this chapter, we describe our approach to simulating chemotaxis, coupled with detailed metabolic activity within the framework of our modeling software COMETS (Computation of Microbial Ecosystem in Time and Space). By combining genome-scale metabolic models, dynamic flux balance analysis and the newly implemented biophysical chemotaxis model, we built, tested and refined a chemotaxis module for COMETS. We applied this model to an automatically constructed genome-scale model of the plant commensal bacterium Pseudomonas simiae WCS417, which we hypothesized would perform chemotaxis on amino acids similar to its close relative Pseudomonas putida. Through agar plate experiments we confirmed that P. simiae displays chemotaxis to alanine, giving rise to a typical ring pattern. In addition, we used images to infer parameters needed for computer simulations, such as diffusivity and growth rate. Notably, with these parameters, COMETS was able to recapitulate the ring colony pattern, which is due to propagation at the colony front, indicative of bacteria growing on a chemoattractant-filled plate. By allowing for detailed examination of spatial distributions and time dynamics of the biomass, as well as concentration profiles of the metabolites involved in the growth and chemotaxis in bacterial colonies, the software method described here enables simulations of complex microbial patterns involving metabolism and directed motility. Beyond testing the appearance of the ring, future model validation could include comparisons of local growth rates and metabolic fluxes, including rates of metabolite uptake and secretion. The newly added COMETS chemotaxis capability integrates flux balance modeling with gradient-induced biomass propagation, paving the way for more realistic simulations of microbial ecosystem dynamics in complex environments, such as plant roots, where chemotaxis may play a fundamental role in microbiome-host dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Working memory is supported by widespread and distributed brain regions spanning across the cortical hierarchy. However, how working memory content evolves and is transmitted across cortical regions remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the flow of working memory information across the cortex using time-resolved fMRI decoding. Across multiple regions in visual and parietal cortex, we found that decoded working memory content drifted over time from the memoranda towards the later errors in memory reports, consistent with drift-like dynamics predicted by attractor models. These behaviorally predictive neural memory errors emerged earliest in higher-order dorsal visual area (V3AB) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS0), and then later in early visual cortex (V1), suggesting a propagation of mnemonic information originated in higher-level visual area. Inter-areal correlation analyses revealed that during memory maintenance, information flowed predominantly in a top-down manner, from higher to lower visual areas whereas during passive viewing feedforward dynamics prevailed. Together, our findings demonstrate that working memory maintenance involves temporally structured drift dynamics and feedback-dominated information flow across cortical hierarchy, providing a mechanistic link between neural population dynamics and the formation of memory errors.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

The SUDMEX CONN dataset consists of multi-modal MRI, cocaine use metrics, behavioral measures, and demographics of individuals with CUD (N=132, 71 CUD). We identified recurring brain activity states and used NCT to calculate the transition energy (TE) between pairs of states. ANCOVAs examined global and regional TE associations with drug use group (CUD vs controls (NC)), years of CUD, and risk-taking behaviors. We identified potential mechanisms driving the differences by correlating CUD-related regional TE effects with neurotransmitter/receptor systems. People with CUD had significantly lower global TE and default mode, dorsal attention and limbic network TE compared to non-user controls, particularly in regions enriched for noradrenaline and mu opioid receptors. Longer duration of CUD was associated with more decreased global TE, top-down TE, default mode, control and ventral attention network TE, and regional TE enriched for excitatory neurotransmitters and receptors. People with CUD needed to expend more global and top-down TE to perform better on a risk-taking task (the Iowa Gambling task), an effect which was not found in NCs. Our analysis of whole-brain activity dynamics provides a link between the effects of upstream glutamatergic excitotoxicity and/or opioid receptor dysfunction, and downstream weakening of inhibitory control that is central to CUD.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

Genotyping length polymorphic or SNP-rich markers, and various decision algorithms based on match counting or probabilistic approaches may be used for this purpose. In this study, we compared several markers and decision algorithms using samples collected in a therapeutic efficacy study conducted in Rwanda to identify the most suitable and robust approaches for PCR correction. Methods We optimized nested PCR assays to genotype four microsatellites and assessed their sensitivity in detecting minority clones with laboratory parasite strain mixtures. We analyzed patient samples by capillary electrophoresis and amplicon deep sequencing and assessed the diversity and allelic frequency of msp1, msp2, glurp, microsatellites (Poly-, PfPK2, TA40, TA81), and SNP-rich markers (ama1-D2, ama1-D3, cpmp, cpp, csp). We then classified the samples into recrudescence or new infection based on different marker combinations (msp1/msp2/glurp, msp1/msp2/microsatellite, and SNP-rich markers) and three decision algorithms (WHO algorithm, 2/3 algorithm, and a Bayesian approach), and compared our results with previously published findings. Results Among microsatellites, TA40 and PfPK2 had the highest sensitivity in detecting minority clones; however, their intra-assay reproducibility was found to be limited. The 3D7 allelic family of the msp2 gene, glurp and SNP-rich markers had the highest genetic diversity. In distinguishing recrudescence from new infection, the WHO algorithm identified the fewest recrudescences across all marker combinations. Conversely, the 2/3 algorithm identified the highest number of recrudescences, and the algorithm based on Bayesian statistics yielded intermediate results. We observed the least variability in classification results among the different algorithms for the SNP-rich markers ama1-D2/ama1-D3/cpmp combination. In our study, replacing glurp with one of the four analyzed microsatellites or using SNP-rich markers did not significantly alter the final number of recrudescent infections. Interpretation Our findings emphasize the importance of using assays with high sensitivity in detecting minority clones, and markers with high diversity and low allelic frequency for accurate PCR correction. The SNP-rich markers method yielded the most consistent results in detecting recrudescences, regardless of the decision algorithm used. Therefore, it holds great potential for performing reliable PCR correction. Further evaluation of decision algorithms based on probabilistic approaches, compared to match-counting methods, is essential to ensure the accuracy and consistency of PCR-corrected drug efficacy estimations.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

While some of these partly reinvest in research and dissemination and can be considered academia-friendly, non-profit journals - those that fully reinvest revenue into the academic community - often struggle for visibility despite promoting more equitable publishing models. Using citation data from over 70,000 publications in ecology and evolution, we show that citation practices are siloed: for-profit journals disproportionately cite other for-profit journals, academia-friendly journals preferentially cite other academia-friendly journals, and non-profit journals likewise favor citations to non-profit sources. This asymmetry structurally reinforces the IF advantage of for-profit journals simply because they are dominant in the publishing system. To address this inequity, we propose a soft-power, low-risk approach of ''strategic citation''. By deliberately choosing to cite relevant articles from non-profit journals when multiple references would be equally valid, researchers can contribute to increasing those journals visibility and IF. This approach preserves scientific rigor and does not restrict publishing choices, but adds a layer of ethical intentionality to citation practices. Strategic citation offers a practical, actionable lever for researchers to promote a more balanced and ethical publishing system that complements broader structural reforms", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

I.; Croyle, E.; Cadena, D.; Uy, J. A. C.", "abstract": "Replicate hybrid zones between the same taxa provide a unique opportunity to assess the repeatability of interspecific matings by uncovering recurrent genomic and phenotypic introgression patterns. Replicates also facilitate exploration of the causes of temporal shifts in hybrid zone structure. Here we sampled transects along three geographically separate hybrid zones between two avian taxa, the Lemon-rumped (Ramphocelus flammigerus icteronotus) and Flame-rumped (R. f. flammigerus) Tanagers, which hybridize in low passes across the Western Andes of Colombia. We examined environmental, phenotypic and genetic variation using reflectance spectrophotometry and genotype-by-sequencing data mapped to a high quality de novo genome assembly, aiming to assess the repeatability and progression of introgression after hybridization. We found that all hybrid zones formed independently, showed parallel phenotypic divergence along ecological gradients, low population structure across parental ranges and similar demographic histories. Replicates also exhibited asymmetric introgression of neutral markers from the yellow icteronotus into the hybrid zone. However, the age of the hybrid zones differed, resulting in differences in the extent of geographic and genomic cline displacement from environmental transitions into the red flammigerus range. Despite heterogeneity in locus-specific introgression, the only shared introgression outliers across all hybrid zones were in a genomic region linked to plumage color. Clines for these loci were consistently narrow, suggesting a role in long-term reproductive isolation. Altogether, we showed that locus-specific introgression is largely stochastic, but the magnitude and directionality of neutral introgression can be predictable when demographic conditions are similar and for traits involved in reproductive isolation.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}

O.; Tran, H.; Ng, G.; Liu, D.; Abdennur, N. A.", "abstract": "The spatial organization of chromosomes in the nucleus is fundamental to cellular processes. Contact frequency maps from Hi-C and related chromosome conformation capture assays are increasingly available for a wide variety of biosamples and conditions, creating opportunities for comprehensive studies of genome compartmentalization and long-range interactions. However, the conventional dimensionality reduction approach to study long-range contact frequency profiles projects individual datasets into different and incomparable linear subspaces, making the resulting embeddings unsuitable for large-scale integrative analysis. To address this shortcoming and overcome the computational constraints involved in doing so, we introduce an analytic framework and Python toolkit that leverages incremental principal component analysis to project interchromosomal contact frequency profiles across arbitrarily many Hi-C datasets onto a common set of components or basis vectors. Our approach produces robust and directly comparable first and higher-order principal component (PC) scores that collectively capture biologically meaningful information beyond traditional A/B compartments. By applying our framework to a collection of 89 human Hi-C samples, we uncover distinct patterns of nuclear architecture reflecting cell state categories, associated with different heterochromatin state compositions. We also demonstrate that jointly-derived higher-order PCs improve the prediction of gene expression and regulatory element activity during differentiation. Together, our joint decomposition approach provides a powerful and scalable foundation for systematically investigating genome organization, providing critical insights into its role in development and disease.", "date": "2025-08-07", "journal": ""}
