This neurocomputational process is continuously and adaptively calibrated using visual input, as seen in the ventriloquism aftereffect, a shift in sound perception toward a previously seen light. It is unknown from where in the brain this aftereffect originates; adaptation could occur at an early level in the auditory system where neurons are narrowly tuned to frequency, at a later level in the auditory system where localisation cues are extracted, or outside the auditory system at a higher-level spatial map. To investigate this, we examined how the ventriloquism aftereffect generalizes across sound frequencies. Participants localised seven narrowband sounds (0.5 to 8 kHz), targeting different localisation cues. We found that sound localisation accuracy in darkness varied slightly with frequency. When sounds were paired with a visual stimulus that was offset by 10 deg, participants exhibited a pronounced bias toward the light, about ~63%, corresponding to the well-known ventriloquism effect. The bias was stronger for narrowband compared to broadband sounds. After exposure to a block of these audiovisual stimuli, a ventriloquism aftereffect in the form of a spatial bias of ~12% was observed across all tested frequencies, largely independent of the frequency of the exposure sound. These findings indicate that the aftereffect generalizes beyond the specific frequency used during adaptation, suggesting it may stem from adaptation within a multisensory motor map.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

F. V.; Puchenkov, P.; Cali, C.; De Schutter, E.", "abstract": "Astrocytes are now widely accepted as key regulators of brain function and behavior. Calcium (Ca2+) signals in perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs) enable astrocytes to fine-tune neurotransmission at tripartite synapses. As most PAPs are below the diffraction limit, their content in Ca2+ stores and the contribution of the latter to astrocytic Ca2+ activity is unclear. Here, we reconstruct hippocampal tripartite synapses in 3D from a high resolution electron microscopy (EM) dataset and find that 75% of PAPs contain some endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a major calcium store in astrocytes. The ER in PAPs displays strikingly diverse shapes and intracellular spatial distributions. To investigate the causal relationship between each of these geometrical properties and the spatio-temporal characteristics of Ca2+ signals, we implemented an algorithm that generates 3D PAP meshes by altering the distribution of the ER independently from ER and cell shape. Reaction-diffusion simulations in these meshes reveal that astrocyte activity is governed by a complex interplay between the location of Ca2+ channels, ER surface-volume ratio and spatial distribution. In particular, our results suggest that ER-PM contact sites can act as local signal amplifiers if equipped with IP3R clusters but attenuate PAP Ca2+ activity in the absence of clustering. This study sheds new light on the ultrastructural basis of the diverse astrocytic Ca2+ microdomain signals and on the mechanisms that regulate neuronastrocyte signal transmission at tripartite synapses.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

This network can be modeled by cis-regulatory hubs (CRH) which underscore the local functional interactions between enhancers and promoter regions and differ from other higher order chromatin structures such as topological associated domains (TAD). The Activity-by-contact (ABC) model of enhancer-promoter regulation has been recently used in the identification of these CRHs, but little is known about the role of CTCF on the ABC scores and the consequent impact on CRHs. Here we show that the loss of CTCF leads to a reorganization of the enhancer-promoter interactions resulting in a re-distribution of ABC scores of the putative enhancers. The loss of CTCF also leads to a global reduction of the total number of CRHs, and an increase in the size of the CRHs due to increase in the number of elements within each hub. In addition, CTCF loss led to more CRHs that cross TAD boundaries. These results provide another layer of evidence to support the importance of CTCF in the formation of regulatory networks necessary for gene regulation.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Using electron microscopy data in the Drosophila nerve cord, we categorized ~120 GABAergic inhibitory neurons from the 13A and 13B hemilineages into classes based on similarities in morphology and connectivity. By mapping their connections, we uncovered pathways for inhibiting specific groups of motor neurons, disinhibiting antagonistic counterparts, and inducing alternation between flexion and extension. We tested the function of specific inhibitory neurons through optogenetic activation and silencing, using high resolution quantitative analysis of leg movements during grooming. We combined findings from anatomical and behavioral analyses to construct a computational model that can reproduce major aspects of the observed behavior, demonstrating that these premotor inhibitory circuits can generate rhythmic leg movements.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

B.; Genon, S.", "abstract": "The link between brain health and risk/protective factors for non-communicable diseases (such as high blood pressure, high body mass index, diet, smoking, physical activity, etc.) is increasingly acknowledged. However, the specific effects that these factors have on brain health are still poorly understood, delaying their implementation in precision brain health. Here, we studied the multivariate relationships between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and brain structure, including cortical thickness (CT) and grey matter volume (GMV). Furthermore, we adopted a systems-level perspective to understand such relationships, by characterizing the cortical patterns (yielded in association to risk factors) with regards to brain morphological and functional features, as well as with neurotransmitter systems. Similarly, we related the pattern of risk/protective factors dimensions with a peripheral marker of inflammation. First, we identified latent dimensions linking a broad set of risk factors for non-communicable diseases to parcel-wise CT and GMV across the whole cortex. Data was obtained from the UK Biobank (n=7370, age range=46-81 years). We used regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA) embedded in a machine learning framework. This approach allows us to capture inter-individual variability in a multivariate association and to assess the generalizability of the model. The brain patterns (captured in association with risk/protective factors) were characterized from a multi-level perspective, by performing correlations (spin tests) between them and different brain patterns of structure, function, and neurotransmitter systems. The association between the risk/protective factors pattern and C-reactive protein (CRP, a marker of inflammation) was examined using Spearman correlation. We found two significant and partly replicable latent dimensions. One latent dimension linked cardiometabolic health to brain patterns of CT and GMV and was consistent across sexes. The other latent dimension linked physical robustness (including non-fat mass and strength) to patterns of CT and GMV, with the association to GMV being consistent across sexes and the association to CT appearing only in men. The CT and GMV patterns of both latent dimensions were associated to the binding potentials of several neurotransmitter systems. Finally, the cardiometabolic health dimension was correlated to CRP, while physical robustness was only very weakly associated to it. We observed robust, multi-level and multivariate links between both cardiometabolic health and physical robustness with respect to CT, GMV, and neurotransmitter systems. Interestingly, we found that cardiometabolic health and physical robustness are associated with not only increases in CT or GMV, but also with decreases of CT or GMV in some brain regions. Our results also suggested a role for low-grade chronic inflammation in the association between cardiometabolic health and brain structural health. These findings support the relevance of adopting a holistic perspective in health, by integrating neurocognitive and physical health. Moreover, our findings contribute to the challenge to the classical conceptualization of neuropsychiatric and physical illnesses as categorical entities. In this perspective, future studies should further examine the effects of risk/protective factors on different brain regions in order to deepen our understanding of the clinical significance of such increased and decreased CT and GMV.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

In conjunction, we report that local oxytocin receptor-expressing (OTR+) cells are predominantly interneurons, whose activation promotes social interaction. Notably, this prosocial effect persists even under physiological challenge (hunger), pointing to a dedicated prosocial circuit capable of overriding primary survival drives.

The microbiota of insect clades such as high-latitude mosquitoes remain understudied, despite their high abundance and potential economic and medical relevance. Here, we implemented a novel approach combining amplicon-based species identification, microbial quantification and community composition reconstruction, and joint species distribution modelling, to resolve temporal and spatial variation in the abundance and diversity of bacteria and fungi associated with Ochlerotatus (formerly Aedes) mosquitoes across Greenland. COI amplicon data for 573 mosquitoes collected from five regions of Greenland over 15 years enabled the identification of two species, O. nigripes and O. impiger, revealing an overlap in their distributions and limited within-species genetic structure. Quantitative 16S-V4 rRNA amplicon sequencing showed low bacterial densities compared to other insect species, alongside highly variable microbiota composed of environmentally versatile genera, including Janthinobacterium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Escherichia-Shigella. Interestingly, several mosquitoes yielded DNA reads of local vertebrates (likely from blood meals), along with putative vertebrate pathogens such as Bartonella. Fungal communities were low in density and variable in composition, with much of the diversity comprising putative phytopathogens. In contrast, Cladosporium was consistently detected across mosquitoes and controls, indicating likely contamination. Notably, bacterial and fungal communities showed pronounced variation across geographic locations and sampling years, but not between sexes. Together, these findings suggest that Greenland Ochlerotatus mosquitoes do not rely on core microbiota, but engage in flexible associations with diverse, low-abundance microbial communities. They also point to mosquitoes as likely vectors of bacterial and fungal pathogens in the Arctic.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate spontaneous neural activity in the AFP during natural sleep and awake periods in male zebra finches. We found that during sleep, neuron populations in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) spontaneously exhibited synchronized bursts that were characterized by a negative sharp deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. LMAN population bursts occurred primarily during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity observed in rodent hippocampus. We also examined the functional connectivity within the AFP by calculating the pairwise LFP coherence. As expected, delta and theta band coherence within LMAN and Area X was higher during sleep compared to awake periods. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong coherence between LMAN and Area X during sleep, suggesting that the input from LMAN into Area X is spatially restricted. Overall, these results provide the first description of spontaneous neural dynamics within the AFP across behavioral states.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

This raises the question of whether downstream brain regions employ mechanisms to track changes in population activity and thus preserve the fidelity of the information they extract. We show that the statistical properties of drift have a significant impact on such mechanisms. Over an extended period, a net change in population tuning due to drift can arise from an accumulation of small changes distributed across the population, or via abrupt jumps that affect smaller subsets of cells at each time point. We demonstrate that an adaptive readout can exploit the heavy-tailed statistics of abrupt jumps to maintain a more stable readout using a simple inference mechanism. Using experimental data, we investigate the extent to which heavy-tailed drift statistics are observed during representational drift in the posterior parietal cortex and visual cortex. We find that experimentally measured drift does not conform to a Gaussian random walk. Instead, we find sudden jumps in neural tuning that would be advantageous for a downstream observer adapting to changes in representation. These observations motivate future study to determine whether adaptive decoding mechanisms exist in the brain and to determine the physiological mechanisms that shape the statistics of representational drift.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

One such mechanism involves the unconventional secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Vacuole Membrane Protein 1 (VMP1), an autophagy-related protein implicated in pancreatitis, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer, triggers autophagy through ubiquitination and interaction with BECN1. Here, we demonstrate that VMP1 is secreted into the extracellular medium and incorporated into EV membranes. Using cell lines expressing VMP1-tagged plasmids, we isolated VMP1-containing EVs (VMP1-EVs) via ultracentrifugation and immunoisolation. Additionally, VMP1-EVs are internalized by recipient cells. VMP1-EV secretion decreased with mTOR inhibition and in Atg5-deficient cells. In pancreatic acinar cells, endogenous VMP1 secretion increased under stress conditions, including blocked autophagic flux and experimental pancreatitis. In a rat model of pancreatitis, VMP1 secretion in pancreatic juice was increased. TEM and DLS analyses revealed that VMP1-EVs have a diameter of approximately 150 nm. Immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that LC3-II is secreted in VMP1-EVs, with secretion enhanced under lysosomal blockade. Moreover, VMP1 downregulation reduced the secretion of LC3 and p62, indicating that VMP1 is required for their release. This study provides the first evidence that VMP1 is secreted via a secretory autophagy pathway as a component of EVs. Understanding VMP1-mediated secretory autophagy may offer new insights into the clinical relevance of EVs in pancreatic diseases.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

We find that different mice instantiate different patterns of remapping across identically shaped compartments. Within mouse, compartments with more similar predictive navigational histories on a particular spatiotemporal scale are represented more similarly, accounting for these individual differences. Manipulating navigational options induces reorganization of the CA1 structure which specifically resembles the new predictive navigational structure on this scale.

Here we performed simultaneous in vivo local-field potential and multi-unit recordings under light urethane anaesthesia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) of male and female pre-juvenile or adolescent mice, exposed to a resource scarcity model of ELS. We find a developmentally transient low-theta (3-5 Hz) oscillatory hypercoupling within mPFC-BLA networks in pre-juvenile ELS males which seems to result from a precocious development of coupling strength after ELS. In the mPFC, neuronal spiking activity was decreased in pre-juvenile males and the local theta entrainment of spike firing disrupted. In BLA, both sexes showed an increase in firing activity in a subpopulation of neurons after ELS, also confirmed by an increase in {Delta}FosB-positive neurons in BLA, which we identified to be non-GABAergic. Directed interactions, i.e. the ability to entrain spike firing in mPFC to the theta rhythm in BLA and vice versa, were also impaired predominantly in pre-juvenile males after ELS, while females showed a milder phenotype.

P.; Srivastava, M.", "abstract": "Wound healing is a fundamental property of animal life, but the extent to which large injuries can be endogenously repaired varies across phyla. In vertebrates, minor wounds can re-epithelialize on their own, but major wounds often result in imperfect re-epithelialization and fibrotic scarring. In contrast, more regenerative species are capable of both scarless healing and subsequent replacement of missing structures. Due to limitations in many animals' ability to recover from large, multi-tissue injuries, much of our understanding of wound closure comes from experiments studying gaps in epithelial monolayers. In comparison, the mechanisms by which animals can heal large wounds have been characterized primarily at the histological level, usually in non-model species that undergo substantial regeneration after wound healing. Here, we investigate the cellular dynamics of large-scale wound healing in the acoel Hofstenia miamia, an invertebrate worm capable of whole-body regeneration. H. miamia lack a traditional basement membrane and epidermal cells are not separated from underlying muscle by an organized layer of extracellular matrix - making the system incompatible with canonical mechanisms of crawling-based wound healing and raising the possibility that novel mechanisms may be driving closure. By labeling injured animals with an actin dye, we found that H. miamia epidermal cells extend long, actin-rich cytoplasmic protrusions across the wound edge until they reach the nearest epithelial layer and establish cell-cell contact. This process is dependent on muscle contraction; when animals are anesthetized and immobile, they are unable to form these cellular bridges, and epidermal cells cannot migrate independently. At injury sites that lack underlying muscle connecting the wound edge, wounds heal through the formation of organism-wide contractile purse strings. Together, this work identifies mechanisms by which multiple tissue types work together to close large wounds in vivo, indicating a deep conservation of proximate epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in morphogenetic processes.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Yet, how adipocyte size impacts cell function remains unclear as adipocyte size is not tunable with traditional experimental approaches, forcing previous work to rely on correlative studies. Here, we develop protocols to separate primary adipocytes from the same donor into large and small populations and maintain these size-sorted cells in culture. Using these methods, we perform transcriptomic, lipidomic, and functional analyses on large and small adipocytes across two orthogonal mouse models of obesity and validate our results with human clinical samples. Our findings indicate that changes to cell size, rather than global differences mediated by weight gain, drive the transcriptional response of primary adipocytes to obesity. Moreover, large adipocytes shift from a traditional, lipase-mediated mode of lipid release to a non-canonical, extracellular vesicle-mediated mechanism. In functional coculture studies, this change promotes lipid accumulation in neighboring breast cancer cells, increasing their migration and proliferation via enhanced tumor cell fatty acid oxidation. Consistent with our experimental data, human patients with large adipocytes present with greater rates of dyslipidemia and higher concentrations of fasting triglycerides, even when accounting for differences in body mass index. Collectively, our results provide direct evidence that large and small adipocytes from the same donor differ in gene expression, lipid composition, and function with implications for the management of adipose tissue-related pathologies such as breast cancer.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

A key obstacle to progress is the fact that traditional methods for inducing sleep deprivation (SD) in animal models often introduce confounding stress or disrupt circadian rhythms. Here, we present JACUZI-SD (Jetting Automated Currents Under Zebrafish to Induce Sleep Deprivation), a fully automated, high-throughput system designed to induce sleep deprivation in larval zebrafish with minimal stress. By delivering randomized water pulses via a custom milli-fluidic device integrated with a 96-well plate, JACUZI-SD promotes wakefulness during the natural dark cycle without the stress associated with existing SD methods. Our results demonstrate that JACUZI-SD reduces total sleep time by 41-64% and elicits a robust rebound sleep characterized by increased sleep bout length following deprivation. Importantly, this method avoids activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) stress axis, as evidenced by reduced stress marker expression compared to other deprivation methods. Additionally, the system reliably activates established sleep pressure pathways, including the upregulation of galanin in the neurosecretory preoptic area, while also revealing biologically relevant inter-individual variability in homeostatic rebound responses. JACUZI-SD provides a powerful, minimally invasive platform for dissecting the neural and molecular underpinnings of sleep homeostasis in vertebrates.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

A critical component of the stress response is increased noradrenergic tone, acting on lower affinity noradrenergic receptors (1 and {beta}). Noradrenergic signaling is essential for cue-driven behavior, yet how noradrenergic components of the stress response impacts positive and negative reinforcement behavior is still unknown. We manipulated noradrenergic receptor (1, 2, and {beta}) activity during an active avoidance and reward seeking task in male and female rats. We found modulating noradrenergic activity on low affinity 1 and {beta} receptors but not 2 receptors disrupted reinforcement behavior. Increased 1, but to a greater extent {beta} receptor activity shifted negative reinforcement behavior away from active avoidance and towards passive coping by increasing decision thresholds. We also found sex differences in the impact of 1 and {beta} noradrenergic activity on reward seeking. Overall, stress related noradrenergic signaling deceased active avoidance behavior by shifting strategy towards passive coping. Reward seeking was more robust in females but not males. Collectively these results identify sex differences in noradrenergic dependent stress response behaviors and highlight low affinity adrenoreceptors as relevant therapeutic targets to mitigate the impact of stress on goal-directed behavior.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

In the presence of Hebbian plasticity, bursts generate a robust attractor in weight space, creating a built-in drift that can be repurposed into a stabilizing trace of prior learning. We show that this phenomenon can be harnessed for memory consolidation through the introduction of a two-stage synaptic rule. The effective synaptic weight is defined as the product of a primary weight---updated by a Hebbian rule during both tonic and burst periods---and a secondary weight that updates in proportion with a coupling gain to the negative time-derivative of the primary weight. In a MNIST-like task, alternating tonic and burst epochs preserves earlier patterns, improves generalization to unseen inputs, and resists interference and noise, whereas replacing burst by quiescence or additional tonic epochs does not. Parameter sweeps reveal that coupling gain and the initial synaptic weights control whether bursts consolidate (\"up-selection\") or prune (\"down-selection\") synapses. Pairing the rule with alternative primary plasticity models yields distinct treatments of overlapping inputs, enabling either integration or separation. Studying switches in firing activity with a two-stage synaptic plasticity provides a plausible route to consolidation in biological and neuromorphic networks.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

This study investigates auditory brainstem development in Autistic children and adults using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and acoustic startle responses (ASRs), two key measures of auditory processing. We hypothesize that early hypo-responsivity in children, measured with ABRs, may lead to compensatory neural adaptations, resulting in hyper-reactivity in adulthood, measured by ASRs. Methods: The study included 40 Autistic children, 57 non-Autistic children, 20 Autistic adults, and 21 non-Autistic adults. Participants underwent peripheral hearing screening, ABR testing at slow and fast click-rates, and ASR measurements. ABR wave and ASR latencies and amplitudes were analyzed. Statistical analyses included mixed-model ANOVAs and Spearmans correlations to examine group differences and associations with age. Results: Autistic children exhibited increased ABR wave latencies and reduced amplitudes, indicating slower neurotransmission and reduced neural responsivity in the ascending auditory pathway. In contrast, Autistic adults showed normalized ABR latencies but increased ASR magnitude, suggesting hyper-reactivity to auditory stimuli. Age-related correlations revealed that ABR latencies increased with age in non-Autistic participants, while ASR magnitude was negatively correlated with age in non-Autistic participants. The associations were significantly different between groups. Conclusion: The findings support the hypothesis that Autistic children experience auditory brainstem hypo-responsivity, which may normalize in adulthood but lead to maladaptive hyper-reactivity. These results highlight the role of early auditory disruptions in shaping long-term sensory processing and reactivity in Autism, emphasizing the need for further research into the neural mechanisms underlying these differences.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a spatially organized, paracrine IGF1 signaling architecture that regulates human FOXG1 positive NPCs through multilayered transcriptional and translational control. Using a pluripotent stem cell derived forebrain model, we show that FOXG1 positive NPCs express IGF1 receptors but lack endogenous IGF1, instead depending on neighboring epithelial-like domains that secrete IGF1. IGF1 promotes progenitor proliferation, clonal expansion, and vertical tissue growth by activating PI3K AKT mTOR and MEK ERK pathways. Ribosome profiling and 5-UTR reporter assays reveal that mTOR signaling selectively enhances translation of neurodevelopmental and biosynthetic transcripts including GSX1, a ventral fate determinant implicated in interneuron specification and autism. These findings uncover a human-specific regulatory mechanism in which spatially restricted IGF1 mTOR signaling integrates niche signals with translational output to support progenitor identity, biosynthetic capacity, and developmental resilience.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Pmo25 physically and genetically interacted with the myosin-II light chain Cdc4, which is essential for the contractile-ring assembly and function. Additionally, pmo25 mutations had synthetic genetic interactions with all other tested mutations in contractile-ring proteins. Moreover, Pmo25 colocalized with the NDR kinase Sid2 and participated in its recruitment to the division plane. Furthermore, Pmo25 directly bound the Munc13/UNC-13 protein Ync13 and modulated the secretion of glucanase Eng1 to the division site for daughter-cell separation.

Epitope tagging is widely used to study septin localization and function. However, functionality testing of tagged septins is often insufficient because of technical challenges. Fission yeast provides an ideal genetic system to test functionalities and localizations of tagged septins. mEGFP/mYFP tagged septins Spn1 and Spn4 localize exclusively to the division site as double rings during cytokinesis, but tdTomato tagged septins also localize to puncta or short linear structures across the plasma membrane. It was proposed that these additional septin structures serve as diffusion barriers and are important for the localizations and functions of several proteins, including the NDR-kinase Sid2 and active Cdc42 GTPase. By analyzing cell morphology, cytokinesis defects, and genetic interactions between tagged septins and three mutations, we find that septins are less functional with tdTomato or 3HA than other tags. Additionally, Sid2 appearance at the division site is after septins and delayed in septin deletions, contrary to previous reports. Our data re-emphasize the need for rigorous functional tests of tagged septins and for caution in interpreting function and localization data when using epitope tagged septins.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

The model take into account the development of resistance against LO (LOR), and assumes a fixed average delay in latent period per secondary adsorption, with stochastic variability. The model successfully reproduces the experimentally observed multiple peaks in phage production following controlled phage addition. We extend the model to simulate batch culture growth and demonstrate that synchronized collapse of LINed culture can emerge as a collective phenomenon when LOR cells have a high, but finite, LO threshold.

Since age is strongly associated with both brain structure and cognition, predictive models often risk simply capturing age effects. To mitigate this risk, deconfounding is typically applied to remove the effects of age. Here, we propose to treat age instead as a moderator variable, therefore capturing changes in how brain structure and cognitive abilities are statistically connected. For this view to hold, variations in brain structure linked to differences in cognitive performance in older subjects (e.g., related to disease) would differ from those in younger subjects. Using structural brain imaging data from the UK Biobank we found an asymmetry in generalisability: models trained on younger subjects successfully predicted cognition in older subjects, but models trained on older subjects failed to generalise to younger individuals. These findings reveal a trade-off between model specificity and generalisability, suggesting the optimal approach (whether age-specific or pooled) depends on the research or clinical goal for the target population.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Although this technique has seen occasional use in plants, optimization of the protocol to maximize functionality while minimizing organismal stress has not yet been established. Here, we provide evidence for successful implementation through the liquid immersion of seedlings in AHA or HPG-containing media that functions with significantly lower concentrations than the literature standard. Our approach splits acute exposure and incorporation phase of labelling to mitigate potential negative impacts of prolonged NCAA exposure without compromising effective enrichment capacity, and demonstrate that this results in an unperturbed growth phenotype for AHA-treated seedlings.

Mutating a putative sensing/signaling gene had little transcriptomic effect on Rps strain GMI1000 in culture. However, when the mutant grew in tomato over 180 genes were differentially expressed relative to wild type. The gene was therefore named rprR for Ralstonia plant-responsive regulator. In planta, the rprR deletion mutant dysregulated genes for diverse traits including stress response, degradation of phenolic compounds, motility, attachment, and production of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), which is a key bacterial wilt virulence factor. Quantifying Rps EPS by ELISA found increased levels in stems of plants infected with the rprR mutant as compared to wild type. Functional assays showed the rprR mutant is defective in attachment to tomato roots, colonization of tomato stems, and bacterial wilt virulence. In rich medium, the rprR mutant formed biofilm normally, but the mutant formed less biofilm in tomato stem homogenate and in tomato xylem sap under flow. This phenotype correlates with the mutant altered expression of EPS biosynthetic genes and aberrant extracellular matrix. When grown in tomato stem homogenate, the rprR mutant produced 57% more of the bacterial signal cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) than wild type. This is consistent with the presence in RprR of predicted c-di-GMP modulating domains. Together these findings reveal that RprR, which is highly conserved across plant pathogenic Ralstonia, modulates several bacterial wilt virulence traits in response to the plant host.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Combining MAESTRO, single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET), and Bayesian non-parametric FRET (BNP-FRET) enables a high-throughput study of biomolecules under different complexities of multi-axial tension forces. We applied MAESTRO to Holliday junctions (HJs), four-way DNA intermediates that experience multi-directional tension during homologous recombination. Counterintuitively, we discovered >5x slower kinetics of the HJ conformations under multi-axial tension than under tension-free conditions, enabling direct observations of previously hidden HJ conformational intermediates. Most remarkably, we discovered that multi-axial tension restores quasi-ergodicity to HJ dynamics by overcoming the rugged energy landscape, enabling the direct observation of kinetic class interconversion within individual molecules, a phenomenon previously thought impossible, that reveals the conformational landscape is far more interconnected than previously understood and fundamentally challenges existing models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this conformational control regulates T7 endonuclease I cleavage site selection, directly linking mechanical environments and molecular mechanics to enzymatic function.

Understanding the dynamic interaction between the viral life cycle and immune signaling is crucial to designing effective antiviral strategies. Although significant progress has been made, quantitative models that can accurately capture the intricate interactions and the intertwined dynamics during viral infection of cells remain missing. In this study, we develop a comprehensive mathematical model that integrates the intracellular viral life cycle with key cellular innate immune pathways, including RIG-I-mediated detection and JAK-STAT signaling. The model provides mechanistic insights into long-standing observations, capturing both virus-specific dynamics and innate immune response, and the key components driving their coupled dynamics. For example, a comparison of viruses shows how the Japanese Encephalitis virus undergoes a dramatic reduction in viral load in cells, due to its rapid replication that robustly activates the RIG-I pathway, in contrast to the poor immune control of HCV. More importantly, our model demonstrates how virus-host interactions exhibit a sharp bifurcation behavior, where minor differences in immune strength or viral suppression capacity can determine whether infections resolve or persist. We propose that ISG mRNA translation and viral replication predominantly dictate these bimodal infection outcomes. Additionally, the model not only recapitulates but also highlights molecular players involved in IFN desensitization. We demonstrate how our model's ability to capture IFN dynamics allows us to predict optimal timing and dosing strategies for interferon-based prophylactic therapies.

Here, we combined genomic profiling and in vivo assays to investigate OSKM-mediated reprogramming of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

We have used a gain of function model based on pluripotent embryonic ectoderm explants from Xenopus embryos expressing GATA4, to identify a set of downstream targets of GATA4 which are also regulated by Nodal, a known cardiogenic signal. GATA4 was shown to be required for the expression of target genes tbx2 and prdm1 in vivo, likely acting in a direct fashion by interacting with their regulatory regions. In addition, tbx2 and prdm1 are shown to have roles of their own in vivo, as downregulation of tbx2, a positive target, and overexpression of prdm1, a negative target, interferes with cardiac development in Xenopus embryos. The conservation of the GATA4-TBX2-PRDM1 regulatory relationship was shown in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Loss of function of GATA4 lead to downregulation of TBX2, upregulation of PRDM1 expression and failure of cardiogenesis. GATA4-deficient cells failed to form normal cardiomyocytes, with most cells adopting alternative fates and only a small minority expressing an aberrant cardiomyocyte phenotype. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis documented severe reduction of cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell transcriptomes and upregulation of transcriptional profiles of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Disruption of TBX2 function did not alter cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency but led to the formation of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes characterised by defective sarcomeres and deficient calcium signalling. In addition, we show that whilst PRDM1 is not essential for formation of cardiomyocytes it is implicated in suppression of alternative cell fates. The results presented establish a conserved regulatory relationship between GATA4 and its target genes TBX2 and PRDM1 and roles for these genes in the modulation of cardiomyocyte development, expanding the cardiac gene regulatory network and providing further insight into how cardiogenesis proceeds.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Using a grid search of 36 parameter combinations, we evaluated four agronomic traits with a comprehensive suite of metrics: Pearson's r, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Fleiss' {kappa} for stability. Our findings demonstrate that a low learning rate combined with a high number of boosting rounds substantially improves prediction stability (ICC > 0.98) and selection stability (Fleiss Kappa > 0.80), while reducing train-test performance gaps. This combination produced concurrent improvements for predictive accuracy (r) and ranking efficiency (NDCG), though optimal settings were trait-dependent. Conversely, classification accuracy (AUC) was poor and performed relatively better with higher learning rates, revealing a conflict in optimization hyperparameters. Despite moderate Pearson's r and poor AUC in this challenging cross-season, cross-environment prediction scenario, NDCG remained high (> 0.85), indicating strong ability to rank top-performing entries.

Further, the loss of Hb by use of a novel T-lymphocyte-specific Hb knock-out mouse impairs mitochondrial function, dysregulates cytokine production, and lowers the activation threshold primarily in CD4+ T-lymphocytes, indicating a critical role for Hb within this subset. While these data suggested the loss of Hb in T-lymphocytes may promote aberrant activation of autoreactive T-lymphocytes, surprisingly, we discovered that mice lacking Hb in T-lymphocytes exhibited reduced severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) compared to wild-type control animals. Interestingly, T-lymphocytes lacking Hb in vivo appeared to function identically to wild-type controls, which did not explain the protection against EAE. In contrast, T-lymphocyte Hb knock-out mice displayed significantly reduced levels of circulating immunoglobulins and CD40L expression compared to their wild-type counterparts during EAE, suggesting possible impaired intercellular communication. These data elucidate a previously unrecognized role for Hb in T-lymphocyte function, which may have implications for hemoglobin-related diseases (i.e., hemoglobinopathies).", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Thematic coding was used to identify key challenges, opportunities, and best practices to enhance citizen science initiatives. Additionally, nine case studies were reported using the Standardised Data on Initiatives (STARDIT) reporting tool.\n\nThe study identifies key strategies for enhancing participant engagement and retention in citizen science initiatives.

Ensuring data quality and fostering trust require adherence to FAIR data principles, transparent validation and sharing processes, and the establishment of ethical research partnerships. Persistent challenges include short-term funding, which undermines long-term project sustainability, and the lack of centralized support for ethics and project management. Formal recognition of citizen scientists through co-authorship, standardized training, and professional development opportunities can further strengthen involvement and build capacity. Finally, emerging technologies--including AI and open data platforms--present opportunities to scale and improve efficiency, provided they are implemented with appropriate ethical safeguards and investment.\n\nDrawing together these insights, we provide 10 actionable recommendations for citizen science in the 21st century. These highlight the importance of embedding citizen science in national research infrastructure, education, and policy, alongside consistent evaluation and reporting, to improve its inclusivity, longevity, and impact.

V.", "abstract": "The chaotic population dynamics of ecosystems across diverse spatial scales have been extensively investigated over the past three decades. Chaotic fluctuations in species populations, except under specific conditions, have generally been shown to increase extinction risk through cascading effects, environmental noise, and frequent periods of low species density. The persistence of chaotic ecosystems has been attributed to internal and external mechanisms of chaos control, which may be mediated by the ecosystems themselves or by environmental factors such as habitat heterogeneity. However, the control and particularly the quenching of chaos in metacommunities resulting from internal habitat heterogeneity remain unexplored. This study addresses this gap by analyzing the dynamics of a metacommunity composed of five chaotic ecosystems, each located in a distinct patch. The first patch functions as the drive, exerting external influence on the dynamics of the remaining four response patches. Each patch contains an inherently chaotic tritrophic food web, with habitat heterogeneity present among patches. Results indicate that in a drive-response metacommunity, strong influence from the drive quenches dynamical chaos in both drive and response patches, often leading to steady states. This phenomenon is observed in two distinct metacommunity network structures. The heterogeneity of the response systems and the dissimilarity between drive and response systems are found to play significant roles in suppressing chaotic population dynamics. These findings strongly imply that the persistence of inherently chaotic metacommunities may result from the quenching of chaos through the interplay of chaos, habitat heterogeneity, and network structure shaped by dispersal. Furthermore, metacommunities composed of inherently chaotic patches are also susceptible to extinction due to dispersal-induced synchronization. Accordingly, this study also investigates dispersal-induced complete synchronization among the constituent patches of the drive-response metacommunities.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

The types of environmental variables typically used for characterizing habitats in such ecological models, such as precipitation or tree cover, are frequently of low spatial resolution, with a single value for a spatial pixel size of, e.g., 1km2. This spatial scale fails to capture the nuances of micro-habitat conditions that can strongly influence species presence, and additionally, as many of these are derived from satellite data, there are aspects of the environment they cannot capture, such as the structure of vegetation below the forest canopy. We propose to combine high-resolution satellite \\textit{and} ground-level imagery to produce multi-modal environmental features that better capture micro-habitat conditions, and incorporate these multi-modal features into hierarchical Bayesian species occupancy models. We leverage pre-trained deep learning models to flexibly capture relevant information directly from raw imagery, in contrast to traditional approaches which rely on derived and/or hand-crafted sets of ecosystem covariates. We implement deep multi-modal species occupancy modeling using a new open-source Python package for ecological modeling, designed for bridging machine learning and statistical ecology. We test our method under a strict evaluation protocol on 16 mammal species across thousands of camera traps in Snapshot USA surveys, and find that multi-modal features substantially enhance predictive power compared to traditional environmental variables alone. Our results not only highlight the predictive value and complementarity of in-situ samples, but also make the case for more closely integrating deep learning models and traditional statistical ecological models while maintaining their interpretability.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Using gain- and loss-of-function in vivo and in vitro models, we found that glucagon induces sustained expression of PGC-14, promoting lipid uptake and storage in hepatocytes by increasing PPAR{gamma} activity. Increased PPAR{gamma}/PGC-14 promotes hepatic Fsp27/Cidec expression, leading to lipid droplet expansion and triglyceride trapping in liver. Activity of the PPARGC1A alternative promoter and PGC-14 expression were higher in livers of patients with MASLD, and PGC-14 expression correlated with macrosteatosis.

In particular, optical characterization of photosensitive hydrogels like Gelatin Methacrylate (GelMA) provides foundational data for additive manufacturing of complex, tissue-engineered constructs with spatially controlled architecture. GelMA is a promising candidate for use as an injectable hydrogel for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair. This is primarily due to its highly tunable properties, allowing it to mimic tissue. Additionally, GelMA can be optically crosslinked. Optical simulations of this material within the spinal cord can inform whether the cross-linking of this material is feasible and uniform within a particular injury with a chosen exposure paradigm. These simulations require the optical properties of the tissues and materials of interest. However, the optical properties of GelMA have not been studied. The optical properties of GelMA were measured using a double integrating sphere setup and modelled with inverse adding doubling. We measured the absorption coefficient ({micro}a [mm-1]), reduced scattering coefficient ({micro}s[mm-1]), and scattering anisotropy (g [unitless]) for GelMA hydrogels, and examined the effect on these properties when magnetically alignable microstructures were suspended in the hydrogel. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations using these optical properties to determine whether the GelMA hydrogels would be cross-linked under different illumination conditions within a representative spinal cord injury geometry. The depth of hydrogel cross-linking for this representative spinal cord injury geometry was experimentally validated. Overall, it was found that GelMA without rods has an {micro}a = 0.516 {+/-} 0.025 mm-1, with insignificant scattering at 450 nm, GelMA with rods has an {micro}a = 0.588 {+/-} 0.018 mm-1, {micro}s = 0.196 {+/-} 0.024 mm-1, and g = 0.906 {+/-} 0.014 at 450 nm. Additionally, it was observed that in fluid-filled lesions, external illumination is often sufficient to achieve uniform gel curing. In contrast, fibrotic lesions require an intraspinal approach to adequately deliver light throughout the lesion, although the dose distribution will be nonuniform. Finally, experimental results confirmed the simulation findings, showing that when exposing GelMA to 63.29 mW/cm2 of 450 nm light, curing is uniform within the first 4 mm of gel and worsens with depth. These findings support the conclusion that larger volumes of photosensitive GelMA can be feasibly cured within the porcine spinal cord, but an intraspinal exposure will likely be required within human spinal tissue. These findings not only support the feasibility of in situ photopolymerization for SCI repair, but also provide critical optical parameters and validation approaches relevant to bioprinting systems.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we conducted a forward genetic screen and identified X-encoded Host Cell Factor 1 (HCFC1), a member of the COMPASS H3K4 methyltransferase complex, as a dose-dependent XCI-activator. HCFC1 loss results in genome-wide reduction of H3K4me3 at specific regulatory elements and downregulation of nearby genes, including Xist. We show that HCFC1 and YY1 are co-recruited genome-wide to gene regulatory elements. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed an interaction of HCFC1 and YY1 and uncovered the Integrator complex as another prominent YY1 partner. YY1 depletion results in genome-wide loss of Integrator recruitment at gene regulatory elements and reduced expression of nearby genes, including Xist cis-regulatory genes Jpx and Ftx.

Urinary microRNAs (miRNAs), especially exosomal ones, are promising non-invasive biomarkers due to their stability in biological fluids and disease specificity. However, challenges such as population variability, methodological inconsistencies and normalization issues hinder their clinical translation, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches to enhance diagnostic performance. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of urinary exosomal let-7c cluster (let-7c-5p, miR-99a-5p and miR-125b-5p) in BCa patients by integrating miRNA expression data with Machine Learning (ML) models. Methods: Urine samples were collected from 66 participants, including 50 BCa patients and 16 healthy controls (HC). Exosomal miRNAs were isolated and quantified using Quantitative Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (qRT-PCR). Statistical analysis and hypothesis tests were conducted to explore the nature and diagnostic relevance of individual biomarkers. A logistic regression classifier was applied to evaluate both the combined and differential diagnostic capabilities of the selected biomarkers. Accuracy, precision, recall, and AU-ROC scores were used to assess model performance. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify pathways associated with the features prioritized by the ML models, ensuring their relevance to BCa. Results: The result revealed significant differentiation between BCa patients and HC, with miR-99a-5p (p=0.013, AU-ROC=0.71) and miR-125b-5p (p=0.047, AU-ROC=0.64) demonstrating reliable diagnostic performance (let-7c-5p showed weaker discrimination, AU-ROC=0.65, p>0.1). The logistic regression ML model achieved an accuracy of 80.0% (AU-ROC=0.86, recall=100%) in distinguishing cancer from HC and 53.3% (AU-ROC=0.63) when applied to miRNA-only grade classification. When clinical variables were integrated with miRNA expression, performance improved to 73.3% accuracy (AU-ROC=0.61) for high-versus low-grade differentiation. Across Ta-T2, miR-99a-5p displayed relatively better separation, whereas let-7c-5p and miR-125b-5p showed weak stage-related differences. The integration of bioinformatics analysis confirmed the biological relevance of these miRNAs in BCa-related pathways, including PI3K-Akt, p53, NF-{kappa}B and RAS/MAPK signaling, with hub genes such as TP53, MYC, EGFR, and CCND1 identified, further validating the diagnostic utility of the selected biomarkers.

However, the potential risk of uncontrolled spread impedes some applications of gene drive. Daisy chain gene drives have received much attention as a potential approach to overcome this problem. They potentially allow the efficient spread of drive elements in a target population, but are ultimately self-limiting. This is achieved by splitting a normal gene drive system into multiple dependent drive elements, where each element can bias the inheritance of another, except one non-driving element. With the successive loss of each chain link, the spread of transgenic elements will slow down and eventually stop. Here, we use modelling to assess the population dynamics of daisy chain drives in both panmictic and continuous space models, focusing on suppression systems. We find that achieving population elimination through a single release of daisy chain gene drives is possible but difficult, with relatively high requirements for drive performance and release size. These effects are substantially amplified in spatial models. We also constructed two configurations of daisy chain gene drives in Drosophila melanogaster as a proof-of-principle. One is a rescue drive for population modification, and the other aims for population suppression by targeting a haplosufficient female fertility gene. These drives all functioned within expectations at moderate efficiency in individual crosses. However, the drive design failed to spread in cage populations because of higher than expected fitness costs. Overall, our study demonstrates that daisy chain systems may be promising candidates for both modification and suppression, but challenges remain in both construction and potential deployment in large regions.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

After the dry season, soils were rewetted in the laboratory with H218O, and sampled at 0 h, 3 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 168 h post rewet. We quantified CO2 efflux; measured microbial growth and mortality via quantitative stable isotope (18O) probing and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing; and characterized the soil organic carbon chemical composition, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes. We found that reduced winter precipitation imposed a strong legacy effect on microbial turnover; despite maintaining similar respiration rates, microbial growth declined by ~1 order of magnitude, yielding decreased community growth efficiency (CGE = gross community growth/net respiration), and microbial mortality declined by ~ 2 orders of magnitude. Soil organic carbon also shifted from lipid-like, amino-sugar-like, and protein-like compounds (indicative of microbial necromass) to more oxidized lignin-like and tannin-like compounds (indicative of decomposing plant-derived compounds). Meta-omics revealed distinct metabolic strategies linked to CGE. At high-CGE, microbes appeared to consume more energetically favorable N-rich necromass (released via high microbial turnover). This supported increased amino acid and peptidoglycan biosynthesis and enhanced aromatic compound degradation, generating acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle that sustains higher energy yield and growth efficiency. At low-CGE, communities had elevated carbohydrate metabolism and lipid turnover, consistent with increased investment in plant detritus degradation and membrane repair and maintenance rather than growth. Together, our findings demonstrate that reduced winter rainfall decreases microbial turnover. The lowered soil organic carbon in combination with consistent C loss as CO2 could eventually lead to a net C loss from the soil.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

M.; Ganapathy, A.; Kumar, V.; Seshadri, R. A.; Madaboosi, N.; Bose, M.", "abstract": "The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases has been steadily rising in South Asian countries compared to western countries. Microbiome dysbiosis has been strongly associated with CRC development, with diet and demographic factors playing an important role in shaping gut microbial composition. Since most CRC cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, early detection remains critical for improving patient outcomes. Machine learning (ML) approaches provide a promising strategy to identify predictive microbial biomarkers for early CRC detection. In this study, we have analyzed publicly available 16S rRNA datasets comprising CRC patients and controls from South Asian cohorts (India and Sri Lanka) and compared them with Western cohorts (USA). Our findings revealed a higher relative abundance of Prevotella in South Asian cohorts, whereas Bacteroides predominated in the USA cohort. Across all three datasets, Fusobacterium, Escherichia Shigella, and Akkermansia were consistently elevated in CRC cases. We evaluated multiple ML algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LogitBoost, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and proposed stacked ensemble model to differentiate between CRC and controls. Stacked ensemble model has higher accuracy compared to base models. To improve models interpretability and transparency SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis were performed to identify key taxa influencing model predictions. These results underscore the utility of ML based microbiome analysis for identifying robust CRC associated microbial signatures, with potential application in developing generalizable early detection tools.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

While the development and function of exteroceptive circuits and their associated motor pathways are well characterized, far less is known about the circuits that convey viscerosensory inputs to the brain and transmit visceromotor commands from the central nervous system to internal organs. Technical limitations, such as the in utero development of viscerosensory and visceromotor circuits and the invasiveness of procedures required to access them, have hindered studies of their functional development in mammals. Using larval zebrafish, which are genetically accessible and optically transparent, we tracked, in vivo, how cardiosensory and cardiomotor neural circuits assemble and begin to function. We uncovered a staged program. First, a minimal efferent circuit suffices for heart-rate control: direct brain-to-heart vagal motor innervation is required, intracardiac neurons are not, and heart rate is governed exclusively by the motor vagus nerve. Within the hindbrain, we functionally localize a vagal premotor population that drives this early efferent control. Second, sympathetic innervation arrives and enhances the dynamics and amplitude of cardiac responses, as neurons in the most anterior sympathetic ganglia acquire the ability to drive cardiac acceleration. These neurons exhibit proportional, integral, and derivative-like relationships to heart rate, consistent with controller motifs that shape gain and dynamics. Third, vagal sensory neurons innervate the heart. Distinct subsets increase activity when heart rate falls or rises, and across spontaneous fluctuations, responses to aversive stimuli, and optogenetically evoked cardiac perturbations, their dynamics are captured by a single canonical temporal kernel with neuron-specific phase offsets, supporting a population code for heart rate. This temporally segregated maturation isolates three experimentally tractable regimes, unidirectional brain-to-heart communication, dual efferent control, and closed-loop control after sensory feedback engages, providing a framework for mechanistic dissection of organism-wide heart-brain circuits.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Radial glia (RG) neural stem cells shape cortical cell diversity by giving rise to excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, as well as olfactory bulb interneurons (INs) and a recently characterized population of cortical INs. Complex genetic programs orchestrated by transcription factor (TF) circuits govern the balance between self-renewal and differentiation, and between different cell fates. Despite progress in measuring gene regulatory network activity during human cortical development, functional studies are required to evaluate the roles of TFs and effector genes in human RG lineage progression. Here we establish a human primary culture system that allows sensitive discrimination of cell fate dynamics and apply single cell clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) screening to examine the transcriptional and cell fate consequences of 44 TFs active during cortical neurogenesis. We identified multiple TFs, with novel roles in cortical neurogenesis, including ZNF219, previously uncharacterized, that represses neural differentiation and NR2E1 and ARX that have opposing roles in regulating RG lineage plasticity and progression across developmental stages. We also uncovered convergent effector genes downstream of multiple TFs enriched in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and observed conserved mechanisms of RG lineage plasticity across primates.

These spatially explicit estimates were incorporated into an agent-based model simulating human demographic dynamics under various scenarios. Results indicate that carrying capacity changes cannot explain Neanderthal extinction at a continental scale, though they are essential to understanding spatiotemporal distribution patterns of both human species. Conversely, the arrival of H. sapiens increased Neanderthal extinction likelihood without requiring a selective advantage. Due to the successive demographic expansions and contractions, group connectivity emerges as the key factor shaping population stability in both species.

However, the effect of mutation bias relative to other factors influencing adaptation remains unclear. By experimentally evolving wild type and mutator E. coli strains in different growth media, we show that mutation bias reversal facilitates early adaptation, altering the genetic basis of adaptation and the type of mutations accumulated under selection. Together, mutation bias, mutation rate, and initial fitness correctly predicted relative adaptation rates for any pair of strains.

We present a cross-species analysis of alternative splicing (AS) across six tissues in 26 mammals, identifying hundreds of conserved AS events significantly associated with MLS, with the brain containing twice as many tissue-specific events as peripheral tissues. MLS-AS events are enriched in pathways related to mRNA processing, stress response, neuronal functions, and epigenetic regulation, and are largely distinct from genes whose expression correlates with MLS, indicating that AS captures unique lifespan-related signals. The brain exhibits certain associations divergent from peripheral tissues and reduced overlap with body mass (BM)-associated splicing; neither is observed at the gene expression level. While MLS- and age-associated AS events show limited overlap, the shared events are enriched in intrinsically disordered protein regions, suggesting a role in protein flexibility and stress adaptability. Furthermore, MLS-associated AS events display stronger RNA-binding protein (RBP) motif coordination than age-associated ones, highlighting a more genetically programmed adaptation for lifespan determination, in contrast to the more variable splicing changes seen with chronological aging. These findings suggest alternative splicing as a distinct, transcription-independent axis of lifespan regulation, offering new insights into the molecular basis of longevity.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting 'spacetime attractor' excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Yet our understanding of the neural substrates underlying continuous speech perception relies largely on neural responses to monologues, leaving substantial uncertainty about how social interactions shape the neural encoding of speech. Here, we bridge this gap by studying how EEG responses to speech change when the input includes a social element. Specifically, we compared the neural encoding of synthesised undirected monologues, directed monologues, and dialogues in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, we extended this by using podcasts, addressing the additional challenges of real speech dialogue, such as dysfluencies. Using temporal response function analyses, we show that the presence of a social component strengthens envelope tracking - despite identical acoustic properties - indicating heightened listener engagement. Neural responses to synthesised speech showed a strong correlation with those for real speech podcasts, with a stronger alignment emerging for more socially-relevant speech material. In addition, we demonstrate that robust neural indices of sound and lexical-level processing can be derived using real podcast recordings despite the presence of dysfluencies. Finally, we discuss the importance of dysfluency in social speech experiments, presenting a simulation quantifying the potential impact of dysfluency on lexical level analyses.

Background: NTG is a primary open-angle glaucoma subtype characterised by glaucomatous neurodegeneration without elevated intraocular pressure. Increasing evidence links systemic metabolic and oxidative stress vulnerability to NTG pathophysiology, making non-ocular, somatic cells promising surrogate systems for assessing neurodegenerative predisposing mechanisms. Methods: Skin fibroblast cultures were obtained from four female NTG and four age- and gender-matched control donors. Targeted metabolic profiling of mitochondrial function, glycolytic capacity, and glucose and amino acid metabolism was performed using the seahorse assay, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Oxidative stress resilience to hydrogen peroxide was assessed employing the lactate dehydrogenase release assay. Results: Pure skin fibroblast cultures were obtained for all included donors. NTG and control fibroblast exhibited similar mitochondrial and glycolytic function. No group difference was demonstrated in relative glucose metabolism and absolute amino acid profile. Control and NTG fibroblasts exhibited similar susceptibility to oxidative stress. Conclusion: NTG skin fibroblasts exhibit similar mitochondrial and glycolytic function, glucose metabolisation, amino acid profile, and oxidative stress resiliency compared to controls. Future studies should focus on mapping cell- and tissue-specific differences through combined genetic and transcriptomic profiling to guide and stratify the functional assessment of different endotypes within the NTG disease spectrum.

Purpose Endoscopic spine surgery (ESS) has gained substantial traction globally. Proficiency in ESS demands a steep learning curve and rigorous technical training. This study aims to develop and validate a porcine model as a high-fidelity, reproducible platform for hands-on training in lumbar endoscopic procedures. Methods Thirteen skeletally mature Landrace x Large white pigs underwent lumbar endoscopic decompression via a transforaminal approach at L4-L5 and an interlaminar approach at L5-L6. Specific procedural modifications were introduced to optimize anatomical correlation and surgical ergonomics. Following a seven-day postoperative period, necropsies were performed to evaluate procedural outcomes and adverse events. Operative times, intraoperative events, and postoperative outcomes were systematically recorded. Results Endoscopic decompression was successfully completed in all specimens. Mean operative time was 134.7 {+/-} 32.3 minutes. Intraoperative complications occurred in 4 animals (30.8%): uncontrollable epidural bleeding (case 1), dural tear (case 7), technically difficult transforaminal access in a low-weight pig (33.8 kg, case 8), and a complex interlaminar approach leading to spinal cord injury (case 13). One additional animal (case 4) developed paraplegia without structural findings at necropsy, attributed to intraoperative positioning. Necropsy revealed asymptomatic epidural hematomas in three cases (9, 11, 12). Three animals (23.1%) required early euthanasia based on humane criteria.

N.", "abstract": "Many peptides and proteins self-assemble into large fibrillar aggregates, reaching sizes of several micrometers. This process typically involves nucleation, formation of transient oligomeric species ranging from dimers to assemblies comprising hundreds of monomers. The roles of these heterogeneous oligomers in initiating fibril growth vary significantly, as only a subset converts into primary nuclei, the smallest assemblies capable of spontaneous elongation. Consequently, the initial stages of peptide aggregation remain a critical challenge in elucidating amyloid fibril formation. Here, we analyze the aggregation lag time as a function of initial peptide concentration, employing linear regression on a double logarithmic scale to derive the critical nucleus size from the slope. We compare potential shifts in kinetic regimes with critical concentrations associated with the assembly of larger oligomers. Although peptide length has no clear correlation with nucleus size, extended helical regions may promote the formation of larger nuclei, stabilizing preliminary oligomers and prolonging the lag phase. We quantified the contributions of higher-order oligomers as on- and off-pathway species across multiple peptides, identifying a common critical micelle concentration range. We prove that linear growth models can not capture the weak concentration dependence of lag times for several peptides. We demonstrate that the inclusion of capping and fragmentation mechanisms substantially improves the plausibility of the model.

Forty-five Holstein cows were divided into three groups: control group (n = 15), vitamin E group (n = 16) (3,000 IU/d for 3 weeks before and 1,000 IU/d after calving), and plant extract group (n = 14) (10 g/d only after calving). Their redox and immune status were monitored during the first 12 weeks of lactation, every four week. In week 12, plasma malondialdehyde levels in plasma were lower in the vitamin E and plant extract groups than in the control group. The vitamin E and plant extract groups had lower ex vivo plasma CCL4, IL6 and IL8 cytokine levels, lower proportions of blood regulatory neutrophils, and less ROS production by blood neutrophils than the control group. In terms of immune response, vitamin E and plant extracts down-regulated the gene expression of FABP3 in the milk mammary epithelial cells of multiparous cows. Therefore, supplementation with either vitamin E or plant extracts could prevent systemic hyper-inflammation and improve the immune response during early lactation.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

This study examined how ageing and diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) affect the sensitivity and precision of thermal perception and whether combining these parameters can aid in distinguishing patients from healthy controls. Using a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach, we estimated psychometric function thresholds (sensitivity) and slopes (precision) for cold detection, warm detection, cold pain, and heat pain in 86 healthy adults (aged 21-80) and 34 patients with DPN. We assessed age- and neuropathy-related effects on these parameters. Using simulated classification analyses, we also tested their utility in discriminating patients from controls. Ageing was associated with elevated detection and cold pain thresholds and reduced precision of cold detection. Patients with DPN showed similar patterns: higher detection thresholds and lower cold detection slopes while pain-related parameters were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that ageing and neuropathy produce qualitatively similar changes in thermosensory function, particularly affecting cold detection sensitivity and precision. Classification based on detection thresholds and cold detection slope successfully discriminated patients from controls, with cold detection slope offering the best performance. Combining threshold and slope parameters did not significantly improve classification accuracy. Accurate classification was not possible based on pain thresholds and slopes. Modelling both thresholds and slopes provides a more comprehensive view of sensory decline and may enhance the detection of early or subtle sensory dysfunction.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Social information transmission has been observed amongst individuals in fish schools, bird flocks, and human groups, but the neural mechanisms for detecting socially transmitted information are poorly understood. By studying the schooling glassfish Danionella cerebrum, here we demonstrate that escape from danger is enhanced by visual perception of other escaping fish. We found that neural populations in the midbrain optic tectum and dorsal thalamus are activated by the rapid escape of social partners. These neurons are also driven by the sudden disappearance of virtual social partners, yet unaffected by disappearing stimuli without social relevance. Virtual fish schools that escape or disappear were sufficient to cause observers to escape, even in the absence of direct threats. These results demonstrate that rapid social-off detection in visual circuits enables the detection of socially transmitted threat information, which may be a particularly effective strategy for animals capable of rapid movement but limited visual range. These results show how neural computations in individuals enables rapid information sharing in animal collectives.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Cortical lesions can disrupt the body schema; however, it remains unclear how the cortex efficiently represents the vast repertoire of body postures during natural behavior. Here, we unveil the representational format underlying the body schema by combining large-scale electrophysiology with 3D full-body motion capture in freely moving mice. Across posterior parietal (PPC) and sensorimotor cortices (SMC), neurons encoded diverse postural features in distinct reference frames: PPC neurons emphasize midline-referenced features related to left-right turning, whereas SMC neurons encode body elevation and pitch relative to the ground, revealing a gravicentric reference frame. Strikingly, beyond static posture encoding, we identified neural ensembles selectively activated during stereotyped actions such as walking, rearing, and grooming. These action ensembles fire in phase-locked sequences that tile the entire action cycle, providing a substrate for action awareness. A network model recapitulated these dynamics, showing that population activity clustered into action-specific subspaces. Together, these findings demonstrate that the cortex organizes the body schema around actions, compressing high-dimensional kinematics into an efficient, gravity-anchored, and action-aware neural code.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

The dynamic of incoming 3'-cRNA template is limited by the priming and realignment loop (PR loop), which facilitates the cRNA template realignment process.

The three phage defense systems co-occur in 426 E. coli strains comprising 66 distinct serotypes, including 277 O157:H7 isolates and 117 diverse non-pathogenic strains. Efficiency of plating (EOP) assays were used to explore the phage spectrum and synergy of the three defense systems and their contribution to the phage resistance of strain EDL933 {Delta}stx1/2. Using {Delta}zorABE,{Delta} druHE, and {Delta}armABCD single system deletion mutants in EDL933 {Delta}stx1/2, we showed that Druantia III and ARMADA II protect to different extents against a broad spectrum of phages, including the Drexlerviridae, Siphoviridae, Demerecviridae, Vequintavirinae and Autographiviridae, but not against hypermodified Tevenvirinae. Additionally, Zorya II caused strong protection only against Autographiviridae. Furthermore, EOP assays of combined system mutants revealed strong synergistic interactions of Druantia III and ARMADA II to provide more robust immunity against a similar phage spectrum than the additive protection of the individual systems. In contrast, Druantia III and Zorya II act only weakly synergistically against a few phages. Altogether, our results revealed that Druantia III and ARMADA II are responsible for most of the phage resistance of EDL933 {Delta}stx1/2, whereas Zorya II provides additional immunity against podoviruses.

However, many genetic regulators of T cell performance in solid tumors may not be readily revealed in vitro. In vivo screening in tumor-bearing mice offers greater physiological relevance, but has historically been limited by low intratumoral T cell recovery. Here, we developed a new model system that achieves significantly higher human T cell recovery from tumors, enabling genome-wide in vivo screens with small numbers of mice. Tumor-infiltrating T cells in this model exhibit hallmarks of dysfunction compared to matched splenic T cells, creating an ideal context for screening for genetic modifiers of T cell activity in the tumor microenvironment. Using this platform, we performed two genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens to identify genes regulating T cell intratumoral abundance and effector function (e.g., IFN-{gamma} production). The intratumoral abundance screen uncovered the P2RY8-G13 GPCR signaling pathway as a negative regulator of human T cell infiltration into tumors. The effector function screen identified GNAS (Gs), a central signaling mediator downstream of multiple GPCRs that sense different suppressive ligands, as a key regulator of T cell dysfunction in tumors. Targeted GNAS knockout rendered T cells resistant to multiple suppressive cues and significantly improved therapeutic performance across diverse solid tumor models. Moreover, combinatorial knockout of P2RY8 (trafficking) and GNAS (effector function) further enhanced overall tumor control, demonstrating that genetic modifications targeting distinct T cell phenotypes can be combined to improve therapeutic potency. This flexible and scalable in vivo screening platform can be adapted to diverse tumor models and pooled CRISPR libraries, enabling future discovery of genetic strategies that equip T cell therapies to overcome barriers imposed by solid tumors.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

How IRF2 activates some proinflammatory genes, but suppresses others is unclear. We show that skin inflammation in Irf2-deficient mice is driven by IRF1 activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Chromatin profiling revealed that IRF1 and IRF2 occupy the same ISG regulatory sites, but as a weaker transcriptional activator, IRF2 limited ISG transcription by IRF1. Toll-like receptor signaling favored IRF1-driven transcription by inducing Irf1. In addition, IRF1 recruited the ubiquitin ligase SPOP to ISG sites, resulting in proteasomal degradation of IRF2. This shift from IRF2 to IRF1 occupancy enhanced ISG transcription. Collectively, these findings define a hierarchical transcriptional circuit in which IRF2 limits IRF1 activity under homeostatic conditions but is displaced during an immune response, allowing IRF1-dependent gene programs central to innate immunity and autoinflammation.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

One such example is the amino acid cysteine, whose reactive thiol group is exploited for diverse cellular functions. Here, by characterizing the machinery required for the conditional degradation of cysteine dioxygenase type I (CDO1), the critical enzyme responsible for cysteine catabolism, we identify a Cul2 E3 ligase complex containing the uncharacterized substrate adaptor LRRC58 that is sensitive to cysteine abundance. When cysteine is replete, LRRC58 activity is restrained through auto-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation; upon cysteine deprivation, LRRC58 is stabilized to permit CDO1 degradation. Through saturation mutagenesis stability profiling, we systematically validate a structural model of the CDO1-LRRC58 interaction and identify residues at the LRRC58 C-terminus required for cysteine-dependent instability. The LRRC58-mediated degradation of CDO1 is essential to prevent ferroptotic cell death under conditions of cysteine scarcity, and mutations in CDO1 which cause neurodevelopmental defects in humans encode dominant-active proteins refractory to LRRC58 recognition.

We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors.

Here, we introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that reconstructs PMF from surrogate signals including NADH, oxygen, electron flux, proton leak, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Using a synthetic curriculum dataset derived from biophysical ranges reported in the literature, our model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2; 0.99, RMSE < 1 mV) under normoxia and hypoxia. SHAP-based interpretability revealed distinct feature contributions: flux and NADH dominated under normoxia, while oxygen and ROS became more influential under hypoxia. Extended analyses demonstrated that PINNs generalize robustly across cross-validation folds, preserve biophysical constraints, and can be adapted to time-series dynamics, capturing PMF decline and recovery during simulated hypoxia-reoxygenation. To our knowledge, this is the first application of PINNs to mitochondrial bioenergetics, bridging machine learning with the chemiosmotic theory.

Chronic oral exposure of Sprague-Dawley rats to PET-MPs (1.0-100 mg/L) resulted in endothelial glycocalyx loss and structural impairment of aortic elastic fibers, with MPs accumulating within aortic endothelial cells. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses revealed that PET-MPs triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), driving glycocalyx degradation and NF-kappaB-mediated inflammation. Proteomic profiling identified endothelial-derived IL-1beta as a key mediator, which subsequently induced phenotypic switching in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in vitro. Pharmacological inhibition of ERS (TUDCA), ROS (NAC), or IL-1beta (Canakinumab) attenuated this pathogenic cascade.

A marked increase in GCaMP activity was detected beginning on the afternoon of proestrus that lasted in total for 13{+/-}1 hours. This was comprised of slow baseline oscillations with a period of 91{+/-}4 min and associated with high frequency rapid transients. Very little oscillating baseline or transient activity was detected at other stages of the estrous cycle.

Minimal patterned GCaMP activity was found in OVX mice, and this was not changed acutely by any of the estradiol treatments. However, on the afternoon of the expected LH surge, the same oscillating baseline activity with associated transients occurred for 7.1{+/-}0.5 h.

We generated transcriptomes for the new species and inferred a phylogeny for 70 species of Caenorhabditis, based on 2955 genes. This phylogeny allowed us to perform the first quantitative biogeographic analysis for the group. Our analysis suggests that the deep ancestors of the Elegans Supergroup of species lived in the Americas, and that the Supergroup's subsequent diversification occurred in Remote Oceania. The ancestors of the Supergroup gave rise to a diverse Oceanian fauna and ultimately to multiple lineages that moved into Asia, Africa, Australasia, and back into the Americas.

The Drosophila innate immune system deploys a large transcriptional induction of signaling proteins, anti-microbial effectors, and other critical immune factors. This transcriptional response is encoded in enhancers, cis-regulatory sequences that modulate gene expression by binding transcription factors (TFs). While enhancers and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) have been identified for several immune responsive genes in Drosophila, most enhancers that regulate immune-induced genes are unknown. By identifying enhancers, we can understand how their composition controls expression and contributes to infection outcome. We employed STARR-seq (Self Transcribing Active Regulatory-Region sequencing) in a hemocyte-like cell line to identify immune-specific enhancers across the D. melanogaster genome and performed ATAC-seq in hemocytes extracted from adult flies to assess the chromatin state of these enhancers before and after immune stimulus. We identified thousands of enhancers responsive to IMD stimulation, one of the two primary immune signaling pathways in Drosophila. As expected, immune enhancers are enriched for motifs of Relish, an NF-kB factor, and Kay/Jra, a bZip heterodimer pair, involved in the Imd and JNK pathways respectively, compared to enhancers active in unstimulated cells. However, when grouping enhancers by their target gene's expression timing or functional role or by the enhancers' chromatin accessibility pre- or post-stimulus, different groups of TFBS motifs are enriched, suggesting distinct regulatory logic for different parts of the immune response. Identification and characterization of the diverse array of enhancers that regulate the innate immune response expands our understanding of how animals fight infections.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

In the laboratory, naive mice explore their environment via highly structured trajectories and can learn to localize new spatial targets in as few as a handful of trials. It is unclear how such efficient learning is possible, since existing computational models of spatial navigation require far more experience to achieve comparable performance and do not attempt to explain the evolving structure of animal behavior during learning. To inform a new algorithm for rapid learning of navigational goals, we took inspiration from the reliable structure of behavior as mice learned to intercept hidden spatial targets. We designed agents that generate behavioral trajectories by controlling the speed and angular velocity of smooth path segments between anchor points. To rapidly learn good anchors, we use Bayesian inference on the history of rewarded and unrewarded trajectories to infer the probability that an anchor will be successful, and active sampling to trim hypothesized anchors. Agents learn within tens of trials to generate compact trajectories that intercept a target, capturing the evolution of behavioral structure and matching the upper limits of learning efficiency observed in mice. We further show that this algorithm can explain how mice avoid obstacles and rapidly adapt to target switches. Finally, we show that this framework naturally encompasses both egocentric and allocentric strategies for navigation.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Traditional predictions often rely on small, healthy cohorts, excluding vulnerable populations. Using computational models of realistic heart anatomies and electrophysiology, we generated a virtual cohort of 512 subjects across healthy and diseased hearts (heart failure, dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ischaemia, and myocardial infarction). We assessed QT prolongation and arrhythmic events following administration of moxifloxacin (benchmark antibiotic) and contraindicated drugs including quinidine, bepridil, and flecainide. Patients with heart failure, hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy showed greater QT prolongation to moxifloxacin, unlike ischaemia and myocardial infarction, which resembled healthy subjects. Females exhibited consistently higher QT prolongation than males. Contraindicated drugs markedly increased arrhythmia risk in populations with heart failure, dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and ischaemia, frequently leading to lethal arrhythmias such as Torsades des Pointes or ventricular fibrillation, particularly in females.

R.; Wang, H.", "abstract": "Real-time sleep stage classification is important for closed-loop neuromodulation at certain stages during sleep, yet current models often yield noisy and unstable outputs that risk false triggers. These fluctuations, especially near stage boundaries, can compromise the safety and reliability of stimulation. Existing methods frequently rely on model-specific architecture or require extensive tuning to maximize precision, which limits their generalizability and hinders deployment in real-time systems. To address this, we propose a lightweight, classifier-independent post-processing pipeline that stabilizes predictions without modifying the underlying classifier. Our method first applies temporal smoothing to predicted sleep-stage probabilities, followed by conservative control logic to enhance stimulation precision. We evaluate four smoothing techniques: Moving Average (MA), Exponential Smoothing (ES), Kalman Filtering (KF), and a novel Weighted Exponential Smoothing (WES), on a 29-subject open-source sleep dataset. To capture the trade-offs between stability and responsiveness, we introduce new real-time evaluation metrics. We identify an optimal smoothing intensity range and assess three control strategies: probability thresholding, naive waiting, and entropy constraint, as well as a hybrid method combining high confidence and low uncertainty. Smoothing improves generalization and robustness: under both low and high synthetic noise ({sigma} > 0.2), smoothed outputs retain 10-15% higher precision and recall across all stages. Control logic further enhances reliability: our hybrid method achieves 80% (Wake), 96% (N2), 98% (N3), and 86% (REM) precision. Finally, we introduce a state transition constraint matrix to suppress biologically implausible transitions (e.g., REM[-&gt;]N3), to further stabilize outputs during evidence accumulation, with potential applications in objective sleep quality assessment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically characterize real-time trade-offs between smoothing, latency, and control logic in sleep staging. Overall, our generalizable framework is expected to improve safety, interpretability, and deployment feasibility of real-time sleep classification for both clinical and wearable closed-loop neuromodulation systems.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

More specifically, ST131 clade C (ST131-C) is associated with fluoroquinolone resistance and extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamases (ESBLs). Even though urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a known common precursor to BSIs, there is currently limited knowledge on the longitudinal prevalence of ST131-C in UTIs and, therefore, the temporal link between the two infection types. Leveraging available genomic and antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) data for ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and ceftazidime in 2790 E. coli BSI isolates, we trained random forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers to predict if an E. coli isolate belongs to ST131-C using only AST data. These models were used to predict the yearly prevalence of ST131-C in 22942 UTI and 24866 BSI isolates from Norway. The XGBoost classifier achieved a prediction F1-score of over 70% on a highly unbalanced dataset where only 4.3% of the genomic BSI isolates belonged to ST131-C. The predicted prevalence of ST131-C in UTIs exhibited a similar annual trend to that of BSIs, with a stable infection burden for eight years after its rapid expansion, confirming that the persistence of ST131-C in BSIs is largely driven by ST131-C UTIs. However, a higher prevalence of ST131-C in BSIs (~7%) compared to UTIs (~4%) suggests a subsequent enrichment of ST131-C.

Single-cell transcriptomics offers a powerful framework to dissect mutant cell states, yet direct genotyping is hampered by data sparsity and often requires costly, labor-intensive approaches. To overcome this limitation, we developed SpliceUp, a computational tool that identifies splice factor-mutant cells through their aberrant RNA splicing signatures.

Here, we present a deep learning framework that predicts protein flexibility directly from static structural descriptors, bypassing the need for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Using the ATLAS database of standardized all-atom MD trajectories, we encoded 1,374 protein chains as 30-dimensional Gaussian integral (GI) vectors, global shape and topology invariants of the protein backbone. Principal component analysis of GI profiles revealed four structural clusters with distinct secondary structure compositions and flexibility distributions. We trained an attention-based one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) to classify proteins as flexible or non-flexible based on their root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) relative to the dataset-wide mean. The classifier achieved an AUC of 0.772 (95% CI: 0.712-0.826) on an independent test set, with balanced sensitivity and specificity, and identified a small subset of GI components as the most predictive. In a regression setting, a recurrent neural network outperformed other architectures, attaining an R2 of 0.537, though high-flexibility values were systematically underestimated. Cluster-specific analyses indicated that coil-rich and {beta}-sheet-dominated proteins were more amenable to flexibility prediction than -helical proteins, likely due to greater structural heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that compact GI descriptors preserve sufficient information to recover MD-derived flexibility trends, offering a computationally efficient complement to simulation-based approaches.

In this study, we examined the response of U2OS osteosarcoma cells to substrates of varying stiffness, with a particular focus on cytoskeletal remodeling, cell elasticity, and microparticle internalization. To simulate environments of moderate and high stiffness, cells were cultured on polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogels with a stiffness of 40 kPa and on rigid glass substrates, respectively. Changes in cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization were assessed using fluorescence microscopy, while cell mechanical properties were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). To investigate the relationship between substrate mechanics and endocytic activity, carboxylated fluorescent 2 micrometer latex microspheres were introduced to the cell culture system. Our study showed that cell spreading increased with substrate stiffness. U2OS cells cultured on glass exhibited a significantly larger surface area, more actin stress fibers, and a more organized, stretched cytoskeletal architecture compared to cells grown on 40 kPa PA gels. AFM measurements further demonstrated that cells on glass were mechanically stiffer than those on PA substrates. Microparticle uptake was also strongly influenced by substrate stiffness. Cells cultured in the 40kPa PA gels internalized a significantly greater number of fluorescent microspheres. Notably, these cells frequently formed distinct, cup-like structures composed of microtubules around the beads. Three-dimensional image reconstructions revealed that these structures encapsulate the particles in an asymmetrical manner, indicative of active cytoskeletal remodeling. To better understand the molecular composition of these microtubule-based structures, we analyzed the localization of selected microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), including IQGAP1, CLIP1, and MARK2 (Conboy J.P. et al. 2024). Interestingly, only IQGAP1 was localized prominently to the microtubule cups on 40kPa gels, often forming ring-like structures surrounding the beads. In some cases, these rings were observed independently of detectable microtubules, suggesting the involvement of an active, possibly microtubule-initiated, endocytic process. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that substrate stiffness modulates multiple aspects of U2OS cell behavior, including morphology, cytoskeletal arrangement, mechanical properties, and microparticle uptake. These results underscore the mechanosensitive nature of osteosarcoma cells and highlight novel roles for microtubule structures and MAPs, particularly IQGAP1 in stiffness-dependent cellular uptake mechanisms.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

The thaumarchaeal 3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA Synthetase (ADP-forming; Nmar_1309) is crucial to this efficiency, utilizing ATP to ADP catalysis. This first reported structure of Nmar_1309 reveals a homodimer with a unique subdomain organization ([3-4-1-2-5]) and a distinct linker between subdomains 4 and 1. The presence of bound substrates including 3-hydroxypropionate, non-hydrolyzable ATP (ADPNP), and a phosphate suggests an intermediate state mimicking a reaction step immediately preceding the formation of a 3-hydroxypropionyl-phosphohistidine. Conformational differences were observed between the two chains of the homodimer, likely influenced by the binding of a single ADPNP molecule in one chain. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that while 4HB synthetases may have evolved earlier in the evolutionary timeline, 3HP synthetases in Thaumarchaeota may have occurred after the Great Oxygenation Event. These structural data provide further characterization of the 3HP/4HB cycle and, in conjunction with the structure of 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthetase, Nmar_0206, provide baseline structures of the key ADP-forming Acyl-CoA synthetases within this pathway.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Here we demonstrate that, unexpectedly, the induction of AXIN puncta represents a major barrier to achieving therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, catalytic inhibition of TNKS prevents TNKS turnover and drives its accumulation in the DC, wherein the scaffolding function of TNKS induces AXIN puncta formation, rigidifies the DC, and impedes {beta}-catenin turnover. Chemically induced degradation of TNKS overcomes this limitation by stabilizing AXIN without puncta formation, providing a deeper suppression of the WNT/{beta}-catenin pathway activity and the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells harboring dysfunctional APC mutations.

We developed NCI1970-Meta, a harmonized dataset of 49,002 evaluable patients covering 30 drugs and 18 cancers, to provide the first large-scale benchmark linking in vitro potency, clinical pharmacokinetics, and Phase 2-3 outcomes data. Raw in vitro metrics values showed poor correlation with clinical response, systematically underestimating antimetabolites and overvaluing outliers such as gemcitabine. By contrast, normalizing potency to clinically achievable exposure (e.g. the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)) restored concordance with trial outcomes. Biomarker analyses, which compare patients treated with the same drug, were largely robust to this dichotomy: 234 curated biomarkers showed concordance across clinical and in vitro datasets. In addition, curated transporter knockout data validated a parallel flux model of additive resistance, explaining the limited success of multi-drug resistance inhibitors for drug-transporter enzymes. These findings establish exposure-normalized potency as a simple, actionable framework for translational oncology. We recommend screening to the unbound Cmax and normalizing potency metrics by exposure to improve the fidelity of functional assays, reduce bias in AI models, and refine biomarker discovery.

In this study, we conducted an in-depth transcriptomic and comparative genomic analysis to elucidate the molecular networks underlying these key traits. By integrating 117 RNA-Seq datasets and performing phylogenetic analyses across nine distinct C. sativa genomes, we identified 31 orthogroups of MADS-box transcription factors. Expression profiling of these genes revealed distinct sets of candidates associated with male and female flower identity, consistent with the established ABCDE model of floral development. Specifically, genes from the AP3, PI/GLO, and MIKCS clades showed preferential expression in male flowers, while genes from the AGL6, FLC-like, and Bsister clades were highly expressed in female flowers. Furthermore, our investigation into genes related to pollen development highlighted the significant role of sugar metabolism and transport in male fertility. Finally, our analysis of cannabinoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes confirmed their pronounced expression in trichomes and highlighted a key distinction: while the upstream polyketide, MEV, and MEP pathways and the terpenoid pathway showed conserved expression across chemotypes, the cannabinoid pathway exhibited chemotype-specific expression profiles.

In the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a blood feeding insect with specialized nutritional requirements, the relationship between feeding and sleep remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how blood derived dietary protein influences sleep regulation. Using postural analysis, videography, and arousal threshold assays, we establish that immobility bouts of greater than 10 minutes reliably define sleep in Ae. aegypti. Infrared activity monitoring revealed that blood-fed females exhibit a marked increase in sleep beginning immediately after feeding and persisting for several days, accompanied by reduced locomotor activity. Notably, this sleep elevation lasts well beyond the cessation of host-seeking behavior, suggesting distinct phases of opportunistic versus determined host pursuit. To determine the dietary basis of this effect, we tested mosquitoes fed a bovine serum albumin (BSA) based diet. BSA feeding alone was sufficient to mimic the sleep-promoting and hypoactive effects of blood, identifying dietary protein as the key nutritional regulator. Moreover, RNAi mediated knockdown of the leucokinin receptor (lkr), previously implicated in fluid regulation and feeding, enhanced sleep and reduced activity, implicating LK signaling in postprandial sleep modulation. Together, these findings demonstrate that blood-derived proteins drive sustained increases in sleep and reduced locomotion in Ae. aegypti. This work positions Ae. aegypti as a model for dissecting nutrient-specific regulation of sleep and highlights potential adaptive functions of protein-induced quiescence, such as energy conservation and predator avoidance.

We uncover a dramatic shift in nucleoid organization - from an ultra-compact, transcriptionally restricted state in attack-phase cells to a progressively decompacted, ori-centered conformation during intracellular replication. Notably, distinct transcriptional and chromosome folding states not only mark the canonical attack and growth phases, but also critical transitions such as prey invasion, replication onset, and predator division. Temporal gene expression profiles reflect the coordinated regulation of core cellular functions across the predatory cycle.

Here, we present a minimalistic consumer-resource model of a single microbial population with growth and death dynamics, consuming a continuously replenishing substrate. Our model reveals that decaying oscillations can occur if and only if the timescale of microbial adaptation to food supply changes exceeds the death timescale. This general rule allows us to easily examine additional physical phenomena. We find that microbial necromass recycling or complementary use of multiple food sources reduces the parameter range for oscillations and increases the decay rate of oscillations, stabilizing the dynamical system. Conversely, requiring multiple simultaneous food sources destabilizes the system. Essentially, facilitating growth reduces the likelihood of oscillations.

Rapid sequence evolution of immune genes, including NLRs, and variation in their gene content, may enable long-lived plants, which lack adaptive immune systems, to keep pace with the fast evolution of pathogens. To explore the patterns and processes shaping the evolution of NLR gene content in a genus of long-lived tree species, we unified the annotation of NLR genes across 11 accessions (or 15 haplotypes) from the genus Citrus and its relatives, including three new diploid genome assemblies. A majority of NLRs were arranged in genomic clusters composed of paralogous genes, typically from a single gene family. Even larger clusters, with 10 or more NLRs, were limited to genes derived from one or few gene families. These patterns suggested that genomic clustering of NLRs arose through local expansion of phylogenetically related NLRs, but the mechanistic processes driving these patterns are not clear. Local gene duplication can be mediated by multiple processes, including transposon-mediated gene capture and subsequent proliferation, and non-allelic repair of double stranded breaks, including unequal recombination. Examples of retrotransposon-mediated duplication of NLRs were identified, but these were not sufficient to explain massive regional expansions. Signatures of unequal recombination are challenging to identify. Focusing on recent lineage-specific sequence duplications, at least one case of unequal recombination was identified, supporting a role for unequal recombination in shaping genomic variation in these regions.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Intriguingly, while we found that the majority of arthropod CA homologs were classified in the Extracellular & Membrane-bound CA clade, the majority of chordate CA were within the Cytosolic CA clade. This result indicates divergence in CA expansion patterns between the two phyla. In addition, we found that CA12, a paralog that showed salinity-associated signatures of selection in the copepod Eurytemora affinis species complex in previous studies, also shows signatures of positive selection (based on dN/dS) in two of the three sister species of the copepod Eurytemora affinis species complex (E. carolleeae and E. gulfia), compared to the general arthropod CA background. Overall, our results indicate that the CA gene family shows signatures of selection at the macroevolutionary scale, across phyla, and between closely related sister species.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Current benchmarking approaches focus on feature-based assessments or intuitive biological and statistical tasks, which may not align with the models' training objectives. A recent study proposed a systematic benchmarking framework; however, its scope was limited to pre-trained (zero-shot) models. To address these limitations, we propose Single-Cell Foundation Model Evaluation (scFME)-a systematic method designed to benchmark fine-tuned foundation models for insilico perturbation (ISP). scFME ensures comprehensive and robust assessment by requiring sufficient separation between control and perturbed cells at the outset and by quantifying ISP accuracy against zero and random perturbation baselines. Furthermore, scFME enables exploration of model performance across distinct gene categories, facilitating biological interpretation and functional relevance. Using this framework, we evaluated several commonly used models (and some of their variants) and demonstrated that the methodology effectively characterizes their performance in ISP studies.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (esr1+) as well as from local esr1- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Supplementation with nicotinamide (NAM), a critical NAD+ precursor, has shown protection in experimental models of aging-related cardiac diseases, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure, especially heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. With the potential rise of NAM in treatment of various cardiometabolic diseases, its dose-dependent cardiac-specific adverse effects and underlying mechanisms warrant investigation. Methods The effects of NAM on aging-related arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction were assessed using ex vivo Langendorff mouse hearts and adult Drosophila heart preparations. Different doses of NAM (10-100 mM) were tested for their impact on the contractility of HL-1 cardiomyocytes, lifespan and cardiac function of Drosophila, as well as arrhythmia susceptibility of ex vivo mouse hearts. Acetylation of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+; ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) was measured by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. Results Acute perfusion with 10mM NAM had limited influence on aging-related AF susceptibility in ex vivo mouse hearts. Short-term dietary intervention with 10 mM NAM in late-life protected against aging-induced cardiac arrhythmia and contractile dysfunction exclusively in male Drosophila. In contrast, life-long exposure or NAM concentrations above 20 mM led to dose-dependent adverse cardiac effects, including impaired contractility in HL-1 cardiomyocyte and shortened lifespan in Drosophila, with increased arrhythmia observed in both models. In ex vivo mouse hearts, 100 mM NAM increased SERCA2a acetylation, suggesting inhibition of sirtuin1 and impaired calcium handling, which likely underlies the observed effects of high-dose NAM on arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction. Conclusions NAM exhibits a narrow therapeutic window in aging-related cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmia, with its efficacy highly dependent on dose, duration, and biological context. While a moderate dose in late-life may be protective, chronic or excessive intake of NAM can induce arrythmia and impair cardiac function, likely through disruption of the SERCA2a activity. These findings underscore the importance of cautious and context-specific application of NAM in clinical settings.

The goals of this study were to 1) determine whether middle cerebral artery (MCA) hemodynamics are altered in late gestation (LG) or two months postpartum in transgenic rats with preeclampsia compared to normal pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, and 2) evaluate the microRNA (miRNA) profiles of circulating pla-cental-derived extracellular vesicles (EVPD) using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway framework using NEST-Scoring [Node, Edge, System, Topology], a novel target gene profile network analysis. Our data showed elevated blood pressure in transgenic preeclampsia rats at both LG and two months postpartum (PP-2M) compared to normal pregnant SD rats in the setting of hypertension. The heart rate was also significantly higher in preeclampsia rats at LG. No differences were observed in left MCA (LMCA) velocities between strains or time points. However, LMCA re-sistance and pulsatility indexes were lower at PP-2M in transgenic preeclampsia rats compared to SD rats. Exposure to preeclampsia differentially altered the miRNA profiles of circulating EVPD in transgenic preeclampsia rats at both LG and PP-2M. The identified miRNA targets were associated with key vascu-lar and cellular regulatory pathways, suggesting a mechanistic link between placental dysfunction and postpartum vascular alterations in this preeclampsia model.

Downstream of the TCR, the Tec family tyrosine kinase ITK modulates the transcriptional response in T cells by differentially affecting the kinetics and magnitude of activation of these three transcription factors. How signaling through ITK regulates the duration and/or termination of TCR signaling has not been investigated. To address this, we utilized the Nr4a3-Tocky reporter mouse which provides information on the kinetics of TCR signaling over time courses from hours to days. OT-I CD8+ Nr4a3-Tocky T cells were stimulated with peptide ligands of varying affinities, and cells were assayed for a panel of surface and intracellular markers of activation and differentiation at multiple time points post-stimulation. As previously reported, at early time points ITK signaling enhanced the kinetics and magnitude of expression of these markers. At later time points the absence of ITK led to persistent expression of several proteins, indicating an important role for ITK in the termination of TCR-dependent transcriptional responses. Using a dual ITK/ RLK inhibitor (PRN694) at 24h post OVA peptide stimulation it was found that this function of ITK was required in the first 24 hours. These findings reveal a possible key negative regulatory mechanism that is programmed in the first day of activation but impacts CD8+ T cell gene expression patterns days later.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Achieving this requires reliable estimates of key epidemiological parameters, which are governed by aspects of host ecology and behaviour that are notoriously difficult to quantify in many wild species. Taking advantage of a long term study of the ecology of five Greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) maternity colonies in France (~2700 marked individuals), we sought to characterise lyssavirus infection dynamics in a wild bat reservoir. Although no lyssavirus was isolated from any of the 422 saliva samples tested, we report the first indirect evidence of European bat lyssavirus 2 circulation in this species. Interestingly, seropositivity appeared sporadic within colonies (0-100% annually) and synchronized across them, with highest seroprevalence in 2015-2017, but remaining low otherwise. Fitting Bayesian compartmental epidemiological models, we found that shifts in EBLV-2 prevalence were primarily driven by mating season introduction, age-dependant variation in transmission, and frequency-dependent transmission dynamics. Lyssavirus outbreaks involve few deaths overall but can still yield high annual mortality rates.

Large-bodied apex predators such as sharks are among the most affected, with overfishing causing dramatic species declines and ecosystem destabilization due to trophic downgrading. Key barriers to effective marine conservation and management include: Data deficiencies that hinder population benchmarks and impact assessments, limited surveillance, allowing illegal fisheries to disproportionately affect apex predators, and insufficient capacity in vulnerable nations to monitor and protect species within their waters. Our study addresses these challenges through a novel genomic framework that enables assessment of shark population diversity and health, while also improving fisheries traceability by detecting instances of illegal fishing across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. We present the Reefshark Genomescape, the first genome-wide reference database for Indo-Pacific reef sharks, an assessment of genetic diversity, structure, and connectivity of two key species across their Indo-Pacific range and geographic assignment of fished individuals using population-specific genetic signatures. We show that grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) populations exhibit high genetic diversity, strong population structure, and elevated Fst values, with previously unknown connectivity between the central and western Indian Ocean and clear isolation of populations in the Andaman Sea. In contrast, silvertip sharks (Carcharhinus albimarginatus) display high connectivity, but show genomic signals of declining population health, supporting a reassessment of their IUCN status. Using supervised machine learning with Monte Carlo cross-validation, we assigned geographic origins to fished grey reef sharks with 96% accuracy. These findings provide critical insights into population structure, connectivity, and health of two ecologically important reef shark species, while establishing a robust method for assigning geographic origin. We anticipate this framework will support regional conservation assessments and targeted management. Moreover, by enabling the identification of fishing hotspots and detection of IUU fishing, it lays the groundwork for a broader traceability system in marine ecosystems.

Structured coalescent models offer a phylogeographic framework by restricting lineage coalescence events to geographically proximate host populations. Although the Bayesian structured coalescent approximation (BASTA) provides a tractable approach, contemporary phylogeographic analyses involving dozens of geographic localities and hundreds to thousands of viral genomes substantially exceed the computational capacity of existing implementations. The BASTA likelihood scales cubically with deme count and quadratically with sequence count due to matrix exponentiation and pairwise coalescent probability calculations. Here, we introduce a comprehensive algorithmic restructuring of the structured coalescent likelihood that eliminates redundancies, optimizes memory access, and exposes parallelization opportunities. Our approach reorganizes computations along three dimensions: (i) independent calculation of deme-transition probability matrices across time intervals; (ii) simultaneous evaluation of partial likelihood vectors within temporal slices; and (iii) concurrent aggregation of coalescent probabilities. Algorithmic restructuring cuts average coalescent likelihood computation by 7 to 8 fold, and parallelization further boosts performance to 10 to 26 fold, enabling joint phylogeographic analyses of dengue virus across 10 South American countries and H5N1 avian influenza across 20 Eurasian regions to finish in a fraction of prior time. This computational efficiency also enables comparison between backward-in-time structured coalescent approximations and forward-in-time phylogeographic methods, revealing that the former provides appropriately conservative posterior estimates, particularly at intermediate phylogenetic depths. We integrate our implementation into the popular BEAST X and BEAGLE software packages, with an accompanying interface in BEAUti X to easily set up the analyses, providing researchers with an accessible and scalable tool for real-time phylogeographic surveillance of rapidly evolving pathogens.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

However, there are no structures of DnaK complexes with larger, mostly folded substrates, such as firefly luciferase (Fluc 61 kDa), which impedes the understanding of the mechanism through which DnaK refolds such large proteins. Here, we generated a model of a DnaK-firefly luciferase complex with Alphafold3, and examined its dynamics with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. In this complex, Fluc is immobilized under the DnaK alpha-helical lid against the NBD, not the SBD{beta}, contrary to the data reported in the literature for model peptides. The DnaK lid is positioned strategically over Fluc helix 405-411, which we recently determined to be the first (and likely the only) helix melted in Fluc at 42 {degrees}C. We simulated the interaction between DnaK and the helix in its native and misfolded state and found that during the lid translocation toward the SBD{beta}, only the melted helix follows the lid and is actively pulled out from Fluc, while the native helix is not dislocated. These observations suggest a new model for the DnaK chaperone mechanism, where the alpha helical lid forms hydrogen bonds to the protein segment to be structurally tested. Lid pulls out only highly deformable misfolded helices, allowing them to refold into their native structures, and does not pull out those that are correctly folded because they are not deformable.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we utilize all-atom molecular dynamics computer simulations to elucidate the binding mechanisms of an hIAPP aggregation inhibitor (YX-I-1) and an aggregation accelerator (YX-A-1) to disordered monomers of wild-type hIAPP and the naturally occurring pathogenic S20G hIAPP variant associated with early-onset T2D. We observe that the inhibitor exhibits substantially higher affinity for monomeric wild-type hIAPP than the accelerator, consistent with previously reported biophysical experiments. We dissect the interactions that stabilize binding of each molecule to wild-type and S20G hIAPP and characterize conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding. In all ligand-bound ensembles, distinct fragments of YX-I-1 and YX-A-1 are sequestered from solvent upon binding while other fragments remain solvent-exposed.

We combined ligand binding, thermostability measurements and atomistic molecular dynamics to dissect detergent versus ligand driven stabilization in a thermostabilized neurotensin receptor 1 (enNTS1). Circular dichroism and ligand binding assays revealed that apo enNTS1 becomes progressively more stable in decyl maltoside (DM), dodecyl maltoside (DDM), and lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG). Yet this gain in baseline stability was accompanied by a paradox: LMNG, the most stabilizing detergent, supported the weakest neurotensin agonist binding affinity. Thermodynamic analysis resolved this contradiction by partitioning stability into detergent-driven conformational rigidity (deltaGconf) and ligand-induced stabilization (deltaGligand). In DM, deltaGligand contributions were large, consistent with the receptors engineered background. In contrast, LMNG maximized deltaGconf, constraining conformational flexibility and reducing deltaGligand. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborated these results, showing that LMNG formed denser, less mobile detergent shells around the receptor, enhancing protein detergent interaction energies while limiting conformational flexibility. Redistribution of ligand contacts, particularly at neurotensin residue Y11, further underscored detergent-dependent modulation of the binding pocket. These results highlight a fundamental trade off: LMNG provides exceptional receptor stabilization, supporting structural studies, but may mask conformational states relevant to signaling. In contrast, less rigid detergents preserve ligand-induced transitions at the expense of stability.

Existing disease models often fail to fully capture the complex interplay between disease dynamics, host ecology, and socio-economic factors. We developed a comprehensive system dynamics (SD) model that integrates demographic, epidemiological, ecological, and socio-economic processes within a single model to more fully characterize the complex network of causal feedbacks throughout the system. The model was calibrated using a Bayesian approach that incorporates prior knowledge to generate biologically interpretable outcomes, even with sparse data. For estimating the joint posterior distribution of model parameters, we leveraged time series of deer abundance, harvest composition, genetic profiles, CWD surveillance, and hunter demographics and behavior. Model outputs reproduced key system behaviors, including observed CWD prevalence trends, deer population dynamics, and hunter license purchasing patterns. Model predictions were most sensitive to parameters governing initial deer population size and recruitment. While model predictions generally aligned with observed data, discrepancies in early CWD detection and overestimation of the reactivation of long-inactive hunters reflect data limitations and modeling challenges. Key results suggest that indirect transmission is necessary to explain observed prevalence, that transmission is moderately density-dependent, and that observed population-level genetic shifts driven by CWD may play a role in transmission and progression. The SD modelling approach enabled estimation of difficult-to-measure parameters and identified potential leverage points for management-such as prioritizing increasing participation in antlerless harvest of existing hunters over the recruitment of new hunters. This integrated modeling approach offers a flexible foundation for adaptive wildlife disease management and emphasizes the value of unifying biological and human dimension processes to better inform effective, evidence-based policy.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

We aimed to advance seaweed domestication by focusing on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), the fastest-growing haplodiplontic brown alga, which has significant ecological and commercial importance. We analyzed phenotypic data from two offshore experimental farms conducted in 2019 and 2020, which involved hundreds of outplanted genetically diverse sporophytes. We found that outplanting season and farm design had significant effects on giant kelp biomass. Broad-sense heritability estimates showed moderate (0.27-0.50) genetic contributions to two phenotypes, carbon content and total biomass. Genome-wide association studies for these phenotypes resulted in three statistically significant SNPs, located near or within genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and cytoskeletal functions. In addition, we applied genomic selection models that integrated sporophyte phenotypes and parental gametophyte genotypes. These models utilized reduced sets of GWAS-ranked SNPs obtained by a procedure based on linkage disequilibrium estimations. Model testing yielded cross-validation accuracy values of up to 0.84 and predictive accuracy values of up to 0.40, demonstrating the potential of marker-assisted breeding for phenotype improvement.

Materials and Methods: Six commonly used parabens (ethyl-, propyl-, methyl-, heptyl-, butyl-, and benzylparaben) were selected for toxicity prediction via ProTox 3.0 and ADMETlab2.0. Their potential targets were retrieved from Swiss Target Prediction, ChEMBL, and the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA). HNSCC-related targets were collected from GeneCards, OMIM, and CTD, while differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using TCGA-HNSC data. Functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, hub gene identification, molecular docking, and immune infiltration analyses were performed using DAVID, STRING, Cytoscape, CB-DOCK2, and TIMER2.0. Results: We identified 80 common targets through which parabens may exert toxic effects in HNSCC. Among these, 12 hub genes (CCNB1, CDK1, CCNA2, CDK2, CDK4, TYMS, AURKA, CCNA1, CHEK1, CCNB2, PLK1, CDC25A) were significantly overexpressed in HNSCC tissues and were primarily enriched in cell cycle regulation, p53 signaling, and viral carcinogenesis pathways. CCNA1 was further validated as an independent prognostic factor associated with poor survival. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities between parabens and hub proteins. Immune infiltration analysis indicated a negative correlation between CCNA1 expression and CD8+ T cell and B cell infiltration. Conclusions: Parabens may promote HNSCC progression by disrupting cell cycle regulation and immune responses via direct interactions with key hub genes. These findings provide a novel mechanistic basis for the carcinogenic potential of parabens in HNSCC and underscore the need for further experimental and epidemiological validation.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

In this study, we modeled extreme Ag heterogeneity (>20%) to define how Fas/FasL-dependent bystander killing contributes to tumor clearance. Across patient cohorts, Fas expression predicted survival after CD19 CAR-T therapy, particularly in CD19-low disease. In both murine and human systems, Fas-dependent bystander killing required Ag stimulation and cell contact, operated within a defined therapeutic window, and could eradicate large fractions of Ag- tumors in vivo. Pharmacologic potentiation with inhibitor of apoptosis protein antagonists or genetic stabilization of CAR-T membrane-bound FasL enhanced bystander killing but simultaneously induced CD4 T cell fratricide, which was rescued by CAR-T Fas knockout. Importantly, Fas sensitization also enabled bispecific antibody-redirected T cells to mediate bystander killing in resistant tumors. Finally, targeting tumor-associated macrophages triggered Fas-dependent clearance of neighboring tumor cells. These findings establish Fas-mediated bystander killing as a generalizable and therapeutically actionable axis to prevent Ag escape and broaden the scope of targeted T cell therapies.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

By causing cancer cells to die and relieve antigens, these viruses can stimulate robust, systemic immune responses that may eliminate disseminated disease and prevent recurrence. Unfortunately, clinical trials using oncolytic viruses have not induced clearance of metastasis or protection from recurrence. Likewise, the combination of the only FDA-approved oncolytic virus-Talimogene laherparapvec-with immune checkpoint blockade did not improve progression-free or overall survival. Because of these disappointing clinical trials, we sought to measure the ability of oncolytic viruses to induce cancer antigen presentation and the elicitation of cancer antigen-specific immune responses. Our data revealed that despite improved antigen presentation by dendritic cells, priming of cancer antigen-specific T cells was limited. However, viral antigen-specific T cells did develop and were in a phenotypic state to induce an effective response against virally infected cells. These preclinical results were mirrored in human peripheral blood samples. Overall, these data show that oncolytic virus treatment induces a response against the virus itself, but not cancer antigen, explaining the lack of response in metastatic disease.

Post-fire increases in NH4+ and soil physicochemical changes may promote further N loss by stimulating microbially-driven emissions of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N2O)--trace gases that alter air quality and climate. We hypothesized that soil NO and N2O emissions would increase with the flush of post-fire N availability and would be highest in soils that burned at medium severity due to the combination of high soil N availability and persistence of microbial activity. To test this, we established nine plots (6 burned; 3 unburned) and sampled soils seasonally over three years after wildfire in a chaparral shrubland in Southern California, USA. Wildfire significantly increased soil extractable NH4+ by an average of 10 g NH4+-N g soil-1, soil extractable NO3- by 8 g NO3--N, and soil pH by 0.5 units. Post-fire soil NO emissions significantly increased by an average 74 ng NO-N g-1 (cumulative 40-h incubations) over three years, with the highest emissions measured in year one from plots that burned at medium and high severities. No significant effects of burning were detectable for N2O emissions over three years (average {+/-} standard error; 224 {+/-} 107 ng N2O-N g-1 soil in burned plots and 30 {+/-} 17 ng N2O-N g-1 soil in unburned plots); however, we observed high fluxes only from soils that burned at medium and high severities (N2O > 3500 ng N2O-N g-1 soil). Isotopic characterization of N2O from high-emitting soils indicated contributions from diverse sources and increased N2O reduction to N2. Overall, the occurrence of high N2O fluxes and accelerated NO emissions post fire indicate wildfires interact with soil N cycling to promote burn-severity-sensitive gaseous N losses long after wildfires are extinguished.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the dual obligate symbiosis of the aphid Lachnus tropicalis, where an ancestral Serratia lineage was replaced by a newly acquired another Serratia lineage while the primary symbiont Buchnera remained. Our metagenomic sequencing yielded complete genomes of Buchnera (0.42 Mb) and Serratia (2.8 Mb), revealing developing metabolic complementarity. Although the Serratia genome retained abundant gene sets for amino acid synthesis, it also contained pseudogenes in leucine and methionine pathways, which would be compensated for by Buchnera or the host. Comparison with L. roboris, which harbors the ancestral Serratia lineage, showed that the newly acquired Serratia in L. tropicalis exhibits identical tissue localization and vertical transmission pattern, suggesting the smooth succession of the prior's microniche. Notably, Buchnera in L. tropicalis exhibited a slightly more degenerated genome than its counterpart in L. roboris, indicating that symbiont replacement can accelerate gene loss even in ancient symbionts.

While cortical pulling forces mediated by dynein motor proteins are well-established drivers of spindle dynamics, the contribution of microtubule polymerization-based pushing forces remains unclear. We developed a generalizable computational biophysical model that integrates both pulling and pushing mechanisms to investigate spindle behavior across diverse cell types and geometries. This model successfully recapitulates experimental observations in three well-studied models: Drosophila follicular epithelial cells, Drosophila neuroblasts, and the early C. elegans embryo. Systematic analysis reveals that while pulling forces are the primary drivers of directed spindle orientation, pushing forces play crucial supporting roles by preventing spindle stalling and promoting alignment dynamics, particularly at high initial misalignment angles. We further applied our model to irregularly shaped zebrafish endothelial cells, which present unique challenges due to their non-spherical morphology and dynamic shape changes during mitosis. Our results demonstrate that asymmetric cortical force generator distributions, potentially localized at cell-cell junctions, can account for the observed off-center spindle positioning in these cells.

This Gram-negative bacterium establishes pathogenicity through formation of multicellular communities, known as biofilms, that result in significant resistance to antibiotics and host immune systems. In Pa, the motile-to-biofilm transition is regulated through an interconnected signaling network known as the Gac Multikinase Network (Gac-MKN). This network comprises two regulatory branches: the HptB signaling network and GacS/A signaling network. In the Gac-MKN, several histidine kinases converge to regulate the activity of the post-transcriptional regulator protein, RsmA. Although previous studies have assessed the role of individual kinases in this network, the role of each Gac-MKN kinase in regulating RsmA activity has not been quantitatively characterized and compared in side-by-side experiments in the same reference strain, which is presented here. In this study, we show that kinases NahK and RetS are the predominant regulators of the Gac-MKN. Through controlled testing of RsmA-dependent phenotypes, we demonstrate loss of nahK or retS leads to complete inactivation of RsmA, triggering biofilm formation. Our results support previous findings that RetS regulates RsmA through the GacS/A network but present the new finding that NahK is the central kinase involved in HptB phosphorylation; previous studies have attributed HptB phosphorylation to PA1611 and SagS. Our findings demonstrate that NahK signaling controls RsmA activity to rapidly transition between the motile and biofilm states.

Design: Experimental preclinical animal study conducted between 2023 and 2025. Setting: Single-center laboratory-based animal research facility affiliated with an academic medical center. Participants: Nineteen New Zealand White rabbits underwent surgically induced perforated appendicitis with peritonitis via appendiceal ligation and electrocautery perforation. Interventions: Rabbits received laparoscopic MB-PDT (n=9) or control conditions (methylene blue only, no light; n=10) 24 - 40 hours after appendiceal perforation. MB-PDT involved peritoneal lavage with 300 g/mL methylene blue, followed by 665 nm laser illumination to 25 J/cm2. Peritoneal aspirates were collected before and 24h after intervention. Bacterial burden was quantified, and isolated bacteria were submitted to in vitro PDT. Tissue samples from intraperitoneal organs were collected 24 hours post-intervention. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included feasibility of PDT delivery, safety (histologic evidence of off-target injury), and preliminary in vivo efficacy (change in bacterial burden pre- vs. post-intervention). Secondary outcomes included clinical parameter changes and in vitro MB-PDT efficacy. Results: Of the 14 rabbits that developed peritonitis, 10 (age 5-6 months, weight 3.1-3.8 kg) completed follow-up. Laparoscopic MB-PDT delivery was feasible and caused no off-target histologic injury. Bacterial burden increased in MB-PDT animals relative to controls, though not significantly (p=0.18).

Once considered byproducts of in vitro viral replication, cbDVGs have since been detected in clinical specimens and implicated in affecting infection outcomes. The molecular mechanism of cbDVG generation remains unclear, thereby hindering our ability to manipulate cbDVG production during infection for therapeutic gain. Previous work showed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cbDVG re-initiation sites cluster in trailer-end hotspots R1, R2, and R3, and that a poly-U mutation in R1 selectively reduced cbDVG formation at the mutated region. Here, we reported that a 10U mutation in R2 drastically reduced cbDVGs in this region in both minigenome and recombinant virus systems. Furthermore, during high-MOI passaging of the R2-10U virus, we observed delayed detection of cbDVGs with re-initiation sites in R1-R3 (trailer cbDVGs) compared to WT, while no differences in virus titers were observed. Interestingly, we observed the rapid emergence and accumulation of a viral variant bearing a 2-ribonucleotide deletion (R2-8U) within the R2-10U mutation sequence as early as P0. Compared to R2-10U, the R2-8U virus was stable, displayed faster generation and accumulation of trailer cbDVGs, restored cbDVGs with R2 re-initiation sites, and exhibited enhanced genomic replication. Overall, our data identify a sequence in the RSV trailer whose mutation critically modulates both viral replication and the generation/propagation of trailer cbDVGs. Our data also suggest that cbDVG generation, particularly near the trailer, may be an evolutionary tradeoff for more rapid virus genomic replication.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

The predicted structures are used for a variety of downstream tasks such as pose-scoring functions or as a starting point for binding free energy estimation. The accuracy of downstream models depends on how well predicted poses match experimentally-validated poses. Although the ideal input to these downstream tasks would be experimental structures, the time and cost required to collect new experimental structures for synthesized compounds makes obtaining this structure for every input intractable. Thus, leveraging available structural data is required to efficiently extrapolate new designs. Using data from the open science COVID Moonshot project---where nearly every compound synthesized was crystallographically screened---we assess several popular strategies for generating docked poses in a structure-enabled discovery program using both retrospective and prospective analyses. We explore the tradeoff between the cost of obtaining crystal structures and the utility for accurately predicting poses of newly designed molecules. We find that a simple strategy using molecular similarity to identify relevant structures for template-guided docking is successful in predicting poses for the SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease. Further efficiency analysis suggests template-based docking of a scaffold series is a robust strategy even when the quantity of available structural data is limited. The resulting open source pipeline and curated datasets should prove useful for automated modeling of bound poses for downstream scoring, machine learning, and free energy calculation tasks for structure-based drug discovery programs.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Metabolic processes are essential for regulating and maintaining developmental transitions, from stem cell quiescence through differentiation. However, the distinct metabolite-driven mechanisms that are critical for development remain poorly characterized due to inherent challenges in measuring their production, localization, and function in situ. We employed desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) to map metabolites in the developing maize root, which has a well-characterized longitudinal gradient that encompasses developmental transitions from quiescence through proliferation and maturation. DESI-MSI enables in situ analysis of the chemical composition of tissue sections with high spatial resolution (~50-100 {micro}m). To identify metabolites with specific developmental enrichment patterns, we developed a computational approach called Developmental Imaging Mass Spectrometry Pipeline for Linear Evaluation (DIMPLE). DIMPLE processes mass signatures along linear gradients, generating clusters of metabolites with specific developmental enrichment patterns in the maize root. We employed this method to compare developmental enrichment of metabolites in a salt-resilient maize variety, Oaxacan Green, and a salt-susceptible variety, B73. DIMPLE identifies specific differences in the mass signatures and the overall enrichment patterns between these varieties. DIMPLE also revealed a metabolite, D-erythrose, that had different localization patterns in these varieties. We found that in salt-sensitive maize varieties, treatment with D-erythrose improves stress tolerance by increasing primary root length. Overall, DIMPLE enables comprehensive and rapid analysis of metabolite patterns along a linear gradient, revealing new biology in plant growth and stress response.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Photothrombosis involves the delivery of an intravascular photosensitizer (Rose Bengal) followed by its photoactivation, resulting in vessel occlusion and ischemia. Using a combination of complementary optical and non-optical techniques, we characterized the physiological changes in mice undergoing photothrombosis. We report that Rose Bengal acts as a rapid vasoconstrictor, inducing hypoemia both in the brain and periphery even in the absence of its photoactivation. Conversely, we find that light, when used at photothrombosis-appropriate intensities and durations, induces large amounts of tissue heating and hyperemia even in the distal non-illuminated hemisphere. Furthermore, we show that use of the optimal photothrombotic wavelength based on the Rose Bengal absorption spectrum (yellow-561nm) produces a more consistent and pronounced drop in blood flow, and a shorter latency to the initial spreading depolarization (SD), ultimately resulting in a larger stroke. Similarly, when yellow light is used to induce a stroke in ChR2-expressing mice, the electrophysiological and hemodynamic confounds from green light cross activation of ChR2 are eliminated. Finally, we observe across cohorts that male mice have larger strokes than females. Altogether, we extensively describe important caveats and confounds concerning photothrombosis and provide a detailed characterization of its early ischemic events.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

The current problems with conventional antibacterial agents have led to the choice of honey and other natural products by the populace in treatment of bacterial infections. The present study therefore evaluates the Antibacterial activity of honey on wound isolates from patients attending Benue state university, Makurdi and compared same with ampiclox. Different concentrations (50, 75 and 100%) honey were studied using agar disc diffusion on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis and data was subjected to chi-square analysis. All bacteria were susceptible to honey at 100% concentration. Proteus mirabilis had the highest Z.I (25mm), S. aureus (23mm), E. coli (22mm) and Klebsiella (10mm). Inhibition zone of neat honey and ampliclox on test bacteria were E. coli (22, 20mm), S. aureus (23, 25mm), Proteus mirabilis (25, 23mm) and Klebsiella (10, 11mm) respectively. While antibacterial activity at different dilutions was significant, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of honey was determined using broth dilution method and data obtained presented Proteus mirabilis as most susceptible organism and Klebsiella the least. Honey also had an acidic pH of 4.15 and ash content of 0.029g. The neat concentration (100%) had potency similar but not superior to that of ampiclox.

W.", "abstract": "Background: Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by systematic granuloma formation, predominantly in the lungs. While its etiology remains under investigation, one leading hypothesis posits that prolonged exposure to microbial antigens may trigger chronic and dysregulated inflammation. Prior studies have examined the lung microbiota of sarcoidosis patients, but the role of the gut microbiota along the gut-immune axis remains largely unexplored. We elucidate the community composition and function of the gut microbiome in sarcoidosis. Methods: Subjects diagnosed with sarcoidosis (n=37) were recruited and matched with healthy control subjects (n=37). Stool samples were collected from sarcoidosis patients for metagenomic sequencing, followed by taxonomic classification and functional annotation as KEGG Orthology (KO) pathways. Control gut microbiome data from a previously published study was processed using the same bioinformatics pipeline as the sarcoidosis cohort. Differential analysis between sarcoidosis and control cohorts was performed using both standard and compositional approaches. Results: Overall, sarcoidosis microbiomes exhibited similar alpha diversity but significantly different beta diversity from control microbiomes (p<0.05). At the phylum level, the proportion of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes expanded whereas Bacteroides and Verrucomicrobia proportionally shrunk in sarcoidosis gut microbiomes compared to healthy control ones. At the species level, 1,495 species were significantly more abundant and 279 less abundant in sarcoidosis compared to controls (FDR<0.05). Of these, 13 species demonstrated greater intergroup than intragroup variation (effect size>1), including microbes previously detected in the lungs and granulomas of sarcoidosis. Functional profiling revealed 409 KO pathways that were significantly underrepresented in sarcoidosis compared to control (FDR<0.05), of which 79 met an effect size > 1. These include pathways in amino acid and energy metabolism as well as HIF-1 signaling. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential role of gut microbiome composition and function in inflammatory processes that are associated with granuloma formation in sarcoidosis.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Here we identify a previously unrecognized PFAS biodefluorination mechanism mediated by mycothiol (MSH), a ubiquitous thiol antioxidant produced by Actinomycetota. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry and non-target analysis, MSH-mediated conjugation is unraveled as a dominant biotransformation pathway for two representative fluorotelomer carboxylic acids (6:2 and 5:3 FTCAs) in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 and other MSH-producing species. Conjugation proceeds through nucleophilic substitution and {beta}-elimination in 6:2 FTCA, releasing two fluoride ions, and through Michael addition in the unsaturated analogue of 5:3 FTCA. These reactions are catalyzed by the conserved enzyme mycothiol S-transferase (MST), which contains a conserved His47-Asp150-His154 tripod motif essential to activate MSH for nucleophilic attack. Subsequent hydrolysis by mycothiol S-conjugate amidase (Mca) yields mercapturic acid derivatives, with more than 20 novel downstream thiol metabolites detected. Time-series experiments confirmed that MSH conjugation accounted for up to half of FTCA removal and fluoride release, resolving major fluorine mass balance gaps. The conjugation process also interlinks with chain-shortening \"one-carbon removal\" routes, forming a cascading metabolic network. Importantly, conjugated metabolites were consistently detected in activated sludge microbiomes, and metagenomic surveys revealed more than 100,000 MST homologs worldwide. Collectively, these findings establish MSH-mediated conjugation as a widespread and mechanistically distinct route of PFAS biodefluorination, highlighting new opportunities for microbial PFAS removal in natural and engineered systems.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

VVC is hormonally driven and rare in young girls and postmenopausal women. A central challenge lies in dissecting the complex interplay between microbial communities, hormonal factors, and host epithelial responses. While C. albicans is part of the normal vaginal microbiota at low abundance, its morphogenic switch to the hyphal form is closely linked with pathogenicity. Concomitantly, the dominance of specific Lactobacillus species is known to modulate vaginal health, but their precise role in shaping host-pathogen interactions during VVC is unresolved. We hypothesised that clinical isolate pairs of C. albicans and Lactobacillus spp. may differ in their ability to drive host epithelial damage, and that hormonal signals such as estrogen may exacerbate these interactions. To test this, we developed an in vitro VVC model using human vaginal epithelial cell (VEC) monolayers co-cultured with clinical isolate pairs. Using LDH release as a marker of cytotoxicity, extracellular pH monitoring, and immunoassays of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, we interrogated host responses across microbial conditions in the presence or absence of estrogen. Our findings demonstrate that two clinical isolate pairs exhibit divergent behaviours. Pair C (C. albicans 203 and L. gasseri 167) suppressed epithelial cytotoxicity and maintained acidic pH, while Pair D (C. albicans 205 and L. jensenii 172) enhanced host damage and did not acidify the environment. Morphological differences in C. albicans isolates correlated with MAPK activation profiles, supporting a phenotype-specific host response. These results reveal that strain-level interactions within the vaginal microbiota significantly modulate host-pathogen dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Yet, the mechanistic underpinnings of elemental stoichiometry are poorly quantified in many cases. We combined targeted and untargeted metaproteomics, Bayesian statistical modelling, and geochemical measurements to quantify the contribution of specific proteins to metal stoichiometry in natural populations of Southern Ocean diatoms. Our analyses indicate that a substantial amount of non-photosynthetic manganese (Mn) in diatoms in an Antarctic polynya can be attributed to superoxide dismutases (~0.7 mol Mn : mol Carbon; ~20% of the total cellular Mn quota). We then used cultures and proteomic profiling of the key polar diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus to identify environmental controls on superoxide dismutases, and discovered that iron concentration has little influence on the abundance of two Mn superoxide dismutases, while Mn limitation induces the depletion of these Mn superoxide dismutases and an accompanying increase of nickel superoxide dismutase. Overall, we combined metaproteomic approaches to quantify proteomic composition and connected these measurements to metal-to-carbon ratios and their responses to metal availability.

But it is unknown how often these mutations confer resistance to other extreme environments to which the viruses have not been previously exposed. Here, we focus on how prior adaptation to thermal stress affects viral survival during exposure to acidic, basic, and UV conditions. We exposed four genotypes (3 single mutants and an unmutated ancestor) of the bacteriophage {varphi}6 with varying thermostability (low, high, or ancestral) to acid (pH 4) for 2 minutes, to base (pH 11) for 16 hours, or to UV radiation for 1 minute.

Unexpectedly, the least thermostable genotype demonstrated the highest survival in acidic, basic, and UV conditions, while the most thermostable genotype tended to show the lower survival in these environments. These results suggest that mutations that increase phage thermostability may not always increase pH or UV stability. Rather, molecular mechanisms of stability may depend on the environment. Investigating the survival of {varphi}6 in other adverse environments could provide further information on molecular mechanisms of stability and viral survival strategies.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

The conventional tempeh fungus, Rhizopus microsporus var. oligosporus, was used as control. Different substrate-fungus combinations varied in impact on flavour and protein quality. SSFF improved the protein quality and umami taste of brown rice and mainly improved in umami taste of lupin, while fermentation of BSG with basidiomycetes even decreased protein quality. Basidiomycetous SSFF products exhibited higher umami potential, with equivalent umami concentrations (EUC) reaching 159 g MSG-eq/100 g DW, surpassing the values found for R. microsporus-fermented products. In terms of substrates, the protein content increased most in brown rice fermentations, while the EUC and protein quality increased most in lupin. Protein quality and content increased more in basidiomycetes, indicated by the up to 35.1% increase in the protein digestibility corrected amino acid score of the limiting amino acid lysine and a 36.4% rise in utilizable amino acids.

Yet, the eco-evolutionary relationships among these congeneric species remain poorly understood - specifically, how they diversify, sort into their elevational niches, and the extent to which species boundaries are maintained through time. In this study, we use the genus Prunus (cherries) as a model to investigate these processes by (1) reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships and timing of divergence among sympatric species and (2) assessing inter-specific gene flow and its correspondence to evolutionary and ecological distance. Extensive population-level sampling was conducted for species which co-occur along an elevational gradient in Manu National Park, Peru. Additional samples were included for species which co-occur across a gradient in Madidi National Park, Bolivia. Phylogenetic relationships reconstructed a pattern of upslope adaptive diversification concurrent with Andean orogeny during the Miocene. However, despite these ancient diversification events, gene flow analyses found species are not reproductively isolated, and gene flow has occurred through time. Additionally, gene flow is widespread and does not appear to be constrained by evolutionary or ecological distance. Together, these findings provide insight into the processes that have shaped tree diversity in the tropical Andes and suggest that during adaptive radiations, observable ecological, and morphological differences may emerge long before complete phylogenomic isolation, even amid ongoing gene flow.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

In contrast, lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)-based diagnostics are popular point-of-care tests due to their simplicity and user-friendly format but lack sensitivity for detecting the low concentrations of proteins that are present early in infections and among asymptomatic individuals. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel biosensor platform utilizing antibody-initiated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (ai-LAMP) with an LFIA readout for protein detection. This platform integrates protein-specific antibody-antigen binding with the robust signal amplification of LAMP. By conjugating pairs of antibodies to overlapping DNA strands, the presence of a target protein brings the DNA strands into proximity, completing a DNA target to initiate the LAMP reaction without any additional ligation step. This approach facilitates the rapid detection of low concentration proteins with a clear visual readout and can be performed in 3 steps from sample to answer. Using ai-LAMP we detected HIV-1 p24 on commercially available LFIAs at a limit of detection (LOD) of 20 fM (0.53 pg/mL), demonstrating 40x improvement over existing HIV p24 LFIAs.

When the depolarizing effects are strong enough, the cells undergo depolarization blockade, known as spreading depression. Excess extracellular K+ increases energy demand from the Na+-K+ pump, producing a pathological confluence of increased demand with reduced delivery of energy. The resulting changes have profound effects at subcellular, cellular, and network scales of brain function. We hypothesized that consequences of ischemic or SD homeostatic failure would differ on the subcellular scale, with differences between disjunct dendritic regions of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron. To evaluate the interplay between morphology and ion concentrations, we used a mechanistic simulation incorporating neuronal morphology, pumps, exchangers, voltage-, and Ca2+-sensitive ion channels.

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of 'partial remapping'. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus' ability to support high-capacity memory storage.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

M.; Badr, S.; Duan, K.", "abstract": "The type six secretion system (T6SS) is a macromolecular weapon used by many Gram-negative bacteria. The T6SS functions as a needle injection system that delivers effector proteins directly into neighboring bacterial cells, thereby affecting their gene expression and physiological processes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses three distinct T6SSs, designated as H1-, H2-, and H3-T6SS. Although extensive studies have been carried out on these T6SS systems in recent years, the regulatory mechanisms of T6SS remain incomplete. Here, we report the identification of norCBD as an operon that modulates the transcriptional activity of H2-T6SS. Both transposon insertion at norCBD and the deletion of the norCBD genes significantly reduced the CTX-H2-T6SS reporter activity. The norCBD operon encodes nitric oxide reductase (NorCBD), which reduces nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N2O), a crucial step in reducing the toxic levels of intracellular NO and facilitating anaerobic respiration. As the transcriptional regulatory Dnr activates H2-type VI secretion system (H2-T6SS) in response to NO, experiments were carried out to examine whether norCBD deletion caused intracellular NO accumulation, which in turn disrupted Dnr-dependent regulation of H2-T6SS and virulence factors. The NO levels and Dnr-regulated gene expression were measured, and several virulence-related phenotypes were examined. The effects of NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and NO scavenger carboxy-phenyl-tetramethylimidazolineoxyl (CPTIO) were also tested. The data obtained indicate that deletion of norCBD led to intracellular NO accumulation, reduced H2-T6SS expression, and affected motility, pyocyanin production, and biofilm formation. Complementation of norCBD on a plasmid in the deletion mutant was able to restore H2-T6SS expression and the examined phenotypes to the wild-type levels. Treatment with CPTIO also restored H2-T6SS expression in the PAO1({Delta}norCBD). These results indicate that NorCBD plays a critical role in maintaining NO homeostasis that is necessary for effective Dnr-mediated gene regulation and multiple virulence-related traits, highlighting the importance of redox balance in coordinating respiration and pathogenesis in P. aeruginosa.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

In response to exposure to naphthenic acids, Pseudomonas sp. OST1909 induces the expression of operons regulated by TetR and MarR-type transcriptional repressors. This class of repressor releases from promoters after binding small molecules, leading to a de-repression of the target operons. We propose that these regulators sense fatty and naphthenic acids and control the expression of genes required to cope with their exposure. Plasmid-encoded transcriptional lux reporters to the atu degradation and mar antimicrobial resistance promoters were constructed that also included the corresponding repressor protein, controlled by various strength constitutive promoters. We provide evidence that the atuAR and marR promoters are directly repressed by AtuR and MarR, respectively. His-tagged MarR and AtuR proteins bound to their promoters containing palindromic binding sites in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Fatty and naphthenic acid compounds and mixtures prevented promoter DNA binding to the repressor proteins in EMSA assays, which suggested direct analyte binding to the protein. The marR-H biosensor construct was functional when introduced into E. coli, confirming the role of NA sensing and transcriptional repressor proteins. This study provides mechanistic insight into the use of NA-inducible promoters as bacterial biosensors for NA detection and identifies novel ligands for the MarR and TetR types of repressor proteins.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

J.; Abdalla, B. J.; Abramovitch, R. B.", "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) arrests its growth at acidic pH, when grown on specific single carbon sources, including propionate. To understand the basis of the propionate-driven growth arrest at acidic pH, we conducted a genetic selection for mutants enabling growth on propionate at pH 5.7. All the selected mutants had insertions in the two-component regulatory genes phoR or phoP. We hypothesized that growth arrest at acidic pH is caused by PhoPR diverting carbon from central carbon metabolism towards lipid anabolism and that when PhoPR is inactivated, growth is promoted through metabolizing propionate by the methyl citrate cycle (MCC) into pyruvate, a permissive carbon source for growth at acidic pH. Using chemical inhibition and mutants of the MCC pathway, we demonstrate that the enhanced growth is dependent on the MCC. Furthermore, stimulating lipid synthesis via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway by adding Vitamin B12 restricts growth in the {Delta}phoPR mutant and, conversely, restricting lipid anabolism by inhibiting the triacylglycerol (TAG) synthase Tgs1 enhances growth of the{Delta} phoPR mutant. Notably, CoA pools increased in the{Delta} phoPR mutant grown on propionate, directly supporting our model. Given the role of CoA metabolism in pyrazinamide sensitivity, Mtb sensitivity to pyrazinamide was examined on propionate at acidic pH. Surprisingly, pyrazinamide treatment of WT Mtb suppresses growth arrest on propionate at acidic pH. In contrast, the phoPR mutant has enhanced sensitivity to pyrazinamide. Together, these findings support that propionate-driven growth arrest at acidic pH is caused by metabolic remodeling that is regulated by PhoPR and is associated with pyrazinamide sensitivity.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

In the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles coluzzii, yellow is strongly expressed during juvenile stages and in adult ovaries, mirroring pigmentation patterns that likely enhance desiccation resistance, camouflage, and reproductive fitness. To dissect its function, we generated a complete knockout allele yellow(-)KI by replacing the first exon with an EGFP reporter, and introgressed it into multiple genetic backgrounds. Loss of yellow abolished black cuticle pigmentation and delayed larval development but left adult lifespan unaffected. Developmental delay likely impaired mating success in competition with wild-type mosquitoes, hastening the decline of the X-linked yellow(-)KI allele. Notably, yellow(-)KI females showed a consistent twofold increase in susceptibility to the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, independent of the complement factor TEP1 and melanization, whereas infection with P. falciparum was unchanged. Antibiotic treatment reversed the heightened P. berghei susceptibility, implicating altered gut microbiota as a mediator.

Flavonoids are widely recognized for their antimicrobial and signaling functions, yet their role in mediating metabolite-microbiome-pathogen interactions in pepper (Capsicum frutescens) remains poorly understood. Results Through integrated microbiome, transcriptome, and metabolome analyses, we compared resistant (CA53) and susceptible (CA476) pepper cultivars under challenge by Phytophthora capsici. Resistant plants maintained relatively stable transcriptional and metabolic profiles, whereas susceptible plants exhibited a pronounced suppression of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, with a marked decline in apigenin levels. Exogenous application of apigenin significantly enhanced pepper resistance by disrupting sporangial cell membrane integrity and thereby inhibiting zoospore release. In addition, apigenin functioned as a central hub metabolite, selectively enriching disease-suppressive rhizosphere microbes and reinforcing host protection. Conclusion Our findings uncover a dual role of apigenin in pepper resistance: directly inhibiting pathogen propagation and indirectly reinforcing the recruitment of protective microbiota.

Here we show that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1 sustains germline repression independently of canonical heterochromatin marks. Inducible HRDE-1 depletion combined with germline nuclear sorting, CUT&Tag, and nascent transcription analysis revealed endogenous genes that become transcriptionally activated in the absence of HRDE-1 despite retention of H3K9me3 and H3K23me3. HRDE-1 further promotes polyUG-dependent amplification of antisense 22G-RNAs in perinuclear condensates, redefining nuclear Argonautes as active drivers of small RNA biogenesis rather than passive acceptors. Loss of HRDE-1 triggers the progressive erosion of 22G-RNAs and prevents the rapid re-establishment of silencing, underscoring the necessity of nuclear-cytoplasmic coupling for epigenetic memory. Our findings challenge the long-standing assumption that heterochromatin is required for transcriptional repression and redefine the mechanism by which nuclear Argonautes enforce epigenetic inheritance.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

This interaction, naturally triggered by the NAD+ metabolite ADP-ribose (ADPR), resembles substrate binding and block SIRT2's active site. Interestingly, SerRS acetylation is not required for this interaction. SIRT2 binding sterically and allosterically impedes tRNA binding to SerRS, lowering charged tRNASer level and protein synthesis activity. Key interaction residues in both proteins emerged simultaneously in vertebrates, suggesting co-evolution for cross-regulation.

Many tools have recently been developed to date the nodes of a standard phylogeny, but all make underlying assumptions that may not be realistic for a given dataset, making the results potentially unreliable. Model comparison is sometimes used to remedy this issue, whereby inference under several models is compared to establish which result can be trusted. Although such comparison is clearly useful to assess the relative merits of several inference attempts, here instead we focus on the problem of evaluating how good an inference is in absolute terms, without comparison. We consider several approaches for diagnosing potential issues in a reconstructed dated phylogeny, including outlier detection, posterior predictive checking and residual analysis. These methods are well-established diagnostics tools in other areas of statistics, but here we show how they can be applied to the specific inference of dated phylogenies. We illustrate their use on many simulated datasets, with inference being performed either from the correct model to quantify the specificity or from an incorrect model to quantify the sensitivity of the diagnostics methods. We also applied the methods to three real-life datasets to showcase the range of issues that they can detect. We advocate the use of these diagnostics tools for all microbial population genetic studies that involve the reconstruction of a dated phylogeny.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

Three distinct filamentous assemblies were resolved by cryo-EM and are mediated by the oligomerization loop (residues 516-525): (i) ligand-free trans-dimers that form trans-basal filaments with basal stability and activity, (ii) adenosylornithine-bound cis-dimers that assemble into stabilized cis-basal filaments and (iii) S-adenosylmethionine-bound allo-dimers, which, together with cis-dimers, form highly stable, allo-activated stacked filaments.

This can be especially challenging when targeting individual members of protein families with high sequence similarity. A well-recognised example is the Bromodomain and Extraterminal domain (BET) family of proteins. Chemical inhibition of the acetyllysine (AcK)-binding bromodomains (BDs) of BET proteins has shown considerable promise in a range of disease models. However, despite over a decade of medicinal chemistry efforts, it has proven challenging to develop BET BD inhibitors that exhibit high selectivity between BET family paralogues. Cyclic peptides are versatile scaffolds for therapeutic development and often exhibit high selectivity and affinity for their targets. To explore their potential as selective BET BD inhibitors, we have used mRNA display to identify cyclic peptide ligands for the N-terminal BD of BRD2 and BRD4. The structurally diverse cyclic peptides enriched from the selections boast superior selectivity and affinity to previously developed inhibitors. Most strikingly, we isolated cyclic peptides with ~1000-fold higher affinity for their target BD over the paralogous BDs, far surpassing selectivities reported to date. Our biochemical and structural data suggest that paralogue-selective cyclic peptides act as molecular glues, exploiting both subtle sequence differences at locations far from the AcK-binding pocket and differences in conformational dynamics between BET BD paralogues to achieve this unprecedented level of specificity. This work provides a blueprint for the development of new classes of selective BET inhibitors and, more generally, underscores the potential of exploiting protein dynamics in the design of selective ligands.", "date": "2025-09-24", "journal": ""}

However, the evolutionary history and diversification patterns of NAC genes have not been examined systematically in land plants. By identifying 5052 NAC genes in 46 species of land plants and constructing their phylogenies, we found that NAC genes fell into three categories of evolutionary clades. An integrative analysis of evolutionary clades and synteny network revealed that NAC syntelogs exist widely across angiosperms, and ancient tandem duplications and multiple lineage-specific transposition events contributed to expansion and divergence of NAC family. Based on the reconstructed phylogenies, a potential evolutionary framework of NAC genes in land plants was presented, indicating that 13 ancestral genes which showed distinct expansion patterns evolved all current NAC repertoires of Arabidopsis and maize. ZmNAC genes exhibit divergent expression diversification patterns, which are generally in agreement with the expected clade- and ancestral gene specific expression characterization. The subcellular localization analysis of 14 ZmNAC proteins demonstrated that they are predominantly localized in the nucleus. Transcriptional activity analysis revealed their functional divergence in transcriptional activity. Through ZmNACs overexpression Arabidopsis, we identified the roles of ZmNACs under drought and salt stresses, thereby substantiating functional differentiation of NAC transcription factors in abiotic stress responses. Overall, the synteny network analysis and the reconstructed evolutionary framework of NAC genes in this study increased our understanding for the evolutionary history and functional consequences of NAC genes, and in return, ZmNAC expression profiles are also crucial for understanding the evolutionary sequence divergence from a functional perspective.

However, the mechanistic basis for these sex-specific disparities remains unclear. Methods: Here, we investigated endothelial cell (EC) function(s) in diabetes-associated PAD, with a focus on sex differences. Limb tissues from patients with diabetes and chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) undergoing amputation and a diabetes mouse model of hindlimb ischemia (HLI) were assessed for vasodilatory capacity, angiogenesis, oxidative stress and changes to expression of mitochondrial complex genes. ECs exposed to a diabetic environment in vitro were assessed for mitochondrial function. The therapeutic potential of the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant MitoQ was investigated. Results: ECs from females with diabetes-associated PAD have altered responses compared to males. Specifically, limb vessels and skeletal muscle from females exhibit reduced arterial relaxation, angiogenesis and increased oxidative stress in response to HLI in mice, and in tissues from patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing of murine limbs revealed marked suppression of EC mitochondrial complex genes in females with diabetes. Female human ECs exposed to high glucose had reduced respiration, reduced expression of mitochondrial genes and increased oxidative stress. Remarkably, MitoQ restored arterial relaxation and the angiogenic response in female diabetes-associated PAD.
