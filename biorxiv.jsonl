G.; Costantini, M.; Ferri, F.", "abstract": "The experience of pain, like other interoceptive processes, has recently been conceptualized in terms of predictive coding and free energy frameworks. In these views, the brain integrates sensory, proprioceptive, and interoceptive signals to generate probabilistic inferences about upcoming events, which shape both the state and the perception of our inner body. Here we ask whether it is possible to induce pain expectations by providing false faster (vs. slower) acoustic cardiac feedback before administering electrical cutaneous shocks. We test whether these expectations will shape both the perception of pain and the body's physiological state toward prior predictions. Results confirmed that faster cardiac feedback elicited pain expectations that affected both perceptual pain judgments and the body's physiological response. Perceptual pain judgments were biased towards the expected level of pain, such that participants illusorily perceived identical noxious stimuli as more intense and unpleasant. Physiological changes mirrored the predicted level of pain, such that participants' actual cardiac response in anticipation of pain stimuli showed a deceleration in heart rate, in line with the well-known orienting cardiac response in anticipation of threatening stimuli (Experiment 1). In a control experiment, such perceptual and cardiac modulations were dramatically reduced when the feedback reproduced an exteroceptive, instead of interoceptive, cardiac feedback (Experiment 2). These findings show that cardiac perception can be understood as interoceptive inference that modulates both our perception and the physiological state of the body, thereby actively generating the interoceptive and autonomic consequences that have been predicted.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Following years of pharmacological treatment, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a key hub in goal-direct behaviors, can be proposed. While HFS-STN reliably improves motor symptoms, it does not specifically address non-motor symptoms. Clarifying how STN dysfunction contributes to non-motor symptoms could thus improve STN stimulation strategies. Here, we longitudinally recorded STN local field potentials in two macaques performing a counter-demanding task during chronic low-dose MPTP treatment. This progressive model, evolving from an asymptomatic stage to motivational, cognitive and ultimately motor deficits, enabled detailed examination of non-motor stages preceding motor impairment. Each stage was associated with distinct STN electrophysiological alterations, including early loss of reward-related theta activity, subsequent disappearance of decision-related theta oscillations, and later reduction of movement-related beta rebound. In the stable parkinsonian stage, stimulation of different STN territories provided complementary behavioral effect: dorsal HFS-STN improved motor performances, whereas ventral low-frequency stimulation alleviated motivational deficits. These findings reveal a temporal link between STN dysfunction and symptom onset, and suggest site and frequency-specific stimulation as a strategy to address both motor and non-motor symptoms in PD.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

At the same time, accurate cell type annotation plays a crucial role in comprehending the cellular makeup of complex tissues and uncovering novel cell types. Unfortunately, the majority of existing methods primarily focus on label transfer within scRNA-seq datasets and only a limited number of approaches have been specifically developed for transferring labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq data. Moreover, many methods have been published for the joint embedding of data from the two modalities, which can be used for label transfer by adding a classifier trained on the latent space. Given these available methods, this study presents a comprehensive benchmarking study evaluating 27 computational tools for scATAC-seq label annotations through tasks involving single-cell RNA and ATAC data from various human and mouse tissues. We found that when high quality paired data were available to transfer labels across unpaired data, Bridge and GLUE were the best performers; otherwise, bindSC and GLUE achieved the highest prediction accuracy overall. All these methods were able to use peak-level information instead of purely relying on the gene activities from scATAC-seq. Furthermore, we found that data imbalance, cross-omics dissimilarity on common cell types, data binarization, and the introduction of semi-supervised strategy usually had negative impacts on model performance. In terms of scalability, we found that the most time and memory efficient methods were Bridge and deep-learning-based algorithms like GLUE.

Mapping how these organisational principles are altered or refined across development and phenotypes is essential to understanding the relationship between brain and behaviour. Taking a developmental approach and leveraging longitudinal and cross-sectional data from two multi-modal neuroimaging datasets, spanning the full neurotypical-neurodivergent continuum, we charted the organisational variability of structural (610 participants, N = 390 with one observation, N = 163 with two observations, and N = 57 with three) and functional (512 participants, N = 340 with one observation, N = 128 with two observations, and N = 44 with three). Across datasets, despite differing phenotypes, we observe highly similar structural and functional gradients. These gradients, or organisational principles, are highly stable across development, with the exact same ordering across early childhood into mid-adolescence. However, there is substantial developmental change in the strength of embedding within those gradients: by modelling developmental trajectories as non-linear splines, we show that structural and functional gradients exhibit sensitive periods and are refined across development. Specifically, structural gradients gradually contract in low-dimensional space as networks become more integrated, whilst the functional manifold expands, indexing functional specialisation. The coupling of these structural and functional gradients follows a unimodal-association axis and varies across individuals, with developmental effects concentrated in the more plastic higher-order networks. Importantly, these developmental effects on coupling, in these higher-order networks, are attenuated in the neurodivergent sample. Finally, we mapped structure-function coupling onto dimensions of psychopathology and cognition and demonstrate that dimensions of cognition, such as working memory, are robust predictors of coupling. In summary, across clinical and community samples, we demonstrate consistent principles of structural and functional brain organisation, with progressive structural integration and functional segregation. These gradients are established early in life, refined through development, and their coupling is predicted by working memory.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Proteins can diffuse micrometers in seconds, yet bacterial cells are able to maintain stable protein gradients. The best studied bacterial protein gradient is the Min system of Escherichia coli. In rod-shaped bacteria the MinCD proteins prevent formation of minicells by inhibiting FtsZ polymerization close to the cell poles. In E. coli these proteins oscillate between cell poles within a minute, resulting in an increased MinCD concentration at the poles. This oscillation is caused by the interaction between MinD and the protein MinE, which form an ATP-driven reaction-diffusion system, whereby the ATPase MinD cycles between a monomeric cytosolic and a dimeric membrane attached states. Bacillus subtilis also has MinCD, but lacks MinE. In this case MinCD form a static gradient that requires the transmembrane protein MinJ, located at cell poles and cell division sites. A recent reaction-diffusion model was successful in recreating the MinD gradient in B. subtilis, assuming that MinD cycles between cytosol and membrane, like in E. coli. Here we show that the monomeric and dimeric states of B. subtilis MinD have comparable membrane affinities, that MinD interacts with MinJ as a dimer, and that MinJ is not required for membrane localization of MinD. Based on these new findings we tested different models, using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, and found that a difference in diffusion rate between the monomer and dimer, rather than a difference in membrane affinity, is important for B. subtilis MinCD gradient formation.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

R.; Sanford, H.; Vinogradova, E. V.; de Lange, T.", "abstract": "Programmed telomere shortening limits tumorigenesis through the induction of replicative senescence. Here we address three long-standing questions concerning senescence. First, we show that the ATM kinase is solely responsible for the induction of replicative senescence. Senescence was delayed by ATM inhibition (ATMi) or overexpression of TRF2, the shelterin subunit dedicated to ATM repression. In contrast, there was no evidence for ATR signaling contributing to replicative senescence even when ATMi was combined with ATR inhibition. Second, we show ATMi can induce apparently normal cell divisions in a subset of senescent cells, indicating that senescence can be reversed. Third, we show that the extended replicative life span at low (physiological) oxygen is due to diminished ATM activity. At low oxygen, cells show a decreased ATM response to dysfunctional telomeres and genome-wide DSBs compared to 20% oxygen. As this effect could be reversed by NAC, the attenuated response of ATM to critically short telomeres and the resulting extended life span at low oxygen is likely due to ROS-induced formation of cysteine disulfide-bridges that crosslink ATM dimers into a form that is not activated by DSBs. These findings show how primary human cells detect shortened telomeres and reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the telomere tumor suppressor pathway.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Biochemical and single-molecule studies on DNA containing site-specific ICLs reveal that CSB increases the affinity of SNM1A to damaged DNA substrates and also alters the substrate conformation to enhance ICL processing by SNM1A. Notably, CSB was observed preferentially as a dimer when colocalised with SNM1A at ICLs, constrasting with its monomeric nature observed during repair initiation in classical transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair.

Potentially, this means the ecological interactions experienced by individual strains or species also vary among microbiomes of different people. However, testing this directly in human microbiomes and identifying ecological drivers involved is challenging. Here, we use replicated anaerobic microcosms to quantify variability of population growth for a key commensal species among microbiome samples from different individuals, and to identify underlying intra- and interspecific interactions. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, both absolute and relative growth performance of different Escherichia coli strains varied among gut microbiome samples from healthy individuals. This was partly explained by intraspecific competition: ecological success of individual E. coli strains was associated with displacement of resident conspecifics. However, the determinants of E. coli growth varied among samples. In one microbiome sample with a distinctive taxonomic composition, culture acidification by resident microbes impaired growth of all E. coli strains. We identified a strain of Clostridium butyricum contributing to this effect, and showed that transferring it into other microbiomes predictably altered pH, fermentation product profiles (butyrate accumulation and acetate/lactate depletion) and population growth of other species including E. coli, thereby reshaping overall taxonomic composition. Our results suggest natural inter-individual gut microbiome variation translates to variable ecological interactions with incoming bacteria, but these dynamics can be manipulated by a generalizable interspecies interaction.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Fungus gardens of attine ants in Brazil were surveyed to determine the presence of killer toxin-producing yeasts and to define their antifungal activities and ecological importance. Our results indicate that 10 out of 59 yeasts species isolated from fungal gardens are killer yeasts. Killer yeasts were less likely to inhibit the growth of yeasts isolated from the same environment but more effective at inhibiting yeast isolated from other environments, supporting a role for killer yeasts in shaping community composition. All killer yeasts harbored genome-encoded killer toxins lacked cytoplasmic toxin-encoding elements (i.e., double-stranded RNA satellites and linear double-stranded DNAs). Of all the killer yeasts associated with attine ants, Candida sinolaborantium (strain LESF 1467) showed a broad spectrum of antifungal activities against 39 out of 69 57% of yeast strains tested for toxin susceptibility. The complete genome sequence of C. sinolaborantium LESF 1467 identified a new killer toxin, Ksino, with similarities in primary sequence and tertiary structure to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae killer toxin named Klus. Surveys of publicly available genome databases identified homologs of Ksino in the genomes of yeast strains of Saccharomycetes and Pichiomycetes, as well as other species of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota filamentous fungi.

In budding yeast, the expression of 138 ribosomal protein (RP) genes and over 200 ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) genes is regulated by an intricate network of factors, including the nutrient-sensitive transcription activator Sfp1 and the NuA4 coactivator/acetyltransferase complex. Nutrient starvation or inhibition of TORC1 by rapamycin leads to repression of RP and RiBi genes, in part through blocking Sfp1 nuclear localization and NuA4-dependent chromatin acetylation. Here, we demonstrate that Sfp1 physically interacts with NuA4 in a TORC1-dependent manner. Our results indicate that Sfp1, along with NuA4, regulate the transcription of RiBi and RP genes via distinct mechanisms depending on promoter architectures. Sfp1 promotes histone acetylation at the promoters without affecting NuA4 recruitment. In contrast, NuA4 does impact Sfp1 binding but specifically at two classes of RP genes. Importantly, NuA4 acetylates Sfp1 at lysines 655 and 657, regulating its function. Cells expressing Sfp1 with acetyl-mimicking mutations exhibit increased expression of RiBi genes while RP genes remain stable. However, the same mutants lead to the loss of Sfp1 binding/activity at RiBi genes when cells are under non-optimal growth conditions. Mimicking constitutive acetylation of Sfp1 also limits the transcriptional burst of RP genes upon addition of glucose. Altogether, these results draw an intricate functional relationship between Sfp1 and NuA4 to control ribosome biogenesis, fine-tuning transcription output in different growth conditions.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Binding of Mediator and RNApII to the template required activator and an upstream activator sequence (UAS), but not a core promoter. While Mediator and RNApII sometimes bind as a pre-formed complex, more commonly Mediator binds first and subsequently recruits RNApII to form a preinitiation complex precursor (pre-PIC) tethered to activators on the UAS. Interestingly, Mediator occupancy has a highly non-linear response to activator concentration, and fluorescence intensity measurements show Mediator preferentially associates with templates having at least two activators bound.

Here, we test the hypothesis that this theta paradox can be explained by non-oscillatory, aperiodic neural activity dynamics. Because traditional time-frequency analyses of electroencephalography (EEG) data conflate oscillations and aperiodic activity, event-related changes in aperiodic activity can manifest as task-related changes in apparent oscillations, even when none are present. Reanalyzing EEG data from two visual WM experiments (n = 74, of either sex), and leveraging spectral parameterization, we found systematic changes in aperiodic activity with WM load, and we replicated classic alpha, but not theta, oscillatory effects after controlling for aperiodic changes. Aperiodic activity decreased during WM retention, and further flattened over the occipitoparietal cortex with an increase in WM load. After controlling for these dynamics, aperiodic-adjusted alpha power decreased with increasing WM load. In contrast, aperiodic-adjusted theta power appeared to increase during WM retention, but because aperiodic activity reduces more, it falsely appears as though theta oscillatory power (e.g., total band power) is reduced. Furthermore, only a minority of participants (31/74) had a detectable degree of theta oscillations.

Articles were assessed based on established criteria, including evidence for autophagy, evidence for cell death, exclusion of apoptosis, and experimental designs demonstrating causality. Our findings reveal that only 12.5% of the articles fulfilled all ACD criteria, while 37.5% provided only correlation-level evidence. Additionally, 54.81% failed to demonstrate autophagy flux, 32.7% relied on viability loss rather than direct evidence of cell death, and 45.0% of studies utilizing autophagy inhibition failed to demonstrate actual inhibition of autophagy. Inconsistent terminology was also prevalent, with \"autophagy-mediated cell death\" often misclassified as ACD and ACD frequently misused to describe autophagy co-occurring with cell death. These issues highlight a lack of rigor in current practices, with correlation-level evidence, inappropriate experimental designs, and terminological misuse undermining study robustness. To address these challenges, we developed a systematic workflow providing experimental and analytical guidance for classifying evidence for different modes of autophagy. Our analysis underscores the need for greater rigor, standardized approaches, and precise terminology to advance understanding of the interplay between autophagy and cell death.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Q.; Smith, A.; Gamborg, C.", "abstract": "Inclusive transformation critically depends on recognition of the plural values of nature held across societies. However, while conceptual frameworks increasingly acknowledge plurality of values, empirical tools to reliably assess these multiple value types and their sub-dimensions remain scarce. To explore plural values of nature, we introduce the Plural Values of Nature (PVN) scale, integrating intrinsic, instrumental, and relational values into one multi-dimensional scale. This psychometric scale builds on existing values literature and is explicitly designed to capture both distinctiveness and overlap of values. Using a seven-step process that includes qualitative and cognitive interviews, expert evaluations, and three rounds of quantitative pre-testing and validation, the scale is developed, refined, and validated across five European countries (representative sample; n = 1028). The final PVN scale consists of 11 items. The validation study shows moderate to high internal consistency, reliability, and validity of the scale across all countries. Based on the development and validation of the PVN, we discuss methodological and conceptual issues and unpack the plurality of values of nature. Empirically we explore the simultaneous endorsement of multiple values by people. Conceptually, we explore relations and potential overlap between the values based on the items used to measure these values. Predictive validity of the scale is considerable to high. Initial results show that considering the plurality of values is important to understand peoples attitudes towards e.g., nature restoration: People that endorse multiple values show more positive attitudes towards nature restoration than people endorsing only one specific value type (either instrumental, intrinsic, or relational values), with people endorsing all three value types simultaneously showing the highest support for such policies. Policy implications: The PVN scale is a tool that can help to take stock of the current values that societies have regarding the future development of nature, and as a monitoring tool to observe potential shifts in societal values over time. In addition, it can be used in survey research to understand attitudes towards use and protection of nature, and research on public support for transformative change. It may also facilitate dialogue around such issues.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

This resistance mechanism offers an opportunity to bolster MHC-I surface expression via therapeutic interventions. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of previously purported small molecule MHC-I inducers and identified heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors as privileged enhancers. Using a core scaffold, we employed an in situ click chemistry-based derivatization strategy to generate 380 novel compounds.

Ants, with diverse life histories and strong ecological effects, are ideal models to study these pressures. We investigated the response of ant communities, including taxonomic and functional diversity, to urbanisation and habitat fragmentation in the Paris region, comparing 24 urban parks vs 25 rural forests outside the city. We found a clear difference in species composition between urban and rural environments, with a higher prevalence of monogynous and thermophilic species in the city. Forest communities are homogeneous across the three fragmentation levels we studied, while park communities differ noticeably depending on park size, with larger parks harbouring more species. Our findings suggest that urbanisation selects specific ant traits and favours more thermophilic species, thereby increasing the mean thermal preference of urban communities. These selective effects influence which species can colonise and survive in different patches, shaping metacommunity structure and potentially affecting the resilience of ant communities under climate change.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Szczot, I.; Olausson, H.; McIntyre, S.", "abstract": "C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) have been highlighted in mediating the pleasantness of slow, caressing touch. This has given rise to the Affective Touch Hypothesis, which posits that velocity tuning of C-LTMRs underpins pleasantness perception. The known activation preferences of C-LTMRs have been used as a proxy for pleasant touch, yet recent findings have raised questions about the necessity of this peripheral mechanism. This project explored the peripheral and central mechanisms in a?ective touch through comparing two motion-conditions: gentle brushing-like motion and apparent motion, an illusory perception of movement produced by successive touches along the skin. We used this illusion to examine whether previously established velocity tuning of true lateral motion is observed in apparent motion, when local information provided to individual peripheral afferents is held constant. The sole dependence on peripheral modulation predicts that the characteristic inverted-U-shaped relationship between velocity and pleasantness, regularly associated with C-LTMRs, would only be observed for brushing-like motion. Central modulation would instead predict a more similar relationship between the motion-conditions. To investigate this, pleasantness-ratings and velocity-ratings were collected across different velocities (0.1-30cm/s, N=23) for both conditions. Linear and quadratic regression analyses were performed and for both conditions adding a quadratic term improved the overall model fit, reaching significance (p<0.001). The quadratic term coefficients were negative for both conditions, displaying an inverted-U-shape. Further analyses revealed that motion-condition did not significantly alter the relationship between stimulus-velocity and pleasantness. These findings suggest that the velocity tuning of pleasantness cannot solely be attributed to velocity tuning of individual C-LTMRs.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Pezeshkian, W.", "abstract": "Among the fascinating shapes that biomembranes exhibit are stomatocytes with multiple membrane necks, found for example in nuclear membranes and open autophagosomes. These morphologies, characterised by a high topological genus, can be visualised as spherical double membranes connected by neck-like structures. The necks are often occupied by specific biomolecular complexes, such as the nuclear pore complex, which divide the space into three distinct compartments. Understanding how the size of these necks responds to pressure gradients is fundamentally important for unravelling the influence of mechanical stimuli on traffic control through the necks, for example, in nuclear mechanosensing. In this work, we use computer simulations and theoretical analysis to investigate how neck size responds to variations in pressure or tension. Our findings reveal a two-phase behaviour: below a certain threshold, necks constrict as the pressure gradient increases, while above that threshold, they dilate. This response stems from the pure membrane's mechanics and depends on the magnitude of the pressure gradient, the initial diameter of the neck and the membrane bending rigidity. We also provide a simple equation that links the threshold tension, the neck diameter and the bending rigidity, offering a useful tool to quickly assess different scenarios. Our results furthermore show that protein complexes in the neck partially counteract both constriction and dilation, stabilising neck size while preserving the same two-phase response to membrane tension. These findings uncover a promising, previously overlooked membrane property with implications for organelle shape and function, as well as for synthetic membrane design.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

We developed a massively parallel dual reporter assay that enables simultaneous assessment of the intrinsic promoter and enhancer potential exerted by the same sequence. Parallel quantification for thousands of elements reveals that canonical human promoters and enhancers can act as both promoters and enhancers under the same contexts, and that promoter activity may be necessary but not sufficient for enhancer function. Perturbations to element transcription factor binding motifs lead to disruptions in both activities, implicating a shared syntax for the two regulatory functions. Combinations of elements with different minimal promoters reveal reciprocal activity modulation, which, together with a strong correlation between promoter and enhancer functions, imply a bidirectional feedback loop to sustain environments of high transcriptional activity. Finally, we validate this reciprocity and correlation in situ using CRISPR activation at the human {beta}-globin locus. Our approach reveals that the functional convergence between promoters and enhancers arises from a shared regulatory logic and sequence syntax, advancing a unified model for regulatory element biology.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

So far, hyperscanning studies have examined synchrony across different dyads and tasks, leading to inconsistencies in experimental findings and limiting cross-study comparability. This variability has posed challenges for building a unified theoretical framework for neural synchrony. This study investigated the effects of interpersonal closeness and social interactivity on neural synchrony using functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning. We recorded brain activity from 142 dyads (70 close-friend, 39 romantic-partner, and 33 mother-child dyads) across three interaction conditions: video co-exposure (passive), a cooperative game (structured active), and free interaction (unstructured active). Neural synchrony was computed between participants' bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) using wavelet transform coherence. Results showed that true dyads exhibited significantly higher synchrony than non-interacting surrogate dyads (qs < .001, Cohen's d range: 0.17-0.32), particularly in combinations involving the right IFG. Mother-child dyads displayed lower synchrony than adult-adult dyads at the network (p < .001) and local level of analysis, pointing to possible developmental and maturational influences on neural synchrony. At the network level, synchrony was highest during video co-exposure, followed by the cooperative game and free interaction (p < .001). However, left IFG-left IFG and left IFG-right TPJ synchrony peaked during the cooperative game. Although these effects were statistically significant, the overall impact of social interactivity on interpersonal neural synchrony was small, suggesting that the complexity and richness of social exchanges alone may only modestly influence neural synchrony in naturalistic contexts. By comparing different types of dyads and interaction contexts, this study highlights factors that may guide future hypothesis-driven hyperscanning research and contribute incremental evidence to ongoing efforts to understand the neural mechanisms underlying human social interactions.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

However, the protein target(s) of AA263 and the potential for further development of this class of ER proteostasis regulators had not been previously explored. Here, we employ chemical proteomics to demonstrate that AA263 covalently targets a subset of ER protein disulfide isomerases, revealing a potential molecular mechanism for the activation of ATF6 afforded by this compound. We then use medicinal chemistry to establish next-generation AA263 analogs showing improved potency and efficacy for ATF6 activation, as compared to the parent compound.

Behavioral experiments revealed that observers could categorize style-synthesized versions of natural scene and object images with high accuracy. Furthermore, we recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for the original, SS, and PS images and decoded natural scene and object categories using a support vector machine (SVM). Consistent with the behavioral results, natural scene categories were decoded with high accuracy within 200 ms after the stimulus onset. In contrast, object categories were successfully decoded only from VEPs for original images at later latencies. Finally, we examined whether style features could classify natural scene and object categories. The classification accuracy for natural scene categories showed a similar trend to the behavioral data, whereas that for object categories did not align with the behavioral results.

C.; Glasser, M. F.", "abstract": "Cortical thickness is a widely used biomarker of brain morphology and health, yet it is dependent on local cortical folding. Because gyral crowns are consistently thicker than sulcal fundi and cortical folds vary widely across individuals, these fluctuations introduce unmodeled nuisance variance that can obscure meaningful biological effects of interest. Previous global methods of folding compensation incompletely compensate for folding effects on cortical thickness. Spatial smoothing is commonly used to reduce these effects in the literature, but this markedly degrades spatial localization precision. To address these limitations, we developed a novel method for folding-compensated cortical thickness estimation that uses nonlinear local multiple regression with five folding measures to model and more completely remove folding-related variance from cortical thickness. This approach estimates what cortical thickness would have been in the absence of folding, yielding a more biologically interpretable measure of cortical architecture. We applied this new approach to data from the Young Adult Human Connectome Project (HCP-YA) and Aging Human Connectome Project (HCA), demonstrating substantial reductions in intra-areal and inter-individual variability, substantially increasing standardized effect sizes of age on cortical thickness (41% increase) while preserving neurobiologically expected patterns, and avoiding the loss of spatial precision that occurs with the spatial smoothing that has traditionally been used in the literature. The method has been integrated into the HCP pipelines, facilitating its widespread use. By attenuating folding-induced variability, this technique enhances cortical thickness as a structural phenotype and may support more accurate cortical parcellation, longitudinal tracking, and biomarker discovery in brain health and disease.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Sign epistasis is characterized by alleles having either a beneficial or detrimental effect depending on the genetic background, which can result in elite lines that fail as parents in certain parental combinations. Hence, the objective of this study were to test the existence of sign epistasis and examine its consequences to wheat breeding. The presence of sign epistasis is expected to distort the allele frequency distribution between two interacting genes compared to neutral sites, creating strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). To test this hypothesis, analysis of interchromosomal LD in breeding families was performed and detected 19 regions in strong disequilibrium, whose allele frequency distribution matched the sign epistasis prediction and falsified the competing hypothesis of additive selection. To validate these candidate interactions while avoiding the biases of a circular analysis and the confounding effects of genetic drift, two independent sets of populations were analyzed. Genetic drift was attributed to creating the sign epistasis patterns observed in eleven interactions, but there was not sufficient evidence to reject the sign epistasis hypothesis in eight interactions. Sign epistasis may explain the poor performance of elite lines as parents, as crossing lines with complementary allelic combination re-establishes epistatic variance in the offspring. Reduction in the effective population size in certain crosses may also occur when unfavorable sign epistatic combinations are deleterious. The potential existence of di-genic and higher order epistatic interactions in elite germplasm can tremendously impact breeding strategies as managing epistasis becomes imperative for success.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

To understand how HDPs can penetrate colistin resistant membranes we performed a deep mutational scanning analysis of protegrin-1 and revealed that amino acids mutations that resulted in alteration of peptide structure had more impact on antimicrobial activity than a reduction in charge. Probing single and double amino acid variants using membrane analysis and molecular modeling revealed the loss of antimicrobial activity correlated with decreased inner membrane leakage and pore modeling predicting decreased pore size.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce the responsivity framework, a predictive model that formalises the scaling between echo delay, call rate, and relative velocity through a single parameter--the responsivity coefficient kr. From this relation, we derive biologically interpretable quantities such as the reaction window Tb and the buzz-readiness threshold, marking the onset of a high-gain sensorimotor regime preceding the terminal buzz. Simulations of bat-prey interactions, incorporating both stationary and motile targets, reproduced systematic velocity-call-rate trade-offs and realistic behavioural profiles, from which distances, velocities, and reaction times could be inferred using call timing alone. Internal consistency checks confirmed that the framework's analytical identities for distance and velocity hold across sequences, while spatio-temporal maps revealed how Tb contracts with increasing kr and velocity, defining the biophysical limit of temporal control. Comparisons with high-resolution field recordings showed that observed call-rate dynamics followed the predicted trends, with variability arising from environmental context and localisation uncertainty. By linking simple acoustic observables to a broad set of derived parameters, the responsivity framework provides a mechanistic and predictive tool for interpreting echolocation behaviour. It explains variable buzz lengths and reaction limits consistent with experimental observations. It establishes a general principle: sequential adaptive behaviours unfold under constraints set by the speed of regulatory feedback. While demonstrated in bat biosonar, this principle offers broader relevance to understanding adaptive control and sensory-motor integration across biological systems.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

This was recently confirmed through the cultivation of two classes of methanogenic Thermoproteota. Thus far, all methanogens within the Thermoproteota are predicted or were shown to be methylotrophic. The only exception to this are the Nezhaarchaea, which, based on metagenomics, are predicted to be CO2-reducing methanogens.

We expand the metabolic diversity of this class by cultivating a methylotrophic species, Candidatus Methanonezhaarchaeum fastidiosum YNP3N. Contrary to genomic predictions, strain YNP3N is unable to grow by hydrogenotrophic CO2-reducing methanogenesis, highlighting the importance of testing metagenomic hypotheses through experimentation. Further, we describe novel genes involved in methanogenesis that are not found in other methanogens.

Early and late droughts shortened flowering duration: early drought delayed onset, late drought advanced termination. Some shifts were direct, others emerged through competition. A new community-level index revealed greater phenological segregation in mixtures, showing that plasticity alone can generate niche separation under competition.

In the Amazon more than one-third of forests have been altered through human activities, with major implications for wildlife communities. While Earth observation satellites effectively monitor forest cover at scale, it remains unclear how well satellite-derived variables capture variation in bird communities. We tested whether Landsat reflectance and vegetation indices can predict bird species occurrence and community composition in the Peruvian Amazon. We analysed 3,129 point counts and mist-net bird surveys conducted over 16 years in the Tambopata Forest, south-eastern Peru. As predictors we compared the effectiveness of remote sensing derived surface reflectance and vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI and tasselled cap), with traditional land-type and forest cover descriptors. Species occurrence probabilities and community composition of 135 frequently recorded bird species were estimated using multi-species occupancy models that account for imperfect detection. Models using Landsat reflectance and vegetation indices outperformed those based on habitat categories in predicting species occupancy (mean AUC = 0.68 vs 0.58). They also achieved high predictive accuracy (AUC > 0.7) for more species (49 compared with 20). However, low detection rates across surveys limited all models ability to accurately estimate full community composition and to detect change over time. Our results demonstrate that satellite-derived variables can improve predictions of bird occurrence compared with habitat categories, but their effectiveness depends strongly on survey design and species detectability.

Increasing corticothalamic layer 6 firing rates exerted a transition from inhibition to excitation across cortical layers.

While epigenetic aging is emerging as a valuable approach, only nine species-specific clocks currently exist. Most have been calibrated using captive known-age animals or well-studied wild populations. Only two previous studies have used dental ages from stranded or bycaught individuals. This is due to concerns that dental age inaccuracies, especially in older animals, may affect epigenetic clock performance. To explore this, we developed the first species-specific epigenetic clock for common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), analysing DNA methylation at 37,492 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites in skin samples from stranded and bycaught dolphins with estimated dental ages. Elastic net models with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation were applied to three subsets: the 'relaxed' subset (all individuals; n = 75, median absolute error (MAE) = 2.02, r = 0.81, R2 = 0.66), the 'strict' subset (excluding individuals with minimum dental age estimates only; n = 73, MAE = 2.29, r = 0.81, R2 = 0.66), and the 'restricted' subset (excluding outliers with prediction errors > 6 years; n = 63, MAE = 1.80, r = 0.91, R2 = 0.82) to compare performance. Our models consistently underestimated the age of dolphins >16 years, even when minimum dental ages were applied, suggesting absolute errors between dental and epigenetic estimates unlikely reflect dental aging error. Additionally, post-mortem decomposition condition code (DCC 1 to 3) did not affect age prediction, signalling promise for future epigenetic clocks calibrated with strandings and bycaught individuals.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Using voxelwise encoding models, we tested whether fMRI activity patterns evoked when a scene was re-encountered carried information about the original encounter's temporal context. Indeed, we found robust temporal context reinstatement within high-level visual cortex (lateral occipitotemporal cortex; LOTC), despite the fact that reinstated content was entirely incidental to task demands. However, temporal context reinstatement only occurred when stimuli were successfully recognized, indicating that reinstatement was behaviorally-relevant, even if incidental.

While laboratory mice are central to immunological research, their immune systems differ significantly from those of their wild counterparts who are exposed to more intense immunological stimulation from a broader range of infections. We performed high-throughput sequencing of the TCR alpha and beta chains of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells isolated from 65 wild Mus musculus domesticus captured at two UK sites. We analysed repertoire richness and diversity in relation to mouse age, sex, and sample location. The results show that wild mice have large TCR repertoires. We found that repertoire richness, which measures the breadth of the repertoire, was not significantly affected by mouse age or sex, suggesting that wild mice maintain the capacity to respond to novel antigens throughout their lives. In contrast, repertoire diversity (measured by Shannons index) was affected by mouse sex and age. This low diversity, coupled with constant richness, points to older mice having comparatively more highly abundant clones in their repertoires, likely because of chronic exposure to persistent pathogens in their environment. Individual mice shared a considerable number of TCR sequences, with greater sharing observed between mice from the same location, suggesting that local environmental pressures shape the TCR repertoire. These findings provide a novel and valuable description of the wild mouse TCR, revealing an immune system that balances maintaining a broad response capacity with developing strong, lasting responses to infections in the natural environment.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Neural predictive activity emerged rapidly, with stimulus-specific patterns appearing before stimulus onset and preceding measurable behavioral improvements. This is followed by a slower build-up of representational change, characterized by an increased neural pattern similarity between statistically dependent, non-adjacent elements. Both processes are supported by a distributed consortium of networks, with the sensorimotor and dorsal attentional networks playing a central role.

However, the complex life cycles and body plans of seaweeds pose a huge challenge for the development of standardized phenotyping and isolating protocols for microscopic stages, especially with the efficiency necessary to deal with the current pace of global climatic changes. Here, we present SAMMBA (Seaweed Automatable Microplate Microscopy for Breeding Approaches), an end-to-end pipeline for the high-throughput isolation, phenotyping and storage of macroalgal cells in 384-well plates (384WP). By optimizing fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis, along with a novel fragmentation method and dilution-to-extinction isolation, different unialgal seaweed tissues could be regrown after thousand-fold dilutions. In a single plate, we successfully isolated 68 singlet gametophyte fragments of Laminaria ochroleuca (39 males, 29 females; 17.7% efficiency) and 60 spores of Phyllariopsis purpurascens (31.25% efficiency). Furthermore, the taxonomic versatility of SAMMBA was demonstrated through the successful isolation of 60 unialgal cultures of red algae ( Halymenia sp., Hydrolithon sp., Erythrotrichia sp.) and 10 strains of the green alga Ulva sp, without cross-contamination. The viability and unialgal nature of the isolated strains were verified by distributing a single L. ochroleuca strain across an entire 384-well plate and imaging each well over 40 days. We found that the average specific daily growth rates (daily SGR) per well were 0.130 {+/-} 0.006 and 0.117 {+/-} 0.01 day-1 for males and females, respectively, showing a significant difference between sexes (n = 768; p = 1.27e-53), while edge effects significantly reduced daily SGR in males but not in females. This approach dramatically increases experimental reproducibility and statistical power compared to conventional methods. Due to its modular design and cost-effectiveness, SAMMBA is readily adaptable to macroalgal repositories globally. It supports high-throughput, selective recovery of unialgal strains without reliance on robotic platforms, while remaining fully compatible with automation. This system significantly expands the experimental and operational capacity in macroalgal hatcheries, providing a scalable foundation for phenomics, domestication programs, and standardized, verifiable biobanking of unialgal strains.

Among these, RNA stability emerges as a previously underappreciated regulator of gene expression, exerting a stronger influence than transcription on total RNA levels for ~15% of activity-dependent genes. We go on to profile 3'UTR mRNA motifs that are sufficient to modulate activity-dependent mRNA stability and employ machine learning to identify the neuronal-specific RNA-binding protein HuD as a key regulator of activity-dependent mRNA stabilization. We demonstrate that HuD shapes activity-dependent mRNA abundance of hundreds of transcripts in both soma and distal neuronal processes and that neuronal activity drives the reorganization of HuD-interacting proteins, thereby stabilizing HuD-bound mRNAs and directing them into translationally active granules. Finally, we find that many variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders disrupt or promote aberrant activity-dependent changes in mRNA stability.

With over 90 species and varieties, 40% of which exhibit polyploidy, aneuploidy, or other cytological complexities, Packera presents significant challenges for phylogenetic reconstruction. Given these complexities, we assessed different published paralog processing methods on the resulting evolutionary relationships and phylogenetic support of this group. We then applied three of these methods to evaluate their impact on tree topology and our understanding of Packera's evolutionary history by constructing a time-calibrated phylogeny, reconstructing historical biogeography, and testing for ancient reticulation. Phylogenetic outcomes varied based on the paralog processing method used, with no method performing the best over others. Our findings highlight the large impact of orthology inference and paralog processing on phylogenomic analyses, particularly in polyploid-rich groups such as Packera, and we offer guidance on methodological impacts along with practical recommendations. We note that gaining a robust understanding of Packera's evolutionary history requires more than computational approaches alone. While technological advancements have greatly expanded our ability to analyze genomic data, effective phylogenomic research still relies on strong taxon sampling and detailed species knowledge.

Here we show that Chai-1, a publicly available structure prediction tool that accepts user-defined ligands, is able to accurately predict covalent K-Ras(G12C) complexes without using a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Chai-1 yields pocket-aligned RMSDs <2 [A] for chemically diverse K-Ras(G12C) inhibitors, ranging from ARS-853 to BBO-8520. In addition to the conventional acrylamide-based covalent K-Ras(G12C) inhibitors, Chai-1 with a covalent-bond restraint successfully reproduced the binding poses of covalent K-Ras(G12D) and K-Ras(G12S) inhibitors, while showing limitations in capturing chemical details such as accounting for leaving-groups, bond properties, and stereochemistry. Chai-1 also provides ~40-fold higher throughput than state-of-the-art AlphaFold3 while maintaining comparable pose accuracy. Together, these findings establish Chai-1 as an accessible and computationally efficient tool for covalent protein-ligand co-complex structure prediction, with its covalent-restraint mode offering a unique solution to accelerate covalent drug discovery, especially for challenging targets beyond cysteine.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

In contrast, lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)-based diagnostics are popular point-of-care tests due to their simplicity and user-friendly format but lack sensitivity for detecting the low concentrations of proteins that are present early in infections and among asymptomatic individuals. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel biosensor platform utilizing antibody-initiated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (ai-LAMP) with an LFIA readout for protein detection. This platform integrates protein-specific antibody-antigen binding with the robust signal amplification of LAMP. By conjugating pairs of antibodies to overlapping DNA strands, the presence of a target protein brings the DNA strands into proximity, completing a DNA target to initiate the LAMP reaction without any additional ligation step. This approach facilitates the rapid detection of low concentration proteins with a clear visual readout and can be performed in 3 steps from sample to answer. Using ai-LAMP we detected HIV-1 p24 on commercially available LFIAs at a limit of detection (LOD) of 20 fM (0.53 pg/mL), demonstrating 40x improvement over existing HIV p24 LFIAs. The use of ai-LAMP eliminates the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment to detect protein targets in low concentrations, paving a new way for rapid and accessible biomarker detection in clinical and research settings.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Development of a broadly extendible dispenser would be a beneficial ecological tool. A camera-based edge device with an onboard deep learning model can be used to identify the target species using image classification. It is important to choose a suitable edge device for the dispenser's effective application in power constrained environments. We evaluated four edge devices for the smart bait dispenser- ArduinoPro Nicla Vision, ArduinoPro Portenta H7 with Vision Shield (LoRa), Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Two simple convolutional neural networks, and four fine-tuned pretrained models (MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3Small, ResNet50V2, and ResNet152V2) were trained on trail camera images of devil and non-devil species. These models were evaluated across four metrics and post-training quantised for deployment. The edge devices were assessed on inference latency of each model in seconds (s) and power consumption in watt (W). We found that a simple CNN based image classification model yielded the best overall result of {approx}96% across all metrics. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ and Zero 2 W could run all the six models whereas Portenta failed to run the two ResNet models and Nicla Vision failed to run all four pretrained models. All edge devices were found to be quick enough for dispenser application (average inference latency of 0.718 s). Portenta consumed the lowest power during inference (0.19 W), idle (0.185 W), and light sleep (0.045 W) states whereas Nicla Vision consumed the lowest power during deep sleep (0.002 W). Overall, we found that simple traditional CNNs was best suited for species classification in a camera-based smart bait dispenser for vaccination of Tasmanian devils. We conclude that ArduinoPro Portenta H7 with Vision Shield is the most competent device for this edge AI application. We suggest integration of this system with a microcontroller unit like ATtiny85 to minimise inactive power consumption of the dispenser. This method can be readily adapted for other species in vaccination and supplemental feeding projects.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

SCREAM leverages Stacked Autoencoders (SAEs) to generate robust latent representations for each omics modality as well as for their fusion. Subsequently, borrowing Deep Embedding Clustering (DEC), SCREAM iteratively fine tunes the integrated mulitomics latent space and single-cell cluster assignments. Results: We evaluated SCREAM against eleven state-of-the-art methods using SNARE-seq and CITE-seq datasets. In this benchmarking, SCREAM consistently demonstrated superior performance, yielding the highest or near-highest Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) scores on both datasets. These findings validate SCREAM as a highly accurate and robust approach for identifying cell types from multiomics data.

Using ultra-high field 7T magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how arousal modulates processing of emotional faces during an oddball task in twenty-two young adults during two separate sessions. Arousal induced by isometric handgrip increased LC cerebral blood flow and amplified brain responses to target and angry faces, but not to happy faces. The amygdala exhibited valence-general responses that were not modulated by arousal. LC connectivity with the default mode network decreased during processing target and angry faces, and arousal further modulated responses in the salience network and visual cortex. Behaviorally, arousal enhanced recognition of angry faces only when allocating attentional resources and memory performance was linked to left LC brain activity.

Evolutionarily conserved, Notch plays a key role in numerous cell fate decisions during development and is also required in post-mitotic brain neurons for the consolidation of long-term memory and long-term habituation. Notch signaling is highly expressed in glial cells, where it plays a key role in regulating their development and proliferation. More recently, a Notch-dependent neuroglial pathway has been implicated in modulating the susceptibility of short-term memory to sleep deprivation in Drosophila. In this study, we demonstrate that canonical Notch signaling in glia-- mediated by the Delta ligand and the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless--is activated in a subset of cortex and ensheathing glial cells. This signaling is essential for the formation of short-term memory in the aversive phototaxic suppression assay, which is sensitive to sleep deprivation. Dopaminergic transmission is known to be required for this type of learning and is negatively impacted by sleep deprivation, suggesting a possible interaction between Notch and dopamine pathways. Supporting this idea, we find that modulating dopaminergic transmission downregulates canonical Notch activity in glial cells. Conversely, activating Notch signaling in glia near dopaminergic neurons prevents the learning impairments typically caused by sleep deprivation. Notably, Notch signaling itself does not appear to alter dopamine levels in the brain. Together, these findings indicate that canonical Notch signaling in a specific subset of glial cells is essential for short-term memory formation and is modulated by dopaminergic signaling. This suggests that sleep loss-induced disruption of dopaminergic transmission impairs learning by downregulating canonical Notch signaling. Since Notch homologs are highly expressed in mammalian glia, this pathway may be conserved and functionally relevant in other species, including humans.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

We developed a digital PCR based model targeting conserved regions of the -tubulin gene, enabling biomass quantification of both pathogens during infection. Field surveys revealed up to two in three symptomatic infections involved both pathogens, with co-infected plants showing significantly higher individual pathogen biomass than single-species infections. Host plants in the field with moderate resistance to both pathogens were found to be significantly more necrotic under co-infection, with individual pathogen biomass up to twice that observed value for single infections. However, like fair-weather friends the partnership between these two pathogens seems to be conditional. When P. tritici-repentis established first, secondary P. nodorum colonisation led to a breakdown of host resistance. Conversely, when P. nodorum established on the host first, it suppressed P. tritici-repentis colonisation regardless of host resistance. To our knowledge this is the first description of asymmetric priority effects overcoming host resistance in a plant pathosystem.

L.; Thomas, S.; Kiebler, M.; Boyce, A.; Goetze, B.", "abstract": "Quantitative fluorescence microscopy is more reproducible when instrument performance is measured and incorporated into the analysis. We show that routinely monitored quality-control (QC) metrics like the system resolution and inter-channel co-registration are determinant variables that can be used to normalize common image readouts and thereby separate instrument-induced variation from genuine biological changes. For intra-channel morphometry, a Gaussian approximation of the fluorescence imaging process yields analytical factors that predict how geometric measurements (length, separation distance, area, volume, etc.) inflate and scale with resolution blur due to optical misalignments or natural optical quality variations. We validate this behavior by deliberately perturbing the system resolution and by exploiting the natural resolution differences in three nominally equivalent objective lenses configured to image the exact same synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons, where structural differences subtle by eye nonetheless produced statistically significant shifts in measured synaptic puncta volumes. For dual-channel colocalization (overlap) measurements, we normalize the inter-channel co-registration QC metric by the measured point-spread function (PSF) resolutions (rather than theoretical limits associated with the objective lens) and demonstrate how fluorescent pre/postsynaptic cleft protein overlap signals decay in a predictable, exponential fashion as the PSF-normalized registration error increases, with the decay rate depending on the imaged object relative to the PSF size ratio. Mapped field-of-view gradients in channel registration also explain feature orientation flips/rotations and overlap loss without any underlying biological change . Finally, we outline a simple QC-aware microscope normalization workflow where each image measurement dataset is paired with its session PSFs and local co-registration error to remove instrument bias and optionally re-project the results to a declared reference PSF without altering the raw images. This approach improves image measurement accuracy and cross-instrument comparability of experiments and reframes light microscope QC from a passive certification of instrument health into a practical normalization that links the acquisition state to quantitative outcomes, thus ensuring the reliability and interpretability of morphometric and colocalization data in fluorescence microscopy.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Retinas from early-stage Ins2Akita mice exhibited increases in CE deposition, superoxide production, and expression of ACAT1/SOAT1, LDLR, TREM1, MCSF, and VEGF along with leukostasis, vascular leakage, acellular capillary formation, retinal ganglion cell loss, and impaired visual function.

QA is a NAD biosynthesis intermediate metabolized by the enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT).

Systematic metabolomic profiling identified endogenous QA as one of the most significantly elevated metabolites following folic acid-(FA) induced injury.

In the presence of ADP, M5 bound to F-actin by both heads makes a forward step when the trailing head is detached by an external force. This forward step harnesses the strain energy in the leading (L) head, provided from the strong binding energy between the L-head and actin. Consequently, strain generation reduces the binding affinity, which manifests as sporadic, brief L-head detachment. Strain generation and brief L-head detachment also occur during ATP-dependent walking to similar extents as during ATP-free walking.

Moreover, Recombination Signal Binding Protein for Immunoglobulin Kappa J region (RBPJ), which is a transcription factor typically involved in the canonical Notch signaling process, dampened this epigenetic modification, enhanced apoptotic cell clearance, and suppressed inflammation by mouse atherosclerotic plaque, alveolar, peritoneal, and bone marrow-derived macrophages and human primary macrophages. Inhibition of the Notch signaling in macrophages significantly reduced efferocytosis whereas activation of this signaling augmented apoptotic debris clearance.

M.; Ahmad, I.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) aggregation, with soluble oligomers implicated as the most neurotoxic species. Recent evidence suggests microbial infections, including Helicobacter pylori, contribute to AD pathogenesis. This study investigates the role of H. pylori GroEL, a conserved chaperonin found in bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), in stabilizing toxic A{beta} oligomers. A pan-genome analysis of 353 H. pylori strains identified GroEL as a highly conserved protein present in 83% of strains, which supported its widespread relevance. We structurally modelled a conserved 27-amino acid GroEL fragment and docked it against the A{beta} (1-42) tetramer. Interaction analysis revealed stabilizing salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and extensive non-bonded contacts within the GroEL-A{beta} complex. Molecular dynamics simulations (50 ns) demonstrated that GroEL binding enhanced A{beta} oligomer stability, evidenced by reduced structural deviations and a more extensive hydrogen bonding network compared to A{beta} oligomer alone. These computational findings support a novel mechanism whereby H. pylori GroEL directly stabilizes soluble A{beta} oligomers. We hypothesize that this stabilization inhibits their aggregation into plaques while paradoxically prolonging the lifetime of neurotoxic species, potentially increasing neurodegeneration through pathways distinct from canonical amyloid deposition. This highlights the complex role of bacterial proteins in AD and underscores the need for experimental validation of GroEL-A{beta} interactions as a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Despite its significant role in disease transmission, genomic data for this species remain limited. Here, we present the first chromosome-scale genome assembly of D. reticulatus, constructed using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data. Methods High molecular weight DNA was extracted from a female Dermacentor reticulatus collected in Devon, UK, and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore long-read technology. Genome assemblies were generated using both guided and unguided approaches, followed by repeat masking, gene prediction, and functional annotation. Genome completeness was assessed using BUSCO, and comparative, phylogenetic, and functional analyses were performed against other Dermacentor and tick species. Results This chromosome-scale genome assembly revealed a repeat-rich genome, with approximately 61.9% of the total sequence consisting of repetitive elements. Benchmarking universal single-copy ortholog (BUSCO) analysis demonstrated strong genome completeness, with guided assembly (chromosome) achieving a score of 97.1%, closely matching those of related Dermacentor species. For comparison, unguided assembly (scaffold) yielded a BUSCO score of 96.7%. Gene annotation following repeat masking resulted in BUSCO completeness scores of 95.1% (guided) and 95.0% (unguided). Functional characterisation included Pfam domain assignment and Gene Ontology analysis. Additionally, we assembled the mitochondrial genome (15,103 bp), comprising 38 genes, providing further insight into D. reticulatus phylogenetic placement. Conclusions This genomic resource establishes a foundation for functional genomics, evolutionary studies and supports future research in vector biology and the control of tick-borne diseases.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

We identified transcriptional regulators for each of these states and characterized 31 regulators at the single-cell transcriptomic and cell-surface proteome level in two distinct iPSC-derived microglia models.

J.; Kuyat, J. R.; Sylwestrak, E. L.", "abstract": "Evaluating outcomes to accurately predict which actions lead to reward is crucial for survival. Discrepancies between expected and realized outcomes, termed reward prediction errors, serve as a teaching signal to update subsequent predictions and promote adaptive behavior. Neural correlates of prediction errors have been identified in several brain regions, including the lateral habenula (LHb), which contains a subpopulation of neurons encoding negative RPEs (nRPEs) that are excited by worse-than-expected outcomes and inhibited by better-than-expected outcomes. LHb projections to the midbrain shape firing in dopaminergic neurons and play a well-established role in reward learning and decision-making. However, the LHb engages in a wide variety of behaviors beyond reward processing, and it remains unclear whether these distinct functions are mediated by specific transcriptionally defined cell types. Little is known about the transcriptomic identity of nRPE-encoding neurons, limiting our understanding of the specific role of these signals in outcome valuation. Using cell type-specific recording in mice performing reward-guided tasks, we demonstrate neurons expressing the neuropeptide gene Tachykinin-1 (Tac1) represent a subpopulation of LHb neurons encoding reward prediction errors. We found LHbTac1 reward outcome responses are sensitive to changes in both the expected value and realized value of rewards, and their activity scales with the magnitude of the difference. Further, LHbTac1 neurons show little modulation to other task-related events, or to innately aversive stimuli that engage a broader population of LHb cell types. Together, these data demonstrate that Tac1 marks a subpopulation of LHb neurons that preferentially encodes nRPE. Our results provide insight into cell type-specific contributions of habenular neurons in RPE signaling and open avenues for more targeted manipulations of nRPE-encoding neurons to understand their role in reward-guided behavior.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "The proper establishment of cell form, fate, and function during morphogenesis requires precise coordination between cell polarity and developmental cues. To achieve this, cells must establish polarity domains that are stable yet sensitive to guiding cues. Here we show that C. elegans germline blastomeres resolve this trade-off by creating a time-varying polarization landscape. Specifically, coupling the PAR polarity network to the cell-cycle kinase CDK-1 ensures that newborn cells operate in a low-feedback regime that lowers barriers to polarity state switching, allowing spatial cues to induce and orient PAR protein asymmetries. As CDK-1 activity rises at mitotic entry, increasing molecular feedback reinforces cue-induced asymmetries to yield robust and stable patterning of PAR domains. Consistent with this model, optogenetic and chemical perturbations show that low-CDK/low-feedback regimes destabilize PAR domains but are required for both de novo polarization and the reorientation of polarity in response to inductive cues. We propose that mitotic oscillations in cell polarity circuits dynamically optimize the polarization landscape to enable coordination of polarity with morphogenesis. Such temporal control of developmental networks is likely a general mechanism to balance robustness of cellular states with sensitivity to signal-induced state switching.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

A.; Bornstein, A. M.", "abstract": "The ability to discriminate similar visual stimuli has been used as an important index of memory function. This ability is widely thought to be supported by expanding the dimensionality of relevant neural codes, such that neural representations for the similar stimuli are maximally distinct, or \"separated.\" An alternative hypothesis is that discrimination is supported by lossy compression of visual inputs, efficiently coding sensory information by discarding seemingly irrelevant details. A benefit of compression, relative to expansion, is that it allows the individual to efficiently retain fewer essential dimensions underlying stimulus variation---a process linked to higher-order visual processing---without hindering discrimination. Under the compression hypothesis, pattern separation is facilitated when more information from similar stimuli can be discarded, rather than preserving more information about distinct stimulus dimensions. We test the compression versus expansion hypotheses by predicting performance on the canonical mnemonic similarity task. First, we train neural networks to compress perceptual and semantic factors of stimuli, and measure lossiness of those representations using the mathematical framework underlying compression. Consistent with the compression hypothesis, and not the expansion hypothesis, we find that greater lossiness predicts the ease and performance of lure discrimination, particularly in later layers of convolutional neural networks shown to predict brain activity in the higher-order visual stream. We then empirically confirm these predictions across two sets of images, four behavioral datasets, and alternative metrics of lossiness. Finally, using task fMRI data, we identify signatures of lossy compression---neural dimensionality reduction and information loss---in the higher-order visual stream regions V4 and IT as well as hippocampal subregions dentate gyrus/CA3 and CA1 associated with lure discrimination performance. These results suggest lossy compression may support mnemonic discrimination behavior by discarding redundant and overlapping information.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Turecki, G.; Bazinet, R.; Mechawar, N.", "abstract": "The uncinate fasciculus (UF) is a long-range association fiber tract that serves to connect the anterior temporal lobe with the orbitofrontal cortex. The UF has been implicated via neuroimaging studies in the neurobiological vulnerability to psychiatric disorders posed by a history of childhood abuse (CA), as well as in the psychopathology underlying depressive disorders. Since the myelin sheath is highly enriched in lipids, white matter (WM) dysfunction may reflect alterations in the myelin lipid profile. In fact, our previous work showed that in the anterior cingulate cortex WM, there was a specific effect of CA in the choline glycerophospholipid fatty acids (FA) involved in the synthesis of arachidonic acid. Given that the UF does not exist in rodents, its molecular properties are highly understudied and its lipid composition is virtually unknown. As such, we sought to quantify the phospholipid FA and cholesterol quantities of the human postmortem UF and measure whether we could detect lipid-related or myelin-constituent gene/protein changes associated with CA and/or depression. Fresh-frozen left hemisphere UF samples were analyzed from individuals with depression who died by suicide with a history of severe CA (DS-CA), individuals with depression who died by suicide without a history of CA (DS), and non-psychiatric control subjects who died naturally or accidentally (CTRL). Phospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography. FA and non-derivatized cholesterol were quantified using gas chromatography-flame ionization detection. Relative expression of myelin-constituent genes (PLP1, MAG, CNP, MOG, PLLP, MBP, and MOBP) was measured by RT-qPCR, and levels of myelin-constituent proteins (MAG, MOG, MBP, and PLP) were measured by immunoblotting. We found no robust relationships between depression or CA and any lipid measures, nor in myelin-constituent gene and protein levels. However, in the phospholipids, we observed striking age relationships that varied across fractions, with an overall pattern of increases in monounsaturates and decreases in long chain omega-6 polyunsaturates with age. In tandem, we observed that most myelin-constituent genes and proteins showed decreasing trends with age, with PLP1 and MAG showing significantly decreasing relationships. We hypothesize that the changes in lipid composition and lipid-protein interactions contribute to age-related myelin deficits and declines in cognition.

Poor theoretical and experimental control of variables that drive metaphor activation (particularly the constructs of novelty and familiarity) may be the reason for past discrepancies between studies. To address this issue, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and a carefully designed paradigm modified from Cardillo et al. (2012) to investigate how neural activation varies by sentence type (metaphorical versus literal sentences) and novelty (completely novel versus familiarized phrases). Activity was significantly greater for metaphorical over literal sentences in the left inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis (LIFGtri), left inferior parietal cortex, right IFG, pars opercularis (RIFGop), and right angular gyrus (RAG). Novel metaphors to which participants had no prior exposure had significantly higher (albeit weak) effects within RIFGop, RAG, and right middle temporal gyrus (RMTG) compared to novel metaphors to which participants were exposed just prior to the fNIRS experiment. Pre-exposed, more familiar metaphors significantly activated a wider network of regions compared to novel metaphors, including bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral IFGtri, and LMTG. A greater response time difference between conditions was associated with less LMFG activity for metaphors over literal sentences but higher LMTG activity for novel over more familiar metaphors. Taken together, these findings suggest that metaphors - particularly novel metaphors - do engage right hemisphere cortex more than other phrase types (literal sentences, more familiar metaphors) but that the effects are weaker than condition differences within canonical left language network and domain-general multiple demand network regions.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Moreover, it is the leading predictor of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and suicidal behavior. Despite the robust link between CA and psychopathology, individual outcomes vary significantly, with some children demonstrating resilience. Resilience is an adaptive and dynamic process, which mitigates the long-term effects of CA, suggesting potential protective mechanisms that remain underexplored. This study investigates the role of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system, a critical modulator of stress, cognition, and emotion, in mediating resilience and susceptibility following early life stress (ELS). Methods: Using a maternal deprivation model combined with limited nesting and bedding, we examined behavioral, physiological, and neurobiological markers associated with ELS outcomes in mice of both sex. Results: Behavioral clustering revealed distinct phenotypes: resilient, anxious, and depressive-like with sex-specific differences in distribution. Early markers, including body weight and ultrasonic vocalization (USV) patterns, predicted long-term susceptibility. Neuroanatomical analyses identified sex-specific LC-NE activation patterns associated with resilience and susceptibility, highlighting the caudal-dorsal LC as a critical region in males and females in different phenotypes, anxious in males and resilient in females.

ApoE2-expressing mice show reparative corticospinal and raphespinal axon growth with greater motor function than controls after spinal cord injury. Distinct from ApoE in other settings, there is no change in inflammation or scarring. After axotomy, ApoE exerts allele-specific effects on LRP8 localization and signaling in cortical neurons. APOE alleles regulate synaptic organization gene expression by cortical neurons after injury, with little effect on glial gene expression.

In plants, nucleic acid degradation during PCD facilitates the redistribution of their constituent building blocks. Previous studies have shown that nucleases from the S1/P1 family are involved in this process; however, due to its complexity, it has been hypothesized that nucleases from other families, including staphylococcal-like nucleases (SNc), may also participate. In Arabidopsis, this family comprises two nucleases with an atypical plasma membrane localization for this type of enzymes: AtCAN1 and AtCAN2. Results Using the promoter-driven GUS reporter assay, we showed that the genes encoding SNc nucleases are expressed in tissues that can be grouped into three main categories. The first category includes plant structures that are clear examples of organs undergoing PCD, such as the root cap, vascular bundle elements, the tapetum, maturing seed pods, and senescent leaves. The second category comprises cells whose function involves interaction with the external environment and which are susceptible to pathogen attack. This group includes root hairs, stomatal guard cells, and hydathodes. The third group of plant structures showing SNc nuclease activity consists of elements characterized by endoreduplication, i.e., stipules, trichomes, and the basal parts of the hypocotyl. Conclusions Our studies show that SNc nucleases are as broadly involved in the DNA degradation during plant PCD as the previously reported S1/P1 proteins. The frequent overlap in their expression profiles suggests cooperative action. Whereas SNc nucleases localize to the plasma membrane, S1/P1 nucleases are nuclear, indicating distinct yet complementary nucleolytic pathways. We further demonstrate that SNc nucleases are specifically expressed in organs not undergoing PCD but characterized by endoreduplication, implicating them in an unexplored mechanism for redistributing polyploid DNA components.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Across a wide variety of motor behaviors, individuals with cerebellar damage show impairments in these corrections, strongly suggesting a key role of the cerebellum in sensorimotor adaptation. However, the extent to which the cerebellum is involved in controlling vocal pitch is currently unknown. Crucially, vocal pitch differs in several ways from other systems that suggest it relies more on feedback than feedforward control. Adaptation itself also differs in vocal pitch: rather than the gradual build-up/decay of learning seen in other systems, pitch adaptation and de-adaptation are almost immediate. Together, this questions whether adaptation in vocal pitch relies on the same mechanism as other motor domains. Here, we test the hypothesis that the cerebellum underlies sensorimotor adaptation in vocal pitch, testing the domain-generality of this neurocomputational process. In both sustained vocalization and a more natural word production task, individuals with cerebellar ataxia fail to adapt to external auditory perturbation of vocal pitch. The complete lack of adaptation observed, compared to the impaired but present adaptation seen in other systems, suggest that the cerebellum plays an especially critical role in maintaining accurate control of vocal pitch. Conversely, we failed to detect a previously observed increase in online compensation to vocal pitch errors in ataxia, potentially suggesting this may be an idiosyncratic change in control rather than a common trait in this population.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Lipid metabolism is indispensable for this parasite's replication and survival, yet most of the molecular components and mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. In eukaryotes, lipid droplets (LDs) serve as dynamic organelles that store neutral lipids (NLs), buffer lipotoxic stress, and regulate signaling pathways, with their biogenesis controlled by diacylglycerol o-acyltransferases (DGATs). Although P. falciparum encodes a putative DGAT, its role in the parasite life cycle has not been elucidated. We generated conditional PfDGAT-knockout parasites to investigate the enzyme's functional significance. PfDGAT deficiency led to parasite death, accompanied by reduced LD formation, elevated phospholipid levels, and induction of ER stress. Moreover, PfDGAT deletion altered protein trafficking, resulting in the decreased cytoadherence of parasite-infected erythrocytes to human brain microvascular endothelial cells, and suppressed parasite sexual differentiation. Thus, PfDGAT deletion affected multiple aspects of the parasite's life cycle, highlighting its critical role in parasite survival and pathogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into parasite lipid homeostasis and highlight DGAT as a potential target of antimalarial intervention.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Through target prediction and multi-database mining, we identified 57 common targets of UA and OM. ML algorithms, including Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and random forest, pinpointed three core genes: Neutrophil Elastase (ELANE), Lactoferrin (LTF), and S100A12.

Molecular docking and dynamics simulations confirmed stable binding between UA and ELANE. In vitro, UA exhibited antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates (MIC = 16-64 g/mL) and showed synergistic effects with Penicillin (FICI = 0.125-0.5). These results demonstrate that UA combats OM through immunomodulation, anti-inflammatory actions, and direct antibacterial activity, providing a foundation for its use as an adjuvant therapy against MRSA-related OM.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Each program contained a set of steps linked to operations, the implications of which had to be computed. We found that behavioral performance scaled with program complexity, and by the end of execution, inferred program solutions were represented in prefrontal and parietal cortices. We identified a possible mechanism by which these solutions were computed. During reasoning, representations of steps in the program reactivated in fast sequences, consistent with sampling candidate partial solutions.

Here we ask how brain health relates to peripheral biomarkers of bodily health including body mass index, blood pressure, and blood biochemistry results. We use partial least squares analysis to identify generalizable patterns of covariance between multi-modal neuroimaging data (structural, functional, diffusion, and arterial spin labeling MRI), demographic, and peripheral physiological markers in two large-scale deeply phenotyped datasets: the Human Connectome Project-Aging and UK Biobank. This data-driven pattern learning approach identifies two principal axes of brain-body associations in both biological sex groups. The first axis is driven by the dominant contribution of age. Across multiple brain measures, aging is associated with loss of brain structural integrity and cerebral vascular dysfunction. The second axis is driven by metabolic features, characterized by low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated body mass index, blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin, glucose, and alanine aminotransferase, and reduced cerebral blood perfusion. Finally, we show that deviations from a healthy metabolic profile are linked to cognitive deficits, particularly in females.

Inflammaging, a state of chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation, is a key feature of aging. Macrophages, as master regulators of inflammation, are critical to this process. However, the effects of natural aging on alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lungs remain poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated AM biology in older compared with young rhesus macaques. We compared cytokine profiles in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid between young and aged macaques and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize age-related transcriptional and functional changes in AMs. Compared to young animals, AMs from aged animals exhibited similar cytokine inflammaging profile observed in the plasma of elderly humans. However, the general decrease of chemokine levels in BAL fluid relative to plasma suggest BAL may not reflect AM status in the lung tissues of rhesus macaques. scRNA-seq data corroborated plasma inflammaging findings, revealing increased inflammatory cytokine responses in AMs from older macaques. The consistent elevation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) across plasma, AMs, and BAL fluid marks it as a promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target for age-associated inflammation. scRNA-seq further identified genes and pathways linked to macrophage senescence and turnover, suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Overall, our findings highlight the essential role of tissue-resident macrophages in pulmonary aging and underscores the need to further investigate their role in age-associated lung disease.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

As EVs play an important role in intercellular signaling, these have emerged as promising biomarkers for many diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. A major bottleneck in research into EVs and their smooth translation to clinic as disease biomarkers is a lack of access to affordable and user-friendly technologies to quickly isolate EVs from complex biological and clinical samples with acceptable purity and yield. Here, we report two different designs of inertial microfluidic devices (e.g. LoAR-Exo and HiAR-Exo) that can isolate EVs from different kinds of biological samples in a single label-free step using a spiral microchannel design with different aspect ratios. LoAR-Exo has a height-to-width aspect ratio ~1, while HiAR-Exo has a height-to-width aspect ratio of 2.5, optimized by COMSOL simulations. We tested both designs by separating polystyrene particles of size < 1 micrometer from a heterogeneous mixture. We then benchmarked the performance of the microfluidic chips against ultracentrifugation and a precipitation kit by isolating EVs from the cell culture-conditioned media (CCM) of MDA-MB-231 cells. We also compared the microchip with SEC by using the CCM from H1975/OR cells. The size distribution of EVs isolated by the microfluidic chip was comparable with ultracentrifugation, precipitation and SEC.

E.; Jakubowski, J. M.; Akan, D. T.; Blackburn, E.; Garrett, M. D.", "abstract": "Background: The PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PAM) pathway is frequently dysregulated in human cancers and is a major target of therapeutic intervention, exemplified by the newly approved AKT inhibitor capivasertib. However, clinical responses are often limited by the emergence of acquired drug resistance. Methods: To uncover potential mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to capivasertib, we developed a drug-resistant ovarian cancer model (A2780 254R) through chronic exposure to the capivasertib precursor CCT129254. Results: The 254R cells exhibit broad cross-resistance to AKT inhibitors, including capivasertib, along with mTORC1 and PI3K inhibitors, in the absence of AKT mutations or elevated kinase activity. A defining feature of resistance is the reduced expression and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, a key negative regulator of cap-dependent protein synthesis (CDPS). m7GTP pull-down assays revealed impaired 4E-BP1--]eIF4E binding and persistent eIF4F complex formation, which was consistent with enhanced CDPS. An {approx}9-fold increase in CDPS activity was observed in 254R cells, without corresponding increases in global protein synthesis or the expression of canonical eIF4E targets. Strikingly, ectopic expression of wild-type or constitutively active 4E-BP1 restored capivasertib sensitivity, re-established the 4E-BP1--eIF4E interaction, and significantly reduced resistance to capivasertib. These findings identify impaired 4E-BP1 function and elevated CDPS as central mediators of acquired resistance to capivasertib. Conclusion: Overall, this work underscores the therapeutic vulnerability of the translational machinery to AKT inhibitor resistance. Targeting the eIF4F complex may offer a promising strategy to overcome acquired resistance, and the expression or phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and eIF4E may serve as predictive biomarkers to guide use of capivasertib in the clinic.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Excessive consumption of ethanol (EtOH) causes fat accumulation leading to hepatic steatosis. Hepatic thyroid hormone (TH) action or liver-specific thyromimetics, e.g. resmetirom, can reduce hepatic triglycerides. We therefore hypothesized that TH treatment could ameliorate ALD. Methods: To induce ALD, mice were treated with either EtOH or liquid control diet for 10 days followed by a single EtOH or maltose control gavage on day 11. The liquid diets were supplemented with solvent, T3 or Resmetirom. We studied WT and hepatocyte-specific TR{beta} KO mice (hepTR{beta}KO). Effects were measured by clinical chemistry, liver staining, hepatic triglyceride content, and RNA-sequencing. Results: Surprisingly, resmetirom had no beneficial effect and T3 treatment even aggravated EtOH-induced steatosis (increased liver weight and hepatic triglycerides). The liver phenotype was worsened in hepTR{beta}KO mice, which still suggested beneficial effects of hepatic TR{beta} signaling in WT mice. These seemingly paradoxical results could be explained by extrahepatic effects in WAT: WAT weight and adipocyte size were reduced by EtOH, T3 and resmetirom. These data indicate lipolysis and subsequent fatty acid accumulation in the liver, explaining the more severe ALD phenotype with T3 and attenuated effect of resmetirom. As WAT loss was reduced in hepTR{beta}KO mice, the hepatic TR{beta} mediated the extrahepatic effects of T3 and resmetirom on WAT. Conclusion: We conclude that extrahepatic TH effects in WAT were detrimental in ALD and counteracted beneficial local hepatic TH/TR{beta} action. As WAT loss appeared to originate from the hepatic TR{beta}, this also applied to resmetirom.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Existing methods to reconstruct these networks typically rely either on TF motifs in CREs or gene expression data alone, limiting their accuracy. Motif data alone often fail to identify actual TF binding sites, while expression data cannot distinguish direct from indirect regulatory relationships. Additionally, accurate TF networks must be tissue-specific due to varied TF activities and expression patterns across tissues. We introduce METANets (Motif Expression TF Association Networks), a novel supervised ensemble learning approach integrating TF motifs, TF binding locations, CRE activity, and gene expression data. Using XGBoost models, we predict TF binding in CREs based on TF motif and gene expression features, derived from linear (LASSO) and non-linear (BART) regression models trained on tissue-specific and aggregated RNA-seq data. This approach was applied to 36 human tissues from GTEx. METANets significantly outperform existing motif-only and expression-only approaches, capturing more direct, functional TF targets. Evaluations against ChIP-seq binding data and gene ontology enrichment demonstrate METANets' superiority in identifying functional targets directly bound by TFs. Furthermore, tissue specificity assessed through tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) confirms METANets effectively capture tissue-specific regulation, performing comparably with other networks. Our approach markedly improves TF network reconstruction by combining complementary data types, enhancing the accuracy and utility of tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory maps. METANets provide robust resources for researchers investigating TF-mediated regulation within human tissues.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

They exhibit dynamic functional and structural changes that enable the brain to learn, adapt, and form memories. Recent advances in endogenous protein fluorescent labeling offer an opportunity to image synaptic strength in vivo and thus study the mechanisms underlying adaptive neural computation in living mice. Studying synaptic dynamics requires tracking individual signals of small, densely packed synapses over days while they change in size, position, and intensity between imaging sessions, and may even appear/disappear entirely. Tracking >100,000 dynamic, submicrometer particles is difficult even for state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, most algorithms rely on an isotropic uncertainty ball, assigning equal weight to the lateral plane (XY) and to the noisier axial dimension (Z), leading to poorer performance. To address these challenges and accurately track synapses in vivo, we developed SynTrack. We formulated SynTrack as a Maximum A Posteriori estimation problem under the anisotropic uncertainty ball, along with a fully temporally connected spatio-temporal graph to overcome long-term occlusions. SynTrack achieves a mean track length of 0.51 um with a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) score of 88.8%, on par with MOTA scores of expert annotators but with massively increased speed and scalability. Over two weeks, we successfully track 65,000 synapses in 5.6 out of 8 imaging sessions on average, with 20,000 synapses being tracked in at least seven sessions.

The impairment of consciousness associated with a spike-wave discharge can be variable: some people maintain responsiveness during some absence seizures, and some rodent oscillations resembling spike-wave discharges may not have any behavioral impact. We previously observed that spike-wave discharges in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg model sometimes terminated shortly after presentation of a conditioned auditory stimulus.

Current disease models propose AMD pathogenesis is a consequence of cytolytic damage and tissue inflammation that result from defective repression of alternative complement pathway activity by complement factor H (CFH). However, recent studies demonstrate functions for CFH that are outside of its established role in the alternative complement pathway, suggesting that novel CFH-mediated mechanisms may influence AMD initiation and progression. Our previous demonstration that CFH and its nematode homolog, CFH-1, modulate inversin/NPHP-2 accumulation in vertebrate photoreceptor and C. elegans sensory neuron cilia during aging suggests that AMD patients with CFH loss-of-function mutations have cilia defects that may contribute to photoreceptor dysfunction. Here, we investigate the consequences of CFH and CFH-1 loss-of-function mutations on the dynamics and localization of intraflagellar transport (IFT) train and visual cycle components in these cells. In C. elegans sensory neurons, IFTB1 components IFT52/OSM-6 and IFT88/OSM-5 are transported at similar rates in WT animals but IFT52/OSM-6 transport slows significantly in cfh-1 mutant animals while IFT88/OSM-5 is unaffected. Defective localization of IFT52/OSM-6 in photoreceptors of CFH knockout mice and in human photoreceptors from AMD high-risk CFH Y402H homozygotes, suggest an evolutionarily conserved role for CFH in promoting IFT52/OSM-6 transport and localization in sensory neuron cilia. In addition, distribution of CNG channel subunits in C. elegans cfh-1 mutant sensory neurons and CFH Y402H high-risk human photoreceptors are distinct from their WT and Y402 low-risk counterparts.

Here, we assessed patterns of elevational replacement in haemosporidian parasite assemblages that infect three congeneric songbird species: Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii), Gray Vireo (V. vicinior), and Plumbeous Vireo (V. plumbeus), each of which breeds across distinct elevations and habitats in the southwestern United States. We screened a total of 248 individuals using cytochrome b PCR and microscopy. We identified 19 haemosporidian haplotypes, including eight novel lineages. We found that each of the three vireo species exhibited high haemosporidian prevalence (55.0 to 86.2%), with nearly all infections from the genus Haemoproteus (subgenus Parahaemoproteus). Haemosporidian assemblages varied across elevations; each sampled range of elevations harbored abundant, yet host-specific lineages with different environmental associations. Bell's and Plumbeous Vireos, but not Gray Vireos, hosted several phylogenetically distinct, putative generalist lineages, likely reflecting spillover from more diverse local breeding bird communities. Repeated infections in individuals across breeding seasons, together with moderate parasitemia (mean ~1%) suggest that these focal vireo species harbor chronic infections during their respective breeding seasons.

In these regions, insect seasonality is often attributed to rainfall, yet distinct seasonal dynamics also occur in ever-wet forests where climatic fluctuations are minimal. Here, we examine the seasonality of abundance and diversity in lepidopteran herbivores associated with the tropical tree genus Inga in Yasuni, an aseasonal lowland rainforest in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We find that both leaf production and herbivore communities show pronounced seasonal peaks during the driest and brightest months of the year. Using structural equation modeling, we evaluate the relative roles of climate and leaf production in shaping insect seasonality and find support for both pathways. Finally, we show that communities feeding on expanding versus mature leaves differ strongly in composition, with expanding leaves supporting more specialized and phylogenetically divergent herbivore assemblages. Together, these results demonstrate that even in an ever-wet tropical forest, subtle climatic cues and host phenology interact to drive pronounced insect seasonality", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

This revealed that 16% of somatic variants occur in sequences absent from GRCh38, with satellite repeats acting as hotspots for UV-induced damage due to sequence-intrinsic mutability and inefficient repair. Centromere kinetochore domains emerged as focal sites of structural, genetic, and epigenetic variation, leading to remodeling of centromere kinetochore binding domains during tumor evolution.

Such plasticity is particularly critical in neurons, stem cells, cancer cells, and immune cells, where biosynthetic demands can shift rapidly. However, current metabolic imaging techniques using isotope labeling typically track only one metabolite at a time, limiting their ability to capture the rapid dynamics of complex metabolic networks including coordinated precursor utilization, crosstalk, and turnover. Here, we present Subcellular Multiplexed Metabolic Isotope Tracing Stimulated Raman Scattering microscopy (SuMMIT-SRS), a platform that enables simultaneous visualization of multiple metabolic dynamics at subcellular resolution. By exploiting the distinct vibrational signatures of carbon-deuterium bonds derived from multiple deuterated amino acids, lipids, and monosaccharide tracers, SuMMIT-SRS maps co-regulated DNA, RNA, protein, and lipid synthesis at the same time and resolves various individual amino acid-mediated metabolic pathways within intact cells and tissues. We demonstrate SuMMIT's broad utility across Drosophila fat body tissue and developing brain, tumor organoids, aged human neurons, and mouse liver, capturing cell type-specific metabolic rewiring under genetic and pathological perturbations.

Because these approaches require high-resolution optics, the Nyquist-Shannon determined voxel size is small relative to typical tissue sample footprints. A common solution to speed up both experiments and computation is to increase the distance in between focal planes, trading off local information content to sample a larger imaging area in a reasonable time. In this work we introduce a GPU-accelerated computational framework, merfish3d-analysis, designed to speed up the computational processing of barcoded, in situ imaging-based spatial transcriptomics. Using this framework, we quantify the information lost due to axial sampling changes in simulated imaging-based spatial transcriptomic experiments, robustly reprocess publicly available multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) datasets, and analyze new MERFISH experiments performed on a post-mortem human olfactory bulb sample. To improve the quality of experimental data in the post-mortem human sample, we designed a multi-step autofluorescence quenching protocol specific for in situ imaging-based spatial transcriptomic strategies.

However, accurate strain-level analysis remains challenging due to limited linkage information, ambiguous read mapping, and complicating factors such as genome similarity, sequencing depth, and community complexity. These challenges are especially pronounced for short-read metagenomic data when estimating the relative abundances of multiple strains - a task critical for genotype-phenotype association studies. Results: To address this gap, we present Strainify, which enables accurate strain-level abundance estimation from short-read metagenomes with as little as 1% genome coverage. Specifically, Strainify combines (1) identification of informative variants via core genome alignment, (2) filtering of confounding variants via a window-based test, and (3) maximum likelihood estimation of strain abundances. A Shannon entropy-weighted version of the model further improves robustness in noisy, low-coverage settings by downweighting sites with low information content. Across simulated communities of varying complexity, Strainify consistently outperformed existing approaches. On mock community sequencing data, Strainify's estimates aligned more closely with reference abundances. When applied to a longitudinal gut microbiome dataset, Strainify successfully recapitulated the reported temporal dynamics of Bacteroides ovatus strain groups, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically meaningful patterns from real-world metagenomes. Together, these results establish Strainify as a robust and versatile solution for accurate strain-level abundance estimation in short-read, low-coverage microbiome studies.

This capability provides a quantitative window into increasingly broad regions of the vast combinatorial fitness landscape---well beyond those explored by natural evolution. While identifying a few engineered variants that survive under extreme selection is valuable, quantitative mapping of the fitness landscape requires accurate inference of growth rates for the entire variant population. Here, we revisit three established approaches for estimating growth rates from sequencing count data: least-squares fitting, maximum likelihood estimation, and variational Bayesian inference. In contrast to previous treatments, we introduce the softmax transformation to link the probabilistic model of counting noise to the deterministic model of variant growth. By clearly delineating these two modeling components---jointly required for inferring growth rates from time-resolved sequencing counts---we show how to replace exponential growth with any alternative model defined by a small number of variant-specific parameters. While we illustrate this flexibility using the logistic and Gompertz models of growth, application to more mechanistic models, in which growth rates are expressed in terms of microscopic biochemical parameters, will open the door to high-throughput inference of fundamental kinetic and biophysical constants from sequencing data.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

STAG2 is one of the few genes mutated in the normal urothelium of organ donors, with mutant cells undergoing positive selection. STAG2 is also a major tumour suppressor gene and its inactivation is an early event in bladder carcinogenesis. However, how STAG2, a cohesin component, regulates urothelial homeostasis remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Stag2 inactivation in normal murine urothelial cells interferes with differentiation programs, triggers transient cell cycle entry, and primes cells for clonal expansion under stress. Moreover, STAG2 loss enhances tumor formation in urothelial cells expressing mutant FGFR3 - the key oncogene in bladder cancer. We reveal that STAG2 cooperates with the DREAM transcriptional complex, a master regulator of quiescence, by binding to shared genomic sites, including cell cycle control genes. STAG2 loss alters DREAM target expression, complex composition, and chromatin distribution, and leads to rewiring of chromatin interactions involving DREAM binding motifs in genes critical for cell cycle entry.

Avocado (Persea americana), rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and phytochemicals, has shown lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties, but its integrated effects on vascular injury remain unclear. Methods Male rats were randomized into six groups (n = 4 per group): control, avocado, L-NAME, L-NAME+drugs (metoprolol+losartan), L-NAME+avocado, and L-NAME+drugs+avocado. Morphometric indices, lipid profiles, cardiac injury enzymes, and vascular biomarkers were measured after treatment. One-way ANOVA with Tukey test assessed group differences, while contour plots and correlation networks visualized biomarker interactions. Results L-NAME treatment induced a pathological phenotype characterized by reduced feed efficiency (-40%), weight gain (-80%), and BMI (-18%), together with dyslipidemia (LDL +120%, TG +55%, TC +42%, HDL -28%), myocardial stress (troponin +70%, CK +50%, LDH +35%), and vascular activation (endothelin +350%, VCAM-1 +55%, AngII +80%; all p < 0.01). Avocado supplementation mitigated these effects: BMI and feed efficiency returned to near-control levels, LDL, TG, and TC fell by 30-45%, and troponin, CK, and LDH decreased by ~25-30%.

Rectal temperature (Trec) was continuously monitored, and blood samples were collected at 0.5 {degrees}C increments up to 38.6 {degrees}C.

Understanding the driving forces behind alterations in the immune system with age has thus potential to lead to interventions against ageing in general. However, the factors driving immune ageing remain largely unknown. Here we show that alterations in response to bacterial exposure are a key driving force of immune ageing. Studying a longitudinal cohort with their immune system characterised in high-dimension, we devised a phenotype-driven gene co-regulation analysis through which we unravel the immune-ageing role for multiple cellular functions, including genes regulated by miRNAs previously reported to cause gut leakiness. Hypothesizing increased bacterial exposure as a driver of immune ageing, we quantified the exposure of each individual's immune system to bacteria through analysing the residual bacterial DNA content in their immune cells. We found that the total bacterial load is unrelated to the subject's chronological or immune age, but predicts the change in immune age over the next year. Finally, we rationalise previously observed alterations in cellular composition of the immune system associated with ageing by finding that the immune cell subtypes most increasing in their frequency are highly enriched in expressing bacterial response genes. Our results thus earmark bacterial exposure as the candidate driver to be counteracted in anti-ageing interventions and the immune cell residual bacterial DNA content as a biomarker for the immune systems most at risk of ageing.

The richness of different fungal functional guilds all increased with plant functional trait diversity but were related to different above- and below-ground plant functional traits - AMF richness was negatively associated with root traits that indicate mycorrhizal dependence, whereas diverse soil pathogens generally co-occurred with plant traits linked to faster life histories. Unexpectedly, the effect of plant diversity loss on fungal diversity did not interact with the effects of either the watering treatment or the community weighted mean of plant traits.

One such lineage is Cistantheae (Montiaceae), a morphologically diverse herbaceous clade in western North and South America. We aimed to infer a robust phylogeny of the clade as a foundation for taxonomic and comparative work. We used double-digest RADSeq to generate reduced-representation genomic data from over 160 samples representing 48 putative species in Cistantheae. Maximum likelihood and coalescent-based phylogenetic methods were utilized to infer evolutionary relationships across the full clade and within major subclades. We tested for signatures of admixture and introgressive gene flow, and reconstructed ancestral life history and climate niche to identify patterns of correlated evolution. We inferred a well-resolved phylogeny of Cistantheae, providing strong support for relationships among subclades within Cistantheae. While many species relationships were clarified, we also found evidence of rampant gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting, particularly within the annual Cistanthe clade from the Atacama Desert. Life history is evolutionarily labile across the clade, and was strongly correlated with temperature/precipitation-related bioclimatic variables: annuals tend to occur in hotter, drier environments, while perennials in cooler, wetter. Elevational range was also evolutionarily labile, with several species occupying broad elevational gradients. We present the first densely-sampled, phylogenomic analysis of Cistantheae, providing key insights into species relationships in the clade. Repeated transitions in life history and climate niche, alongside wide elevational ranges, suggest that many Cistantheae species may be preadapted to both arid and montane habitats.

In contrast to earlier studies that identified only a few highly divergent loci, our high-resolution analysis reveals widespread divergence across the genome, suggesting polygenic barriers to gene flow. Epigenetic divergence assessed using ATAC-seq, highlights population-specific differences in chromatin accessibility, which may reflect SNPs distribution or precede genetic differentiation by reshaping regulatory landscapes. We also identified new structural variants, including polymorphic indels in open chromatin, that further associate with genomic divergence. Together, these findings show that the genomic landscape of H. erato is shaped by a dynamic interplay of mutational changes, epigenetic modifications, and structural variation.

A multimodal context memory system orchestrates these capabilities, providing end-to-end support across the experimental pipeline, from high-level design objectives to fabrication protocol generation, visual defect inspection, and electrophysiological signal analysis, while maintaining human oversight at critical decision points. We demonstrate its capabilities through the development of stretchable mesh electronics for interfacing with human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), a representative application involving complex device architectures, heterogeneous material nanofabrication, and electrophysiology analysis. DeviceAgent autonomously (1) generates customized bioelectronic layouts; (2) creates comprehensive fabrication protocols tailored to specific materials and processes; (3) identifies microscopic defects using visual reasoning; and (4) analyzes cardiac electrophysiological recordings in an interpretable manner. By embedding LLMs and VLMs within a structured, tool-augmented architecture, DeviceAgent establishes a scalable and accessible paradigm for AI-scientist collaboration in nanofabrication and bioelectronics research.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

HiFAA markedly improves sensitivity while maintaining high specificity, enabling detection of binding events overlooked by existing analyses. It also ranks truly bound TFs with higher motif scores, enhancing predictive accuracy, and maintains consistently high geometric mean (G-mean) values, providing a stable balance between sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, its high-resolution footprints capture subtle structural variations, allowing precise detection of developmental stage-specific TF-binding. By uniting sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic resolution, HiFAA establishes a robust paradigm for reliable TF footprinting from ATAC-seq data.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Leter, Y. M.; Tsouri, E.; Burylo, A.; Van Heijningen, C.; Schagen, S.; de Gooijer, M. C.; Kuil, L. E.", "abstract": "Background: Microglial reactivity, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, is thought to contribute significantly to disease pathology. In experimental models, colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors transiently deplete microglia to resolve inflammation , leading to improved neuropathology. In oncology, CSF1R inhibitors modulate tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward a tumor-suppressive phenotype by silencing CSF1-CSF1R signaling. As for any therapeutic, target engagement depends on effective drug delivery. In the brain a major hurdle is the limited drug delivery caused by the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB) containing drug efflux transporters. However, the affinity to these transporters of most CSF1R inhibitors is unknown. Methods: We assessed the brain penetrance of two CSF1R inhibitors, pexidartinib (PLX3397) and sotuletinib (BLZ945), in the absence and presence of drug transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2. We further assessed their impact on peripheral immune populations, tissue-resident macrophages, microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Results: Both compounds have a limited brain permeability (brain-to-plasma ratio: 0.1). Sotuletinib was a substrate for both ABCB1 and ABCG2, whereas pexidartinib was transported primarily by ABCB1. Despite low brain exposure, both are able to ablate microglia when given to mice at high doses, accompanied by marked depletion of OPCs and macrophage populations in the liver, intestine, and kidney, as well as non-classical monocytes in blood. Pexidartinib additionally altered splenic immune composition, increasing T cells and neutrophils, and reducing dendritic cells and non-classical monocytes. Conclusion: These findings highlight that high-dose CSF1R inhibition rapidly depletes microglia, but induces substantial off-target effects. Such systemic impacts, as well as the impact on OPCs, should be considered when interpreting experimental outcomes or translating CSF1R inhibition into clinical contexts where brain targeting is required.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Avocado (Persea americana) is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, phytosterols, and antioxidants, yet its integrative impact on hypertension-induced systemic injury has not been fully explored. Methods Male Wistar rats (n = 4/group) were randomized into six groups: control, avocado, L-NAME, L-NAME+losartan+metaprolol succinate, L-NAME+avocado, and L-NAME+metaprolol succinate+avocado. Avocado pulp was incorporated into diet at 80% w/w. Endpoints included blood pressure indices, hematological parameters, liver enzymes, renal function tests, and correlation analyses of systolic-diastolic coupling. One-way ANOVA with Tukeys post hoc tests evaluated group differences, while forest plots and scatter analyses visualized treatment effects. Results L-NAME significantly elevated systolic blood pressure ({Delta}+18 mmHg), diastolic pressure ({Delta}+20 mmHg), and mean arterial pressure ({Delta}+17 mmHg; all p < 0.01) compared with controls. Avocado supplementation reduced these elevations by ~15-18 mmHg, restoring values near baseline. L-NAME increased platelet counts (p = 0.031) and trended toward leukocytosis, both of which were attenuated by avocado. ALT levels were higher in L-NAME rats (p = 0.044), while AST and ALP trended upward; avocado-fed groups maintained near-control enzyme levels. Renal markers were most affected: urea (+25 mg/dl) and creatinine (+0.8 mg/dl) rose significantly in L-NAME rats (p < 0.01), but were reduced by 20-30% with avocado supplementation. Electrolytes remained unchanged. Correlation analyses revealed pathological SBP-DBP coupling in L-NAME rats (r = 0.78), abolished by avocado (r = 0.00). Conclusion Avocado supplementation mitigates L-NAME-induced hypertension and systemic injury by stabilizing blood pressure, reducing thrombocytosis, and preserving hepatic and renal function.

Recently, two regulatory networks have been shown to exhibit tristability -- a toggle switch with self-activation, and a toggle triad. Here, we show that these two motifs are distinct from a geometrical point of view, and identify two bifurcations in their behaviour: the standard cusp and the elliptic umbillic. We study experimentally accessible signatures of the differences in tristability between the two motifs. We also show how the standard cusp can be used to quantitatively model cell fate transition data for the Epithelial to Mesenchymal transition on TGF-{beta} induction in the context of cancer cells. Our work uncovers geometrical signatures of gene regulatory motifs and demonstrates how different gene regulatory networks can encode tristability in dynamically distinct ways.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Gut microbiota-mediated recycling of urea-nitrogen into AAs has long been considered a mechanism to assist in conserving nitrogen; however, the relevance of urea nitrogen salvage (UNS) to overall host physiology and metabolism is debated. We hypothesized that incorporation of microbially-liberated urea-nitrogen (MLUN) into AAs would be higher in host tissues of hibernating arctic ground squirrels compared to those of summer active squirrels, and that MLUN would support synthesis of anabolic AAs that regulate protein balance. To test this, we injected [13C, 15N2]-urea into summer squirrels and into squirrels hibernating at an ecologically relevant ambient temperature (-16 C). We found greater incorporation of MLUN into non-essential AAs and specific essential AAs in several tissues of hibernating squirrels compared to summer. We also observed increased 15N enrichment in leucine-isoleucine, citrulline and glutamine, anabolic AAs known to influence protein balance and trans-organ nitrogen balance. Compared to studies in which ground squirrels hibernated at ambient temperatures above 0 C, our results suggest that squirrels hibernating at subzero temperatures may up modulate synthesis of AAs that preserve protein and nitrogen balance during prolonged fasting and inactivity.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

B.; Krajmalnik-Brown, R.", "abstract": "Background: Microbiota transplant therapy (MTT) is a promising avenue for the substantial improvement of gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous work has demonstrated that microbiome and metabolite profiles of children with ASD become more similar to those of their typically developing (TD) peers following MTT. Methods: To enhance a systems-level understanding of MTT in ASD children that extends beyond previously reported findings, we present a multi-omics analysis of an ASD cohort spanning 10 weeks and 2 years of follow-up after completion of MTT. We applied cutting-edge multi-omics approaches, including metagenomics, fecal and plasma metabolomics, and advanced statistical methods, including multimodal machine learning, differential network analysis, and causal mediation analysis, to extensively characterize molecular and biochemical responses before and after MTT, to identify key taxonomic, functional, and metabolite signatures associated with MTT treatment and ASD symptoms. Results: Using a combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal statistical analyses and integrative machine learning techniques, we identified key meta-omic features associated with MTT. Integrated multi-omics analysis revealed that children with ASD transition to distinct biological states following MTT, clearly separated from their pre-treatment states and from TD children, as demonstrated by robust group separation and strong classification performance. Several biological signals associated with the modulation of the gut microbiome after MTT were identified, including an increase of butyrate producers such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Butyricimonas faecalis; decreased fecal sulfated primary bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid sulfate; decreased secondary bile acid, glycolithocholate sulfate; and increased sarcosine and iminodiacetate in plasma after 10 weeks of MTT compared to baseline. Differential network analysis revealed hub species, including Prevotella copri, Ruminococcus callidus, and GGB9633 SGB15091, as differentially connected 2 years after completion of MTT compared to baseline. Mediation analysis uncovered several key players as mediators of symptoms, including Alistipes ihumii, Ruminococceae, amino acid biosynthesis, bile acids, long-chain fatty acids, and cysteine-glutathione disulfide, among others. Conclusions: This study provides one of the first comprehensive analyses of multi-omic features underlying host-microbiome interactions associated with MTT in children with ASD. It offers further evidence that fusing data across diverse molecular modalities at pre- and post-treatment time points can illuminate the potential of MTT in neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings could advance microbiome-based immunomodulatory therapies and multi-omics strategies to restore gut microbiota in children with ASD, while aiding in the discovery of novel biomarkers predictive of treatment response.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Recently we have identified a new snoRNA (jouvence) in Drosophila, and showed that its deletion (F4) reduces lifespan, while its overexpression increases it. F4 deleted flies also present neurodegenerative lesions and a deregulation of metabolic parameters as triglycerides and sterol. However, a deeper characterization of this genomic locus has revealed the presence of two other snoRNAs. Here, we have characterized at the whole organismal level, the role of each them. First, we show that each snoRNAs are expressed in the epithelium of the gut (enterocytes), and in the fat body. Second, in F4 deletion, the re-expression of each snoRNA in the enterocytes or in the fat body is sufficient to improve lifespan, and protect against neurodegeneration in old flies. In addition, depending of the snoRNAs, it rescues the expression of specific deregulated genes within the epithelium of the gut, involved in lipids and sterol metabolism. Consequently, these two metabolic parameters are also rescued, establishing a relationship between the lesions of the brain, the metabolic disorders, the lifespan, and each snoRNAs respectively. Finally, histological stainings as Nile Red and BODIPY C11-581/591 have revealed that the neurodegenerative lesions are due to an increase of free sterol within the brain, and lipid peroxydation in the pericerebral fat body. Altogether, these results point-out a causal relationship between the epithelium of the gut and the neurodegenerative lesions through the metabolic parameters, indicating a gut-brain axis.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify distinct, therapy-specific roles for the transcriptional regulator Bhlhe40 in CD4 and CD8 T cells, revealing divergent requirements during anti-PD-1 versus anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). Using conditional knockout mice, we show that anti-PD-1 efficacy depends on CD8 T cell-intrinsic Bhlhe40 and may also require its expression in CD4 T cells, whereas anti-CTLA-4 relies primarily on CD4 T cell-intrinsic Bhlhe40 and remains effective without Bhlhe40 in CD8 T cells. Loss of Bhlhe40 skews CD8 T cells toward TCF-1-expressing naive and progenitor exhausted-like states, particularly in the absence of ICT. Bhlhe40 sustains CD8 effector and exhausted phenotypes, promotes IFN{gamma} production, and supports glycolytic and mitochondrial programs, with Bhlhe40 deficiency leading to impaired glycolysis under either anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 ICT, and reduced mitochondrial function primarily during anti-PD-1. In addition, CD8 T cell-intrinsic Bhlhe40 is required for full ICT-induced remodeling of the tumor myeloid compartment from CX3CR1+; macrophages to iNOS+; macrophages. In contrast, anti-CTLA-4 can drive tumor rejection and partial macrophage remodeling in the absence of CD8 T cell-intrinsic Bhlhe40, provided CD4 T cell function is intact. Analysis of human cancer datasets revealed that BHLHE40 is enriched in tumor-reactive and activated/exhausted CD8 T cells, where its expression is inversely correlated with TCF7 (TCF-1) and positively associated with TOX and IFNG. Moreover, subsets of CD8 T cells expressed higher levels of BHLHE40 in basal and squamous cell carcinoma responders compared with non-responders. Together, these findings establish Bhlhe40 not only as a transcriptional coordinator of T cell effector programs and metabolic fitness, but also as a therapy-specific, subset-dependent determinant of ICT efficacy, providing a mechanistic basis for the divergent modes of action of anti-PD-1 versus anti-CTLA-4.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

However, little is known about the effects of the fatty acid synthesis pathway in macrophages on inflammation and cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). Using spatial metabolomics, here we show that cardiac macrophages residing in the infarct synthesize de novo fatty acids and increase the production of fatty acid enzymes including ACLY and FASN. Mice deficient in myeloid Acly and Fasn have improved cardiac function after MI and reduced fibrosis. Combining Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN), RNA sequencing analysis of Acly-/- macrophages, and macrophage-specific in vivo gene silencing, we demonstrate that ACLY acetylates the promoter region of the upstream regulator Krt17, which drives the production of pro-fibrotic cytokines, including IL-33. Single-cell RNA sequencing of cardiac fibroblasts shows that the expansion of a population of fibroblasts (Fibroblast 5) expressing high levels of extracellular matrix genes after MI is confined in the absence of macrophage Acly. Finally, the analysis of spatial multi-omics data of human hearts with MI uncovers myofibroblasts with the Fibroblast 5 gene signature. These myofibroblasts are located near cardiac macrophages expressing high levels of ACLY. In summary, we show that macrophage ACLY and FASN are deleterious in MI pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

While non-muscle myosin II (NM II) is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, whether it regulates IEC colonization by A/E pathogens is not known. To address this question, we targeted NM IIA and NM IIC, the NM II paralogs expressed in IECs. Our in vivo studies utilized mouse models with either intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of NM IIA (NM IIA cKO mice), expression of a NM IIA motor domain mutant, or total deletion of NM IIC (NM IIC tKO mice). In vitro experiments utilized IECs (HT-29cF8 and Caco-2BBE) with CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of NM IIA or NM IIC. In addition, NM II activity in vitro was modulated pharmacologically, using either the pan-myosin inhibitor, blebbistatin, or a specific NM IIC activator, 4-hydroxyacetophenone (4-HAP). NM IIA cKO and NM IIA mutant mice demonstrated higher C. rodentium colonization along with more severe mucosal inflammation and colonic crypt hyperplasia as compared to their controls. By contrast, NM IIC tKO mice was indistinguishable from their control with regard to C. rodentium colonization. Blebbistatin treatment increased EPEC attachment to IECs monolayers, whereas 4-HAP did not affect bacterial attachment. Genetic knockout of NM IIA, but not NM IIC, increased EPEC adhesion to IEC monolayers. Importantly, the increase in EPEC attachment exhibited by NM IIA-deficient IECs required intact bacterial Type 3 secretion system and functional Tir effector, indicating that NM IIA functions in actin pedestal assembly. In summary, we describe a novel role for NM IIA in limiting intestinal epithelial colonization by A/E pathogens via inhibition of pathogen-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we further show that SETDB1 modulates the TGFbeta-induced secretome, particularly by regulating ECM-related proteins. Comparison of the basal secretome from DMD patient-derived myotubes and healthy controls revealed a distinct disease-specific profile. Integrating both secretome analyses, we identified EMILIN1, an ECM glycoprotein not previously studied in skeletal muscle, as a robust shared candidate; EMILIN1 is enriched in the DMD secretome, further upregulated by TGFbeta and downregulated upon SETDB1 depletion. We confirmed EMILIN1 overexpression in DMD patient muscle biopsies, validating its pathological relevance. Functionally, EMILIN1 depletion modulated myogenic differentiation and reduced expression of the fibrotic marker SERPINE1.

Surprisingly, systematic colocalization testing with bulk-tissue eQTLs fails to link the majority of GWAS loci with gene expression changes. Mapping eQTLs with single-cell expression data has the potential to reveal the missing regulatory effects of GWAS variants. However, current pseudobulk cluster-based approaches may be underpowered when clustering accuracy is imperfect or with an incorrectly selected cluster resolution. To improve power of single-cell colocalization tests, we developed a cluster-free method, scJLIM.

We benchmarked our method with simulated data, demonstrating improvements in power over pseudobulk methods.

However, accurately identifying germline TR from standard WGS data remains challenging due to short read lengths, limited depth, and high sequence similarity. To address these challenges, we developed gAIRR-wgs, for WGS-based TR allele typing. By incorporating novel alleles from HPRC individuals, gAIRR-wgs exhibited excellent performance in allele calling, with F1 scores of 100.0% for TR_D, 99.8% for TR_J, and 98.3% for TR_V. Applying this pipeline to 1,492 individuals from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), we identified 449 novel TR alleles, 277 of which overlapped with HPRC release 1 data of mixed ethnicity and are absent in the IMGT database. Further population comparison analysis revealed significant TR allele distribution differences across global populations, showing population-specific patterns and diversity variations between ethnic groups. We also discovered TWB-specific deletion polymorphisms affecting contiguous TRGV and TRBV genes, which are not recorded in the gnomAD database and undetected by standard structural variant callers, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to resolve complex immune gene regions.

It is commonly employed to optimize specimens for cryo-EM. The stain, typically a uranyl salt, surrounds the structure, providing an outline view at about 20 [A] resolution. Many macromolecules are relatively stable and rigid, and negative stain images provide a good representation of their structure. However, some are labile or flexible and their structure or assembly state is altered by binding to the carbon substrate on the grid before specimen staining. In these cases, the negatively stained appearance does not faithfully represent the structure in solution. This problem is reduced when samples are incubated on the carbon surface for short times (5 s) rather than typical times (30-60 s) before staining. To reduce disruption to a minimum, we have developed a rapid negative staining device (QuickStainer) using 3D-printed components, a stepper motor for precisely timed movements, and an Arduino-controlled interface to execute commands. QuickStainer produces consistent, reproducible results, achieving sample incubation times as low as 10 ms before staining.

Here, we systematically investigate how variations in acyl chain length and unsaturation modulate the biophysical and electrostatic properties of zwitterionic lipid membranes. Using amphiphilic DNA nanoprobes as model charged biomolecules, we reveal how lipid packing, fluidity, and membrane phase collectively govern surface charge and interactions with nanoprobes, delineating relationships that persist in the presence of anionic lipids. We further demonstrate that the identity and hydrophobicity of membrane anchors in nanoprobes significantly influence binding, providing a means to modulate membrane association through programmable strategies.

Gene regulatory network analysis of these populations indicated activation of stem/progenitor cell regulators, including PRRX2 and CEBP{beta}. Translating these findings, a transcriptome-based drug repurposing screen identified five chemical candidates, four of which are potent Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) inhibitors, aligning with the frequent loss-of-function mutations in TP53 and CDKN2A observed in ESCC. Notably, CDK inhibitors markedly inhibit ESCC cell proliferation.

M.; Glenny, E. M.; Ho, A. N.; Dotti, G.; Hursting, S. D.; Coleman, M. F.", "abstract": "Background: We have reported that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting B7-H3 (B7-H3.CAR) are effective in a preclinical model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and have initiated a Phase I study to assess safety and efficacy. However, heterogeneous antigen expression and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) remain roadblocks for effective CAR-T cell therapy. In particular, obesity represents a negative prognostic factor in TNBC partly due to chronic inflammation and impaired adaptive immune responses. Hence, we sought to determine if obesity can affect the antitumor activity of B7-H3.CAR-T cells. Methods: We used qPCR and western blotting to determine if cytokines associated with obesity affect B7-H3 expression in TNBC cell lines. Furthermore, we used shRNA to suppress B7-H3 expression in a syngeneic orthotopic E0771 tumor model and measured tumor growth in control and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Finally, we evaluated the antitumor effects of B7-H3.CAR-T cells in both control and DIO mice orthotopically engrafted with the E0771 tumor cell line. Immune profiling was conducted using flow cytometry. Results: Obesity-related inflammatory cytokines promote B7-H3 expression in human and murine TNBC cells in vitro and B7-H3 expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness in vivo. CAR-T cells obtained from control or DIO mice were equally cytotoxic in vitro but activated T cells and B7-H3.CAR-T cells obtained from DIO mice show transcriptomic changes (enriched Tox2, Prdm1, Batf) and impaired glycolytic capacity, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that obesity impairs CAR-T cell antitumor effects and durability of response in vivo with a near complete loss of memory formation. Conclusions: Here we identified a correlation between B7-H3 expression, obesity, and rate of tumor growth in TNBC. Furthermore, we showed that obesity constrains both the ability of B7-H3.CAR-T cells to control tumor growth and to elicit durable immunological memory. Taken together, these data identify obesity as an underappreciated and potent modulator of CAR-T cell functionality.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

J.; Baker, D.; Shendure, J.", "abstract": "Although we now have a rich toolset for genome editing, an equivalent framework for manipulating the proteome with a comparable flexibility and specificity remains elusive. A promising strategy for \"proteome editing\" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector \"handles\". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,720 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity Mcl-1 binder reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

In mice, microglial depletion via CSF1R inhibition can mitigate this effect, but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that CSF1R inhibition-induced microglial ablation and repopulation improves brain health by modulating microglial reactivity to radiotherapy, which attenuates glial responses to radiotherapy. Methods: Nine-week-old male C57BL/6JRj mice received either a CSF1R-inhibitor supplemented diet (pexidartinib, PLX3397) or control diet, followed by fractionated CT-guided cRT (30 Gy) or sham treatment. The pexidartinib diet was discontinued 10 days post-radiotherapy. Animals were sacrificed at three intervals post-radiotherapy, allowing the assessment of temporal changes. Multiple brain regions were assessed by immunohistochemistry for markers of microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and proliferating cells. Microglial morphological changes were assessed using the semi-automated microglia morphology analysis pipeline mGlia. Results: Radiotherapy alone reduced microglial numbers and induced a progressive reactive morphology; mild at 30 days and pronounced at 6 months post cRT. CSF1R inhibition before cRT markedly decreased microglial markers but increased general macrophage markers at 30 days and 6 months after cRT, consistent with monocyte-derived cell engraftment. Morphometric analysis revealed rapid and severe morphological change towards a reactive morphotype at 30 days that persisted until 6 months. Microglial depletion did not prevent loss of neurogenesis or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and accelerated reactive astrogliosis, though partial OPC recovery in the hippocampus and thalamus was observed at 6 months. Conclusion: CSF1R inhibition combined with cRT accelerates reactive gliosis and monocyte-derived macrophage engraftment without protecting vulnerable neural cell populations, though limited long-term OPC recovery occurred. Thus, with this set-up CSF1R inhibition-induced microglial ablation and repopulation does not improve overall brain health, but is beneficial for OPCs on the long term after cRT.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we question this view by demonstrating cross-communication between distinct arbitrium systems. Using prototypical arbitrium phages, we demonstrate that AimP peptides bind and repress unrelated AimR receptors, promoting lysogeny and reducing prophage induction. Structural and binding assays reveal conserved residues enabling cross-recognition while preserving specificity. In mixed lysogenic cultures, these interactions shape induction outcomes, demonstrating ecological relevance. We extent these findings to infection contexts, showing that arbitrium signalling influences outcomes in cells harbouring prophages with compatible communicating systems.

In addition, the D, m1A, m7G, t6A, and i6A modifications were mapped in S. pneumoniae tRNAs, and we confirmed that a unique DusB1 enzyme is responsible for the insertion of all the detectable D modifications.

We found a strong depth and taxonomic dependency of the LDGs: while mixed layer marine microbial communities exhibited pronounced gradients with a peak in diversity at (sub)tropical latitudes (40 S to 40 N) followed by a decline toward the poles, the communities at depth (200 to 1,000 m) showed no latitudinal structuring. The LDG in the surface mixed layer was largely underpinned by species of Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteriia, while other taxa exhibited distinct or even contrasting LDGs. Diversity structuring also varied by seasons and regions, governed by temperature, nutrients, and carbon dynamics. Together, these findings highlight that within the ocean microbiome, LDGs are not universal, but rather lineage-specific outcomes of differing ecological strategies and their responses to environmental gradients.

Here, we analyzed the influence of oxygen concentrations on the microbial community in the nBUS OMZ using 16S rRNA gene (iTag) sequence data. In the nBUS oxygen was a primary driver influencing microbial community structure and diversity. Diversity was highest in dysoxic samples and lowest in suboxic samples, which was primarily due to changes in community evenness in relationship to oxygen concentrations. For example, evenness decreased in suboxic samples due to oscillations in the abundance of microbial groups such as Thioglobaceae (SUP05), which was found to be the most abundant microbe in the nBUS OMZ and significantly increased in abundance as oxygen decreased. This finding prompted an analysis of 217 publicly available medium to high quality Thioglobaceae genomes, including cultured representatives, from the nBUS and other OMZs. Genome annotation of these Thioglobaceae indicated important roles in carbon cycling, sulfur oxidation and denitrification. Importantly, few Thioglobaceae possess the genetic potential to carry out complete denitrification, as most lack the gene that codes for nitrous oxide reductase (NosZ), which converts nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, to nitrogen gas.

In the case of Leishmania spp., it is generally assumed that the parasite must be phagocytosed to further establish residence within professional phagocytic cells. However, several studies report the presence of Leishmania spp. in non-phagocytic cells, highlighting their ability to enter cells independently of classical phagocytosis. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that promastigotes, the infective form transmitted to hosts during the bite of the insect vector, subvert a lysosome-exocytosis-dependent membrane repair pathway to invade fibroblasts. Here, we investigate the invasion of non-phagocytic cells by L. amazonensis amastigotes, the infective form directly responsible for host-to-vector transmission, disease generation and parasite dissemination during infection in humans and other mammalian hosts. Our results show that amastigotes rapidly induce their entry into cells lacking classical phagocytic capability, where they survive, multiply, and persist. Invasion depends on parasite-induced actin remodeling confined to the parasite-host plasma membrane contact site, with localized recruitment of Rho GTPases that fuel actin polymerization at invasion foci. Our findings highlight the remarkable ability of Leishmania amastigotes to induce their own internalization into virtually any cell type, bypassing the need for conventional phagocytosis. This property may profoundly influence parasite biology by enabling amastigotes to cross cellular barriers, disseminate, and silently establish infection in diverse host cells. Importantly, when considering non-phagocytic cells, our results demonstrate that Leishmania amazonensis employs distinct, stage-specific invasion mechanisms: promastigotes co-opt host cell lysosomes, whereas amastigotes depend on F-actin dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Such reproductive transitions have independently evolved across diverse taxa, underscoring the advantage of prioritising current over future reproduction. In vertebrates, the behavioural sequence separating reproduction from parental care is controlled by offspring-derived cues. While many insects display obligate parental care, the role of brood cues in regulating adult reproduction remains unresolved outside advanced eusocial taxa, where reproductive plasticity has largely been lost. Here, we investigate reversible reproductive transitions in the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi, in which totipotent adults synchronously alternate between brood care and egg laying under larval regulation. Using custom behavioural assays, we show that larvae inhibit adult reproduction without physical contact, implicating volatile cues. Chemical analyses identified a previously undescribed larval-specific compound, methyl 3-ethyl-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoate (MEHMP), which is absent from other brood stages and ant species. Production of the compound closely tracked larval development and colony cycles, linking its abundance to reproductive synchrony. Exposure to synthetic MEHMP recapitulated the inhibitory effect of larval volatiles, confirming its role as a pheromone that suppresses adult egg laying.

Recently, we reported a biocompatible method for engaging photo-induced electron transfer to drive protein labelling using biaryl pyridinium salts and, here, we report the design of a series of aromatic cation salts that trigger this process using longer wavelengths of light while maintaining a sterically minimal profile. We achieved this through the systematic study of structure-reactivity relationships of various donor-acceptor pyridinium salts possessing extended conjugation, and these studies revealed the need of a constrained trans-stilbene relationship between the probes donor and acceptor substituents in order to achieve protein labelling. Probes with chromene-based donor groups in particular showed either robust protein labelling, significant fluorescence quantum yields, or state-dependent photophysical properties; in turn enabling the same probes to be used for both photo-induced protein labelling and wash-free live-cell imaging. We also demonstrate that these enhanced probes possess robust reactivity in complex biological environments through green light-triggered intracellular labelling in live HeLa cells, resulting in the identification of 659 enriched proteins. This series of experiments not only demonstrates the ability of this latest generation of probes to engage in photo-induced labelling using lower energy light in complex proteomes, but also reveals new capabilities for photophysical state-dependent reactivity and measurements.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the potential of de novo designed synthetic ligands, termed Novokines, to reprogram cell identity by inducing proximity of novel pairs of receptor subunits. We find that a design, H2F, that brings together HER2 (which has no known natural ligand) and the FGF receptor has potent signaling activity. H2F induces robust signaling and reprograms fibroblasts into myogenic cells. Unlike native FGF ligands, H2F selectively activates the MAPK pathway without engaging PLCgamma-mediated Ca+2 signaling. FRET assays confirm H2F-mediated HER2-FGFR proximity, and phosphoproteomic analysis reveals activation of MAPK effectors. H2F-induced ERK phosphorylation is abolished in cells expressing a kinase-dead FGFR1(K514M) mutant, confirming the requirement for FGFR catalytic activity.

Accordingly, many cancer cell lines are vulnerable to METTL1 loss, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. We identify a subset of cell lines insensitive to METTL1 depletion and use oesophageal lines as a model to explore the mechanism. The METTL1-resistant adenocarcinoma line OE33 preserves tRNA balance upon m7G46 deficiency by elevating dihydrouridylation at position 47 (D47). Depletion of DUS-L enzymes that catalyse D16/D17/D20/D47 on tRNAs sensitises OE33 to METTL1 loss. Concomitant loss of dihydrouridylation and m7G46 destabilizes the canonical L-shaped tRNA structure, disrupts coaxial helix stacking and anticodon-loop presentation, and reduces cellular fitness. Notably, METTL1-sensitive cell lines lack this compensatory pathway due to the deleterious effects of increasing their intrinsically low DUS3L levels. These findings reveal a DUS-L-mediated buffering mechanism that supports tRNA homeostasis in METTL1-resistant cancers and highlight DUS3L abundance as a potential biomarker for predicting METTL1 sensitivity. Moreover, they suggest that combined targeting of DUS-L and METTL1 may provide a therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance in cancers, exemplified in cell lines such as OE33.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Despite the physiological relevance and cost-effectiveness of organ chips, there are several hurdles that must be overcome for widespread adoption for biological studies. Many shortcomings of manufacturing and scalability have been overcome by a transition from PDMS to thermoplastics. However, challenges have arisen in these sealed, brittle systems related to end-point tissue analyses, harvest, and high-resolution imaging, which is particularly difficult for multi-layer organ chips. Here, we present low-cost organ chips that are fluidically sealed but demountable, fabricated using a cut-and-assemble method without the need for cleanroom technologies. We have validated the capabilities of this method by demonstrating the culture of human aortic smooth muscle cells and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cells, encapsulated in gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel on chip, for up to 27 days. The 3D culture layer of the organ chip was removed, and high-resolution images were obtained via immunostaining. Furthermore, these organ chips facilitate rapid redesign and manufacture for alternative tissue and/or interface systems. To our knowledge, this is the first innervated organ chip with multiple removable cell culture layers, as well as the first humanized nerve-artery model that includes a three-dimensional hydrogel culture.

Methods: The model incorporated detailed representations of bones, soft tissues, ligaments, and the plantar aponeurosis, and was driven by experimentally measured tibial kinematics and estimated muscle forces. Results: Simulation results reasonably matched experimental data on ground reaction forces, plantar pressure distributions, and bone movements, confirming the model's ability to replicate key aspects of foot-ground interactions during walking. Moreover, the model enabled the estimation of internal forces, stresses, and strains in foot structures that are not directly measurable in vivo, offering new insights into the biomechanics underlying foot pathologies.

Benchmarking analyses confirmed that PreCSenM markedly outperforms existing methodologies in reliably predicting senescent states within both normal and cancerous transcriptomic datasets. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PreCSenM identified the CS score as a robust predictor of clinical outcomes. Multi-omics analyses further revealed that lower CS levels correlate with decreased genomic stability and enhanced immune responses, aligning with clinical observations. Notably, drug discovery using PreCSenM identified histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) as potent inducers of CS in LUAD. Transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of HDACi-treated cells pinpointed FOSB as a core transcription factor driving CS, and FOSB knockdown blocked HDACi-induced senescence.

The purpose of this study was to infer the molecular regulatory network governing RPS6KB1 expression. We applied a novel bioinformatic network inference algorithm called CARNIVAL (CAusal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming) to infer the signaling network downstream of canonical exercise sensors controlling RPS6KB1-specific transcription factors (TFs) after acute aerobic (AE) or resistance exercise (RE). CARNIVAL integrates a prior knowledge network, TF and signaling pathway activities inferred from transcriptomic data, and perturbation targets to predict the network that best explains the data. The networks revealed intracellular sensors and hormone receptors controlling RPS6KB1-specific TFs. Both exercise types resulted in AMPK-mediated SNAI1 regulation, but HIF1A was distinctly controlled (AE: PHD1-3, FIH; RE: AMPK). AE controlled FOXA1 via insulin, TGF-{beta}, and myostatin signalling, while RE controlled CEBPA via MAP3Ks. Our study is the first to apply a comprehensive bioinformatic network inference algorithm to infer causal exercise-responsive signaling networks. The results of our analysis motivate experimentally testable hypotheses pertaining to the molecular control of RPS6KB1 transcription in human skeletal muscle in response to aerobic and resistance exercise.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

We introduce CoxMDS, a multiple data splitting method that uses Cox proportional hazards models to identify putative causal mediators for survival outcomes. CoxMDS ensures finite-sample FDR control even in the presence of correlated or non-Gaussian mediators. Through simulations, CoxMDS is shown to maintain FDR control and achieve higher statistical power compared with existing approaches. In applications to DNA methylation data with survival outcomes, CoxMDS identified eight CpG sites in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA methylation may mediate the effect of smoking on lung cancer survival, and two CpG sites in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) that are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA methylation may mediate the effect of smoking on time to Alzheimer's disease conversion.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

However, long-term treatment of adult fish with small molecule BRAF inhibitors is challenging, limiting the usefulness of this model to study treatment-induced effects in melanoma biology. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies on small molecule inhibitors in zebrafish that could inform rational dosing strategies, are largely lacking. Here, we have assessed the pharmacokinetics, metabolism and efficacy of continuous tank water -administered BRAF-inhibitor dabrafenib in adult zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that dabrafenib is quickly absorbed from the tank water, reaching efficacious plasma levels within one hour following treatment, but also shows fast elimination kinetics with a half-life of 1.6 hours. We could detect most of the human metabolites of dabrafenib in zebrafish, suggesting that dabrafenib metabolism in zebrafish follows a similar process as in humans. Continuous tank water -administered dabrafenib led to therapeutically relevant steady-state plasma levels that inhibited the BRAF-driven signaling and growth in zebrafish melanoma cells in vitro, and resulted in robust in vivo efficacy in a genetic zebrafish model of BRAF-mutant melanoma, with no apparent toxicity. Together, our results demonstrate that continuous tank water -administered dabrafenib provides a feasible, efficient, and well-tolerated dosing strategy to study treatment-related effects in zebrafish models of BRAF-mutant melanoma.

We observed that when compared to mature leaves, young, expanding leaves do not close their plasmodesmata, have a reduced transcriptional response to immune elicitors, and are more susceptible to a bacterial pathogen. Disconnecting leaf age from physiology, we determined that both plasmodesmal closure and the magnitude of transcriptional responses are dependent on whether the leaf is a carbon sink or a carbon source. To probe the relevance of differential regulation of plasmodesmata in sink and source tissues, we forced plasmodesmal closure in young sink leaves and found this perturbed the normal outputs of growth and defence. Thus, we propose that sink leaves do not close their plasmodesmata during immune reponses to prioritise carbon use for growth over defence, and consequently that primary metabolism underpins different immune response profiles in different leaves of the same plant.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Neuromodulation plays a central role in this flexibility, dynamically tuning neuronal activity and gene expression to align behavior with experience and internal states. Yet how specific experiences and motivational conditions are encoded within neuromodulatory neurons remains underexplored. Here, we show that distinct motivational outcomes drive discrete, largely non-overlapping transcriptional programs across three neuromodulatory neuronal populations in male Drosophila brains. Using cell-type-resolved RNA sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of serotonergic (Trh), octopaminergic/tyraminergic (Tdc2), and neuropeptide F receptor (NPFR) neurons under three conditions: successful mating, sexual rejection, and the absence of social or sexual interaction. Each experience induced a unique molecular engram within specific neuron types. NPFR neurons exhibited the strongest transcriptional remodeling following rejection, Tdc2 neurons preferentially represented the single state, and Trh neurons displayed balanced, experience-specific tuning. Shared differentially expressed genes across neuronal classes were few and often were oppositely regulated, revealing divergent circuit-specific logic. Experience triggered multilayered reprogramming across chromatin organization, RNA metabolism, translation, proteostasis and synaptic machinery, with selective recalibration of vesicle trafficking, and neuroplasticity. We further identified a compact, cross-circuit rejection core enriched for circadian, stress, metabolic, neuropeptidergic, and synaptic components.

Previously published mathematical model-based simulations of randomly searching for an infection T cells, assuming that T cells move in open (3D) space or on a regular lattice, suggested that some degree of attraction is needed for cells to find the infection. Yet, in our previous experiments we failed to find evidence of attraction towards the infection in most T cells. Because the movement of liver-localized T cells is confined to sinusoids, the blood vessels of the liver, T cells may in fact be attracted to the infection site via the sinusoids. In new experiments we imaged Plasmodium-specific CD8 T cells, sporozoites, and liver sinusoids simultaneously. We also developed a new method to model imaged sinusoids as graphs and to simulate movement of T cells on graphs, and new tests to detect biased cell movement on graphs. As before, our previously published open space/3D-based metric suggested that few T cells are attracted to the infection site in presence of moderate cluster of T cells. However, with our new graph-based metric we could not detect attraction when constraining T cell movement to sinusoids. Surprisingly, simulations of T cells searching for an infection via liver sinusoids showed that a relatively small number of T cells (1 cell/imaging volume or <10^5 cell/liver), moving without attraction at experimentally observed speeds, is sufficient to find the infection within 24 hours, well below the expected lifespan of the Plasmodium liver stage in mice. Our results suggest that the constrained environment of the tissue structure makes a random search more effective, and that detecting T cell attraction towards specific areas may arise as an artifact of metrics designed for open space/3D. Our results thus call for a re-evaluation of the implicit assumption that attraction is necessary for T cells to find infections in tissues.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

The reasons for this disparity are not fully understood. Given the role of the gut microbiome in immune development, we investigated the relationship between the gut microbiome and polio vaccine seroconversion in children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Methods: This cross-sectional analysis included children ages 6-24 months old (n=90) enrolled in the DRC. Vaccine history was obtained from health records and/or self-report and poliovirus serostatus surveyed using dried blood spots. Nutritional status was evaluated using anthropomorphic measures. Microbiome profiling (16S rRNA gene) was performed and associations with poliovirus serostatus and malnutrition were examined. Results: The average age of the study population was 13.6 months (SD=5.6) with 58% female. Poliovirus seropositivity was 65.5% and 22% of the children were malnourished. We found that presence of Campylobacter and Veillonella, especially at an early age, was associated with low poliovirus vaccination seroconversion. These bacterial taxa differed from those associated with malnutrition. Conclusions: The presence of enteropathogens such as Campylobacter at a young age could be an important factor contributing to low vaccination seroconversion in children in LMICs.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Microbial survival assays frequently use ordered categorical (ordinal) scores, such as semi-quantitative viability scores across drug concentrations. While these ordinal data provide rich information about dose-response dynamics, they require appropriate statistical approaches for proper analysis. Proportional-odds (PO) ordinal regression is specifically designed for such data, modeling the ordered nature of scores while accommodating continuous variables such as concentration. However, despite its advantages, PO regression remains underutilized in microbiology because its cumulative log-odds outputs are abstract and biologically unintuitive. Consequently, researchers often resort to flawed alternatives: collapsing scores into binary outcomes (growth/no growth), treating scores as continuous values for t-tests or ANOVA, or applying nonparametric tests that ignore dose-response structure. Each approach sacrifices power or validity, risking unreliable conclusions. To allow researchers to better leverage the power of ordinal datasets, we introduce MIC*, a summary measure that translates PO regression results into biologically interpretable units. MIC* is defined as the treatment concentration where the predicted probability of \"no viability\" equals 0.5, and is thus conceptually related to the minimum inhibitory dose (MIC) widely used in antimicrobial research. MIC* retains the rigor of ordinal regression while providing more biologically intuitive effect size measures. The MIC* framework enables formal comparisons as absolute differences ({Delta}MIC*) or relative fold-changes ({Delta}log2MIC*), allowing for robust statistical comparisons between samples. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that MIC* yields robust estimates with superior power compared to conventional statistical methods, while case studies demonstrate practical utility. To ensure wide adoption, we provide a suite of open-source tools: a BLInded Scoring System (BLISS) for generating ordinal viability scores, and web-based (MICalculator) and R package (ordinalMIC) alternatives for performing complete MIC* analyses, thus reducing barriers to appropriate analysis of ordinal phenotypes in microbiology.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

While TLSs resemble canonical tRNAs and engage host factors, their ability to directly recruit ribosomes has remained unresolved. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy snapshots of the histidine-accepting TLS (TLSHis) from tobacco mosaic virus bound to the 60S subunit, the 80S ribosome, and the 80S-tRNAiMet initiation complex. Across these states, TLSHis is consistently anchored to the L1 stalk of 60S, even under cycloheximide treatment, yet remains dynamic on the 40S subunit. Structural analysis shows that TLSHis transitions from the E-site to an adjacent Z-site to accommodate initiator tRNA. Functional assays show that TLSHis preferentially associates with ribosomal subunits over polysomes and can substitute for a poly(A) tail to promote robust cap-dependent translation. Together, these findings reveal how a viral tRNA mimic hijacks host ribosomes to promote poly(A)-independent translation.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers a convenient, noninvasive way to track this species, yet open-set rainforest soundscapes make single-species detection challenging. We present a machine-learning pipeline with a very low false-positive rate, appropriate for downstream inference. The method combines a band-pass filter (5-10 kHz), Perch bioacoustic embeddings (deep learning), and a One-Class SVM (OCSVM) applied to sliding windows of continuous audio recordings to detect S. bicolor calls. We train on a reduced dataset of labeled calls and validate against diverse out-of-class audio (birds, anurans, anthropophony, and geophony/insects), then test on long, cross-site recordings. The approach achieves high discrimination on held-out negatives and produces very low false-positive rates in realistic, continuous audio. Finally, we pair detections with a single-site occupancy model in a cross-site setting to illustrate end-to-end utility for conservation monitoring and to estimate the false-negative detection probability in recordings from pied tamarin populations in a different geographic region. Our strategy provides a tool for PAM of S. bicolor that requires minimal manual labeling effort and can be adapted to other open-set, single-species monitoring scenarios. We also release a convenient Python package (https://pypi.org/project/sauim-detector/), installable via pip, that processes an audio file and produces detection timestamps as an Audacity label file (.txt), enabling faster manual verification.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

To advance the development of a comprehensive pangenome reference, we present new de novo genome assemblies of two genetically and ecologically distinct lines: Whale Rock (WR; wild, landlocked, Central California) and Keithley Creek (KC; wild, resident, interior Columbia Basin), along with the previously published assemblies of the Arlee (domesticated, Northern California) and Swanson (semi-domesticated, resident, Alaska) lines. All assemblies provide nearly complete coverage of known genes (BUSCO 95.8-99.7%) and are similar in genome size (~2.3 Gb), with scaffold N50 values between 3.4 Mb (KC) and 52.4 Mb (Swanson). Comparative whole-genome alignments revealed high sequence conservation (97-98% identity) among assemblies, but also evidence of extensive structural variation of at least 50 bp in length. Structural variant (SV) profiling identified tens of thousands of deletions, insertions, and complex rearrangements largely in noncoding sequences. In an initial assessment of the utility of having multiple de novo genome assemblies for rainbow trout, we found that two strains (Arlee and Swanson; domesticated) share SVs enriched in genes linked with growth, reproduction, and adaptation to domestication, such as GTP binding and ECM-receptor interaction. In comparison, the other two strains (WR and KC; wild origin) share SVs associated with reproductive timing such as GnRH signaling pathway. Both Arlee and WR also have unique SVs potentially related to their geographic origin and unique life history. Additionally, we identified SVs in key regions, such as a QTL for fillet yield on Omy17 and the maturation-associated SIX6/ER{beta}-GPHB5 locus on Omy25q, suggesting the importance of considering SVs when investigating the genomics of complex traits. Together, these assemblies and comparative analyses establish a foundation for a rainbow trout pangenome reference, illuminating how they can be utilized to reveal the structural genomic basis of domestication, adaptation, and other complex traits in O. mykiss.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The human somatic genome evolves throughout our lifespan, producing mosaic individuals comprising clones harboring different mutations across tissues. While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a 'temporal microscope', while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost-efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors' and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors' exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to ~35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

While fluorescence microscopy provides a convenient method for reading out signal from microfluidic assays, commercially-available microscopes impose a fundamental tradeoff between temporal resolution, spatial resolution, and numerical aperture (NA). Spatially tiled imaging enables high-resolution and high-NA imaging over a large area but reduces temporal resolution. Conversely, low magnification, low NA imaging captures large areas in one shot, but typically sacrifices spatial resolution and fluorescence sensitivity. To address this, we introduce an automated transfluorescence tandem-macro-lens optomechanical system (macroscope) capable of sensitive, multi-channel fluorescence imaging over a very large field of view (34 mm diameter, 740 mm2), with resolution determined by the sensor pixel size. We demonstrate bright-field resolution of low-micron features and detection of low- to mid-nanomolar concentrations of common fluorophores within microfluidic device channels. To demonstrate the utility of this macroscope, we image enzyme turnover within valved microfluidic devices (the HT-MEK system, for High-Throughput Microfluidic Enzyme Kinetics) and achieve >50-fold increased temporal resolution over common commercial instruments while maintaining high sensitivity.

Although hypoxia contributes a significant role in these conditions, the ability to accurately and instantaneously monitor the presence of hypoxia in vivo and correlate comprehensive analysis of hypoxia-dependent molecular signatures in response to treatments regimens is lacking. With the advent of hypoxia-responsive contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including the recent development and characterization by our team of a novel probe that involves both 19F and EuII, the capability to integrate direct hypoxia imaging in real-time with new technologies that enable spatial transcriptomic profiling has become a possibility. To assess the capability of this agent for studying hypoxia, we used osteosarcoma as a model. In this preliminary study we demonstrate two major results: First, we show that convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a reliable and robust methodology to distribute MRI contrast agents throughout a tumor. Second, we show that integration of direct hypoxia-detecting imaging modalities and spatial biology enables real-time in vivo insights into biology and identification of biomarkers directly applicable to disease development and response to therapy. The ability to identify and define hypoxia-mediated biology using direct rather than indirect MRI methods has extremely significant implications in the care of a wide-range of pathological conditions. Consequently, the framework outlined in these preliminary studies is applicable to other pathological conditions and provides the basis for direct in vivo hypoxia detection, monitoring, and biological analyses with translational applications to patient care and management.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

The A. fulvescens were from two genetically distinct populations (Burntwood River and Winnipeg River, Manitoba, Canada) that were acclimated to three different temperatures (16, 20, and 24 {degrees}C) to quantify the effects of genetic background and acclimation temperatures on the transcriptomic response to acute thermal stress. Additionally, juvenile A. oxyrinchus oxyrinchus and A. brevirostrum were acclimated to 10 {degrees}C and then experienced acute thermal stress. All three species were sampled for gill and liver before and after experiencing acute thermal stress, which was applied using a CTmax test. The expression of 52 genes of interest was quantified using the multispecies qPCR chip for all three species, along with 4 reference genes. We showed that acute thermal stress affected the mRNA expression of 17-26 of the thermal metabolic stress genes that were assayed using the chip, depending on the species.

While the impact of small-scale biogeography on several emergent biofilm properties has been characterized by a variety of laboratory studies using simple synthetic communities, the extent of small-scale biogeography in environmental biofilms, as well as its impact on sequencing-based studies, remain poorly characterized. Here, we investigate centimeter-scale biogeography in potable water biofilms developed in environments with distinct levels of heterogeneity. We then estimate microbial diversity at scales relevant for microbial interactions and characterize the impact of sampling strategies on both alpha and beta diversity metrics, as well as on inferred co-occurrences and scaling laws. Our results show that biofilm sections in seemingly homogeneous environments are characterized by similar biogeographic patterns as the ones in a more heterogeneous one, albeit with lower cm-scale variability. We estimated that, despite the overall richness over the entire biofilms, single cells are surrounded by local neighborhoods of limited diversity, strongly limiting their possibility for diverse interactions. Larger sampling areas average such local heterogeneities and distort community structure estimates, leading to an inflated and erroneous estimation of co-occurrences and potential metabolic interactions. Finally, we report how both environmental heterogeneity, as well as sample area size, influence scaling law performances. Our results highlight the ubiquitous nature of biofilm biogeography and call for the adaptation of biofilm sampling strategies to consider this phenomenon relative to specific research questions.", "date": "2025-10-13", "journal": ""}

This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate. Oxidative stress sensing by EEF1G slows translation, enhancing production of detoxifying selenoproteins to restore homeostasis.

Variant specific accumulation patterns for overexpressed -Syn were observed without changes to bouton structure. Additionally, increases of both -Syn variants affected presynaptic proteins, decreasing MYCBP2 puncta count and intensity, and reducing ELKS protein density.
