It is flexible enough to identify cases where knowledge from prior tasks is relevant, even when many features of the current task are different, such as the sensory stimuli or the size of the task state space. We have previously shown that in abstract tasks, humans can generalise knowledge in cases where the only cross-task shared feature is the statistical rules that govern the tasks state-state relationships. Here, we hypothesized that this capacity is associated with generalisable representations in the entorhinal cortex (EC). This hypothesis was based on the ECs generalisable representations in spatial tasks and recent discoveries about its role in the representation of abstract tasks. We first develop an analysis method capable of testing for such representations in fMRI data, explain why other common methods would have failed for our task, and validate our method through a combination of electrophysiological data analysis, simulations and fMRI sanity checks. We then show with fMRI that EC representations generalise across complex non-spatial tasks that share a hexagonal grid structural form but differ in their size and sensory stimuli, i.e. their only shared feature is the rules governing their statistical structure. There was no clear evidence for such generalisation in EC for non-spatial tasks with clustered, as opposed to planar, structure.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

To better understand the function of KRASG12C and possible G12Ci bypass mechanisms, we developed an autochthonous KRASG12C-driven PDAC model. Compared to the classical KRASG12D PDAC model, the G12C model exhibits slower tumor growth, yet similar histopathological and molecular features. Aligned with clinical experience, G12Ci treatment of KRASG12C tumors produced modest impact despite stimulating a \"hot\" tumor immune microenvironment. Immunoprofiling revealed that CD24, a \"do not eat me\" signal, is significantly upregulated on cancer cells upon G12Ci treatment. Blocking CD24 enhanced macrophage phagocytosis of cancer cells and significantly sensitized tumors to G12Ci treatment. Similar findings were observed in KRASG12D-driven PDAC. Together, this study reveals common and distinct oncogenic KRAS allele-specific biology and identifies a clinically actionable adaptive mechanism that may improve the efficacy of oncogenic KRAS inhibitor therapy in PDAC.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

We examined language lateralization using fMRI in two large developmental cohorts (total n=273 children aged 4-16 years; n=107 adults). Strong, adult-like LH lateralization (in response magnitude and activation volume) was evident by age 4, although other features of the LH language network showed protracted development, including the magnitude of language response and the strength of functional connectivity.

Here, we show that the linkage disequilibria, which stabilizing selection generates on a rapid timescale, slow down the subsequent allele-frequency dynamics at individual loci, which proceed on a much longer timescale. Exploiting this separation of timescales, we obtain expressions for the expected per-generation change in minor-allele frequency at individual loci, as functions of the effect sizes at these loci, the strength of selection on the trait, its variance and heritability, and the linkage relations among loci.

RNA data-mining identified the ER-shaping protein Reticulon-1 as a relevant candidate across eight axonal transcriptomes. Using microfluidic chambers, we demonstrate that local knockdown of Reticulon-1 synthesis increases the outgrowth of injured cortical axons while reducing their distal tubulin levels. Furthermore, we show by live-cell imaging that axonal Reticulon-1 knockdown restores the microtubule growth rate and track length modified by injury. Interestingly, local inhibition of the microtubule-severing protein Spastin prevents the axonal knockdown-mediated effects over outgrowth and tubulin levels.

The pathogenesis of ML-DS is tightly linked to fetal hematopoiesis and mutations in GATA1, generating the truncated GATA1short(s) isoform. We identified Delta-like non-canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1) as a direct GATA1s target. DLK1, a paternally imprinted transmembrane protein, is highly expressed in fetal liver CD34+ cells but absent in adult hematopoiesis, making it an attractive immunotherapeutic target. Chromatin profiling revealed GATA1s occupancy at a distal enhancer within the DLK1-DIO3 locus, driving aberrant DLK1 upregulation in ML-DS. Functional studies demonstrated that DLK1 is a leukemia dependency, as its genetic ablation impaired proliferation and engraftment, induced apoptosis, and altered Notch and {beta}-catenin signaling. Therapeutically, a DLK1-directed antibody-drug conjugate (DLK1-ADC) induced selective cytotoxicity, abrogated colony formation, and significantly prolonged survival in refractory ML-DS PDX models, achieving durable remissions at higher doses.

Here we employed and compared a simple spin filtration method to cleanup solutions of extracted viruses for direct observation with cryo-electron microscopy. Although relatively simple, the method employs common physical biochemical separation steps to remove large and small debris which dramatically improves image quality and preservation of structural features to permit visualizing morphotypes not typically seen with conventional negative stain approaches.

This study utilized the chloride sensitive indicator (6-Methoxyquinolinio) acetic acid ethyl ester bromide (MQAE) combined with fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) to examine whether application of the convulsant, pilocarpine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, could induce synchronous epileptiform activity and elevate intracellular chloride concentrations in hippocampal slice cultures.

Here, via an RNAi suppressor screen, we found that inhibition of the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-180 increases mitochondrial function and the rate of development in atfs-1(null) worms. NHR-180 is activated during mitochondrial dysfunction and induces transcription of genes required for protein synthesis on cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomes. Importantly, the NHR-180 ligand binding domain interacts with AMP, which results in increased protein synthesis potentially to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and recovery from transient mitochondrial perturbations. However, NHR-180 exacerbates the mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutations in genes required for oxidative phosphorylation. Consistent with these findings, we found that inhibition of the S6 kinase homolog RSKS-1 also increased mitochondrial function in atfs-1(null) worms.

Well-trained models allow the detection of nucleotide-specific molecular signatures through changes in ionic current as DNA molecules translocate through the nanopore. Thus, naturally occurring DNA modifications, such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, may be recorded simultaneously with the genetic sequence. Additional genomic information, such as chromatin state or the locations of bound transcription factors, may also be recorded if their locations are chemically encoded into the DNA. Here, we present a versatile \"write-and-read\" framework, where chemo-enzymatic DNA labeling with unnatural synthetic tags results in predictable electrical fingerprints in nanopore sequencing. As a proof-of-concept, we explore a DNA glucosylation approach that selectively modifies 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) with glucose or glucose-azide adducts. We demonstrate that these modifications generate distinct and reproducible electrical shifts, enabling the direct detection of chemically altered nucleotides. We further demonstrate that enzymatic alkylation, such as the enzymatic transfer of azide residues to the N6 position of adenines, also produces characteristic nanopore signal shifts relative to the native adenine and 6-methyladenine. Beyond direct nucleotide detection, this approach introduces new possibilities for bio-orthogonal DNA labeling, enabling an extended alphabet of sequence-specific detectable moieties.

BABAPPA v2.0 (Bash-Based Automated Parallel Positive Selection Analysis) addresses these challenges by providing a fully automated, modular framework that streamlines all stages of codeml analysis from sequence quality control to statistically validated results. In contrast to v1.0, which offered only the basic workflow, v2.0 introduces three flavours: babappa_normal (classic codeml pipeline), babappa_clip (integrating ClipKIT-based alignment trimming with codon integrity checks), and babappa_clipgard (further incorporating recombination detection via HyPhy GARD). These options allow users to balance speed, robustness, and biological realism according to dataset characteristics. In addition, a dedicated graphical user interface (GUI) makes the pipeline accessible to researchers without command-line experience by providing installer-based setup, intuitive workflow selection, and organized results management. Benchmarking on Brassicaceae ortholog sets demonstrated that BABAPPA v2.0 reproduces the exact positive-selection calls of conventional manual workflows while reducing runtime by ~45% (equivalent to an ~80% speedup). By combining reproducibility, efficiency, and usability, BABAPPA v2.0 offers the first practical end-to-end solution for large-scale genome-wide codeml-based selection analyses.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Homology-based scaffolding is the task of ordering contigs based on their co-linearity with the DNA sequence of other, closely related reference genomes. We investigate here how a recent approach to identify synteny anchors can be adapted to this task. The advantage of using anchors is that \"sufficiently unique\" anchor candidates can be precomputed independently for each genome assembly, including contig-level drafts. This allows an efficient identification of co-linear runs of anchor matches between a contig and a reference genome and, consequently, also order their contigs in relation to the reference. Such data can be improved by aggregating scaffolding results for multiple reference genomes. We present a prototypical pipeline based on the anchor-based synteny detection tool AncST and show that it produces scaffolds with accuracies comparable to competing tools at acceptable computational costs. Assuming that anchor candidates have been precomputed for the genomes of interest, the remaining computational efforts are on par with the fastest methods. Finally, the results suggest that our approach is particularly well suited for homology-based scaffolding with multiple references. Homology-based scaffolds can effectively be computed with a greedy-like approach using synteny anchors. The method performs comparably well with advantages regarding scaffold contiguity and multi-reference scaffolding.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Identification of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between male and female worms could reveal critical signaling pathways that are involved in sexual maturation and egg production. In the study, quantitative proteome and phosphoproteome profiles were obtained from adult male and female worms of S. japonicum. A total of 2,710 unique proteins, including 2,055 proteins and 924 phosphorylated proteins, were identified. We identifed 252 (~12.5%) non-phosphorylated and 209 (11.7%) phosphorylated DEPs between males and females. Combined with the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) results, 22 non-phosphorylated DEPs exhibited corresponding mRNA-level changes. Next, several identified non-phosphorylated DEPs were further shown to be involved in sex-biased biological processes, including vitellocyte development, oviposition, and parasite mobility by RNA interference, which were also supported by their cellular niches by analyzing previously published single-cell RNA seq data. Furthermore, we annotated 96 kinases of S. japonicum based on the obtained phosphorylated proteins, of which CMGC/MAPK, Atypical/RIO are significantly activated in males, while CAMK/CAMKL, AGC/DMPK, and STE/STE7 are activated in females. Finally, the potential drugs targeting these kinases were determined in silico, resulting in the identification of 28 S. japonicum kinases as potentially targetable by 30 FDA-approved drugs. Overall, our study provided a collection of evidence-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic resources of S. japonicum and identified sex-biased proteins, phosphopeptides, and kinases, which could serve as potentially effective targets for developing novel interventions against schistosomiasis.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

In the gastrointestinal tract, obesogenic high-fat diets enhance intestinal stem cell activity and tumorigenesis. However, the impact of ketogenic diets (KD), which contain even higher lipid content but induce ketogenesis, remains poorly understood. This is particularly relevant for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), who face a high risk of small intestinal tumours. Here, we combine dietary, genetic, and metabolic manipulations in mouse models of spontaneous intestinal adenoma formation to dissect the role of systemic and epithelial ketogenesis in intestinal cancer. We show that KD accelerates tumour burden and shortens survival, independent of ketone body production. Through genetic manipulation of the ketogenic pathway, we modulate local and systemic ketone body production; however, neither inhibition nor augmentation of the ketogenic enzyme HMGCS2 nor disruption of ketolysis altered tumour progression. In contrast, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation did limit adenomatous formation. These findings reveal that dietary lipid content, through FAO rather than ketone body metabolism, influences intestinal tumorigenesis and highlight the need for nuanced consideration of dietary strategies for cancer prevention in genetically susceptible populations.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

We introduce BiSpectral EEG Component Analysis (BiSCA), a framework unifying power spectral and bispectral analysis to test for nonlinearity by identifying inter-frequency harmonic relationships and disambiguating them from superimposed components. Crucially, simulations confirm its ability to separate true nonlinearity from non-Gaussianity - a common confound. Applying this test to two large human brain recordings datasets (1,771 intracranial channels and 960 individuals' scalp EEG), we find the brain's broadband, aperiodic background behaves as a linear, Gaussian process, while narrowband Rho oscillatory - including the Alpha and Mu rhythms - are the primary source of cortical nonlinearity, exhibiting significant quadratic cross-frequency coupling. Both recordings show significant departures from linear Gaussian behavior. We observe a striking dissociation between signal power and nonlinearity. While the occipital Alpha rhythm dominates the power spectrum, the strongest nonlinear signatures arise from the less dominant parietal Mu rhythm. These findings suggest that nonlinear resonance is pervasive in cortical signals, primarily expressed through resonant oscillations rather than aperiodic activity. Without accounting for these intrinsic nonlinear interactions, a principled understanding of neural activity will be incomplete.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Plants have evolved myriad dynamic biochemical, physiological, and morphological adaptations to cope with nutritional Pi deficiency, collectively known as the Pi starvation response (PSR). While many components of the PSR have been well-characterized, much less is known about how metabolic homeostasis is re-established upon Pi resupply, particularly with respect to tissue- and time-specific adaptations. Here, we applied label-free quantitative proteomics to quantify protein-level changes in Arabidopsis thaliana shoots and roots following Pi resupply after prolonged Pi deprivation, quantifying a total of ~2,700 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). Sampling at early (1 h) and late (48 h) time-points, we captured a combination of immediate signaling and metabolic responses, along with longer-term recovery processes. Early responses prioritized metabolic adjustments to restore Pi pools via enhanced glycolysis and energy production, followed by later shifts toward anabolism, including nucleotide production, membrane remodeling, and protein synthesis. Several key enzymes, including ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE 1A, FRUCTOSE-BISPHOSPHATE ALDOLASE 5, and subunits of PHOTOSYSTEM I exhibited unique tissue-specific and time-dependent regulation.

Accurate semantic segmentation of these images is critical for both clinical and research applications, yet existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods face challenges in generalizability and robustness. This study introduces MAYOCTransformer, the first transformer-based deep learning model for comprehensive semantic segmentation of OCT images, and evaluates its performance against CNN-based models. Methods: A large dataset of 3,500 OCT images was manually segmented using an iterative deep learning-assisted workflow. The MAYOCTransformer model, based on the Mask2Former architecture, was trained and compared against CNN-based segmentation models, including U-Net, U-Net++, FPN, and DeepLabV3+. Comprehensive segmentation tasks included 10 retinal layer segmentation, choroid stroma and vessel segmentation, and the identification of 9 types of discrete pathological findings including intraretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), pigment epithelial detachment (PED), subretinal hyper-reflective material (SHRM), intraretinal hyper-reflective foci, and reticular pseudodrusen. Model performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) on a hold-out test set with five-fold cross-validation. Additional validation was performed using external datasets, open-source segmentation models, and a randomized blinded expert evaluation. Results: MAYOCTransformer outperformed CNN-based models in most segmentation tasks. Choroid segmentation performance was comparable between MAYOCTransformer and CNN models. External validation demonstrated the model's generalizability, achieving higher DSC scores than publicly available segmentation models. A blinded expert evaluation showed that MAYOCTransformer's segmentation was non-inferior to manual annotations. Conclusion: MAYOCTransformer provides improved segmentation performance over CNN-based models.

The parts have spatial locations as does the whole and we can ask, how do the locations of the parts influence the perceived location of the whole? The answer may depend on the nature of the parts, the processes that generate them: the influence of single birds on the location of a flock may be different from that of single pedestrians on the location of a crowd. We treated the parts as samples from a probability density function (PDF) and asked participants to estimate the location of the generating PDF given a sample. The generating PDFs belonged to one of three location families, Gaussian, Laplacian or Uniform. Observers received training with each family and knew which family the generating PDF came from on each trial. We compared human performance to that of the Uniform Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator (UMVUE) for each location family. We based our analyses on the measured influence of each sample point, a measure of how the observer made use of each sample point in estimating the center. Observers used different estimators for different families and the estimator chosen for samples from each family were close to the UMVUE for that family. How does the observer calculate approximate UMVUEs for the three location families considered? We propose that a critical step is to estimate the locations of visual clusters in the sample. The Visual Cluster Model accurately captured human performance across all three distributions. Our findings suggest that the observers estimate of the location of the whole is based not directly on the locations of the parts but rather on the clusters they form.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

While previous studies have linked ATF4 activation with promoting cardiomyocyte (CM) death in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, its role in developing CMs remains unexplored.\n\nMETHODSWe generated multiple distinct CM-specific (Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA), Atf4cKO(e2) and Atf4cKO(e2/3/nopA)) and global Atf4 knockout (Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins) mouse models targeting different Atf4 regions, as well as cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 to study cardiac phenotypes. Detailed morphological and molecular analyses were performed.\n\nRESULTSAtf4cKO(e2/3/pA) (targeting exon 2-3 including the polyadenylation signal (polyA)) mice exhibited severe cardiac defects and died before E17.5, likely due to ectopic activation of p53 signaling pathway resulting from Rps19bp1 downregulation, a potent suppressor of p53. Further investigation revealed that deleting the polyA signal of Atf4 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice led to transcriptional readthrough, resulting in the formation of an Atf4-Cacna1i fusion transcript and Rps19bp1 downregulation. To avoid readthrough while abolishing ATF4 function, we introduced small indels into exon 3 of Atf4 in mice (Atf47del/7del and Atf41ins/1ins), which showed normal Rps19bp1 expression and cardiac morphology. Furthermore, CM-specific deletion of exons 2-3 while retaining the polyA signal (Atf4cKO(e2/3/nopA)) mice had no effect on cardiac development. Importantly, CM-specific deletion of Rps19bp1 recapitulated the cardiac defects and transcriptional change seen in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWe found that the downregulation of Rps19bp1, not loss of ATF4 function, underlying the cardiac phenotypes in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice. The reduced expression of Rps19bp1 in Atf4cKO(e2/3/pA) mice is likely due to the unintentional deletion of Atf4 polyA signal and subsequent transcriptional readthrough, underscoring the essential role of RPS19BP1, not ATF4, in cardiac development. Consistent Rps19bp1 downregulation has been observed in other tissue-specific Atf4 knockout models utilizing the Atf4fl(e2/3/pA) allele, suggesting that previously reported Atf4 KO phenotypes may result from Atf4 transcriptional readthrough effects. These findings reveal a locus-dependent transcriptional interference mechanism and emphasize the importance of avoiding confounding cis effects in genetically engineered models.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Its formation is mutually exclusive with the branchpoint-interacting stem loop (BSL) present in U2 snRNA. While BSL structure impacts splicing with the strict consensus branchpoint sequence of yeast introns, its influence in the flexible context of human branchpoints is unknown. We employed an orthogonal U2 snRNA and splicing reporter to examine the impact of perturbing BSL base-pairing and found differential effects on both orthogonal U2 snRNA expression and reporter splicing, indicating that BSL structure influences the biogenesis of U2 snRNP and its function in splicing. Furthermore, high complementarity between the branchpoint sequence and U2 snRNA increases splicing efficiency with wildtype and stabilized BSL, but not when BSL base-pairing is reduced. These data are consistent with complementarity between the intron and the loop of the BSL driving intron-mediated unwinding of the BSL stem. Finally, we investigated transcriptome-wide effects of expressing U2 snRNA with either a cancer-associated BSL mutation or with an altered branchpoint recognition sequence. Similar changes in splicing and gene expression suggests that while altered U2 snRNA is tolerated, cells respond by upregulating genes linked to oncogenic pathways.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

These modes are constructed from the divergence and vorticity of the time-varying unit-phase vector field derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. We show that the canonical routing modes are flexibly combined to generate distinct, state- and function-dependent flow architectures that remain consistent across individuals. Disruption to the routing mode dynamics mechanistically links structural abnormalities and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.

Semenogelin-1 (SEMG1) is the predominant protein in the seminal plasma and a major structural component of the semen coagulum in humans and mice. SEMG1 binds EPPIN (Epididymal protease inhibitor) on the sperm surface, transiently inhibiting the acquisition of sperm motility and hyperactivation after ejaculation. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying SEMG1-mediated inhibition of sperm hyperactivation remain unclear. We hypothesize that the SEMG1 effects are associated with the inhibition of CatSper, a sperm-specific calcium channel crucial for triggering hyperactivation. We observed that recombinant mouse SEMG1 (mSEMG1) inhibited both progressive motility and hyperactivation in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, hyperactivation was not recovered upon NH4Cl-induced alkalinization, suggesting that the effects of mSEMG1 are downstream of capacitation-associated intracellular alkalinization. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that mSEMG1 impaired CatSper currents at concentrations near its IC50 for inhibiting sperm hyperactivation. Recombinant mSEMG1 truncations mSEMG1Q32-V118 and mSEMG1R98-G375, but not mSEMG1Y221-G375, independently inhibited sperm hyperactivation and CatSper currents similar to full-length mSEMG1. However, only mSEMG1R98-G375 displayed similar EPPIN-binding capacity comparable to full-length mSEMG1, whereas mSEMG1Q32-V118 and mSEMG1Y221-G375 showed only minor binding. Our findings reveal that mouse SEMG1 comprises two distinct functional domains within the Q32-V118 and R98-S220 sequences, which contribute to the inhibition of sperm hyperactivation by targeting the CatSper channel, both independently and dependent on EPPIN binding.

We show that acute pharmacological inactivation of the VP, via microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol, decreased social play behaviors in both sexes. Next, using Gad1-iCre rats, we show that chemogenetic stimulation of NAcGABA terminals in the VP decreased VP neuronal activation and decreased social play behaviors in both sexes. These findings together indicate that reduced inhibitory NAc input to the VP permits activation of the VP which facilitates the expression of social play behaviors. Lastly, we show that the equal expression of social play behavior in males and females is associated with a female-specific increase in NAc shell activation and a male-specific decrease in activation of the NAc shell neurons projecting to the VP. These sex-specific changes in NAc activity following social play exposure eliminated baseline sex differences in NAc activity. In conclusion, these findings support a model in which the sex-specific modulation of NAc inhibitory input to the VP facilitates activation of the VP that is necessary for the typical and equal expression of social play behavior in male and female juvenile rats.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

However, there was a small effect of the texture of the ground surface and of the scale of the environment. In Experiment 4, we show that there may be a very low ceiling effect in the density of a starfield needed to accurately estimate travel distance. Together these experiments have implications for the design of real and virtual environments where perceived motion is important and will enable us to further predict our perception of moving through an environment.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

We show that this assumption fails in functionally specific ways. Using moving tactile stimuli on the hand, participants perceived stimulus direction on the fingertips as reversed when hand posture changed - reporting motion as if it originated from the opposite side of the skin, while responses on the palm were less consistent and less sensitive to posture. Congenitally blind participants exhibited stable, individualized surface assignments on the fingertips, demonstrating that vision is not required to construct oriented tactile surfaces. However, visual experience modulated posture effects: sighted individuals showed posture-dependent skin-orientation assignments driven by motion direction, whereas congenitally blind individuals showed posture-invariant assignments determined by functional use. These findings indicate that tactile surface perception is not globally fixed but dynamically inferred according to functional demands; rather than enforcing a purely geometric body-world boundary, the brain flexibly assigns where the surface is and which side we occupy.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Prior maps in dogs were based on the canFam3.1 genome assembly, which contains thousands of sequence gaps that include functional elements. Although long-read technologies have enabled the generation of updated reference assemblies, updated maps are required to take full advantage of these new resources. Methods: We inferred fine-scale recombination maps that consider population demographic history for four populations of village dogs sequenced by the Dog10K Consortium. We compare properties among the newly generated and previously published maps and assess the effects of genetic map choice on genotype phasing accuracy. Results: The newly inferred maps are broadly consistent with previous studies of recombination in dogs. At small scales, stronger correlations are observed among maps inferred using linkage disequilibrium than with a pedigree-based map. The position of recombination hotspots showed significant overlap among inferred maps and were enriched for sequences that were gaps in a previous canine genome assembly. When using the Dog10K samples as a reference panel, a phase error rate of approximately 2% was found with the choice of genetic map having little effect. Conclusions: We describe genetic maps based on the canFam4 assembly which will be useful for future studies of genetic variation that rely on updated dog genome references.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

In primates, glutamatergic Cb efferents from the deep cerebellar nuclei and GABAergic BG efferents from the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) terminate in distinct subregions of VL: the posterior (VLp) and anterior (VLa) divisions, respectively. This anatomical segregation suggests that Cb- and BG-thalamocortical circuits may play distinct roles in motor control, which could be revealed by comparing movement-related activity in VLp and VLa. Here, we recorded single-unit activity from VLp and VLa, identified via electrical stimulation of superior cerebellar peduncle and GPi, during a choice reaction time reaching task. We also recorded from M1, which maintains bidirectional connections with both VLp and VLa. VLa neurons exhibited a significantly higher proportion of decrease-type responses compared with VLp and M1, consistent with inhibitory GPi input. Time-resolved general linear model analysis showed dynamic encoding of task parameters, particularly movement direction, in all three regions. Direction encoding was strongest in M1, moderate in VLp, and weakest in VLa. Direction encoding in VLa also lagged behind that in M1 and VLp. Clustering analysis of direction encoding strength and timing revealed a subpopulation of VLp neurons that encoded direction particularly strongly during the reaction time period. These results highlight a limitation of traditional assumptions that activity characteristics are distributed homogeneously across neural populations and point to a novel functional organization within VLp neurons.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Localized reductions in pyramidal cell activity may contribute to associated symptoms, and effective antidepressant treatments typically enhance overall neuronal excitation. CCL5 is a chemokine that has been shown to reduce excitatory-neuronal activity, and is also increased with MDD and conditions that increase MDD risk. Here, we investigate the CCL5/CCR5 axis for its ability to modulate depression-relevant endpoints that are diminished in MDD, including neuronal oscillations, as well as biochemical and behavioral correlates of the disorder. In comparison to wildtype mice, CCR5 knockouts had increased gamma and theta power, and stronger theta/high-gamma phase amplitude coupling during dark-cycle EEG recordings. Compared to strain-matched wildtype mice, CCR5 knockouts also demonstrated reduced anxiety, increased sucrose preference, and improved associative memory. Proteomic analysis of the hippocampus showed that CCR5 knockouts had reduced levels of the GABA receptor alpha-4 subunit, which mediates tonic inhibition and restricts pyramidal cell plasticity. In complementary primary neuronal culture studies, CCL5 diminished GSK-beta activity and impaired NMDA-dependent long-term depression (LTD), a form of plasticity that promotes cognitive flexibility. In addition,CCL5 signaling reduced parvalbumin expression in GABAergic neurons through a CCR5-dependent manner. In combination with the ability of CCR5 to restrain gamma oscillation power and LTD, our data raise the possibility that CCL5/CCR5 signaling inhibits neuronal excitation through increased PV+ interneuron activity. Moreover, data are consistent with the possibility that CCR5 antagonists might share the ability of established antidepressants to both increase PC excitation and reduce PC inhibition.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Current theories assume that this adaptation process entails the operation of multiple learning systems, with a key division between implicit and explicit components. Recent studies have revealed several inconsistencies regarding the characteristics and constraints of the implicit system, suggesting that the current framework is incomplete. Here, we propose that these conflicting findings can be understood by recognizing that there are multiple implicit subcomponents, distinguished by their distinct computational goals. One well-studied component is implicit recalibration, a process critical for action execution which uses sensory-prediction errors to automatically refine the sensorimotor map. Here we describe a second, novel component, implicit aiming, a process which contributes to action selection to achieve the specific goals. Through a series of studies, we find compelling evidence that those two implicit processes show a clear separation in their temporal stabilities and contextual modulations. These distinct properties correspond to different computational frameworks attributing learning dynamics to either contextual inference or cancellation of competing neural populations, respectively.

G.", "abstract": "Neuronal filters describe the neuronal information processing building blocks where specific frequency components of the output are enhanced over others. The result of the interaction of neuronal filters across nodes in a network is captured by the frequency-dependent amplitude and phase-difference coupling coefficients (CCs), respectively, which extend the notion of the steady-state CC to include frequency-dependent processes. These metrics are shaped by the interplay of the participating ionic and synaptic currents and the external inputs. The underlying biophysical and dynamic mechanisms are largely unknown beyond electrically coupled passive cells. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism of interaction of cellular neuronal filters in electrically coupled networks. We use biophysically plausible (conductance-based) mathematical modeling, numerical simulations, analytical calculations and dynamical systems tools. We focus on a family of models that include gap junction connected cells and compartmental models of spatially extended neurons. We consider a network of two electrically connected nodes receiving oscillatory inputs. This is the minimal network architecture that allows for a systematic study of the biophysical and dynamic mechanisms that shape the CC profiles. The participating neurons are either passive cells (low-pass filters) or resonators (band-pass filter) and exhibit lagging or mixed leading-lagging phase-shift responses as the input frequency increases. First, we use linear models to understand how the participating building blocks (e.g., conductances, negative and positive feedback effects) operating at the single node level give rise to the amplitude and phase CC profiles with band-pass filtering properties. Then, we extend our investigation and use linearized models of nonlinear of neurons with biophysically realistic ionic currents to investigate (to the linear level of approximation) how the presence of cellular ionic currents and cellular resonance/phasonance contribute to shaping the corresponding (amplitude and phase) CC profiles and determine their preferred coupling frequencies. Motivated by experimental results on subthreshold resonance in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, we use three ionic currents: persistent sodium (amplifying), mixed sodium-potassium h- (resonant and hyperpolarization-activated) and M-type slow potassium (resonant and depolarization-activated). Finally, we extend our investigation to include the model nonlinearities to understand how the CC profiles are shaped by the interaction between the pre-J and post-J cells, and not just the post-J cells as it is the case for linear models. For gap junction connected networks, the connectivity is typically symmetric, while for compartmental models is asymmetric as the result of the different geometries of the participating compartments. We investigate the effects of asymmetric connectivity to understand how the compartmental geometry interacts with the neuronal biophysical properties to shape the CC profiles and determine the preferred coupling frequencies. The formalism and tools we develop and use in this paper can be extended to larger networks with an arbitrary number of nodes, to spatially extended multicompartment neuronal models, and to neurons having other types of ionic currents such as the T-type calcium current. The principles that emerge from our study are directly applicable to these scenarios.

Conventionally, categorical decisions are thought to precede motor actions. However, recent studies in nonhuman primates challenge this assumption -- when perceptual decisions were uncoupled from the actions they bear upon, animals postponed the decisions until relevant response options were revealed. To determine whether this postponement stems from cognitive limitations unique to nonhuman primates, we conducted a similar experiment with human subjects. Naive subjects viewed a random-dot motion (RDM) stimulus that was difficult to categorize. After a delay period following the RDM, two choice targets were presented and subjects decided which target lay closer to the perceived motion direction. Decision accuracy varied across subjects, reflecting individual differences in ability to integrate motion evidence. Notably, subjects with higher decision accuracy showed prolonged deliberation after choice-target presentation. Furthermore, the time they took to report their decisions depended on the strength of the motion evidence. This pattern of accuracy and decision reporting time could be accounted for by a bounded diffusion model in which subjects sequentially sample stored sensory information from memory during the target selection phase. When the RDM was challenging to categorize, the subsequent appearance of the targets provided a framework to interrogate stored evidence and render a decision. Our results reveal a strategic feature of working memory of retaining information based on its future utility. This observation opens new avenues for investigating how memory and decision-making interact.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Here we show that PD risk variants converge on distinct molecular networks across specific brain cell types, enabling stratification of patients into six subgroups: dopaminergic, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (O), excitatory (E), dopaminergic/excitatory, dopaminergic/oligodendrocyte and other. While all subgroups exhibit motor symptoms, the E-group individuals also display more severe non-motor symptoms, including dementia, hyposmia, and REM sleep behavior disorder. The O-group individuals exhibit reduced myelin integrity, as demonstrated by diffusion tensor imaging, implicating NRG6 (formerly C1orf56), a previously uncharacterized high-risk PD gene. We show that NRG6 encodes a conserved epidermal growth factor-like domain structurally and functionally analogous to neuregulin-1, which is critical for oligodendrocyte development and myelination. These findings redefine the cellular architecture of PD vulnerability and identify neuregulin-like signaling in oligodendrocytes as a potential contributor to non-motor symptoms.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

However, prior research on planning often conflated it with either spatial navigation or reward-based learning, and little is known about the relative encoding of the immediate and instrumental value of the same action. We used a novel fMRI task in which participants repeatedly chose between two options, each with an immediate monetary value and a known future-oriented instrumental value. Our results show that striatal activity is positively correlated with instrumental value, whereas activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and bilateral insula is negatively correlated with the instantaneous point value.

Its effects during the subacute period (~2-24 h post-infusion), when psychotomimetic symptoms fade and neuroplastic adaptations emerge, are less well characterised. This study assessed ketamine's subacute effects on reward processing using the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. Methods: In a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 28 healthy participants received 0.5 mg/kg racemic ketamine or placebo via 40-minute intravenous infusion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was acquired ~5 h post-infusion. Plasma concentrations of ketamine and norketamine were obtained for individual area under the curve (AUC) estimation. Analyses focused on the contrast between expected and actual trial outcomes. Results: At five hours post-infusion, ketamine did not significantly modulate MID task-related brain activation, despite pronounced subjective drug effects. Pharmacokinetic modelling confirmed expected ketamine and norketamine profiles, but neither drug exposure (AUC) nor subjective measures correlated with neural activation. Conclusions: Prohedonic effects of ketamine may not sufficiently manifest in MID task-related activation in healthy individuals ~5 hours after infusion. The lack of significant effects provides valuable extension of the existing literature, as ketamine's effects might be confined to a more acute time window or differ in clinical populations.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Molecular mechanism(s) of congression are not fully understood. Here we combine live cell microscopy, perturbations of microtubule motor activities, correlative light/electron microscopy, and computational modeling, to quantitatively characterize the early-prometaphase movements that bring the scattered chromosomes to the equator in human RPE1 cells. We find that the early-prometaphase movements are predominantly directed toward the spindle center and not the spindle poles. Centromere velocity of the centripetal movements is not constant with centromeres moving faster at larger distances from the spindle center. We also detect that numerous short microtubules appear at kinetochores at the earliest stages of spindle assembly and prior to chromosome congression. Computational modeling reveals that a mechanism based on brief, stochastic, minus-end directed interactions between the short microtubules protruding from the kinetochores and long appropriately curved microtubules within the spindle accurately predicts the observed distance-velocity function. Further, the model predicts that insufficient numbers of microtubules protruding from the kinetochores decreases the velocity and randomizes directionality of congression movements. These predictions match changes in the chromosome behavior observed in cells with suppressed nucleation of microtubules at the kinetochore corona (RPE1 Rod{Delta}/{Delta}). In contrast, predictions of computational models based on continuous pulling forces at kinetochores differ significantly from the experimental observations. Together, live-cell observations and modeling reveal a novel mechanism that enables the efficient and synchronized arrival of chromosomes to the spindle equator.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Hippocampal neurons have been repeatedly found to be an effected cell type for these disorders. To directly probe the effect of disruption of the epigenetic machinery, we established a murine neuronal hippocampal differentiation model which allows rapid and systemic knockout (KO) of diverse epigenetic machinery (EM) factors. This system allows us to interrogate the consequences of each KO using ONT DNA methylation sequencing and RNA sequencing. Upon KO of KMT2A (a histone methyltransferase) or DNMT1 (a DNA methyltransferase), we observed a striking convergence in gene expression. In contrast, KO of DNMT1 lead to extensive changes in DNA methylation whereas KO of KMT2A had little-to-no effect on DNA methylation. In both models, KO accelerated neuronal differentiation, and the convergence in gene expression appeared linked to this differentiation state. The transcription factor GSX1 was differentially methylated, differentially expressed and ~20% of its known down-stream targets were differentially expressed genes. Extending our methylation analysis to 46 EM genes, we found that loss of DNA methyltransferases caused the most profound DNAm alterations, whereas other genes induced more subtle effects. Clustering of promoter DNAm changes revealed two EM subgroups that collectively showed a marked enrichment of interactions with the DNAm machinery. Through allele-specific phasing, we identified a differentially methylated region (DMR) at Zic4 that was shared across the entire group of EM KOs, as well as 1074 haplotype-specific DMRs.

While the synaptic role of Nrxn1 role is well studied, its impact on network dynamics and decision-making behavior remain unclear. Using widefield calcium imaging, we assess cortex-wide activity in mice performing a two-choice task to probe how priors influence visually-guided decisions. This task requires the mouse to combine sensory evidence with the prior probability over the stimulus side. We find Nrxn1 KO mice underutilized priors and were slower to update choices based on feedback. During decision-making, cortex-wide cortical activity is both elevated and increasingly correlated in Nrxn1 KO mice, independent of task period. Moreover, a larger fraction of cortical variance was explained by movement variables, consistent with stronger coupling of cortical activity to motor signals and a bias toward movement-related dynamics. These findings suggest that core computations underlying decision-making, such as integrating past experience with current evidence, depend on intact synaptic mechanisms shaped by genes like Nrxn1.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

We show how this can be caused by variable amounts of statistical information between variants, e.g. due to variable sample sizes, which arise widely in meta-analyses, or due to variable imputation accuracy or call rate. This effect becomes more pronounced as sample sizes become larger, such that small differences in information available at different variants can lead to large errors in credible set predictions. Here, we show this inaccuracy propagates to the colocalisation method coloc, yielding confident but incorrect inference. We propose an adaptation of the proportional colocalisation test, which avoids any fine-mapping inference as an alternative to fine- mapping based colocalisation. This method was originally superseded by coloc because the null hypothesis is colocalisation, and because it can have low power in genetic regions with many variants. Our adaptation resolves this second issue, and simulations demonstrate that our approach accurately resolves false coloc inferences. However, the first issue remains, such that we suggest proportional colocalisation is used as an accompaniment to fine- mapping-based coloc. Our findings also emphasize the need for new methodologies in fine- mapping, particularly as GWAS sample sizes grow, to ensure accurate fine-mapping inference.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Proteins are inherently dynamic, interconverting among conformational states that govern their function. Perturbations such as mutations, ligand binding, and pH changes modulate these dynamics and are implicated in many diseases. While cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has transformed structure determination, it typically yields an averaged density map representing a static snapshot. A central challenge remains capturing the thermodynamics underlying protein motions and corresponding structural fingerprints that modulate function. CryoPhold enables Bayesian reweighting of AlphaFold-generated structural ensembles against experimental cryo-EM maps, generating posterior structural ensembles that are consistent with experimental data while preserving conformational heterogeneity. Molecular simulations seeded from the posterior ensemble capture time-dependent dynamics, while machine learning models trained on featurized molecular simulation data identify structural fingerprints (\"hotspots\") that modulate protein dynamics. Finally, Markov state models trained on featurized molecular simulation data quantify metastable state populations and free-energy landscapes. By integrating a generative AI-based protein structure prediction model, experimental cryo-EM density, physics-based sampling, and machine learning, CryoPhold enables dynamics paradigm to capture biomolecular motion. The workflow enables prediction of equilibrium populations and structural fingerprints governing conformational dynamics in human transporter protein, GlyT1.

On/Off and counterphase flicker elicited responses at the expected fundamental frequency (3 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively) and their harmonics. Manipulating phase relationships modulated these response patterns, including a reduction in the fundamental amplitude for On/Off flicker. The data were modeled with a series of binocular combination algorithms, ranging in complexity from a simple linear sum to a two-stage binocular gain-control model with parallel monocular and binocular phase-selective channels. The model required parallel monocular channels to account for our data, whereas phase selectivity was not essential.

However, these constructs still lack the bioactivity required for robust and spatially uniform bone integration, particularly within the implant core. To address this limitation, we developed a bioactive, cell-free strategy that integrates porous titanium implants with a nanofibrillar peptide-hyaluronic acid scaffold, delivered either as a hydrogel or in lyophilized form. The scaffold exhibited enhanced enzymatic stability and supported osteoblast-like cell adhesion in vitro. In a rabbit calvarial critical-size bone defect model, scaffold-integrated implants significantly outperformed inert controls, with hydrogel integration nearly doubling inner bone volume and improving trabecular architecture.

Using new genetically encoded probes to measure the permeability of the cell in situ at the single-cell level, we discovered that the size threshold determining whether proteins can pass through the Bacillus subtilis sacculus is smaller than was previously thought. We found that transport of small proteins (<10 kDa) through the sacculus was consistent with passive diffusion through discrete pores, while larger proteins (>15 kDa) required the generation of larger pores by inducing peptidoglycan hydrolysis unbalanced by synthesis. These data are consistent with physics-based models of diffusion through a random percolation network of finite thickness. Conversely, the ability of the innate immune factor phospholipase (15.2 kDa) to kill B. subtilis was inhibited by membrane de-polarization. The protective effect of de-polarization was dependent on latent peptidoglycan synthesis (decoupled from cell growth) by PBP1 - highlighting a new role for this enzyme - and on reduced peptidoglycan hydrolysis. These results demonstrate that the rapid peptidoglycan turnover that drives cell growth also promotes movement of phospholipase across the cell wall, identifying a quintessentially bacterial mechanism of active transport.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

This kind of functional plasticity gives rise to habituation to pharmacological interventions (resulting in loss of efficacy over time), sensitization (resulting in unacceptable side effects after repeated use), or canalizing of undesired dynamics that recur even when the original problem has been resolved (persistent disease states). Our in silico analyses reveal that memories formed in gene regulatory networks can be erased by specific further experiences without any changes of network topology (leaving the connectivity in place).

One of the reasons is the redundancy aspects, as there are multiple H3K9 methylation reader molecules, including HP1, and HP1 itself functions as a hub recruiting various effector molecules. To overcome those issues, we took a synthetic biology approach and introduced H3K9 methylation and HP1 into budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which does not have this system, and examined its impact on transcription and chromatin compaction. We observed that the mammalian H3K9 methyltransferase can induce genome-wide H3K9 di- and tri-methylation (H3K9me2,3) in the budding yeast which mainly in the gene body region, and HP1 accumulates over the H3K9 methylated regions. The forced expression of H3K9 methyltransferase and HP1 had little impact on transcription. Furthermore, Micro-C-seq analysis revealed no significant effects on the chromatin 3D structure.

The immature life stages of mosquitoes share the same habitat with a variety of microorganisms in aquatic environments. To better understand the microbial diversity in field-derived Ae. aegypti, we analysed simultaneously collected larvae, pupae, and freshly emerged adults from Burkina Faso together with their breeding water via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We observed a decrease in bacterial diversity and load across the mosquito life stages. At the phylum level, a strong increase in relative abundance of Proteobacteria was found along the mosquito stages. The same 40 amplicon sequence variants were consistently found as most abundant in the adults, regardless of the sample collection site, and all belonged to the Gammaproteobacteria. Our data suggests that these bacteria were not randomly derived by chance from the environment in the mosquito but rather deposited by a female mosquito during oviposition, a transmission route recently coined as ''diagonal transmission''. Indeed, our results indicated that there is a selection of Gammaproteobacteria from the breeding water and that these bacterial members are further maintained from larvae to adult. This study provided new data on the microbiome composition of field-captured Ae. aegypti, contributing to an enhanced understanding of the origin and colonization route of the mosquito microbiome, potentially via a diagonal transmission route. Importance The past decades the world has experienced a vast increase in epidemics of pathogenic infections transmitted by vectors. These pathogens can cause severe diseases such as haemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and arthritis. For instance, several arboviruses, such as chikungunya virus, Zika virus, and dengue virus, pose significant global health threats because of their high disease burden, their widespread (re-)emergence and the lack of (good) anti-arboviral strategies. Despite the clear burden, current vector control strategies are clearly insufficient. A promising strategy is the usage of microorganisms to tackle vector-borne transmission. However, a better fundamental understanding of their functioning in the vector is needed. Particularly, how microorganisms in the field develop inside the insect body and are transmitted between different life stages remains intensively debated. We addressed this knowledge gap by studying the mosquito microbiome in African Aedes aegypti mosquitoes at different sampling locations, ranging over different mosquito life stages, and including the environmental water.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Flagella are trans-envelope nanomachines expressed from genes organized in a complex regulatory hierarchy governed at the highest level by transcription factors called master activators. The master activator of flagellar biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis is a hybrid of SwrA*DegU that is required to increase flagellar density to swarm over solid surfaces. Here we show that the ClpX unfoldase subunit of the ClpP protease is required for swarming motility, and that cells mutated for ClpX fail to swarm due to restricted levels of both SwrA and DegU. Suppressor mutations were found that increased expression of the fla/che operon under SwrA*DegU control, and mutation of the LonA protease elevates the levels of SwrA protein while mutation of the global transcriptional regulator Spx increases transcription of both the degU and swrA genes. We conclude that ClpX promotes swarming motility via degradation of Spx, which represses motility gene transcription including the Pfla/che, PdegU, and PswrA promoters each activated by DegU. The ClpX-dependent regulatory proteolysis of Spx is relieved upon stress conditions, and we infer that Spx may dampen DegU-mediated positive feedback to limit cell envelope stress caused by excessive flagellar biosynthesis.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

However, biogas exceeding storage capacity is typically flared, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. To address this issue, we focused on halophilic methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) capable of converting methane into ectoine, a high-value compatible solute widely used in more than 400 cosmetic active ingredients and valued at approximately US$1,000/kg. Nevertheless, research on halophilic methanotrophs and ectoine biosynthesis remains limited. Here, we report the successful isolation of the Type I methanotroph Methylotuvimicrobium percolatum from activated sludge in a brackish water environment. Complete genome sequencing revealed genes for methane oxidation, osmoadaptation, and notably the ectABCask cluster responsible for ectoine biosynthesis. Activity tests under varying NaCl concentrations confirmed ectoine production, with a maximum yield of 20.1 mg ectoine/g-DCW achieved at 25% methane, 30 degrees Celsius, and 3 wt% salinity. Biomass growth remained robust up to 6% salinity but declined sharply at higher NaCl concentrations, indicating that optimal conditions for growth and ectoine synthesis do not entirely coincide. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of halophilic methanotroph physiology and highlight their potential as sustainable platforms for converting surplus methane from AD processes into commercially valuable ectoine.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) utilizes acetogens as biocatalysts to reduce CO2 and produce commodity chemicals using electricity. However, limited electron supply in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) aggravates the poor cell growth of acetogens resulting in low productivities. Formate is a soluble C1 feedstock that can be produced by CO2 reduction (1). Thus, assimilation of formate can unburden the amount of electrons required for MES. Acetobacterium woodii posseses multiple pyruvate formate lyase (PFL) genes that are upregulated during formatotrophic growth. In this study, Clostridium ljugdahlii was engineered to heterologously express a pfl geneset of A. woodii to increase the cell growth of C. ljungdahlii during microbial electrosynthesis. Different combinations of pfl A and pfl B from A. woodii were tested in C. ljungdahlii to find the best working combination under control of Pfdx-riboswitch expression system. Expression of pfl B1 and pflA of A. woodii showed higher maximum OD of C. ljugdahlii under H2:CO2 condition with supplementation of 80 mM sodium formate. More than 40 mM of sodium formate caused significantly longer lag phase but the lag phase could be shortened after adaptation in 80 mM of sodium formate. At the end, the engineered strain showed improved cell growth (ODmax 0.22 {+/-} 0.05) and acetate production (21.8 {+/-} 5.6 mM) during microbial electrosynthesis compared to the control strain (ODmax 0.10 {+/-} 0.06 and 10.2 {+/-} 2.5 mM acetate).

Human cells were exposed to a H2O2 titration series to induce oxidative stress or to tumor necrosis factor- to induce inflammation over a time course, followed by RNA direct nanopore sequencing of cytosolic and mitochondrial rRNAs. The guanosine (G) oxidation sites and deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) and cytidine to uridine (C-to-U) lesion sites were revealed by changes in the base-called data. Both stressors induced G oxidation in cytosolic rRNA, whereas mitochondrial rRNA was less oxidatively modified. Nitrosative stress generated during inflammation resulted in deamination lesions in rRNAs in both compartments. Inspection of highly modified sites showed the GC-rich tentacles in the 28S rRNA sequence were hotspots for G oxidation and C deamination in the cytosolic ribosome. Outside of tentacles, lesions were generally found on nucleotides on the ribosome surface exposed to solvent, where diffusible reactive species exist. The minimalist structure of the mitochondrial ribosome compared to the cytosolic ribosome alters the reaction patterns observed to target nucleotides on the surface or in functionally relevant regions. These patterns support the hypothesis that tentacles in cytosolic ribosomes direct reactive oxygen and nitrogen species away from the catalytic core to maintain ribosome activity during stress, while the mitochondrial ribosome is damaged in regions that can deactivate protein synthesis. The results provide molecular insight into metabolic dysfunction during oxidative and inflammatory stress and suggest a new function for the GC-rich tentacles that have evolved in mammalian cells.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

SARM1 plays a central role in this process by degrading NAD+ into nicotinamide and ADPR or cADPR. SARM1 also catalyzes a base exchange reaction between NAD+-phosphate (NADP+) and nicotinic acid (NA) to generate NAADP. These second messengers (i.e., ADPR, cADPR, and NAADP), and NAD+ consumption, are thought to drive axon degeneration. Herein, we identify a fourth reaction catalyzed by SARM1: mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation). Specifically, we show that SARM1 MARylates itself and other proteins with a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) higher than its NAD+ hydrolase activity. We further show that auto-MARylation promotes a phase transition and renders SARM1 responsive to regulation by NMN. Notably, endogenous SARM1 is MARylated at mitochondria, suggesting that MARylation may regulate SARM1 localization.

Moreover, most scFvs used in the CAR field are of non-human origin, potentially causing immunogenicity. Therefore, we established an engineering platform for minimalistic CAR binding domains (miniCARbids), which combine several critical advantages: (i) human origin, (ii) small size, (iii) efficient expression in T cells and (iv) single-domain architecture, among others. We demonstrate that miniCARbids can be engineered to recognize various antigens with antibody-like affinities, while being stable and aggregation-resistant. When miniCARbids are incorporated into CARs, they induce high anti-tumor potency in both adapter and conventional CAR formats. Remarkably, CD22-directed miniCARbid-based CARs showed similar or even more efficient tumor clearance in leukemia-bearing mice when compared with a CAR comprising the clinically tested m971-1xG4S scFv.

To investigate this restriction in the context of virus attachment to the airway epithelium, we comprehensively analyzed the glycome of human nasal and tracheal epithelial cells. Using a synthetic N-glycan library that reflects the structural diversity of the human airway glycome, we found that only bi-antennary N-glycans with extended human-type receptors on at least one branch serve as receptors for the recent H3 hemagglutinins (HAs). Such receptors are found on tracheal epithelium but are deficient in nasal epithelium. Immunofluorescence analysis on human trachea reveals that recent H3 HAs preferentially attach to ciliated cells, consistent with single-cell RNA sequencing analysis indicating that these cells express glycosyltransferases that produce extended glycan chains.

These structures reveal a series of active, intermediate, and inactive states that illustrate a detailed activation mechanism. The crRNA undergoes dramatic conformational changes upon target RNA binding, with the helical-1 domain transitioning from an initially docked state with the N-terminal domain to an allosterically switched conformation that stabilizes the RNA duplex.

However, it remains unclear whether copper-coordinating residues are more prone to oxidation than non-coordinating ones, and how their susceptibility changes between the apo and copper-bound states. The copper chaperone PcuC, important for cytochrome c oxidase assembly in bacteria, contains a canonical binding site composed of two histidines and two methionines (H51xnM63x22H86xM88), as well as a disordered C-terminal extension enriched in methionine and histidine. To quantify methionine oxidation sensitivity in both apo- and Cu-bound PcuC, we used a methionine-specific oxaziridine probe combined with mass spectrometry and compared labeling patterns to those generated by 18O-labeled hydrogen peroxide. We show that methionine residues display distinct oxidation sensitivities in the apoprotein, and that the oxaziridine reacts similarly to H218O2. Importantly, this probe enables quantification of methionine oxidation independently of hydroxyl radicals generated by copper-driven Fenton chemistry, which lacks residue specificity. In the copper-bound form, Cu binding strongly alters methionine reactivity, with a marked increase in oxidation of the coordinating Met63 and Met88. Structural analysis revealed that two copper ions occupy the canonical site, while the C-terminal extension does not contribute to coordination. Comparison of structural features and oxidation sensitivity showed that methionine susceptibility correlates with solvent exposure in the folded domain, but with local positive charge in the disordered region. These findings demonstrate that copper coordination modulates methionine oxidation, and that oxaziridine-based probes provide a powerful tool for mapping oxidation sensitivity in (metallo)proteins.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

It is unclear how the dimeric structures induced by synthetic agonists and mutations relate to one another, and whether any of these induce the same active structure as the native ligand Tpo, yet this has important implications both for fundamental cytokine receptor biology and for development of targeted interventions for hTpoR-driven myeloproliferative diseases. Here we used deep mutational scanning (DMS) across the TM and juxtamembrane (JM) regions of hTpoR to extract feature-rich sequence-function signatures across a variety of different activating contexts. While each displayed some unique features, synthetic agonists and activating mutations all exhibited strong dependence on a common TM interface that is consistent with previous models of a left-handed, near-parallel helix dimer with H499 facing lipid. In contrast, Tpo-mediated activation was broadly insensitive to TM-JM substitutions, indicating that it does not rely on the same interface. Modeling with AlphaFold 3 (AF3) consistently yielded a right-handed, splayed helix dimer that is close at the extracellular face, contains H499 in the interface and diverges toward the cytosolic face, resting on an intracellular amphipathic JM helix that lies parallel to the membrane, which is also observed in a DMS/AF3 analysis of human erythropoietin receptor. This splayed Tpo-bound dimer could be stably inserted into a lipid bilayer with associated JAK2 using molecular dynamics and is supported by experiments showing that most or all of the TM domain can be replaced by poly-valine, with little effect on Tpo-driven activation but catastrophic effects on responses to synthetic ligands.

Osteoclastogenesis is regulated by local environmental cues, including paracrine factors released by resident cell populations. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently emerged as key mediators of paracrine communication, though their role in osteoclastogenesis remains underexplored. Therefore, this study investigated how resident mesenchymal-derived bone cells and their secreted EVs modulate osteoclastogenesis, and delineate the signalling factors mediating this anti-catabolic communication. We demonstrate that the secretome of mesenchymal-derived bone cells inhibit osteoclast differentiation to differing degrees depending on the stage of lineage commitment and on the mechanical environment, and demonstrate that this inhibition is mediated via the release of EVs. In addition, we identified the terminally differentiated osteocyte as the optimal parent cell for the production of anti-catabolic EVs and demonstrated the importance EV dosage.

We demonstrate how ParTIpy can be used to study intra-cell-type gene expression variability through the lens of task allocation, offering a principled alternative to methods that impose discrete cell state classifications on inherently continuous variation. Availability and implementation: ParTIpy's open-source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/saezlab/ParTIpy) and pypi (https://pypi.org/project/partipy). Documentation is available at https://partipy.readthedocs.io.

Dynamic structures of lens sutures have been hypothesized to act as pathways carrying fluid containing ions, nutrients, and other factors as part of microcirculation for maintaining lens homeostasis and transparency. 3D imaging results show both typical \"Y\" and \"double Y\" shaped suture structures in WT lenses, diverse suture patterns including \"star\" shapes with variations appearing at different depths, and misaligned suture planes in KLPH-KO lenses. The variability in suture patterns, quantified using the mean of image stacks' similarity indices (SSIM) to the mean projection of the stack, reveals a significant increase (p<0.05) in pattern randomization for KLPH-KO lenses. Both WT and KLPH-KO lenses exhibit voids around sutures and enlarged vacuoles throughout the lens structure in vivo. Pathological features like irregular and larger central voids containing 2~5-m-diameter amorphous structures that might result from membrane protein remnants/aggregates in the KLPH-KO mouse eye lens were observed. In conclusion, this work provides new morphological markers for characterizing suture cataract and fiber pathological features. Lens sutures are stabilized structures that are impermeable to dyes, and the extracellular spaces of lens peripheral fibers provide efficient diffusion pathways for lens microcirculation.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Applied to modeling primary and lung metastatic breast cancer, SITE revealed tissue-specific tumor-host interactions and ERK signaling patterns linked to distinct single-cell behaviors. We found that multicellular niche formation involved active protrusion and cell-cell contact driven by both cancer and host cells. Mathematical modeling showed ERK signaling was co-influenced by neighboring cancer and host cells. Paracrine signaling among cancer cells increased signaling in a cluster size-dependent manner, while disruption of cancer-cancer signaling loops amplified tissue-specific differences in tumor architecture.

This study investigated whether respiratory measurements could serve as predictive, non-invasive tools for BSFL performance on diets differing in protein-to-carbohydrate (P:C) ratio. Larvae were reared for seven days on four experimental diets, with growth, survival, gas exchange (O2 consumption, CO2 production, respiratory exchange ratio (RER)), and body composition (crude protein and lipid contents) measured across seven replicates per treatment. O2 consumption correlated strongly with final larval biomass, while RER was closely associated with protein and lipid deposition. Larvae on low-protein, high-carbohydrate diets accumulated proportionally more lipid, whereas protein-rich diets increased crude protein content but required higher energetic investment. This demonstrates that lipid-rich larvae grew more efficient in energetic terms per unit accumulated biomass than protein-rich larvae. Across diets, gas exchange variables reliably reflected growth dynamics, metabolic activity, and nutrient assimilation. Integrating respirometry into rearing systems could enable real-time monitoring of insect biomass yield and nutrient composition.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

To advance the understanding of its pathogenesis and support therapeutic discovery, we developed a comprehensive knowledgebase in the form of a Molecular Interaction Map (MIM). Methods: Differential expression analysis was performed on peripheral blood samples from SjD patients and healthy controls across three datasets: GSE51092 (190 SjD vs 32 controls), UKPSSR (151 SjD vs 29 controls) and PRECISESADS (304 SjD vs 341 controls). Pathway enrichment analyses provided guidance for MIM construction, which was further refined through literature mining to integrate data-driven results with curated knowledge. Results: A total of 1,625 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified: 725 from PRECISESADS, 1,162 from GSE51092, and 239 from UKPSSR, with 25 DEGs shared across all three datasets. Among these, nine common DEGs were associated with interferon signalling, reinforcing experimental evidence pointing to its pivotal role in SjD. Enrichment analyses revealed 146 pathways, 43 of which were successfully incorporated into the MIM. The resulting SjD Map freely accessible at https://sjdmap.elixir-luxembourg.org/, comprises 829 molecular entities connected by 598 interactions, with 45% of the information depicted supported by transcriptomic data and 47% derived from literature.

F.; Gollisch, T.; Ecker, A. S.", "abstract": "Wide-field amacrine cells (ACs) play a unique role in retinal processing by integrating visual information across a large spatial area. Their inhibitory influence has been implicated in multiple retinal functions such as differential motion detection and the suppression of retinal activity during eye movements. However, a coherent understanding of their general function is lacking due to difficulties in directly recording from these cells and identifying effective visual stimuli to activate them. In this study, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to investigate wide-field inhibition mediated by wide-field ACs in the marmoset retina. We trained CNNs to mimic the function of the retina by predicting retinal ganglion cell (RGC) population responses to naturalistic movie stimuli and optimising the most exciting inputs (MEIs) to visualise RGCs' receptive field (RF) structures. We then optimized suppressive surrounds beyond classical RGC RF boundaries, intended to capture the inhibitory effect of wide-field ACs on RGC activity. These optimized surrounds reduced MEI-elicited activity by 10% to 30%, demonstrating that CNNs not only mimic retinal responses but can also reveal hidden computational aspects of wide-field inhibition. However, suppression strength and generalization varied across architectures and datasets, indicating potential model-specific effects, highlighting the importance of cautious interpretation. Overall, our approach illustrates how interpretability methods applied to artificial neural networks can offer new hypotheses regarding biological retinal computation, paving the way for targeted experimental validation.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

We confirm that cDC1, cDC2 and mregDC represent the major DC populations present in human tumours, and that these populations are highly conserved regardless of cancer type. A distinct DC3 population was not identified within the atlas, suggesting these cells are less distinguishable in tumour tissue. The cDC2 compartment resolved into two subpopulations, a minor population that aligned tumour associated CD207CD1A cDC2 with splenic cDC2A, and a predominate subset aligning with cDC2B.

Closely related species within the Cholerae clade, Vibrio paracholerae, Vibrio metoecus, and Vibrio tarriae, were long misclassified as non-O1/O139 V. cholerae. The objective of this study was to analyze all 13,000+ available V. cholerae genomes in GenBank to determine the presence of species from the Cholerae clade. Genome-wide analyses using Mash, Whole-genome based Average Nucleotide Identity (gANI), and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) reclassified 193 unique genomes as V. paracholerae, while V. metoecus and V. tarriae were not identified. Phylogenomic analyses revealed that V. paracholerae forms distinct but relatively homogeneous lineages, spanning clinical, environmental, and animal sources over a period of more than a century. Virulence profiling revealed the absence of CTX and TCP; however, most genomes exhibited other virulence factors, including hemolysins, RTX toxins, colix toxin, and a conserved type VI secretion system. Resistome analysis revealed several antibiotic resistance genes, many of which were incorporated into superintegrons, highlighting the role of V. paracholerae as a reservoir of resistance determinants. Importantly, two genomic markers exhibited high discriminatory power for species identification, providing robust tools for epidemiological surveillance.

Assembly of these motors is facilitated by the molecular chaperone HSP90, its co-chaperone RUVBL1-RUVBL2 and adaptor proteins such as CCDC103 (aka DNAAF19). Mutations in CCDC103 identified in PCD patients impair dynein assembly, contributing to the disease pathology. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human RUVBL1-RUVBL2-CCDC103 complex at 3.2 angstrom resolution, a chaperone assembly we refer to as R2C. It comprises a hetero-hexameric RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ring bound to three CCDC103 molecules via their RUVBL2-binding domains (RBDs), which have additional functions. Unlike RPAP3 of R2TP, a previously defined co-chaperone of HSP90, CCDC103 lacks a PIH1D1-binding motif and TPR domains, but its flexible N-terminal region regulates RUVBL1-RUVBL2 oligomerisation.

Recent studies using the GABABR agonist baclofen have revealed a critical role for these receptors in promoting oligodendroglial differentiation in both health and disease, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we identify a dual role for oligodendroglial GABABR in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Conditional deletion of the GABAB1 subunit in NG2+ cells ameliorates acute disease symptoms while inducing an immune-like phenotype in oligodendrocytes. This immunomodulatory role is further supported by pharmacological activation of GABABR in oligodendrocytes, which reduces the expression of MHC class II in these cells. Notably, baclofen treatment after EAE symptom onset attenuates the course of the disease while enhancing oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation and suppressing T cell infiltration into demyelinating lesions. Moreover, prophylactic baclofen administration delays disease onset and further decreases immune cell recruitment into the spinal cord, underscoring its potent immunomodulatory effect. These data demonstrate that GABABR signaling exerts context-dependent effects on both oligodendrocyte lineage progression and neuroinflammatory responses. Importantly, these compelling findings validate baclofen, a drug already approved for MS-associated spasticity, as a promising candidate for therapies targeting both inflammation and remyelination, advancing our understanding of glial-immune interactions in demyelinating diseases and supporting the translational potential of GABABR modulation in MS.", "date": "2025-09-13", "journal": ""}

Lipids dynamically reside in multiple intracellular locations and their organellar distribution is important for specific interactions and biological function. During brain aging lipid changes have been specifically noted in lysosomes, but the identity of the accumulated lipids, their interactions with other biomolecules such as proteins, and their functional relevance have not been characterized. We used mass spectrometry (MS) to assess longitudinal changes in the lipidome and proteome of lysosomes isolated from the mouse cortex, from the age of 3- to 24-months. Our statistical and machine learning analyses identified two factors demonstrating predictive power for age and differences in both lipids and proteins. Of these, factor 1 was the best predictor of sample age. Factor 1 lipids with the highest feature importance included multiple species of hexosylceramides (HexCer) and their sulfonated derivatives, sulfatides (SHexCer), all of which increased with age. Increased factor 1 proteins included myelin proteins, select sphingolipid catabolism enzymes and proteins associated with lysosomal storage diseases. Our analyses suggested that mechanisms underlying factor 1 encompass the combination of an age-dependent increase in lysosomal delivery of myelin components and alterations in lysosomal sphingolipid catabolism favoring degradation of sphingomyelin over HexCer. The overall age-related lysosomal changes resembled those observed in lysosomal storage diseases, particularly Gaucher disease, where accumulation of HexCer species is associated with lysosomal dysfunction. To corroborate factor 1 predictions, we employed a combination of biochemical, imaging and flow cytometry approaches, which confirmed alterations in sphingolipid catabolism and lysosomal accumulation of myelin components. These changes were associated with age-related alteration in lysosomal morphology, lysosomal dysfunction and inhibition of autophagy in both neurons and microglia.
