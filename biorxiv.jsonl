Using this approach, we have combined data from cell lines treated with either the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor, Roxadustat (FG-4592), or with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, or with a DMSO control, to identify a total of 4,993 and 3,247 proline hydroxylation sites, respectively, in HEK293 and RCC4 cells. A subset of 1,954 (HEK293) and 1,253 (RCC4) non-collagen proline hydroxylation sites with high confidence were inhibited by FG-4592 treatment. Features characteristic of proline hydroxylated peptides were identified, which were consistent between the HEK293 and RCC4 datasets. The more hydrophilic HILIC fractions were enriched in peptides containing hydroxylated proline residues, which showed characteristic differences in charge and mass distribution, as compared with either unmodified, or oxidised peptides. Furthermore, we discovered that the intensity of the diagnostic hydroxyproline immonium ion was dependent upon parameters including the MS collision energy setting, parent peptide concentration and the sequence of amino acids adjacent to the modified proline. We show using synthetic peptides that a combination of retention time in LC and optimised MS parameter settings allows reliable identification of proline hydroxylation sites in peptides, even when multiple prolines residues are present. Focussing on proteins in which newly identified proline hydroxylation sites were inhibited by the pan-PHD inhibitor, FG-4592, showed enrichment for proteins involved in metabolism of RNA, mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation, including the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit, Repo-Man (CDCA2). We show that Repo-Man is hydroxylated at P604 and in the accompanying study, [Druker et al., 2025], we present a combination of cellular and biochemical evidence that hydroxylation of Repo-Man at P604 is important for its function in controlling mitotic progression.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Although the molecular mechanism has been extensively studied, the endogenous contexts of ribosome collision rescued by the system are poorly understood. Here, beginning with a study of the codon specificity of the eukaryotic translation termination factor eRF1, we show that transient binding of eRF1 to the UUA sense codon leads to ribosome collision and provides a constitutive source of rescue substrates in humans. eRF1-selective Monosome-Seq and Disome-Seq revealed that eRF1 was recruited not only to stop codons but also to near-cognate sense codons, including the UUA codon. The eRF1 on UUA codons delays translation elongation but does not trigger the termination reaction. Remarkably, Disome-Seq with the depletion of ASCC3 and 4EHP, key factors for the ribosome rescue and translation initiation repression, showed that ribosomes stalled at UUA codons consist of a subpopulation suppressed by those factors. Failure of ribosome collision repression by ASCC3-4EHP triggers stress response, such as expression of the stress-induced transcription factor ATF3. This study highlights the impact of sense codon misrecognition by the termination factor on translation homeostasis in human cells.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

This study addresses these limitations by evaluating the effectiveness of various physiological measures Pupil Response, Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Heart Rate (HR), Respiration Line Length (RLL) and facial temperature changes in predicting deception using the Comparison Question Test (CQT). It also fills a critical research gap by validating these methods within an Asian context. Employing a between-subjects design, data was collected from a diverse sample of 118 participants from Singapore, including Chinese, Indian, and Malay individuals. The research aims to identify which physiological indicators, in combination, offer the most robust predictions of deceptive behavior. Key innovations include the adaptation of the CQT with a modified directed lie paradigm and an expanded sample size to assess the relative importance of each physiological measure. The study's findings reveal that Pupil Response is the most significant predictor of deception, with EDA enhancing the model's explanatory power. HR, while relevant, adds limited value when combined with Pupil Response and EDA, and facial temperature changes were statistically non-significant. The study highlights the need for further research into the interactions among physiological measures and their application in varied contexts. This research contributes valuable insights into improving deception detection methodologies and sets the stage for future investigations that could incorporate additional physiological indicators and explore real-world applications.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

The pathophysiology of dominant or recessive SLC4A1 variant related dRTA has been linked with the mis trafficking defect of mutant kAE1 protein. However, in vivo studies in kAE1 R607H dRTA mice and humans have revealed a complex pathophysiology implicating a loss of kAE1-expressing intercalated cells and intracellular relocation of the H+-ATPase in the remaining type-A intercalated cells. These cells also displayed accumulation of ubiquitin and p62 autophagy markers. The highly active transport properties of collecting duct cells require the maintenance of cellular energy and homeostasis, a process dependent on intracellular pH. Therefore, we hypothesized that the expression of dRTA variants affect intracellular pH and autophagy pathways. In this study, we report the characterization of newly identified dRTA variants and provide evidence of abnormal autophagy and degradative pathways in mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells and kidneys from mice expressing kAE1 R607H dRTA mutant protein. We show that reduced transport activity of the kAE1 variants correlated with increased cytosolic pH, reduced ATP synthesis, attenuated downstream autophagic pathways pertaining to the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and/or lysosomal degradative activity.

To address this problem, we generated a toolkit of 11 membrane-localising tags that can be screened rapidly in diverse organisms. The toolkit includes tags that target the plasma membrane through different mechanisms, including signal peptides, the attachment of lipids, and fusion with lipid-binding domains. Each tag has been fused to the red fluorescent protein mScarlet3 and placed downstream of a T7 promoter, allowing the in vitro production of mRNA that can be readily delivered in a wide range of embryos and cells of interest.

Gene trees often differ from species trees due to factors like incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and gene duplication and loss (GDL). Quartet-based species tree estimation methods have gained substantial popularity for their accuracy and statistical guarantee. %To address ILS, accurate species tree estimation methods, such as ASTRAL, TREE-QMC, and wQFM-TREE, have been developed. However, most of these methods (e.g., ASTRAL, wQFM, wQMC) rely on single-copy gene trees and models ILS and not GDL, limiting their applicability to large genomic datasets. ASTRAL-Pro, a recent advancement, has refined quartet similarity measures to incorporate both orthology and paralogy, improving species tree inference under GDL. Among other quartet-based methods, wQFM-DISCO converts multicopy gene family trees into single-copy gene trees using DISCO and applies the wQFM algorithm on the single-copy trees. However, ASTRAL-Pro has remained the only quartet-based summary method to explicitly model gene duplication and loss. In this study, we extend both wQFM (which requires quartet decomposition) and wQFM-TREE (which operates directly on gene trees) by modeling gene duplication and loss, leveraging the concept of speciation-driven quartets introduced in ASTRAL-Pro.

We extended the classic item-specific proportion congruency paradigm to dissociate the electroencephalographic (EEG) representations of controlled and non-controlled associations. Behavioral data replicated previous findings of association-driven adaptive behaviors. Decoding analyses of EEG data further showed that associations of controlled and non-controlled information were represented concurrently and differentially.

Here, we introduce a modular piezoelectric ultrasound stimulation platform that integrates seamlessly with conventional multi-well plates, enabling selective neuromodulation of midbrain organoids (mBOs). We demonstrate that ultrasound can specifically modulate cellular differentiation by promoting dopaminergic progenitor markers while delaying terminal differentiation.

The purpose of this study was to develop a novel biomaterial-based method to collect murine synovial fluid and elucidate onset mechanism of OA with acute synovitis and chronic mechanical stress. Method: Twelve-week-old C57BL/6J males (n = 72) were divided to the ACL-Transection (ACL-T), ACL-rupture (ACL-R), and Intact groups. We performed joint instability test and histological analysis for cartilage degeneration and synovitis at 2, 6, and 10 weeks. Real time PCR was conducted for articular cartilage at 2 weeks and synovium at 2, 6, and 10 weeks. Tetra-slime was injected into the knee joint and solidified slime including synovial fluid was analyzed in digital PCR at 2 weeks. Results: No difference was observed in joint instability between both ACL injury models. Unlike the Control and ACL-R groups, acute synovitis and secondary cartilage degeneration were induced in the ACL-T group at 2 weeks. The ACL-T group also exhibited an increase of Mmp-3, Tnf-a, Ifn-g, and inos in synovium, and miR145-5p and miR149-5p in synovial fluid compared to the ACL-R group.

When performing differential analysis for a given dataset, relevant information from another platform or species is often available. Incorporating such prior information can help identify features that show consistent differential patterns across platforms or species, which are more likely to reflect shared biological processes, and thereby enhance the robustness and generalizability of the findings. However, existing differential analysis methods typically analyze only the data from the current study and do not leverage prior knowledge about the magnitude or direction of changes from other platforms or species. We address this challenge, and the associated multiple testing problem, using a Bayesian framework that enables the incorporation of prior knowledge obtained from different platforms or species. We propose a new test statistic, Bayesian Credible Ratio (BCR), based on a heteroscedastic global local shrinkage prior, and a new multiple testing criterion, sign-adjusted FDR (SFDR), that emphasize information regarding the direction of the differentially features. We prove that BCR achieves the largest count of sign-based true positives among all legitimate SFDR-controlling methods.

Each has extensive research showing their influence on the development and maintenance of addiction, but the degree to which they drive escalation in cocaine self-administration is poorly understood. Using self-administration, intravenous noncontingent infusions, and pose-estimation machine vision, we find that incentive salience, not psychomotor sensitization or tolerance, drives the escalation of cocaine self-administration in heterogenous stock rats. Individual differences in psychomotor sensitization or tolerance were found to have no effect on cocaine intake. Incentive salience as measured by locomotion and active lever entrances per meter traveled occurring before the self-administration session began (pre-lever activity measures) during Short Access (2-hours) was found to predict intake during Long Access (6-hours). Both pre-lever locomotion and active lever entrances per meter were found to increase during Long Access and after two-to-three days of abstinence. Critically, rats with low pre-lever activity during Short Access escalated both their intake and pre-lever measures by the end of Long Access to levels comparable with high pre-lever activity rats who maintained their elevated responding. These findings support the notion that incentive salience during Short Access is a catalyst to escalated use and an early marker of addiction vulnerability. Moreover, they suggest that individuals initially resistant to incentive salience can, with sufficient exposure, become sensitized and escalate cocaine use to the same level as more susceptible individuals. Analysis of pre-lever activity offers a novel longitudinal behavioral marker to predict vulnerability and provides a framework for understanding individual trajectories of addiction.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Cocaine disrupts gut barriers in animal models, potentially enabling microbial translocation and inflammation in the periphery and central nervous system (CNS), but its direct role in inducing inflammation remains controversial. This study aimed to determine if the oral cavity is a source of circulating microbial DNA translocation in individuals with current cocaine use disorder (COC). Results. A cross-sectional case-control study was conducted, comparing COC and demographically matched non-drug controls. Ten COC (via smoking or vaping) and 24 controls provided paired saliva and blood samples. Microbial 16S rRNA V4 region was sequenced in isolated microbial DNA from saliva and plasma. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was analyzed in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Saliva from COC, but not plasma, exhibited reduced alpha diversity and altered beta diversity, characterized by enriched Streptococcus and depleted Fusobacterium, Neisseria, and other taxa relative to controls. Controls exhibited low to undetectable microbial translocation in plasma. By contrast, plasma Streptococcus and several S. species displayed COC-specific oral enrichment and evidence of translocation into the bloodstream. In vitro, cocaine selectively enhanced S. parasanguinis growth, consistent with COC-enriched oral pathobionts and translocation into circulation in vivo. S. parasanguinis, but not cocaine alone, induced IL-1{beta} and TNF- production in human primary monocytes. scRNAseq further revealed innate immune activation, impaired T cell function, and heightened susceptibility to infection in COC. Conclusions. This is the first study demonstrating that COC via smoking or snorting exhibited oral microbial dysbiosis and selective oral-to-blood microbial translocation in vivo.

While tumor non-autonomous effects on peripheral organs are recognized, how the tumor rewires the circulating immune cells and hematopoiesis remains unclear. We utilized a Drosophila larval cancer cachexia model by expressing yki3SA in the adult midgut precursors (AMP), which gives rise to a tumor in the larval midgut and recapitulates key cachectic phenotypes, including insulin resistance. Tumor-induced cachexia results in perturbed blood cell homeostasis with a reduced niche and aberrant blood cell differentiation in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland (LG). Bulk RNA-seq analysis of circulating hemocytes from tumor-bearing larvae revealed upregulation of multiple cachectic ligands, notably ImpL2, an insulin antagonist. We demonstrate that elevated ImpL2 levels reduce LG niche size and promote aberrant blood cell differentiation. Elevated ImpL2 levels and systemic insulin resistance in the tumor-induced cachexia conditions result in abrogation of insulin signaling in the niche-progenitor micro-environment in the LG. DE-cadherin levels in the primary LG lobe are perturbed, and Wingless signaling is down-regulated, driving prohemocyte differentiation. A genetic mimic of systemic ImpL2 overexpression or high sugar diet (HSD) conditions recapitulates these LG phenotypes due to abrogation of the Insulin-Wingless signaling axis. Hemocyte-specific ImpL2 depletion in HSD-fed larvae rescued these defects, suggesting a regulatory role for circulating hemocyte-derived ImpL2.

We identify a prophage-encoded small RNA (sRNA), HnrS, that functions as an anti-silencing factor by targeting the H-NS paralogue Hha. HnrS is a short (66-nt) sRNA present in multiple copies (up to nine) in EHEC and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) genomes and is enriched in E. coli strains that carry the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE).

This counter-silencing de-represses the LEE type III secretion system and concomitantly represses motility. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that HnrS indirectly activates genes involved in nitrate/nitrite respiration and nitric oxide resistance, metabolic pathways that contribute to survival in the inflamed gastrointestinal tract. Deletion of hnrS reduced expression of nitrate reductase genes and impaired actin pedestal formation on host epithelial cells. Our results indicate that prophage-encoded, multicopy hnrS provides a counter-silencing mechanism that reduces Hha-H-NS repression at specific virulence loci. This likely enables expression of horizontally acquired genes without broadly disrupting the core H-NS regulon. HnrS illustrates how mobile genetic elements deploy sRNAs to counteract xenogenic silencing and promote virulence gene expression, enhancing colonisation of the host.\n\nImportance statementHorizontally acquired genes are often silenced to protect bacterial genomes, but this defence also limits the expression of new traits. We identify a prophage-encoded small RNA, HnrS, that counteracts this restriction by repressing the xenogenic silencer Hha, lifting Hha-H-NS-mediated repression of virulence and metabolic genes. HnrS activates the locus of enterocyte effacement, nitrate/nitrite respiration, and nitric oxide resistance--pathways that help E. coli survive and colonise the inflamed gut. Our findings reveal an RNA-based counter-silencing mechanism encoded by mobile genetic elements, showing how phages can reprogram bacterial regulatory networks to promote adaptation and pathogenicity.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence suggests that disruption of the epigenome may be one of the most critical consequences of prenatal brain exposure to hypoxia3-8. However, the cell-type-selective effects of hypoxia on the developing brain's transcriptome and epigenome remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that immediately after hypoxia, transcriptional and chromatin disruptions occur in all cell types, consistent with the energy deficit dynamics caused by prenatal hypoxia. Unexpectedly, we identify a selective dissociation of transcriptional and chromatin regulation in glutamatergic neurons after hypoxia. Genes neighboring sites of differential chromatin accessibility, but not differential gene expression, correlate with structural and functional deficits in glutamatergic neurons one month after the injury. Our approach reveals novel, shared, and cell-type-specific changes that reflect potential short- and long-term consequences of the hypoxic response. Together, these data provide insight into the mechanisms that lead to lasting changes in the epigenome following an injury to the developing brain, resulting in long-term functional deficits.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

S.; Lax, E.", "abstract": "Prenatal maternal stress (PNS) is a common early-life adversity. PNS has been linked to greater vulnerability to chronic pain in the offspring. PNS results in increased hypersensitivity after Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, a common rodent model for chronic neuropathic pain. These behavioral effects are accompanied by altered levels of enzymes that regulate DNA methylation in the frontal cortex. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group onto cytosine bases of cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites in the genome, is an epigenetic mechanism by which life experiences can reprogram gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify differentially methylated regions that might contribute to the increased pain sensitivity following nerve injury in adulthood. Prior studies indicate widespread, sex-specific transcriptomic changes and numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the frontal cortex following PNS and nerve injury. Here we performed genome wide DNA methylation and transcriptome-wide RNAseq analysis in the frontal cortex of male and female mice that underwent PNS, CCI or both. Our analysis revealed sex-dependent changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression, including in pathways related to neuronal and brain development, axonogenesis and synaptic regulation. The effect of DNA methylation on mRNA expression was tested in a subset of target genes.

Radio frequency (RF) energy fields, in the microwave range (300 MHz - 300 GHz), inherently exhibit effective tissue penetration. Upon absorption by tissue, these fields can induce localized thermal effects, thereby modulating neuronal activity. Integrating these principles, we present an original non-invasive brain stimulation method: Transcranial Radio Frequency Stimulation (TRFS). We provide in vivo proof-of-concept of TRFS efficacy in murine models, demonstrating TRFS's ability to: 1) suppress baseline neuronal activity when applied to the intact brain (TRFS pristine mode), and 2) selectively excite neural circuits in regions with prior overexpression of the thermosensitive TRPV1 ion channel (TRFS RF-genetics mode). We demonstrate these modulatory effects, using both neural activity monitoring and behavioral assays, by applying 3-25 W of RF energy at 945 MHz through custom-designed antennas that enable selective stimulation of the mouse brain while minimizing off-target effects on the body. Neural activity was monitored using GCaMP fiber photometry in head-fixed in vivo preparations, and behavioral changes were assessed via a rotation test in freely moving mice. These findings suggest that TRFS is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique with potential applications in the treatment of diverse neurological and psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

However, a long-standing question in vertebrate brain evolution is how the fundamental blueprint emerged. To probe the cellular and molecular origins of brain architecture in the chordate lineage, we performed single-nucleus RNA-seq combined with spatial transcriptomics and generated a three-dimensional cell atlas of the basal chordate amphioxus central nervous system (CNS). This atlas reveals a tripartite organization along the anterior-posterior axis of the adult amphioxus brain, with a rostral retinal/hypothalamic region followed by a di-mesencephalon and caudally, the hindbrain and spinal cord. Notably, we show that the amphioxus brain contains cell clusters resembling the zona limitans intrathalamica and midbrain-hindbrain boundary, both of which demarcate the major brain compartments. Furthermore, expression profiling and gene ontology enrichment analyses support that the cell clusters located in the rostral part of the amphioxus forebrain correspond to vertebrate retinal primordium and hypothalamic cells. However, the absence of key telencephalic marker expression in the amphioxus anterior forebrain suggests that the telencephalon likely represents a vertebrate innovation.

However, the limited clinical success of selective melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonists prompted the investigation of whether concurrent melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) and MC4R activation is key to unlocking the melanocortin system for the treatment of general obesity. To test this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized novel peptides to probe the distinct and combined roles of MC3R and MC4R in nonhuman primates (NHPs). We show that selectively agonizing MC3R modulates food intake in a state-dependent manner. Moreover, co-agonism of MC3R and MC4R results in more substantial metabolic effects than selective MC4R agonism, highlighting both a non-redundant and a cooperative role of MC3R. To leverage these discoveries, we developed 710GO, an orally-available MC3R/MC4R dual agonist peptide that induces significant weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) NHPs. Oral 710GO treatment demonstrates limited weight rebound, has additive effects in combination with GLP-1s, and exhibits a clean safety profile.

Mouse MPCs (mMPC) were obtained from HSC following 10-day ex vivo expansion. Skin grafts were tested in host mice that either received a lethal dose of irradiation and reconstitution with allogeneic mMPC and third party HSCs or were given injections with depleting antibodies and chemotherapeutics followed by transplantation of mMPC without HSC. mMPC-matched grafts were protected and no significant difference was observed between mice receiving irradiation and fully matched grafts (major and minor transplantation antigens), partially matched grafts (major only), and fully matched grafts in mice that received sublethal irradiation. Haploidentical grafts (half of the MHC alleles not matched at all) are not protected. We conclude that closely matched mMPCs are sufficient to prevent rejection.

The methylation levels of nearby CpG sites influence many enzymatic reactions governing DNA methylation. However, efficiently modeling this influence, known as \"collaborative\" DNA methylation, is computationally challenging. We compare the efficiency and accuracy of three collaborative DNA methylation modeling approaches: a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), an exact Chemical Master Equation (CME), and a mean-field CME. The exact CME model provides high accuracy but is limited to small system sizes due to its exponential state-space growth of 3^N for N CpG sites. In the neighbor-dependent mean-field CME model, qualitative methylation patterns are accurately captured, but runtimes scale as N^k, 4 < k < 6, for N CpG sites. The SSA model is accurate and its runtime scales as N^l, 1.6 < l < 2.5, but for smaller system sizes (N < 100), it is inefficient compared to the mean-field CME method. Across all three methods, bimodality is achieved when sufficiently strong collaboration among CpGs promotes balanced net methylating and demethylating flux, in concert with reactions that occur independently at individual sites. Our findings provide insight into both symmetric and asymmetric parameter regimes, the influence of CpG density, and the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in modeling collaborative DNA methylation dynamics, paving the way for future analysis.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and next-generation AR blockade (e.g., enzalutamide) are initially effective, but virtually all patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which frequently transitions to treatment-emergent neuroendocrine PCa (tNEPC) following AR suppression. The molecular logic that links AR blockade to lineage plasticity remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify PSMA2 (Proteasome Subunit Alpha 2) as a treatment-induced effector that mechanistically connects AR blockade to tNEPC evolution. Enzalutamide induces PSMA2 expression in AR-expressing PCa cells. Enforced PSMA2 expression accelerates HSP90 turnover, hypersensitizes AR to residual post-castration androgen, drives AR nuclear activity under androgen-poor conditions, and confers enzalutamide resistance. Conversely, PSMA2 silencing stabilizes HSP90, desensitizes CRPC to androgen, and re-sensitizes resistant cells to enzalutamide-induced cell death. Importantly, PSMA2 also promotes lineage plasticity: treatment-induced PSMA2 enhances transcriptional and phenotypic conversion toward tNEPC. Thus, we uncover a single stress-induced node (PSMA2 ) that both maintains AR-dependent survival under ADT and fuels the neuroendocrine transition. PSMA2 marks an AR-hypersensitized transitional state and is itself a therapeutically actionable driver of tNEPC evolution, revealing an opportunity for rational interception of the lethal ADT-CRPC-tNEPC trajectory.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

However, the effects that NPY has on the electrical activity of ventricular myocytes remain poorly understood. Previous studies have examined the influence of NPY alone on cardiac ion channel function, but not in the presence of NE, which is the situation expected in vivo. Furthermore, no one has examined the effects of NPY on ion channel activity following MI.

We found that NPY alone has a stimulatory effect on the Ca2+ current in myocytes isolated from healthy pigs. However, in the presence of NE, the effect of NPY was inhibitory. The stimulatory effect of NPY alone was blocked by the Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304, while the inhibitory effect observed in the presence of NE was blocked by the Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), beta synchronization becomes pathologically elevated, contributing to motor slowing and rigidity and motivating the need for non-invasive strategies that can suppress excessive beta activity. Transcranial alternating stimulation (tACS) provides a non-invasive approach to modify endogenous oscillatory activity, yet conventional open-loop tACS typically reinforces, rather than disrupts, endogenous synchrony. Here, we developed an online adaptive EEG-guided closed-loop system that continuously tracked the instantaneous beta phase and delivered stimulation either aligned (in-phase) or 180 degrees opposed (anti-phase) to the ongoing beta rhythm. Thirty-eight right-handed healthy participants performed a stop-signal task while receiving 4x1 HD-tACS over pre-supplementary motor cortex (preSMA) in three conditions: in-phase, anti-phase, and sham. Anti-phase tACS produced a robust suppression of beta relative to both in-phase and sham stimulation, consistent with destructive interference of the endogenous rhythm. Behaviorally, anti-phase tACS slowed the stopping process, whereas in-phase stimulation reduced peak force rate during go trials and decreased variability of the go response, consistent with increased inhibitory tone and stabilization of ongoing motor states.

Previous studies achieve reliable firing-rate propagation in feedforward circuits only with finely tuned synaptic weights; otherwise, firing rate activity either decays or explodes. How neural circuits self-organize to achieve stable rate propagation without external fine-tuning remains unclear. Here, we introduce a simple, local homeostatic synaptic scaling rule in which each neuron rescales its excitatory inputs based on the mismatch between mean excitatory presynaptic and postsynaptic firing rate. We show both analytically and numerically that this local learning rule enables noisy feedforward networks to spontaneously organize stable rate propagation across layers when driven by external inputs, without the need for global supervision or precise weight initialization. This rule compensates for intrinsic neuronal properties by adjusting synaptic strengths to maintain consistent firing rate transmission, which allows heterogeneous feedforward networks to self-organize to support stable rate propagation. Finally, we show that when combined with homeostatic inhibitory synaptic plasticity, the rule stabilizes attractor firing rate in recurrent networks, preserving an asynchronous-irregular activity under perturbations.

A. A. H.", "abstract": "Rationale: The neurophysiological basis of motor imagery (MI) is foundational to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development. While BCI decoding relies on local sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), MI itself is a large-scale network process. It is an open, and clinically critical question whether an individual's BCI decoding skill is related to global network integration. This is complicated when the instructed task (e.g., postural imagery) differs from the underlying neurophysiological signal (e.g., hand-area SMRs). This study investigates the network dynamics of this task-signal mismatch and its relation to BCI performance. Methods: We analyzed a 64-channel EEG dataset of 32 healthy participants (from the OpenNeuro dataset ds005342 cohort) performing a cued motor imagery task (e.g., \"sit-to-stand\") contrasted against an idle state. BCI decoding performance was quantified using a Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) pipeline with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers. We then constructed functional brain networks from the beta (13-30 Hz) band using Phase-Locking Value (PLV) and spectral Granger Causality (GC). Graph theory was employed to analyze network topology, and we correlated individual BCI accuracy with global network efficiency in both sensor and source space. Results: BCI performance was robustly high (LDA (Mean: 82.10% {+/-} 8.80% SD)), 95% CI [78.92%, 85.28%], p < 10-20), confirming a high-fidelity local SMR signal. Strikingly, CSP analysis revealed this signal originated not from the expected leg-area (Cz), but from the hand-area sensorimotor cortex (C3/C4) (See Figure 4). Despite this local-signal fidelity, this decoding skill was critically decoupled from whole-brain network integration, showing no correlation of BCI accuracy with global efficiency, in either sensor space (r (30) = 0.189, p = 0.299) or, more critically, in source space (r (30) = -0.054, p = 0.769, 95% CI [-0.395, 0.300]). Our network analysis, centered on this C3/C4-dominant signal, revealed a novel, hypothetical M1-centric model: the motor cortex (C3/C4) acted as the primary information broadcaster (via GC), driving activity in prefrontal coordinating hubs (F3/Fz). Furthermore, the MI state was characterized by a dynamic reconfiguration, increasing the information-gating centrality of the premotor (FC1) node while suppressing the parietal (P3) node. Conclusion: BCI decoding skill reflects a local process driven by SMR signal fidelity from the dominant hand area--even during non-hand tasks--rather than a global process relying on whole-brain efficiency. We propose a hypothetical \"Broadcasting Motor Cortex\" model in which the MI network is not a simple PFC-M1 hierarchy but a dynamic, M1-centered system that re-routes information through premotor and parietal gateways. Within this framework, baseline network properties may influence skill, but task-evoked global integration does not emerge as a strong correlate of performance. Given that our study was powered only to detect large correlations (r > 0.48), the absence of such effects suggests that baseline network states (16, 17), rather than active global integration, are more likely to predict individual BCI ability.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

The proteolytic processing of APP also generates soluble APP alpha (sAPPa) which can modulate synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth through the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR). Whether GABABR mediates functions of sAPPa; in other neural cell types such as glia remains unknown. sAPPa; binds the R1a subunit isoform of GABABR1 which contains two sushi domains absent in R1b. It is unclear whether both GABABR1 isoforms are expressed equally across brain cell types. We determined relative RNA levels of the GABABR1a and 1b isoforms in oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons in adult mice using two approaches. We developed a GABABR1 isoform-specific RNAseq analysis workflow to probe a publicly available dataset generated by Zhang et al. (2014). We also isolated five cell types from a single mouse brain and performed RT-qPCR. We show that the GABABR1a and 1b isoforms are differentially expressed among cell types. GABABR1a expression was highest in oligodendrocytes and GABABR1b expression was highest in astrocytes, suggesting that sAPPa-mediated GABABR signaling may be most prominent in oligodendrocytes. We also confirmed that APP is expressed in all five cell types and showed that APP RNA levels are highest in oligodendrocytes. Together, our findings uncover cell type-specific expression of GABABR isoforms and highlight oligodendrocytes as a principal cell type for GABABR1a-mediated APP signaling, providing a foundation for future mechanistic studies.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Mechanisms that link HDP to CVD, however, remain unclear. Methods: We used a high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry approach to profile the distribution and functional responses of maternal immune cells in three separate groups of HDP cases and normotensive controls, sampled antepartum, postpartum, and several years postpartum (midlife). We used multivariable sparse modeling to distinguish HDP cases from controls. Results: We accurately distinguished HDP cases from controls at all three study timepoints, with area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve values of 0.814 for the antepartum group, 0.757 for the postpartum group, and 0.692 for the midlife group. Distinct immune signatures for each model underscore the dynamic dysregulation of the immune system throughout life. In addition, we identified a persistent immune dysregulation signal among HDP cases at all three timepoints, characterized by increased B cell frequency and decreased pSTAT3 response upon cytokine stimulation in classical monocytes. Conclusions: Persistent immune dysregulation among women with a history of an HDP may contribute to elevated long-term risk of CVD development.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

However, the heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dynamics of HSCs across these different injury models remain elusive. This study sought to construct a cross-etiological HSC atlas to delineate HSC states and transitions during liver injury. Methods: We integrated 86,072 single-cell transcriptomes from 84 mouse samples across four etiologies and validated findings using multi-omics data from 277 mouse and 798 human samples. Cellular dynamics were characterized through clustering, trajectory inference, spatial analysis, and multicellular coordination network analysis. Experimental validation included liver injury models and gain-of-functional assays in primary mouse HSCs and LX-2 cells. Results: We established a cross-etiological, spatiotemporally resolved HSC atlas comprising 11 subpopulations. Trajectory analysis delineated a continuous quiescence-activation-attenuation (QAA) trajectory, recapitulating the in vivo full spectrum of state transitions and being supported by sequential pathway activation validated in vitro. In ALI, HSCs spatiotemporally completed the QAA trajectory around injury zones, whereas collagen-producing S100a6 HSCs pathologically accumulated in mouse and human CLI due to trajectory dysregulation. Notably, the atlas identified a previously unrecognized apoptosis-prone Mrc2 HSC subtype strongly co-localized with p53 in both mice and humans. Overexpression of transcription factors confirmed that Hbp1, Tbx20, Atoh8, and Plagl1 enriched in Mrc2+ HSCs promoted HSC apoptosis. Finally, we revealed the microenvironment of distinct cellular modules which coordinated HSC progression along the QAA trajectory. A 531-gene signature derived from the inflammatory-fibrotic cellular module significantly correlated with fibrosis stage and hepatocellular carcinoma risk in human cohorts. Conclusions: We established a comprehensive HSC atlas and delineates HSC heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dynamic across etiologies. Dysregulation of the QAA trajectory underlies fibrotic progression, providing a resource for identifying antifibrotic targets.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

This study reveals a critical role for progranulin (PGRN) in regulating vascular senescence, function, and remodeling during aging. Methods: We assessed PGRN expression in human and mouse arteries and senescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Functional vascular studies were performed in PGRN-deficient (PGRN-/-) mice. Senescence was modulated pharmacologically using the senolytic agent navitoclax (ABT-263), and vascular phenotype was evaluated in adult (6-month-old) and aged mice (18-month-old). Results: PGRN expression increased with age in human and mouse arteries, correlating with elevated p21 expression. PGRN deficiency in adult mice induced endothelial dysfunction, increased vasoconstriction, and induced vascular inflammation and remodeling. Transcriptomic analysis of PGRN-/- VSMCs revealed a senescence-associated signature, including perturbed oxidative phosphorylation, altered epigenetic regulation, and collagen pathways. Pharmacological clearance of senescent cells improved endothelial function but increased vascular contractility in PGRN-/- mice. In aged mice, PGRN deficiency aggravated vascular dysfunction, remodeling, and renal injury without further increasing senescence markers - suggesting premature, rather than progressive, senescence in the PGRN-/- mice. Conclusion: PGRN is a novel regulator of vascular aging, coordinating senescence, inflammation, and remodeling. While endothelial senescence contributes to dysfunction, VSMCs senescence may serve an adaptive role in modulating vascular tone. Targeting PGRN or senescence pathways may offer therapeutic opportunities for age-related vascular diseases, especially in patients with PGRN mutations associated with frontotemporal dementia.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Root hairs absorb water and mineral nutrients while anchoring growing root tips. They must navigate through soils of varying mechanical properties. Mechanical changes in their microenvironment affect root hair shape and growth rate, but what underlies these responses has remained elusive. To uncover these mechanisms, we grew seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) in media with increasing mechanical stiffness. Col-0 seedlings showed both shorter and fewer root hairs with increasing mechanical resistance. We used incipient plasmolysis to estimate turgor pressure in trichoblasts and found that it also decreased with increasing media stiffness. Because cellulose is the major load-bearing polymer in the cell wall and influences cell expansion, we quantified cellulose orientation in root hairs. We found that cellulose fibrils were oriented at steeper angles relative to the growth axis in root hairs grown in stiffer media, suggesting a response to mechanical stress. Cell wall thickness also increased with increasing media stiffness. Microtubule orientations followed patterns that were similar to those of cellulose fibrils, but at a smaller angle relative to the growth axis, whereas microtubule density decreased with increasing media stiffness. Unexpectedly, we observed that root hairs grew faster in stiffer media, implying that their growth is misregulated, potentially triggering wall integrity signaling that causes early growth arrest. Finite element modeling of root hairs predicted decreased surface stress, explaining these growth phenotypes. These findings help establish mechanistic links between mechanotransduction, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell wall assembly during root hair growth.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Nuclear transplantation (NT) is a potentially useful reproductive technology with applications to conservation in specific circumstances. Although sperm have been successfully cryopreserved and used in in vitro fertilization to produce sexually mature offspring, there are many endangered and even extinct amphibian species that only exist as stored frozen adult or larval tissues. The only way to recover that genetic diversity is through NT. Nuclear transplantation can introduce new genes into captive breeding programs from individuals where no viable gametes from that individual have been cryopreserved. Amphibian NT research was common during the middle to late 20th century; however, it was never conducted for amphibian conservation. Early amphibian NT experiments were conducted for the purpose of determining whether differentiation was a terminal process that involved the loss of reprogramming genes. However, following the success of mammalian NT, amphibian NT research declined, and the field has been at a standstill for decades. This study developed the first nuclear transplantation protocol for a native Australia frog using Limnodynastes peronii, as a model. Specifically, this paper aimed to test: 1) nuclear transplantation with fresh embryonic cells in Limnodynastes peronii and trial the implementation of different egg enucleation methods (pricked eggs only, UV only, and pricked + UV), 2) use of cryopreserved cells in nuclear transplantation and 3) use single nucleotide polymorphisms to determine if the nuclear genomes of nuclear transplant embryos were derived from the injected donor cell nuclei. With both fresh and cryopreserved embryonic cells as donor cell nuclei, development of the nuclear transplant embryos was low compared to the fertilized controls. Only one nuclear transplant embryo derived from a fresh embryonic cell (injected into a UV only enucleated egg) developed into a tadpole. This attained stage 36 of the Gosner Staging System for Anurans (hind limbs) before dying. As an egg activation technique, pricking the eggs resulted in higher cleavage rates and development to blastula than UV only and pricked + UV nuclear transplants (in trials with cryopreserved cells), but none of the nuclear transplants from the pricked only group developed beyond blastula. None of the nuclear transplants derived from cryopreserved embryonic cells developed to tadpoles. The most advanced stage attained from cryopreserved embryonic cells was stage 13 (neurula) from UV only eggs. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis testing for genotype mismatches was used to determine if the genomes of developing nuclear transplant embryos were derived from the injected donor cell nucleus. SNP analysis confirmed that two true clones were generated in this study. This is the first confirmed nuclear transplantation in any Australian native frog.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

We found that early-stage axons are enriched in transcripts involved in axon guidance and growth, while mature axons predominantly translate mRNAs related to synaptic function. Among key candidates, we identified PlxnA4, which is locally translated into mDA axons and modulates arborization in response to Sema3a. Functional assays in vitro and in vivo revealed that Plxna4-mediated signaling regulates topographical axon targeting and innervation, particularly in the nigrostriatal pathway.

Because these genes often act redundantly, analysis of single-gene mutants does not necessarily reveal the full roles of Wnt signaling. In C. elegans, three Wnt genes (cwn-1, egl-20, and cwn-2) and three receptor genes (lin-17/Fzd, mom-5/Fzd, and cam-1/Ror) redundantly regulate the polarity of asymmetrically dividing seam cells. Here, we comprehensively analyzed genetic interactions among these Wnt and receptor genes. In mom- 5 mutant backgrounds, additional mutations in Wnt genes disrupted cell polarization. In contrast, in cam-1 mutant backgrounds, Wnt mutations frequently caused abnormal polarity orientation. These findings indicate that MOM-5 and CAM-1 play distinct roles in establishing cell polarization and determining its orientation, respectively. lin-17 mutations suppressed polarity reversal in multiple Wnt compound mutants, suggesting that LIN-17 may function as a molecular switch for polarity orientation. Although all three Wnt genes regulate polarity orientation in a gradient-independent manner in the absence of receptor mutations, in lin-17 mutant backgrounds, reversing the expression gradients of cwn-1 and egl-20, but not cwn-2, enhanced polarity reversal. This suggests that cwn-1 and egl-20 act not only permissively but also instructively to regulate polarity orientation.

Here, we map mutations at single-nucleotide resolution, and uncover a striking hypermutation peak at transcription start sites (TSSs). This pattern is observed both in population polymorphisms (gnomAD) and in de novo mutations from parent-offspring trios, and is dependent on transcriptional activity in testes. We also find a hypermutation peak at TSSs used to produce long noncoding RNAs and at intergenic RNA Polymerase II pause sites. We also identify distinct mutational signatures at exon-intron boundaries and in introns. By comparing the current nucleotide content to predicted equilibrium levels, inferred from mutation and fixation rates, we observe signals that are compatible with a low level of ongoing background GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) throughout the region and ancestral gBGC occurring just downstream from the TSS. Using a forward-in-time simulation algorithm we demonstrate that the current nucleotide composition surrounding the TSS of protein-coding genes is best explained by local biases in the mutation rate coupled to gBGC, due to ongoing and ancestral crossover events. We then use the algorithm to model some of the features of these gBGC events. Overall, these findings indicate that the local nucleotide composition around TSSs is largely shaped by non-adaptive forces, such as mutation bias and gBGC.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

The 3D-printed, transparent, deformable CNS phantom enables precise control of infusion and physiological parameters, allowing systematic generation of reliable and repeatable biodispersion data for lumbar IT infusion protocols. Pulsatile artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the closed system was tuned to replicate subject-specific stroke volumes and flow rates observed in MRI. The model's optical clarity facilitated high-speed visualization and tracking of tracer dispersion, exceeding the temporal resolution of current neuroimaging techniques. Experimental series spanning physiologically relevant CSF and infusion conditions enabled quantification of the spatiotemporal distribution of IT-administered tracers. Inversion of the parabolic diffusion equation provided estimates of the coefficient of effective dispersion. A distributed pharmacokinetic model was used to evaluate the influence of chemical kinetics and mass transfer on tracer behavior.

Tanglegrams, which display two phylogenies side by side with lines connecting shared taxa, are widely used for comparing evolutionary histories, host-parasite associations, and horizontal gene transfer. Existing layout algorithms have largely focused on trees and on minimizing the number of inter-taxon edge crossings. We introduce displacement-optimized tanglegrams (DO-tanglegrams), a new approach that applies equally to trees and rooted phylogenetic networks. Our method explicitly minimizes taxon displacement - the vertical misalignment of corresponding taxa across the two sides - and reticulate displacement - the vertical distance spanned by reticulation edges within a network. We formalize one-sided and two-sided optimization problems, show that exact minimization is computationally intractable, and propose a heuristic that combines exhaustive local search with simulated annealing. The algorithm naturally accommodates unresolved nodes (multifurcations or multicombinations) and missing taxa. We have implemented the DO-tanglegram algorithm in SplitsTree. We compare our implementation against the cophylo R-package on a collection of synthetic trees, and against the NN-tanglegram algorithm in Dendroscope on a collection of synthetic networks.

TNF- downregulated OAT1-3 mRNA expression to an extent similar to IL-1{beta}, but did not affect other transporters. Activity changes for the major uptake transporters mirrored mRNA directionality. MAPK/NF-{kappa}B blockade by the inhibitor cocktail reduced IL-6 secretion while completely reversing the IL-1{beta}-driven downregulation of OAT1-3 mRNA. JNK inhibition alone restored OAT1/3 mRNA. Inhibition of p38MAPK blunted OAT2 mRNA downregulation. OCTN1 mRNA induction required NF-{kappa}B. Downregulation of OAT4/OCT2 mRNA was largely MAPK/NF-{kappa}B-independent. IL-6 alone, sIL-6R alone, or IL-6 + sIL-6R did not reproduce IL-1{beta}-driven changes in transporter mRNA. Conclusions IL-1{beta} is the principal driver of cytokine-mediated regulation of human renal transporters in PTECs via JNK/p38MAPK/NF-{kappa}B nodes. These mechanistic, exposure-verified data provide inputs for physiologically based pharmacokinetic predictions of renal secretory clearance and pathway-mediated drug interactions during inflammation.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

The control of lymphatic permeability and flow is essential for homeostatic regulation of tissue fluid balance and immune responses. Histamine has been identified as an important signaling mediator involved in the regulation of lymphatic function. Histamine is released from activated perilymphatic mast cells and may also be produced by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in response to flow-induced shear stress. The non-selective cation channel Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is an important mediator of signaling by GPCRs, including histamine receptors. TRPV4 is activated in response to shear stress and is functionally expressed by LECs. We hypothesized that histamine receptors and TRPV4 interact in LECs, leading to activation of distinct downstream signaling pathways. This study examined the mechanistic link between TRPV4 activity and histaminergic signaling in LECs. Principle Results. Histaminergic Ca2+ signaling was examined in primary human LECs. Responses to histamine were mainly driven by the H1R histamine receptor, with some contribution by the H4R subtype, as determined using selective antagonists. H4R signaling in response to 4-methylhistamine was effectively prevented by either removal of extracellular Ca2+ or block of TRPV4 activity, consistent with TRPV4-dependence. Conversely, activation of H4R resulted in marked sensitization of subsequent responses to the selective TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A. This interaction was mediated through a PLA2-dependent mechanism. TRPV4 activity was required for histamine receptor-evoked translocation of the Ca2+-dependent transcription factor NFATc1 and for cytoskeletal remodeling. By contrast, the release of cytokines in response to activation of either histamine receptors or TRPV4 were largely independent processes. Conclusions. This study identifies TRPV4 as an important mediator of histaminergic signaling in LECs. The findings provide further support for the involvement of TRPV4 in defining the nature and magnitude of endothelial signaling downstream of GPCRs.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Enhanced gut BT through MLN facilitates bacterial spread and higher mortality in cirrhosis. We aimed to elucidate mechanisms underlying MLN failure to effectively contain BT during advanced cirrhosis. Design: BT and immune cells were analyzed in lymphoid organs and circulation of control and CCl4 models, with and without MLN (MLNx). MLN proteomics identified versican (VCAN) as major upregulated protein in cirrhosis, whose immunomodulatory function was examined in vitro and in vivo in CCl4 and (Bile duct ligation) BDL models. Plasma VCAN were measured in end-stage cirrhosis patients and analyzed as mortality predictor. Results: In control rats, bacteria were confined to MLN, whereas cirrhotics showed BT to MLN, lymph, and portal blood. Compared to control, CCl4 rats had increased activated Th-cells in MLN but reduced in circulation. In control-MLNx rats, activated Th-cells were reduced in circulation vs controls. In BDL models, MLN CFU correlated with VCAN level. In vitro, VCAN enhanced T cell suppression and impaired migration which was reversed by CD44 blockade. In vivo VCAN knockdown reduced fibrosis and bacterial burden in MLN, while restoring Th-cell activation locally and systemically. Clinically, plasma VCAN levels were elevated in advanced cirrhosis patients and remained an independent predictor of 28-day sepsis-related mortality. Conclusion: Increased VCAN impairs T cell activation and migration in MLN, fostering immune suppression and bacterial persistence. Plasma VCAN levels serve as promising biomarker for MLN dysfunction and prognostic factor for predicting sepsis-related mortality in end-stage cirrhosis.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

It allows viral infections to rapidly spread locally via pollen and worldwide through seeds. To be vertically transmitted to each progeny, a virus must pass through the tight bottleneck of at least one cell per parent, the gametes. Therefore, stopping infection during sexual reproduction is of vital importance to generate healthy offspring. Accordingly, vertical transmission of plant viruses often occurs at very low rates, if at all, suggesting the existence of highly effective - yet unknown - antiviral defenses in pre-meiotic cells, gametes and/or embryos. In this study, we show that AGO5, an RNA interference factor expressed specifically in shoot apical meristem stem cells and the germline of Arabidopsis thaliana, drastically reduces the vertical transmission of Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV). Through a series of controlled pollination experiments leveraging different zygosity of ago5 knock-out, cell type-specific rescue of ago5 and TYMV detection in whole-mount reproductive tissues, we provide evidence that AGO5 acts in pollen and sperm cells to restrict virus transmission to progeny. We further show that triggering antiviral RNA interference specifically in sperm cells leads to a significant reduction in TYMV vertical transmission. In summary, this study provides the first description of a gamete-specific antiviral defense mechanism restricting virus vertical transmission, paving the way for new strategies to prevent the spread of pollen- and seed-borne viral epidemics.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Using a systems-level affinity screen with biotinylated InsP, InsP, and InsP in Arabidopsis thaliana, we identify multiple conserved PP-InsP-interacting complexes involved in mRNA metabolism, translation, and cell signaling, including the nuclear -subunits of casein kinase II (CK2). The CK2 subunit AtCKA1 associates with the PP-InsP kinase AtVIH2, and its 1.9 [A] crystal structure with InsP6 reveals two conserved PP-InsP binding sites located in the N- and C-terminal lobes. AtCKA1 binds InsP6, InsP7, and InsP8 with micromolar affinity. Mutation of both binding sites in the AtCKA6xmut mutant abolishes PP-InsP binding in vitro. AtCKA6xmut partially rescues the flowering phenotype of ck2a1/2/3 mutants, and equivalent mutations inactivate the yeast orthologs ScCka1 and ScCka2. InsP6 competitively inhibits phosphorylation of canonical CK2 substrates by occupying a basic substrate-binding groove. Although incorporating {beta}-subunits strongly enhances the phosphorylation of substrates by the AtCK2 holoenzyme, ck2b1/2/3/4 mutants exhibit only mild growth defects in Arabidopsis. In Marchantia, loss of the single ck2a gene severely impairs growth, whereas deletion of the {beta} subunit has no effect. Together, our findings suggest that InsP6/PP-InsPs modulate the activity of the isolated CK2 -subunit by regulating access to its substrate-binding site.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

NAC transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal for plant stress responses and hormone-mediated secondary metabolism, while abscisic acid (ABA) regulates terpenoid biosynthesis in medicinal plants. However, how NAC TFs mediate ABA-regulated triterpenoid saponin synthesis in C. blinii remains unclear. In order to address this gap, the focus was directed towards CbNAC63--a NAC TF identified from the nocturnal low-temperature transcriptome of C. blinii. Phylogenetic and motif analyses showed it belongs to the stress-responsive NAC subclade with conserved domains. Y2H assays revealed its self-interaction, enhancing transcriptional activity; subcellular localization confirmed nuclear localization. RT-qPCR results indicated CbNAC63 exhibits tissue-specific expression under nocturnal low-temperature stress, accompanied by increased triterpenoid saponin accumulation. ABA signaling primarily regulates this process: exogenous ABA enhanced CbNAC63 expression and saponin content, while fluridone suppressed both. Overexpression (OE) and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) demonstrated CbNAC63 positively regulates saponin biosynthesis. Y1H and dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed CbNAC63 directly binds to the promoters of Cb{beta}AS and CbHMGR and activates their transcription. In summary, the study shows CbNAC63 integrates ABA and low-temperature signals, activating MVA pathway genes to regulate saponin synthesis.

We knocked out both genes and investigated mutants using a standard panel of tests for growth, development, and pathogenicity for the respective fungi. Both{Delta} FgMST3 and{Delta} MoMST3 strains showed reduced pathogenicity. The deletions negatively affected conidia production and conidia germination but had little effect on growth rate. However, the two mutants reacted differently to various stress treatments, especially to Zn2+ and gentamicin.

The reporter gene responses to OMVs of MST3 mutant strains are severely reduced. Our results indicate that both MoMst3 and FgMst3 are involved in fungal innate immunity downstream of unknown NLR proteins, motivating studies to identify genes for the NLR receptors.

However, it remains unclear which T cell fate best supports long-term immunity following tumor regression or clearance and a period of minimal antigen load. This question is particularly relevant following surgical tumor resection, when tuning the immune system could prevent recurrence. To determine which T cell fate provides durable protection following surgery and metastatic rechallenge, we modulated T cell priming using anti-PD-1, IFN-b or agonistic anti-CD40 and assessed effects on CD8+ T cell differentiation and overall survival. IFN-b and anti-CD40 promoted effector and memory-like T cell states, respectively, whereas anti-PD-1 did not markedly alter T cell differentiation, yet conferred the greatest survival benefit against metastatic tumors. Notably, anti-PD-1 induced epigenetic remodeling, which was detectable upon metastatic recall, consistent with the maintenance of a circulatory intermediate-exhausted T cell state. Thus, while effector and memory precursor-like T cells could be generated with IFN-b and agonistic anti-CD40, only the intermediate-exhausted T cell state driven by anti-PD-1 supported durable anti-tumor immunity.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

We have employed yeast two-hybrid screenings to determine the interactome of Set1 and each subunit, providing a unique resource for exploring known and novel roles of the complex. Our screenings identified a multitude of interactors involved in chromatin regulation, DNA replication, meiotic breaks, and Ty transposition, processes previously associated with SET1C. Consistent with Set1 being an RNA-binding protein, the screens link SET1C to multiple aspects of RNA biogenesis, including pre-mRNA splicing and polyadenylation. The results reveal that Set1 interacts with several importins and with RGG motif-containing proteins, providing insights into the mechanisms by which Set1 moves between cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. We demonstrate that the transcriptional corepressor Nrm1 is methylated by SET1C in vitro suggesting that H3K4-like domains may represent a class of non-histone substrates for SET1C. We further reveal that reconstituted SET1C interacts with the AT hook domain of the chromatin remodeler Snf2 and methylates multiple arginines within this domain.

In this study, we identify a mechanism through which the formation of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAMs) modulates the activity of the acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), an enzyme that channels polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into phosphatidylcholine (PC) via the Lands cycle. Through integrated biochemical, proteomic, and lipidomic analyses in both cellular and animal models, we demonstrate that MAM formation enhances ACSL4 activity, promoting arachidonic acid (AA) activation and its preferential incorporation into PC in concert with the MAM-localized lysophospholipid acyltransferase 4 (LPCAT4). Our findings further uncover an unexpected link between this pathway and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). We show that elevated levels of C99, the {gamma}-secretase cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), induce MAM remodeling through cholesterol clustering, which in turn activates ACSL4 and alters PC composition. This effect is mirrored in AD models as well as in fibroblasts, neurons, and immune cells derived from both familial and sporadic AD patients, all of which exhibit chronically increased C99 levels, heightened ACSL4 activity, and enrichment of PUFA-containing PC species, leading to lipid imbalance and membrane dysfunction.

The molecular mechanisms and spatial organization of immune-stromal interactions in human tissue are poorly understood, limiting the potential to develop effective pharmacological therapy for AAA. METHODS: In this observational cross-sectional study, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from 11 AAA patients and 12 controls were analyzed by Xenium spatial transcriptomics. Cellular states and localization within tissue architecture were mapped to identify cellular neighborhoods and infer cell-cell communication. RESULTS: We generated a high-resolution spatial transcriptomics atlas of 581,664 cells in 26 clusters. AAAs showed a significant loss of contractile smooth muscle cells, expansion of pro-angiogenic endothelial subsets, and broad infiltration of immune cells. These inflammatory changes were accompanied by expansion of activated, universal, and CXCL12+ adventitial fibroblasts. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed fibroblast-immune colocalization and adventitial tertiary lymphoid organs. Inferred signaling pathway analysis identified increased interactions between CXCL12+ fibroblasts and CXCR4+ T and B cells in the adventitia of AAAs. Fibroblasts that expressed CXCL12 had significantly more immune cell neighbors than fibroblasts that did not, suggesting that they serve as stromal hubs for adaptive immune clustering. Genome-wide association analysis linked AAA heritability to fibroblasts, modulated smooth muscle cells, and foamy macrophages. CONCLUSION: Our novel high-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of human AAAs revealed coordinated pathogenic reprogramming of stromal and immune cells, defined by smooth muscle cell depletion, fibroblast activation, endothelial remodeling, and disproportionate expansion of immune cells.

Here, we combine in vitro mosaic endothelial cell (EC) cultures with agent-based modelling (ABM) to investigate how knockdown of the BMP9/10 pathway components ALK1 and SMAD4 alters cell-cell interactions and collective vascular organisation. Using cell tracking data, we inferred the mechanical interactions between neighbouring ECs in 2D monolayers by applying Approximate Bayesian Computation to an ABM of cell migration. SMAD4 knockdown increased the motile forces generated by ECs, while ALK1 knockdown weakened the ability of cells to push apart and rearrange with their neighbours, both resulting in greater mixing and fluidity within the cell layer. When these altered interaction profiles were incorporated into an ABM of collective EC dynamics during vascular remodelling, they gave rise to distinct AVM-prone phenotypes. SMAD4-deficient populations exhibited local blockages as highly polarised cells migrated excessively, whereas ALK1-deficient populations disrupted vascular patterning by impairing coordinated polarity and neighbour separation, favouring flow reversal.

Reintroduction programs are critical for restoring endangered species, yet their success hinges on a detailed understanding of stage-specific demographic rates and the factors limiting population growth. The scientific evaluation of reintroduction programs, particularly assessments and management recommendations informed by full life-cycle monitoring, remains limited. The Crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), once nearly extinct, has been the focus of intensive conservation efforts, including reintroduction into its historical range. Here, we systematically evaluate the success of a Crested ibis reintroduction population by integrating long-term field monitoring with population dynamic modeling. 2. We conducted a systematic, multi-year (2023-2025) demographic study of a reintroduced Crested ibis population in Dongzhai National Nature Reserve, China. From 2013 to 2023, a total of 133 captive Crested ibises were released in seven batches within the nature reserve. By 2025, the number of the wild population had exceeded 500. Based on the combination of field monitoring (n = 176 pairs) and GPS telemetry (n = 74 GPS tags, the longest living time lasting 4 years), we quantified reproductive output and mortality rates across six life stages: nest building, incubation, offspring provisioning, fledgling (< 1 year), subadult (1-2 years), and adult (> 2 years). 3. The results show that the average clutch size of this population is 3.24 {+/-} 0.08, and each pair of parent birds can rear 1.31 {+/-} 0.12 nestlings to fledging each year. And we found that high mortality during the incubation (32.5%, n = 425 eggs), offspring provisioning (34.1%, n = 287 chicks), and fledgling stages (38.6%, n = 63 birds). Key causes included unfertilized eggs, predation, food shortage, and human disturbance. While in the nest building (9.1%, n = 176 pairs), subadult (9.8%, n = 28 birds) and adult stage (21.3%, n = 15 birds), the mortality rate was relatively low. Stage-structured matrix model showed a positive population growth of this reintroduced population (growth rate {lambda} = 1.053), with the population expected to increase 13-fold over 50 years (6858 individuals). Sensitivity analysis indicated that adult survival had the strongest influence on population growth. Correspondingly, we predict that by 2075, its distribution range will expand 13-fold in tandem with population growth, exceeding 51,000 square kilometers and covering several surrounding cities. 4. Our full life-cycle monitoring, evaluation and simulation confirms this reintroduced population is a successful establishment and a self-sustaining population. This addressed research discrepancy of scientific and systematic assessment of population reintroduction in endangered species. Moreover, we proposed key conservation practices and targeted strategies for improving population growth and maintenance: predator control, supplemental feeding, rescue of weak chicks, reducing human disturbance via public engagement, and implementing genetic management to avoid inbreeding. Our framework provides a practical model of enhancing reintroduction success and species recovery for other endangered species.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

However, foraging is only one of many ways animals interact with their environment, and preferences for habitat features that support resting, breeding, and safety, along with trade-offs between these needs, remain underexplored. These trade-offs are likely to be particularly acute in complex environments where these needs are met in different locations. Using a long-term dataset of movements and life history, we examine how preferences for foraging areas and burrow sites shape space use in Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta). Meerkats cannot dig new sleeping and breeding burrows and must use those abandoned by other species, potentially generating trade-offs in daily space use if overnight refuges are far from optimal foraging areas. We find that space use is strongly anchored by burrow location, with burrows in calcareous pans and dry riverbed ('white sand') habitat being preferred year-round and showing lower burrow switching rates. However, white sand areas were not preferred for foraging, and yielded lower weight gains, particularly during the dry season. As a result, meerkats faced a trade-off between optimal burrow locations and productive foraging grounds, as indicated by faster, longer, and more energetically costly travel when moving through or waking up in white sands. Our results suggest that changes in the distribution or abundance of key burrow-constructing species in desert environments may have cascading effects on the many secondary burrow-using species that depend on them for survival and reproduction. More broadly, our results highlight that limited refuge availability across the landscape can impose strong ecological constraints on animals and may restrict behavioural plasticity under environmental change, particularly if productive foraging areas shift.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Moreover, quantifying bioactive compounds is expensive. Genomic selection (GS), which leverages genome-wide markers to predict breeding values and assemble favorable alleles, offers a practical way to unlock latent genetic potential. As a model case, we evaluated GS in red perilla (Perilla frutescens). Building on previous work, we implemented a cross-selection strategy that prioritized segregation variance by selecting crosses based on predicted additive genotypic values of the progeny, and evaluated its effectiveness through actual crossing experiments targeting three key medicinal compounds. Progeny from GS-based crosses (Crs1 to Crs7) outperformed those from phenotypic selection (Crs8) in the G2 generation, demonstrating a higher mean, greater variance, and superior top individuals. The best G2 individual exhibited nearly twofold higher levels of two target compounds relative to the existing cultivar 'Sekiho'. This study provides the first empirical demonstration that GS can improve multiple medicinal compounds in red perilla and highlights the effectiveness of cross-selection based on predicted progeny performance. In addition, the evidence presented here supports the broader application of GS in underutilized medicinal plants.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

However, current ST strategies are limited to tissue sections, unable to directly profile spatiotemporal transcriptome landscapes of individual living animals. To overcome this limitation, we present acupuncture-extracted in vivo spatiotemporal transcriptomics (aivST). It is mainly based on engineering clinical-grade acupuncture gold microneedles as a spatial-barcoding array patch with high-performance DNA recognition interfaces. These interfaces first utilize nanoparticles surface deposition to increase the density of DNA probes. A freeze-thawing method is further developed to regulate interfaced DNA probes with laterally uniform distribution and vertically upright conformation, mainly by loose stretching and local concentration of these DNA probes. It increased mRNA capture with 250% and speeded up reaction (from 60 min to 15 min), compared to that without freeze-thawing surface engineering. Using this method, we explored in vivo spatiotemporal transcriptome dynamics during skin wound healing of individual mice. We found four distinct expression changes of transcripts, including continuous upregulation, continuous downregulation, initial upregulation then downregulation, and initial downregulation then upregulation.

Distinct hot and cold TIMEs differ in pre-existing effector T-cell activity and treatment-induced immunogenicity, suggesting that combination regimens should be tailored to microenvironmental context under realistic clinical constraints. Here we develop a deterministic dynamic optimization framework that jointly designs chemotherapy and ICI dosing schedules on a mechanistic tumor-immune model. The model tracks sensitive and resistant tumor cells, effector CD8+ T cells and circulating drug concentrations with pharmacodynamic couplings encoding immunogenic cell death and checkpoint inhibition. We formulate a continuous-time optimal control problem that balances tumor burden against drug exposure while enforcing cumulative dose limits, end-of-interval concentration bounds and bounds on stepwise changes in infusion rates. Using gradient-based optimization with embedded forward sensitivities, we solve the resulting nonlinear programs for four representative TIME phenotypes (extremely cold, hot, cold and cold with high antigenic resistance). The optimizer recovers qualitatively distinct and biologically interpretable regimens, including chemotherapy-dominated schedules in extremely cold TIMEs, aggressive early ICI administration in hot TIMEs and minimal ICI pulses in cold TIMEs. Alternative weightings of treatment objectives reveal trade-offs between tumor eradication and effector preservation.

However, the discovery of novel AMPs through biological experiments remains constrained by high costs, labor-intensive workflows, and time-consuming procedures, underscoring the urgent need for in silico computational methods to design AMP sequences. In particular, shorter AMPs (<= 30 residues) demonstrate superior antimicrobial efficacy, improved structural stability, and minimal cytotoxicity in human cells. To address these challenges, we present a classifier-guided diffusion framework specialized for generating AMPs shorter than 30 residues (ClsDiff-AMP30). The architecture integrates two interdependent submodels, including a noisy AMP classifier that evaluates AMP probability score at intermediate denoising steps and a noise predictor guided by classifier-derived probability scores, dynamically adjusted via a self-optimized coefficient to modulate guidance strength. ClsDiff-AMP30 achieves a generate accuracy of 66% across 10,000 synthesized sequences by a self-developed AMP classifier.

As such, numerous clinical and preclinical studies suggest that elevated oxidative stress, combined with the heightened pro-inflammatory milieu observed in CF phenotypes, likely increases susceptibility to recurrent infection-inflammation cycles. We aimed to use the IVOS sensor to characterise oxidative environmental differences in wildtype, CF Phe508del and CFTR knockout rat epithelial tissues including the lungs, trachea, nasal mucosa, and oesophagus. Our results revealed no significant differences in the baseline redox balance between wildtype, Phe508del and knockout rat tissues, however when we looked at short term fluctuations in redox status using the ratio of the root mean squared of successive differences (RMSSD) to the normalised mean IVOS arbitrary units, we saw significantly elevated fluctuations in the redox status in the bronchi of Phe508del rats compared to wildtype rats, indicating a lower steady-state oxidative environment combined with large transient oxidative events.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Genome-wide single-molecule accessibility and sequencing analyses further reveal that these dynamics occur in cells. This intrinsic flexibility is modulated by DNA sequence, methylation, and nucleosome positioning, and enables a previously uncharacterized single-stranded DNA binding state. Through biochemical dissection of cohesin components, we find that a negative regulator of loop extrusion, PDS5, remodels ZF dynamics and imparts exceptional mechanical stability to CTCF on DNA.

Ocean-dwelling organisms such as oceanic phytoplankton must therefore adapt to the available levels.

As a group, diatoms contribute around 20% of global primary photosynthetic productivity, they have also developed specific resources allowing them to thrive in low-iron regions. However, the major biological factors underlying their success in these ocean environments remain unknown. Here, we compared two Thalassiosira species: T. oceanica from iron-poor open-ocean; and T. pseudonana, from iron-rich coastal waters. Since iron is essential for both photosynthesis and respiration, we examined the specificities of the bioenergetic machineries in these organisms using a combination of photo-physiological, proteomics, and FIB-SEM methods. We particularly focused on chloroplast-mitochondrial coupling, a mechanism deployed by diatoms to ensure optimal transfer of photosynthetic products to promote cell growth. This study of this mechanism in the context of iron limitation reveals that the two diatoms differentially remodel chloroplast compartments in response to iron limitation. Their tolerance to these conditions is also linked to distinct constitutive mitochondrial architectures.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Aggregated expression divergence revealed that multilocus genotypes showed detectable baseline transcriptional differences prior to infection and distinct temporal trajectories following inoculation. Co-expression analysis identified five higher-order metamodules and uncovered non-additive network restructuring, with the triple-locus line showing markedly reduced co-expression density rather than incremental strengthening. Layer-associated genes related to recognition, signal integration, and defense action displayed genotype- and time-specific expression patterns, suggesting that each locus combination is associated with characteristic shifts in immune-layer dynamics. Transcriptome profiles suggested that Rpv12 involves elevated transcript abundance of several EDS1-associated components despite its CNL-type origin; adding Rpv1 introduced pronounced early changes in recognition- and signaling-related genes; and stacking Rpv3 coincided with rapid, transient induction of transcription factors (e.g., WRKY47, NAC29) and metabolic defense pathways.

In this study, we dissected the genetic and molecular basis of AM fungi induced lateral root development in maize (Zea mays), focusing on the role of ethylene-responsive transcription factors (ERFs). We identified ERF genes as essential regulators of pericycle cell division, acting downstream of ethylene biosynthesis genes (ACS6 and ACS7) and AM fungal signaling. Our findings reveal that AM fungi promote lateral root initiation by activating ERF expression and reprogramming flavonoid metabolism, particularly reducing the accumulation of flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin, which otherwise inhibit root development when over accumulated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Massilia, a beneficial rhizobacterium, synergizes with AM fungi to enhance lateral root formation by colonizing fungal hyphae, degrading flavonoids, and contributing to auxin production.

Methods: We developed a simplified, animal-origin-free protocol for BVO generation that addresses current limitations and enables high-throughput automated workflows. The method employs ultra-low attachment 96-well U-bottom plates for standardized aggregation and differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in a human derived collagen-based extracellular matrix. Unlike conventional protocols where aggregates are embedded in a two-layer ECM, our approach utilizes a single-layer, which we termed sitting drop. This innovative approach requires considerably fewer materials and handling steps and is compatible with high-throughput automated machines. Results: BVO generation utilizing the here described optimized protocol resulted in the formation of BVOs with reproducible morphology and cellular composition. Flow cytometry confirmed the presence of CD31+ endothelial cells and PDGFRb+ pericytes in BVOs, generated in sitting drops, with cell population percentages comparable to those observed in traditional two-layer BVO cultures. In vivo transplantation of mature BVOs in a mouse full-thickness skin wound model demonstrated successful integration of BVO derived cells into host vessels, highlighting their potential in cell-based therapies.

Both rAtKPI-1T and rTgPI-1 exhibited inhibitory effects against Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, P. syringae (AvRpm1), and P. viridiflava in a concentration-dependent manner, with significant inhibition at 3.5 M. The lower MIC50 values obtained for rTgPI-1 and its truncated forms compared to rAtKPI-1T suggest a higher antibacterial potency. Binding and immunofluorescence assays further revealed that rAtKPI-1T, rTgPI-1, and rTgPI-1NT associated with bacterial surfaces, while rTgPI-1CT displayed weaker or transient interactions. In addition to their antibacterial activity, rTgPI-1NT and rTgPI-1CT also inhibited the germination of Botrytis cinerea conidia. Both truncated proteins significantly reduced germination after 6 and 9 hours of incubation, with rTgPI-1CT exerting a markedly stronger antifungal effect than rTgPI-1NT.

Yet, we lack a comprehensive assessment of what defines and drives the microbial communities that dominate life in these regions. Here, we conducted a standardized field survey in contrasting cold, hot, and polar deserts across the seven continents, and observed geographically distant deserts share similar structure, function, and activities. Desert communities are dominated by genomically streamlined Actinobacteriota and Chloroflexota, and compared with non-desert soils, are significantly enriched with stress tolerance genes, mobile genetic elements, and antiviral strategies, revealing previously unknown ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Metabolically, these communities exhibit reduced capacity for carbohydrate and protein degradation, and instead are enriched for chemosynthetic carbon fixation, continuous energy harvesting using atmospheric trace gases and sunlight, and energy reserve biosynthesis. All sampled soils mediated respiration, trace gas oxidation, and carbon fixation, with detectable activity even in hyper-arid Atacama and Antarctic soils at the margins of life. Driver analyses identified aridity as the primary overriding driver of the microbial communities and biogeochemical activities. Collectively, these findings suggest that aridity selects for metabolically self-sufficient taxa capable of continuously meeting energy and carbon needs independently of vegetation-derived inputs, while enduring physicochemical stressors and potentially elevated viral pressure. These new insights are integral to forecast the future of soils amid increasing desertification.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Of the many distinctions between the external environment and mammalian tissues, CO2 concentration in the host is 2 orders of magnitude higher than in the environment and represent a critical stress for C. neoformans. C. neoformans strains that do not replicate at host CO2 concentrations are less virulent in mouse models of infection, further supporting CO2 tolerance as a virulence trait. To further understand the genetic determinants of C. neoformans CO2 tolerance, we performed a near genome-wide screen for deletion mutants with altered CO2 fitness using a competitive growth assay. A total of 301 of 4698 deletion mutants showed altered CO2 tolerance (245 reduced fitness; 51 increased fitness) demonstrating the global effect of host CO2 on C. neoformans physiology. Based on this data set as well as a metabolomic analysis of C. neoformans adaptation to host CO2, we show that remodeling of central carbon metabolism, oxidative stress buffering and membrane homeostasis represent an integrated response to CO2 stress that is mediated in part by the TOR-Ypk1 signaling axis. We propose that CO2-induced capsule formation leads to reduced cellular glucose which, in turn, triggers remodeling of central carbon metabolism toward utilization of alternative carbon sources and increased mitochondrial respiration/reactive oxygen generation. Thus, these data provide a near genome-wide profile of the genetic determinants of C. neoformans CO2 tolerance as well as a model for how this important environmental human fungal pathogen alters its physiology to proliferate in the host.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

J.; Nguyen, T. H.", "abstract": "The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria posing serious threat to global public health has been a focus for many studies. Coexistence of integrons and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has been widely observed in various environments. It has long been considered that most correlated ARGs were carried by integron gene cassettes. In this study, we show, for the first time, evidence that integron presence is linked to the accumulation of multiple ARGs beyond their cassette arrays, resulting in the formation of multi-ARG plasmids. By analyzing 1102 plasmid sequences retrieved from PLSDB RefSeq across incompatibility groups, host genera, and plasmid sizes, we show that the increased ARGs on integron-positive plasmids included not only ARGs present in integron cassette arrays but also those located outside integron regions. These effects were consistently observed across diverse incompatibility groups, host genera, and plasmid size ranges. Aminoglycoside resistance genes were found to be the most abundant both inside and outside integron regions, while beta-lactam, tetracycline, macrolide, and quinolone resistance genes were mostly found outside integron regions on integron-positive plasmids. We also observed the same ARG accumulation on integron-positive plasmids and lack of ARG accumulation on integron-negative plasmids from the same sampling sites by analyzing 32 long-read sequenced plasmids of Escherichia coli isolates collected from human and pig wastewater. This finding can reject the alternative explanation that integrons were co-selected with multi-ARG plasmids under the same antibiotic pressure. Our findings provide insights into the structural contexts underlying the accumulation of multiple ARGs on plasmids, which may inform new directions for future antimicrobial resistance surveillance and mitigation strategies.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Polycomb Response Elements (PREs) are specialized tethering elements that mediate chromatin loops and are bound by transcription factors like GAGA-associated factor (GAF), contributing to the recruitment of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. While both PcG proteins and GAF have been implicated in looping, their specific roles and the mechanisms of loop specificity remain unresolved. Using genome-wide and locus-specific approaches, we show that high GAF occupancy is required for chromatin looping and gene regulation. However, GAF alone cannot establish loops without additional factors. Surprisingly, PRE looping does not require the PcG subunit Polyhomeotic (PH) or the repressive histone marks H3K27me3. Intriguingly, orthologous PRE sequences can rescue looping, while unrelated PREs with similar GAF levels cannot. This indicates that looping specificity depends on both GAF levels and compatible factor combinations at loop anchors. Our results support a combinatorial model in which GAF collaborates with additional looping factors, to drive PRE-specific interactions. We propose the existence of a looping code as a mechanistic basis that might explain why only a subset of PREs form loops and contribute to Polycomb-mediated gene silencing.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

We conducted a comprehensive comparison of three EV isolation methods: ultracentrifugation (UC), PEG-based precipitation (Q), and immunoaffinity capture (M) to evaluate their impact on EV yield, purity, and molecular composition. Salivary EVs from healthy volunteers were analysed using proteomic and small-RNA sequencing approaches. Principal component analysis revealed clear isolation method-dependent clustering, where M-derived EVs displayed the most distinct profile. UC and Q produced broader proteomic repertoires with higher total protein content, whereas M-isolated EVs exhibited greater purity and enrichment of trafficking- and lysosome-associated proteins. Over 731 miRNAs selected, 28 were consistently altered across methods and 65 uniquely enriched in M isolates. RT-qPCR confirmed key directional trends. These 93 method-dependent miRNAs have predicted targets associated with synaptic structure and neurodegenerative pathways.

Moreover, this AA method is not fully reversible, limiting studies of dynamic cellular processes that require transient perturbation and functional restoration. To overcome these constraints, we developed an alternative AA system that uses the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) to induce conditional association of the target to its cytoplasmic anchor. The ABA-AA system enables efficient and fully reversible depletion of highly abundant nuclear proteins.

Any disturbance such as fire degrades forest habitats by increasing canopy openness, reducing tree basal area, and eliminating large, cavity-bearing trees providing shelter for many species. In Madagascar, fire has become a prominent disturbance, yet the mechanisms linking fire disturbance to lemur habitat occupation remain poorly understood. Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models, we assessed the effects of forest humidity, temperature, vegetation structural gradients, and tree species richness on lemur occurrence, and evaluated the impact of fire regime parameters on significant abiotic and structural vegetation gradients. Lemur responses varied by body size and ecological specialization. Eulemur fulvus most likely occurred in humid habitats with high floristic diversity. The latter also explained best the presence of Avahi occidentalis and Cheirogaleus medius, while Lepilemur edwardsi was rather connected to dense stands of overstory trees. Small-bodied Microcebus species displayed a higher structural and floristic tolerance. Tree species richness declined sharply in burnt areas and was highest in unburnt forest. Fires impacted vegetation structural gradients, increasing openness and understory density, while old burnt and unburnt forests maintained complex vertical layering. Tree species richness emerged as the strongest predictor of lemur species richness. These results indicate that fire primarily affects lemurs through floristic and structural pathways rather than microclimatic shifts, emphasizing the need to preserve intact forest refugia with mature canopies and species-rich tree communities to sustain lemur diversity under increasing fire pressure in dry forest landscapes of Madagascar.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Pre-exposure induced persistent DNA methylation changes, consistent with priming of CSR and ion-homeostasis pathways. We identified enhanced copper-tolerance in the gill microbiota of primed fish that likely also contributed to host tolerance.

Through maximum-likelihood estimation, it identifies the regime that best explains observed changes along a lineage from an ancestral sequence. RegEvol corrects biases that affected previous tests based on machine learning of transcription factor binding, while remaining conservative across different levels of divergence.

Like other vertebrates, zebrafish also has two gonadotropins and respective receptors. However, while zebrafish FSH activates Fshr specifically, its LH can activate both Fshr and Lhcgr, suggesting three signaling pathways - the canonical FSH-Fshr and LH-Lhcgr pathways, and a non-canonical LH-Fshr pathway. To dissect functional roles of these pathways, we generated a series of zebrafish mutants lacking one to all four genes encoding the two ligands and their receptors: fshb, lhb, fshr, and lhcgr. Single mutants confirmed the essential roles of FSH and LH in zebrafish reproduction. Double mutants demonstrated the functionality of all three pathways, especially the non-canonical LH-Fshr pathway, and highlighted the importance of Fshr in mediating both FSH and LH actions. Transcriptome analysis of double mutant follicles (infertile lhb-/-;lhcgr-/- with FSHFshr and fertile fshb-/-;lhcgr-/- with LH-Fshr) revealed potential molecular mechanisms underlying LH stimulation of oocyte maturation and ovulation via Fshr. Triple mutants revealed spontaneous, ligand-independent activities of Fshr and Lhcgr, in supporting spermatogenesis. Males with only fshb or lhb were infertile, with testes dominated by spermatogonia and spermatocytes with few spermatozoa. The quadruple mutant (fshb-/-;lhb-/-;fshr-/-;lhcgr-/-) displayed an all-male phenotype with underdeveloped, infertile gonads primarily containing spermatogonia, suggesting a critical role for gonadotropins in sex differentiation and gonadal development.

Here, we present a case study on the freshwater mussel Anodonta anatina (Bivalvia: Unionidae), evaluating two preservation methods, six DNA extraction protocols, and two post-extraction clean-up steps for their effects on DNA quality and PacBio HiFi sequencing yield from a single individual. The PacBio Nanobind and CTAB protocols produced high-quality DNA from fresh foot tissue but performed poorly on flash-frozen tissue, which is the most common preservation method. Post-extraction clean-up generally degraded DNA and did not improve sequencing yield.

It generated high DNA quantity and purity, sufficient integrity for HiFi sequencing, and effective contaminant removal.

PR65 is a uniquely flexible and stable molecule composed of 15 tandem HEAT (Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3-PP2A-TOR1) repeats. We characterized the binding sites and interactions of two SMAPs ATUX-8385 and DT-061 with PR65 and evaluated effects on PR65 structural dynamics using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. We initiated SMAP-bound PR65 simulations starting from two binding sites: S1, determined by cryo-electron microscopy for DT-061 bound to PP2A, on the inner helices of the HEAT repeats 2 and 3 (2i and 3i); and S2, predicted by docking of ATUX-8385 onto PR65, on 4i and 5i and outer helices 5o and 6o consistent with footprinting experiments. S2 proved to be a stable site for both SMAPs when initiating the simulations at S2. However, neither DT-061 nor ATUX-8385 demonstrated stable binding to S1. DT-061 rapidly dissociated from S1 to settle instead at a neighboring site S4 overlapping with our previously identified S3 for PR65 in extended form, suggesting that binding to S1 may be a 2-step process: an initial binding to PR65 alone, either to S3/S4 or S2, followed by movement to S3/S4, and then an induced relocation to S1 upon complexation with the regulatory and catalytic subunits. Targeted in silico mutagenesis showed that mutations at S2 and S4 destabilized SMAP binding to the PR65 (subunit). Heterotrimeric PP2A simulations showed that S3 and S4 binding were not persistent upon complexation. Together, these results corroborate our findings. Furthermore, preferentially stabilized a relatively extended PR65 conformation that would accommodate, if not promote, the assembly of the catalytic and regulatory subunits to prompt the activation of the trimeric phosphatase.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "A popular way to model contact interactions in musculoskeletal simulations uses Hertz theory applied to contact spheres, with Hunt Crossley based dissipation. Suitable contact parameters for dynamic simulations will be highly dependent on the morphology, scale, materials, and movement in question. Inappropriate parameter choices can manifest in unpredictable ways during simulations, potentially resulting in misinterpretations or failed simulations. Here, I demonstrate that both the plane strain modulus and the dissipation parameters are not scale invariant. I derive equations to scale the contact parameters in dimensionless form, which allows accounting for differences in body size, number of legs, contact sphere radius, and number of spheres per foot. As a demonstration of this scaling approach, I scale the contact parameters of a 62 kg human to a 500 kg human, a mouse (0.02 kg), an emu (37.8 kg), a horse (545 kg), and a giraffe (1190 kg), and demonstrate that geometrically and dynamically similar contact behaviour is achieved in all cases. The scaling approach presented here can be used to scale parameters known to work for one model to a completely different model, which is particularly useful in studies that simulate the effects of allometric scaling. I also provide equations to estimate suitable contact parameters for a model directly, without using a different model as a starting point. The limitations of Hertz Hunt Crossley contact models in biomechanical simulations are discussed. Lastly, I derive dimensionless expressions and scaling guidelines for the smoothed contact force implementation \"SmoothSphereHalfSpaceForce'' in the popular biomechanical simulator OpenSim.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Although initial chain collapse can precede structure formation, the two processes invariably appear coupled at later stages of folding. This raises the question of whether the fraction of molecules that undergo initial collapse, as well as the degree of coupling between compaction and structure formation later during folding, are regulated by sequence-encoded structural constraints. To examine this, the folding of the small protein monellin was investigated using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (trFRET) analyzed with the maximum entropy method to resolve sub-populations of molecules with native-like and unfolded-like dimensions. Mutation of Pro41 to Ala, or Pro93 to Ala, which relieve local backbone rigidity, selectively stabilized hidden minor conformations within the initial and later intermediate ensembles, respectively. In each case, the minor conformation had a segment that was more compact than in the major one, and its stabilization increased the number of molecules undergoing specific contraction to form the intermediate ensemble, without altering the extent of structure formation. Consequently, sub-populations within these intermediate ensembles could undergo chain contraction independently of structure formation. These findings identify intermediate-state heterogeneity, modifiable by backbone rigidity, as the basis for tunable coupling between chain compaction and structure formation during protein folding.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

For biophysical problems, such as protein folding and association, a fundamental question in diffusion-based methods is how their learned functions correspond to thermodynamics. In this paper, we study diffusion models through the lens of theoretical biophysics, analyzing their underlying formulation of potentials and exploring their applications in scoring protein interactions. We develop simple theories rooted in statistical physics that relate thermodynamic potentials to the negative log of the probability of observing a system in a particular state. We include dimensional analysis of diffusion model equations, and a table mapping AI and physics jargon. We then test a diffusion model's ability to capture learned energies as negative log-likelihood values, -log p0(x0), by integrating over the diffusion-generated path or a probability flow ODE path. We test these integrals on a simple 1D Gaussian mixture diffusion model and a protein-docking diffusion model, DFMDock. In the 1D case, we find that integration over both diffusion and flow paths can accurately recover ground truth probabilities. When we extract the learned docking energies for cases where DFMDock succeeds, we observe energy funnels with the minimum energy near the experimental docked structure, like those we observe with Rosetta, an empirically tuned physics-based biomolecular modeling suite. The learned energy performs comparably or outperforms Rosetta interface energy in 6 out of 25 cases at ranking the correctness of docked poses. These data show that we can extract a relevant learned energy function from a diffusion model and compare it to physical energy functions.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

The uncharred, desiccated grains exhibited uneven preservation: while some retained isotopic values akin to fresh millet, others showed evidence of nitrogen loss due to diagenesis. High d15N values point to intensive manuring, highlighting millet's agricultural significance during the Iron Age. Combining isotopic data with FTIR-ATR analysis allowed the detection of diagenetic impacts and underscored the importance of cross-disciplinary approaches in archaeobotanical studies.

P.; Jatkar, D. D.; Ali Al-Radhawi, M.; Ernst, E. A.; Sontag, E. D.", "abstract": "Minimal synthesis of Boolean functions is an NP-hard problem, and heuristic approaches typically give suboptimal circuits. However, in the emergent field of synthetic biology, genetic logic designs that use even a single additional Boolean gate can render a circuit unimplementable in a cell. This has led to a renewed interest in the field of optimal multilevel Boolean synthesis. For small numbers (1-4) of inputs, an exhaustive search is possible, but this is impractical for large circuits. In this work, we demonstrate that even though it is challenging to build a database of optimal implementations for anything larger than 4-input Boolean functions, a database of 4-input optimal implementations can be used to greatly reduce the number of logical gates required in larger heuristic logic synthesis implementations. The proposed algorithm combines the heuristic results with an optimal implementation database and yields average improvements in fractional gate-count reduction relative to ABC of 5.16% for 5-input circuits and 4.54% for 6-input circuits on outputs provided by the logic synthesis tool ABC. In addition to the gains in the efficiency of the implemented circuits, this work also attests to the importance and practicality of the field of optimal synthesis, even if it cannot directly provide results for larger circuits. The focus of this work is on circuits made exclusively of 2-input NOR gates but the presented results are readily applicable to 2-input NAND circuits as well as (2-input) AND/NOT circuits. The framework proposed here is likely to be adaptable to other types of circuits. Moreover, a small computational pipeline is provided for integration with synthetic biology tools such as Cello.

We functionally expressed a thermophilic 23BD pathway in this organism resulting in a 23BD titer of 19.7 mM from cellulose, representing a metabolic yield of 24%. We used a cell-free systems biology approach to identify limiting steps in the 23BD pathway, revealing that exogenous 23BD dehydrogenase (BDH) activity was essential for production, while native acetolactate synthase (ALS) and acetolactate decarboxylase (ALDC) activities were present but limiting in the parent strain. This approach also revealed redox balance limitations. We demonstrated that this improved understanding of redox balance limitations could be used to increase 23BD titer in vivo, showing that adding acetate could be used to increase 23BD yield. This work establishes a foundation for developing C. thermocellum into a robust platform for 23BD production directly from cellulose and highlights the utility of cell-free systems for guiding metabolic engineering in non-model organisms.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Coral seeding devices (CSDs) - tools designed to deliver sexually propagated corals to target locations - offer a promising means to increase coral abundance on degraded reefs. However, evaluating CSD effectiveness for coral reef restoration across wide areas and over many years is limited by the lack of robust and efficient monitoring approaches. Large-area reef imagery offers an attractive potential solution, but manual detection of CSDs within imagery is slow and limits the scalability of CSD monitoring. 2. We investigated whether machine learning classifiers could accurately detect CSDs in reef orthoimages and tested the performance of classifiers created following minimal manual annotation effort. Using freely available software, we first evaluated classifier performance in a single-site experiment using an orthoimage containing 989 CSDs deployed in Palau. We then also evaluated performance in a multi-site experiment using orthoimages containing a different CSD design deployed across seven sites in the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia. 3. In Experiment 1, classifiers trained on just 30 CSDs annotated within 10 minutes achieved mean recall and precision of 96.7% and 97.1% respectively, reducing manual annotation time by 95.6% whilst still detecting 98.8% of the number of devices found manually. Larger training sets yielded less reliable classifiers and required more manual effort. In Experiment 2, classifiers trained on 30 CSD annotations from one site performed excellently across seven orthoimages from multiple reefs, achieving mean recall and precision of 99.2% and 93.3%. 4. We present evidence that CSD classifiers can be highly effective across both single- and multi-site CSD deployments.

Deciphering these dynamics is key to understanding microbial ecology and advancing biotechnological applications. Here, we use the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to study genomic signatures of adaptation across a broad range of environments and to illustrate how population-level data can inform targeted bioprospecting for industrial traits. Whole-genome and phenotypic analyses of 126 isolates from natural and anthropogenic environments reveal a complex population structure in this species, shaped by both niche specialization and admixture events. Structured lineages exhibit ecological filtering, reduced genetic diversity, and distinct gene content, consistent with adaptation to substrates like dairy, hydrocarbons, or industrial substrates. In contrast, admixed populations display greater genetic diversity and broader phenotypic capacity, including enhanced stress tolerance and metabolic flexibility. Genome plasticity, reflected in pangenome and CNV variation, aligns with ecological origin, while trait assays link phenotypic divergence to underlying genetic variation. For instance, better growth performance on acetate, an ecological and industrially relevant trait, is associated with hydrocarbon-adapted strains and likely linked to variation in regulatory regions of acetate metabolism genes. Together, our results reflect how divergent evolutionary trajectories, ranging from ecological specialization to genomic plasticity through admixture, underpin the species ecological success and provide a framework for harnessing its natural diversity in microbial bioprospecting.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Despite a growing number of documented cases of admixture in nature, relatively little is known about how mosaic patterns of ancestry vary simultaneously across the genome and among multiple populations or lineages of hybridizing species. Here, using pooled whole-genome sequence data from more than 20 populations representing three nominal species and multiple admixed or taxonomically ambiguous populations, we show that widespread admixture in Lycaeides butterflies has resulted in distinct evolutionary histories within and among chromosomes, with the most notable differences between the autosomes and the Z sex chromosome. Many populations exhibit substantial evidence of mixed ancestry on the autosomes, whereas the Z chromosome shows a more tree-like evolutionary history. In some cases, the predominant ancestry of the autosomes and the Z chromosome differ. We also find evidence of variation in ancestry within chromosomes, though this appears more idiosyncratic. We also show that differences in autosomal versus Z-chromosome ancestry have the potential to shape ecologically important trait variation. Specifically, using genome-wide association mapping, we demonstrate that wing-pattern elements--traits known to influence mate preference--are affected by genetic variants on both the autosomes and the Z chromosome. In sum, our results show that different chromosomes can exhibit distinct evolutionary histories, with the Z chromosome suggesting more discrete evolutionary lineages or species than the autosomes.

Interestingly, zina-1 is pseudogenized in most non-Hawaiian strains, while sept-1 evolves from a toxic to a non-toxic form through sequence divergence. Phylogenetic studies found that sept-1/zina-1 is the most ancestral TA system among the three known ones, and its loss preceded the rise of sup-35/pha-1.

Here, we assembled a large-scale genome dataset encompassing 243 embryophyte species and 12 representative algal species to test the hypothesis of bryophyte monophyly. Across different substitution models and species tree inference methods, we recover strong support for bryophyte monophyly in the presence of algal outgroups; by varying the algal outgroup sampling, we revealed a salient outgroup effect that can significantly alter the embryophyte deep divergence relationship. We show that (1) bryophyte monophyly is consistently supported across three distinct outgroup-free rooting methods; and (2) incomplete lineage sorting, substitution saturation, heterogeneous site and branch profiles through deep time underpin prevalent phylogenomic discordance across genes and sites. Our data explain decades of difficulty in resolving the deep dichotomy of land plants.

However, performance on downstream tasks is sensitive to tokenization strategies reflecting the complex encodings in DNA, where both regulatory elements and single-nucleotide changes can be functionally significant. Yet existing models are fixed to their initial tokenization strategy; single-nucleotide encodings result in long sequences that challenge transformer architectures, while fixed multi-nucleotide schemes like byte pair encoding struggle with character level modeling. Drawing inspiration from the Byte Latent Transformer's combining of bytes into patches, we propose that `patching' provides a competitive and more efficient alternative to tokenization for DNA sequences. Furthermore, patching eliminates the need for a fixed vocabulary, which offers unique advantages to DNA. Leveraging this, we propose a biologically informed strategy, using evolutionary conservation scores as a guide for `patch' boundaries. By prioritizing conserved regions, our approach directs computational resources to the most functionally relevant parts of the DNA sequence. We show that models up to an order of magnitude smaller surpass current state-of-the-art performance in existing DNA benchmarks.

Diseases of the gastric mucosa such as gastric ulcers are highly prevalent in equids, particularly amongst racing thoroughbreds, and present a significant challenge to animal health and welfare. Despite this, there is currently no lab-based model capable of accurately representing the cellular diversity and cellular interactions within the equine gastric mucosa to aid in development of treatment options. We present here the first report of equine gastric organoids derived from glandular mucosa tissue. Through bulk RNA-sequencing and immunofluorescence we show these gastric organoids are representative of the tissue whilst retaining the individual gene-expression properties of the animal they were derived from. We also show these organoids are stable over multiple passages and can be differentiated towards different cell-types to upregulate protein and gene expression of specialised cell markers such as gastric foveolar cell associated mucin 5ac, gastrokine 1 & 2 and trefoil factor 2. This model establishes the first physiologically relevant in vitro model of the equine gastric epithelium, representing a significant opportunity for developing understanding and therapeutic treatments of gastric diseases in equids.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we (1) evaluate the current level of protection for elasmobranchs, (2) employ CAPTAIN reinforcement learning algorithm to identify areas that optimise conservation based on species level of threat and their functional and evolutionary distinctiveness, and (3) examine conservation conflicts and opportunities by identifying areas where conservation priorities overlap with high and low fishing pressures. Our analysis revealed severe protection deficits, with elasmobranchs having on average only 3% of their range covered by no-take MPAs and 64% of species under-represented relative to random expectations. Areas that optimise conservation priorities consistently converged in Australian, Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Africa, European Atlantic coasts, the Caribbean, and South American Atlantic regions. However, areas of highest conservation priority often coincided with intensive fishing, particularly in East Asian seas, highlighting conservation conflicts requiring strategic management.

Complex polysaccharides, like chitin or starch, require the secretion of enzymes that degrade these resources into smaller units before they can be consumed. However, exoenzymes and the products they create are public goods, meaning they can be used by competitors, called cheaters, who benefit from public goods even if they do not produce enzymes themselves. Here, we test the hypothesis that antibiotics produced by Streptomyces are used to privatize public goods by restricting access to resource cheaters. Using experiments with Streptomyces coelicolor and Bacillus subtilis, we first show that B. subtilis cheating significantly reduces S. coelicolor fitness on complex medium (starch) but not on a simple carbon source (maltose) which does not require exoenzyme secretion. Next, we show that antibiotics produced by S. coelicolor markedly increase fitness against resource cheaters, despite evidence that antibiotic production is metabolically costly. Finally, we find that the benefits of antibiotic production and the costs of resource cheating are both higher during growth on lower resource concentrations. Our results provide novel insights into the context-dependent costs and benefits of antibiotic secretion in Streptomyces and highlight the role of resource complexity and concentration in mediating competitive strategies in bacteria.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

F.; Cogni, R.", "abstract": "Using spatiotemporal sampling to understand evolutionary changes over time is highly effective, particularly to gain insights into changes driven by environmental shifts. The latitudinal clines in Drosophila melanogaster in North America provide an excellent system for studying temporal changes. Due to D. melanogaster's short generational times, it is possible to observe changes spanning up to 100 generations within a single decade. Using temporal samples across the latitudinal transect could shed light on the processes responsible for the establishment and maintenance of those clines, and help to disentangle demographic and selective forces. To do this, we used pool-seq to obtain genomewide data of 16 new D. melanogaster natural populations collected along the North American east coast from 1997 to 2023. Our data suggest that there has been a homogenization over time. Consistent with this, we observed a reduction in the number of clinal single nucleotide polymorphisms. Polymorphisms that remained clinal had smaller slopes on chromosome 3R, aligned with the reduction in slope of inversions In(3R)Payne and In(3R)Mo. Clinal SNPs tended to be lost more frequently in genomic regions with higher recombination rates, and clinal SNPs identified in 2009/2010 were enriched in functional classes with greater phenotypic impact relative to those from 1997. We also investigated signs of selective sweeps that were shared among locations using a window FST approach, which corroborated previously found signals of selection in the insecticide resistance-linked region of the P450 gene family. Overall, the results indicate that gene flow gradually reduces clinality over time, while the remaining clinal loci are likely shaped by spatially varying selection. Together, these findings highlight how gene flow and selection jointly shape spatial genomic patterns over time in natural populations.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

However, the extent and persistence of these effects remain debated. Here, we assess the impact of immigrant mammal groups on native South American mammal diversity by combining an extensive fossil dataset (6,214 occurrences; 1,739 species) with deep learning methods and time-series analyses to model dynamics of mammalian biodiversity throughout the Cenozoic. The arrival of African and North American lineages increased the overall species richness in the continent but also contributed to a decline in native diversity. Additionally, our models suggest that the negative effect of immigrant lineages on native diversity was strongest immediately after their arrival and initial diversification, but this effect lessened over time. Overall, these findings support a scenario where immigration simultaneously enriched South American faunas and triggered a time-decaying replacement of native lineages, reshaping continental biodiversity.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Using summary statistics and full likelihood, we detect pervasive asymmetric introgression between two sympatric Amazonian species clouding phylogenetic relationships in this group. However, these introgression results are sensitive to the assumed species tree. When assuming the Z-chromosome phylogeny as the species tree, the landscape of introgression is non-random; introgression is negatively associated with chromosome length, elevated at macrochromosome ends, and near zero for the Z-chromosome (the avian sex chromosome). A pseudo-autosomal region on the Z-chromosome, which recombines homologously with that of the W-chromosome, shows elevated introgression comparable to that of autosomes. Our results resolve the species tree of tinamous and imply a history of linked selection purging migrant alleles that are deleterious in the hybrid genome. This selection is countered in regions of the genome expected to experience elevated recombination, allowing introgressed alleles to accumulate across >20% of the genome. This work demonstrates a genome-architecture-aware approach to resolving the species tree in the face of introgression. As chromosome-level reference genomes spanning the tree of life become increasingly available, phylogenomic studies would benefit from the adoption of genome-architecture-aware approaches like ours.

Deciphering how these dynamics modulate the effect of regulatory variants on agronomically important traits remains largely unexplored in farmed animals. In this work, we focused on the pig skeletal muscle. We integrated chromatin accessibility, molecular QTL and GWAS data to identify developmental stage-specific regulatory elements and to highlight putative causal regulatory variants underlying complex traits. We aggregated 202 publicly available ATAC-seq libraries, from four different studies, spanning fetal and postnatal (piglet) stages, processed them through the nf-core ATAC-seq pipeline, obtained the consensus peaks, and performed differential accessibility analysis to define stage-differential open chromatin regions. These peaks were intersected with five classes of cis-acting molecular QTLs (molQTLs) from the PigGTEx resource, followed by functional enrichment analysis, promoter-focused functional annotation, and integration with gene-trait pairs. Finally, we intersected the eGenes (i.e., genes whose expression is regulated by at least one cis-eQTL) to link variants previously associated with QTLs for production traits. We identified 132,275 differentially accessible peaks (DAPs) separating fetal from piglet muscle. Fetal DAPs were enriched in promoter and intergenic regions, whereas piglet DAPs were enriched in intronic regions, plausibly reflecting a shift from transcriptional priming to postnatal regulatory refinement. Across all molQTL classes, overlaps with accessible regions were highly significant (p < 0.001). The top 25% strongest effect variants were enriched within DAPs, exhibiting promoter-TSS enrichment in fetuses and intronic enrichment in piglets, with the top 1% of eQTLs predominating in the fetal stage (14 fetal vs. 4 piglet). Gene Ontology analysis of promoter-accessible eGenes revealed prenatal enrichment for RNA metabolism and chromatin organization, contrasting with the postnatal enrichment for muscle contraction and lipid metabolism. Interestingly, the intersection of promoter eGenes with previously colocalized growth, muscle, and reproductive traits identified 107 fetal-stage and 30 piglet-stage associated regulatory elements, with only three eGenes shared between stages. Together, these findings demonstrate that combining stage-differential chromatin accessibility and regulatory variants is a useful way to prioritise putative causal variants for complex traits in pigs, and could help to refine precision breeding strategies.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Using 73,472 representative bacterial genomes, we establish a multi-scale quantitative framework revealing systematic, hierarchical relationships between taxonomic identity and nitrogen cycling functional potential. Hierarchical variance decomposition reveals that taxonomy explains 20-46% of functional variation across six nitrogen pathways, with the strongest constraints for dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium (46.1%) and nitrogen fixation (44.2%), both negatively correlated with functional prevalence. K-means clustering identifies four class-level functional archetypes (Functionally Inactive, Diversified, Integrated, and Specialized) among 77 bacterial classes. 1,281 genera resolve into five ecological strategies differentiated by their nitrogen retention versus loss capabilities, exhibiting strong phylogenetic signals. Cross-scale validation demonstrates 78.7% genus-level conformity to class-level archetypes, confirming hierarchical functional organization. Molecular evolutionary analysis of 13 genes reveals sequence conservation as a dimension partially independent of pathway-level functional constraints. Paradoxically, the functionally most constrained pathway exhibits only moderate sequence conservation (nrfA: 9th/13 genes), while a moderately constrained pathway shows exceptional conservation (napA). Four constraint-conservation patterns demonstrate that gene-specific structural and ecological factors generate evolutionary rate variation independently of taxonomic associations. Our results establish a hierarchical framework in which taxonomic constraints set baseline functional potential, ecological trade-offs shape strategy diversification, and molecular evolution modulates gene-level conservation patterns across biological scales. This framework establishes quantitative baselines that enable probabilistic inference of nitrogen cycling capabilities from taxonomic composition, with potential applications in amplicon-based community analysis, targeted cultivation, and biogeochemical modeling.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Trained on large multi-cohort datasets and interpreted using SHAP analysis, ATHENA not only stratifies patients by clinical outcomes but also predicts which specific mutations alter tumor behavior and therapy response, enabling direct validation through base editing experiments. Applied to prostate cancer progression models, the OncoVar-ATHENA framework identified stage-specific driver signatures across castration-resistant, AR-variant-driven, and metastatic disease, and uncovered cooperative interactions such as SYVN1-STC2 that promote tumor proliferation.

Recently, NLRP10 has been shown to form an inflammasome, however, the mechanism and the trigger of activation remain elusive. Here, we show that in human epithelial cells and keratinocytes NLRP10 oligomerises in response to the stressor m-3M3FBS. NLRP10 co-localises with ASC upon overexpression, but ASC nucleation and recruitment were different to other NLRPs. While neither ATP hydrolysis nor the pyrin domain were required, the C-terminal tail region (aa 584-655) was both necessary and sufficient for oligomerisation. Generation of chimeric proteins showed that the function of the tail is conserved between human and mouse NLRP10 in respect to aggregation but convers different protein stability. Changes in the subcellular localisation of NLRP10 and oligomerization were dependent on the presence of evolutionarily conserved lysine residues in the tail region, which localise the majority of NLRP10 at lipid droplets. Our study identifies the C-terminal basic tail of NLRP10 as a key regulatory element for oligomerisation and localisation at lipid interfaces.

Yet, little is known about how their gut microbiota vary across geographic regions or whether microbial exchange occurs with managed honey bees (Apis mellifera), which are often kept in close proximity. Using full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing of individual bees sampled from 167 colonies, we characterized gut microbial community structure through a hierarchical, taxonomic and phylogenetic comparative framework, contrasting the microbiota of Melipona quadrifasciata and Melipona mondury with that of Apis mellifera across their shared geographic range in Brazil. The core microbiota of Melipona was dominated by Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Apilactobacillus, Bombella, and Floricoccus, and showed inverse variation in relative abundance with lower-prevalence bacterial taxa. Although the core microbiota of the two stingless bee species overlapped only partially with that of Apis mellifera, they exhibited comparable alpha-diversity and beta-diversity dispersion, indicating broadly similar community assembly processes and dynamics. Nevertheless, we found that 6% of all amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were shared between hosts, encompassing nearly all canonical honey bee core symbionts, indicating frequent spillover. Remarkably, several ASVs of Snodgrassella, a genus typically rare in stingless bees, reached high abundance in several M. quadrifasciata individuals and formed a deeply divergent clade (~96% 16S rRNA gene identity to S. alvi). These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that human-mediated management practices, such as mixed apiaries and artificial feeding, create opportunities for microbial exchange between native and non-native bees.

These are interlocked within continually evolving genetic conflicts that are characterized by extremely rapid dynamics of change in both sequence and copy number. Indeed, it was shown that across Drosophila, the core RNAi machinery evolves under positive selection, and that the RNAi effector AGO2 has additional copies in some species. This contrasts with the core microRNA (miRNA) machinery in Drosophila, which evolves under negative selection and maintains one-to-one orthologs not only amongst flies, but even to mammals. Here, we analyze >300 long read genome assemblies of Drosophila species to generalize these attributes. Not only do we find recurrent expansion of AGO2 across ~100 species, including lineages with ongoing amplification of AGO2, we also find dozens of species with extra copies of the other core RNAi factors, r2d2 and dicer-2. In many cases, these additional RNAi factor copies co-exist, or are nested, within a lineage bearing an ancestral expansion of AGO2. Transcriptome data provide evidence that core RNAi factors, including certain lineage-specific copies, are biased for testis expression. Finally, we use small RNA data to annotate hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs) in D. pseudoobscura, one of the species with prominent amplification of RNAi factors. We find rampant de novo hpRNA loci in this species, whose siRNAs are predominantly expressed in testis. All together, these findings highlight evolutionary plasticity of the fly RNAi pathway and affirm that it is preferentially deployed in the germline of the heterogametic sex. When considered alongside abundant genetic data for recurrent sex ratio meiotic drive against the Y chromosome, these genomic data strongly imply that a fundamental role of endogenous RNAi is to control sex chromosome conflicts.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

In animals, the most prominent systems include PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and Krppel-associated box zinc finger proteins (KZFPs). Because both systems recognize TEs in a sequence-specific manner and induce epigenetic silencing, they appear functionally redundant at first glance. However, KZFPs are a relatively recent innovation that emerged and diversified in genomes where the piRNA pathway was already established. This raises an important question: under what conditions can a second, seemingly redundant defense system invade and persist? To address this, we constructed a mathematical model integrating the evolutionary dynamics of TEs, piRNAs, and KZFPs. Our approach focuses on a key mechanistic asymmetry between the two defense systems: whereas piRNA-mediated repression is dependent on TE activity, KZFPs provide constitutive suppression that does not rely on ongoing TE activity. We show that these distinct modes of action generate interactions that extend beyond simple redundancy or additivity. We derive analytical conditions under which KZFPs can invade a pre-existing TEpiRNA equilibrium and characterize the evolutionary logic that enables stable coexistence of these multilayered defense strategies. Together, our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding how complex, layered genome defense systems can evolve and persist.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

However, high genotyping costs remain a challenge. This study aimed to determine the optimal marker density in genome coverage, to maximize GS accuracy and precision of heritability estimates for growth and wood quality traits. Thousands of SNPs representative of the exome of three major spruce species were used: 18,275 SNPs for black spruce (representing 10,894 distinct gene loci), 11,328 SNPs for white spruce (8647 gene loci), and 116,765 SNPs for Norway spruce (20,695 gene loci). For each species, a similar experimental design was used with related full-sib families replicated on two sites, and GBLUP prediction models were developed. The effect of varying the number of SNPs was examined by re-sampling subsets from 500 to 100,000 SNPs. Results indicated that plateaus in heritability estimates were reached as the marker density increased, stabilizing between 4000 to 8000 SNPs for a spruce genome size of around 2000 centimorgans, a trend consistent across all traits and species. Predictive ability and prediction accuracy both increased with the number of SNPs up to a similar level, beyond which further improvements were marginal. Such optimal marker density should be financially attainable for most spruce breeding programs, striking a balance between the need for maximizing accuracy and that for minimizing genotyping costs. These findings should support the further deployment of GS in conifer breeding programs, with high selection precision and by reducing the financial burden of very high-density SNP coverage, even for conifers characterized by large giga-genomes.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Z.; Bao, C.; Albesa-Gonzalez, A.; Li, L.; Clopath, C.; Erlich, J. C.", "abstract": "Across psychology, economics, and decision science, it is well established that choosing a good internal representation can make complex problems easier to solve. This idea, central to theories of bounded rationality and heuristics, suggests that intelligent behavior depends not only on what is stored in working memory, but on the format in which it is stored. Whether non-human animals flexibly select internal formats, and how such choices are implemented in neural circuits, has remained unclear. Here we show that rats adjust the format of working memory to reduce cognitive load. When a task encourages an action-based code, rats maintain the relevant information as a stable motor plan supported by frontal cortex. When the same task is reformulated to make this code costly, they instead store a sensory trace in auditory cortex. These strategy shifts are rapid and reliable, revealing that rats can switch between distinct neural circuits to store information in the most economical internal format. These results demonstrate that flexible representational selection is not unique to humans but is present in rodents and reflected in circuit-level reallocation of working memory. This establishes a neural basis for classic theories linking problem representation to computational efficiency and provides a path toward a neural circuit-level description of selecting internal formats to reduce cognitive costs.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

T.; Chen, Y.-Y.; Fujitani, S.; Shimada, S.; Koike, S.; Kunii, N.; Saito, N.; Chao, Z. C.", "abstract": "Prediction error refers to the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory input. Its hierarchical organization has been demonstrated through decomposed brain responses in the local-global paradigm, where temporal regularities are established locally at individual stimulus transitions and globally across multi-tone sequence structures. In macaques and marmosets, local and global prediction-error signals have both been found in high-frequency oscillations (60-150 Hz) recorded with ECoG. In humans, however, these signals have primarily been observed in a lower frequency range (30-100 Hz) using EEG. Here, we recorded human ECoG to achieve higher signal fidelity, enabling examination of neural oscillations above 100 Hz (high-frequency activity, HFA), which are believed to be closely linked to local spiking activity. Eight participants listened to auditory sequences that either followed their local and global regularities (local and global standards) or violated them (local and global deviants). Robust HFA responses were observed for the local deviants, but these responses were reduced when the deviants were expected based on the global regularity, indicating both levels of prediction-error processes contribute to the observed activity. Importantly, these HFA responses could be decomposed into two subcomponents: an early component reflecting local prediction-error signals localized to lateral auditory regions, and a late component reflecting global prediction-error signals prominent in both lateral auditory and frontal cortices. Together, these findings demonstrate that neural oscillations above 100 Hz encode hierarchical prediction errors not only in non-human primates but also in humans.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "The temporary storage of visual memories is known to engage early visual cortex (EVC), where mnemonic content is presumed to be stored in weak or latent states. Two mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this storage: Top-down feedback from anterior cortical sites, and short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) traces laid down by previous sensory inputs. Here, we tested if these mechanisms can account for two hallmarks of working memory, namely, the flexible selection of information from working memory, and the robustness of working memory against distraction. Simulating firing rates in a neural network model of working memory, we show that STSP cannot easily account for selection of information from within the working memory store, and is not robust to visual distraction. Rather, any input that passes through the visual system is briefly remembered, irrespective of its relevance. In contrast, top-down feedback can establish durable mnemonic signals in EVC that reflect currently task-relevant working memory contents and are robust to distraction. We argue that feedback is a parsimonious explanation for the existence of mnemonic signals in EVC, given that the storage of working memories is distributed across a hierarchy of cortical sites, which are known to have widespread feedback projections to visual cortex.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed deepRetinotopy toolbox, a deep learning-based application for predicting topographic organization of the human visual cortex from cortical anatomy. We show that our toolbox accurately predicts retinotopic organization using only standard structural MRI scans acquired under diverse conditions, including varying imaging sites and scanner types. We then demonstrate that predicted maps can be leveraged to automatically generate individual-specific visual area boundaries, overcoming common biases in manual annotations. Finally, we estimate age-related changes in visual cortex organization by retrospectively applying our method to 11,060 anatomical scans, revealing that group differences in primary visual cortex organization are predictable from cortical anatomy.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Here, we chart the trajectory of dural immune development, uncovering a distinctive function for the murine dura as a transient niche for B lymphopoiesis in the early-postnatal window. Shared embryonic progenitors initiate dural B cell development in concert with a multi-organ wave of extramedullary lymphopoiesis that contributes distinctively to the peripheral B cell pool. In the dura, B cells develop locally in discrete sinus-proximal foci, occupying an anatomically defined and developmentally restricted fibroblast niche. Sinus-proximal fibroblasts express the pro-hematopoietic chemokine CXCL12, and local deletion of this crucial factor severely impairs dural B lymphopoiesis. These data reveal a critical function for dural fibroblasts in shaping the early-life B cell compartment and provide a model for how extramedullary niches may support early-life leukocyte production.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}

Although displaying a high degree of conservation in basic morphology, eukaryotic cilia vary extensively in their sizes and functioning. Previously, we showed that an evolutionarily ancient transcription factor, X chromosome-associated protein 5 (Xap5) is required for motile ciliogenesis in unicellular and multicellular organisms. Here we show that Xap5 functions as the master regulator of primary ciliogenesis. Xap5 associates with the nuclear protein Non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (Nono) to form a regulatory module that directly binds and activates the transcription factors Sox5 and Sox9. Genetic ablation of Xap5 or Nono impairs primary ciliogenesis, and loss of Sox5 disrupts the downstream ciliogenic program, consistent with the established role of Sox9. Collectively, our results provide new insight into how complex ciliary transcription factors networks determine ciliary diversity during evolution, and will have a profound impact on our understanding of human ciliopathies.", "date": "2025-11-29", "journal": ""}
