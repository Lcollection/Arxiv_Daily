A.; Mouri, K.; Shimizu, K.; Furuichi, T.", "abstract": "In most mammals, female sexual receptivity (estrus) closely coincides with ovulation, providing males with precise fertility signals. However, in some anthropoid primates living in multi-male societies, females display extended receptivity along with exaggerated sexual swellings that probabilistically indicate ovulation. This raises the question about how males successfully time mating, particularly when ovulation is difficult to predict from such cues as seen in bonobos. To address this question, we combined daily variation in swelling size, hormonal profiles, and male mating behaviors. By estimating day-specific ovulation probabilities relative to the onset of the maximal swelling phase and detumescence, we also examined how male efforts correlate with female fertility. Our results revealed that while ovulation probability was widely distributed and difficult to predict when aligned with the onset of the swelling phase, male behavior was closely aligned with the conception probability. Males concentrated mating efforts late in the phase and stopped after detumescence. High-ranking males intervened in copulations involving females with higher conception probabilities, specifically those with maximal swelling and older infants. When multiple females exhibited maximal swelling, males preferentially followed females whose maximal swelling started earlier and who had older infants. Male-male aggression increased when there were more females with maximal swelling. However, this tendency was reversed when male party size exceeded the average. Importantly, our results revealed that the low predictability of ovulation is best explained by inter- and intra-individual variation in the length of maximal swelling phase, rather than ovulation occurring randomly within that phase in bonobos. Males effectively manage such a noisy signal by prioritizing late-phase ovulatory cues and integrating reproductive history, thereby extracting usable timing information. This behavioral mechanism helps explain the persistence of conspicuous yet noisy ovulatory signals in bonobos. Since males are capable of inferring ovulation timing even under noisy conditions, selection may not favor highly precise female signals. Instead, it shifts more of the time and energy costs onto males, allowing conspicuous female traits to be maintained.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we discover and characterize a novel series of compounds that potently and selectively inhibit SMARCA4/SMARCA2. Mutational and biochemical studies demonstrate that these inhibitors act through a unique mode of inhibition, distinct from reported SMARCA4/SMARCA2 inhibitors. Across a range of cancer cell lines, SMARCA4/SMARCA2 inhibition resulted in lineage-specific changes in chromatin accessibility at binding sites for key transcription factors (TFs). In uveal melanoma (UM), BAF inhibition resulted in loss of enhancer occupancy of SOX10 and MITF, two essential TFs, leading to down-regulation of the melanocytic gene expression program. In a mouse xenograft model of UM, SMARCA4/SMARCA2 inhibition was well tolerated and resulted in dose-dependent tumor regression correlating with pharmacodynamic modulation of BAF-target gene expression.

Those viruses cause a wide range of human diseases ranging from mild to severe life-threatening conditions. Host factors, including age, sex, and virus receptor expression, influence infection severity; yet, how sex and age shape the expression of ssRNA virus receptors in the human brain remains unclear. Here, we applied a data-driven computational workflow that integrates sex and age to characterize developmental patterns of ssRNA virus receptors in females and males across the human brain. Using a publicly available transcriptomic dataset spanning the lifespan, we analyzed 67 host receptor genes that mediate viral entry across 10 families of ssRNA viruses. Lifespan trajectories were generated, and high dimensional analyses compared changes between sexes across 15 brain areas (n = 700, F = 306, M = 394; age range: 4 months to 82 years), revealing spatiotemporal patterns of virus receptor expression. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the 2010 trajectories identified 25 different patterns spanning a range of sex bias from female-biased to male-biased expression. Differential expression analysis revealed a brain-wide pattern of sex differences in virus receptor expression during childhood, prior to puberty. Among virus families, Pneumoviridae was the most sexually dimorphic, and cortical brain areas had distinct developmental trajectories for females and males. While females are often described as developing precociously relative to males, our findings show that sex differences in virus receptor expression are not simple linear shifts, but follow complex high-dimensional trajectories, underscoring the importance of incorporating sex as a biological variable in studies of neuroinfectious disease vulnerability.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

In contrast, eukaryotic phytoplankton resources remain limited to model reference genomes or community-level metagenomics, leaving a gap in understanding intraspecific variation and evolutionary processes. To address this, we developed a comprehensive biological and genomic resource for the cosmopolitan and ecologically important genus Bathycoccus. Extensive metagenomic data from across the world Ocean are available for this genus, and previous studies have identified four Bathycoccus species and reconstructed 34 metagenome-assembled genomes. Here we report 28 high-quality strain genome sequences using a combination of Oxford Nanopore Technologies long reads and Illumina short reads and associated biologicalresources. These include 24 Bathycoccus prasinos strains spanning a latitudinal gradient from 40{degrees} to 78{degrees}N, a reference genome for Bathycoccus calidus, and three genomes of the recently identified B3 clade, which we propose as the Bathycoccus catiminus species. Comparative analyses of sequenced genomes with MAGs highlight the complementarity between resources: while MAGs capture environmental diversity and uncover uncultured taxa, the cultured strain genomes provide complete, non-chimeric high-quality assemblies that resolve structural variations and haplotype-level diversity not detected in MAGs. These include the large outlier chromosome (BOC), a putative sexual chromosome revealing a second mating type, and extensive variability in the small outlier chromosome (SOC), associated with viral resistance and genome plasticity. Together, these biological and genomic resources establish Bathycoccus prasinos as a powerful model for studying diversity, adaptation, and evolution of eukaryotic phytoplankton in the ocean, complementing existing global metagenomic datasets.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Our analysis of T1 MRI data from 46,381 UK Biobank participants reveals that simpler machine learning models, and notably those with excessive regularization, demonstrate superior sensitivity to disease-relevant changes compared to their more complex counterparts, despite being less accurate in chronological age prediction. This counterintuitive discovery suggests that models traditionally deemed inferior might, in fact, offer a more meaningful biomarker for brain health by capturing variations pertinent to disease states. These findings challenge the assumption that accuracy-optimized brain-age models serve as useful normative models of brain aging. Optimizing for age accuracy appears misaligned with normative aims: it drives models to rely on low-variance aging features and to deemphasize higher-variance signals that are more informative about brain health and disease. Consequently, we propose a recalibration of focus towards models that, while less accurate in conventional terms, yield brain-age gaps with larger patient-control effect sizes, offering greater utility in early disease detection and understanding the multifaceted nature of brain aging.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Methods: We applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify pathways dysregulated in PSVD. Network construction and visualization were performed in Cytoscape to explore interconnectivity among enriched processes. Within key modules, candidate genes were prioritized by ranking approaches and cross-referenced with findings from previous studies. Results and Conclusion: This study revealed that PSVD is characterized by coordinated dysregulation, with immune and signaling pathways activated alongside the suppression of metabolic, ribosomal, and mitochondrial programs. Alterations in ribosomal proteins, ATP synthase subunits, and serpin family members highlight translational, bioenergetic, and anticoagulant dysfunction as core mechanisms.

During these periods, synapses undergo plastic modification, while neuronal activities are collectively synchronized, accompanied by large shifts in the excitation-inhibition (EI) balance. These phenomena differ from the learning processes that occur during task engagement. However, the detailed mechanism by which synchronized neuronal activity reshapes neural circuits through plasticity is not yet fully understood. The Kuramoto model is used to study the collective synchronization of oscillators, including neurons. We previously proposed the EI-Kuramoto model, in which an EI balance was implemented in the Kuramoto model. The model alters its synchronicity based on the EI balance of the interaction strength. In this study, we further developed the EI-Kuramoto model by implementing Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, leading to a plastic EI-Kuramoto (pEI-Kuramoto) model. Models with robust inhibition consistently showed desynchronization and stable coupling. Contrastingly, weaker inhibition produced bistable synchronization, in which couplings with intermediate strengths fluctuated, whereas the strongest couplings remained stable. Our findings suggest that the dynamic interplay between network activity and plasticity explains why stronger synapses in the brain exhibit greater stability than their weaker counterparts. Moreover, this mechanism facilitated network reorganization during sleep and rest.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

When cultured in Matrigel, de novo polarization of a single epithelial cell is often coupled with mitosis. During mitotic exit, centrosomes move to the future AM site, raising questions about their role in polarization. We perturbed centrosomes and polarity regulators in Matrigel-cultured cells and manipulated polarity direction using suspension culture to examine the relationships among polarization features. Surprisingly, centrosomal microtubules are not essential for centrosome positioning or AM formation, but their absence reduces the efficiency of AM formation. The polarity regulator Par3, rather than AM component trafficking, influences centrosome positioning. In suspension culture, centrosome migrate in the direction opposite to AM formation. Taken together, our findings define the hierarchical relationships among several polarization features and show that centrosome-based polarity is not universal in epithelial cells, providing new insights into the mechanisms of epithelial polarization.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

While previous findings are suggestive of an adaptable mental ruler by which the raw retinal signals are flexibly scaled according to the prevailing context, whether and how such a putative mental ruler is utilized by the visual brain remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that the putative mental ruler was represented by multiple differently-tuned spatial frequency (SF) channels. A finer division of the ruler, signaled by dominance of the high-SF channels, is translated to a wider-spread topography of neural activation via concentration of neuronal receptive fields, causing perceptual inflation. Combining psychophysics and fMRI, we found that modulation of SF channels caused a systematic distortion in perceived separation, a representative fundamental spatial property, and a global displacement of population receptive fields (pRF) in primary visual cortex. Computational modeling further showed that both the perceptual distortion and the global pRF displacement were functionally coupled with the magnitude of SF channel modulation. Our findings reveal, for the first time, an adjustable mental ruler that commonly governs the perception of spatial property information in different contexts, and suggest a cognitive scaling system based on SF channel reweighting and displacement of neuronal RFs.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Controlled irrigation has been proposed as a cultivation method of choice over continuous flooding to reduce water and fertilizer usage in an aerobic environment. However, a systemic understanding of the assembly and function of microbiota in the rhizosphere under drip and flood irrigation remains unclear. Using empirical analyses, we report a significant reduction in methane emissions in controlled irrigation compared to the flooded environment. Genotypic or varietal differences did not influence such methane emissions under conventional flooded cultivation of rice. Using metagenomic sequencing and computational analyses, we provide a deeper understanding of how drip irrigation or continuous flooding affect the root-associated microbiomes in rice. Rhizosphere soil from two different rice varieties, Huanghuazhan and Temasek rice, grown under drip or flood conditions in a greenhouse was collected over 2 months post-transplantation for metagenomic analysis. Our results reveal that drip irrigation favours microbes involved in the nitrifying-denitrifying processes while continuous flooding enriches for methanotrophs and methanogenic archaea. Syntrophic microbiomes associated with methanogenesis were significantly reduced in drip irrigation. Several keystone taxa were evident in the co-occurrence network model related to methanogenic, methanotrophic, nitrifying, sulphur-oxidising and sulphur-reducing activities.

ATM leverages the superior quality and minimal distortion of anatomical MRI and learns from multi-subject datasets to deliver robust, subject-specific streamline bundles with accurate preservation of structural connectivity.

We focused on one of the important repressive histone marks, tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) catalysed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and found that the global level of H3K27me3 is increased in attenuated macrophages. ChIP-seq revealed the genomic distribution of H3K27me3 is heavily remodelled from virulent to attenuated macrophages, where many genes transition from a focal peak of H3K27me3 around the transcription start site to larger chromatin domains. This transition is not paralleled by large-scale transcriptional downregulation.

Here we examined perceptual acceleration during visual temporal integration. Temporal integration occurs when successive stimuli appear that fit together in time as well as space. As such, stimuli arriving first during temporal integration partially predict those that follow. Although temporal integration is a rapid process, we reasoned that this information may cause perceptual acceleration during temporal integration. We used multivariate pattern analysis of EEG data from a missing element task, designed to measure the visual temporal integration of two successive stimulus displays, so that we were able to precisely track the representation associated with the integrated percept in time. We manipulated the delay between our displays, and observed commensurate acceleration of the resultant integrated representation. The degree of acceleration first increased from early (100 ms after stimulus onset) to intermediate (200 ms) processing stages, before decreasing again at a later stage (400 ms). The results thus suggest that perceptual acceleration occurs during temporal integration, but is nonlinear, such that some time that is gained at one moment in the process can be lost again at another.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Despite no direct foveal stimulation, we were able to decode peripheral saccade targets from foveal retinotopic areas, demonstrating that image-specific feedback during saccade preparation may underlie this effect. Decoding was sensitive to shape but not semantic category of natural images, indicating feedback of only low-to-mid-level information. Cross-decoding to a control condition with foveal stimulus presentation indicates a shared representational format between foveal feedback and direct stimulation. Moreover, eccentricity-dependent analyses showed a u-shaped decoding curve, confirming that these results are not explained by spillover of peripheral activity or large receptive fields. Finally, fluctuations in foveal decodability covaried with activity in the intraparietal sulcus, thus providing a candidate region for driving foveal feedback. These findings suggest that foveal cortex predicts the features of incoming stimuli through feedback from higher cortical areas, which offers a candidate mechanism underlying stable perception.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

This study investigated the effects of VR modality level of immersion, locomotion interface, and proprioception on spatial learning and physiological measures using eye-tracking (ET) in VR. We translated the classic T-maze task from Barnes et al. (1980) to humans for the first time, comparing three VR modalities: 3D HMD VR with physical walking, 3D HMD VR with controller-based movement, and 2D desktop VR. Results revealed that human participants employed a mixture of cue, place, and response strategies when navigating the virtual T-maze, mirroring rodent behavior. In both samples, no significant differences were found between the two HMD VR conditions in learning performance, nor consistent ones in strategy choices. However, 2D desktop navigation was associated with slower initial learning, though this discrepancy diminished in subsequent sessions. These results were supported by spatial presence, immersion, and naturalness reports. Gaze measures showed that participants who physically walked devoted more visual attention to environmental cues compared to controller users. Predictive models for identifying spatial learning strategies based on ET and behavioral measures demonstrated significant accuracy in some models, particularly in the VR walking condition and second session. Our findings enhance the understanding of spatial learning strategies and the effects of VR modality on cognition and gaze behavior. This work demonstrates the potential of integrated ET data and holds implications for early detection and personalized rehabilitation of neurodegenerative conditions related to spatial cognition.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

These disorders are caused by biallelic mutaAons in one of over 40 genes regulating the function of the primary cilium, a near-ubiquitous antenna-like organelle involved in signal reception and transduction. To date, the pathogenetic mechanisms linking ciliary gene dysfunction to Joubert syndrome neurodevelopmental defects are poorly understood. In this study, we generate cerebellar organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells carrying either null mutaAons or paAent-derived variants in RPGRIP1L, a Joubert syndrome causal gene encoding a scaffold protein crucial for ciliary function. While control organoids robustly express markers of cerebellar glutamatergic and GABAergic lineages including Purkinje cells, RPGRIP1L-deficient organoids display a consistent and severe reduction in Purkinje cell markers, along with impaired neurogenesis and increased progenitor proliferaAon. These defects coincide with prolonged overactivation of the FGF signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FGF signaling rescues both the proliferative/neurogenic balance and Purkinje lineage formaAon in RPGRIP1L-deficient organoids. Thus, our findings uncover early FGF pathway deregulaAon as a key driver of cerebellar differentiation defects in an in vitro model of Joubert syndrome, providing new insight into the developmental origin of cerebellar impairment in neurodevelopmental ciliopathies", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The molecular mechanisms driving this shift remain largely unexplored. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility profiling (scATAC-Seq) across developmental retinal neurogenesis in the 13-lined ground squirrel (13LGS) to uncover the regulatory basis of this adaptation. We find that 13LGS cone photoreceptors arise not only from early-stage neurogenic progenitors, as seen in rod-dominant species like mice, but also from late-stage neurogenic progenitors. This extended period of cone generation is driven by a heterochronic shift in transcription factor expression, with cone-promoting factors such as Onecut2, Pou2f1, and Zic3 remaining active in late-stage progenitors, and factors that promote cone differentiation such as Thrb, Rxrg, and Mef2c expressed precociously in late-stage neurogenic progenitors. Functional analyses reveal that Zic3 and Mef2c are sufficient to promote cone photoreceptor and respress rod specification, and act through species-specific regulatory elements that drive their expression in late-stage progenitors. These results demonstrate that evolutionary modifications to gene regulatory networks underlie the development of cone-dominant retinas and provide insight into mechanisms of sensory adaptation and potential strategies for cone photoreceptor regeneration in vision disorders.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Here we extend an existing dynamical model of binocular rivalry to encompass two novel experimental paradigms: a threshold detection variant of binocular rivalry, and tracking continuous flash suppression. Together, these tasks provide complementary measures of the dynamics and magnitude of perceptual suppression. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a single mechanism, competitive (hysteretic) inhibition between slowly adapting monocular populations, can account for the suppression depth findings across both paradigms.

Currently, whether quantifying stomatal density to a moderately high level via genetical manipulation could improve Arabidopsis biomass remains unknown. The Arabidopsis transgenic lines with increased stomatal density were acquired through overexpressing a gene (the homologs of STOMAGEN, FSTOMAGEN, the homologs in Flaveria). The biomass of Arabidopsis transgenic lines with intermediate stomatal density increased. Compared with the other lines, the biomass of the transgenic lines with excessive stomatal density exhibited no difference or decrease. There was a positive and significant correlation between biomass and relative water content. During the earlier phase of growth, the leaf growth rate and leaf area of the lines with higher stomatal density was faster and larger respectively, and there was a significant linear relationship between stomatal density and leaf growth rate and a strong linear relationship between stomatal density and leaf area, which was in agreement with the notion that more stomata indicated faster CO2 assimilation and then faster accumulation of biomass, although it occurs in earlier phase. This suggested that the increased biomass was attributed to the earlier phase. Results indicated that finely tuning stomatal density could improve Arabidopsis biomass by genetically manipulating FSTOMAGEN. The functions of STOMAGEN homologs are extremely conserved in the evolution, thus it is promising that this genetically modified strategy could be applied in other species, which benefits the reduction of the concentration of atmosphere CO2 and the production.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Despite forays into the description and quantification of these punctuated events, the effects of such changes on subsequent cancer evolution remain incompletely understood. Here we investigate how non-gradual mutagenesis affects the ability of tumor cells to acquire and retain fitness-enhancing adaptations. We find that punctuated mutagenesis significantly facilitates adaptation in scenarios where adaptation requires crossing a fitness valley, i.e. when multiple mutations are required which individually are maladaptive but jointly confer a fitness advantage. By increasing the probability that multiple mutations occur in close succession, punctuation increases the chance that mutants in a fitness valley mutate further to reach a fitness peak before going extinct. Analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we find that tumors with signatures of APOBEC mutagenesis, which has been shown to proceed in episodic bursts, exhibit patterns consistent with higher rates of crossing fitness valleys. Lastly, we characterize how the interplay between this enhanced ability to cross fitness valleys and adaptation-limiting effects of clonal interference affects overall adaptability in complex fitness landscapes.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

To test how descending vertical supports of varying diameters affects locomotor abilities, we quantified postural and kinematic features during descents and ascents on vertical supports in 21 eutherian and metatherian mammals, and examined their relation to morphology. Primates showed greater variability in descent behaviors, using tail-first and side postures more often than other mammals, which predominantly descended head-first. Overall, animals adopted several kinematic adjustments to enhance stability during descent compared to ascent, including slower speeds, higher duty factors, and greater use of asymmetrical gaits. Additionally, vertical descent strategies reflected trade-offs among body mass, limb proportions, and head mass. Using a morphology-based model, we then inferred possible descent behaviors in 13 extinct euarchontoglires.

Extant grasses exhibit a particularly interesting set of duplications and losses of SPCH. Using phylogenetic methods, we tracked the history of SPCH duplications. Brachypodium distachyon and Oryza sativa plants bearing mutations in either SPCH1 or SPCH2, and B. distachyon plants with SPCH1 or SPCH2 translational reporters were assayed under different environmental conditions for their effects on stomatal development. We identified the Poaceae-specific rho whole genome duplication as the origin of SPCH1 and SPCH2 and demonstrated that both paralogs remain under selection. We found paralog-specific divergence in response to two environmental perturbations in both B. distachyon and O. sativa. Plausible molecular mechanisms underpinning paralog divergence, and cellular mechanisms driving the stomatal phenotypes are supported by analyses of BdSPCH1 and BdSPCH2 RNA and protein expression and by sequence variation among grasses.

Predictive processes in cognition and the brain are usually modelled as tracking objective event probabilities, deriving predictions and prediction errors from the statistical structure of the environment. However, our subjective models of our environments do not always align with these objective statistics. Currently we know little about how these subjective representations may determine the predictive functions. To separate subjective and objective contributions to prediction, we conducted three studies where cues (actions or tones) predicted visual outcomes (shapes or Gabors) with varying contingencies, and adult participants discriminated these outcomes. Uniquely to our paradigm, participants also reported their experiences of the statistical structure embedded in the task - the subjective probability (Experiment 1; N = 68), expectedness (Experiment 2; N = 35), or surprise (Experiment 3; N = 35) associated with the outcomes. When modelling subjective ratings alongside objective structure, the speed of perceptual decisions was best explained by independent, additive contributions of both. The decision itself was usually only explained by the subjective ratings, with little additional variance explained by objective statistical structure. These findings suggest that subjective experience may play a key, overlooked role in predictive processes, and open a host of interesting questions about the relative objective and subjective contributions to prediction, perception, and learning.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Our modeling results demonstrate that CISH knockout increases the transcription of activation biomarkers IL-2 and TNF-a, but also inhibitory biomarkers such PD1 and FasL. Using global sensitivity analysis, we also found that GSK3B, which is responsible for the deactivation of the NFAT, is also predicted to further increase T cell activation when knocked out.

Both WT and Fmr1 rat pairs exhibited dynamic turn-taking with mixed leader-follower behavior for cooperation; however, WT pairs achieved significantly greater cooperation success than Fmr1 pairs. WT and Fmr1 pairs both successfully utilized a simple follower-tracking-leader reactive strategy, dependent on partner-directed visual attention, resulting in slower asynchronous transitions, with Fmr1 pairs more reliant on this strategy. WT rat pairs in addition exhibited a more efficient, flexible predictive cooperation strategy, dependent on coordination of optimal transition patterns between rat pairs and recent partner choice history, resulting in faster synchronous transitions. Fmr1 rats were unable to show adaptation to the probabilistic reward condition by employing this more efficient social reciprocity strategy of higher complexity, leading to deficits in cooperative behavior.

In eukaryotes, lipid droplets (LDs) serve as dynamic organelles that store neutral lipids (NLs), buffer lipotoxic stress, and regulate signaling pathways, with their biogenesis controlled by diacylglycerol o-acyltransferases (DGATs). Although P. falciparum encodes a putative DGAT (PF3D7_0322300), its role in the parasite life cycle has not been elucidated. We generated conditional PfDGAT-knockout parasites to investigate the enzyme's functional significance. PfDGAT deficiency led to parasite death, accompanied by reduced LD formation, elevated phospholipid levels, and induction of ER stress. Moreover, PfDGAT deletion altered protein trafficking, resulting in the decreased cytoadherence of parasite-infected erythrocytes to human brain microvascular endothelial cells, and suppressed parasite sexual differentiation. Thus, PfDGAT deletion affected multiple aspects of the parasite's life cycle, highlighting its critical role in parasite survival and pathogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into parasite lipid homeostasis and highlight DGAT as a potential target of antimalarial intervention.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

First, we identified an immunometabolic axis characterised by microglial activation, suppression of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling and epigenetic signatures that suggest repurposing of developmental transcription factors such as BARHL1. Second, we decomposed the effect of sex into a multi-omic program linked to cellular plasticity: although driven by canonical sex-chromosome genes, this axis was epigenetically enriched for pathways regulating stem-cell pluripotency and exhibited a female-biased shift toward precursor-like states in the oligodendrocyte lineage.

A detailed study of the the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Makorin 2 (MKRN2) demonstrated that it is localized to SGs in a manner dependent on active ubiquitination. MKRN2 promotes both the proper formation of SGs and their disassembly following stress recovery, by preventing the accumulation of defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) within SGs. Therefore, MKRN2 is a novel regulator of SGs that mediates the maintenance of granulostasis, suggesting that the localization of a subset of E3 ligases into SGs is linked to their capacity to ubiquitinate target proteins.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

In 2014, missense mutations in the gene encoding elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4) were identified as the causative gene for SCA34. ELOVL4, which is involved in the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, ELOVL4 is highly expressed in the cerebellum compared to other brain regions, with predominant expression in neurons. We attempted to establish a mouse model of SCA34 by expressing mutant ELOVL4 in cerebellar neurons using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and to elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Expression of W246G mutant ELOVL4 successfully induced progressive motor dysfunction beginning at two weeks post-AAV vector injection. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells and neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) paralleled the observed motor decline. Importantly, microglial activation was detected in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortices and the DCN prior to the onset of both neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction. Furthermore, after the onset of motor symptoms, the SCA34 model mice exhibited decreased synaptic inputs from climbing fibers to Purkinje cells, as well as reduce inputs from Purkinje cells to DCN neurons. These findings suggest that early microglial activation and the resulting synaptic disturbance are critical preceding events that lead to the progressive cerebellar neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction observed in this SCA34 mouse model.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

However, their intricate behavior, such as frequent exchange with bulk solvent or persistent stabilization in the binding site, makes the accurate binding free-energy estimation via molecular dynamics-based approaches challenging. Particularly, inadequate sampling of water reorganization might not only bias computed affinities but also obscure key interactions, making adequate rehydration of the binding site violated upon calculations. To address this, we employ the polarizable AMOEBA force field together with Lambda-ABF-OPES, an integrated enhanced-sampling framework, which combines lambda-dynamics, multiple-walker adaptive biasing force, and exploratory version of on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling technique that enables efficient rehydration sampling of the binding site without explicitly including any water-related collective variable. Such strategy ensures robust sampling of water exchange and reorganization, enabling reliable rehydration of the binding pose throughout the calculation. Applied to five water-containing protein-ligand complexes with diverse ligand types and binding-site environments, the approach yields binding affinities efficiently and in good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating that Lambda-ABF-OPES captures dynamic water networks and provides robust and reproducible absolute binding free-energy estimation towards chemical accuracy.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we systematically mapped the sequence-function landscape of the BDC using tiled base editor screens across four endogenous components--CTNNB1, AXIN1, APC, and GSK3B. Validation studies identified ~150 previously unreported mutations across these genes that affected WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling. In addition to known cancer-associated mutations, we discovered rare gain-of-function and separation-of-function alleles of AXIN1 and CTNNB1 that provide mechanistic insights into complex assembly and regulation.

Here, we introduce a Non-invasive Electrophysiological Recording and Ultrasound Neuromodulation Sleep Patch (NEUSLeeP) in delivering focused ultrasound stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) overnight with simultaneous stable polysomnography recording. Our sleep patch integrates a custom eight-channel concentric ring transducer array with real-time electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG) recording, and individualized line-of-sight targeting to sonicate deep brain areas while preserving mobility. Our platform operated safely and comfortably across the two-nights sleep study. Stimulation of the left STN was delivered every 90 minutes throughout the night and was associated with a 25% increase in REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep duration and a 43 minutes reduction in REM sleep latency compared to a sham night in a study of 26 subjects. Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal attenuation in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was localized primarily to a left ipsilateral basal-ganglia-midbrain-temporal circuit, consistent with selective network modulation rather than global arousal changes.

Yet, three key questions remain unanswered: (1) How do representations of contextual associations relate to perceptual and categorical representation in visual cortex, (2) how do they emerge across time, and (3) how are they mechanistically implemented? To answer these questions, we recorded fMRI and EEG while participants (human, both sexes) viewed isolated objects stemming from two scene contexts. Multivariate pattern analysis on the neural data revealed that objects from the same context were coded more similarly than objects from different contexts in object-selective LOC and scene-selective PPA, even when systematically controlling for perceptual and categorical similarities. Such contextual relation representations emerged relatively late during visual processing (i.e., after perceptual and categorical representations), specifically in the anterior PPA, and likely through a mixture of object-to-object and object-to-scene associations.

However, the consequences of these secondary extinctions for ecosystem services are not known. Here we address this gap by coupling threats to species and their interaction networks, and these networks to ecosystem service provisioning. We use a highly resolved food web dataset of the Barents Sea, and simulate secondary extinctions using Bayesian networks. We explore a range of assumptions on how the loss of service-providing species translates to the disintegration of the services they provide. We find that activation of threats cause secondary extinctions of service-providing as well as supporting species which negatively affect ecosystem services, and that the magnitude of these effects are highly dependent on the sensitivity of consumers to resource loss as well as service robustness. We also show that the indirect effects from species interactions causes substantial decreases in service provisioning. Understanding the linkages between ecological threats, species interactions in ecological networks and ecosystem service provisioning will be an important tool for guiding management strategies for effective ecosystem service management.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

We recorded sequences of individual birds moving just over the ground in a ~20 m wide corridor along the edge of the St. Lawrence estuary.

Birds were much more likely to be following conspecifics at close range than other species, as evidenced by randomization tests, after accounting for species composition and abundance during each specific migration event. Conspecific sequences were mostly of two individuals, but much larger sequences occurred, up to 103 consecutive individuals of the same species.

Although most studies focus on development, LIS1 is also expressed in adult mouse tissues. We previously in-duced LIS1 knockout (iKO) in adult mice using a Cre-Lox approach with an actin promoter driving CreERT2 ex-pression. This proved to be rapidly lethal, but death occurred before tamoxifen-induced CreERT2 activity be-came widespread. The heart showed the highest level of CreERT2 activity, but heart-specific LIS1 depletion did not affect survival, ruling out a cardiac-based etiology. CreERT2 activity was observed in many astrocytes and some neurons in the brain suggesting that the defect could be related to defective cardiorespiratory circuits. We now report that LIS1 depletion from astrocytes is not lethal to mice although glial fibrillary protein (GFAP) expression is increased in LIS1 depleted astrocytes. In contrast, LIS1 depletion from projection neurons causes motor deficits and rapid lethality. This is accompanied by progressive, widespread axonal degeneration along the entire length of both motor and sensory axons. Interestingly, sensory neurons harvested from iKO mice ini-tially extend axons in culture but soon develop axonal swellings and fragmentation, indicating axonal degenera-tion. LIS1 is a prominent regulator of cytoplasmic dynein 1, a microtubule motor whose disruption can cause both cortical malformations and later-onset neurodegenerative disease.

This process, known as pattern separation, is a key computational feature at this synapse. However, such sparse activity and connectivity increase the risk of information loss, as multiple presynaptic inputs are typically required to elicit a postsynaptic action potential. Interestingly, MF synapses exhibit robust short-term plasticity (STP), enabling a dynamic increase in release probability during brief bursts of presynaptic activity. This mechanism ensures that a short, high-frequency burst from a single granule cell can reliably generate a spike in its postsynaptic CA3 target. Unlike other hippocampal synapses, MF boutons are large, with multiple active zones, each coupled to a cluster of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs). MF boutons also possess a large readily releasable pool of vesicles. The functional consequences of this unusual synaptic design remain largely unexplored. In fact, the MF synapse is often depicted as a synapse with multiple sites, each behaving as an independent transmission line, analogous to several CA3 boutons contacting a single CA1 dendrite. We developed a physiologically realistic spatial model of the MF bouton to investigate how its peculiar structural and functional properties affect synaptic signaling and plasticity. Contrary to earlier assumptions, our computational model revealed, release sites are not independent transmission units. Crosstalk between calcium domains is necessary for the observed strong STP and for the timely activation of CA3 neurons. VDCCs in the MF bouton are only loosely coupled to active zones, and the distance between active zones is relatively large. In addition to the synaptic design and the known role of calbindin-D28k and synaptotagmin-7 in STP, we find that loose coupling of VDCCs to active zones and large inter-AZ distances are crucial. These features keep the basal release probability low, and their combined action is required to generate the facilitation that triggers postsynaptic action potentials in response to bursts filtering out non-informative dentate activity, and provides a strong rationale for the mossy fiber's synaptic architecture.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Nonlinear, bundle-specific trajectories captured multiphasic maturation, with subplate dynamics preceding increases in axonal coherence and early myelination. By filling a missing link in lifespan brain connectivity, this study establishes a prenatal reference for cortical wiring and provides tools for investigating the origins of neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Leveraging the high spatiotemporal fidelity of intracranial recordings in humans (N = 30), we provide evidence that mental sound manipulation involves the inhibition of sensory cortex and the coordinated engagement of memory and control networks. This modulation manifests in two ways. First, there is a shift in the balance between faster (> 30 Hz) and slower (< 30 Hz) dynamics in primary and secondary auditory areas, suggesting a decrease in local excitability. Second, there is a distributed increase in oscillatory synchrony (6-10 Hz), which predicts imagery vividness and task performance. This evidence points to a key role of local excitability and inter-areal synchrony in the manipulation of thought.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Further, questions remain about whether ocular tracking is modulated by speech intelligibility and which brain regions drive these synchronized eye movements. Here, we investigate ocular speech tracking in blindfolded early blind, late blind, and sighted individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and source-reconstructed oculomotor signals while participants listened to narrative speech of varying intelligibility. We found that oculomotor activity tracks acoustic speech features and, unlike neural speech tracking, is not modulated by intelligibility. Interestingly, we found effects reflected in two frequency-specific components: a low-frequency (~1 Hz) effect present across all groups, indicating that visual experience is not required, and a high-frequency (~6 Hz) effect reduced in early- and late-blind individuals. Moreover, this finding is not driven by cerebro-ocular connectivity, as late-blind individuals exhibit stronger connectivity between the eyes and the left temporal cortices without a corresponding increase in ocular tracking. In conclusion, ocular speech tracking seems to respond selectively to acoustic but not to intelligibility features of speech, and it does not require visual experience to develop. It may thus represent a hard-wired oculomotor mechanism within the oculo-cerebral network involved in speech processing.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Dendrites in single LINs showed consistent global responses to full-screen stimuli but varied responses to local stimuli. Dendrites from the same LIN exhibited different receptive fields that followed retinotopic progression. The similarity between dendritic and somatic responses decreased with increasing distance. Weak local stimuli could excite dendrites locally, while salient local stimuli triggered global responses. Salient global stimuli further enhanced motion selectivity, preference consistency, and peak responses.

Participants judged a semantic relation between two words (synonym, antonym, thematically-related, taxonomically-related, or unrelated) sequentially presented. Brain rhythms (8-30 Hz) over the left language region, especially the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), were accelerated when a word pair with a high conceptual similarity (e.g. synonym) was presented. Importantly, this change in brain rhythm reflected an inter-word closeness as concepts (holistic similarity, typically seen in synonyms or thematically-related pairs), rather than an inter-word overlap of semantic features (partial similarity, typically seen in antonyms or taxonomically-related pairs).

Despite advances in our understanding of neurotransmission, a paradox remains about how the large number of active zones (AZs) that contribute to release have such a low variance, resulting in a tight binomial distribution. Muscle-specific sodium channel-blocking neurotoxins have allowed us to examine the release characteristics when the unit size of transmitter release (quantal size) is not altered. Our present study has compared the neurotransmitter release characteristics when D-tubocurarine (curare) or the Na-channel blocking conotoxin (-conotoxin GIIIB) was used as the extracellular calcium concentration was increased. Quantal neurotransmitter release from toad iliofibularis motor nerve terminals was examined using intracellular electrodes and focal extracellular electrodes. Motor nerve terminal branches for recordings were located using DiOC2(5)-fluorescent imaging. Muscle action potentials were suppressed by using -conotoxin GIIIB (-CgTx GIIIB, 2.0 x 10-6 M) or curare, 6.5 x 10-6 M. Under -CgTx GIIIB, the maximum transmitter release reached was 25 quanta at high extracellular calcium concentration (2.1 mM); conversely, under curare, quantal content reached 148 quanta (P=0.0067). Using binomial analysis, it was found that this quantal increase was due to a significant increase in the number of release sites 'n' rather than the average probability of release 'p'. Based on these observations, along with analyses of ECP shape and duration, we propose a mechanism in which a fast autoinhibitory response (< 5 ms from the nerve terminal impulse) limits the maximum level of depolarisation by voltage-dependent regulation of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel conductance.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Music is often used to modulate arousal and mood while individuals focus on other tasks, suggesting that sophisticated musical prediction may be implicit and obligatory, operating regardless of attention. Here we investigated the role of attention in musical prediction by presenting participants simultaneously with a musical passage in one ear and an audiobook in the other. Participants were asked to attend to either speech or music to perform a recognition memory task. Musical prediction was investigated using a computational model of music which was trained on a corpus of Western music (long-term learning) and/or incrementally on each stimulus (short-term learning). While neural tracking of the acoustics of music, including encoding of note onset and pitch interval size, was enhanced by attention, musical prediction tracked the neural signal robustly regardless of attention. However, although neural tracking of long-term musical prediction based on previously-learned statistical patterns was unaffected by attention, tracking of short-term musical prediction learned from the structure of each stimulus was present only when the music was attended. Thus, attention is crucial for short-term musical learning and prediction but is not required for musical prediction based on long-term stylistic exposure.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

In the absence of functional data for ancestral species, studies often rely on structural features such as cortical volume or surface area. However, atlas-based metrics derived from human or a few model organisms lack biological interpretability across species with divergent cortical architectures. Here, we investigate sulcal pits-the locally deepest points of cortical folds-as conserved, atlas-independent landmarks that provide a robust basis for cross-species comparison. Using cortical surface reconstructions from 90 mammalian species, we show that sulcal pit distribution patterns partly recapitulate phylogenetic relationships, independent of overall brain size (volume and surface area), and vary systematically with ecology and lifestyle. By tracing pit-based evolutionary trajectories from 80 million years ago to the present, we found pronounced differences across ecological and behavioral categories, indicating that cortical folding has diversified in close association with species' habitats, lifestyles, and social structures. Using sulcal pits, we identified Homo sapiens-specific regions and species-shared regions. The Homo-specific areas were functionally associated with higher cognitive and emotional processes, distinguished by unique histological features, enriched for gene sets related to neural regulation, and exhibited markedly different cell-type abundance profiles compared to shared regions.

We introduce a framework for evaluating benchmark metric calibration using positive and negative controls, including a new positive control baseline (the interpolated duplicate) and a quantitative calibration measure (the dynamic range fraction). Across 14 perturbation datasets and 13 evaluation metrics, we find that conventional metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and control-referenced delta correlation (Pearson({triangleup}ctrl)) are often poorly calibrated, whereas weighted and rank-based alternatives exhibit consistent calibration. Under well-calibrated metrics, deep learning models outperform mean, control, and linear baselines, and in some cases even surpass the additive baseline in combination-prediction tasks. Calibrated evaluation thus explains prior reports of model underperformance, revealing that deep learning models do outperform uninformative baselines.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

However, the reproducibility of ML applications in neuroimaging remains limited, challenging the generalizability of inferences to broader populations. In addition to the inherent variability of the brain activity (both in healthy and pathological states), poor reproducibility is further enhanced by inconsistencies in data preprocessing techniques and methods for calculating functional connectivity (FC), which are used as parameters for brain state classification. To systematically assess the impact of abovementioned factors on ML applications to fMRI data, we benchmarked a comprehensive set of FC analysis pipelines for the classification task between fMRI data recorded in two fundamentally different states: eyes open and eyes closed. In contrast to studies involving heterogeneous clinical populations or using complex cognitive tasks, our controlled experimental design - based on two independent datasets of healthy participants collected in different laboratories - minimizes variability related to a task design or pathological brain states. Classification accuracy and reproducibility were compared for 192 distinct FC analysis pipelines, covering common preprocessing approaches, brain parcellation schemes, and connectivity metrics. Notably, we employed a cross-site validation strategy, training predictive models on data from one site and testing them on the other. Despite the substantial variability in pipeline configurations, we observed consistently high classification accuracy (~80%), confirming that FC-based models can robustly discriminate between well-defined brain states (eye conditions) across different acquisition sites. Best results both in terms of classification accuracy and stability were observed using Pearson correlation and tangent correlation as FC, Brainnetome as atlas, and confound regression strategies based on the CompCor method.

Methods: We applied a modified version of the Koizumi method to directly visualize the internal carotid artery (ICA) PPA bifurcation and systematically compare targeted ICA versus PPA occlusion. We combined multiple complementary methods - survival studies, neurological scoring, 2,3,5 Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) infarct staining, Evans blue blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability assays, laser speckle cerebral blood flow imaging, small-animal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and evaluation of inflammatory gene expression through qPCR to rigorously characterize injury patterns, survival, and inflammatory responses. Results: ICA occlusion approximately caused a rapid 70% reduction in cerebral blood flow, progressive infarction (15 min: smaller infarct with approximately 50% 7-day survival; 30 min: moderate infarct but >50% mortality), and cortical edema. In contrast, PPA occlusion produced only a gradual 44% decline in blood flow, small infarcts at 60 min) and preserved survival (80% at 7 days). Finally, magnetic resonance imaging in 15-minute ICA occluded mice identified the development of cortical edema which was not observed in sham, 15-minute PPA, or 60-minute PPA mice. Conclusion: These findings identify 15-minute ICA occlusion as the most practical balance between reproducible infarction and survival for long-term studies, while 30 minutes is best reserved for short-term infarct induction when survival is less critical.

However, these studies may have overlooked subtle spatial and temporal dynamics, which could influence how explicit aiming and implicit recalibration interact. Recent research shows that implicit recalibration anchors to where a person aims their movements, with aiming strategies directly shaping their spatial development. Moreover, implicit recalibration operates across multiple timescales, with both temporally volatile and persistent components. To examine whether these factors mask the true relationship between explicit strategies and implicit recalibration, we conducted a visuomotor rotation task while carefully accounting for the interplay of spatial and temporal dynamics. After controlling for spatial dynamics (plan-based generalization) and temporal dynamics (forgetting), we found a strong relationship between explicit strategies and implicit recalibration. Despite finding this strong relationship, it appears to be sub-additive, which may result from simple methodological imprecision, the operation of additional but unobserved processes, or more complex nonlinear interactions between processes.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Methods: Using a defined self-assembling peptide, we established a robust and reproducible method to generate hepatic organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), termed hepatic organobodies (OBs), which remained stable in culture for several weeks. The hepatic identity and maturation of OBs were characterized by qPCR, histology, immunofluorescence, and bulk RNA sequencing. Their functional competence was evaluated by ELISA, CYP3A4 induction assays, and assessment of drug biotransformation capacity using HPLC-MS/MS, in parallel with three-dimensional human primary hepatocyte (3D PHH) cultures. Finally, the model was applied to predict the hepatotoxicity of a selected panel of known compounds and benchmarked against HepG2 cells and 3D PHH microtissues. Results: hiPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) cultured in OBs acquired characteristic hepatic morphology and expressed several key hepatocyte-specific genes, some at levels comparable to those in freshly isolated primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). OBs secreted significantly higher amounts of albumin and 1-antitrypsin (A1AT) compared with parallel 2D-cultured HLCs. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed higher relative expression of major drug metabolism genes, including CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2, as well as enhanced maturation, evidenced by upregulation of the PPAR signalling and fatty acid {beta}-oxidation pathways in OBs relative to 2D HLCs.

CSS mammalian specifically by cancer cell lines but not nontumor cell lines and the CSS exerted cytocidality against other cell lines and vice versa regardless of species in mammalian. In vivo, CSS showed a significant life-prolonging effect without any adverse event. An established cell line derived from human renal cell carcinoma (HRC23) was used in this study as CSS was found and characterized by this cell line first.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

We aimed to determine whether multi-contact cuff electrodes can selectively recruit motor fibers of the pudendal nerve trunk in preclinical feline and ovine models. Methods: Multi-contact cuff electrodes were implanted around the pudendal nerve in anesthetized felines and ovines. Structured variations in electrode contact configurations and stimulation amplitudes were applied to evoke external urethral sphincter (EUS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) pressure responses. We calculated selectivity indices, EUS Scores, and EAS Scores to quantify selective recruitment and the magnitude of evoked pressure changes. Results: We achieved selective motor activation, with preferential recruitment of the EUS or EAS in all three feline experiments and one of three ovine experiments. In felines, at least four electrode combinations selectively evoked EUS responses (EUS Score 0.5) and at least one combination targeted the EAS. In ovines, one EUS-selective and six EAS-selective combinations obtained comparable scores. In preliminary tests, we observed functional increases in leak point pressure and incontinence prevention with selective stimulation. Conclusions: This study shows that multi-contact cuff electrodes can selectively activate EUS and EAS motor fibers in the pudendal nerve. Future work should focus on optimizing stimulation parameters to enhance selectivity and assess the translational potential of this approach for restoring pelvic organ control.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

In melanocytes, pigmentation is often associated with differentiation, yet mature melanocytes vary in pigment content. In melanoma, pigmentation-linked transcriptional programs may have prognostic value, but visual assessments of tumor pigmentation have yielded inconsistent results. Progress linking pigmentation phenotypes to cell state has been limited by a lack of tools that can directly and dynamically quantify melanin content in live cells. Here we present QUantitative Imaging of Label-free Pigment-associated ENtities (QUILPEN), a label-free multi-modal imaging technique that combines quantitative phase imaging (QPI), quadrant darkfield (QDF), and absorption imaging, to independently capture light that has been transmitted, scattered, and absorbed. This non-destructive method enables live-cell imaging over multiple days without labels. We show absorption as a reliable readout of melanin content, which can be decoupled from melanosome content detected by QDF, which measures scattered light. Applying QUILPEN to melanoma cells before and during repigmentation, we find that melanin content is highly heterogeneous, and that this heterogeneity is reinstated upon repigmentation. Lineage tracking further reveals that melanin synthesis rates are heritable and can be transmitted both symmetrically and asymmetrically. QUILPEN enables real-time quantification of pigmentation dynamics and cell-level heterogeneity.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The nucleus pulposus (NP) of the IVD is usually degenerated first in age-related IDD. Addressing NP degeneration remains challenging due to insufficient understanding of its etiologies. Here, we characterize zebrafish IVD, particularly the NP, and note several characteristics that are common to or different from those of mammals. The adult zebrafish NP can be partitioned into three sections: the NP envelope with a monolayer of basal cells, the peripheral region with clustered vacuolated and non-vacuolated NP cells, and the central fibrotic region with low cellularity. With age, the percentage of vacuolated NP cells decreases, whereas that of non-vacuolated NP cells increases, as in mammals. However, a cluster of vacuolated cells persists in the NP periphery even in aged zebrafish. Notably, the ratio of the span of the fibrotic NP center to NP diameter remains largely constant at 50% regardless of age, suggesting that the zebrafish NP can better maintain its overall shape and structure, compared to mammalian NP. The fibrotic NP center and cell-populated NP periphery serve as internal controls to each other for studying NP maintenance and fibrosis. With external development, high fecundity, and great regenerative capabilities, zebrafish may be a unique NP model to complement mammalian models for studying how the NP degenerates and how the dormant capability of NP regeneration may be revitalized in humans.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The ICM proposes that serially developing features, such as molar teeth, is governed by the relative magnitudes of one activating and one inhibiting developmental process. The statistical expectations of the ICM are typically expressed and analyzed on a first-element standardized scale and seem to be a good predictor of molar proportions. However, the ICM has been applied to traits that occur in series but do not develop in sequence and still recovers as good a fit as when applied to serially developing traits. Such an undiscriminating result raises questions about whether the fit of the ICM is an artifact of standardization. The mathematical rendition of the ICM do not correspond with the verbal descriptions of the developmental argument. Applying our novel re-articluation of the ICM to biological, non-biological, and simulated data, we demonstrate that the apparent goodness of fit of the ICM to many biological systems is an artifact of scaling correlated values with a common denominator. There is little evidence supporting the ICM at the developmental, variational, or evolutionary levels.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

This includes insults to the material structure and mechanosensitivity of the vessel. This framework successfully simulates clinically-relevant phenotypes, including cases where lesions with initially similar degrees of dilatation or rates of expansion diverge in behavior later in their progression.

We quantified the contribution of brain state, sleep-pressure dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle, and circadian rhythmicity to electroencephalographic (EEG) functional connectivity (FC) and examined how these network changes relate to cognition. Thirty-four healthy adults completed a 10-day forced-desynchrony protocol to uncouple sleep-wake and endogenous circadian rhythms. From over 1,200 hours of artifact-free EEG, we derived phase-coupling metrics to quantify FC across brain states, thirds-of-the-night (sleep pressure), and circadian phase, and related these network measures to a range of cognitive performance indices. FC differed markedly between brain states, especially in the alpha and sigma bands, and was modulated by sleep history and circadian phase. Principal component analysis revealed both a global and a topographically distributed FC component which responded differentially to sleep pressure. Dissipation of sleep pressure was accompanied by increasing global FC in NREM sleep, and especially in the delta, sigma and beta frequencies, and decreasing global FC in the alpha band. During REM sleep, global FC decreased in nearly all frequency bands with dissipation of sleep pressure. The influence of circadian phase on FC was smaller than that of sleep pressure and varied across brain states. Lower global theta-band FC in NREM and alpha-band FC during wake predicted better alertness and working memory accuracy, an effect modulated by circadian phase. These results suggest that sleep homeostasis and circadian timing interact to stabilize functional brain connectivity in wakefulness, thereby supporting optimal cognitive function.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a systematic review and trait-based meta-analysis of 387 microbial taxa spanning 314 studies and 76 years of research, integrating phenotypic, genomic, and environmental data to define ecologically coherent MIRC guilds. Rather than relying on taxonomy, our framework delineates first-order functional guilds - Fe(III)-reducers, Fe(II)-oxidizers, and dual-capacity Fe oxidizers/reducers - and resolves second-order guilds based on trait syndromes such as acidophily, redox flexibility, or metabolic breadth. Trait profiling revealed that iron-cycling capacities frequently transcend phylogenetic boundaries, with multiple guilds converging in chemically stratified hotspots like hot springs, hydrothermal vents, and acid mine drainages. Dual-capacity Fe oxidizers/reducers (e.g., Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Metallosphaera sedula) emerged as overlooked mediators of \"cryptic\" iron cycling, possessing genomic repertoires capable of toggling between oxidative and reductive modes in response to redox oscillations. Hierarchical clustering and kernel density analyses of ecophysiological traits highlighted niche partitioning along key environmental filters, including pH, iron availability, salinity, and temperature.

We determined protein copy numbers for ~4,500 proteins, including 99 peroxisomal and peroxisome-associated proteins. Our data reveal that the peroxisomal proteome is ~3-fold higher abundant in oleate-grown cells, constituting 2.8% of the total proteome (corresponding to 2.01 x 106 protein copies) compared to 0.8% (6.67 x 105 protein copies) in glucose, reflecting the necessity for peroxisomal functions such as fatty acid beta-oxidation.

There is a poor understanding of the critical quality attributes correlating to therapeutic efficacy of hMSCs. To address this challenge, we analyzed pre-clinical in vitro secretome profiles and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of hMSCs from multiple human donors. hMSCs from different donors showed significant differences between donors in therapeutic efficacy when assessed in a rat post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) model. A partial least squares feature learning model was trained to evaluate differences between more and less therapeutic donor hMSCs by examining cytokine secretion profiles, to predict donor-specific therapeutic outcomes. More therapeutic hMSCs exhibited increased secretion of GM-CSF, GRO, IL-4, and PDGF-AA, whereas less therapeutic donors had higher TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1 secretion. The cytokine profile was accompanied by evaluation of MAPK pathway, which revealed distinct differences in phospho-protein signaling between more and less therapeutic hMSC secretome profiles. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK signaling in more therapeutic donor cells decreased hMSC secretion of the key therapeutic associated cytokines and shifted hMSC secretome towards a less therapeutic profile. Prospective validation of cells from additional donors demonstrated significant correlations between predicted and observed pre-clinical in vivo efficacy to attenuate OA.

Defects in long-range cell-cell alignment, or nematic orientation, can act to localize morphogenetic events in a tissue. Although these two cues have been considered in isolation, we demonstrate a relationship in epithelial tissue between long-range calcium signaling and the cell's nematic order: The speed of a wound-induced calcium wave depends monotonically on the angle between the wave vector and cell axis, with maximal wave speed occurring perpendicular to the tissue's orientation. Including anisotropic diffusive coupling between cells in a canonical reaction-diffusion model recapitulates our measured calcium wave dynamics.

Functionally, DEL-C1 reversed CHI3L1-induced astrocyte dysfunction by restoring A{beta} uptake, lysosomal acidification, and proteolytic activity, while reducing CHI3L1 and IL-6 secretion. DEL-C1 also suppressed CHI3L1-driven NF-{kappa}B transcriptional activation, highlighting its anti-inflammatory potential. Collectively, this study establishes DEL-C1 as a promising small molecule modulator of CHI3L1 and a chemical tool to interrogate astrocyte-driven neuroinflammation in AD.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Through cancer-induced systemic conditioning, breast tumours generate subclinical alterations in distant organs that facilitate metastatic seeding and pre-metastatic niche formation. Neutrophils, mobilized through cancer-driven emergency granulopoiesis, actively contribute to this process. In this study we extend the concept of neutrophil-dependent conditioning beyond pre-metastatic sites, uncovering a broader systemic regenerative activation that links inflammation, tissue regeneration, and metastasis. This activation manifests as enhanced epithelial progenitor activity, measured by increased organoid formation, across multiple organs, including those with low risk of breast cancer metastasis. This neutrophil-dependent perturbation in lung alveolar progenitors and intestinal epithelial lineage commitment, is an indication of an altered organ physiology, enhancing tissue resilience to injury. Moreover, we identify UPP1 expression, which exclusively characterizes neutrophils generated through emergency granulopoiesis, as a key factor sustaining high translational activity in neutrophil progenitors and enabling the full acquisition of cancer-primed properties. Consequently, neutrophil loss of UPP1 reduces both their lung pro-metastatic function and their capacity to activate alveolar progenitors. Mechanistically, this involves interactions between cancer-primed neutrophils and platelets, which localize within lung interstitial spaces near alveolar cells to stimulate epithelial progenitor activity. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized tumour-induced systemic conditioning in which neutrophils coordinate epithelial regenerative activation as part of a pro-metastatic epithelial niche, with UPP1 as a key determinant of their cancer-primed state.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

N-terminal methionine amino peptidases (MetAP) are a class of enzymes that cleave the initiator methionine amino acids to allow for peptide maturation and co-translational processing. Specifically, based on its role in protein synthesis, MetAP2 has been found to be upregulated in cancer cells and has been explored as a potential anticancer target. Cellular perturbations that impinge on protein synthesis activate cellular stress pathways, including the integrated stress response and mTORC1. Nitroxoline, a MetAP2 inhibitor has been explored as an anticancer agent but is hampered by poor pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we synthesize a few O-substituted silyl and nonsilyl nitroxoline analogs to diversify the nitroxoline template to reduce metabolic vulnerability. In vitro MetAP2 and cancer cell proliferation inhibition assays demonstrate that synthesized analogs retain potency when compared to the parent nitroxoline. Mechanistically, we show that the lead candidate compound 3 and nitroxoline activate ATF4 mediated stress responses through non-canonical mTORC1.

Pharmacological strategies that enhance inhibitory tone, via inhibition of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT), the enzyme which degrades endogenous GABA, provides analgesic benefit in preclinical studies. (S)-MeCPP-115 is a novel selective GABA-AT inactivator designed from CPP-115 to minimize off-target activity. Whether (S)-MeCPP-115 shows efficacy in preclinical pain models is unknown. Methods: In vitro assays of cell viability were conducted to ascertain whether (S)-MeCPP-115 interfered with antitumor activity of paclitaxel or produced cytotoxicity in normal cells. Male mice received paclitaxel to induce chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in vivo. In mice with established paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, (S)-MeCPP-115 was administered via acute and chronic administration using intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intrathecal (i.t.) dosing strategies. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed in all mice with an electronic von Frey analgesiometer before and after paclitaxel and pharmacological treatments. Locomotor activity was also measured in the same subjects to assess possible motor impairment. Results: In MTT assays, (S)-MeCPP-115 did not alter the cytotoxic activity of paclitaxel in 4T1 breast cancer cells and did not produce cytotoxicity in non-tumor HEK293 cells. (S)-MeCPP-115 reduced paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity after i.p. and i.t. administration. Therapeutic efficacy was maintained with repeated dosing without development of tolerance. (S)-MeCPP-115 did not alter paw withdrawal thresholds in mice that received the Cremophor-based vehicle in lieu of paclitaxel following acute or chronic dosing. Systemic treatment with (S)-MeCPP-115 was well tolerated, whereas i.t. administration produced only minimal locomotor effects. Conclusion: (S)-MeCPP-115 did not interfere with the ability of paclitaxel to produce tumor cell cytotoxicity in vitro and did not produce cytotoxicity in non-tumor cells. Systemic and intrathecal administration of (S)-MeCPP-115 produced robust suppression of mechanical hypersensitivity in a mouse model of paclitaxel-induced CIPN without major adverse effects. Selective GABA-AT inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for suppressing paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.

We integrated high-throughput phenotyping with metabolomics and transcriptomics under standardized soil drying to investigate drought responses across nine climatically distinct provenances of the conifer Pinus nigra. We tested whether drought tolerance, measured as decline in maximum quantum yield of the photosystem II (Fv/Fm), varies among provenances, follows a climatic cline, and involves trade-off with growth. To identify the underlying molecular basis, we performed metabolomics and transcriptomics in four provenances representing contrasting drought tolerance. Drought tolerance varied significantly among provenances and was decoupled from growth, yet showed no differentiation along the climatic cline. Drought tolerant provenances differed from sensitive ones in both constitutive and drought-induced levels of flavonoid and diterpene metabolites. Transcriptomic profiles further highlighted provenance-specific differences in gene expression related to flavonoids.

To address these issues, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate how methodological factors influence A{beta}-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. We included 359 eligible studies encompassing 1,192 MTT-based comparisons of cell viability between A{beta}-treated and control SH-SY5Y cells. A three-level meta-analysis estimated mean cell viability after A{beta} exposure at 63% of control levels (95% CI [61.6; 64.3]), with very high heterogeneity (I2=99.6%). Meta-regression identified significant associations between increased toxicity and higher A{beta} concentrations, longer exposure durations, and the use of peptide preparations described as fibrils. Conversely, differentiation protocols, duration, and cell density did not significantly influence toxicity outcomes. Reporting quality was often poor, with frequent omissions regarding cell line origin, authentication, contamination testing, A{beta} preparation details and nature of the experimental unit. Overall, our findings show robust A{beta} toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, primarily driven by dose, exposure time, and A{beta} aggregation state, but not cell differentiation status.

AD knock-in mice expressing signaling-deficient p75NTR variants in astrocytes showed enhanced Abeta burden, brain histopathology and cognitive impairment, even when variants were introduced late in the disease process. Astrocytes expressing dysfunctional p75NTR variants showed impaired uptake of Abeta oligomers, and their conditioned medium enhanced Abeta production in AD neurons. p75NTR signaling negatively regulated astrocyte cholesterol biosynthesis and secretion, while cholesterol depletion restored Abeta uptake in mutant astrocytes and reduced Abeta production in AD neurons. In agreement with the role of astrocyte-derived cholesterol, statin treatment reverted the effects of astrocyte p75NTR mutants on AD neuropathology.

In rodents, chronic and acute ethanol increases amyloid-[beta] (A[beta]), however those studies have been limited to a single sex or brain region. Objective This study explored how adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE), alters A[beta] in multiple regions of the brain in female and male TgF344-AD rats as they age. Methods From P28-P58, female and male TgF344-AD rats were administered either water (CON) or 5.0 g/kg ethanol (AIE; 20% ethanol w/v) via intragastric gavage on a 2-day on/off cycle. In Experiment 1, A[beta] was measured in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), piriform cortex (PC), entorhinal cortex (EC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) in 6- and 10-month-old rats. In Experiment 2, in vivo microdialysis was used in 3-month-old female rats to measure how ethanol directly modulates A[beta]; levels in the dHPC. Results In the OFC, PC, EC, vHPC, and dHPC, A[beta]40 and A[beta]42 was higher in 6-month-old female TgF344-AD rats compared to males. However, at 10 months A[beta]40 and A[beta]42 levels were only elevated in the dHPC of AIE-treated females, compared to all other groups. An acute ethanol challenge at 3 months selectively evoked a sustained increase in ISF A[beta]40 levels in AIE-treated females. Conclusions In aged females, the dHPC is a region sensitive to ethanol-associated A[beta] pathology. This may be due to disruptions in A{beta} clearance in early life, which may have an additive effect on A[beta] aggregation over the lifespan.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanistic link between TDP-43 dysfunction and neurodegeneration is poorly understood and likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. A major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease is exposure to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we investigated the synergistic interplay between TDP-43 dysfunction and TBI in a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/ frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Methods: A model of TDP-43 dysfunction caused by a knock-in Q331K mutation in Tardbp was combined with a mild model of TBI. Control conditions included both WT mice and mice with sham surgery. Animals were evaluated for behavioral deficits at timepoints pre- and post-surgery. Additionally, post-mortem brain tissues were examined using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics together with histological and biochemical analyses. Results: Expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 in vivo caused deficits in multiple branches of the proteostasis network, including protein folding, protein synthesis, and protein turnover. Examples include mis-expression of chaperones and genes within the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway in mutant TDP-43 versus WT mice. Further, mutant TDP-43 expression correlated with reduced thermostability of proteins associated with the ribosome and the chaperonin containing TCP-1 complex. In response to TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibited significantly worse neurological outcomes relative to WT animals. Heightened neurological deficits in mutant TDP-43 mice following TBI coincided with a robust upregulation of proteostasis- and stress-related genes at the transcript level. However, this upregulation was not detected at the protein level. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 leads to deficits within the proteostasis network in vivo at baseline. Despite an upregulation of proteostasis-related genes at the transcript level in mutant TDP-43 mice after TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibit an impaired response to, and recovery from, brain trauma relative to their WT counterparts. Restoring proteostasis is expected to protect against the detrimental effects of TDP-43 dysfunction, especially under stress conditions that promote neurodegenerative disease.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

These observations suggest that sources other than granulopoiesis may supply neutrophils to the heart during the early hours post-MI. Using a combination of flow cytometry, BM ablation of hematopoietic stem cells, confocal microscopy and multiple proteomics analysis, we found that the first wave of neutrophils recruited to the ischemic heart is exclusively sourced from vasculature and not from granulopoiesis in the BM/ spleen.

StoPred infers stoichiometry directly from sequence or structure features for both homo- and hetero-oligomers, without requiring template assemblies or predefined composition. We benchmark StoPred against deep learning-based and template-based methods, and show that it achieves improved accuracy and efficiency across curated and blind datasets, with up to 16% and 41% higher top-1 accuracy for homomeric and heteromeric complexes, respectively, compared to the strongest prior method on our held-out test dataset.

Methods: We developed aiAtlas, a reliable computational system that integrates Large Concept Model (LCM) based causal inference with aiPSC derived simulation libraries. The platform encodes 25 core biological and cellular features, including apoptosis, DNA damage and repair pathways, cell cycle regulation, pluripotency markers, and the hallmarks of cancer, in weighted causal networks. Simulations were iteratively propagated using early-stopping algorithms, with statistical evaluation performed using Mann Whitney U tests, Hodges Lehmann estimators (HLE), and Cliff's delta with Hedges correction. Bonferroni-adjusted significance thresholds (p < 0.002) to compensate for multiple testing were applied. Results: Across 136 simulated aiPSC lines (10 wild type, 126 mutants), all 25 features demonstrated significant divergence between wild type and combined mutant states (median HLE -1.46, IQR -1.89 to -0.36). Subgroup analyses revealed distinct patterns: single mutations drove broad systemic changes; multiple mutations amplified genomic instability; human tumor-derived cell lines exhibited strong divergence but retained some overlap in repair and apoptosis pathways; and gene fusion models produced selective, intermediate phenotypes.

Using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we profiled iPSC-derived erythroid cells from CMS and non-CMS subjects under normoxia and hypoxia to identify statistically significant, disease-associated transcriptional and chromatin accessibility changes. RNA-seq revealed induction of inflammatory, stress, and erythropoiesis programs in CMS even under normoxia, including robust activation of JAK-STAT signaling, upregulation of heme metabolism and VEGF, and accelerated erythrocyte lineage commitment alongside repression of Notch and WNT/{beta} catenin. Hypoxia amplified this dysregulated state, and critically, activated NF{kappa}B-driven inflammatory signaling together with canonical HIF targets. ATAC-seq revealed pronounced hypoxia-induced changes, with increased accessibility within inflammatory and erythrocyte lineage genes occurring concomitantly with decreased accessibility within pluripotency and ectodermal lineage genes. Pharmacological NF{kappa}B inhibition in CMS cells significantly reduced EE (p value <0.0001), whereas NF{kappa}B activation in non-CMS cells was sufficient to drive EE (p value <0.01), confirming the causal role inferred by our multiomics analyses. Collectively, our multiomics and functional experiments substantiate a coordinated chromatin-transcription paradigm favoring an inflammatory axis that, through hypoxia-driven NF{kappa}B activation, accelerates stress-induced erythroid commitment and underlies EE in CMS.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "Objective: Several novel methods, including magnetogenetics and magnetoelectric stimulation, use high frequency alternating magnetic fields to precisely manipulate neural activity. To quantify the behavioral effects of such interventions in a freely moving mouse, we developed a dual-channel magnetic chamber, specifically designed for rate-sensitive magnetothermal-genetic stimulation, and adaptable for other uses of alternating magnetic fields. Approach: Through an optimized coil design, the system allows independent control of two spatially orthogonal uniform magnetic fields delivered at different frequencies within a 10 x 10 x 6 cm3 chamber suitable for mouse studies. The two channels have nominal frequencies of 50 and 550 kHz with peak magnetic field strengths of 88 and 12.5 mT, achieved with resonant coil drives having peak voltages of 1.6 and 1.8 kV and currents of 1.0 and 0.26 kA, respectively. Additionally, a liquid cooling system enables magnetic field generation for second-level durations, and an observation port and camera allow video capture of the animal's behavior within the chamber. Main Results: The system generates high-amplitude magnetic fields across two widely separated frequency channels with negligible interference (< 1%). Relatively uniform magnetic field distribution ({+/-}10% across 94% of the chamber volume) is maintained throughout the chamber, and temperature increase of the inner side of the coil enclosure during the operation is limited to < 0.35 /s to ensure in vivo safety. Using cobalt-doped and undoped iron oxide nanoparticles, we demonstrate channel-specific heating rates of 3.5 /s and 1.5 /s, respectively, validating frequency-selectivity. Both channels can run continuously for 4 seconds stably. Significance: We present a novel magnetic stimulation platform that combines high-frequency, high-power capability with two independently-controlled channels generating different frequencies, along with a real-time behavioral observation system for freely moving animals. The system supports frequency-multiplexed stimulation strategies for precise modulation of neural activity, making it a versatile tool for advancing magnetogenetics, neural circuit interrogation, and noninvasive stimulation approaches in neuroscience and bioengineering.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

We provide a protocol that is able to predict whether any given disordered protein sequence will bind to microtubuli. This protocol is suitable for high-throughput screening. Our pattern analysis allows us to establish two categories of strongly interacting subsequences that enable binding to microtubuli: positively charged hydrophobic clusters and alternating charge sequences. Their overall optimal balance is analyzed and preferential regions of interaction on microtubuli are identified and validated with known experimental results.

When released by sensory neurons, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) shapes immunity, a process known as neuroimmune communication. We previously showed that nociceptor-derived CGRP polarizes macrophages into pro-endometriosis macrophages (PEMs) that mediates endometrial epithelial (endo-epi) cell growth and pain. However, the key mediators involved in this PEM-induced cell growth were unknown. Using unbiased approaches, we discovered that nociceptor-derived CGRP induces IL-33 production by PEMs. IL-33 binding to its receptor ST2 is key for endometriotic lesion growth and pain during endometriosis in mice as anti-IL-33 antibody treatment reduced evoked and spontaneous pain as well as lesion size. Chemical or genetic ablation of nociceptors or macrophages also resulted in lower levels of lesion IL-33, demonstrating a neuroimmune-driven mechanism for IL-33 production during endometriosis. In humans, we found that IL-33 is correlated with increased number of glands and fibrosis in lesions and that IL-33 expression in macrophages is also associated with genetic risk of endometriosis. We also provided evidence that suggests a dual role for IL-33 in endometriosis, in which, it is initially required for lesion formation and later for lesion maintenance only, and associated pain. Therefore, targeting IL-33/ST2 signaling may effectively treat endometriosis pain.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

How do humans build cognitive maps in multi-scale environments? Cognitive maps are thought to be organized hierarchically, with local representations for subareas and global representations for the entire environment. However, it remains unclear how spatial learning influences the representations of multi-scale environments and their underlying neural mechanisms across different levels of representation. In the current study, we built a virtual environment (VE) with four orthogonally positioned rectangular rooms, each containing eight objects at the corners. Twenty-three healthy subjects completed a four-session spatial memory experiment conducted over two weeks. We measured their brain activity by using BOLD-fMRI at two stages: pre-learning stage and post-learning, when they were judging the relative direction between the objects within the VE. We found that with the progression of learning, the subjects shifted from relying on local, directional cues to using more global representations of the environment. At the neural level, the hippocampus (HIP), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) played distinct roles in encoding spatial information across the two learning stages. Specifically, after learning, the HIP shifted from local to global representations, while the RSC and OFC supported the integration of spatial information across these representational levels. In addition, the anterior cingulate cortex was involved in forming global representations, facilitating efficient spatial processing as learning advanced. These findings revealed how spatial learning leads to adaptive shifts in brain activity, contributing to the formation of cognitive maps in complex, multi-scale environments.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The monkeys performed a fixation task while their hand was positioned near a visual stimulus while either being visible or occluded, and compared with when the hand was away from the stimulus. When the near hand was visible, neural firing rates in V2 were significantly higher, accompanied by sharper orientation tuning. In contrast, occluding the hand broadened orientation tuning compared to when the hand was away. These effects emerged rapidly after stimulus onset and were coherent across the population, demonstrating that PPS is actively prioritized during visual processing. Together, the findings reveal two complementary (feedback) signals in V2: a congruence-driven enhancement when visual and proprioceptive inputs align, and a mismatch-driven suppression when they conflict, indicating that V2 integrates multisensory cues to encode PPS and support action-relevant visual processing.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Isolated MVP and physiologically normal hMVICs were embedded in poly(ethylene) glycol-based hydrogels containing fluorescent fiducial markers and 3D traction force microscopy via inverse modeling was employed to determine the local change in hMVIC hydrogels due to enzymatic degradation and collagen deposition. Results indicated pronounced hydrogel softening occurred generally further from the hMVICs, whereas stiffening occurred in close proximity to hMVICs due to collagen deposition as verified by collagen-staining. MVP hMVICs induced greater hydrogel stiffening and less degradation than normal hMVICs. Interestingly, even though MVP hMVICs had higher basal contractile displacements, their corresponding traction forces and hydrogel strain energy densities were significantly lower than those of normal hMVICs. These findings elucidate, for the first time, that MVP hMVICs have significantly altered biophysical contractile and ECM remodeling behaviors compared to normal hMVICs.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

K.; Agarwal, P.; Alekar, A.; Mallick, S.; Shah, J.; Basrai, M. A.", "abstract": "The kinetochore is a multiprotein complex formed at the centromeres and is essential for the faithful chromosome segregation. In most of the organisms the kinetochore is assembled on a specialized centromeric nucleosome where histone H3 is replaced by a variant, named CENP-A. In budding yeast, the CENP-A homolog, Cse4 is recruited to the centromeric nucleosome through an interaction between its C-terminal domain and a specific chaperone, named Scm3. Interestingly, following Cse4 recruitment during S phase, Scm3 persists at the centromeres throughout the cell cycle. Recent in vitro studies have reported that Scm3 also interacts with N-terminal of Cse4 (N-C) that in turn facilitates a better interaction of Ame1-Okp1 (AO) of COMA subcomplex with N-C, which promotes kinetochore assembly. In this work, using genetic and biochemical assays we provide in vivo evidence of the interaction between Scm3 and N-C. Additionally, by artificially tethering Scm3, we show that their association has the potential to stabilize a missegregating chromosome with inactive centromere, perhaps by forming an active kinetochore at an ectopic site. We propose that at the centromeres, Scm3 has two jobs in tandem - Cse4 deposition and stabilization of N-C, which together culminates into proper kinetochore assembly. This work has clinical significance as both CENP-A and its chaperone are known to be upregulated in human cells under disease states which can predispose the cells to aneuploidy due to increased chances of forming ectopic kinetochores.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The functional role of intracelular condensates is known to be tightly coupled to material properties such as viscosity and hydrophobicity, which act as phenomenological markers of cellular state in health and disease. In turn, the material properties of condensates essentially depend on their macromolecular composition and water content. Yet, available approaches for determining condensate composition systematically involve invasive processes that often result in the destruction of the tested sample. Here, we use Raman spectroscopy coupled with spectral phasor analysis, and develop an in situ and label-free approach that allows to resolve molecular concentrations of any chemical species within aqueous polymer solutions and biomolecular condensates. In addition to quantifying the protein-to-water volume ratio, our method allows to quantify the degree of client molecule partitioning inside condensates. We show that water hydrogen bonding resulting from protein hydration can be quantified via this approach, and find that the overwhelming proportion of water molecules within condensates largely retain their bulk-like properties. Lastly, by coupling our characterization approach with environment-sensitive fluorescent dyes we investigate the molecular origin of condensate hydrophobicity. Our results show that the hydrophobicity of condensates is by a combination of the presence of structural motifs in the backbone of polymers constituting the scaffold, and the degree of water partitioning inside condensates.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Still, current approaches face challenges of limited sensitivity at low tumor fractions, technical variability, and poor generalization across cohorts. Tumor-informed targeted approaches can have high specificity but low sensitivity due to random sampling, tumor adaptation and evolution (including the development of resistance mechanisms), and other sources of heterogeneity; on the contrary, genome-wide tumor-naive approaches can increase sensitivity but tend to have a lower specificity, especially at low tumor fraction. We developed Fragmentomics Analysis for Tumor Evaluation with AI (Fate-AI), a multimodal framework that integrates fragmentomic and methylation-derived features from low-pass whole-genome sequencing (LPWGS) and cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq). It leverages a knowledge-informed strategy to select recurrently altered genomic regions and tissue-specific methylation loci to combine the advantages of tumor-naive approaches with the specificity of tumor-informed approaches. This approach derives robust per-sample normalized features that mitigate batch effects and enhance cross-cohort reproducibility. We evaluated Fate-AI on a total of 1,219 plasma samples spanning ten cancer types and healthy controls from multiple laboratories and sequencing centers, including 432 newly profiled cases (280 with both cfMeDIP-seq and LPWGS) together with 787 samples from four independent public datasets. Fate-AI achieved superior sensitivity and specificity compared to state-of-the-art methods, detecting tumor-derived signals at fractions as low as 10-5 in experimental dilutions. Fate-AI scores correlated with disease stage and tracked longitudinal progression, anticipating relapse months before clinical progression. Furthermore, Fate-AI enabled tissue-of-origin classification, with AUCs ranging from 0.84 to 0.97 across six cancer types.

Differences between captive and free-ranging environments may impact how the cardiovascular system adapts with age, potentially confounding studies of natural aging. This study characterized age-related cardiac phenotypes in free-ranging rhesus macaques and compared these patterns with their captive-housed counterparts to assess the influence of living environment on cardiac health across the lifespan. Methodology: We performed transthoracic echocardiography in a cross-sectional cohort of 133 free-ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta, aged 7 to 25 years, 41 % female) living on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. First, we compared structural and functional cardiac parameters between young (7 to 12 years; n = 48, 60% female) and old (18 to 26 years, n = 33, 42% female) free-ranging macaques. We then performed an ANCOVA, with age as a covariate, to compare cardiac structural and functional parameters between free-ranging and captive-housed macaques (n = 347, aged 7 to 32 years, 71% female). Results: In our free-ranging cohort, older macaques had greater interventricular septal thickness and relative wall thickness (RWT) than young. Males exhibited larger left ventricular (LV) internal dimensions, wall thickness, LV mass, and LV volumes than females, but these differences were attenuated when indexed to body mass. Diastolic function was lower with advanced age in both sexes, reflected by a lower E/A ratio, reduced myocardial tissue velocities during early diastole (e prime) and greater myocardial tissue velocities during atrial contraction (a prime). Compared with captive macaques, free-ranging animals exhibited better diastolic function, including a significantly higher E/A ratio, greater e prime, and lower a prime. Captive macaques also had significantly greater relative wall thickness across age and between sexes. Conclusions and implications: Our study provides the first comprehensive characterization of age-related cardiac differences in free-ranging rhesus macaques, which show structural and functional cardiac differences similar to those observed with human aging. Captive macaques exhibited a more pronounced age-related cardiac phenotype than their free-ranging counterparts, including thicker left ventricular walls and lower diastolic function for a given age.

To our knowledge, this is the first report to quantify these changes. High CLL marrow infiltration was associated with a 40.3% reduction in lacuna density and a 101% increase in the normalized adipose surface area-to-volume ratio, a metric indicating greater structural fragmentation. Both changes correlated with leukemic infiltration percentage and showed partial reversal after therapy in a longitudinal case. Furthermore, high CLL burden significantly altered the morphological distributions of the remaining lacunar osteocyte (p < 0.001).

Single cell-RNA sequencing analysis of human tissue demonstrated significant differences in PD1/GPR37 axis-related genes in macrophages in AAAs compared to control aortic tissue. Using an established murine AAA model, PD1 administration significantly attenuated aortic diameter, pro-inflammatory cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2) expression, as well as maintained aortic morphology in a GPR37-dependent manner. Importantly, PD1 treatment prevented preformed AAA progression to aortic rupture in another preclinical elastase+BAPN model of aortic rupture, by attenuating aortic diameter, tissue inflammation as well as decreasing macrophage infiltration, preserving elastin integrity, and restoring smooth muscle -actin expression in the aortic wall. Mechanistically, PD1 enhanced macrophage efferocytosis of apoptotic vascular smooth muscle cells in the murine aortic tissue as well as in isolated macrophages via GPR37-dependent manner and attenuated the inflammatory paracrine secretion of macrophage-specific paracrine release of TNF- and IL-{beta}. These findings suggest that PD1/GPR37 signaling on macrophages promotes inflammation-resolution by enhancing efferocytosis of apoptotic SMCs conferring protection against aortic inflammation and remodeling to mitigate AAA formation and rupture.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

To define age-dependent cardiac transcriptional responses to isoflurane exposure and operative (ISO/OP) stress, we analyzed gene expression profiles across young adult (3m), late middle-aged (17m), and geriatric mice (27m) following short-term 2 h ISO/OP exposure. At 24 h after cessation, all age groups exhibited distinct cardiac transcriptional signatures separating ISO/OP from sham controls. In young adult hearts, transcriptional alterations 24 hours after cessation of ISO/OP were characterized by dysregulation of small molecule catabolic processes, fatty acid metabolism, disruptions to protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum and cytoskeletal organization. Late middle-aged mice displayed amplified perturbations in lipid metabolism alongside suppression of muscle system and calcium signaling pathways, while old mice showed robust activation of PPAR and AMPK signaling and downregulation of genes governing contractility and morphogenesis. In contrast, geriatric mice showed upregulation of fatty acid metabolic pathways, robust activation of PPAR and AMPK signaling, coupled with suppression of muscle differentiation and actin organization following ISO exposure, indicating a maladaptive metabolic reprogramming. Overlapping DEGs across all age groups converged on pathways regulating oxidative stress, Ca2+; handling, hypertrophy, and energy metabolism, suggesting a conserved but age-intensified cardiac stress response. Longitudinal profiling in aged mice revealed persistent transcriptomic remodeling five weeks after stress. Crucially, this remodeling was observed even after ISO exposure alone, indicating that general anesthesia is a primary driver of this long-term effect.

Previous work has shown that this trophic switch is accompanied by overflow metabolism and the production of lactate in aerobic conditions. This trophic switch is not observed in nutrient replete media. We utilized isotopically assisted metabolic flux analysis to characterize intracellular flux distributions that are associated with different metabolic phenotypes observed in this organism in different media formulations in light and dark conditions. The results of this analysis showed differences in flux through carbon fixation reactions, the TCA cycle and through the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. This analysis was complemented with transcriptomics data collected for C. zofingiensis grown in iron limited conditions to provide further evidence towards the negative impact of iron limitation on both photosynthetic and respiratory activity. Overflow metabolism allows this alga to compensate for the lower energy production that results from iron limitation. This work highlights how nutrient availability can lead to drastic changes in the metabolism of C. zofingiensis.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The basis for these differences is not known. We examined whether the asymmetries are present in early cortical color coding by comparing the strength of hue differences using visual evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from occipital cortex. Stimuli were spatial gratings with a fixed nominal contrast in the cone-opponent plane that varied sinusoidally in hue rather than saturation. The responses to different levels of hue separation were measured by the amplitude of the frequency-tagged signals and also in behavioral measurements employing a contrast matching task. For both, the same separation in hue angle resulted in stronger responses for angular differences centered on the yellow quadrant of the cone-opponent space. Responses were also larger for the yellow than blue quadrant, ruling out a general sensitivity loss to the blue-yellow axis as the basis for the differences. The responses differences paralleled the asymmetries in the rates of change in color appearance based on analyses of previous measures of hue scaling functions. The presence of these asymmetries in the VEP responses suggests that they arise relatively early in the cortical sensory representation of color rather than emerging late as a product of inference or color category learning.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Some accounts propose that WM is supported by abstract representations so that new sensory inputs do not interfere with existing memories. Others posit that early sensory representations are recruited to maintain memory precision, potentially at the cost of interference caused by new inputs. Here we tested these accounts using an orientation recall task to determine whether memory errors reflect interacting representations of sensory and mnemonic information. We found that adding noise to the memoranda and presenting feature-neutral distractors independently increased recall errors. However, distractors that shared a feature with remembered stimuli led to systematic attractive biases such that memory errors were pulled toward the orientation of the distractor. The magnitude of this bias was modulated by both stimulus noise and whether the distractor was behaviorally relevant. Our results demonstrate that while working memory can utilize abstract representations, it remains susceptible to feature-specific sensory interference, suggesting partial reliance on sensory-like codes.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Here we demonstrate that trehalose-derived glucose flux is essential for sustaining glycolysis and maintaining cellular energetics during metamorphosis in Helicoverpa armigera. Disruption of trehalose synthesis through silencing of trehalose 6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase (TPS/TPP) or paramyosin (Prm) produced defective eclosion and alike fragmented muscle fibers. Metabolic profiling revealed broad depletion of glycolytic intermediates and cofactors consistent with elevated AMP and activation of energy-stress signalling. Transcriptome analysis also showed downregulation of the transcription factor E2F/Dp, along with reduced expression of cyclin/CDK components, indicative of cell cycle checkpoint dysregulation. E2F/Dp repression resulted in lower expression of Mef2, Prm, MHC, and other sarcomeric components, causing defective muscle development and weakened muscle architecture. Gene set enrichment analysis, gene regulatory network and promotor binding analysis confirmed E2F binding motifs within promoters of trehalose metabolism and myogenic genes, suggesting a potential metabolic-transcriptional connection. Furthermore, dietary trehalose supplementation partially rescued metabolic depletion and restored expression of E2F targets in TPS/TPP- and E2F/Dp-silenced insects.

Such a process is called evolutionary branching in adaptive dynamics theory. In one-dimensional trait spaces, the existence of an evolutionary branching point ensures evolutionary branching of an asexual monomorphic population in its neighborhood under rare and small mutations. An evolutionary branching point is a convergence stable point (i.e., a point attractor for a monomorphic population through directional selection) that is not an ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy). For analysis of arbitrary higher-dimensional trait spaces with respect to evolutionary branching induced by convergence stable non-ESSes, this study develops two kinds of criteria. The two criteria, referred to as branching possibility and branching inevitability, are based respectively on the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics theory and on the local Lyapunov function. The branching possibility ensures the existence of evolutionary paths achieving evolutionary branching. The branching inevitability ensures steady progress of evolutionary branching through repeated invasions by arbitrary mutants having positive invasion fitnesses, even when the timescale separation between population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics is incomplete.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Using 52,670 subgroup scan samples collected between 1997 and 2020, we compiled yearly association matrices among the sexually mature individuals of a wild group of spider monkeys, based on spatio-temporal co-occurrence in subgroups. We built Bayesian edge-weight models with the association matrices and generated 1000 samples of each yearly network, which we then used as layers in temporal multiplex networks. For each female with adult tenure [&ge;] 5 years (n {equiv} 17), we estimated strength and eigenvector versatility in the multiplex network that comprised the last 5 years of her tenure. We also estimated six (monolayer) centrality-based metrics in the yearly networks of females with adult-tenure [&ge;]1 year and at least one recorded offspring born in the group (n {equiv} 22). We tested the influence of these eight indicators of social integration as predictors of offspring production and survival.

Here, we develop and apply coarse-grained simulations incorporating a temperature-dependent Mg2+-phosphate potential to elucidate how electrostatics, stacking, and hydration collectively determine ssRNA behavior. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce experimental SAXS profiles across a broad range of ionic conditions and reveal a non-monotonic temperature dependence of RNA compaction: ssRNAs expand upon heating, reach a sequence-specific maximum size, and then collapse as enhanced counterion condensation dominates. Rising temperature strengthens ion-RNA interactions, leading to a reorganization from diffusive to inner-sphere coordination, directly linking RNA collapse to ion dehydration. Our results establish that the ion atmosphere is a dynamic, sequence-encoded extension of RNA structure. This framework provides molecular insight into how temperature and ions govern RNA conformational transitions, offering a microscopic basis for RNA thermoadaptation, cold-induced misfolding, and RNA phase transitions.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Many organisms have evolved both cell-intrinsic and intertissue signaling pathways that integrate metabolic status. However, how this information is encoded in molecular signals is currently not well understood. Here we show that the nematode C. elegans employs lipidated neurohormones that combine the neurotransmitter octopamine and fat metabolism-derived building blocks to relay information about lipid metabolic status and drive inhibition of aversive olfactory responses during food removal. Using targeted metabolomics, we show that lipidated neurohormone synthesis requires the carboxylesterase CEST-2.1, which links octopamine-glucosides with endogenous methyl-branched or diet-derived cyclopropane fatty acids that act as agonists of the nuclear receptor and master regulator of fat metabolism, NHR-49/PPAR. Loss of cest-2.1, loss of bacterial cyclopropane fatty acid production, or loss of endogenous biosynthesis of the methyl-branched fatty acid substrates of CEST-2.1 mimics the behavioral responses of animals lacking octopamine, indicating that regulation of neurotransmitter-dependent behavior is linked to the coordination of fat metabolism via NHR-49/PPAR. Biosynthesis and subsequent neuromodulation via lipidated neurohormone relies on an intertissue trafficking pathway in which octopamine is shuttled first into the intestine where it is chemically modified, which is likely followed by neuronal import and intracellular hydrolysis to finally release free octopamine. We propose that esterase-dependent synthesis and subsequent hydrolysis of lipidated neurohormones represents a chemical encoding mechanism by which animals integrate information from neurotransmitter signaling and lipid homeostasis to direct appropriate behaviors.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

However, some evidence suggests that these muscles, or even subregions within them, can be controlled independently. In this study, we investigated whether humans can dissociate neural input to VM and VL during isometric contractions. Ten participants received real-time feedback from multiple intramuscular EMG electrodes that targeted different regions of the VM and VL while attempting to activate each muscle or sub-regions selectively. We found that nine out of ten subjects were able to clearly separate VM and VL activity based on the intramuscular EMG feedback. However, motor unit decomposition from the intramuscular EMGs revealed that selective recruitment of a unique set of motor units was possible only within the proximal region of VM. In contrast, VL and distal VM showed highly correlated activation, indicating tight functional coupling. Correlation analyses confirmed that the proximal VM exhibited distinct activation profiles compared with both distal VM and VL, supporting the existence of compartmentalized control within VM.

Increasing evidence implicates the blood-central nervous system (CNS) barriers in disease development, highlighting the importance of identifying genetic risk factors linked to cells forming the cerebrovasculature to advance this emerging area of research. The objective of this study is to identify PD genetic risk factors associated with blood-brain (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSFB) barriers, and to validate protein localization in human tissue and experimental models. To do so, we integrated genome-wide association studies and single nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets from the human postmortem substantia nigra (SN), midbrain, or cortical samples from control and PD donors. An in-depth bioinformatics analysis identified genes enriched in cell types that form the multicellular architecture of brain barriers, including CAVIN2, ANXA1, ANO2, and LRP1B. We further validated whether corresponding proteins were present in cell types associated with the blood-CNS barriers in human and mouse post-mortem tissues, as well as in iPSC-differentiated cells and choroid plexus organoids. Results showed that quantifying the proportion of endothelial cells expressing PD-related genes was under-evaluated at the transcript level compared to immunofluorescence analyses. In addition, we observed that CAVIN2 and ANXA1 proteins were more abundant at the vasculature of the substantia nigra vs. cortex, and CAVIN2 protein levels were reduced in PD vs. control human postmortem tissues. In contrast, the investigation of mouse postmortem samples demonstrated that the CAVIN2 protein is only present in a subset of mouse blood vessels, compared to nearly all vessels in human tissue. Similarly, mouse ANXA1 protein localizes to dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and not at the vasculature, as seen in human tissue. The primary outcome of this study is the identification of PD-relevant risk genes specifically expressed at brain barriers and enriched in PD-relevant brain regions. The secondary outcome is the demonstration of poor transcript-protein correlation in - at least - a subset of PD risk factors, and a low interspecies conservation of protein localization for the selected candidates. In conclusion, the BBB and BCSFB may represent understudied contributors to PD, endothelial-specific proteins appear differentially regulated compared to transcripts, and experimental models require comprehensive validation to ensure relevance to the human condition.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The parasitoid Sclerodermus guani is its important natural enemy. However few studies have jointly considered host plants and enemy effects when predicting pest ranges. We applied the optimized MaxEnt model and, on this basis, constructed two models: the \"host-pest\" model and the \"host-pest-enemy\" model, to predict the potential global distribution of S. bifasciatus under future scenarios and to explore the effects of climate change and the introduction of biotic interactions. RESULTS: Results showed that the climate-only model projected 2.73 x 10 6 ; km2 of suitable area under the historical climate condition, concentrated in Asia, North America and Europe, with expansion toward higher latitudes. The expansion of host plants further enhanced pest habitat suitability, nearly doubling the predicted range (5.46 x 10 6  km2) and increasing the mean suitability. Moreover, the potential distribution of S. guani overlapped extensively with S. bifasciatus, reducing the total suitable area of S. bifasciatus by up to 2.67 x 10 6  km 2, and mean suitability declined by nearly 40%, indicating effective suppression of pest risk. Centroid shifts were consistently northward, though magnitude and fragmentation varied among models.

This study provides a genomic characterization of two MDR E. coli strains, MBBL4 and MBBL5, from bovine mastitis in Bangladesh, highlighting their evolutionary relationships, resistome, and virulome. Methods: Species-level identification of MBBL4 and MBBL5 was confirmed using biochemical assays, VITEK-2 system, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiling was conducted to determine their resistance patterns. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) and comprehensive genomic analysis were performed for phylogenetic, comparative genomics, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), and virulence factor genes (VFGs) analyses. Results: Both isolates exhibited extensive MDR patterns, showing resistance to ten antibiotics. Phylogenetic and ANI analyses showed that MBBL4 clustered with mastitis-associated and human bacteremia strains of E. coli, while MBBL5 was closely related to wildlife-associated strains, reflecting divergent evolutionary lineages. Pangenome analysis revealed an open pangenome structure, indicating high genetic diversity, with MBBL4 harboring 21 unique genes and MBBL5 possessing nine unique genes. Both genomes harbored numerous ARGs spanning over 11 antibiotic classes, and VFGs, predominantly associated with adherence and secretion systems, underscoring their extensive resistome, virulome, and adaptive potentials. Abundant MGEs (plasmids, prophages, insertion sequence elements and genomic islands) further underscored the role of horizontal gene transfer in driving resistance and virulence in these strains.

Using bioinspired computational and robophysical models of cockroach antennae, we introduce the notion of tactile tensors--spatiotemporal representations of tactile stimuli shaped by contact location, feature type, and active touch speed. Our analyses show that cockroach-inspired antenna mechanics and active touch speeds significantly improve feature classification accuracy compared to conventional sensors by increasing tactile data sparsity and dispersion. Through sim-to-real transfer, these principles were successfully demonstrated on a miniature distributed soft robotic antenna, validating their effectiveness in real-world robotic systems.

This technical report introduces GeoFlow-V3, a unified atomic generative model for structure prediction and protein design. GeoFlow-V3 delivers improved accuracy on antibody-antigen complex structure prediction relative to our previous version, and its performance is further enhanced when experimental constraints or prior knowledge are provided, enabling precise control over both folding and design. The model also demonstrates reliable ability to discriminate binders from non-binders based on its confidence scores. Leveraging this capability, we build a GeoFlow-V3 in silico pipeline to design no more than 50 nanobodies per therapeutically relevant target de novo, completing a single round of wet-lab characterization in under three weeks.

S.; Jones, A.; Rigden, D. J.", "abstract": "Background As sequencing technology improves, more genomes become available. Most lack annotation, automated methods are error prone, and few genomes are ever manually curated due to time and cost. Protein structure prediction software may provide new angles for assessing and improving gene models without requiring experimental data. In this paper, we explore whether scores from protein structure prediction can aid in scoring gene model quality. We chose three species (Fusarium graminearum, Toxoplasma gondii, and Aspergillus fumigatus) from the VEuPathDB database which have collectively undergone more than 1000 manual curation events. We modelled translations of the gene models with AlphaFold 3, before and after curation, collecting various scores. Then we carried out structure searching of the PDB with Foldseek and sequence-based domain identification using InterProScan. We profiled the scores produced by these methods to identify those best for gene model assessment. Results AlphaFold 3 scores strongly favoured manually improved over pre-improvement models, supporting 75% of manually-curated changes in F. graminearum, 65% in T. gondii, and 84% in A. fumigatus (the lower percentage in T. gondii attributed to a high level of disorder). Further, combining scores across multiple tools (AlphaFold 3, Foldseek and InterProScan) provided additional improvements in model scoring. Conclusion Overall, the most discriminative scores combined outputs of AlphaFold 3 and Foldseek. Our results therefore highlight the potential of scores derived from deep learning-based protein structure prediction for scoring gene models in the absence of experimental data. Future work should focus on intrinsically disordered regions and developing integrated tools to apply this approach.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

We now define the cellular basis for this observation by identifying a resident cell in the colonic crypts, the Neuro-Immune Crypt-Associated (NICA) cell, characterized by a unique triple phenotype: neuronal (ChgA, TH, peripherin, somatostatin, NSE), robust stemness markers (LGR5, CD133, Glut3, ASCL2, {beta}-catenin), and a diverse array of innate immune molecules (TLR4, CD80, SDF-1). These markers (excluding ChgA) are retained in malignant CRC sections, demonstrating lineage persistence. Functioning as a pathogen gateway, NICA cells express viral entry receptors and the CXCR4 ligand SDF-1, rendering them susceptible to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection and subsequent immune cell recruitment. Crucially, we define a novel oncogenic intermediate: the BLEICS (B-Lymphocyte, EBV-Infected, Calamari-Shaped) cell, which exhibits a B cell-myeloid hybrid signature and high CXCR4. The fusion between BLEICS and crypt cells, facilitated by fusogenic Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) envelope proteins, generates the malignant, hybrid CRC lineage. Furthermore, BLEICS cells actively engage cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) via the CXCR4-SDF-1 axis to drive stromal expansion and crypt enlargement. In the resulting CRC cells, the overexpression of the transcription factor REST actively suppresses the neuronal identity (e.g., TH, ChgA), thereby maintaining the proliferative stemness phenotype (LGR5). The specific loss of ChgA in CRC is attributable to REST activity. We show that REST ablation restores ChgA expression and reinstates neuronal differentiation and induces growth arrest, an effect mirrored by pharmacological REST inhibition using valproic acid. This study establishes a new pathogenesis model where the increasing density of lymphoid follicles and NICA precursor cells toward the rectum creates an ideal niche for viral-driven, immune-cell fusion, providing mechanistic targets for REST-driven differentiation therapy and EBV vaccination strategies.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

This property can be achieved at the population average level by combining the well-known antithetic integral feedback (AIF) loop into the target network. However, the AIF controller amplifies the noise of the output level, disrupting the single-cell level regulation of the system output and compromising the conceptual goal of stable output level control. To address this, we introduce a new regulation motif, the noise controller, which is inspired by the AIF loop but differs by sensing the output levels through the dimerization of output species. Combining this noise controller with the AIF controller successfully maintained system output noise as well as mean at their original level, even after the perturbation, thereby achieving noise RPA. Furthermore, our noise controller could reduce the output noise to a desired target value, achieving a Fano factor as small as 1, the commonly recognized lower bound of intrinsic noise in biological systems. Notably, our controller remains effective as long as the combined system is ergodic, making it applicable to a broad range of networks. We demonstrate its utility by combining the noise controller with the DNA repair system of Escherichia coli, which reduced the proportion of cells failing to initiate the DNA damage response. These findings enhance the precision of existing biological controllers, marking a key step toward achieving single-cell level regulation.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) serves as a major output nucleus exerting tonic inhibition over thalamic and midbrain targets. However, how lipid metabolic disturbances affect SNr circuitry and dopaminergic regulation remains unclear. Here, we identify a crucial role for the lipid transport protein PDZD8 in maintaining basal ganglia circuit integrity. PDZD8 deficiency leads to marked lipid and lipofuscin accumulation selectively in the SNr, accompanied by enhanced striatal inhibitory inputs and reduced SNr projections to the ventromedial thalamus (VM) and midbrain dopaminergic nuclei (SNc, VTA). This circuit reorganization results in functional disinhibition and hyperactivation of dopaminergic neurons, producing maladaptive reinforcement of striatal inhibition. Our previous findings revealed that PDZD8 deficient mice exhibit hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and impaired fear memory, behavioral phenotypes reminiscent of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These findings demonstrate that lipid accumulation in the SNr disrupts inhibitory output and dopaminergic regulation, forming a maladaptive basal ganglia thalamocortical loop. Our study provides the first mechanistic link between lipid metabolic dysfunction, dopaminergic disinhibition, and ADHD like behavioral phenotypes, highlighting PDZD8 as a key regulator of metabolic circuit coupling in the basal ganglia.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Comparative approaches can help distinguish conserved from species-specific mechanisms, but their application has been limited by the lack of molecular tools beyond traditional model organisms, complicating direct comparisons of conserved and divergent mechanisms of neural function. This gap is particularly evident for the dopaminergic system, a key regulator of motivated behaviors across species and the principal pharmacological target for current psychotherapies. Building on our recent development of comparative gene editing, we here present an adeno-associated virus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to reduce in vivo dopamine receptors D1 and D2 levels across the rodent phylogeny. Using this approach, we achieved specific reduction of receptor levels in three rodent species (house mouse, prairie vole, and Syrian hamster), which we demonstrate with radioactive ligand binding assays. This toolkit expands the reach of comparative gene editing approaches, enabling functional investigation of the dopaminergic system across rodent species.

However, the role of cerebrovascular dynamics in shaping this interplay remains poorly understood. In particular, the interaction between cardiac autonomic control, ventilation mechanisms, and cerebral autoregulation is not well characterized, especially in ageing and post-stroke conditions, where cerebral perfusion is often compromised. In a cohort of 57 elderly participants, including 30 stroke survivors, we investigated the relationship between cardiac sympathetic activity and both, cerebral blood flow regulation and ventilatory status. Sympathetic reflexes, assessed via cardiac sympathetic index (CSI) during sit-to-stand transitions, were preserved across all participants, with no significant group differences between stroke and non-stroke populations. However, among individuals with constrained ventilation, indexed by reduced end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) at baseline, we identified a more elevated CSI following postural change, scaling with the degree of CO2 dysregulation. Furthermore, transcranial Doppler measurements revealed exaggerated changes in mean flow velocity (MFV) within the right middle cerebral artery in most participants. These MFV shifts significantly correlated with the magnitude of cardiac sympathetic change under orthostatic stress, suggesting that CSI can capture maladaptive neurovascular responses. Together, these findings highlight a distinct cardiac-neurovascular crosstalk in elderly individuals, revealing a potential mechanism of compensatory overactivation under impaired cerebrovascular control.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

N.; Burkitt, A. N.", "abstract": "Understanding how the cortex encodes sensory input in a biologically efficient and computationally robust manner remains a central question in neuroscience. Predictive coding offers a compelling theoretical framework for such cortical processing, but existing models lack the biological detail to fully explain the function of the cortical microcircuits. This study introduces a spiking neural network model of layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1), grounded in predictive coding principles, to clarify how the thalamorecipient layer transforms feedforward input into prediction-error-like signals under realistic excitatory-inhibitory constraints and to yield testable circuit-level predictions. The model integrates structured feedforward input, distinct excitatory and inhibitory populations, and balanced lateral connectivity to simulate spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity. Network responses are systematically examined under spatially unstructured noise input and structured grating stimuli. Neural membrane potentials encode real-time reconstruction errors between external input and internal estimates, with spikes dynamically correcting these mismatches. The network reproduces hallmark in vivo features, including irregular spontaneous activity, sparse and selective responses, and emergent orientation and phase tuning. Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) balance was maintained across conditions, with inhibitory neurons exhibiting tighter input coupling than excitatory neurons. Furthermore, the network exhibited contrast-dependent modulation of firing rates and E-I balance, dynamically adjusting its activity to changes in input strength. Decoding analyses demonstrates that structured inputs can be robustly reconstructed under moderate noise levels, although decoding fidelity declines sharply under severe corruption. Together, these results suggest that cortical layer 4 may serve as a structured sensory encoding stage in a hierarchical predictive coding system, providing a biologically grounded foundation for modeling prediction error computations in higher cortical areas.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

G i-coupled receptors can be considered as promising targets for the development of new neuroprotectors. Here, we studied the anticonvulsant activity of the agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of A 1 adenosine receptors (A 1 Rs). Our experiments demonstrate that A 1 R agonists, CCPA and N 6-cyclohexyladenosine (N 6-CHA), suppress hyperexcitation in three different in vitro models , including acute glutamate excitotoxicity, NH 4 Cl-and bicuculline-induced epileptiform activity. We have found that the inhibitory action of the agonists is mediated by the activation of not only the neuronal A 1 Rs but also the astrocytic receptors. In astrocytes, A 1 R agonists enhance GABA release, possibly via induction of calcium transients. Using inhibitory analysis, we have demonstrated that G{beta}{gamma}-mediated activation of phospholipase C and subsequent Ca 2+ mobilization from internal stores are essential for generating calcium transients in astrocytes following N 6-CHA application. We have shown first that Ca 2+-dependent activation of protein kinase C, which is involved in the mechanism of GABA release by astrocytes, is a pivotal step in the realization of the antiepileptic action of A 1 R agonists. Moreover, using the model of epileptiform activity induced by GABA A R blockade, we have shown that PAMs, PD81723 and VCP171, also suppress hyperexcitation. Furthermore, using the picrotoxin-induced epilepsy model in mice, we demonstrated that A 1 R agonists exhibit significant anticonvulsant effects and improve animal survival. The PAMs PD81723 and VCP171, when administered one hour before seizure induction, did not significantly affect seizure severity or survival rates. However, chronic administration of VCP171 produced a pronounced anticonvulsant effect and significantly increased survival.. Importantly, PAMs provided therapeutic benefits without significantly affecting overall activity levels in mice. Thus, our study demonstrates that both agonists and PAMs of A 1 R can be considered as potential therapeutic agents with antiepileptic and neuroprotective activity.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The hsdRMS genes on plasmid D may encode a type IIB restriction-modification system that protects the cells from invasion by foreign DNA. A variant of A. variabilis, strain FD, lacking plasmid D, grew with the same generation time as A. variabilis ATCC 29413, which stably maintained plasmid D. Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 and Nostoc sp. M131, which lack plasmid D and hsdRMS, grew similarly with a synthetic replicating plasmid, with or without added hsdRMS genes. Although the natural plasmid D was very stable in A. variabilis ATCC 29413, the synthetic plasmid was easily lost in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 and Nostoc sp. M131, with or without hsdRMS. Strain FD, lacking plasmid D, and an A. variabilis hsdRM deletion mutant were much better hosts for conjugation of a non-replicative, integrative plasmid than wild-type A. variabilis. The conjugative nonreplicating plasmid formed circular molecules in strain FD and in the A. variabilis hsdRM deletion mutant, allowing for a high percentage of single-recombinant exconjugants. In contrast, the relatively few exconjugants in A. variabilis were all double recombinants, suggesting that the restriction-modification system encoded by the genes on plasmid D resulted in only linear molecules that recombined by double crossovers. Expression of the hsdRMS genes in strains Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 and Nostoc sp. M131 drastically reduced conjugation frequency and recombination of a non-replicative plasmid. Together, these data indicate that HsdRMS acts as a defense against the successful transfer of foreign DNA into these cyanobacteria, likely by double-stranded DNA cleavage. Many cyanobacterial strains that are not amenable to gene transfer might have similar restriction-modification systems that lead to cleavage and subsequent degradation of foreign DNA. Although such systems inhibit gene transfer, they may yield a high proportion, although a low number, of gene replacement recombinants.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

However, for nearly 60 years, it has remained unknown how arginine metabolism supports EBV latency. To gain insights, we performed an amino acid restriction screen in Burkitt cell lines. This confirmed that arginine restriction was sufficient to trigger EBV reactivation in Burkitt B-cells and gastric carcinoma models. Arginine restriction strongly impaired de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, and CRISPR or chemical genetic blockade of pyrimidine biosynthesis enzymes induced EBV immediate early and early lytic gene expression. However, arginine restriction blocked EBV lytic DNA replication and consequently also late gene expression, suggesting an abortive lytic cycle. Arginine restriction triggered DNA damage, which was an important driver of arginine restriction-driven EBV reactivation.

The formation of their membrane-spanning lipids, known as glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), is catalyzed by the rSAM tetraether synthase and the subsequent cyclization of their lipid tails is performed by the B12-binding rSAM (B12-rSAM) GDGT ring synthase. Further, GDGT tails are cross-linked by the rSAM GMGT synthase and then methylated by the B12-rSAM GMGT methylase. Here, utilizing three archaeal model organisms, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, Thermococcus kodakarensis, and Methanosarcina acetivorans, we expand this repertoire of rSAM enzymes further, identifying two B12-rSAM GDGT methylases and a novel B12-rSAM GDGT desaturase. We also extend beyond the rSAM enzyme superfamily, identifying an AttH-like hydratase mediating hydroxy-GDGT (OH-GDGT) biosynthesis. Specifically, we identify two GDGT methylases in S. acidocaldarius and Thermococcus aggregans which possess different substrate specificities. While GDGT methylation is generally low in archaea, we observe high levels of lipid methylation in response to penicillin G and hexanoic acid amphiphile exposure, suggesting a role for lipid methylation in response to membrane-destabilizing chemical agents. Utilizing heterologous expression in M. acetivorans and T. kodakarensis, we uncover a novel B12-rSAM enzyme from Candidatus Bathyarchaeota B1_G15 with unusual tetraether desaturase (Ted) activity that seemingly reverses previous saturation by geranylgeranyl reductase, anaerobically forming double bonds in the inert hydrocarbon tails of a GDGT. Finally, we show that a non-rSAM AttH-like hydratase, genomically associated with Ted, is a hydroxy-GDGT synthase (Hgs), putatively hydrating the double bond(s) introduced by Ted to form OH-GDGTs.

Here, we show that a recently discovered chromatin mark, termed histone serotonylation (4), is involved in the collective migration of cranial neural crest cells - an embryonic multipotent stem cell population (5). Our in vivo data reveal that histone serotonylation appears in neural crest cells just before they start migrating and that its occurrence is essential to initiate their CCM. Surprisingly, we found that stiffening of the neural crest migratory substrate, the mesoderm, induces histone serotonylation by promoting nuclear translocation of transglutaminase 2 (Tgm2), the enzyme responsible for adding serotonin to histones (4). Moreover, mechanical and molecular perturbations demonstrate that mechanical shuttling of Tgm2 into the nucleus, with concomitant increases in histone serotonylation, are both required and sufficient to allow CCM in vivo. Furthermore, integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing analyses uncover a transcriptional module, which is enabled by histone serotonylation in response to mesoderm stiffening. Altogether, our results provide in vivo evidence showing that tissue stiffening leads to increased levels of histone serotonylation to reinforce permissive patterns of gene expression, supporting the switch from non-migratory to migratory cell states.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

It is also expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and forms heterodimers with VEGFR3 in LECs [1] while its participation in the process of lymphangiogenesis remains inadequately characterized. We show in this study that VEGFR2 is highly expressed in dermal initial lymphatic vessels and valves. The induced deletion of pan-endothelial Vegfr2 at the neonatal stage produced a potent suppression of dermal lymphatic growth, including the thinner lymphatic diameter, the decrease of LEC number and lymphatic valves. Mechanistically, the VEGFR2 insufficiency led to a dramatic decrease of VEGFR3, a LEC surface marker mediating essential signals for lymphatic growth and remodeling. The RNA sequencing analysis revealed that GO terms related to endothelial apoptosis, immune responses and proteolytic activity were enriched in the upregulated dermal genes of Vegfr2 mutants compared with the littermate controls. This was further confirmed by the RNA-seq analysis of dermal tissues 48 hours after the endothelial Vegfr2 deletion. Furthermore, there was no obvious difference in immune cells detected locally in skins or systemically in the Vegfr2 mutants, pointing to a direct endothelial reaction. Consistently, an inhibitory effect on the dermal lymphatic growth was also observed by targeting Vegfr2 in PROX1+ cells, manifesting a similarly altered transcriptome signature and the decrease of lymphatic size as well as the surface VEGFR3. The alteration of VEGFR3 expression was further validated by the siRNA mediated knockdown of Vegfr2 in primary lymphatic endothelial cells. Findings from this study imply that VEGFR2 is required for the maintenance of LEC identity and its insufficiency may trigger the endothelial stress to diminish the VEGFR3-mediated lymphangiogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Here we used mRNA display directed evolution to generate peptide ligands targeting Httex1 protofibrils, an early, toxic misfolding intermediate. Two distinct peptide families bind protofibrils, one tryptophan rich and the other glutamine rich, resulting in two predominant peptides HD1 (W-rich) and HD8 (Q-rich). Both peptides bind with high affinity and specificity to the misfolded polyQ structure present in protofibrils, a toxic component that is not recognized by existing huntingtin-directed antibodies. Homo- and heterodimers of HD1 and HD8 bind protofibrils with antibody-like affinity, and potently inhibit aggregation of recombinant and cellular Httex1. The HD8-1 heterodimer can be used like an antibody for immunocytochemistry to identify Httex1 aggregates in transfected cells and in the retina of a Huntingtons disease mouse model system (R6/1). Peptide binding to both in vitro and in vivo Httex1 validates in vitro generated Httex1 protofibrils share the same structural features as Httex1 amyloid from cellular and mammalian disease model systems. Further, HD8-1 protofibril recognition enables direct detection of a pathogenic form of Httex1 (misfolded polyQ) as a disease biomarker. Finally, HD1, HD8, and HD8-1 binding and aggregation inhibition defines the protofibril sites that mediate fibril growth. Overall, our observations support developing protofibril-directed ligands as novel, selective, diagnostics and therapeutics for Huntingtons disease.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The deglycosylated Fc fragment of the mAb was generated by proteolysis, and purified by ion exchange. Deglycosylation caused thermal destabilization of the glycosylated domain of the mAb, but there was no change in antigen (cocaine) binding or affinity. FITC fluorescent labeling of the deglycosylated mAb was suitable for qualitative assessment of cocaine binding. The thermal destabilization of the deglycosylated Fc fragment could be assessed by FITC labeling-based DSF, unlike the FITC-labeled control Fc fragment. This difference is due to the exposure of a secondary limited proteolysis site on the deglycosylated Fc, which increased accessibility and fluorescence labeling of Fc fragment lysine residues. Many of the methods and results in this study may be generalizable to numerous therapeutic mAbs, since the IgG1 anti-cocaine mAb shares the same glycosylation site and fully human heavy chain Fc sequence with other therapeutic human and humanized mAbs.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Their nucleotide-dependent allosteric cycle is modulated by ligand binding and co-chaperones, including nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). GrpE, the NEF for the E. coli Hsp70, DnaK, has been proposed to have a dual effect on the chaperone, facilitating the exchange of ADP for ATP in the NBD in a temperature-dependent fashion and promoting substrate release from the SBD. We recently reported NMR-based evidence that GrpE binding to DnaK has a direct structural effect on the SBD. Here, we expanded on these findings and obtained new evidence for a model in which the disordered N-terminal tails of GrpE facilitate peptide dissociation from the nucleotide-free DnaK/GrpE complex by transiently binding to the canonical substrate-binding site in the SBD. This GrpE/SBD interaction, while weak, is favored by the high local concentration of the tails around the SBD after complex formation. Moreover, we identified the DnaK binding motif in GrpE's N-terminal disordered tails as 17IIM19, which is conserved across many bacterial species. Excitingly, our data further suggest a mechanism for the temperature-dependence of GrpE's modulation of DnaK's refolding activity: as the temperature increases, unfolding of GrpE's coiled-coil weakens its contacts with the SBD, reducing N-terminal tail binding, and thus increasing DnaK affinity to substrates.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

In both immunocompetent and humanized leukemia-bearing mice, CNS-residing CAR T-cells were shown to have inferior ex-vivo killing capacities compared to CAR T-cells harvested from the spleen or bone marrow of receptive mice. In a mechanistic work-up, we identified two contributing factors: First, CAR T-cells cultured in cerebrospinal fluid showed impaired cytotoxic and proliferative function compared to those in serum or other media. Second, using a unique in vitro human blood-brain barrier (BBB) model composed of endothelial cells and brain pericytes, we demonstrated that CAR T-cells that crossed the BBB exhibited antigen-independent activation and diminished cytolytic capacity. This led to increased activation-induced cell death of the BBB-migrating CAR T-cells and was confirmed to be independent of the CAR target and the costimulatory domain.

One such pathway is regulated by the chloroplastic phosphatase, SAL, which hydrolyses the nucleotide signal 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP). In Arabidopsis thaliana, genetic loss of AtSAL1 elevates PAP and enhances stress tolerance but causes pleiotropic growth defects, complicating the interpretation of the role of PAP in cellular signalling. To uncouple stress signalling from genetic pleiotropy, we conducted a high-throughput in vitro screen of 13,000 small molecules and identified V20, a competitive inhibitor of AtSAL1 with three-fold greater potency than the known Li+ inhibitor. Structural analoguing of V20 and biochemical assays defined key pharmacophore features required for inhibition, including an ortho-halogenated aromatic ring, hydrogen-bond donor capacity at the triazole carboxamide, and electron-withdrawing substitutions that enhance {pi}-{pi} stacking with aromatic residues. Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations using a new high-resolution crystal structure revealed two previously uncharacterised V20 binding pockets adjacent to the catalytic site. V20 binding induces conformational changes that restrict substrate access to the catalytic site. Exogenous application of V20 to Arabidopsis led to increased PAP accumulation, activated PAP-responsive gene expression and enhanced oxidative tolerance, demonstrating cellular uptake and in vivo efficacy in the energy organelles, chloroplasts and mitochondria, where AtSAL1 is localised. Collectively, our findings reveal new insights into the regulatory domains of SAL enzymatic activity for control of PAP-mediated signalling and establish a proof-of-concept for targeted chemical modulation of SAL activity, which offers novel strategies to selectively manipulate chloroplast-to-nucleus retrograde signalling in plants.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

We combined in planta, in vitro, and environmental water microcosm experiments to determine if these two concerning strains are likely to co-exist in environments where they have become established or if one might be expected to displace the other. Using a representative strain from each subgroup we investigated the dynamics and fitness of these two Ralstonia pathogens across ecologically relevant environments. Interactions between the strains were context dependent: the presence of a competing strain had little impact on bacterial survival in river water microcosms, but the I-33 strain had a fitness advantage in wilt susceptible tomato plants. We found no evidence of direct growth inhibition by either strain in vitro. The IIB-1 strain persisted longer than I-33 in cool temperature river water microcosms. Warmer temperatures extended the culturability of both strains, which may be important as climate change warms surface water globally. Additionally, Ralstonia strains persisting in 20 degrees C water microcosms for 6 months were still able to cause disease in tomato plants.

Objectives: We investigated how perceived habitat heterogeneity translates into environmental variables. Then, we explored the effects of perceived habitat heterogeneity in remnant urban forests and parks on carabid beetle species richness, composition, and functional traits. Methods: We examined carabid beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) communities across three habitat types differing in perceived microhabitat heterogeneity: heterogeneous urban forests, homogeneous urban forests, and urban parks in Helsinki, Finland. Results: Environmental data confirmed distinct habitat characteristics: for most variables measured, heterogeneous forest sites were more variable compared to homogeneous forest sites. Contrary to expectations, species richness was higher in homogeneous forests and parks and lower in heterogeneous forests. Community composition differed among habitats and was influenced by canopy openness and dead wood. Heterogeneous forests harboured fewer macropterous and open-habitat species, while homogeneous forests had more brachypterous and generalist species, indicating differences in dispersal capacity and habitat preferences. Body size at the community and population levels, and mass at the population level were generally unaffected. Conclusions: These results suggest that while habitat heterogeneity shapes community structure and traits, species richness does not always increase with heterogeneity, highlighting complex relationships between environmental variables and beetle communities.

While computational approaches based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT). Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both bright-field and fluorescence data.

Exploratory kinetic modeling estimated rapid CSF water turnover (k ~ 0.09 min-1) under physiological conditions, reduced to k ~ 0.031 min-1 with acetazolamide suppression, consistent with prior isotope tracer studies. Together, these findings establish CSF-iDDxI as a sensitive, pharmacologically validated tool for quantifying CSF production and turnover.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "In the quest to create increasingly complex synthetic cell-mimicking systems, a wide range of DNA nanostructures have been developed to coat, permeabilize, sculpt, or otherwise functionalize lipid vesicles. In a complementary strategy, DNA architectures have been used as scaffolds to direct the growth of lipid membrane vesicles. However, no systematic attempts have yet been made to invert this strategy and use lipid vesicles as scaffolds for extended DNA super-assemblies, thereby realizing freestanding, membrane-mimicking DNA shells. Here we introduce a simple and broadly applicable method to implement this concept: DNA shells are first assembled on giant unilamellar vesicles and then liberated by surfactant-mediated liposome removal. We demonstrate the approach with two distinct classes of DNA tectons: a complex barrel-shaped DNA origami with programmable inter-subunit interactions, and a simple nanostar-inspired motif composed of only eleven oligonucleotides. The success of both strategies underscores the generality of our approach and the feasibility of creating shell-like compartments from different DNA architectures. This method enables the construction of tunable, DNA-only containers spanning the size range of eukaryotic cells, offering a fundamentally new type of compartmentalization for bottom-up synthetic biology.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

Split inteins consist of two independently translated fragments that must associate to become splice competent. They can be used for diverse posttranslational protein modifications. Using the ML Int&in algorithm, we predicted unnatural split sites in two of the fastest and most efficient split inteins, gp41-1 and NrdJ-1, to generate functional variants with fragments of reduced mutual affinity. We harness this feature to create conditional versions of these inteins by controlling the physical proximity of the intein fragments with a light-inducible heterodimerization system. The resulting light-activatable gp41-1 and NrdJ-1 inteins enabled blue light dependent control of Cre recombinase activity in mammalian cells, which we exploited to spatially control apoptosis via localized expression of truncated BID (tBID) and caspase-8. This work highlights the versatility of Int&in for designing conditional inteins for precise spatiotemporal protein regulation.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

A.; Hryhorenko, J. R.; Ghaemmaghami, S.", "abstract": "The proteasome maintains the integrity of eukaryotic proteomes by selectively degrading ubiquitinated protein substrates. Ubiquitination targets a wide range of substrates for degradation, including translationally stalled nascent chains, misfolded proteins, and properly folded but short-lived proteins destined for regulatory degradation. Distinct structural features and ubiquitination patterns across these classes of substrates remain largely undefined. In this study, we combine structural proteomics and time-resolved isotopic labeling to profile the modification sites, dynamics, and conformational properties of the human ubiquitinome. We show that proteins undergoing rapid proteasomal degradation are ubiquitinated at lysine residues that are normally buried within structured regions of their native conformations. We provide proteome-wide evidence that this high-flux subset of the ubiquitinome is enriched in newly synthesized proteins that have non-native conformations. Together, our findings demonstrate how the lack of structural integrity of misfolded nascent proteins influences their ubiquitination patterns and ensures proper proteasomal degradation.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

The antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of mAbs plays a key role in the antigen recognition, so its structural characterization is essential, as even a slight change to its Higher Order Structure (HOS) can impact the antibody's potency. Recently, 2D methyl NMR has been introduced as a powerful method to assess both the structure and integrity of therapeutic Fab fragments. However, the identification of methyl group resonances in NMR spectra remains rare since Fabs are large heterodimers of ~50 kDa. Here, we present the methyl group assignment of an IgG1 Fab produced in a cell-free system with an optimal isotope labelling. We first assigned 99% of the alanine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, and valine methyl groups of the therapeutic Fab targeting LAMP1 antigen. Building on this assignment, we propose a 'divide and conquer' strategy that exploits sequence identities to rapidly assign methyl groups of other IgG1 Fabs. We demonstrate that the assignment of the Fab's constant region can easily be transferred from one IgG1 to another and that the variable part of a new Fab can be assigned using smaller uniformly 15N,13C-labelled constructs. We applied our strategy to ipilimumab's Fab and, using the assignment of ipilimumab's variable part and Fab anti-LAMP1's constant part, we could transfer the assignment of 89% of the methyl-containing amino acids to the entire ipilimumab Fab without having to produce deuterated samples. This assignment strategy can be generalised to any other IgG1 Fabs provided that their constant regions are identical and the strategy can be adapted to accommodate the expression levels of the different variable domains. This new method drastically facilitates the Fab assignment process, making it suitable for the pharmaceutical timeline.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

B.; Crook, O.; Maiwald, A.", "abstract": "Protein design models have transformed protein engineering by enabling computational exploration of sequence spaces far exceeding experimental capacity. Yet different models applied to identical structures generate divergent outputs. These systematic differences reflect training data characteristics rather than random variation, but their patterns and malleability remain uncharacterised. We quantified how training data modality shapes systematic preferences across six architectures. Structure-conditioned models retain minimal unexplained taxonomic variance (<3%) after controlling for measurable protein properties, while sequence-only models show substantial residual taxonomic dependence (19-25%). This difference stems from distinct preference patterns: Structure-conditioned models favour compactness and stability, properties enriched in experimentally tractable structures; sequence-only models bias reflect organism identity more heavily when evaluating sequence quality. These systematic preferences constrain design space exploration in predictable ways. Generated sequences converge toward model-specific biophysical profiles, with both input template properties and training-derived preferences jointly determining outcomes. Fine-tuning demonstrates these patterns are malleable: training ProteinMPNN on alkaline-adapted proteins redirects preferences toward elevated isoelectric points and basic residue content while preserving structural compatibility. Systematic bias characterisation enables both prediction of design outcomes and strategic modification for target applications. As protein design tackles increasingly complex challenges, understanding how training procedures encode systematic preferences becomes essential for reliable engineering.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

E.; pinello, l.", "abstract": "Long-read sequencing can characterize complex genome editing-induced DNA sequence changes such as large deletions, insertions, and inversions that are difficult to detect using short-read sequencing. However, PCR amplification and sequencing errors complicate accurate variant detection, and existing analysis tools are not optimized for gene editing specific allelic outcomes. Here we present CRISPRLungo, a computational pipeline specifically designed for long-read amplicon sequencing of gene edited samples. CRISPRLungo incorporates unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based error correction and statistical filtering to distinguish true editing events from background noise, enabling robust detection of small indels and structural variants. Through systematic benchmarking using simulated datasets, we demonstrate that CRISPRLungo outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and read recovery. CRISPRLungo supports both Oxford Nanopore and PacBio platforms and identify previously undetected structural variant edits such as inversions in published CRISPR datasets. To demonstrate allele-specific edit quantification, we applied CRISPRLungo to analyze edited primary cells from a patient with harboring compound heterozygous SBDS mutations, accurately quantifying SBDS editing outcomes despite contaminating reads from the homologous SBDSP1 pseudogene. To maximize accessibility, we developed a fully client-side web application requiring no installation, making advanced long-read analysis accessible to researchers regardless of computational expertise.

G.; Pinckney, R.; Liu, S.; Biswas, A.; Potter, H.; Morris, E. R.; Basu-Biswas, A.", "abstract": "DNA:protein interactions involving large structural deformations of DNA underpin essential biological processes. Although correlative evidence suggests that local, sequence-encoded, mechanical properties of DNA can modulate its interactions with large bent-DNA complexes like nucleosomes, direct high-throughput measurements of programmable mechanical modulation of DNA:protein interactions remain lacking. DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that introduces negative supercoils in bacterial chromosomes via a process that involves extensive, nucleosome-scale, DNA wrapping around its two C-terminal domains (CTDs). Here we combine Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX), neural network predictions of DNA intrinsic cyclizability, and high-throughput DNA-compete binding assays to broadly reveal that sequence-encoded DNA mechanics tunes gyrase:DNA interactions by modulating wrapping of DNA around the CTDs. Further, we find that both genomic gyrase cleavage sites, and SELEX-enriched strong gyrase-binding sequences, display marked mechanical asymmetry: an extended region of flexible DNA facilitating wrapping around only one CTD exists on one half of the enzyme footprint. High throughput binding assays further reveal that strong binding to one CTD alone can compensate for weaker dual binding, suggesting that asymmetric attachment may have evolved to balance the need for stable anchoring with conformational flexibility required for catalytic remodelling. Additionally, we identify key GC-rich motifs that independently enhance gyrase:DNA interactions, also in an asymmetric fashion. Our findings establish sequence-encoded DNA mechanics as a tunable determinant of protein:DNA interactions and illustrate how functional asymmetry within a symmetric enzyme can couple stable substrate association with structural plasticity.", "date": "2025-10-21", "journal": ""}

PolyA length affects the durability and translational activity of both endogenous and exogenously delivered mRNAs. However, long polyA stretches can undergo recombination during amplification in bacterial plasmids, impairing the production of in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA with long polyAs. PolyA tail segmentation with heteronucleotide spacers has recently emerged as a solution. Here, we developed segmented polyA patterns that stabilize the sequence during DNA amplification and enhance mRNA translation. We designed 15 novel genetically modified polyA variants, differing in the length, placement, and frequency of spacers, and the overall length (from [~]120 to [~]200 nucleotides). We evaluated their stability in DNA plasmids and homogeneity, translational activity, and durability in cell culture of the resulting mRNAs, comparing them to A90 tail and other known solutions, including those from existing mRNA vaccines. Selected sequences were validated in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that even frequent heteronucleotide insertions produce functional polyA tails. The most notable enhancements in protein production were observed for a segmented tail exceeding 200 nt in length [A30(CA15)11; up to 6-fold compared to mRNA with A90 tails].
