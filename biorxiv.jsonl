While maternal thyroid disorders are known to cause developmental issues in humans, variation in maternal thyroid hormones in healthy mothers have also been found to correlate with infant and child phenotypes. This suggests a potential impact of maternal thyroid hormones on offspring phenotype in an eco-evolutionary context. In chickens, prenatal thyroid hormone treatment has been shown to influence embryonic gene expression and postnatal treatment to influence imprinting and learning. However, the potential long-term effects of maternal thyroid hormones on physiology and behaviour are unclear. This study aims to investigate the long-term effects of maternal thyroid hormones on behaviour, plasma thyroid hormone levels and brain gene expression using the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) as a model. Egg hormone levels were elevated by injecting unincubated eggs with either saline (control), T3, T4 or a mixture of T3 and T4. Social motivation, boldness and fearfulness to predators were tested shortly after hatching and as adults. Plasma thyroid hormone levels and pallial expression of thyroid hormone receptor A, type 2 deiodinase, and nuclear receptor coactivator 1 were measured in adulthood. We found no evidence that elevated thyroid hormone levels in eggs affected behaviour, plasma hormone levels, or gene expression. This is the first study examining the potential long-term effects of elevated maternal thyroid hormones within the natural range. Although we found no evidence of long-term effects, other traits may still be affected and remain to be studied.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

We used baseline lifetime stressor exposure and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a longitudinal sample of 150 adolescents enriched for anxiety and depressive disorders. We examined the cumulative lifetime stressor frequency and severity of five stressor characteristics: physical danger, interpersonal loss, humiliation, entrapment, and role change/disruption. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed at three time points: baseline, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. Linear mixed-effect models tested if the lifetime frequency and severity of these stressor characteristics and functional connectivity within and between frontoparietal, default, and ventral attention networks at baseline predicted anxiety and depression symptoms at three time points. Lifetime frequency and severity of humiliation and entrapment predicted both anxiety and depression symptoms. Lifetime frequency and severity of entrapment exposures predicted anxiety and depression symptoms after accounting for baseline depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Resting-state functional connectivity between default, frontoparietal and ventral attention networks did not predict either anxiety or depression symptoms after correcting for multiple comparisons. Our study highlights lifetime exposures to humiliation and entrapment stressors as central stressor characteristics predictive of prospective anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescence. Our results also suggest that resting-state functional connectivity within and between default, frontoparietal and ventral attention networks may be relatively weak predictors of prospective anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescence.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Advances in CRISPR technology are revolutionizing gene therapy and drug discovery. The advent of single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA seq) is generating granular level insight into CRISPR induced genomic changes both intended and unintended. However, analysis of single cell data necessitates expensive high-performance computing (HPC) clusters or large data servers. Analysis of the single cell data is currently limited unaffordable computational cost and the lack of open-source software tools. To address this, we present scEDIT, a fast, lightweight, portable, and standalone software for pre- and post-processing CRISPR editing data from the Tapestri single-cell DNA-seq platform. scEDIT is memory-efficient, multithreaded, and compatible with most UNIX based systems. Tests using a low-cost desktop and public single cell CRISPR data demonstrate that the tool can efficiently process raw sequences, identify cell barcodes, count unedited and edited amplicons per cell, and outputs detailed filtered reads. Analysis of the single cell CRISPR data reveals indel patterns shared between in vitro experiments and unique indel profiles detected for in vivo study. Results further demonstrate the ability of single cell analysis in providing quantitative insights into the true zygosity of edited cell population. Although data shows a linear relation between indel frequencies by read count and cell count details of indel share between difference cells can only be truly explored with single cell data. Furthermore, scEDIT can analyze massively parallel base editing in human hematopoietic stem cells providing insights into the base editing patterns for hundreds of gRNAs targeting GATA1 and HbF gene. Importantly, scEDIT detected low frequency unintended and potentially harmful deletions introduced during the base editing. The reanalysis of two independent studies demonstrated the efficiency, stability, and portability of scEDIT making it an invaluable tool for uncovering new insights into the single cell data with limited and inexpensive computational resources.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Biomaterials for muscle tissue engineering must guide cellular alignment while supporting cell proliferation and myogenic differentiation. Methods: Here, we describe the fabrication of a tissue-engineered construct consisting of a scaffold of aligned poly({varepsilon}-caprolactone) (PCL) microfibers coated in a dynamic covalent hydrazone crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel to support myoblast attachment, alignment, and differentiation. Norbornene modification of HA further enabled functionalization with fibronectin-derived arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide. Scaffolds were fabricated using melt electrowriting (MEW), a three-dimensional (3D)-printing technique that uses stabilization of fluid columns to produce precisely aligned polymeric microfibers. We evaluated scaffolds with fiber diameters of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m of non-coated, HA-coated, and HA-RGD-coated MEW scaffolds through immunocytochemistry and creatine kinase activity assays. Results: HA-coated and HA-RGD-coated scaffolds showed increased cellular attachment of C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts on all fiber diameters compared to non-coated scaffolds, with HA-RGD-coated scaffolds demonstrating the highest cell attachment. All scaffolds supported cellular alignment along the fibers. Cells differentiated on scaffolds showed anisotropic alignment with increased myotube formation on HA-RGD-coated scaffolds as seen by myosin heavy chain (MHC) staining. Highest creatine kinase (CK) activity on day 5 signified the successful differentiation of C2C12 cells into mature myotubes.

T.; Timp, W.; Ebenstein, Y.", "abstract": "An exciting feature of nanopore sequencing is its ability to record multi-omic information on the same sequenced DNA molecule. Well-trained models allow the detection of nucleotide-specific molecular signatures through changes in ionic current as DNA molecules translocate through the nanopore. Thus, naturally occurring DNA modifications, such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, may be recorded simultaneously with the genetic sequence. Additional genomic information, such as chromatin state or the locations of bound transcription factors, may also be recorded if their locations are chemically encoded into the DNA. Here, we present a versatile \"write-and-read\" framework, where chemo-enzymatic DNA labeling with unnatural synthetic tags results in predictable electrical fingerprints in nanopore sequencing. As a proof-of-concept, we explore a DNA glucosylation approach that selectively modifies 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) with glucose or glucose-azide adducts. We demonstrate that these modifications generate distinct and reproducible electrical shifts, enabling the direct detection of chemically altered nucleotides. We further demonstrate that enzymatic alkylation, such as the enzymatic transfer of azide residues to the N6 position of adenines, also produces characteristic nanopore signal shifts relative to the native adenine and 6-methyladenine. Beyond direct nucleotide detection, this approach introduces new possibilities for bio-orthogonal DNA labeling, enabling an extended alphabet of sequence-specific detectable moieties. The future use of programmable chemical modifications for simultaneous analysis of multiple omics features on individual molecules opens new avenues for genetic research and discovery.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

KIASORT trains channel-specific classifiers in a hybrid linear-nonlinear embedding space, capturing waveform features often missed by conventional linear methods. These classifiers then sort spikes by independently tracking each neuron, unconstrained by probe layout. Biophysical simulations showed that even sub-micron probe displacements induce neuron-specific waveform distortions that standard drift models cannot correct. In ground-truth benchmarks with heterogeneous, neuron-specific drift, KIASORT significantly outperformed Kilosort4 in recovering high-quality units, while maintaining real-time performance on standard CPUs.

Yet, there is little evidence on whether such product substitution interventions effectively prevent illegal or unsustainable harvesting and contribute to the recovery of threatened populations. Drawing on the Furs For Life (FFL) Zambia initiative, which supplied synthetic furs known as Heritage Furs to replace leopard skins traditionally worn during Lozi royal ceremonies in Western Zambia, we present an evaluation designed to test both the effects and causal mechanisms of substitution. Guided by the EMMIE framework, commonly used in crime prevention evaluation, we triangulated data from semi-structured questionnaires, law enforcement patrols, court records, camera trap monitoring, and stakeholder interviews conducted between 2018 and 2024. Qualitative analysis using the General Elimination Method was employed to assess plausible alternative explanations for leopard recovery. By 2024, adoption of synthetic furs among leopard fur users exceeded 80 percent, while self-reported ownership of authentic leopard furs declined by 70 percent. At the same time, patrol detections of leopard poaching incidents decreased, and camera trap density estimates increased from an average of 2.7 to 3.8 leopards per 100 square kilometers across the focal landscape. An integrated mechanism of change, derived from stakeholder perspectives, indicates that while substitution reduced demand, concurrent and reinforcing effects of counter-poaching and counter-trafficking operations were critical to leopard recovery. This study provides the first empirical link between a demand reduction initiative based on synthetic substitutes and measurable species population recovery.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "While significant progress has been made in understanding the heterogeneity in the NSCs, our understanding of similar heterogeneity among the more abundant transit amplifying progenitors is lagging. Our work on the NPs of the neonatal subventricular zone (SVZ) began over a decade ago, when we used antibodies to the 4 antigens, Lex CD133,LeX,CD140a and NG2 and FACs to classify subsets of the neontal SVZ as either multi-potential (MP1, MP2, MP3, MP4 and PFMPs), glial-restricted (GRP1, GRP2, and GRP3), or neuron-astrocyte restricted (BNAP). Using RNAseq we have characterized the distinctive molecular fingerprint of 4 SVZ neural progenitors and compared their gene expression profiles to those of the NSCs. Overall, we identified 1581 genes that were upregulated in at least one NP compared to the NSCs. Of these genes, 796 genes were upregulated in BNAP/GRP1 compared to NSCs; 653 in GRP2/MP3; 440 in GRP3; 527 in PFMPs. One gene in particular that emerged from our analysis that can be used to distinguish the NPs from the NSCs is Etv1, also known as Er81. Interestingly, PFMPs expressed high levels of the transcription factor GSX1, which has been shown to play important roles in regulating interneuron development in the forebrain. PFMPs are also highly express PDGFR, CSPG4 (NG2+) Olig2 and transcripts for olfactory receptors. PFMPs also express Sox10, Gjb1, Zfp488 and Myt1 which have been shown to be important for oligodendrocyte development. The top transcription factors with unique upregulation in BNAP/GRP1s were Zfp57, Hoxac6, and Zfp955a. Unlike the other NPs, the GRP1 and GRP2 NPs expressed many proteins involved in immune cell function. In contrast, the top downregulated genes in the NPs are those involved in cilia formation, consistent with the loss of cilia as neural stem cells become multipotential progenitors. We performed bionformatic analyses to provide insights into the transcription factor interactions that are likely regulating their development as well as the functional consequences of these diffferences in gene expression.

Background: Heart failure is associated with the accumulation of lipid derived aldehydes that form immunogenic protein adducts. However, the pathological impact of these aldehydes and aldehyde-modified proteins in heart failure has not been assessed. Histidyl dipeptides, such as carnosine found in the heart, bind to aldehydes, and their protein adducts. However, the effects of carnosine on heart failure or the antigenicity of aldehyde modified proteins have not been studied. Methods: Male, wild type C57BL/6J mice were subjected to either sham or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. To increase carnosine levels, they were placed on drinking water with or without Beta-alanine prior to surgery, and for the remainder of the study. Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography, and the levels of histidyl dipeptides, immune cell populations, and CD4+ T cell activation were assessed via LC-MS/MS and flow cytometry, respectively. Results: Myocardial levels of histidyl dipeptides decreased at both 3- and 8-weeks post-TAC. Supplementation with beta-alanine increased myocardial histidyl dipeptide levels, attenuated adverse cardiac remodeling, and reduced aldehyde stress. Carnosine formed covalent bond with protein-bound aldehydes in the failing heart, reducing their antigenic potential and decreasing activation of dendritic cells and CD4+ T cells in vitro. Beta-alanine supplementation decreased the population of CD11b+CD64-Ly6G+ neutrophils and CD4+ CD44+ effector T cells in the failing heart. Conclusions: Increasing myocardial carnosine levels reduces aldehyde stress, dampens maladaptive immune responses, and preserves cardiac function during heart failure. HIGHLIGHTS: Levels of endogenous dipeptide carnosine are depleted in failing hearts, while supplementation of the carnosine precursor beta-alanine increases myocardial carnosine and preserves cardiac function during heart failure. Heart failure is associated with increased activation and infiltration of CD4+ T cells and generation of aldehyde modified protein adducts in failing hearts. The free aldehyde moiety of aldehyde modified protein adducts activates CD4+ T cells through dendritic cell presentation and capping this moiety with carnosine diminishes their antigencity. Increasing myocardial carnosine levels diminishes aldehyde stress and activation of CD4+ T cells during heart failure.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

The current panzootic of genotype II is having a devastating impact on pig production in Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Hispaniola (Caribbean). Due to its high persistence and mortality rate, disease control policies require enhanced passive surveillance activities, wild boar depopulation, containment and other costly interventions, as a safe and effective vaccine is not currently available. Since 2007, several clusters have emerged far from both its original range, in South-Eastern Africa, and from other affected suid populations. These transmissions were likely caused by anthropogenic movement of contaminated material, facilitated by the persistence of the virus in the environment. The objective of this research is to understand the spatio-temporal dynamic of the ASFV panzootic, with a specific focus on clusters from mainland Italy. We mapped and analysed the virus spread using 228 whole-genome sequences available from online repositories and from the Italian cases/outbreaks, combined with their metadata. We inferred the pathogen phylogenies using a Bayesian phylodynamic model, with which we obtained a time-scaled and spatially explicit maximum clade credibility tree. Our results showed a non-negligible number of long-distance transmissions across regions or continents, coupled with dense local dynamics, particularly in areas where the disease affected a na&iumlve population. This study provides important insights on the ASFV introduction into many affected areas worldwide and highlights the crucial role of genomic surveillance to correctly track the pathogen spread, and to monitor the virus potential evolution.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we optimized and titrated the ATAC-seq protocol for cultured chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs) and obtained high-quality chromatin accessibility profiles from as few as 200 cells, even after cryopreservation. Integrative analysis of our ATAC-seq with published RNA-seq and tissue ATAC-seq datasets identified over 10,000 PGC-specific accessible chromatin regions (ACRs), many absent from somatic tissues. Reporter assays demonstrated activity of selected enhancers in cultured PGCs, while transcriptome integration revealed preferential association of PGC-specific ACRs with genes highly expressed at embryonic day 2.5. In vivo transplantation confirmed that these enhancers are active in an early-stage-specific manner, but become silenced upon gonadal settlement.

Importantly, the immune system also plays a critical role in tumor surveillance by recognizing and eliminating cells expressing neoantigens arising from somatic mutations. However, many cancers exploit immune checkpoint molecules like LAG-3 to dampen antitumor immunity. Elevated expression of LAG-3 within the tumor microenvironment contributes to immune evasion by suppressing cytotoxic T-cell activity. Consequently, inhibition of LAG-3 has emerged as a promising strategy for restoring immune function and enhancing anticancer immunity.

Diatoms are important microalgae that thrive in nutrient-variable environments. Determining how diatoms perceive and respond to P availability is therefore crucial for understanding their ecological success. P-limited diatoms use a calcium (Ca2+)-dependent signalling pathway to sense and coordinate cellular responses to phosphate resupply. Despite the importance of Ca2+ signalling for diatom environmental sensing, apparatus enabling Ca2+ signal decoding is poorly understood. Here, we characterise the repertoire of an important group of Ca2+ sensor proteins--Ca2+ dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Several PtCDPKs are transcriptionally upregulated under P starvation. To determine whether PtCDPKs can coordinate P-starvation responses or act to transduce Ca2+ signals induced by P resupply, we functionally characterised PtCDPK2. PtCDPK2 is highly expressed in P-limited cells and localises to the cell periphery, suggesting a role regulating plasma membrane processes. Further, PtCDPK2 is co-regulated with the transcriptional regulator of P-starvation responses, PtPSR1. PtCDPK2 expression is also coordinated with the induction of P-Ca2+ signalling, which is driven by depletion of cellular P rather than external P exhaustion, or growth limitation. Ptcdpk2 mutants have significantly reduced photosynthetic efficiency and alkaline phosphatase activity under P starvation, but we do not find evidence for a direct role coordinating downstream responses to P resupply. These findings suggest PtCDPK2 is essential for regulating P-starvation physiology and reveals a role for Ca2+-signalling apparatus in promoting diatom tolerance in low P environments.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

We assembled a chromosome-scale, annotated reference genome of H. erectifolium comprising 3.85 Gbp, and identified 71,475 genes supported by a tissue-specific gene expression atlas. Comparative morphological, physiological, and transcriptomic analyses under water limitation were conducted with cultivated and wild barley. H. erectifolium displayed a greater density of leaf veins and sclerenchyma cells, alongside rapid leaf rolling upon dehydration. Genomic comparisons revealed structural variations, independent transposon-driven evolution, and copy number expansions of desiccation-responsive gene families relative to barley. The transcriptional responses of H. erectifolium and barley to water limitation suggested contrasting drought-adaptation strategies: metabolic downregulation and survival prioritization in H. erectifolium versus maintenance of metabolic activity and competitiveness in barley.

The evolution of IAV populations at the within-host level, however, is still less well characterized. Improving our understanding of within-host IAV evolution has the potential to shed light on the source of new strains, including new antigenic variants, at the population level. Existing studies have pointed towards the role that stochastic processes play in shaping within-host viral evolution in acute infections of both humans and pigs. Here, we apply a population genetic model called the `Beta-with-Spikes' approximation to longitudinal intrahost Single Nucleotide Variant (iSNV) frequency data to quantify the extent of genetic drift acting on IAV populations at the within-host scale. We estimate small effective population sizes in both human IAV infections (N_E = 41, 95% confidence interval: [22-72]) and swine IAV infections (N_E = 10, 95% confidence interval: [8-14]). Moreover, we evaluate the consistency of the observed iSNV dynamics with Wright-Fisher model simulations. For the human IAV dataset that we analyze, we find that observed within-host IAV evolutionary dynamics are consistent with this classic model at the estimated low effective population size. However, for the swine IAV dataset, we find statistical evidence for rejecting the classic Wright-Fisher model as the only process governing within-host iSNV frequency dynamics.

Addressing both of these shortcomings, we develop the Occurrence Birth-Death Diffusion (OBDD) process. This process incorporates the sampling of fossil occurrences by extending the recently developed Fossilized Birth-Death Diffusion (FBDD) process, thereby taking advantage of a clade's entire fossil record to infer its evolutionary history. To mitigate the computational challenges associated with the OBDD process, we employ Bayesian data augmentation methods. We illustrate our approach with an empirical analysis of cetacean diversification. Our analyses show that the integration of fossils is essential to recover diversification rates and richness trajectories. More specifically, fossils included in the phylogeny are highly informative about past diversification dynamics, while fossil occurrences can help to refine estimates, but do not provide significant additional information when the phylogeny already contains many fossils. We make the OBDD available in the Julia package Tapestree.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

We identified both unique and shared CNVs across tissues, including alterations in key chromosomal regions such as 1q23.3, 1q32.1, and 8q24.3, which harbor oncogenes like MYC, MCL1, and BCL9. Losses in 6q25.2 affecting ESR1 were also detected. CNVs were enriched in genes related to the Hallmarks of Cancer, with TUM samples showing profiles associated with proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion; ADJ samples with growth suppression; and LEU samples with genomic instability. Pathway enrichment analyses revealed disrupted functions in DNA repair, extracellular matrix organization, and TP53 signaling in TUM. Notably, EGFR, ERCC4, and HSP90AB1 emerged as central nodes in interaction networks and may serve as markers or therapeutic targets. This is the first CNV profiling study of its kind in TNBC from Mexican patients, highlighting the importance of including underrepresented populations in genomic research to uncover distinct molecular signatures and potential diagnostic or therapeutic avenues.

In an effort to overcome daunting challenges in subsequent data analysis, people tend to employ excessively slow imaging and high resolution, both of which significantly prolong the acquisition. Here, using authentic and synthetic VEM datasets through image stack re-registration, we demonstrate the implications of 3D oversampling in maintaining structural information fidelity against high background noise. This provides a fact-based argument for a higher priority of improving the spatial sampling rate, particularly in the most difficult axial direction, than suppressing the image noise during a VEM acquisition. To accelerate VEM acquisition by leveraging the oversampled 3D context, we explore distinct machine learning-based methods for restoring serial images that contain either low-contrast snapshots or skipped sections. On the datasets of similar acquisition consumptions, 3D context-based (volumetric) denoising outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation and 2D denoising approaches. Furthermore, the volumetric denoising models can proceed in a self-supervised manner, thereby no longer relying on specific training datasets. This work is not only instructive for planning efficient large-scale acquisition on commercial setups but also benchmarks the methodology of optimizing VEM acquisition to facilitate automated image processing.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Autophagy, a cellular recycling process, is crucial for different biotic and abiotic plant stress responses. This study explores the autophagy role in Arabidopsis under Cd stress, using wild-type, autophagy-deficient mutants (atg5, and atg7) and overexpressing lines (35S:ATG5, 35S:ATG7). Cd exposure induced autophagy, as evidenced by ATG8a and ATG8a-PE accumulation, GFP-ATG8a fluorescence, and upregulation of ATG genes and proteins. Responses differed between Col-0 and Ws backgrounds, with Ws showing higher Cd tolerance. atg5 mutants were more sensitive to Cd, indicating the autophagy protective role, whereas ATG5/ATG7 overexpression did not significantly enhance Cd tolerance. Although oxidative stress may activate autophagy, ATG5/ATG7 overexpression did not significantly change the oxidative stress response. Notably, atg5 mutants displayed marked disruptions in metal/ion homeostasis under control and Cd conditions, reinforcing autophagy's role in ion homeostasis. In contrast, atg7 showed no significant differences from its WT (Ws), suggesting genotype-specific effects.

In male mating, both activation of mPOA and its inhibitory inputs are essential - a paradox previously ascribed to disinhibition. Here, we show that the mPOA largely lacks local inhibitory circuits, arguing against disinhibition. Instead, in vivo recordings reveal that mount-active mPOA neurons are suppressed prior to behavioral onset, and this inhibition negatively correlates with subsequent activation, consistent with post-inhibitory rebound firing (PIR). A biologically plausible conductance-based model demonstrates that synaptic inhibition interacts with T-type Ca 2+ currents - the ionic basis of PIR - to promote mPOA neuron firing. Experimentally, bidirectional manipulations of mPOA T-type Ca 2+ channels confirm this mechanism: knockdown reduces PIR and impairs male mating, while over-expression enhances mating. Together, these results identify PIR as a critical mechanism by which inhibition promotes activation in limbic circuits to drive male mating.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Across species, cooperative behaviors are often organized by distinct social roles such as leaders and followers, yet the neural mechanisms supporting such role-based coordination remain elusive. Here we introduce a new paradigm for studying cooperation in mice, where pairs of animals engage in a joint spatial foraging task that naturally gives rise to stable leader-follower roles predictive of learning speed. Disruption of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity, particularly in followers, impairs cooperation and induces reciprocal shifts in how animals weigh self- and partner-related cues for decision-making. Calcium imaging reveals that mPFC encodes both leadership dynamics and an egocentric social value map of the partner's position, each in an asymmetric, role-specific manner. Combining this behavior with a novel multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning framework, we identify latent value functions that guide cooperative decisions and are decodable from mPFC activity. These findings uncover fundamental neural computations that support cooperation, revealing how social roles shape decision-making in real time.

Yet it remains unclear whether social position reflects a single behavioral axis or arises from multiple, dissociable processes, and to what extent social structures are shaped by stable traits of the individuals or by emergent group dynamics. Addressing these questions in mice requires continuous, long-term tracking of multiple behaviors of individuals in unperturbed groups of sufficient size. To this end, we developed the NoSeMaze, a high-throughput, non-invasive sensor-rich habitat enabling scalable study of naturalistic social interactions. Spontaneous dyadic tube competitions revealed stable, transitive social hierarchies, with individual ranks persisting even after group reshuffling. Similarly, proactive chasing showed strong, trait-like stability across different social contexts. However, social status was not monolithic: rank and chasing were only moderately aligned. Their relationship was stronger in groups with less clarified hierarchies, where mice relied more on aggressive signaling to assert their position. Additionally, chasing was disproportionately concentrated among top-ranking individuals, suggesting active status negotiation within the social elite. Despite its stability, chasing thus fulfilled distinct functional roles depending on social context. Our findings support a systems-level view in which social position results from the interplay between stable individual traits and group-level dynamics. The modular NoSeMaze platform thereby reveals the multidimensional nature of social rank organization in mice.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Spatial patterns of gene expression predicted timescale variation at a resolution finer than brain-area boundaries. Across neurons, the diversity of timescales revealed a multiscale architecture, in which fast timescales determined regional differences in medians, while slow timescales universally followed a power-law distribution with an exponent near 2, indicating a shared dynamical regime across the brain consistent with the edge of instability or chaos.

While effective for controlling error rates at the cluster-level, cluster-based inference comes with a significant limitation: by shifting the focus of inference from individual time points to clusters, it prevents drawing conclusions about the precise onset or offset of observed effects. Here, we present a *model-based* alternative for analysing M/EEG timeseries, such as event-related potentials or time-resolved decoding accuracy. Our approach leverages Bayesian generalised additive multilevel models, providing posterior odds that an effect exceeds zero (or chance) at each time point, while naturally accounting for temporal dependencies and between-subject variability. Using both simulated and empirical M/EEG datasets, we show that this approach substantially outperforms conventional methods in estimating the onset and offset of neural effects, yielding more precise and reliable estimates.

Additionally, we correlate these findings to activity of the LA circuitry in vivo, using Neuropixels recordings in awake mice. In preweaning juveniles, the effects of ELS were remarkably similar in males and females, involving reduced IN excitability, elevated glutamatergic input to INs and shift in the PN E/I balance. While IN function was largely normalized in adult females, males developed a distinct pathological phenotype characterized by reduced glutamatergic input to INs, impaired recruitment of INs and hyperexcitability of PNs. This male-specific dysfunction correlated with aberrant LA oscillatory dynamics in awake mice and deficits in fear processing. Our data suggest that the impaired glutamatergic wiring of interneurons is a key mechanism underlying the aberrant circuit dynamics in the LA after ELS exposure and contribute to the ELS-induced defects in fear processing.

We compare single neuron and population encoding to null models expected for random integration and extraction of pure categorical single neuron representation. Using both univariate and multivariate regression techniques, we consistently noted that tuning for hue and luminance, rather than clustering into categorical response structures, formed uniform distributions. While the distribution of single neuron selectivity varied across the thalamocortical circuit, we found no evidence of categorical tuning organization emerging in the hierarchy. Nevertheless, populations contained complete information, in either high-dimensional linear representations or low-dimensional non-linear representations.

Genome-wide screening revealed that candidate genes were significantly enriched in categories related to mRNA metabolic processes and autophagy. Among them, we focused on the RNA-binding protein G3BP1, which is functionally associated with both processes. Detailed analyses showed that G3BP1 deficiency promoted the accumulation of Tau aggregates without affecting stress granule formation or autophagic flux. Instead, G3BP1 dysfunction resulted in impaired lysosomal homeostasis, as evidenced by reduced lysosomal abundance and acidification. Furthermore, lysosomal damage induced by LLOMe enhanced Tau aggregation, particularly in G3BP1-deficient cells. Conversely, pharmacological activation of TFEB by the curcumin analog C1 restored lysosomal function and suppressed Tau aggregate accumulation to wild-type levels. These findings highlight a role of G3BP1 in maintaining lysosomal homeostasis and promoting Tau clearance. Our results further suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing lysosomal biogenesis, such as TFEB activation, may hold promise for the treatment of tauopathies.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

We further examined the result for ray-finned fish by modelling species-accumulation curve asymptotes which supported this result. However, significant primer bias and amplification inconsistencies were observed, particularly in amphibian detections, and a high proportion of OTUs could not be resolved to species level due to taxonomic gaps in reference databases. We demonstrate, using species accumulation curves of our eDNA data and inventoried taxa lists of the MFPA, that the widespread practice of considering only resolved OTUs, rather than all unresolved OTUs, significantly underestimates biodiversity. This study underscores both the promise and current limitations of eDNA as a tool for tropical biodiversity assessment, specifically when compared to conventional sampling techniques.

Using experimentally evolved specialist and generalist lineages, we found that dispersal depends more on the context in which cues are encountered that on the kairomones themselves. Host specialisation strongly shaped responses: mites left plants more readily when exposed to unfamiliar hosts, with generalists dispersing over twice as often as specialists. Increased number of unfamiliar kairomones strongly inhibited generalists dispersal but barely affected specialists.

I build upon a spatially-explicit phenotypic model that I have previously presented. The model incorporates both phenotypic sorting and gene swamping, and is used to study either constant advective dispersal or trait-based habitat choice. Through analytical arguments on characteristic lengths and speeds, as well as by direct numerical solutions, I find that, in eco-evo scenarios, advective dispersal has two opposing effects on pulled invasion fronts. In shallow environmental gradients, the demographic effect of simply adding to the steady-state invasion speed dominates. As gradients get steeper, asymmetric gene flow, due to advective dispersal, becomes increasingly stronger, pulling the invasion front in an opposite direction. Steep gradients cause front reversals, where species ranges, counter-intuitively, slide upstream. Symmetry between velocity of advective dispersal and velocity of climate change leads to adaptation lags, abundance profiles, and invasion speeds that depend only on the velocity difference. Through characteristic lengths and speeds, I also identify a symmetry between demographic and evolutionary averaging or tracking of environmental heterogeneity. I connect climate change research to demographic models of persistence in advective environments -- the so-called drift paradox. I additionally derive several dimensionless ratios that have potential in facilitating comparisons among different species, traits and locales, and in guiding micro- and mesocosm experiments and space-for-time substitutions.

Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are promising early biomarkers of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. This study investigates dynamics of flavoprotein fluorescence (FPF), a non-invasive mitochondrial oxidative stress measure, and sensitivity to early neurodegeneration and neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo. Methods: FPF activity in response to neurodegeneration and neuroprotection were characterized in vitro in wild-type (WT) and SARM1 knockout (SARMKO) human embryonic stem cell-derived RGCs with and without Vacor treatment over 24 hours and confirmed with mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) measures. Further FPF evaluation was explored in vivo using the optic nerve crush (ONC) model in WT and SARMKO mice to compare early RGC stress detection within rodent retinas. Results: In vitro FPF intensities in WT RGCs increased within 8 hours of degeneration induction, preceding significant mitochondrial ROS production. Neuroprotective SARMKO RGCs maintained comparable FPF and ROS levels following insult. In vivo FPF changes were not observed in WT and SARMKO mice over 4 days following ONC, while only early retinal thickening was observed from OCT. Early FPF and OCT changes were not reflective of late RGC survival observed from ex vivo RGC soma and axon counts. Conclusions: These findings highlight differences in FPF sensitivity to mitochondrial stress between simplified in vitro systems and complex in vivo rodent retinas. This study demonstrates the potential of FPF as an early neurodegeneration and neuroprotection endpoint in vitro while identifying limitations and areas of development for its translatability to preclinical in vivo assessment.

Yet, the molecular basis of this resistance, beyond affecting transactivation of BCL-2 family genes, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that VenAza treatment leads to reduced transcriptional upregulation of the p53 signaling pathway in TP53 mutant/deficient AML compared to wild-type AML. Functionally, TP53 mutant/deficient AML exhibits selective failure in apoptosis induction rather than impaired G1 arrest or senescence. Despite inhibition of pro-apoptotic BAX and selective enrichment for MCL-1 in TP53 mutant isogenic AML cells, compensatory upregulation of BIM preserved functional mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). TP53 mutant primary AML tumors at baseline also had retained capacity for MOMP. Instead, TP53 mutant AML exhibited disruption in caspase-3/7 activation to evade apoptosis after VenAza therapy, decoupling the mitochondrial and executioner phases of apoptosis. Importantly, this (post-MOMP brake) is not a bystander effect but itself a driver of VenAza and chemotherapy resistance in TP53 mutant/deficient AML. This previously unrecognized mechanistic insight shifts the focus from mitochondrial priming to terminal caspase blockade in TP53 mutant AML and opens the door for urgently needed therapeutic strategies that reignite apoptosis at its execution point.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

This task disentangles motor action (Go or NoGo) from outcome valence (escape from, or avoidance of, an aversive stimulus), enabling the isolation of Pavlovian biases from instrumental learning processes. We compared multiple computational models that had previously been proposed to explain Pavlovian tendencies, including reinforcement learning, active inference, and drift diffusion-based approaches. We employed a hierarchical Bayesian inference procedure that treats model identity as a random factor at the individual level, allowing an unbiased determination of which mechanisms most accurately captured participants behavior. Across both datasets, models featuring Pavlovian context biases plus a value-decay mechanism best accounted for performance. By contrast, policy-based Pavlovian models and more complex approaches, such as those integrating working memory or active inference, were supported by fewer study participants.

Chronic SCD pain is commonly managed with opioid-based drugs that are associated with unwanted side effects, incomplete pain relief, and, in this population, accessibility issues. Thus, new treatments for chronic SCD pain are desperately needed. Here, we examined the analgesic efficacy of acute minocycline treatment in transgenic SCD mice. SCD mice exhibit gut dysbiosis and chronic inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that minocycline would provide robust analgesia in this model given the antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drug. Six days of minocycline treatment reversed chronic mechanical hypersensitivity only in male SCD mice. We identified two potential mechanisms underlying these sex-specific effects. First, we observed increased microgliosis only in the dorsal horn of male SCD mice. Minocycline treatment had opposite effects on microglial number in male and female SCD spinal cords. Second, minocycline treatment altered the gut microbiota in a sex-specific fashion; fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) from minocycline-treated female SCD mice induced widespread pain in recipients whereas FMT from minocycline-treated male SCD mice did not. In summary, these experiments highlight novel sex-specific mechanisms of minocycline analgesia and support future exploration of minocycline use for SCD pain management, but only in male patients.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Among these models, biophysically inspired neural mass models have been widely used to simulate electrophysiological recordings, such as MEG and EEG. However, traditional models face limitations, including susceptibility to hyperexcitation, which constrains their ability to capture the full richness of neural dynamics. Here, we developed and characterized a new version of the Jansen-Rit neural mass model aimed at overcoming these limitations. Our model incorporates inhibitory synaptic plasticity (ISP), which adjusts inhibitory feedback onto pyramidal neurons to clamp their firing rates around a target value. Further, the model combined two subpopulations of neural cortical columns oscillating in  and {gamma}, respectively, to generate a richer EEG power spectrum. We analyzed how different model parameters modulate oscillatory frequency and connectivity. We considered a models showcase, simultaneously fitting EEG and fMRI recordings during NREM sleep. Bifurcation analysis showed that ISP increases the parameters range in which the model exhibited sustained oscillations; the target firing rate acts as a bifurcation parameter, moving the system across the bifurcation point, producing different oscillatory regimes, from slower to faster. High frequency activity emerged from low global coupling, high firing rates, and a high proportion of {gamma} versus  subpopulations. Importantly, ISP was necessary in the multi-frequency model to successfully fit EEG functional connectivity across frequency bands. Finally, ISP-controlled reductions in excitability reproduced both the slow-wave activity and the reduced connectivity in NREM sleep. Altogether, our model is compatible with biological evidence of the effects of E/I balance on modulating brain rhythms and connectivity, as observed in sleep, neurodegeneration, and chemical neuromodulation. This biophysical model with ISP provides a springboard for realistic brain simulations in health and disease.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Classical balance mechanisms require strong external inputs to sustain finite firing rates, raising concerns about their biological plausibility. Here, we investigate an alternative mechanism based on short-term synaptic depression (STD) acting on excitatory-excitatory synapses, which dynamically balances the network activity without the need of external inputs. By employing accurate numerical simulations and theoretical investigations we characterize the dynamics of a massively coupled network made up of N rate-neuron models. Depending on the synaptic strength J0, the network exhibits two distinct regimes: at sufficiently small J0, it converges to a homogeneous fixed point, while for sufficiently large J0, it exhibits Rate Chaos. For finite networks, we observe several different routes to chaos depending on the network realization. The width of the transition region separating the homogeneous stable solution from Rate Chaos appears to shrink for increasing N and eventually to vanish in the thermodynamic limit (N [-&gt;] {infty}). The characterization of the Rate Chaos regime performed by employing Dynamical Mean Field (DMF) approaches allow us on one side to confirm that this novel balancing mechanism is able to sustain finite irregular activity even in the thermodynamic limit, and on the other side to reveal that the balancing occurs via dynamic cancellation of the input correlations generated by the massive coupling. Our findings show that STD provides an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism for balanced networks, sustaining irregular yet stable activity without the need of biologically unrealistic inputs. This work extends the balanced network paradigm, offering insights into how cortical circuits could maintain robust dynamics via synaptic adaptation.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used connectome-based predictive modelling (CPM) to find a linear relationship between task-based connectomes, taken from tasks that involved similar handgrip manipulations, and a separate measure of frailty: the maximum grip strength in older adults. We observed that the task-based connectomes were able to explain individual differences in grip strength, with the Subcortical and Cerebellum network, particularly the caudate nucleus, functional connectivity being the strongest predictor.

While IMs have been implicated in the control of acute Mtb infection, their role during latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has not yet been explored. We hypothesized that IMs contribute to maintaining latency and that their depletion during LTBI would promote Mtb reactivation, leading to TB relapse and disease. To test this, we utilized our previously established mouse model of paucibacillary Mtb infection that mimics aspects of LTBI in humans to selectively deplete IMs during the latent phase. IM depletion led to TB relapse in 26% of mice compared to 2% in control mice. The transitory depletion of this macrophage subset transiently affected both pulmonary macrophage and neutrophil populations. Mice that relapsed exhibited an increased proportion of pro-inflammatory IMs and elevated concentrations of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL3, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A and KC in the lung.

B.; Li, C.; De Smet, J.; Tomberlin, J.

On the one hand, mating is not necessarily deterministic of fertile eggs being produced, since females might lay unfertile eggs both before and after mating. But conversely, the process is not 'random' either, since fertility is predicated on the exchange of gametes during mating. To investigate the relationship between mating and other reproductive metrics, a cross-correlation analysis between lagged time series was conducted on data previously collected during a semi-outdoor greenhouse experiment. This process compared the average percent correlation between un-lagged mating with oviposition in traps, oviposition outside traps, total weight of eggs deposited, and hatch rate, which were lagged 0 to - 6 days. This revealed that average mating was 97.54% correlated with oviposition in traps lagged by - 2 days. For oviposition outside of traps, total egg weights, and hatch rate, these were also ~71.63% correlated, 60.29% correlated, and 75.16% correlated with mating respectively, which were optimized when the time series were lagged n = - 3 days. These trends likely have a biological basis since flies decrease their reproductive activity as they expend energy and senesce, aligning with temporal patterns consistently observed during BSF rearing.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Our results highlight the model's ability to generalize to diverse populations in the CARTaGENE and Montreal Heart Institute biobanks and that predictions remain robust to high levels of missing SNPs. We show that, despite the lack of North African populations in the training dataset, the model learns latent representations that reflect meaningful population structure for North African individuals in the biobanks. To improve model transparency, we apply Saliency Maps, DeepLift, GradientShap and Integrated Gradients attribution techniques and evaluate their performance in identifying SNPs leveraged by the model. Using DeepLift, we show that model's predictions are driven by population-specific signals consistent with those identified by traditional population genetics metrics.

While HGT has increasingly been documented in animals, the interaction of HGT with other mechanisms of novel gene formation is less well understood. We hypothesized that fusion with endogenous sequences in animal genomes might generate what we call \"HGT-chimeras\": genes with regions of non-metazoan and metazoan descent in the same open reading frame. To test this hypothesis, we developed a molecular phylogenetics pipeline that enables the identification of HGT-chimeras. We applied our pipeline to 319 high-quality annotated arthropod genomes and uncovered a high-confidence set of 274 HGT-chimeras corresponding to 104 independent origination events across diverse arthropods. HGT-chimeras contain intervals acquired from across the tree of life, and many likely originated via a gene duplication-based mechanism. To assess whether HGT-chimeras might be functionally important, we performed RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing of tissues from 19 arthropod species predicted to harbor HGT-chimeras in their genome. We found evidence of the expression of contiguous chimeric mRNAs for 33 of 37 tested HGT-chimeras across 17 of 19 different tested species. We also found evidence that HGT chimeras evolve under purifying selection and have acquired potentially functional domain architectures, consistent with the hypothesis that these genes are in active use and may participate in diverse biological processes.

To test this, we interleaved temporal reproduction and bisection tasks using a post-cue design that held duration encoding constant while varying motor output across trials. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we dissociated perceptual (stimulus-driven) and decisional (response-driven) components of serial dependence. With consecutive same tasks, we replicated repulsive perceptual serial dependence and attractive decisional carryover. Critically, these effects vanished across tasks, despite identical stimulus processing, suggesting that consistent motor responses, not shared memory alone, drive sequential biases. Moreover, SEM uncovered repulsive perceptual influences that standard regression missed, highlighting its power to isolate overlapping effects.

Using a discovery dataset (OASIS-3, n = 1032), we trained models on healthy control (HC), subsamples ranging from 5 to 600 individuals, while varying age and sex distributions to simulate biases in reference populations. We further assessed the use of adaptive transfer learning by pre-training models on the UK Biobank (n = 42,747) and adapting them to the clinical dataset applying the same sub-sampling strategies. We evaluated model performance on a fixed HC test set and quantified deviation score errors, outlier detection, and classification accuracy in both the HC test set and the AD cohort. The findings were replicated in an external validation sample (AIBL, n = 463). Across all settings, model performance improved with increasing sample size, but demographic alignment of the covariates, particularly in age, was essential for reliable deviation estimates. Models trained directly within the dataset achieved stable fit with approximately 200 HCs, while adapted models reached comparable performance with as few as 50 individuals when pre-trained on large-scale data.

Over a hundred genes are currently linked to CMT with enrichment for activities in myelination, axon transport, and protein synthesis. Mutations in tRNA synthetases cause dominantly inherited forms of CMT and animal models with CMT-linked mutations in these enzymes display defects in neuronal protein synthesis. Rescuing protein synthesis in CMT mutant neurons could offer exciting therapeutic options beyond symptom management. To address this need, we expressed CMT-linked variants in tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (YARS-CMT) in primary sensory neurons and evaluated impacts on protein synthesis and cell viability. YARS-CMT expression reduced protein synthesis in these neurons prior to the onset of caspase-dependent axon degeneration and cell death. To determine how YARS-CMT expression affects axon outgrowth, we dissociated and replated these neurons to stimulate axon regeneration. To our surprise, axonal regrowth occurred normally in replated YARS-CMT neurons. Moreover, replating YARS-CMT neurons rescued protein synthesis. Inhibiting mTOR suppressed rescue of protein synthesis after replating, consistent with its significant role in protein synthesis during axon regeneration. These discoveries identify new avenues for augmenting protein synthesis in diseased neurons and restoring protein synthesis in CMT or other neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

We assessed hourly calling activity of Boana pulchella in Uruguay over a 12-month period using Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) and validated semi-automated data processing methods to examine environmental drivers in a subtropical permanent pond. Calling behavior increased during the warmer months, showing a clear seasonal pattern. Peak activity timing remained consistent across seasons, but the temporal window of vocalizations expanded during winter (long nights) and contracted during summer (long days), reflecting photoperiodic variation. Linear regression analyses showed significant effects of photoperiod, temperature and their interaction on calling activity, while rainfall and atmospheric pressure showed no effect.

Current pharmacological interventions often focus on alleviating symptoms, but they rarely address the underlying neurobiological disruptions or have sustained therapeutic effects. Aims: The present study explores the therapeutic effect of Nigella sativa (black cumin) extract in a propionic acid (PPA)-induced wistar rat model of ASD. Methods: Forty male Wistar rats (n = 10 per group) were randomly assigned to four experimental groups, including control, PPA, N. sativa Low-Dose (NSL), and N. sativa High-Dose (NSH). The control group received daily intravenous (i.v.) injections (1 mL/kg) of saline (0.9% NaCl) over five days. The PPA group received daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 250 mg/Kg PPA for five days to induce ASD-like behaviors. NSL and NSH groups received N. sativa extract (10 mg/Kg and 50 mg/Kg, respectively) orally for 28 days, starting 7 days before PPA administration. Behavioral assessments, including social interaction, stereotypic behaviors, and anxiety, were conducted on day 28. Then, biochemical analyses (i.e., oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, neurotransmitter levels, caspase-3 expression, and histopathology) were performed. Results: The PPA group showed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced social interaction and increased stereotypic behaviors and heightened anxiety-like responses, indicative of ASD-like symptoms. Treatment with N. sativa resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in social behaviors, a reduction in stereotypic behaviors, and a decrease in anxiety-like responses. Biochemical analysis revealed that N. sativa treatment significantly (p < 0.05) reduced oxidative stress, evidenced by lower MDA levels, higher GSH, and restored SOD activity. In both NSL and NSH groups, it was observed that (i) inflammatory cytokines (i.e., TNF- and IL-1{beta}) were significantly (p < 0.05), (ii) neurotransmitter levels (i.e., dopamine and serotonin) were normalized, (iii) caspase-3 expression was significantly reduced, leading to a reduction in neuronal apoptosis-induced cell death, and (iv) histopathological analysis revealed reduced neuronal damages and a glial activation. Conclusions:N. sativa extract appears highly effective in ameliorating ASD behavioral and biochemical pathology abnormalities associated with ASD in a PPA-rat model. These results underscore the role of N. sativa for the treatment of ASD, including as possible adjunctive therapeutic option for this challenging neurodevelopmental disorder, though further research studies are necessary, including to determine the key phytochemical(s) involved in such beneficial effects.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Here, we explored the use of lyophilization combined with various cryoprotectants to enhance the long-term stability and reconstitution of DNA-SWCNTs at room temperature. Five conventionally used cryoprotectants, including glucose, sucrose, mannitol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), were evaluated for their ability to maintain desired optical properties and prevent aggregation of SWCNTs through the process of lyophilization and reconstitution. Our results indicated that glucose and PEG, particularly in an 80:20 ratio by weight, provided the best performance, preserving NIR fluorescence and ensuring consistent reconstitution without significant aggregation. Further, in vitro studies using murine macrophages demonstrated that lyophilized SWCNTs with glucose-PEG protectants and then held at room temperature before subsequent reconstitution maintained stable intracellular optical performance, supporting their potential for long-term storage, ease of transport, and use in biomedical applications.

Genetic ablation of Sox10 in the luminal compartment of MMTV-Neu (NIC) mice resulted in delayed but normal mammary gland development. Sox10 deletion conferred a dose-dependent delay in tumor onset, with a complete loss of tumor initiation in Sox10-deficient luminal cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Sox10 inactivation in Neu-transformed tumor cells led to reduced 3D invasion and diminished self-renewal in mammosphere assays. Established Sox10-null cell lines exhibited markedly impaired growth in orthotopic transplant models and failed to colonize lung tissue following tail vein injection, suggesting a loss of tumor-initiating capacity. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that Sox10-deficiency in Neu+ tumor cells induces a luminal-to-basal/stem-like shift and the downregulation of several genes associated with genetic networks regulating stemness. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Sox10 is required for a permissive cell progenitor state for Neu-driven tumor initiation and that it is critical to sustain the invasive and self-renewing traits that drive tumor progression and metastasis.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

E.; Zhan, F.; Pons, C.; Schwartz, T. H.", "abstract": "Seizures propagate through the brain either locally or via widespread networks of anatomically and functionally connected nodes. These sites can be manipulated in the surgical treatment of human patients through ablation or stimulation. However, we still lack a full understanding of how seizures, ablation, and stimulation recruit or alter recruitment of these distant sites. Here, we apply widefield calcium imaging in a non-anesthetized rodent multi-nodal bilateral neocortical network model of focal epilepsy to examine excitatory and inhibitory cell recruitment. When we initiate seizures in somatosensory cortex (S1), they preferentially spread to an ipsilateral node in frontal cortex (M2) rather than across the corpus callosum to contralateral mirror somatosensory cortex. On the other hand, seizures rapidly spread across the corpus callosum in regions that connect M2 with its mirror M2 focus, indicating that this frontal region acts an amplifier for secondary generalization. Accordingly, ablation of M2 radically altered seizure propagation. Electrical stimulation of S1 revealed that S1 preferentially recruits excitatory cells in ipsilateral M2 but inhibitory cells in contralateral S1, which may explain the preferred propagation pathway. We also observed that the stimulation frequency can differentially determine the response of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons. Altogether, our findings suggest that seizures do not propagate homogeneously through anatomically connected nodes but are preferentially pulled to specific locations by excitatory/inhibitory balance. Thus, functional connectivity rather than anatomic connectivity will be more predictive of ictal spread, and more informative for ablative and stimulation-based therapeutics.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

However, peptides of the gut-brain axis appear to offer promising therapeutic targets for AUD as they influence the mesolimbic reward circuitry. Here, we examined the effects of tirzepatide, a long-acting dual glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) agonist approved for diabetes and obesity, using behavioral assays, alcohol intake paradigms, and molecular analyses in rodents. First, tirzepatide effectively attenuated the rewarding properties of alcohol, measured through locomotor stimulation, conditioned place preference, and accumbal dopamine release. Subsequently, this GLP-1R/GIPR agonist dose-dependently reduced voluntary alcohol consumption, prevented binge and relapse-like drinking, and maintained efficacy during repeated administration. Finally, tirzepatide induced sustained synaptic depression in the lateral septum and further altered histone regulatory proteins in this region, suggesting a potential neural substrate for its effects. Moreover, the GLP-1R/GIPR agonist affected metabolic parameters including body weight, adipose tissue mass, hepatic triglycerides and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, our findings suggest tirzepatide modulates alcohol-related behaviors through reward-related mechanisms while also affecting physiological consequences associated with long-term alcohol use. Given tirzepatide's established clinical use and the consistency of effects observed here, these results support further investigation for treating AUD and associated complications.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

These changes include morphological differences in the size and shape of brain regions, but little is known about plasticity within individual neurons and alterations in behavior not directly related to aggregation or swarming. We examined looming escape behavior and the properties of a well-studied collision-detection neuron in gregarious and solitarious animals of three closely related species, the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria), the Central American locust (S. piceifrons) and the American bird grasshopper (S. americana). For this neuron, the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD), we examined dendritic morphology, membrane properties, gene expression, and looming responses. Gregarious animals reliably jumped in response to looming stimuli, but surprisingly solitarious desert locusts did not produce escape jumps. These solitarious animals also had smaller LGMD dendrites. This is the first study done on three different species of grasshoppers to observe the effects of phenotypic plasticity on the jump escape behavior, physiology and transcriptomics of these animals. Surprisingly, there were little differences in these properties between the two phases except for behavior. For all the three species, gregarious animals jumped more than solitarious animals, but no significant differences were found between the two phases of animals in the electrophysiological and transcriptomics studies. Our results suggest that phase change impacts mainly the motor system and that the physiological properties of motor neurons need to be characterized to understand fully the variation in jump escape behavior across phases.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Six healthy volunteers underwent whole-body PET/CT imaging over 5.5 hours following intravenous injection of 7-[18F]FTrp. An additional four subjects underwent dynamic brain PET imaging for 2 hours. Time-activity curves (TACs) were extracted for source organs using VOIs defined on co-registered CT and PET images, and dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA software.

Recent studies have identified a critical role for Rorgt expressing antigen-presenting cells (APC), Thetis cells (TCs), in peripheral regulatory T (pTreg) cell differentiation and tolerance to food and commensal microbes. TCs encompass four distinct subsets, and a subset of TCs, TC IV induces pTreg differentiation, but the transcription factors that control their differentiation are not fully known. Here, using orthogonal genetic approaches to impair Runx/Cbfb activity, we show that development of specific TCs subsets is regulated by Runx/Cbfb transcriptional factor complexes. While attenuated Runx3 by germline mutations resulted in a severe reduction of all Rorgt+ APCs, mice lacking one of two Cbb splicing variants, Cbfb2, exhibited a loss of TC II, III and TC IV subsets with associated loss of Rorgt+ pTreg cells. Conditional inactivation of Runx1 and Runx3 genes by CD11c-Cre led to a specific loss of TC III and TC IV subsets. Strikingly, CD11c-Cre driven transgenic Runx expression, particularly Runx1, led to enhanced TC IV differentiation and thus Rorgt+ pTreg cells. Furthermore, transgenic Cbfb2 by CD11c-Cre recovered only TC IV subset with restoration of Rorg;t+ pTreg in Cbfb2-deficient mice.

We provide evidence for a biphasic regulatory program orchestrating larval and adult shell formation, involving the coordinated activity of ancient transcription factors and dynamic chromatin remodeling. Comparative analyses suggest a conserved developmental toolkit was co-opted for larval exoskeleton formation in the common lophotrochozoan ancestor. In contrast, limited regulatory conservation was observed between lophotrochozoans and echinoderms with regards to the formation of biomineralized skeletons, despite both relying on a heterochronic activation of ancestral regulators. Together, our findings support a hierarchical model where dynamic chromatin decouples rapidly evolving effectors from deeply conserved regulators, allowing modular innovations within conserved gene regulatory networks.

In this study, we established an analytical toolbox comprising scattering and fluorescence mode nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), fluorescence-based flow cytometry (Fl-FC), and multi-detector analytical size exclusion chromatography. Liposomes, selected for their physicochemical similarity to EVs, were used as reference materials to optimize assay parameters, fluorescence labeling conditions, and dynamic range, minimizing artifacts such as photobleaching and masking effects. Using these optimized analytical tools, we designed a scalable DSP workflow for human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell (hBM-MSC) derived EVs, incorporating clarification, tangential flow filtration (TFF), ion exchange chromatography (IEX), buffer exchange, and sterile filtration. IEX chromatography resulted in the elution of two cell-secreted populations, with similar scattering signals while eluate 1 showed approximately 30 times higher absorbance signal compared to eluate 2. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that eluate 1 contained non-vesicular extracellular particles (NVEPs), and eluate 2 was enriched in EVs and showed higher expression of positive markers such as CD81 and CD73 using Simple Western. Additionally, the two IEX eluates showed different proteomic and lipidomic profiles. Then the analytical toolbox was utilized to monitor the DSP process in terms of particle recovery and impurity removal throughout the process determining the high purity level of the final EV preparation.

While reference-based deconvolution approaches offer robust solutions, they rely heavily on the availability and quality of external single-cell reference data, which may be incomplete, unavailable, or poorly matched to the spatial data. Moreover, even when such references are available, they often represent only broad cell types, potentially obscuring finer subpopulation structures and masking intra-type heterogeneity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce gnSPADE, a reference-free spatial deconvolution method that incorporates gene network structures via a Markov random field within a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) modeling framework. gnSPADE jointly infers cell type-specific transcriptional profiles and spatial compositions without external references.

We systematically benchmark uniform sampling, leverage-score sampling, Geosketch (minimax/Hausdorff), and scSampler (maximin) across multiple real ST datasets (mouse ovary, MERFISH brain, human breast cancer, lung) and simulations, using three input representations: PCA embeddings, spatial coordinates, and spatially smoothed embeddings. We show that expression-only designs capture global transcriptomic heterogeneity but distort tissue architecture by over-sampling high-variability regions and under-sampling homogeneous areas. Coordinate-only sampling restores tissue coverage but misses transcriptional extremes. A simple spatially aware extension, computing leverage scores from a randomized SVD basis smoothed by a spatial weights matrix, strikes a favorable balance, recovering rare cell states while maintaining uniform tissue coverage and avoiding edge effects. Across robust Hausdorff distances, clustering stability (ARI), PCA loading drift, and local cell-type MSE, spatially smoothed leverage scores match or outperform alternatives.

While SIRT3 has been described as a tumor suppressor in some contexts and as a tumor promoter in others, its role appears to be tissue- and metabolism-specific.

Methods: We address this question by using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to identify neural states from chronic motor cortical and STN recordings in five PD patients (1,046 hours from 10 hemispheres), with concurrent measurements of bradykinesia using wearable sensors. Findings: We identified four neural states with distinct spectral and temporal features. Two states exhibited spectral signatures--particularly STN low and high gamma, STN delta/alpha, cortical beta, and cortico-STN beta coherence--that predicted worsening bradykinesia. However, STN beta power alone was not consistently predictive, challenging traditional beta-centric views. These states also displayed compensatory features associated with bradykinesia amelioration, including cortical delta/alpha activity, cortical high gamma, and cortico-STN high gamma coherence. Two additional states affected bradykinesia through temporal rather than spectral properties. Prolonged lifetimes of one of these state worsened symptoms, whereas increased occurrences of another, marked by local beta without cortico-STN beta coherence, improved motor function. Interpretation: Our findings highlight the multidimensional nature of bradykinesia and suggest that state-aware, adaptive interventions targeting state features--rather than single frequency bands--may offer new opportunities for improved deep brain stimulation in PD.

Thus, accurately characterizing the neural response to external signals is a crucial first step in understanding these networks, which conceivably could enable neuroscience and medical applications. In particular, kilohertz (kHz) neuronal electrical stimulation is a technique capable of inducing behaviors and drives unseen in more conventional lower frequency ranges. This fact could be used in the development of neuromodulation therapies for neurological pathologies, e.g., Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). Here, we investigate neuronal response and excitability of conductance-based models to kHz frequencies stimulation in a still unexplored parameter space region. We show that the dynamics exhibited by the paradigmatic Hodgkin-Huxley model under kilohertz stimulation is highly diverse, displaying from regular spiking to chaotic behavior, as well as regions of complete activity suppression. By extending the analyses to models of mammalian central nervous system regions we show that, despite presenting similar low-frequency dynamics, such neurons tend to respond rather differently under kilohertz. Further, based on dynamical markers, we propose a method for systematically mapping these behaviors on a stimulation parameter space. These results establish a quantitative framework for ultra-high-frequency neuromodulation protocols, paving the way for future computational neuroscience approaches to stimulation-based procedures.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

We have previously demonstrated that a substantial number of genes are rhythmically expressed in the mushroom body (MB) Kenyon cells (KCs), including Pka-C1, which encodes the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA-C1 plays a crucial role in promoting daytime wakefulness; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that the {gamma}-lobe is the primary site of rhythmic Pka-C1 expression using a newly developed in vivo luciferase reporter. Through a combination of in silico analysis, CRISPR mutagenesis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identify the transcription factor Onecut as a regulator of Pka-C1 transcriptional rhythms in {gamma}-KCs. Furthermore, genetic trans-synaptic connectivity mapping and neuronal activity imaging reveal that the dorsal Lateral clock Neurons (LNds) provide inhibitory input to a subset of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster, PAM-{gamma}5, rhythmically modulating their activity. This, in turn, rhythmically activates MB {gamma}-KCs via excitatory Dop1R signaling. Resulting {gamma}-neuron activity rhythms drive Pka-C1 transcriptional rhythms through Onecut. Furthermore, these PKA-C1 rhythms reinforce neuronal activity rhythms, creating a feedback cycle between transcriptional and neural activity rhythms that promote daytime wakefulness. Our findings highlight the conserved role of DA in promoting wakefulness and offer mechanistic insights into its complex regulation.

In addition, there is a high burden of neuritic Lewy pathology in the putamen, though the neuronal origin of this pathology is unclear. In the current study, we quantified the burden of Lewy pathology in the putamen across the spectrum of LBDs. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify the Lewy burden in the putamen, cingulate and frontal cortices of 9 controls and 24 LBD cases. Even in PD cases without dementia, we observed a nearly complete striatal dopaminergic denervation among LBDs. Consistent with this denervation, most -synuclein pathology did not co-localize with dopaminergic terminals, but was instead enriched in excitatory, VGLUT1-positive terminals. This enrichment in glutamatergic terminals was associated with swollen axons, but not with overall loss of VGLUT1 terminals. These findings suggest that Lewy pathology accumulates at excitatory corticostriatal synapses prior to overt synaptic degeneration and could contribute to cognitive decline in LBDs.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Distinct EML4-ALK variants cause different rates of disease progression, with patients expressing variant 3 (V3) exhibiting accelerated metastasis. Cells expressing EML4-ALK V3 develop a mesenchymal-like morphology and enhanced migration that is dependent on the NEK9 and NEK7 kinases. However, downstream substrates of these kinases relevant to these phenotypes are largely unknown. Here, we show that the actin-binding protein cortactin is phosphorylated by NEK7 within the F-actin-binding region (ABR) and that depletion of cortactin abrogates the morphological and migration phenotypes induced by EML4-ALK V3. Expression of constitutively active mutants of NEK9 or NEK7 causes similar cortactin-dependent morphological and migration changes. Cortactin co-localises with NEK7 and EML4-ALK V3 at branched filopodia-like extensions that are also generated upon expression of a cortactin protein with phospho-mimetic mutations in the ABR. In contrast, phospho-null mutations dissociate cortactin from F-actin. We propose that EML4-ALK V3 alters cell morphology and promotes directed cell migration by modulating the actin cytoskeleton via NEK7-mediated phosphorylation of cortactin within its ABR.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Despite the life-changing impact of anti-VEGF therapies, vascular retinopathies continue to affect millions of patients worldwide. To better understand disease progression, it is essential to define alternative mechanisms that contribute to retinal vascular dysregulation. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 plays a significant role in regulating vascular homeostasis, angiogenesis, and retinal disease progression, yet effective therapeutic targeting remains elusive. An alternative atypical p38 signaling pathway is mediated by interaction with the adaptor protein TGF-beta activated kinase 1, binding protein 1 (TAB1). Atypical p38 can be activated by ischemia or by inflammatory G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to regulate inflammation and vascular homeostasis. However, atypical signaling has not been investigated in the context of vascular retinopathies, specifically oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Here, we utilized a genetic knock-in mouse to block atypical p38 activity (Tab1KI) to explore retinal damage during OIR. We report that Tab1KI mice display significantly reduced vaso-obliteration and limited neovascularization relative to wild-type C57BL6 controls. Retinal RNAseq analysis revealed distinct transcriptional regulation in the Tab1KI mouse. Suppression of atypical p38 reduced Mef2c signaling, which in turn enhanced microglial activation and inflammation. Despite the upregulation of proangiogenic markers, the increase in endothelial markers does not correlate with the dysregulated growth of blood vessels. Instead, Mef2c suppression reduces pathological angiogenesis, while increasing physiological vascular regrowth. The combined data suggest that the selective inhibition of atypical p38 signaling could block the enhanced pathogenic neovascular tuft formation without impacting blood vessel repair. Further investigation will clarify how atypical p38 controls neovascular responses, potentially revealing new treatment strategies for vascular retinopathies.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Given that SNARE proteins are essential for downstream vesicle targeting and fusion events, their recruitment into nascent CCVs has been suggested to play a role in regulating CME progression. However, which and how SNARE proteins regulate CME remains to be explored. Here, we showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of the R-SNARE, VAMP8 impairs CCP initiation, stabilization and invagination and strongly inhibits CME. Mechanistically, recruitment of VAMP8 to CCVs is not required for CME regulation. Instead, VAMP8 regulates CME indirectly by mediating endocytic recycling. Depletion of VAMP8 skews endosomal recycling of CME cargo, exemplified here by transferrin receptor, toward lysosomal degradation, thereby inhibiting CCV formation. Overall, our study provides new insights into the crosstalk between endocytosis and VAMP8-mediated endocytic recycling of CME cargo and demonstrates the significance of cargo recruitment in CME regulation.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Ral GTPases have long been proposed as regulators of the metazoan Exocyst, a conserved secretory vesicle-tethering complex, but direct evidence for this role has been scarce. In contrast, the well-studied yeast Exocyst relies on multiple Rab GTPases to regulate function, but yeast do not encode Ral. Using Caenorhabditis elegans we demonstrate that endogenous RAL-1 directly engages the Exocyst through conserved binding sites in its subunits. Loss of RAL-1 disrupts dendritic arborization of PVD sensory neurons, impairs vesicle trafficking, and causes broad developmental defects, acting both cell-autonomously in neurons and non-autonomously through supporting epithelial cells. Structure-guided genome editing of RAL-1-Exocyst interfaces produced synthetic phenotypes, underscoring the physiological importance of these contacts. Taken together, our findings establish RAL-1 as a bona fide regulator of the metazoan Exocyst in vivo and suggest that Ral-Exocyst interactions operate in parallel with other secretory pathways.

While there have been efforts to understand the mechanism behind this pathophysiology, it largely remains unclear. Lack of preclinical animal models that recapitulate aberrant steroid hormone pathways in UL has significantly hampered the development of long-term hormonal therapies for uterine fibroids. In addition, cultured myometrial as well as leiomyoma smooth muscle cells rapidly silence both estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PGR) expression through unknown mechanisms, further limiting in vitro mechanistic studies of UL. Previous work by our lab has determined the loss of REST, a master regulator of epigenetic gene silencing, in leiomyoma results in the upregulation of ESR1 targets and therefore estrogen signaling. Using ChIP-PCR, we find REST is directly associated with ESR1 genomic locus, playing a role in its epigenetic regulation. ChIP-seq analysis of Rest cKO mouse uterus samples reveals a global role for REST in the regulation of progesterone receptor target genes and highlights alterations in PGR binding within the Esr1 locus. Additionally, we find REST inhibition of ESR1 expression is regulated through upstream WNT planar cell polarity molecule, PRICKLE1. Based on role of REST in silencing ESR1 expression in cultured myometrial cells, our results support the development of a potential cell culture method to maintain ESR1 expression through REST modulation.

Glioblastoma is the most common, aggressive, and lethal type of glioma. It is highly proliferative and invasive, infiltrates the surrounding brain parenchyma and is resistant to current treatments. Patients suffering from glioblastoma have a wide heterogeneity in life expectancy, even with similar mutations, that can vary from weeks to years. Many potential risk factors for glioma have been studied to date, but few provide significant correlations for tumor prognosis. Here, we provide a novel perspective on the interaction between the tumor and host depending on paternal environmental or lifestyle determinants, coined as Brain fitness hypothesis. Permanent light exposure induces genetic stress hallmarks in the progeny that do not alter central nervous system development, but compromise Brain fitness to an accelerated glioma growth, ultimately reducing life expectancy. Reduced survival in the progeny correlates with an increase in the number of activated brain genes involved in neuronal dynamics as well as those relevant for glioma progression such as presynaptic, circadian genes or genes required for the tumoral network. Among the inheritable mechanisms, ncRNAs emerge as potential vectors for the transmission of parental exposure to the subsequent generations and might explain the complexity of inheritable traits and phenotypes acquired as a pleiotropic effect.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

We analyzed standard BM biopsies from pediatric ALL patients. Sequential 5-color immunofluorescence (IF) staining with CD45, CD271, CD31, CD34 and DAPI was used to identify different BM cell types. Combined RNAscope and IF staining was established for spatial mRNA expression analysis of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and platelet-derived growth factor alpha 1 (PDGFA1), which are known to play major roles in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). PMF and normal BM samples served as controls. As expected, ALL bone marrows showed high cellularities and prominent populations of blast cells. CD271+ MSC density was increased in ALL and was associated with fibrosis in a similar manner as observed for PMF. TGFB1 and PDGFA1 expression was considerably increased in ALL megakaryocytes (MKs) compared to PMF patients and normal controls. Furthermore, MK TGFB1 and PDGFA1 expression intensities in fibrotic ALL correlated with fibrosis grade. TGFB1 and PDGFA1 were also expressed in leukemic blasts, however at lower intensities compared to ALL MKs. Taken together, advanced in-situ RNA and IF staining not only revealed increased expression of TGFB1 and PDGFA1 in fibrotic pediatric ALL, but also identified ALL blasts and MKs as their cellular origin at the single cell level.

The discovery that biosynthesis of type I collagen in fibrosis is regulated by binding of LARP6 to the unique sequence found in type I collagen mRNAs, the 5' stem-loop (5'SL), prompt the search for small molecule inhibitors of LARP6 binding. A contaminant in some commercial preparations of the third-generation cephalosporin, cefixime, has been discovered that inhibits LARP6/5'SL interaction in vitro and type I procollagen secretion by cells and organoids in culture. The activity, termed ATO-OA, forms stable non-colloidal nano-entities (NE). ATO-OA NE inhibit the binding of LARP6 to 5'SL with the IC50 of 3-4 g/ml and are equally effective in the dissociation of preassembled LARP6/5'SL complex as in the inhibition of its formation. ATO-OA NE target the RRM domain of LARP6 to alter its conformation. In cultured cells, ATO-OA NE suppresses type I procollagen secretion into the cellular medium and causes intracellular retention of the protein. The effect of ATO-OA NE in vivo is LARP6 dependent, because the LARP6 knockout cells or the cells which make type I procollagen without 5'SL show no effect of ATO-OA. In cultured organoids of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells ATO-OA NE diminished type I collagen production at ~62.5 g/ml.

More specifically, temperate bacteriophage Lambda ({lambda}) was engineered as a chassis to just-in-time amplify and deliver a production circuit to a wild-type Escherichia coli population. Since the expression of the production pathway is engineered to be dependent on {lambda}'s central regulatory switch towards the lysogenic state, {lambda} will first lytically amplify in the background without significantly altering overall bioreactor growth dynamics or gene expression. Only when {lambda} eventually starts outnumbering the host population, its natural switch to lysogeny will actively install and trigger the production circuit.

C.", "abstract": "Background: Diarrheal diseases remain a major global health burden, as they severely affect children, particularly in Bangladesh. After decades of research, the molecular mechanisms of diarrheal pathogens for disease pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance are still unknown, notably in Gram-negative bacteria. This pilot study fills the gap by employing whole genome sequencing and pan-genome analysis to analyze Bangladeshi diarrheal pathogens to identify genetic variables that cause disease pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance. Results: Hence, we investigated the genetic diversity of bacterial isolates from 31 clinical stool samples by a combination of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and pan-genomic analysis. A core group of 50 genes, conserved across a significant number of strains, was identified via pan-genomic analysis, with considerable variation in accessory genes. This signifies a significant degree of genetic flexibility. Gene ontology analysis yielded substantial insights into prospective therapeutic targets by emphasizing the critical function of these core genes in bacterial survival and pathogenicity. Furthermore, the findings of the antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) revealed concerning resistance trends, particularly to fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams, underscoring the necessity for enhanced surveillance and alternative therapeutic approaches. Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive genetic framework to improve understanding of the complexity of diarrheal infections and the mechanisms underlying their resistance, fostering opportunities for potential therapeutic advancements.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

As viral pathogens typically employ double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), host identification, modulation, and response to dsRNA is key. However, dsRNA is also abundant in host transcriptomes, raising the question of how these molecules can be differentiated. Two host pathways that regulate dsRNA are A-to-I RNA editing by adenosine deaminases (ADARs), and RNA interference (RNAi). Both mechanisms are important for normal organism development and function by regulating gene expression. Herein, we studied the structure and amount of siRNAs at editing sites and the ability of ADARs to prevent exogenous RNAi using the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that the number of siRNAs targeting edited genes is significantly upregulated in ADAR mutant animals. We also found that despite an almost complete depletion of primary siRNAs generated from editing sites in wildtype animals, secondary siRNAs are generated from edited transcripts, suggesting ADARs antagonize only the first step of RNAi processing. We show that ADARs interfere with the efficacy of exogenous RNAi in vivo, probably to prevent trans-silencing, and have indications that ADR-2 binding to the dsRNA is needed for the efficient prevention of RNAi. This work sheds light on how the RNA editing process protects self-produced dsRNAs from aberrant recognition by the immune processes in the cell and from by-product degradation.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Here, they are integrated to solve the time to fixation unconditional on fixation in a Wright-Fisher model with recurrent mutation, drift and selection. In its derivation, minor improvements to the probability of fixation and the probability distributions of emergence and spread (or passage) are made. The solution is an exponentially modified Gaussian (ex-Gaussian) distribution with a mean and variance that is the sum of the mean and variance of the underlying exponential and normal (i.e. Gaussian) distributions. To demonstrate its value as a synoptic solution to the Wright-Fisher model, the ex-Gaussian distribution is used to partition the effects of the evolutionary forces of mutation, drift, selection and (to some extent) migration on chosen points of the probability distribution of fixation times. Further, the solution is used to derive (and show the quantitative meaning of) the stochastic drift barrier to nearly neutral mutations with very low selection coefficients, and its consequences on the probability distribution of phenotypic and/or fitness effects that contribute to adaptation. In this way, the probability distribution of the time to fixation unconditional on fixation provides an elegant summary of some key results from classical population genetics, and is also likely to have many other theoretical and applied uses.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

However, how such robustness emerges through evolution, and how it relates to the underlying sequence-structure map, remains poorly understood. In contrast, the mutational profiles (distribution of structures upon point mutation) of RNA secondary structures are well characterised, exhibiting both high mutational robustness and high evolvability through mutational access to diverse folds. The recent revolution in protein structure prediction now enables analagous large-scale analyses for proteins. Here, we use the structure prediction algorithm ESMFold to systematically investigate the mutational profiles of natural, random, and de novo proteins. Unlike RNA, where functional and random sequences share similar mutational profiles, natural proteins are substantially more robust than random amino acid sequences, suggesting an evolutionary drive toward robustness. They also exhibit limited structural variation among close sequence neighbours, potentially constraining access to new folds. Interestingly, many de novo proteins do resemble random sequences in their mutational profiles, with low robustness relative to established proteins. These findings reveal how gene duplication and de novo gene birth follow distinct evolutionary trajectories toward functional proteins and highlight a potential role for large-effect mutations in the emergence of structural complexity.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Using deep PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing, combined with reference-guided scaffolding based on near-complete C. speciosa genome, we generated assemblies of 259.1 Mbp (C. itosakura) and 312.6 Mbp (C. jamasakura), with both >98% BUSCO completeness. Consistent with their natural histories, C. itosakura showed low heterozygosity, while C. jamasakura displayed high genomic diversity. Comparative genomic analyses revealed structural variations, including large chromosomal inversions. Notably, the availability of both the previously published C. speciosa genome and our new C. itosakura genome enabled the reconstruction of proxy haplotypes for both parental lineages of 'Somei-yoshino'.

While bees possess innate collision avoidance reflexes, they may benefit from learning to identify and avoid high-risk collision areas using environmental cues. However, the temporal dynamics of how bees form associations between visual cues and collision experiences remain unclear. We investigated whether bumblebees associate visual cues perceived before or after collision events with a movement direction. Individual foragers were trained to navigate through a flight tunnel containing a transparent barrier and an LED panel that switched colours immediately after the bee's first collision. Following training, we tested bees' responses to each colour cue without the barrier. Bees demonstrated significant preferences for avoiding the previously blocked side when presented with either the pre-collision colour (81% correct responses) or post-collision colour (71% correct responses), while showing no preference when no colour cue was presented. Individual analysis revealed that 61% of bees responded to both cue types, while others showed selective responses to specific temporal windows. These results demonstrate that bees can form associations with visual cues encountered in different time windows relative to negative experiences, revealing temporal flexibility in associative learning that contributes to successful navigation in cluttered environments.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

The hypoxic microenvironment of tumors leads to metabolic reprogramming of cells, driving them towards more aggressive and treatment resistant state. To identify better targets for the effective removal of hypoxia adaptive cells, it is crucial to understand how these cells alter metabolism in hypoxic conditions. Methods We have used confocal microscopy to visualize mitochondrial morphology which confirmed hypoxia, and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to decipher lipid metabolic changes in iPSC-derived human glial progenitor cells induced by that hypoxia. Results Our findings revealed that hypoxia induced changes in mitochondrial morphology, interaction of mitochondria with lysosomes, and the expression of oxidized lipid species in iPSC-derived human glial progenitor cells. Hypoxic cells showed elongated mitochondria that resembled strings. MALDI-MSI based finger printing showed upregulation of oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (PE): m/z 716.484 PE(33:1)+O, m/z 730.01 PE(34:1)+O, m/z 766.497 PE(37:5)+O, m/z 768.510 PE(37:4)+O, and oxidized phosphatidylcholine (PC): m/z 742.500 PC(32:2)+O, m/z 744.513 PC(33:2)+O, m/z 770.531 PC(34:2)+O), m/z 794.534 PC(34:1)+O, m/z 888.523 PC(42:11)+OH, and oxidized phosphatidic acid (PA): m/z 673.444 PA(33:2)+O, m/z 699.466 PA(35:3)+OH, m/z 725.531 PA(37:4)+OH in hypoxic cells.

Polyanionic polysaccharides containing uronic acids (UA) in their structure are therefore often associated with psychrophilic-like traits, such as defense against cryoinjury. However, their practical biological post-thaw benefit is convoluted amongst other contributing factors, including hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance, molecular weight, rheological properties, and structural conformation. Here, we leveraged ubiquitous (31.7% m.d.w.) and COOH-targeted (63.4% m.d.w.) leaving-group SN2 tosylation procedures, coupled with clean purification methodologies (high-MW membrane dialysis), to synthesize UA-free variants (FP-OTs18, FP-OTs96) of the cryoprotective, UA-containing polysaccharide FucoPol (FP). Tosylation was confirmed by ATR-FTIR (1602.3 cm-1 shift to 1627.9 cm-1) and 1H-NMR (brs, {delta} 7.92 ppm; brs, 7.53 ppm). Tosylated derivatives exhibited reduced solution conductivity ({Omega} = 300 {micro}S/cm vs. {approx}800 {micro}S/cm), unchanged molecular weight (Mw), and retained biocompatibility. However, the substitution of hydrophilic, low-steric hindrance carboxyl groups with hydrophobic, high steric hindrance tosyl groups promoted a 30-40% reduction in zero-shear viscosity (0) and precluded the formation of a hypothermic gel-state due to loss of inter-chain non-covalent interactions, leading to a drastic loss of cryoprotective activity (10-70% of the original post-thaw viability observed for native FucoPol). The cryobiologically antagonistic effect of FP-OTs18 and FP-OTs96 reveals that UAs are a key player in polysaccharide-based cryopreservation, not only due to standalone beneficial polyanionicity, but also because their presence largely contributes to the expression of agonistic structural traits that elicit a cryoprotective response.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

They serve as ethical bridge approaches to human studies. However, these models need improvements in generating well-organized granuloma lesions, classic tuberculoma structures, and relevant microenvironments. They are impractical for screening extensive chemical and genetic libraries owing to their low throughput, limited scalability, batch-to-batch variability, and high costs.

However, it remains unclear how sequence variations could introduce or alter such catalytic mechanisms in myoglobin. Here we used enzyme proximity sequencing (EP-Seq) to measure the peroxidase activity levels of >6,000 human myoglobin variants.

The predictions suggested a beneficial role for hole-hopping mutations in improving peroxidase activity. We experimentally tested 20 high scoring variants in a yeast display assay, all of which outperformed wild type myoglobin. Three selected variants were also tested in soluble format and similarly showed improved performance. A focused combinatorial library yielded a top double tryptophan variant (Q92W/F107W) with 4.9-fold higher catalytic efficiency than wild type.

A stop codon is recognized as premature if it is followed by an exon-exon junction in >50 nucleotides downstream.

Here, we systematically examine exons that carry a PTC (poison exons) for the presence of polyadenylation sites (PAS) in the downstream intron. Using the GTEx consortium data, we found that poison exons are followed by an active PAS more frequently than cassette exons, and identified tissue-specific switches between NMD-target and NMD-escape isoforms in a number of human genes. Among them are the tropomyosin 2 (TPM2) gene switching between NMD-target and NMD-escape isoforms in skeletal muscle and heart, and the vaccinia-related kinase 3 (VRK3) with a similar kidney-specific switch. Blocking the polyadenylation signal and the cleavage site in VRK3 by antisense oligonucleotides in the A549 cell line led to a switch from NMD-escape to NMD-target isoform that was accompanied by a drop in the expression level. This study suggests that NMD escape via alternative polyadenylation could be a widespread and currently overlooked post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

The bio-based fucose-rich polysaccharide FucoPol, a current model under our scope of expertise, has further demonstrated crystal size reduction, thermal hysteresis, nucleation anticipation, nucleation stochastic narrowing and Gibbs-Thomson growth modulation effects, the latter similar to a type I antifreeze protein, in different thermodynamic settings: bulk vs. directional freezing; isobaric vs. isochoric systems; and sterile vs. biological media. Here, we undergo a critical reiteration of the consortium of findings over the years on cryoprotective polysaccharide research, rationalize several heuristic models to explain a dual nucleation behavior scenario and put forth a unifying theory to explain in which subset of conditions optimal cryoprotection may emerge from bio-based polysaccharides. We argue that gel-forming, ice-binding polysaccharides that show cryoprotective traits by anticipating nucleation and ice growth act by a combination of kinetic hampering of molecular diffusion (concentration effect); Gibbs-Thomson specific ice binding (templating effect) that induces growth modulation and size reduction; and indulge in the formation of a gel architecture of defined porosity (mesh size effect), the main initiator of a predominant pro-nucleation setting, increased stochastic determinism and the annihilation of large r* nuclei that elicits a small-nuclei survivorship bias. Classical Nucleation Theory formalisms support this hypothesis under the circumstance that a change in system state, initiated by a sol-gel transition near hypothermia, must exist to drive a meaningful shift in system energetics that explains the ANTI/PRO nucleation duality observed. The molecular fractioning of kinetically hindered bulk water into fractionally partitioned gel pores reduces system scale by a mesh size constant and enables the Gibbs-Thomson ice-binding affinity condition to be satisfied when r = rGT. A decreased nucleation energy barrier and maximal r* constraint thus invokes a predominant pro-nucleating system by enhancing nucleation susceptibility.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving disease progression and identifying biomarkers are crucial. Objective: We investigated the association of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) with ChD susceptibility and chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) progression. Methods: A multicentric prospective observational study was conducted with 150 ChD patients (46 indeterminate form, 104 CCC staged A-D) and 42 non-ChD controls from ChD endemic areas from Rio de Janeiro, and Posse in Brazil. Sequencing of circulating miRNAs was performed, and differential expression analyses were conducted. The differentiated miRNAs were submitted to functional analyses related to immune response and cardiovascular signaling pathways. Results: We identified 40 differentially expressed miRNAs between ChD patients and non-ChD controls, highlighting miR-199b-5p, miR-153-3p, miR-143-3p, and miR-223-3p upregulated, and miR-150-3p, miR-4508, miR-486-5p, and miR-3960, downregulated in ChD patients. Moreover, functional analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed that these miRNAs were involved in immune response and cardiovascular signaling pathways. Several miRNAs (miR-6734-5p, miR-1285-5p, miR-10527-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-5187-5p, miR-6515-5p) tended to present a higher expression in patients with severe compared to those with mild CCC, while miR-30c-2-3p presented lower expression in these groups. Conclusion: This study provides evidence for the dysregulation of specific miRNAs in ChD, highlighting their potential role in disease pathophysiology and possible use as biomarkers of ChD susceptibility and CCC severity.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

This study collected samples of M. incognita and soil from Luoyang, Henan, and designed specific primers MiF and MiR based on the amplified 735 bp sequence of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region. These primers exhibit mismatches with related species, including M. javanica, M. minor, M. hapla, and M. arenaria, showing 1, 6, 10, and 10 base differences in the forward direction, respectively, 3, 10, and 9 base mismatches in the reverse direction. Although the primers were used to detect corn-wheat soil samples, no amplification was observed. Additionally a real-time quantitative PCR curve for M. incognita in soil was constructed, revealing a negative correlation between the Ct value (Y) and the log-transformed number of nematodes (x) per 20 g of dry soil, represented by the equation y = -0.9757x + 35.565; (R2 = 0.9999, P < 0.01). According to the decomposition efficiency of nematode DNA in soil, the results showed that nematode DNA degrades rapidly in soil, with a degradation rate of approximately 87.3% at 3 days and 99.97% at 14 days. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in the real-time PCR detection efficiency among various nematode forms: the Ct value of J1 was significantly higher than that of J2, while abnormal eggs (empty eggs or internal bubble eggs) exhibited the highest Ct value. The proportion of abnormal eggs in the soil before planting was significantly higher at 64.08% compared to only 15.3% at harvest, indicating that the activity of nematodes in the soil is significantly reduced after harvesting in October and planting in March of the following year. A survey of 126 tobacco plants indicated a significant positive correlation between the root-knot index (RKI) and root-knot nematode density (r = 0.80, p < 0.01). The study identified a minimum disease threshold of 234 individuals / 20 g soil at harvest and revealed a nonlinear relationship between disease severity and nematode density. Specifically, a weak correlation was observed at low density (Low RKI: 0-1; nematode density<2000 individuals/20 g soil, r = 0.49, P<0.05), while a significant correlation was noted at moderate density (High RKI: nematode density>2000 individuals/20 g soil, r = 0.69, P<0.05). This study showed that as the RKI increases, the rate of increase in nematode density in the soil diminishes.

While BSL structure impacts splicing with the constrained branchpoint sequence in yeast introns, its influence in the flexible context of human branchpoints is unknown. We employed an orthogonal U2 snRNA and splicing reporter to examine effects of perturbing BSL sequence. Changes to BSL base-pairing differentially affect both orthogonal U2 snRNA expression and reporter splicing. High complementarity between the branchpoint sequence and U2 snRNA increases splicing efficiency with WT and stabilized BSL, but not when BSL base-pairing is reduced. Together our data suggest that BSL structure influences the biogenesis of U2 snRNP and that after base pairs are established with the loop of the BSL, the intron drives unwinding of the BSL stem. Finally, we investigated the transcriptome-wide changes when U2 snRNA with either a cancer-associated BSL mutation or with an altered branchpoint recognition sequence is expressed. In both cases, similar changes in splicing and gene expression suggests that while altered U2 snRNA is tolerated, cells respond to their presence by upregulating genes linked to oncogenic pathways.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

E.; Bonachela, J. A.", "abstract": "The problem of pattern and scale remains a central problem in ecology, bridging fundamental and applied questions. Marine microbial communities are a case in point. For instance, to understand the role of zooplankton in oceanic biogeochemistry, their response to changes in environmental conditions, and the implications for ecosystem services (e.g., fisheries), it is critical to understand zooplankton trophic interactions and how they change in a rapidly changing climate. This understanding, however, remains elusive because, unlike for phytoplankton, for which remote sensing of macroscale patterns can provide insight into their microscale dynamics and community composition, obtaining this information for zooplankton largely rests on quantifying the difficult-to-monitor microscale interactions among millions of individuals with different behaviors, and between individuals and their environment. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to obtain indirect information on zooplankton from the macroscale spatial distribution of their prey. To tackle this \"problem of scale\", we develop a rigorous coarse-graining methodology that connects individual-level properties with macroscale spatial patterns. We demonstrate that the shape of the prey spatial distribution can indeed encode information about zooplankton feeding behavior and community dynamics. Specifically, we predict a change in dominant feeding behavior - from non-motile to motile feeding - as one moves from areas of high to areas of low prey density. These results thus suggest a novel application for remote sensing approaches: the potential tracking of consumer behavioral signatures in the large-scale patterns of the resource. Importantly, the scaling-up methodology that we developed to check whether those signatures exist is general, and can be used to link scales rigorously and systematically in any system in which the complexity of individual dynamics makes connecting scales intractable.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Parental care, a key step in the evolution of sociality, has evolved multiple times in insects, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its emergence remain poorly understood. Weevils (Curculionidae) exhibit diverse parental care behaviours, from nest building to egg and larval attendance, making them an ideal system to investigate genomic changes associated with subsociality. We analysed 13 high-quality weevil genomes, encompassing independent origins of egg and larval attendance, to test two predictions: (1) the sheltering hypothesis, where parental care relaxes selection on traits critical for independent larval survival, and (2) the regulatory hypothesis, where behavioural shifts are driven by changes in transcriptional regulation. Gene family evolution analyses revealed significantly more convergent contractions, particularly in genes linked to transcriptional regulation and enzymatic activity, on branches where larval attendance evolved, consistent with functional gene loss under relaxed selection. Selection analyses identified over 400 genes under relaxed selection, especially those associated with transcriptional regulation and neural plasticity, further supporting hypothesis 1. In contrast, positive selection and intensified selection were rare but enriched for genes regulating gene expression, consistent with hypothesis 2. Together, these results suggest that parental care in weevils drives both simplification of larval traits through relaxed selection and convergent gene loss, and innovation in caregiving behaviours via adaptive changes in gene regulation.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

This multidimensional space enables us to map individuals, populations, and species to an evolutionary topography, teasing apart what distinguishes entities from one another. A common exercise is clustering species into adaptive peaks which highlight regions of explored trait space, often considered trait optima or adaptive zones. Typically this reveals broad regions of unpopulated and suboptimal trait space that must be traversed between peaks, however, these evolutionary pathways remain poorly understood. Here we use new sequence-capture and linear morphological datasets to investigate the evolution of the adaptive landscape in a group of highly visible and charismatic reptiles: Amphibolurinae dragon lizards (Family Agamidae). We generate a well-supported time-calibrated phylogenomic tree from >5,000 nuclear markers for more than 360 specimens across 176 dragon species, including undescribed diversity, and provide new insights into the diversification of a group that includes iconic species like the frilled-neck lizard, thorny devil, and bearded dragon. By investigating the multivariate morphological evolution of dragon lizards we show that the colonization of Australia was followed by rapid morphological expansion. While the ancestral amphibolurine was likely tree-living, the evolution of the morphological landscape was facilitated by a transition to a generalist form and then subsequent transitions to more specialized ecomorphs.

To address this challenge, we present tyPPing, an easy-to-use method that efficiently detects and types phage-plasmids with high accuracy. It searches for distinct frequencies and sets of conserved proteins to separate phage-plasmids from plasmids and phages. tyPPing's strength comes from both its precise predictions and its ability to systematically type phage-plasmids, including the assignment of confidence levels. We tested tyPPing on current databases and a collection of incomplete (draft) genomes. While predictions rely on the quality of assemblies, we detected high-quality phage-plasmids and experimentally proved them to be functional. Compared to other classification methods, tyPPing is designed to detect distinct types of phage-plasmids, and surpasses other tools in terms of sensitivity and scalability. Phage-plasmids are highly diverse, making the systematic identification of new types a difficult task.

However, when supergenes persist through millions of years of evolution, they may take on additional functions in different lineages. Here, we investigate how an ancient supergene has evolved to gain novel function. In Formica ants, most species have an ancient \"social\" supergene with M and P haplotypes which determine whether a colony is headed by a single queen or multiple queens, respectively. At least three Formica species have an additional haplotype on the same chromosome, termed MD, associated with female-biased offspring sex ratio at the colony level. Is an MD haplotype present in additional species? Do the MD haplotypes share a common origin or did they evolve convergently? With whole-genome resequencing, we identify MD haplotypes in three additional species and use variation across six Formica species to examine the evolutionary history of the MD haplotype. We find that the MD haplotype did not originate from a rearrangement of the ancestral M haplotype. Instead, the MD haplotype likely originated from recombination between the M and P haplotypes. Strikingly, we identified two putative origins of the MD haplotype, one in the ancestor of five Nearctic species, and a second in the Palearctic species F. cinerea. The discovery of two MD haplotypes convergently evolving from distinct recombination events between two ancestral supergene haplotypes illustrates how supergenes can diversify and gain additional phenotypes.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

This approach can be a powerful tool for understanding the molecular landscape of tumors, such as prostate cancer, by providing information in the same tissue context. Studying the expression of multiple genes in the same tissue is often necessary. ERG, SPINK1, ETV1, and ETV4 are all relevant genes in the context of prostate cancer. ERG is a transcription factor, and its fusion with the TMPRSS2 gene is one of the most common genetic alterations in prostate cancer. Overexpression of the ERG protein due to this gene, involved in gene fusion with TMPRSS2 and rarely with other 5' partner genes, can be detected using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) due to the availability of a characterized antibody. SPINK1 (serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1) is an overexpressed protein in a subset of prostate cancers that do not harbor ERG rearrangements. High SPINK1 expression is known to be associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype in some studies. SPINK1 expression can be detected using a well-characterized antibody by IHC. ETV1 and ETV4 are transcription factors that can also be involved in gene fusions in prostate cancer, albeit less frequently than ERG. There are no well-characterized antibodies for ETV1 and ETV4. Due to the mutually exclusive expression of ERG, SPINK1, ETV1, and ETV4, simultaneous evaluation of these genes can provide valuable information on the molecular subtype of prostate cancer, which can have implications for the assessment of inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity, prognosis, and potential treatment.

Here, we provide the first evidence of transgenerational inheritance of enhanced ability to learn complex tasks in the mammalian rodent brain. These inherited learning enhancements are not limited to specific stimuli, sensory modalities, or learning paradigms. Using behavioral, cellular biophysical, methylomics, genetics and molecular methods, we find that the inherited epigenetic modifications reflect an enhanced neuronal learning state, driven by increased intrinsic neuronal excitability in most pyramidal neurons in the relevant neuronal networks. This enhancement is mediated by persistent downregulation of the muscarinic M-current and is associated with widespread changes in DNA methylation, notably within coding genes associated with the M-current, the Kv7 pathway, in the hippocampi of trained F0 rats, as well as in non-coding RNAs in their sperm samples. Remarkably, a significant portion of these DNA methylation changes were also observed in the hippocampi of their untrained F1 offspring. These findings suggest that complex learning abilities can be inherited in the mammalian brain, as the offspring of trained rodents are born with the biophysical modifications that enable them to become super-learners, the exact change that occurs in their parents' brains only after the rule learning.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

While Wnt, FGF, and BMP signaling pathways have well-established and essential roles in several aspects of NCC development, the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway has received limited attention for any specific role in this process. Herein, we propose two distinct, temporal roles for the transcription factor GLI3 in NCC development. Gli3, and other members of the HH pathway, were robustly co-expressed with established NCC induction and specification markers in chick, mouse, and human embryonic stem cell derived NCCs. Early knock-down of GLI3 reduced expression of key markers of NCC specification and conditional knock-out of Gli3 post-specification specifically impaired the ability of cranial NCCs to differentiate into ectomesenchymal derivatives.

We find that chemical energy is similarly patterned during morphogenesis. Specifically, mitochondria are locally enriched at the apical sides of epithelial cells during apical constriction, which is widely used across the animal kingdom to fold epithelial tissues. Timelapse imaging, spatial transcriptomics, and measurements of oxygen consumption rate reveal that mitochondrial density, potential, and ATP increase in epithelial cells prior to actomyosin contraction and tissue folding, which is prevented by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial enrichment and apicobasal patterning are conserved during apical constriction in flies, chicks, and mice, and these subcellular patterns can be used to predict computationally patterns of tissue folding. These findings highlight a spatial dimension of bioenergetics in embryonic development.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

A.; Henikoff, S.", "abstract": "Chromatin structure plays a central role in defining cell identity by regulating gene expression. During development, shifts in chromatin structure facilitate changes in gene expression needed to specify distinct cell types. To understand how changes in chromatin structure influence the developmental trajectory of neural progenitor cells, we developed CUT&TIME, a technique that uses a hyperactive 6-methyl adenosine (6mA) methyltransferase pulsed in living cells to map historical chromatin accessibility genome-wide in single cells. We show that CUT&TIME produces a record of the chromatin landscape during neurogenesis in the developing retina, specifically as neural progenitors produce the major projection neuron type, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We further show that this method is compatible with single cell profiling technologies, which allows us to visualize and capture the diversity of chromatin states that produce RGCs. Additionally, we identify changes in promoter accessibility associated with the transition from progenitor to RGC. Together, these data demonstrate that CUT&TIME captures a historical record of chromatin structure, which can be used to identify early changes in accessibility associated with cell-fate commitment.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

In this study, we focused on engineering polymer aggregation in detail to further improve tumor microenvironment-responsive cytotoxicity. PVA-U with grafting degrees (G.D.) of 3% (PVA-U3), 15% (PVA-U15), and 25% (PVA-U25) were synthesized and their aggregation properties cytotoxicity was evaluated. The difference in half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between pH 7.4 and pH 6.5 for PVA-U15 was 4.3-fold, which was greater than that of PVA-U25 at 2.8-fold, suggesting that tumor microenvironment-responsive cytotoxicity could be regulated by controlling G.D. of UDCA. Interestingly, PVA-U15 formed aggregates in the pericellular environment and adsorbed on the cell, effectively inducing cell death whereas PVA-U3 and PVA-U25 showed internalization in the cell. These results indicated that the balance of the surface charge and hydrophobicity could contribute to the adsorption on the cell membrane. These findings are expected to contribute to the development of membrane disruption strategies to control the aggregation properties and cell membrane interaction.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Human visual system organizes objects based on a representational hierarchy. However, it remains unclear whether this hierarchy arises from visual or semantic information. One hypothesis posits that the visual system is structured around statistical regularities of visual information. Here, we test this hypothesis using the THINGS datasets and pure-visual deep neural networks (DNN). We constructed a low-dimensional object space based on multiple abstract object properties, reflecting statistical patterns of visual regularities. By applying voxelwise encoding models, we identified clusters in the higher visual cortex based on their property tuning, and they were found to support specific object categories. These clusters serve as the middle level to reveal a property-cluster-object hierarchical organization. Subsequently, we investigated whether this hierarchical structure could be captured by a self-supervised DNN. Through activity similarity analysis, we mapped the brain clusters onto the DNN and independently found that the DNN's clusters exhibited distinct property tuning and influenced the classification accuracy of corresponding object categories, mirroring the effects observed in the human brain. Our results demonstrate similar hierarchical structures in the human brain and self-supervised DNN, suggesting that the visual regularities shape neural architecture of visual system.

This experience occurs alongside continuous prediction of upcoming contents, raising questions regarding the potential relationship between these phenomena. Is the activation of predictive mechanisms sufficient for subjective experience, or can it proceed when the mind wanders away? Participants (N = 25) listened to audiobook content (>12,000 words) while providing self-reports of mind-wandering. Such reports were associated with spectral changes in the EEG signal and decreased early response to word onset, in line with current accounts of mind-wandering. In contrast, markers of word-level contextual surprise (indexed by the contextual surprise of Language Models) remained intact during mind-wandering, alongside significant encoding of semantic contents. Last, we measured the neural encoding of predictive context, measured by the correlation between EEG and the vectorial embeddings that Language Models use to predict each word given prior context. This encoding also remained strong during mind-wandering, albeit weaker compared to attentive periods. Our findings show that the brain predicts and monitors relevant inputs even when we disengage from the external environment. It suggests that the shared computational mechanisms between humans and Language Models are insufficient for experiencing the meaning of speech contents, with implications for theoretical accounts of mind-wandering and predictive processing accounts of consciousness.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

W.; Corbin, F.; Laurent, B.", "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which encodes the multifunctional RNA-binding protein FMRP. While FMRP is best known for its roles in RNA metabolism, it can also associate with chromatin through recognition of histone H3 lysine 79 di-methylation (H3K79me2), an epigenetic mark linked to transcriptionally active genes. However, the functional relevance of this FMRP-H3K79me2 interaction has remained largely unexplored in the context of FXS pathophysiology. We assessed H3K79me2 levels during the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells generated from both healthy individuals and FXS patients and discovered a global increase in H3K79me2 levels specifically in FXS neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Altered H3K79me2 landscape drives widespread transcriptional dysregulation, marked by reduced expression of neurogenesis-associated genes and aberrant upregulation of programs promoting proliferation and glial lineage commitment. Functionally, these alterations result in enhanced NPC proliferation and a biased differentiation trajectory. Together, our findings uncover an H3K79me2-dependent epigenetic checkpoint that governs NPC proliferation and lineage commitment. We further establish FMRP as a critical component of this checkpoint, linking its loss to the neurodevelopmental defects characteristic of FXS.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Retinoic acid (RA) homeostasis is altered across psychiatric disorders but whether impaired developmental RA signaling impacts the functionality of DA-related reward processing at adulthood remains poorly explored. Herein, we explored in male and female mice how developmental vitamin A deficiency (VAD), as a model of blunted RA signaling, could impact motivational processes through a modulation of mesolimbic DA transmission. Behavioral performances were evaluated using operant conditioning tasks, parallel with investigations of the integrity of DA transmission through biochemical analyses of markers of DA transmission and measures of DA dynamics using DA biosensor coupled with fiber photometry. Finally, chemogenetic manipulation of the mesolimbic DA pathway was used to normalize DA transmission and assess the effect on motivational performance in VAD offspring. Developmental VAD induced sex-specific alterations of reward-related processes at adulthood. Indeed, while female behavioral performances were spared, VAD males exhibited elevated instrumental performance and impulsivity. These behavioral alterations were coherent with reduced DA transporter (DAT) expression and increased DA dynamic in the mesolimbic pathway. Strikingly, chemogenetic inhibition of the mesolimbic DA pathway normalized motivational performance in VAD males. Our results show that developmental RA hyposignaling induces sex-specific reward processing alterations in adulthood through hyperactivity of the mesolimbic DA pathway. Our data support that developmental impairment in RA signaling might be at the core of reward-related symptoms across psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

As the disease advances, atrophy spreads to the perisylvian regions, accompanied by non-semantic language impairments. Despite these clinical findings, the network mechanisms behind cross-domain linguistic deficits remain poorly understood. In this study, we used our recently developed meta-networking framework of cortical language network dynamics to systematically examine domain-specific network disruptions in SD. Using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) and comprehensive neuropsychological tests across several language domains, we analyzed data from SD patients at two timepoints: baseline (n = 42) and a 2-year follow-up (n = 24). Our findings showed that the framework successfully identified domain-specific language network degeneration. Beyond the ATL, progressive atrophy disrupted the dynamic separation of language networks involved in semantic processing, phonological processing, and speech production. These disruptions were characterized by state-specific hypo- and hyper-connectivity patterns that related to distinct language impairments. At follow-up, atrophy extended to posterior temporal and prefrontal regions, worsening network function. Importantly, the patterns of language network disruption predicted individual language deficits, providing a mechanistic link between structural degeneration, functional network changes, and clinical symptoms.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}

Here we reveal an unexpected scaling pattern, and its superorganismal regulation, within the hyperdiverse genus Pheidole. We discovered that antennal sizing between the small worker and the big soldier is identical, lacking inter-caste scaling (antennae-body scaling is decoupled) yet retaining intra-caste scaling. Furthermore, we have pinpointed the evolutionary origin of this decoupling. Finally, manipulations of social environment, developmental hormones, and interorgan signalling influences the modularity-integration of trait-body covariation, uncovering head-to-body decoupling and the production of novel nanosoldiers. Collectively, this challenges our previous understandings of trait covariation, modularity, and their regulation, from individual to society and across species.", "date": "2025-08-31", "journal": ""}
