M.; Gaston, D.; Uniacke, J.; McCormick, C.", "abstract": "Herpesvirus genomes are decoded by host RNA polymerase II, generating messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) that are post-transcriptionally modified and exported to the cytoplasm. These viral mRNAs have 5'-m7GTP caps and poly-adenylate (polyA) tails that should permit assembly of canonical eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) cap-binding complexes to initiate protein synthesis. However, we have shown that chemical disruption of eIF4F does not impede KSHV lytic replication, suggesting that alternative translation initiation factors (TIFs) support viral protein synthesis. Here we show that eIF4F and an alternative TIF known as eIF3d both contribute to the accumulation of viral proteins during KSHV lytic replication, with eIF3d supporting accumulation of viral proteins when eIF4F is depleted and vice-versa. However, eIF3d depletion greatly diminished release of infectious virions even when eIF4F was available to compensate for lost translation initiation capacity. This viral replication failure in the absence of eIF3d correlated with diminished accumulation of many enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and reduced accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Moreover, we demonstrated that eIF3d was required to support efficient translation of essential cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes SQLE and MVK during lytic replication. These findings position eIF3d as a critical TIF not only required to support efficient translation of KSHV lytic mRNAs during times of need, but also to support the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol required to successfully complete an infectious cycle.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We find that DNAme data are very effective for inferring the epigenomic prior network, recapitulating known epigenomic network structure found previously from chromatin accessibility data. Furthermore, we find that inferring the epigenomic prior network from DNAme data reveals candidate TF cis-regulations for at least eight times as many genes, when compared with chromatin accessibility data. When our proposed methodology is applied to real datasets from human embryonic development and from women at risk of breast cancer, we find patterns of differential cis-regulation that are in line with expectations under appropriate biological models, and that can be used to identify pre-cancerous epigenomic changes.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}
{"title": "An Epidemic Diversity conceptual model explains how host genetic diversity affects variation in parasite success", "doi": "10.1101/2024.05.28.596150", "authors": "Paplauskas, S.", "abstract": "According to conventional wisdom, disease transmission rate is usually higher in more genetically homogenous host populations. Previous studies have principally considered how host population genetic diversity impacts the mean of parasite infection performance. However, when considering risks from epidemics and the emergence of novel infectious diseases, variability in parasite success may be just as important as the mean. Here we propose an Epidemic Diversity Model for how host-parasite population genetic diversity influences both the mean and variability in parasite success. We evaluate this conceptual model by re-analysing effect size data from two meta-analyses, including 211 comparisons of high versus low genetic diversity host populations from 48 studies. Our analysis challenges previous understanding by demonstrating that high host population genetic diversity only reduces mean parasite success for specialist parasites with narrow host range, but not for generalist multi-host parasites. We also find that the combination of host range and parasite population genetic diversity determine the effect of host population genetic diversity on the variability in parasite success. These results have important implications for the management of host population genetic diversity for natural populations.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

K.; Mushtaq, Z.; Reddy-Alla, S.; Kumar, V.", "abstract": "Synaptic growth and organization are orchestrated by pre and postsynaptic signaling, neuronal activity, and environmental cues. Although endocytosis is known to attenuate synaptic growth, the underlying signaling mechanisms have remained elusive. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized mechanism by which endocytosis constrains synaptic growth through regulation of the neuronal E3 ubiquitin ligase Highwire (Hiw/Phr1). We show that loss of endocytosis causes Hiw to accumulate in neuronal cell bodies, leading to elevated MAP3K Wallenda (Wnd)/DLK levels and hyperactivation of JNK signaling. The accumulated Hiw assembles into dynamic liquid liquid phase separated condensates, as revealed by their rapid and reversible dissolution with 1,6 hexanediol. Acute blockade of endocytosis using a temperature sensitive dynamin mutant Shibirets similarly triggered robust Hiw phase separation. We further demonstrate that Rab11 positive recycling endosomes are essential for proper Hiw localization and turnover, directly linking endosomal trafficking to the control of JNK signaling. Finally, we show that both BMP and JNK signaling are necessary and sufficient to guide synaptic morphogenesis at the Drosophila NMJ, thereby integrating endocytic trafficking with synaptic growth signaling. Our findings establish endocytosis as a critical regulator of Hiw/Phr1 dependent JNK signaling via liquid liquid phase separation, with implications that extend beyond synaptic morphogenesis to axon injury and degeneration pathways.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Newly formed polyploids must quickly adjust their cell division machinery to maintain stable chromosome inheritance, while long-term stabilization involves rediploidization, returning the genome to a diploid-like state. Here, we investigate the origin and early genome evolution of Arabidopsis suecica, a hybrid polyploid derived from A. thaliana and A. arenosa. Leveraging a recent genome assembly for A. suecica along with population level whole-genome resequencing of all three species, we identify the closest progenitors to A. suecica and use this knowledge to examine genes under positive selection and to assess compensatory dynamics between homeologs carrying loss-of-function mutations. Our findings show that both parental species were diploid, including the paternal A. arenosa progenitor. We identify evidence for de novo adaptation to allopolyploidy within the A. arenosa sub-genome of A. suecica, including genes involved in homolog pairing and recombination. Although relaxed purifying selection is evident, likely due to the genome-wide redundancy, we observe functional compensation between homeologous gene pairs in A. suecica: when one copy loses function, the other maintains it. Together, these findings revise the origin of A. suecica and identify early genome stabilization mechanisms, including evidence for meiotic adaptation and mutational buffering through homeologous gene compensation.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Although division of labor as a means to increase productivity is a common feature in animal social groups, most previous studies have focused almost exclusively on eusocial insects with extreme task partitioning. Empirical evidence of division of labor in vertebrates is scarce, largely because we lack a theoretical framework to explore the conditions under which division of labor is likely to evolve in cooperatively breeding systems where helpers remain capable of breeding throughout their lifetime. By explicitly considering alternative helping tasks with varying fitness costs, we model how individual decisions on task specialization may influence the emergence of division of labor under both direct and indirect fitness benefits. Surprisingly, we find that direct survival benefits of living in larger groups are the primary force driving the evolution of cooperation to enhance group productivity, and that indirect fitness benefits derived from related group members are only a non-essential facilitator of more stable forms of division of labor in cooperative breeders. In addition, we find that division of labor in vertebrates is favored by harsh environments. Ultimately, our model not only makes key predictions that are consistent with existing empirical data, but also proposes novel avenues for new empirical work in vertebrate and invertebrate systems alike.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

The current study, using a sample of healthy, young adults (N = 39; 21.7{+/-}2.6 y, 61.5% female), tested the acute effects of morning exposure (09:00-11:00) to four artificial lights on attention and alertness with the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). The PVT was administered three times in short-wavelength 'blue' light [SWL, high melanopic illuminance], long-wavelength 'red' light [LWL, low melanopic illuminance], and bright white light [BWL] of high correlated color temperature, and white dim light [DL] as control condition. PVT measures included fluctuations in attention, quantified as intra-individual Reaction Time (RT) variability and the number of lapses; mean RT; and optimum response capability (10% fastest RTs). Compared to DL, participants had significantly fewer lapses and faster mean RT during SWL and LWL, and they enhanced their optimum responses in LWL. There were no significant effects of BWL, and light did not affect RT variability. Surprisingly, SWL was not superior to LWL. Hence, our results suggest that light of both high and low melanopic illuminance can improve alertness and attention in the morning.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

In early life, brain-age can reflect underlying biological maturity (or immaturity), providing a candidate predictor of typical neurodevelopment versus deviation. Although widely used in adult research, the use of brain-age in early development has been limited due to data availability, heterogeneity and restricted model accessibility. Here, we introduce BabyPy, a shareable brain-age model for individuals aged 0-17 years that achieves accurate predictions despite substantial variability in site, scanner, and preprocessing pipelines.\n\nMethodsWe trained BabyPy on 4,021 structural T1-weighted MRI scans from multi-site datasets (ages 0-17 years). An external test set of 1,143 scans (ages 0-16 years) was used for validation. Coarse neuroimaging features - grey matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV), and subcortical grey matter volume (sGMV) - along with sex, were the model inputs. An ensemble machine learning approach combined Extra Trees Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron base models.

Here, we reveal an unexpected role for the DDR at the cell surface, in mediating immune evasion from complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), an innate immune mechanism exploited by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In the context of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where the anti-CD20 mAb rituximab utilizes CDC, we show that genotoxic chemotherapy induces expression of membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) CD46, CD55, and CD59, thereby reducing CDC sensitivity and compromising rituximab activity. In this setting, CD59 emerged as the dominant DDR-induced inhibitor of complement-mediated killing. A high-throughput kinase inhibitor screen identified checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) as a critical mediator of this response. Mechanistically, DNA damage activates Chk1, enhancing CD59 transcription via an Sp1-bound promoter. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry revealed a Chk1 dependent remodelling of Sp1-associated complexes to a transcriptionally active state with recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase KAT2A. These findings expand the role of the DDR in immune resistance at the tumor cell surface, and highlight a negative interaction between chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies that may require sequential administration or targeting of the Chk1-Sp1-CD59 axis.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

E.; Covino, R.", "abstract": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a crucial signaling network that preserves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, impacting both health and disease. When ER stress occurs, often due to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, the UPR initiates a broad cellular program to counteract cytotoxic effects. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a conserved ER-bound protein, is a key sensor of ER stress and activator of the UPR. While biochemical studies confirm IRE1's role in recognizing unfolded polypeptides, high-resolution structures showing direct interactions remain elusive. Consequently, the precise structural mechanism by which IRE1 senses unfolded proteins is debated. In this study, we employed advanced molecular modeling and 136,7 microseconds of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to clarify how IRE1 detects unfolded proteins. Our results demonstrate that IRE1's luminal domain directly interacts with unfolded peptides and reveal how these interactions can stabilize higher-order oligomers. We provide a detailed molecular characterization of unfolded peptide binding, identifying two distinct binding pockets at the dimer's center, separate from its central groove. Furthermore, we present high-resolution structures illustrating how BiP associates with IRE1's oligomerization interface, thus preventing the formation of larger complexes. Our structural model reconciles seemingly contradictory experimental findings, offering a unified perspective on the diverse sensing models proposed.

This classification is important for assessing the diversity of biological systems. Taxonomic classification faces two main challenges: first, accuracy is critical as errors can propagate to downstream analysis results; and second, the classification time requirements can limit study size and study design, in particular when considering the constantly growing reference databases. To address these two challenges, we introduce raxtax, an efficient, novel taxonomic classification tool for barcodes that uses common k-mers between all pairs of query and reference sequences. We also introduce two novel uncertainty scores which take into account the fundamental biases of reference databases. Results: We validate raxtax on three widely used empirical reference databases and show that it is 2.7-100 times faster than competing state-of-the-art tools on the largest database while being equally accurate. In particular, raxtax exhibits increasing speedups with growing query and reference sequence numbers compared to existing tools (for 100,000 and 1,000,000 query and reference sequences overall, it is 1.3 and 2.9 times faster, respectively), and therefore alleviates the taxonomic classification scalability challenge.

While the principles of nuclear architecture have been well-characterized in animals and plants, their functional relevance in filamentous fungi remains largely uncharacterized. The wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici presents a unique model for genome evolution, with a compartmentalized genome comprising conserved core and highly variable accessory chromosomes linked to genome plasticity. Here, we present the first 3D genome analysis of a eukaryotic organism with an extensive set of accessory chromosomes, revealing a hierarchical genome architecture integrating core and accessory regions. Results: At the nuclear level, centromere clustering defines the global genome conformation. Accessory chromosomes are spatially segregated from core arms but maintain focal contacts with pericentromeric regions of core chromosomes, contributing to mitotic stability. At finer resolution, we identify homotypic interactions among heterochromatin-rich compartments and self-interacting domains demarcated by specific histone marks, gene expression profiles, and insulator-like sequence motifs. Notably, a subset of highly insulated, transposon-rich heterochromatic domains forms strong inter-domain interactions. Additionally, domains defined under axenic conditions with coordinated transcriptional activation during wheat infection suggest a link between 3D architecture and dynamic gene regulation. Conclusion: Our study uncovers the multi-scale principles of nuclear organization in a major fungal plant pathogen and reveals how hierarchical nuclear architecture contributes to gene expression coordination and genome stability.

V.", "abstract": "Influenza viruses are characterized by high mutation rates and extensive genetic diversity, which hinder effective vaccine development and facilitate immune evasion (Taubenberger & Morens, 2006; Barr et al., 2010). These mutations primarily arise from the error-prone activity of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts. This phenomenon aligns with the quasi-species model, in which a cloud of related viral genomes evolves under selective pressures (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and informing future vaccine design. However, conventional RNA sequencing technologies often fail to reliably detect low-frequency variants due to technical errors introduced during sample preparation and sequencing steps. In this study, we implemented a single unique molecular identifier (sUMI) approach to minimize sequencing artifacts and achieve an error rate of approximately 10-. This high-resolution method enabled precise quantification of quasi-species diversity from influenza virus populations isolated at the single-particle level. Comparative analyses revealed mutation frequencies well above background error levels, confirming that the observed variation was of biological origin. Furthermore, application of information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen-Shannon divergence demonstrated that the mutation distribution was non-random, suggesting the presence of selective constraints.

E.", "abstract": "Human mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) converts superoxide (O2[bullet]-) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and molecular oxygen (O2), serving as a key defense against oxidative damage. Despite extensive studies, the full structural characterization of H2O2-binding sites in MnSOD remains largely unexplored. Previous H2O2-soaked MnSOD structures have identified two distinct H2O2-binding sites: one directly ligated to the catalytic Mn (LIG position) and another at the active site gateway (PEO position) between second-shell residues Tyr34 and His30. In this study, a kinetically impaired Gln143Asn MnSOD variant is used to trap and explore additional H2O2-binding sites beyond the second-shell solvent gate. In the wild-type enzyme, Gln143 mediates proton transfers with the Mn-bound solvent (WAT1) to drive redox cycling of the metal, necessary for effective O2[bullet]- dismutation. Substitution with Asn stalls catalysis because the increased distance from WAT1 disrupts critical proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) events, and the redox cycling of the active site metal is impaired. This, in turn, stalls the electrostatic cycling of positive charge on the enzyme surface and enhances the likelihood of trapping transient H2O2-bound states in this variant. Results reveal several H2O2 molecules leading up to the active site, in addition to the canonical LIG and PEO positions.

The prevailing disequilibrium, stemming from hyperactivation of the glutamatergic system, culminates in progressive neuronal impairment and cognitive deterioration. This study aimed to elucidate the contributory role of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7), identified as the second most critical genetic determinant in AD, in glutamatergic-associated neurotoxicity. This endeavor sought to advance molecular comprehension of neurological disorders where Glu-GABA neurotransmission represents a pivotal pharmacotherapeutic target. Utilizing multi-omics approaches, we rigorously analyzed four distinct mouse models, both with and without APPtg and ABCA7 expression, to simulate varied pathological and ABCA7-deficient states. Our results revealed amyloid-beta (A{beta}) deposition as a catalyst for surging glutamatergic transmission. Notably, ABCA7 ablation exacerbated glutamatergic-induced neurotoxicity, attributed to diminished enzymatic activity related to neurotransmitter degradation and amplified expression levels of specific neurotransmitter transport proteins and receptor subunits, notably NMDA, AMPA, and GABAA. These findings furnish the first comprehensive description elucidating ABCA7's amplification of neurotoxic effects through modulation of Glu-GABA neurotransmission systems in neurodegenerative contexts, primarily mediated by lipid interaction. The evidence underscores ABCA7's imperative role in shaping future pharmacological strategies aimed at counteracting neurodegeneration precipitated by Glu-mediated neurotoxicity.

We applied a standardized pipeline - combining sequence and structure based pocket prediction (Concavity), electrostatic profiling (APBS), and pharmacokinetic filtering (Lipinskis rules, ADMET) - to generate high-confidence binding sites.

Using microfluidics to trap and image single cells throughout their lifespans, we find that lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression is accompanied by formation of cytoplasmic Ssd1 foci. The age-dependent Ssd1 foci are condensates that appear dynamically in a cell cycle-dependent manner and their failure to resolve during mitosis coincided with the end of lifespan. Ssd1 overexpression was epistatic with calorie restriction (CR) for lifespan extension and yeast overexpressing Ssd1 or undergoing CR were resistant to iron supplementation-induced lifespan shortening while their lifespans were reduced by iron chelation. The nuclear translocation of the Aft1 transcriptional regulator of the iron regulon occurred during aging in a manner that predicted remaining lifespan, but was prevented by CR. Accordingly, age-dependent induction of the Fit2 and Arn1 high-affinity iron transporters within the iron regulon was reduced by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Consistent with age-dependent activation of the iron regulon, intracellular iron accumulated during aging but was prevented by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Moreover, lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression or CR was epistatic to inactivation of the iron regulon. These studies reveal that CR and Ssd1 overexpression extend the yeast replicative lifespan by blocking deleterious age-dependent iron uptake, identifying novel therapeutic targets for lifespan extension.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Local translation of axonal mRNAs is a key regulator of nociceptor plasticity, yet how axonal transcriptome dynamics contribute to inflammatory sensitisation remains unclear. Using compartmentalised culture systems and RNA-sequencing, we defined axonal and somatic transcriptomes in embryonic (E16.5) and adult (W8) DRG neurons and assessed their remodelling after PGE2 exposure. We identify a conserved core axonal transcriptome spanning embryonic to adult stages, prominently enriched for ribosomal and mitochondrial functions, consistent with sustained translational and metabolic demands. PGE2 elicited compartment-specific reprogramming: pathways related to sensory processing and pain were upregulated in axons but downregulated in somata. Functionally, prolonged axonal PGE2 exposure enhanced capsaicin-evoked calcium responses and drove retrograde sensitisation of neuronal somata. Integrating transcriptomics with functional assays, we pinpointed Tnfrsf12a (Fn14), a cytokine receptor linked to regeneration and neuropathic pain, as a PGE2-induced axonal mRNA. Crucially, local axonal knockdown of Tnfrsf12a significantly reduced neuronal excitability, providing proof-of-concept that axonally enriched transcripts can be targeted to modulate sensitisation. These findings position conserved axonal transcriptome programmes as drivers of peripheral sensitisation and establish Tnfrsf12a/Fn14 as a therapeutic candidate for inflammatory pain.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Promoter-motif analysis of PPi genes revealed conserved enrichment of nuclear receptor TFs (ESR1, NR4A1, RXRA, NR1H3/LXR) and metabolic regulators (SREBF1, CEBPB, HNF4A) across mouse and human orthologues. Supporting this, analysis of public RNA-seq datasets and RT-qPCR in wild-type and Abcc6-/- mice demonstrated tight co-expression of these genes in the liver and the kidney, as central transcriptional hub of systemic PPi regulation.

Abcc6-/- mice exhibited persistently reduced although gradually increasing PPi and altered Pi/PPi ratios during aging. Translating these findings to humans, plasma PPi correlated inversely with AP activity and positively with Pi, though associations were weaker in ABCC6-deficient pseudoxanthoma elasticum patients.

The classical explanation is a Cost of Fidelity, which posits a tradeoff between selection to reduce deleterious mutations and selection to minimize resources devoted to genome surveillance. An alternative is the Drift Barrier, whereby the mutation rate is under directional selection downward; at equilibrium, the increase in fitness from a further increase in replication fidelity is too small to overcome genetic drift. We propagated C. elegans mutation accumulation (MA) lines under minimal selection for ~150 generations, divided each line into two sublines and propagated them for another ~150 generations. The base-substitution rate did not change, but variation among lines increased, as predicted by the CoF. Conversely, the insertion/deletion rate increased, as predicted by the DB. The base-substitution spectrum did not change, whereas the spectra of insertions and deletions did. Also of interest is the nature of selection on deleterious mutations. If epistasis is synergistic, several evolutionary quandaries could be resolved. To quantify mutational effects on fitness, and to characterize the pattern of epistasis, we assayed competitive fitness at 150 and 300 generations. Mutations had a mean effect of -0.1%, and a model of constant mutational effects (no epistasis) satisfactorily explains the results.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

However, the proximate mechanism of Darwinian fitness signaled through music has not. As popular music and dance functionally aim to hold an observers attention, we investigate features in various sounds that might stimulate attentive behavior in an audience. We propose a calculus of attention to moving objects and sound to ascertain their f(x) = location = positional control, f(x) = energy = change in position, and f\"(x) = surprise = change in direction. We developed statistical software to (A) analyze nine features of sound related to acoustic control, energy, and surprise (CES), (B) map dynamic song trajectories within the multivariate space of CES, and (C) measure how stable performances are within this space (i.e. signaling fitness). When musical sounds are compared to animal vocalizations, human speech, and non-biological sounds including noise, we statistically confirm that music maintains the highest stability in the space of CES. This fitness signal related to attention varies across musical genres and is also detected animal calls as well. Attention signaling also differs significantly between experts versus novice musicians, adult versus immature bird songs, and is constrained by musical performance interactions with live audiences as well. We conclude that audiovisual signaling via this calculus of attention to behavioral display reflects the physics of observing bodies in motion, probably originating from selective pressure of intra/interspecific conflicts formed at the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, and retained in modern music today.\n\nLay SummaryMost animals (including humans) pay attention to specific audiovisual stimuli within their environment. Here we explore common features of these stimuli and propose a single mathematical framework (with software) for detecting and measuring attention signaling in the context of sound.

However, the molecular pathways and RNAs regulated by Imp to control these processes remain poorly understood. Embryos derived from Imp mutant germline clones arrest development, and transcriptome analysis revealed significant dysregulation of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, tube morphogenesis, neuronal projection development, and RNA metabolism, along with de-repression of transposable element (TE) RNAs. Consistent with these findings, Imp mutant embryos display TE-overexpression phenotypes, are smaller in size, and exhibit defective organ development, including impaired tracheal branching and gastrulation. Reduced levels of Imp at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) impair synaptic bouton formation and decrease adult longevity. RIP-seq experiments showed that Imp-associated RNAs are enriched for TE RNAs. Proteomic analyses confirmed that several TE-encoded proteins are upregulated in Imp mutant embryos. Specifically, the Ty1 family retrotransposon Copia was derepressed. Consistent with recent findings that Copia is a potent inhibitor of synaptogenesis, its upregulation likely contributes to the impaired NMJ formation and broader embryonic defects observed in Imp mutants. Moreover, Imp associates with piRNA pathway proteins, ensures Piwi nuclear localization, and--like Piwi mutants--its loss disrupts TE silencing and causes position-effect variegation (PEV) defects. The analysis of Imp complexes further points to potential mechanisms by which Imp may regulate TE expression.

Research focusing on isolating the vascular components of the BOLD signal revealed that markers of cerebrovascular health, such as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), serve as valuable biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. This study examines the relationship between vascular metrics and noise in a cohort comprising individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HC). Vascular responses were assessed using three functional contrasts during a hypercapnic challenge: arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) reactivity, vascular space occupancy (VASO) to quantify cerebral blood volume (CBV) reactivity, and BOLD imaging. Noise metrics were derived from multi-echo BOLD resting-state data by isolating the TE-independent components of the signal. Mean correlation coefficients for noise vs ASL-CVR are: (-0.12 {+/-} 0.06) for HC, (-0.14 {+/-} 0.08) for MCI, (-0.11 {+/-} 0.05) for AD.

However, the impact of autoregulation mechanisms on local vascular responses and microcirculatory perfusion remains poorly understood. Given that impaired autoregulation is common in pathologies such as ischemic stroke, quantifying vessel-level responses can help to inform clinical strategies. Here, we present a novel in silico model that incorporates static myogenic and endothelial regulatory mechanisms to simulate CBF in large microvascular networks derived from realistic surface vasculatures of mice with and without leptomeningeal collaterals (LMCs). We assessed the role of autoregulation mechanisms under three conditions: i) healthy autoregulation, ii) ischaemic stroke and reperfusion with altered vascular reactivity, and iii) chronic autoregulation dysfunction after stroke. For healthy autoregulation, our model reproduced the classic static autoregulation curve and identified the dominant contribution of surface arteries in buffering pressure changes. Networks with lower descending arteriole density exhibited more extensive arterial dilations, reflecting the topological influence on vessel diameter changes. During reperfusion after stroke, we investigated the interplay between LMCs and parameters governing the vasoreactive response. While LMCs play a crucial role in maintaining residual perfusion in adjacent regions during MCA occlusion, our results suggest that their extent alone does not substantially influence perfusion after recanalization. Instead, alterations in myogenic reactivity emerged as the key contributor to hyperperfusion, underscoring the importance of regulatory mechanisms in determining reperfusion outcomes. To mimic chronic autoregulatory dysfunction, we progressively impaired regulatory capacity in arteries on the middle cerebral artery (MCA) side, reflecting the territory previously affected by stroke. The loss of autoregulation in proximal vessels significantly disrupts capillary perfusion and alters the autoregulation curve. To our knowledge, this is the first in silico study to explore cerebral autoregulation at the microvascular level under both physiological and pathological conditions.

Cerebral hypoperfusion is also an extremely common consequence of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases (CVRFs/CVDs), which usually manifest in midlife, when AD pathology initiates, and actively contribute to AD onset and progression. Previously our lab has demonstrated that the vasculotropic Dutch mutant, amyloid beta Q22, and amyloid beta 42 promote endothelial cells (ECs) apoptosis, barrier permeability, and angiogenic impairments. Prior research has indicated that hypoperfusion promotes analogous EC dysfunction. Amyloid beta deposition occurs within a hypoperfused environment in AD, but whether exposure of cerebral ECs to amyloid beta under hypoperfusion results in potentiated cerebral EC dysfunction through activation of common molecular mechanisms remained unknown. Methods: Human cerebral ECs were treated with Amyloid beta 40-Q22 or Amyloid beta 42, glucose deprivation (GD), or a combination of both, under normoxia or hypoxia conditions. Cell death mechanisms (apoptosis/necrosis), endothelial barrier dysfunction/permeability (TEER/barrier-regulating proteins/proinflammatory activation), and angiogenesis impairment (vessel branching/VEGF signaling) were evaluated. Results: Reduction of glucose and/or oxygen potentiates Amyloid-induced cerebral EC death, barrier instability, junction protein dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and angiogenesis/wound healing failure. In particular, hypoperfusion exacerbates Amyloid beta Q22-mediated cerebral EC apoptosis, TEER/ZO1 decreases, ICAM1, IL6, and IL8 upregulation, monocyte migration, and wound healing impairments. Differentially, when in combination with Amyloid beta 42, hypoperfusion more strongly potentiates cerebral EC necrosis as well as increases in MMP2, phosphorylated claudin-5, IFN gamma, and IL12p70 expression. Additionally, this study identified that GD exerts stronger effects on promoting increases in cerebral EC caspase-3 activation, apoptosis, and MMP2/ICAM1 expression, while hypoxia particularly increases necrosis, ZO1 expression, and pro-angiogenic protein expression.

H.; Vicidomini, R.; Nguyen, P.; Li, Z.", "abstract": "Kainate-type glutamate receptors and their dedicated auxiliary protein Neto function at both pre- and postsynaptic sites to regulate the activity of synaptic networks. However, attributing specific synaptic functions to Neto and/or kainate receptors is challenging. Here we focus on Drosophila KaiR1D receptors, which modulate synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junction, and elucidate the role of Neto in the regulation of autoreceptor activities and neurotransmitter release. We show that Neto- limits the presynaptic accumulation and function of KaiR1D autoreceptors in vivo. Using outside-out patch recordings, we demonstrate that Neto- modulates the KaiR1D gating properties, slowing desensitization and attenuating the block by intracellular polyamines and extracellular toxins. Neto- also promotes the axonal distribution of KaiR1D, but this function is not critical for the KaiR1D-dependent regulation of synaptic transmission. Instead, Neto- increases the KaiR1D-mediated charge transfer leading to increased neurotransmitter release. Our data demonstrate that Neto- provides multiple layers of modulation to KaiR1D autoreceptors to ensure proper neurotransmitter release. These findings also suggest that coordinated regulation of receptor function and localization represents an ancestral strategy to safeguard synaptic stability.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

However, to date, very little is known about the dynamics with which grid representations change at context transitions, or how such dynamics relate to downstream behavioral adaptation. Here we tested whether grid representations measured with fMRI rotate to match behavioral goals at context transitions and whether such rotations underlie knowledge transfer. Human participants performed a task that included unsignaled state changes at which the position of multiple target locations abruptly and synchronously rotated by the same degree. After state changes, participants were able to leverage the relative positions of the targets to rapidly infer locations, even novel ones, constituting a form of zero-shot transfer. We observed a cognitive grid-like code in the right posterior parietal cortex with a consistent phase angle that rotated with the relative positions of the targets. However, this rotation was too slow to account for rapid improvements in performance after a state change, and instead these improvements were more closely related to representations of the identity and location of spatial targets in the frontoparietal and orbitofrontal cortex, respectively. Our results highlight the ability of humans to rapidly transfer knowledge and demonstrate that a parietal grid-like code rotates into behaviorally relevant reference frames, but raise questions about the function of such rotations, pointing instead to alternate neural mechanisms for rapid knowledge transfer.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Recent large-scale magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets, using intelligence measures focused on verbal-numerical reasoning, now offer more robust opportunities for discovery. In this study (N=11,289), we showed the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as exhibiting the strongest effect size and a significant causal relationship with intelligence, where larger surface area predicts higher intelligence as revealed by Mendelian randomization analyses. Additional regions, including the orbitofrontal and temporal cortices, also showed causal links to intelligence. These regions are critical for working memory, executive function, and language. Reverse causality analyses further indicated that higher intelligence contributes to increased total surface area and greater cortical thickness in the perisylvian language region. Our findings replicate prior evidence of a bidirectional relationship between total surface area and intelligence and further offer novel insights into regional cortical associations and causal effect.

L.; Balasubramanian, H.; Isaac, J.; Young, L.; Murugan, M.", "abstract": "The ability to consider and appraise positively valenced stimuli in the environment, such as food and social interaction, to guide appropriate action is important for survival of most animals. Several studies have compared how food and social rewards are represented in different regions involved in reward processing and found either overlapping or distinct representations. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA) there seems to be opposing evidence for both shared and unique encoding of social and nonsocial stimuli. In our recent work, we found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region reciprocally connected to the BLA, has distinct social and food representations using a novel self-paced two-choice assay. Given that the BLA and mPFC play differing roles in reward processing, it is important to understand how these two nodes may differ in their encoding reward types within the same assay. To resolve how the BLA encodes social and food information, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons in female and male mice during a two-choice social-sucrose operant task. We found that BLA neurons robustly and distinctly respond to social and food reward. In contrast to the mPFC, BLA neurons did not show a bias towards social reward responsiveness and instead showed equal social/sucrose representation, in males, or a sucrose reward bias, in females. BLA neurons were sensitive to internal state - water deprivation increased the proportion of sucrose reward responsive neurons. Additionally, sucrose reward responsive BLA neurons were differentially sensitive to reward omissions, such that neurons that were excited by sucrose reward were more sensitive to reward omissions compared to those inhibited by reward. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct, heterogeneous response profiles within the BLA to social and food rewards, in a manner different from the mPFC.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Using T2-weighted fetal MRI of 68 typically developing fetuses (22-32 weeks gestational age, GA), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to quantify regional SP morphology (thickness, surface area, and volume). SP characteristics scaled strongly with GA and residual brain volume and showed marked regional differences. After correcting for geometric confounds, regional variation of SP thickness persisted, with highest values in parietal and perisylvian regions, suggesting that SP thickness may serve as a sensitive marker of intrinsic developmental differences. Between late 2nd and early 3rd trimester, mean SP thickness increased by 39.2% with large variation across regions (11.0 SD), whereas surface area growth was more uniform (64.3%, 0.7 SD). Continuous growth trajectories clustered into distinct spatiotemporal profiles: early-developing regions (e.g., pericentral and medial occipital cortices) contrasted with later-developing regions (prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices). These patterns partially recapitulate primary-to-association, medial-to-lateral, and posterior-to-anterior maturational hierarchies, pointing to organized developmental program. SP development also showed region-specific hemispheric asymmetries, including leftward thickness and volume asymmetry in superior temporal and precentral gyri. Some asymmetries amplified, others attenuated or reversed with age, suggesting both transient states and potential precursors of postnatal lateralization. Together, these findings provide a framework for regional SP quantification and position SP morphology, particularly thickness, as a promising early biomarker that might link fetal SP changes to subsequent cortical development and neurodevelopmental outcomes.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Using resident intruder assays in male and female Swiss Webster mice, we combined iDISCO+ cFos imaging with a weighted co-expression network analyses to identify mesoscale co-activation modules in aggressive (AGG) vs. non-aggressive (NON) animals. We performed a module preservation analysis between each phenotype within each sex followed by differential correlation to localize edge-level changes. Behaviorally, AGG mice spent more time attacking, while females showed greater social investigation. Network analyses revealed that NON networks often preserved density of AGG modules, but connectivity reorganized with aggression. In male AGGs there was large spread reorganization of numerous modules: a large sensorimotor subcortical blue module, a pallidal/hypothalamic/brainstem yellow module, and a brainstem-heavy green module. Surprisingly the brown module, enriched for classic social-behavior regions was moderately preserved in male NONs. In females, the turquoise module spanning somatosensory/interoceptive cortex and midbrain regions and the brown sensory cortex/amygdala module were the least preserved. These results indicate that aggression recruits distributed mesoscale communities via edge-specific gain, with males displaying broad strengthening along a cortex/basal ganglia/ hypothalamus/brainstem axis and females showing more targeted potentiation within sensory/arousal modules.

To address this, we used two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of anesthetized mice during presentation of natural ultrasonic vocalizations. Our aim was to compare astrocytic responses with those of neighboring neurons and to determine whether astrocytes exhibit feature-selective receptive fields. Event detection showed that astrocytic calcium activity is highly heterogeneous, but only a minority of events were consistently stimulus-linked. To examine this stimulus-driven subset, we estimated receptive field features using maximum noise entropy modeling and compared them with those of concurrently recorded neurons. Despite qualitative similarities in receptive-field features, analysis of modulation spectra and principal angles showed that astrocytic and neuronal receptive fields overlap but occupy distinct regions of feature space. This indicates that astrocytes and neurons encode partially shared, but not identical, dimensions of the sensory stimulus. Our findings indicate that astrocytes encode diverse sensory features, providing an additional contribution to neuronal encoding. This suggests that astrocytic calcium activity is not simply a reflection of neuronal firing, but instead represents a distinct component of cortical sensory processing.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Accurate channel pruning is therefore essential but approaches vary and often use adult-derived thresholds, risking unnecessary data loss. Aim This work systematically compared pruning approaches and parameter choices to evaluate their effects on data quality and retention in infant fNIRS. Approach Data from 5-24 month-old infants were collected across two cohorts, using two paradigms. Channel pruning was performed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the Quality Testing of Near Infrared Scans (QT-NIRS) tool, varying key thresholds. Multilevel models assessed effects of pruning method, parameter choice, age, motion, and testing site on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channels retained. Results QT-NIRS produced significantly higher SNR than CV pruning across nearly all age, task, and cohort combinations, when matched for data retention. Higher QT-NIRS thresholds improved quality but reduced retention. Motion prevalence strongly reduced both SNR and retention; testing site and age had smaller but notable effects. Conclusions QT-NIRS offers a better balance of data quality and retention than CV pruning. Lower QT-NIRS thresholds than adult defaults are recommended for infant data. These findings provide practical guidance for preprocessing pipelines in developmental fNIRS research.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

While dopaminergic (DAergic) input is known to modulate LEC function, how aging impacts this circuitry remains unclear. Here, we used two viral labeling strategies to investigate projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the LEC. First, we employed an INTRSECT dual-recombinase approach in TH-Flp::VGLUT2-Cre mice to selectively label dopamine-only (DA-only) and dopamine-glutamate co-releasing (DA-GLU) neurons. Next, we used a DAT-Cre-driven ChR2-YFP strategy to broadly label all DA axons. We found that both DA-only and DA-GLU populations innervate the LEC. With age, we observed a selective reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) signal within DA axons in the LEC, despite preserved axonal structure as revealed by YFP labeling. VGLUT2 signal within DA-GLU terminals appeared less affected. In the VTA, TH+ neuron density declined with age, with distinct spatial patterns along the anterior-posterior axis. These findings reveal an age-related vulnerability of DAergic projections to the LEC and suggest a circuit-level mechanism may contribute to memory impairments in aging.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Here we use monosynaptic viral tracing in transgenic mice to quantitively define the organization of pallidostriatal connectivity. We show that FoxP2-expressing arkypallidal neurons provide the greatest input to the striatum, primarily targeting indirect pathway spiny projection neurons and cholinergic interneurons. In contrast, prototypic pallidal neurons, defined by Nkx2-1 expression, preferentially innervate parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. These data reveal a structured and selective organization of pallidostriatal projections, suggesting that distinct classes of pallidal neurons modulate striatal circuits through complementary pathways.

While rhythmic cues can improve several parameters in some clinical populations, they do alter the long-range autocorrelations naturally exhibited in series of stride durations. However, transitions between walking with and without a metronome (and vice versa) have not been measured; it is therefore unclear how people adapt to such a change in task. To address this gap, a total of 21 healthy volunteers were asked to walk overground under three conditions: one unconstrained control condition, followed by two conditions in which a metronome was activated during either the first or second half of the trial to test both transitions. The long-range autocorrelations were assessed over a sliding window on the stride series to measure their evolution. Our observations were reproduced with a computational model allowing us to relate sudden changes in movement parameters to the long-range autocorrelations, which are typically measured over longer timescales. The results showed a clear transition in both conditions involving a metronome, with long-range autocorrelations of the series of stride durations gradually reduced when the metronome was turned on and recovered when it was turned off. In these two conditions, the change in long-range autocorrelations could be reproduced in the model by an instantaneous switching of the control policy associated with the presence or not of the metronome, suggesting that long-range autocorrelations emerge from a flexible control strategy that rapidly regulates timing and amplitude parameters according to task requirements.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

The genus Bradyrhizobium includes bacteria able to symbiotically nodulate the roots of soybean (Glycine max), providing the plant with a direct source of biologically fixed nitrogen. Optimizing this symbiosis can minimize the use of nitrogen fertilizers and make soybean production more sustainable. Phages targeting Bradyrhizobium may modify their hosts' genotype, alter phenotypic traits such as symbiotic effectiveness, and mediate competition among strains for nodulation sites. Sixteen phages were isolated against B. elkanii strains USDA94 and USDA31, and B. diazoefficiens strain USDA110. Comparative analyses revealed host species-dependent diversity in morphology, host range, and genome composition, leading to the identification of three previously undescribed phage species. Remarkably, all B. elkanii phages shared a siphophage morphology and formed a single species with >97% nucleotide identity, even when isolated from farms separated by up to ~70 km, suggesting genomic stability across geographic scales. In contrast, phages isolated against B. diazoefficiens displayed podophage-like morphology, greater genetic diversity, and divided into two distinct species. Although no phages were recovered against B. japonicum strains or native Delaware Bradyrhizobium isolates tested, some Delaware isolates showed susceptibility during the host range assay. The phage genomes demonstrated features predicting phenotypes. Terminase genes predicted headful packaging among the phages which is critical for generalized transduction. The B. elkanii phages all carried tmRNA genes capable of recruiting stalled ribosomes and both phage groups carried DNA polymerase A indicating greater control of phage genome replication.

AtxA has two DNA-binding Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH) domains, two phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system regulatory domains (PRD1 and PRD2), and a putative EIIB domain (a component of PTS sugar transport EII-complexes). Previous studies showed that glucose and CO2 increase AtxA-dependent toxin gene transcription, along with histidine phosphorylation of PRD1 and PRD2. Our transcriptional profiling of virulence factors, PA secretion, and fluorescent reporter strain analyses confirms a synergistic effect of glucose and CO2 on AtxA-dependent toxin production. Deletion of AtxA ({Delta}atxA) significantly reduced glucose uptake in bacteria, suggesting that AtxA may act within the glucose-PTS system. Mutation analysis of the EIIB domain of AtxA identified the cysteine at position 402 as essential for the transcriptional activity of AtxA. Deletion of glucose PTS permease PtsG ({Delta}ptsG) significantly reduced the expression of PA, LF, and EF. Loss of PtsG also caused attenuation in a mouse model of infection. Intracellular imaging using FLIM confirms a physical interaction of PtsG and AtxA through EIIB domain of AtxA. Using phosphomimetic and phosphoablative mutants of AtxA, we confirmed that the physical interaction of PtsG and AtxA is essential for AtxA activity. Finally, the synergy between glucose and CO2 was targeted by deleting pyruvate carboxylase Pyc ({Delta}pyc), which regulates anaplerosis. This deletion confirms that Pyc stimulates the level of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and increases the phosphorelay in glucose-PTS to enhance AtxA activity. Therefore, we propose that a histidine-phosphorelay from PEP regulates AtxA via PTS enzymatic activity, impacting AtxA activity through physical interaction of AtxA and PtsG. Finally, we propose AtxA as an integral component of the glucose-PTS, where transcriptional activity of AtxA is regulated by environmental signals including glucose and CO2.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Current therapies often fail to fully address these cellular alterations in smokers, highlighting a need for innovative therapeutic and generative approaches. Objective: This study explores the therapeutic potential of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), a blood-derived product, to modulate nicotine-induced biological activities in primary gingival fibroblasts. It aims at understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms and assessing the efficacy of PRP as an adjunct treatment for periodontitis in smokers. Methods: Gingival fibroblasts were treated with increasing concentrations of nicotine, which led to senescence and autophagy. Subsequent treatment with autologous PRP was evaluated for its effect on the reversion of these processes, by measuring cell migration and proliferation, metabolic activity, as well as by looking at senescence and autophagic markers. A Caenorhabditis elegans model of autophagy was used to assess nicotine and PRP biological activities in an in vivo environment. Results: Nicotine at high concentrations triggered cellular vacuolization, a decrease in metabolism, viability and proliferation that was partially (with 500 ng/ml nicotine) or completely (with 250 ng/ml nicotine) reversed by a concomitant treatment with 10% PRP. Nicotine alone (250 ng/ml) slightly enhanced migration, while concomitant treatment between nicotine and PRP significantly increased their migration potential. In Caenorhabditis elegans, PRP reduced the nicotine-induced autophagic activity, as evidenced by decreased numbers of autophagosome and a higher number of viable worms during adulthood in comparison to nicotine control conditions. A screening of gingival fibroblast secretome revealed a modulation of autophagy-related cytokines in response to nicotine and/or PRP. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that PRP could effectively inhibit nicotine-induced autophagy gingival fibroblasts, offering insights into its possible use as a therapeutic tool for managing periodontitis in smokers. The study underscores the potential of PRP in altering disease progression by modulating key cellular processes affected by smoking.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We investigated how urban development affects the genetic composition and structure of caracals (Caracal caracal) in Cape Town, South Africa using microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequence data. Sampling across four geographically disparate urban and rural populations revealed contrasting temporal patterns: mitochondrial markers indicated historical genetic connectivity among populations, while microsatellite data demonstrated recent genetic structuring driven primarily by urbanization. An extensively isolated urban population showed reduced allelic richness and pronounced genetic differentiation, reflecting urbanization as a strong barrier to gene flow. Within the isolated urban population, GPS-collared caracals demonstrated a degree of spatial genetic organization, with related individuals maintaining significantly higher home range overlap despite inhabiting a severely fragmented urban landscape. This kin-structured space use occurred despite caracals in the system having large home ranges compressed within a relatively small, isolated environment. Our findings reveal that urbanization has rapidly disrupted gene flow in this otherwise geographically widespread and adaptable carnivore, imposing a sufficient barrier to generate detectable genetic consequences within contemporary timeframes. The contrasting signals from historical versus contemporary molecular markers highlight urbanization's role in fragmenting previously connected populations and demonstrates the value of multi-marker approaches for detecting anthropogenic impacts on wildlife populations.

This suggests that the assembly captures ~88% of the X. umbellata genome, and the relatively high heterozygosity may indicate introduction from a genetically diverse wild population. Completeness was further supported by BUSCO analysis (anthozoa_odb12 lineage), which identified 91.4% complete and 3.9% fragmented BUSCOs. Furthermore, 555,596 sequences were identified as belonging to Symbiodiniaceae, of which 99.97% (n= 555,520) aligned to a Durusdinium reference genome, suggesting that the co-invading symbiont belongs to the genus Durusdinium. Establishing these genomic and symbiotic resources at an early stage of invasion provides a critical foundation for monitoring range expansion, investigating host-symbiont evolutionary dynamics, and identifying genomic features that may underlie the invasive potential of X. umbellata as it spreads across Puerto Rico and the wider Caribbean.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

To explore this, we employed the adrenal cortex as a model system given its stereotypical spatial organization and the important role {beta}Cat plays in homeostasis and disease. For example, excessive production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex (primary aldosteronism, PA) constitutes a significant cause of cardiovascular morbidity, which has been associated with {beta}Cat gain-of-function ({beta}Cat-GOF). Adherens junctions (AJs) connect the actin cytoskeletons of adjacent zona Glomerulosa (zG) cells via a cadherin/{beta}Cat/ -Catenin (Cat) complex and mediate aldosterone production. Whether {beta}Cat-GOF drives zG hyperplasia, a key feature of PA, via AJs is unknown. Here, we show that aldosterone secretagogues (K+, AngII) and {beta}Cat-GOF mediate AJ enrichment via Rho-ROCK-actomyosin signaling. In addition, Rho-ROCK inhibition leads to altered zG rosette morphology and decreased aldosterone production. Mice with zG-specific {beta}Cat-GOF demonstrate increased AJ formation and zG hyperplasia, which was blunted by Rho-ROCK inhibition and deletion of Cat. Further, analysis of human aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) revealed high levels of {beta}Cat expression were associated with increased membranous expression of K-Cadherin.

We present the Generalized Eigenvalue De-Artifacting Instrument (GEDAI), a novel algorithm for denoising highly contaminated EEG. GEDAI employs leadfield filtering to selectively remove noise and artifacts that diverge from a theoretically defined EEG forward model. This approach offers unique advantages over existing solutions, including 1) denoising of highly corrupt recordings without clean reference data, 2) single-step correction of artifactual epochs and bad channels, 3) unsupervised detection of brain and noise components based on the signal and noise subspace alignment index (SENSAI). In ground-truth simulations with synthetic and empirical EEG contaminated with realistic artifacts (EOG, EMG, noise), GEDAI globally outperformed leading denoising techniques based on principal component analysis (ASR) and independent component analysis (IClabel, MARA), revealing large effect sizes in challenging scenarios with simultaneous artifact mixtures, low signal-to-noise ratio (-9 dB), and high temporal contamination (up to 100%). Its superior denoising also enhanced neurobehavioral predictions, yielding highest accuracies in ERP classification and brain fingerprinting. GEDAIs autonomy, computational speed and noise-resilience could find future applications in 1) real-world medical, mobile and dry electrode EEG recordings 2) magnetoenecephalography (MEG) denoising (given the shared M/EEG forward model), and 3) real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

Despite their ability to bind closed chromatin, pioneer factors occupy distinct binding sites in different tissues. The pioneer factor Zelda promotes the undifferentiated fate in both the early Drosophila embryo and in the neural stem cells (neuroblasts) of the larval brain. Tissue-specific binding by Zelda identifies cell-type specific enhancers, which are enriched for different DNA-sequence motifs. We investigated the features that promoted cell-type specific occupancy by testing the role of conserved, structured protein domains in the capacity of Zelda to promote the embryonic and neuroblast cell fates. We unexpectedly identified that the most deeply conserved region in Zelda, the second zinc finger, has opposing functions in the embryo and neuroblasts. We showed that this zinc finger is a previously unrecognized DNA-binding domain that is specifically required for Zelda binding to a G-rich motif in larval neuroblasts. The pioneering function of Zelda depends largely on the C-terminal cluster of zinc fingers that promotes binding in the early embryo, suggesting that pioneer function may depend on how Zelda engages the genome. As opposed to co-factor expression or chromatin environment, our data identify tissue-specific usage of two, widely separated DNA-binding domains as the mechanism controlling tissue-specific binding and activity.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we aimed to identify therapeutically targetable vulnerabilities in MDS/AML with SRSF2 mutations. Ex vivo drug-sensitivity testing of bone marrow cells from AML patients and healthy donors showed that SRSF2-mutant cells are sensitive to inhibitors of CHK1, and WEE1 DNA damage response (DDR) kinases. To test causality, we engineered isogenic K562 cell line clones expressing SRSF2P95H/L/R mutations. RNA sequencing confirmed splicing aberrations characteristic of MDS/AML in these clones. We found that SRSF2P95H/L/R sensitize leukemia cells to ATR-CHK1-WEE1 inhibition. Bone marrow progenitors from Srsf2P95H and U2AF1S34F knock-in mice showed heightened sensitivity to CHK1 inhibition, corroborating the human data. In contrast, RUNX1 mutations were linked to resistance against CHK1 and WEE1 inhibition in SRSF2-mutant AML samples. Runx1 loss also caused resistance to CHK1 inhibitors in knock-in mouse progenitors harboring Srsf2P95H or U2AF1S34F, indicating that RUNX1 loss is a mechanism of resistance. In conclusion, SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations are biomarkers of sensitivity to ATR-CHK1 pathway inhibitors, while RUNX1 mutations cause resistance.

Here, using a physiologically relevant neuron-astrocyte co-culture system that recapitulates tripartite synapse architecture, we show that astrocytes actively process and propagate -syn aggregates. Astrocytes internalize -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) and cleave them into C-terminally truncated, seeding-competent species via the lysosomal protease Cathepsin D (CtsD). These truncated species are subsequently transferred to neurons, where they promote the growth of Lewy neurite (LN)-like aggregates. Notably, -syn PFF exposure disrupts lysosomal membrane integrity in astrocytes, leading to CtsD upregulation. These findings reveal a feed-forward mechanism in which astrocytic lysosomal dysfunction amplifies -syn pathogenicity. Our findings identify astrocytes as active contributors to -syn propagation and highlight the astrocytic lysosomal pathway as a potential therapeutic target in PD.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Recent studies indicate that neutrophils, particularly neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), contribute to the development and progression of APS. However, the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: To address this, we analyzed epigenome and transcriptome data to identify key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of neutrophils in APS using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Two datasets (GSE102215 and GSE124565) were obtained from the GEO database. The Limma R package was used to identify DEGs, while ChAMP R was applied to analyze differentially methylated genes (DMGs) between APS patients and healthy controls. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was performed using ClusterProfiler, and TISIDB was used to examine associations with immunomodulators, chemokines, and receptors. GeneCards and Connectivity Map databases were further used for disease-related gene analysis and drug prediction. Results: GO enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were primarily enriched in leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, regulation of leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Correspondingly, KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated that DEGs were mainly enriched in the ribosome, NF-kB signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and other related pathways. Through WGCNA analysis, we identified two key intersection genes, CCL5 and ITK, which were positively correlated with CD8+ T cells and eosinophils, while being negatively correlated with neutrophils and follicular helper T cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that CCL5 was enriched in hematopoietic cell lineage, ribosome, and ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, and ITK was enriched in ribosome, ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, and T-cell receptor signaling. Similarly, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) showed that CCL5 and ITK were associated with IL-2-STAT5 signaling and the P53 pathway as well as MTORC1 signaling. Furthermore, gene regulatory network analysis suggested that CCL5 and ITK are modulated by common mechanisms involving multiple transcription factors. By examining APS-related genes in the GeneCards database, we observed a significant negative correlation between CCL5 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (R = -0.624), and a strong positive correlation between ITK and CD40LG (R = 0.933). Finally, drug perturbation expression profiles revealed that RS-56812, acebutolol, emetine, and proscillaridin exhibited the most significant negative correlation with disease-associated expression profiles. Conclusion: These data nominate CCL5 and ITK as APS-associated genes in neutrophils and indicate associations with multiple signaling pathways.

Although several studies have described the components of the chlamydial divisome necessary to generate peptidoglycan at a specific site on the membrane, less is understood about how the peptidoglycan structure is degraded to allow for the daughter cell to form and the division process to complete. Amidases are key components of the cell wall in model system bacteria as they catalyze the degradation and remodeling of peptidoglycan, including in the division septum. Here, we characterized the cell division-associated amidase, AmiA_Ct, of Chlamydia trachomatis both in vitro and in vivo. Our in vitro data show that AmiA_Ct is a bona fide, metal-dependent amidase capable of cleaving peptidoglycan. AmiA_Ct complemented an E. coli amidase deficient strain and supported the growth and separation of daughter cells. To assess the function of AmiA_Ct in C. trachomatis, we generated a transformant strain carrying an inducible CRISPR interference system targeting the amiA gene. Knocking down expression of amiA resulted in altered bacterial morphology, a reduction in infectious EBs, and the accumulation of peptidoglycan in the organisms.

While extensively studied in diverse organisms, their influence on viral ecology remains largely unexplored. This study takes the temporal dynamics of viruses in Daya Bay as an example to uncover the rhythmic control of viral replication and activity. Using a high-resolution time-series dataset collected every 2 hours over a 3-day period, we identified a total of 22,151 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) and 414 Nucleocytoplasmic Large DNA Virus (NCLDV) genomes. Our analysis revealed significant diel fluctuations, with 14.48% of vOTUs exhibiting diel patterns in metagenomic abundance and 1.97% showing diel transcriptional activity. We found that these abundant diel viruses infect hosts across the domains of life, including cyanobacteria, pelagibacteria, Marine Group II (MGII) archaea and protists, all known for their diel metabolism. The expanded spectrum of host diversity with diel viral interactions significantly broadens our understanding of virus-host rhythmic dynamics in natural environmental settings. A strong positive correlation was detected between the transcriptional activities of these diel viruses and their respective hosts. Contrary to bacteriophages, which mostly peaked during the day, we demonstrated that NCLDVs showed nocturnal diel abundance with a co-fluctuating diel transcriptomic activity pattern tightly hitched to their hosts, peaking at night and declining during the day. Furthermore, we identified a rich compendium of viral genes with significant diel expression patterns, including those related to structural protein production, DNA replication, and stress response. Notably, several essential viral genes involved in stress response and repair were found to be diel transcribed for the first time, including UV-endonuclease (UvdE), peroxidase, chaperones, and early light-induced protein (ELIP).

Rhizobial strains differentially influenced the effect of drought on legume ecophysiological traits. Certain strains increased photosynthesis and enhanced photoprotection under drought. Moreover, legumes under drought and herbivore exposure also exhibited increased photoprotection. Some strains were observed to limit herbivore growth rates under drought more effectively than others. A multivariate trait analysis revealed that strains differentially influenced legume trait syndromes and plasticity in response to stress in certain environments. Rhizobial strain variation was a key driver of tripartite interactions through changes in plant trait expression and plasticity under simultaneous abiotic and biotic stress, which had cascading effects on insect herbivore growth. A community approach incorporating multiple beneficial microbial strains may be effective for managing legume-rhizobia symbioses and introducing functional trait diversity and resistance traits into ecosystems.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

For instance, fishing bans, aimed at enhancing fish biodiversity in eastern China, may counteract the effectiveness of nutrient control measures in mitigating eutrophication. This study employs a dual modeling approach to evaluate this hypothesis in Lake Hongze, the fourth largest shallow lake in China. The PCLake model was calibrated using observational data from Lake Hongze collected between 2016 and 2020. The calibrated model was subsequently applied in a hindcast analysis from 2020 to 2024 and a forecast simulation from 2025 to 2030 to assess the impacts of fishing bans. Combined with structural equation modeling (SEM) path analysis, the results support the hypothesis that fishing bans can exhibit antagonistic effects on nutrient loading control by enhancing top-down regulation relative to bottom-up processes. Specifically, the fishing ban led to increased fish biomass, phytoplankton abundance, and nutrient levels over the past four years, while reducing the abundance of submerged macrophytes, zoobenthos, and zooplankton. Projections further indicate that such antagonistic effects would persist through 2030 if the fishing ban remains in place as planned. Additionally, model forecasts suggest that even with adjustments to the duration and intensity of fishing bans, antagonistic effects could be amplified under more stringent nutrient control scenarios. This study provides valuable insights into maximizing the net benefits of combined environmental management strategies through a systematic framework that evaluates both the effects and underlying processes of different interventions.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Moreover, target-specific resistance (TSR) and non-target-specific resistance (NTSR) surge have influenced the lead compounds bio-discovery over the past decades. To date, prior researches are limited to basic efficacy tests and conventional extraction protocol. Therefore, the study was designed to assess the anthelmintic potency of 19 tannin-free natural products (NPs) induced alterations of neurotransmission in C. elegans. The anthelmintic activity was assessed by examining the motility (head thrashes and body bends), mortality, egg hatch inhibition (EHI) and expression of cat-1, ser-1, dat-1, and tba-1 genes. Eleven (11) plant extracts, Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Cassia alata L., Portulaca oleracea L., Saraca asoca (Roxb.) W.J.de Wilde, Eleusine indica L. Gaertn., Persicaria hydropiper L.

Persicaria hydropiper L. Delarbre @ 1mg/mL, caused the lowest body bending (31{+/-}1.7, p<0.01), while Eleusine indica L. Gaertn. reduced head thrashing (66.3{+/-}3.0, p<0.01). L. usitatissimum L. exhibited the highest lethality (87.3{+/-}1.8%, p<0.01) and the LD50 values of Eleusine indica L. Gaertn. (0.40mg/mL) and Linum usitatissimum L. (0.411mg/mL) were the lowest. Interestingly, C. infortunatum L. exhibited the strongest EHI (97.5{+/-}3.0%, p<0.01). Gene expression analysis revealed a significant down-regulation of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathway indicating the metabolic and reproductive disruptions. This pioneering study underscores the anthelmintic potency of native plant extracts, highlighting their neuromodulatory and developmental impact on C. elegans.

However, the factors limiting their spontaneous recruitment remain unclear. Using multi-omics techniques, we identified impaired myelopoiesis and monocyte development in both mice and AD patients. While not the primary cause of the disease, this impairment is associated with disease progression. In the 5xFAD mouse model, monocyte differentiation was found to be disrupted due to a maladaptive bone marrow (BM) response, driven by type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. A similar phenotype was found in circulating monocytes from AD patients compared to healthy controls. Blocking IFN-I with monoclonal antibodies or using chimeric AD mice with BM from mice lacking the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) alleviated myelopoiesis dysfunction, normalized monocyte phenotypes, and reduced cognitive impairment. These improvements in myeloid function were accompanied by an increased homing of monocyte-derived macrophages in the AD brain.

K.", "abstract": "Competitive interactions between distinct groups or \"teams\" are ubiquitous across complex systems, from gene regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions to political coalitions, economic markets, and social networks. While binary competition (two-team systems) dominates in biological contexts, multi-team competition is more common in social and economic domains, raising fundamental questions about the stability and reliability of different competitive architectures. Here, we systematically analyze the dynamics of multi-team competitive networks using Boolean modeling of signed directed graphs, extending well-characterized two-team gene regulatory networks to systems with three or more mutually inhibitory teams. Our results demonstrate that three-team networks produce significantly less stable outcomes than two-team systems, with steady states exhibiting higher \"frustration\" (structural imbalance) and increased sensitivity to perturbations. Multi-team systems show unpredictable state transitions even under controlled perturbations, particularly at lower network densities typical of real-world systems. Networks with four or more teams cannot maintain entirely distinct stable states. Using spectral analysis of the network adjacency matrices, we show that team structure can be predicted from eigenvector properties, extending structural balance theory to signed directed networks. These findings have broad implications across domains: in biology, they explain the evolutionary preference for binary cell-fate decisions and suggest why multi-fate systems are rare and unreliable. In social and political contexts, they provide insight into coalition instability and the tendency toward two-party systems. In economic networks, they illuminate the challenges of maintaining stable multi-competitor markets.

P.", "abstract": "Objective: Delineating the nodal control points that maintain whole-body energy homeostasis is critical for understanding potential treatments of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. The nutrient-sensing transcription factor MondoA is a regulator of skeletal muscle fuel storage, where muscle-specific inhibition improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. However, the role of MondoA in whole body energy metabolic homeostasis is not understood. Methods: Generalized MondoA knockout (gKO) mice were generated and assessed for glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, body composition, energy expenditure, cold tolerance, and tissue specific transcriptional changes in response to high fat diet. Complementary studies in cultured human adipocytes assessed the impact of MondoA deficiency on substrate utilization and lipolysis. Results: gKO mice are protected from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, through increased whole body energy expenditure. gKO mice exhibit reduced brown and inguinal white adipose tissue mass, without evidence of beiging. The gKO mice are hyperlactatemic and isolated MondoA-deficient adipocytes have increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake and glycolytic function. Lastly, gKO mice and KO adipocytes display increased circulating glycerol relative to free fatty acids in response to adrenergic stimulus consistent with elevated re-esterification. However, this phenotype is not recapitulated in adipocyte-specific KO mice. Conclusions: MondoA deficiency alters cellular sensing of nutrient availability and storage/utilization mechanisms. In the whole-body setting, this results in increased energy expenditure, potentially related to increased glucose uptake and glycolytic flux driving glycerol synthesis to supply high rates of lipolysis and lipid re-esterification. These results suggest that MondoA functions to maintain fuel storage and when lost, inter-organ futile cycling ensues.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We hypothesised that colour is not only central to perception but also a rich and decodable source of information in electroencephalography (EEG) signal recorded non-invasively from the scalp. Previous work has shown that brain activity carries colour information for uniform patches, but it remains unclear whether this extends to natural, complex images where colour is not explicitly cued. To investigate this, we analysed the THINGS EEG dataset, comprising 64-channel recordings from participants viewing 1,800 distinct objects (16,740 images) for 100 ms each, totalling over 82,000 trials. We established a perceptual colour ground truth through a psychophysical experiment in which participants viewed each image for 100 ms and selected perceived colours from a 13-option palette. An artificial neural network trained to predict these scene-level colour distributions directly from EEG signals showed that colour information was robustly decodable (average F-score of 0.5). We next modelled the interaction between colour and object perception in neuroimaging decoding. Images were segmented using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), each object was assigned a representative colour, and features were extracted from these colour-augmented images using CLIP vision encoders. We trained an EEG encoder, CUBE (ColoUr and oBjEct decoding), to align features in both object and colour spaces. Across EEG and MEG datasets in a 200-class recognition task, incorporating colour improved decoding accuracy by about 5%.

The connectivity patterns were synthesised using generalised additive models and indicated that latitude explained significantly more variation in connectivity than elevation. The range shifts of plants were primarily constrained by dispersal limitation rather than by the availability of suitable future habitat. Under conservative dispersal, connectivity remained stagnant despite climate change whereas optimistic dispersal fundamentally reshaped connectivity patterns, creating new pathways that aligned with areas of habitat gain. These findings demonstrate that the capacity of tropical plants to track climate change is critically dependent on hornbills, highlighting the urgent need to conserve both frugivore populations and landscape connectivity to ensure ecosystem resilience.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We then leveraged community science data to reveal patterns and potential drivers of phytoplasma occurrence across the range of white trillium. Within populations, we found that phytoplasma infection presence was more likely in low host density plots, where insect vectors occupied a higher proportion of trillium, indicative of an encounter-dilution effect. Leafhoppers in the genus Empoasca are the likely vectors of Candidatus Phytoplasma pruni-related, group 16SrIII infections between trillium. Phytoplasma was widely distributed across trillium's range, even at range edges, and probability of infection was significantly reduced by hotter summer temperatures and increased by proximity to cropland.

One possibility is that this continuous flow is enabled by a seamless stream of cortical activity. However, emerging evidence suggests that even during ongoing behaviors, cortical neural populations undergo brief periods of silence. This 'off-state' can be detected as wake slow waves in EEG, similar to the slow waves characterizing deep sleep. Here, we leveraged the spontaneously occurring fluctuations in smartphone touchscreen interactions in combination with EEG to investigate the dynamics of slow waves during behavior. We report that wake slow waves occur more frequently during a session of smartphone behavior than during a session of prolonged rest (~1 h). We find that slow waves can occur in bursts - characterized by short consecutive intervals - interleaved with longer periods of absent slow waves. During smartphone use, the probability of bursts increased compared to rest, and the duration of burst-absent periods decreased. During the bursts, however, the likelihood of generating smartphone interactions was substantially diminished. Conversely, the periods of absent slow waves were more permissive to the behavioral output. We speculate that the dynamics of neural silencing are configured according to the overall behavioral state. This configuration, in turn, allows behavioral outputs to leverage the windows of opportunity that emerge between slow wave bursts.

C.", "abstract": "Patients with chronic neuropathic pain typically experience affective symptoms that drive reduced quality of life and negatively impact pain management. Mesolimbic dopamine is necessary for reward valuation and learning, and the existence of a hypodopaminergic state has been proposed to underlie these affective symptoms of chronic pain. However, direct functional evidence for this hypodopaminergic state is lacking, and the mechanisms underlying its emergence over the acute to chronic pain transition are unknown. Here, we find a selective deficit in the ability of mesolimbic dopamine neurons to sustain burst firing, which is apparent uniquely at chronic timepoints following neuropathic injury. As a result, animals are unable to sustain effortful pursuit of rewards under conditions of high effort or time costs. Convergent biophysical modeling and experimental electrophysiology establish that in a spared nerve injury (SNI) model of chronic neuropathic pain, calcium-activated, small-conductance potassium (SK) channel function is impaired, resulting in lower peak firing and earlier entry into depolarization block of mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Critically, dopamine dependent reward learning, formation of cue-reward associations and locomotor activity remain intact, arguing against the interpretation of a generalized hypodopaminergic state. These results elucidate a circuit-level basis for selective motivational deficits emerging in chronic neuropathic pain.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

The VTA contains dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons that both play roles in reward prediction, aversion, motivated reward behavior, etc. Synaptic plasticity, including VTA excitatory and inhibitory long-term potentiation (LTP/iLTP) and long-term depression (LTD/iLTD), are fundamentally involved in processing reward learning and memory, which is maladaptively altered by abused drugs mediating dependence induction. This report extends our prior research of the understudied VTA GABA cells and the rationale for their bipotential plasticity (iLTP or iLTD) capacity by optogenetic circuit level examination of their unique GABAergic inputs. In addition, we examine potential cocaine impact on both plasticity forms. Optogenetic activation of either lateral hypothalamus or rostromedial tegmental nucleus induced iLTP in VTA GABA cells, while optogenetic activation of local VTA GABAergic inputs induced iLTD. This suggests expression of bipotential plasticity is input specific, and highlights implications for each type of plasticity on reward signaling. Drug of abuse cocaine eliminated iLTD while sparing iLTP, suggesting selective impairment of local GABA signaling to VTA GABA cells by cocaine versus projection GABA signaling. This emphasizes potential differential VTA GABA cell plasticity in reward processing and the need to further examine cocaine impact on inhibitory signaling in addition to known impact on the dopaminergic system. By elucidating the circuit-dependence of plasticity type in VTA GABA cells and drug-induced impact, our research could potentially identify additional targets for therapeutic intervention of drug dependence via the GABAergic system.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

To replicate biological perception, two approaches have emerged: artificial nervous systems that utilize soft electronics as biomimetic receptors to convert external stimuli into frequency-encoded signals, and biohybrid solutions that integrate living cells, plants, or even live animals with electronic components to decode environmental cues for life-like sensations. However, most current biohybrid approaches for artificial sensation are based on eukaryotic cells, which suffer from slow growth, stringent culture conditions, environmental susceptibility, and short lifespans, thus limiting their integration into practical wearables or robotic sensory skins. Here, we introduce fungi-based printable \"Mycoelectronics\", which are created by additive bioprinting of living fungal mycelium networks onto stretchable electronics, as a practical living thermo-responsive sensory platform. This Mycoelectronics approach leverages fungi's capacity for rapid biological responsiveness, cultivability with exponential growth, stability and self-healing in ambient conditions, bioprintability for scalable manufacturing, and mechanical flexibility for seamless integration with soft electronics. Critically, we discovered that the thermal responsiveness of the fungal network arises from intrinsic cellular processes, specifically, heat-induced vacuole remodeling and fusion, which modulate ionic transport and thus the electrical conductivity of the mycelial cells and networks, enabling a rapid temperature response. By bridging the gap between cell biology and soft electronics, the Mycoelectronics device with a living mycelium network functions as a thermal sensation system with rapid response and intrinsic self-healing properties, autonomously restoring sensing capabilities after damage or autonomously establishing sensor pathways in hard-to-reach locations. Furthermore, by integrating fungal thermal sensing with electronic circuits, we established a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc that can actuate muscles and initiate diverse actions, suggesting promising applications in future neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We examined 16 of the ~40 pairs of stomach muscles and found that warming consistently hyperpolarized muscle fibers (~10 mV per 10 {degrees}C) and reduced excitatory junctional potentials and currents. Voltage-clamp analysis in the gastric muscle 5b (gm5b) revealed a temperature-activated conductance with a reversal potential near the potassium reversal potential, consistent with a potassium current, and insensitive to tetraethylammonium. Quantitative RT-PCR identified expression of two putative two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels in these muscles. Muscle responses were also strongly influenced by extracellular pH. We observed an optimal operating window between pH 6.7-8.8; outside this range, responses diminished and abnormal activity, including spontaneous firing, appeared. Voltage-clamp recordings confirmed pH modulation of the same potassium conductance. Together, these results demonstrate that muscle excitability in Cancer borealis is shaped by temperature- and pH-sensitive currents, presumably carried by K2P channels. Functionally, these channels provide a plausible mechanism for stabilizing neuromuscular output despite environmental perturbations. As temperature increases, the pyloric and gastric rhythms accelerate, increasing synaptic drive to muscles. Activation of K2P channels counterbalances this input by reducing excitability, thereby preventing over-contraction and extending its dynamic range. This work highlights a muscle-intrinsic contribution to the well-known robustness of the stomatogastric system and identifies K2P channels as key players in adapting motor performance to changing environments.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

However, SARS-CoV-2 could introduce mutations in the viral proteins to confer resistance to antivirals. Thus, screening for drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2 mutants and elucidating their resistant mechanisms are critical for guiding the selection of effective antiviral therapies. Here, we utilized a luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc WT) to safely identify ensitrelvir drug-resistant mutants (DRM-E) without the need of using virulent forms of SARS-CoV-2. We isolated a DRM-E containing a G23 deletion (G23del) in Mpro with high resistance (>1,000 fold) to ensitrelvir, but not to the other Mpro inhibitor (nirmatrelvir) or to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir.

The C9orf72 repeat expansion is bidirectionally transcribed into sense and anti-sense RNA foci, and also produces dipeptide repeats (DPRs) via a non-canonical translation mechanism known as repeat-associated (RAN) translation. Each of these components of the G4C2 repeat expansion cause neurodegenerative effects in animal models when expressed in neurons, but impacts from glial expression are more poorly understood. Here, we use glial cell type-specific expression of individual DPRs, of RNA repeat-only, or of the G4C2 repeat that is capable of producing both DPRs and RNA repeats to systematically investigate both the glial cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous toxicity of each of these components. Our results show that as with neurons, the GR and G4C2 transgenes, produce the highest degree of cell-intrinsic toxicity when expressed in glia. Both of these transgenes are capable of producing the GR DPR, which is also typically found to be the most toxic factor in neurons. We demonstrate that both the GR and G4C2 transgenes cause activation of mdg4, an endogenous retrovirus (ERV). Such ERV expression is a hallmark of TDP-43 dysfunction that is commonly observed in C9orf72 patients and contributes to both cell intrinsic and non-cell autonomous toxicity. We find that only the G4C2 transgene produces measurable non-cell autonomous effects that result in loss of nearby neurons. But manipulations of apoptosis reveal non-cell autonomous or systemic effects from either GR or G4C2 expressing glia. Blocking apoptotic cell death of either GR or G4C2 expressing glia via the p35 caspase inhibitor further exacerbates effects on lifespan and ablating such glia via expression of the proapoptotic reaper gene partially ameliorates these effects.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Our study first confirmed the existence of four disulfide bonds in the GluN1 subunit using biochemistry in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. Disrupting the individual disulfide bonds by serine replacements produced the following surface expression trend for GluN1/GluN2A, GluN1/GluN2B, and GluN1/GluN3A receptors: wild-type (WT) > GluN1-C744S-C798S > GluN1-C79S-C308S > GluN1-C420S-C454S > GluN1-C436S-C455S subunits. Electrophysiology revealed altered functional properties of NMDARs with disrupted disulfide bonds, specifically an increased probability of opening (Po) at the GluN1-C744S-C798S/GluN2 receptors. Synchronized release from the endoplasmic reticulum confirmed that disruption of disulfide bonds impaired early trafficking of NMDARs in HEK293T cells and primary hippocampal neurons prepared from Wistar rats of both sexes (embryonic day 18). The pathogenic GluN1-C744Y variant, associated with neurodevelopmental disorder and seizures, caused reduced surface expression and increased Po at GluN1/GluN2 receptors, consistent with findings for the GluN1-C744S-C798S subunit. The FDA-approved memantine inhibited GluN1-C744Y/GluN2 receptors more potently and with distinct kinetics compared to WT GluN1/GluN2 receptors. We also observed enhanced NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in hippocampal neurons expressing the GluN1-C744Y subunit, which memantine reduced more effectively compared to the WT GluN1 subunit. Lastly, we demonstrated that the presence of the hGluN1-1a-C744Y subunit counteracted the effect of the hGluN3A subunit on decreasing dendritic spine maturation, consistent with the reduced surface delivery of the NMDARs carrying this variant.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

However, how internal state selectively regulates high-sodium aversion remains unknown. Here, we identify the first Na+-selective high-salt taste receptor and demonstrate its essential role in internal-state-dependent sodium avoidance. In Drosophila, the ionotropic receptor IR11a, together with co-receptor IR25a, functions in bitter gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) to mediate aversion to high Na+. Loss of IR11a abolishes neuronal and behavioral responses to Na+ and Li+, while sparing detection of K+, Ca2+, and bitter compounds. Heterologous expression confirms that IR11a and IR25a form a Na+-selective channel. Notably, sodium deprivation or satiety specifically modulates Na+ sensitivity in IR11a+ GRNs--without altering responses to K+ or bitter stimuli--and this modulation requires the IR11a/IR25a complex. These findings reveal a dedicated, state-dependent Na+-sensing pathway embedded within aversive taste cells, providing a peripheral mechanism for adaptive sodium consumption based on physiological need.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

D.; Gaultier, C.; Goehring, T.", "abstract": "During speech perception, properties of the acoustic stimulus can be reconstructed from the listener's brain using methods such as electroencephalography (EEG). Most studies employ the amplitude envelope as a target for decoding; however, speech acoustics can be characterised on multiple dimensions, including as spectral descriptors. The current study assesses how robustly an extended acoustic feature set can be decoded from EEG under varying levels of intelligibility and acoustic clarity. Analysis was conducted using EEG from 38 young adults who heard intelligible and non-intelligible speech that was either unprocessed or spectrally degraded using vocoding. We extracted a set of acoustic features which, alongside the envelope, characterised instantaneous properties of the speech spectrum (e.g., spectral slope) or spectral change over time (e.g., spectral flux). We establish the robustness of feature decoding by employing multiple model architectures and, in the case of linear decoders, by standardising decoding accuracy (Pearson's r) using randomly permuted surrogate data. Linear models yielded the highest r relative to non-linear models. However, the separate decoder architectures produced a similar pattern of results across features and experimental conditions. After converting r values to Z-scores scaled by random data, we observed substantive differences in the noise floor between features. Decoding accuracy significantly varies by spectral degradation and speech intelligibility for some features, but such differences are reduced in the most robustly decoded features. This suggests acoustic feature reconstruction is primarily driven by generalised auditory processing. Our results demonstrate that linear decoders perform comparably to non-linear decoders in capturing the EEG response to speech acoustic properties beyond the amplitude envelope, with the reconstructive accuracy of some features also associated with understanding and spectral clarity. This sheds light on how sound properties are differentially represented by the brain and shows potential for clinical applications moving forward.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Previous phonetic learning studies have mostly focused on pre- and post-training comparisons, leaving daily learning trajectories largely unexplored. Here, in Finnish speakers naive to tone languages, we tracked day-to-day changes in Mandarin tone perception during a short training program (1 h/day for 4 days), complemented by pre- and post-training behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures. Each learning session comprised exposure to Mandarin tones in continuous and isolated speech with cues, change detection and identification with feedback, and a listen-and-repeat exercise. To assess the role of co-presence, participants learned either in pairs (n = 22) or individually (n = 20). We found that discrimination and categorization speed, as well as discrimination accuracy, improved from pre- to posttest, with performance also increasing across daily training sessions. Paired learners showed higher sensitivity (d') to tone changes on the first day than individual learners, consistent with co-presence-driven attentional facilitation. At the neural level, P3a amplitude to tone changes during passive listening increased after training, reflecting enhanced automatic orienting to novel sounds at whole group level.

Current treatments remain limited, highlighting the need for novel non invasive therapeutic approaches. Repetitive magnetic stimulation (RMS) has emerged as a promising strategy, but its mechanisms and efficacy in inflammatory contexts remain poorly described. Here, we investigated the effects of RMS applied as trans spinal RMS (rTSMS) in a mouse model of focal spinal cord demyelination induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). When applied one day after LPC injection, rTSMS reduced inflammation, demyelination, and fibroglial scar formation, while promoting early locomotor recovery in both sexes. In contrast, when treatment was initiated three days after LPC injection, corresponding to the peak of motor deficits, rTSMS conferred tissue protection and functional benefits only in female mice. RNA sequencing analyses revealed sex dependent immune modulation: in females, rTSMS primarily regulated adaptive T cell related pathways, whereas in males, it mainly targeted innate immune responses such as neutrophil activity and phagocytosis. Complementary in vitro experiments using microglial and macrophage cultures further demonstrated that RMS modulates transcriptomic responses differently depending on cell type and inflammatory state. Specifically, RMS attenuated IL1 induced pro-inflammatory signaling in macrophages and completely abolished these effects in microglia. Altogether, our findings establish rTSMS as a non invasive therapy capable of reducing neuroinflammation and demyelination in inflammatory SCI, with pronounced sex dependent effects.

Together, these data provide cell type-specific cis-regulatory atlas of LepRHypo neuronal subtypes, including Glp1r/Lepr-enriched populations, and highlight evolutionarily conserved, subtype-specific regulatory elements, associated candidate genes, and putative functional variants that may modulate LepRHypo subtype function and influence energy homeostasis and obesity susceptibility in humans.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

In the present study, BLA-INs immunoreactive(ir) for parvalbumin (PV) or neuropeptide Y (NPY) and their interrelations with serotonergic and catecholaminergic afferents were analyzed in wildtype (WT) and serotonin transporter knockout (5-HTT KO) mice, a model for anxiety- and stress-related disorders. In WT mice, PV- and NPY-ir INs fall into morphological subgroups which possess perisomatic appositions by serotonergic and tyrosine hydroxylase-ir afferents. Dual immunolabeling shows no colocalization of PV and NPY. NPY/somatostatin(SOM) dual labeling documents colocalization of the peptides in some neurons, and single labeling for NPY or SOM in others. These features appear largely preserved in 5-HTT KO mice. However, quantification of PV- and NPY-ir neurons documents a reduction in number and density of NPY-ir neurons throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the amygdala in 5-HTT KO mice. PV-ir neurons remain unchanged. Quantitative PCR shows increased expression of Npy receptor 2, Som receptor 4, and corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1 in the BLA of 5-HTT KO mice. mRNA for the three peptides is unchanged, indicating that it may be NPY propeptide translation which is reduced in 5-HTT KO mice.

F.", "abstract": "Movements during development are refined through the ongoing maturation of the spinal circuits that mediate them. In many vertebrates, including zebrafish, this maturation process involves neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and dopamine; however, the targets of this neuromodulation remain largely unknown. Recent work has revealed distinct developmental dynamics of the non-inactivating subthreshold potassium current, the M-current, in primary motoneurons of larval zebrafish. Considering that neuromodulators play a role in the maturation of locomotor control in larval zebrafish, we asked whether neuromodulators might target the M-current in primary motoneurons during development. Our patch-clamp experiments in primary motoneurons of zebrafish aged 3 to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) reveal distinct modulation of the M-current by serotonin and acetylcholine that is age-dependent. Our data demonstrates an inhibitory influence of serotonin signaling via 5HT1A receptors that promotes repetitive firing in primary motoneurons specifically at 3 dpf. We also show that acetylcholine, likely via M2/M4 receptors, enhances the M-current and limits repetitive firing in primary motoneurons but does so only after 3 dpf. Modulation of the M-current in primary motoneurons was not observed across all neuromodulators as dopamine had no effect at any age. Considering that the M-current transiently peaks at 3 dpf and is reduced at 4 and 5 dpf, our findings suggest that the developmental changes in this current can shape how neuromodulators modulate firing properties of primary motoneurons.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a powerful in vitro system to explore the underlying cause of PDC. iPSC lines were derived from lymphocytes of a PDC-affected Guamanian Chamorro female patient and an age- and gender-matched healthy Chamorro resident of PDC-unaffected Saipan using non-integrating episomal plasmids. iPSCs derived from both patients expressed pluripotency markers (Oct4, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, Sox2) prior to the generation of neuroprogenitor cells (hNPCs), neurons and astrocytes. An embryoid body protocol was used to derive hNPCs from both iPSC lines while a differentiation media was used to generate neurons from hNPCs. hNPCs derived from both iPSC lines displayed established neuroprogenitor markers (nestin, Sox2), while the differentiated hNPCs exhibited both neuronal (beta-tubulin III, Map2, doublecortin) and synaptic (synaptophysin, PSD-95) markers. Expression of these protein markers in hNPCs and neurons by dot blotting was also observed for both lines. Astrocyte progenitor cells and mature astrocytes with appropriate markers were also developed from the hNPCs of both lines using commercial kits.

INF2 regulation requires an auto-inhibitory interaction between the N-terminal Diaphanous Inhibitory Domain (DID) and the C-terminal Diaphanous Auto-regulatory Domain (DAD). DID mutations are dominantly linked to two human diseases, and constitutively activate INF2. However, DAD binding to actin monomers competes with DID binding, disrupting regulation. Here, we use a novel cell-free assay for detailed investigation of INF2 regulation. Contrary to our previous findings, INF2 inhibition does not require CAP proteins but does require actin buffering by monomer-binding proteins such as profilin or thymosin. INF2 is activated by calcium-bound calmodulin (CALM) through CALM binding to the N-terminus. In addition, the N-terminus plays an important role in INF2 regulation beyond CALM binding.

Previous work has shown that 3D-printed clay domes with helix recesses significantly increase settlement and survival of coral recruits compared to control designs without recesses. To examine the broader applicability of these findings for engineering applications, we tested whether the helix microhabitat design could be transferred to space-efficient pylon-like, cylindrical geometries and evaluated its performance across different materials and fabrication methods (cast concrete vs. 3D-printed clay). In a field experiment in K[a]neohe Bay, Hawaii, coral recruitment was monitored over six months on four cylindrical rod types (varying in diameter and material) and two conical superdome modules, featuring recesses based on the previously optimized helix profile. Cylindrical rods had similar recruitment densities to those on superdome designs, indicating a successful transfer of the design. Most recruits settled inside the recesses across all structures, while outer surfaces consistently supported fewer recruits. Settlement was initially higher on concrete modules, but this difference disappeared over time. The large clay rods, which had wider recesses, maintained the highest recruit densities after six months, suggesting enhanced post-settlement survival. Compared to natural reefs, planar recruit densities on the structures were ~300 times higher. These results indicate that helix design is functionally robust across geometries and materials, with recess size influencing post-settlement outcomes. Cylindrical structures with integrated helix recesses represent a practical, low-cost method that can be implemented in coastal engineering to enhance coral settlement.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

White-rot fungi decompose recalcitrant crystalline cellulose using a large array of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes. Brown-rot fungi lack many of these enzymes but decompose cellulose via Fenton-generated hydroxyl radicals. To better understand these mechanisms, we developed a Raman spectroscopy-based method to study cellulose decomposition by two white-rot fungi (Bjerkandera adusta and Trametes versicolor), a brown-rot fungus (Fomitopsis pinicola), and a Stereaceae species of uncertain decay type. Raman spectra of fungi-decomposed cellulose were highly complex, reflecting physical and chemical cellulose modifications and fungal compounds like pigments. To extract signals only from decomposed cellulose and reduce data dimensionality, reference libraries were generated using chemicals that reduce crystallinity (NaOH) or oxidize cellulose (TEMPO). Chemical libraries reduced data complexity and facilitated extraction of cellulose decomposition signals, distinguishing white-rot from brown-rot effects. Wavenumbers related to oxidation better contributed to the separation of the two decomposition types. The reduced datasets also matched the decomposition characteristics of the uncertain decay fungus to those of the brown-rot fungus. The methodology developed here could be used to further characterize plant cell wall biopolymer decomposition in single fungus-single substrate setups and complex soil samples.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

However, this dosage compensation is often incomplete, leaving X enriched for genes with female-biased expression. In this context, iguanian lizards are noteworthy among vertebrates because several species from separate families appear to exhibit both near-complete dosage compensation and male-female expression balance across their ancient, homologous X chromosomes. We tested for this pattern in the Eastern Fence Lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) and found instead that that both ancient and more recently sex-linked regions of the X chromosome are enriched for genes with female-biased expression, regardless of age (neonate, juvenile, adult) or tissue (brain, liver, muscle). By expanding our analysis across 10 phrynosomatid species spanning 4 genera, we found that male-female expression imbalance on the ancestral region of X is phylogenetically conserved. We also found that an inferred chromosomal rearrangement in the S. jarrovii lineage has resulted in the novel acquisition of female-biased expression by a region of formerly autosomal genes. Whereas sex-biased expression of the ancestral region of X is primarily due to females overexpressing X-linked genes relative to autosomal genes, sex-biased expression of these formerly autosomal genes in S. jarrovii is primarily due to males underexpressing this putative neo-X region. We conclude that male-female expression imbalance on X is widespread across phrynosomatids, potentially reflecting both overexpression in females for ancestral regions that have evolved dosage compensation and underexpression in males for neo-X regions in which dosage compensation has yet to evolve.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Although the latest methods can study multiple CRFs simultaneously, they cannot examine the interaction between these factors. Inferring biological interactions often requires integrating data from multiple experiments, which can be labor-intensive and imprecise since the measurement is not from the same DNA molecule. To address these challenges, we developed Hi-Plex CUT&Tag, an advanced technology that enables the robust detection of co-localization events across over 600 pairs of CRFs using 36 barcoded monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), while minimizing background signals and cross-contamination. Hi-Plex CUT&Tag facilitates comprehensive pairwise analysis of epigenetic modifiers, including histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), writers, and transcription factors (TFs). Each Tn5 tagmentation fragment provides detailed insights, capturing the identities of two co-localized events, the underlying genomic sequences, and the molecular distance between them. For the first time, numerous novel bivalent events, epigenetic-context dependent transcriptional regulation, and specific chromatin mark combinations with significant impacts on gene regulation can be detected in a single experiment.

In 70-day lab-scale batch tests (volume: 2 L), engineering diagnostics revealed that sequential additions of brown seaweed elevated salinity to 3.3% ash content, stabilized pH at 5.8 to 6.1, collapsed the CH4/CO2 ratio from 2.98 to <0.04, suppressed biogas by 96%, and boosted carbon-conversion efficiency from 10% to 52%. More than half of the influent carbon was redirected from methane to a liquid-phase VFAs pool, dominated by butyrate, hexanoate, and acetate, peaking at 14.5 g/L. Microbial surveillance using 16S rRNA sequencing presented a 10-fold decline in methanogens, alongside an increase in salt- and acid-tolerant acidogenic microbial families, including Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridiaceae, as well as seaweed-derived microbial families, including Psychromonadaceae, and Marinomonadaceae. Temporal synchrony and asynchrony-resolved analysis confirmed a strong correlation between two tiers, revealing an operational window featured with two patterns: a rapid engineering parameter response (where changes in engineering parameters were followed by a decline in methanogens within 0 to 3 days) and a slower microbial restructuring (where the surge in VFA concentration lagged the enrichment of seaweed-derived acidogens by 1 to 5 days). Based on this operation window, feedback control strategies were simulated for SW-AAD, indicating that cumulative VFAs (cVFAs) yield could be bolstered from 11.38 to 16.13 g COD/L (increasing 41.8%).

This study investigates an approach of reducing defective viruses through the infusion of standard recombinant baculovirus (rBV) and the compartmentalization of early- and late-stage infected cells, resulting in stable rAAV production.

To more effectively identify and partition sources of natural variation in the modal properties of trees, there is a need for more reliable estimates derived from long-term observations. Using improved Bayesian methods, the modal properties of one green ash tree were identified over an entire growing season with simultaneous measurements of nearby weather conditions and phenological observations. The analysis confirmed many features of tree vibration observed in an earlier related study, including two prevalent close, nearly orthogonal modes and amplitude dependence for modal properties, but the more extensive and detailed measurements also revealed new characteristics, including changes in the arrangement of partial mode shapes and sizeable variation in modal properties over multiple time scales. For the leafless tree, the two modes were consistently oriented in directions aligned with the planting layout of surrounding trees, but their orientation varied erratically over time, while remaining roughly perpendicular to one another, during periods with leaves. Though some of the modal property variation closely paralleled other measurements, including weather conditions and vegetative phenophases, in physically reasonable ways, the reasons for other changes were not clear. Using a detailed assessment of the governing factors for estimate uncertainty, the cause of low-quality estimates was attributed to very close or nearly identical modes, and the causes and implications of close modes for tree vibration monitoring should be a main priority for future studies.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Purpose: This study evaluated the hypothesis that baseline tissue oxygen (pO2) would modulate FLASH damage sparing in murine skin, comparing MeV ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) versus conventional dose rate (CDR). Methods and Materials: Murine leg skin pO2 was systematically varied and measured during irradiation from a Mobetron 9 MeV linac at 25 Gy, comparing UHDR (=240 Gy/s) to CDR (=0.16 Gy/s), for skin damage outcomes. Radiolytic oxygen consumption, gO2 (mmHg/Gy), was also quantified in vivo. Baseline tissue pO2 was systematically modulated in 5 different treatment cohorts, using known methods of the inhaled gas (room air, 100% oxygen, or carbogen) and through applied limb vascular compression (partial or full). Induced skin damage was scored daily per mouse, and averaged in each group. Results: FLASH skin sparing was observed in groups with partial leg clamping (pO2=7+-4mmHg), inhaled air (pO2=12+-6mmHg) and oxygen (tissue pO216+-4mmHg), while reduction in time-to-damage was significant just in the air inhalation group. No FLASH effect was observed at zero oxygen, via complete blood flow occlusion (pO2=0+-1mmHg), or when modulated by inhaled carbogen (pO2=21+-7mmHg). In vivo measure of radiolytic consumption, gO2, correlated to initial pO2 when FLASH was present (pO2=4-16mmHg) and saturated above pO2>16mmHg. Inspired carbogen induced highest the pO2 and maximum damage at 25 Gy. Reductions in dose to 20 and 15 Gy reduced skin damage, but did not result in FLASH sparing. Conclusions: These findings indicate that tissue pO2 directly modulates in vivo FLASH skin tissue sparing, requiring roughly room air or 100% oxygen anesthetic gas levels for this effect to be present. The FLASH effect is diminished by the absence of oxygen or from abnormally high oxygen values. Variations in dose does not appear to alter this observation at carbogen induced pO2 levels, and the consumption rate of oxygen is directly correlated to the baseline value when the FLASH effect is present.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Mutations in TP53 occur in various ways which can result in p53 null tumor cells as well as in tumor cells highly expressing missense, gain of oncogenic function p53 proteins. Gain of function p53 proteins not only lose wild type p53 pro-apoptotic and DNA repair functions, but gain novel oncogenic functions. We hypothesize that directly targeting missense mutant p53 instead of downstream pathways has substantial advantages. Analogues of curcumin have been reported to bind mutant p53 to accomplish this goal. In this report, we studied a series of novel molecules derived from the curcumin backbone. We identified a particularly active curcumin analogue, AKT-100, and demonstrate binding to mutant p53 proteins to reinstate p53 wild type functionality. This agent exhibits impressive cell killing in multiple ovarian and serous endometrial cancer cells at concentrations ranging from 100-300 nM. AKT-100 is also synergistic with the PARP inhibitor olaparib and with chemotherapy by inhibiting alternative DNA repair mechanisms associated with resistance to standard therapies.

Critical to an effective DFT vaccine are target antigens. Putative non-coding regions of genomes have been identified as potential tumour-specific antigens for human cancer. These non-coding regions include long terminal repeats of endogenous retroviral elements. We identified 11,193 ERV LTR transcripts that were expressed in DFT1 or DFT2 transcriptomes but not in healthy tissue samples. Using a proteogenomic approach, we identified 33 ERV LTR peptides unique to DFT1 and/or DFT2 immunopeptidomes; four of these were validated in subsequent screens with synthetic peptides. Our study shows the potential for ERV LTRs as novel vaccine targets against DFT1 and DFT2.

Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids responsible for vibrant shades of pink, red, and blue pigmentation, are almost ubiquitous in angiosperms but are replaced by betalains in some families in the order Caryophyllales. We investigated anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, the second-largest fruit and vegetable family, characterised by white and yellow flowers and red, orange, and green fruits predominantly pigmented by carotenoids. Using a comprehensive collection of 258 datasets representing species across all 15 tribes of Cucurbitaceae and a phylogenomics approach, we observed a systematic absence of genes involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Absence of the structural genes DFR, ANS, arGST, LAR, and ANR, along with the anthocyanin-related regulatory MYB genes, was consistently confirmed by synteny and phylogenetic analysis. These results suggest that anthocyanin loss in angiosperms is more common than previously assumed. In light of this new discovery, we propose a stepwise loss of anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, likely accompanied by a partial functional replacement with carotenoid pigmentation.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Results The qualitative analysis revealed differences in terms of individual components and individual days of the experiment. The quantitative analysis of leaf anatomy showed that the most pronounced changes were observed in the level of proteoglycans (JIM13, JIM15) and polysaccharides (LM5, LM16, LM20). The leaves of plants growing in drought were characterized by destroyed fragments, in which increased secretion of extensins, AGPs, galactans, hemicelluloses, and RG-I was noted. In turn, the qualitative analyses of the microscopy images of roots, along with fluorescence intensity analyses, revealed a significantly higher content of AGP and arabinoxylan in the exodermis in plants grown under drought stress.

This study investigated the abundance and species richness of immature and adult mosquitoes associated with bromeliad plantings in Sydney, Australia. Between October 2023 and April 2024, immature mosquitoes were sampled weekly from large bromeliads at 17 locations, and adults were collected with CO2; baited Encephalitic Virus Surveillance traps at six sites of contrasting bromeliad density. Specimens were identified to species level, and associations with climatic variables, bromeliad species, and planting characteristics were analysed using generalised linear mixed models. A total of 2,326 immature mosquitoes (three species) and 6,366 adult mosquitoes (ten species) were collected. Aedes notoscriptus and Culex quinquefasciatus dominated both life stages. Total immature abundance increased by 4% for each additional bromeliad in a patch (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.05), and was highest in Alcantarea imperialis (IRR 1.31, 95% CI 0.97-1.77). Weekly-lagged humidity was positively associated with immature counts (IRR 1.01 per 1% increase, 95% CI 1.00-1.03). Adult abundance was significantly higher at high-density compared to low-density bromeliad sites (IRR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23-0.60).

Our previous research uncovered a critical pathogenic feed-forward loop between the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), where they mutually drive each other's expression, culminating in mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Targeting this vicious cycle represents a promising therapeutic strategy. To discover a potent inhibitor of this axis, we performed high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library. This identified Mitoxantrone hydrochloride (MH), an antineoplastic agent, as a lead compound. We demonstrate that MH dually suppresses both APP transcription and LRRK2 expression/kinase activity, the latter via direct binding to the LRRK2 kinase domain. In cellular models, including patient-derived neurons, MH mitigated neurotoxicity by reducing apoptosis. Critically, in both toxin-induced and genetic PD mouse models, MH treatment rescued dopaminergic neuron loss, reduced phospho--synuclein, and reversed motor deficits.

Human neuropsychology and neuroimaging studies have implicated the medial temporal lobe (MTL), including the hippocampus (HPC), in WM particularly when memory load exceeds span, yet no animal model has been established to investigate supraspan mechanisms. Here, we present a novel rodent model of supraspan memory and examine the distinct roles of dorsal and ventral HPC. Using selective NMDA lesions in mice combined with object recognition tasks and a modified radial arm maze (RAM), we manipulated memory load and strategy constraints to assess span and supraspan performance. Dorsal HPC lesions impaired object memory span, while ventral lesions spared this ability. In the RAM, span performance (number of correct arm visits before the first error) was unaffected by either lesion under allocentric conditions. However, once animals exceeded span, following the first error, here defined as the supraspan condition, both dorsal and ventral lesions caused catastrophic disorientation and error escalation. Under free-choice conditions, ventral HPC lesions selectively reduced the occurrence of trials with no errors in the first 5 choices, increased errors overall, and disrupted sequential egocentric strategies. Together, these results demonstrate that supraspan performance can be modeled in rodents, revealing a dorsal contribution to object memory under high load, a ventral contribution to egocentric spatial strategies, and a shared hippocampal role in supraspan memory performance. This paradigm provides a translational framework for investigating supraspan deficits observed in MTL patients and Alzheimer's disease.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Objectives: Auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) are used to diagnose hearing loss across multiple frequencies in infants and others who cannot participate in behavioral testing. The parallel ABR (pABR) paradigm measures response waveforms to all frequencies from 500 ot 8000 Hz in both ears all at once, rather than serially in one ear at a time. Work so far has been with air conducted stimuli through insert earphones, but bone conducted stimuli are also an essential part of diagnosing the type of hearing loss by determining the relative contributions of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. This study aimed to confirm the feasibility of bone conduction pABR. Design: We recruited a cohort of young adults with normal hearing. An intensity series of two-channel ABRs were measured to pABR stimuli played through ER-2 insert earphones as well as with a B-71 bone vibrator with contralateral masking. Behavioral thresholds were also measured to compare dB nHL correction factors. To keep sessions under 3.5 hours only one ear was tested with bone conduction. The ear with bone conduction and the order of transducers was counterbalanced across participants. Waveform morphologies for each transducer were compared by their wave V latencies and amplitudes and residual noise. Results: For the same dB nHL levels, responses to both transducers aligned well and wave V amplitudes and latencies were similar. While stimulus artifacts can be an issue with bone conduction, the steps taken to mitigate it in air conduction pABR were also effective for bone conduction: clear bone conducted responses were measured and residual noise was similar for both transducers. Bone conducted responses to 8 kHz were weak, which was not surprising given the physics of bone conduction and the output capabilities of the bone vibrator. As expected, behavioral thresholds were higher for pABR than pure tone stimuli, and by the same offset for both transducers. The dB nHL values differed due to the difference in reference equivalent threshold levels for inserts and the bone vibrator. Conclusions: Air and bone conduction provided similar waveforms, indicating that bone conduction pABR is feasible. Together with establishing dB nHL values, this work represents an important step towards translating the pABR for diagnosing all types of hearing loss.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

E.; Fallah, M.", "abstract": "The accurate perception of moving objects is a fundamental challenge for the visual system, which must compensate for neural processing delays. Motion extrapolation is a proposed mechanism whereby the brain predicts an object's future position. We investigated how an object's motion history shapes its perceived position using the flash-jump illusion, in which a brief color change in a moving bar is mislocalized as further along the direction of motion. Across two experiments, we found that longer preceding motion sequences improved localization accuracy, consistent with motion adaptation. This effect occurred regardless of whether motion continued after the flash. Notably, mislocalization transiently reappeared as the object crossed the vertical midline, suggesting that motion adaptation and motion extrapolation operate independently between within each hemifield. Manipulating the length of the sequence in each hemifield in Experiment 2 confirmed that this adaptation is spatially confined to each hemifield, with limited interhemispheric transfer. The results align with a Bayesian framework in which the brain integrates signals from both hemispheres, with midline crossings triggering a shift from adapted to unadapted neural populations. We identify motion extrapolation, supported by hemifield-specific adaptation in area MT and integration in area MST, as the mechanism behind these midline discontinuities. This work reframes smooth pursuit not just as a tracking behaviour, but as a functional solution to overcome the inherent limits of interhemispheric motion processing.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Importantly, recent data from post-mortem tissue as well as biomarker studies suggest that independent of mutations, increased kinase activity of LRRK2 plays an essential role in idiopathic PD pathogenesis. Despite extensive research on LRRK2, its activation mechanism(s) and how the various mutations result in increased kinase activity and neuronal death is still not completely understood. Accumulating evidence points to LRRK2 phospho-regulation, both auto-phosphorylation and phosphorylation by other kinases, as one potential molecular trigger of its activation. LRRK2 activation and localization is regulated by phosphatases such as Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), however the exact mechanism of this phospho-regulation is not known. Our data reveal that PP2A dephosphorylates sites within the RocCOR-GTPase domain of LRRK2 and as a result de-stabilizes LRRK2 dimers, with consequent reduction of its kinase activity. Strikingly, our data further highlight that LRRK2 in turn phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme PPP2CA at its critical residue T304, crucial for both holoenzyme formation and catalytic activity. Importantly, expression of WT-PPP2CA protects from LRRK2-G2019S induced neuronal cell death, while PPP2CA-T304 mutants fail to do so, suggesting that impaired PP2A holoenzyme formation might be detrimental for LRRK2-PD.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We find that experience of a punished outcome generates a BLA representation that is selectively replayed when animals subsequently abort choice of the large/risky reward option.

The striatum, composed of dopamine receptor type 1 (D1)- and type 2 (D2)- expressing spiny projection neurons (SPN), integrates cortical sensory and motor inputs to coordinate movement and motivation, making it a critical candidate for mediating pain-induced behavioral adaptations. Although spinal and cortical pain circuits are well-characterized in limited phases of pain, how corticostriatal pathways and distinct striatal cell populations contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain states remains unclear. Here we show that neuropathic pain, after spared nerve injury in mice, produces temporally distinct, cell-type-specific changes in striatal SPN activity and corticostriatal plasticity that evolve across acute to chronic pain phases. D1 SPNs exhibit smaller amplitude and slower calcium signals during acute pain stages that persist through early chronic phases, while D2 SPNs show delayed response timing during later chronic stages, but also stimulus-specific alterations in neural activity throughout acute and chronic pain states. Critically, primary somatosensory cortex inputs to D2 SPNs develop depressing synapses specifically during intermediate chronic pain phases (~25 days post-injury) that disappear during more severe chronic stages (>3 months), suggesting a failed compensatory mechanism. These findings reveal that striatal circuits undergo dynamic, time-dependent reorganization after peripheral injury, with D1 and D2 pathways contributing distinct temporal signatures to pain-related behavior. The identification of critical windows of striatal plasticity provides new targets for therapeutic interventions that could prevent or reverse chronic pain states by modulating specific corticostriatal circuits during vulnerable transition periods.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Prior work has shown that normal-appearing signals can persist in primary sensory cortical areas during seizures, suggesting that impaired behavioral responsiveness may arise from disruptions in higher-order association cortex. To investigate this hypothesis, we combined behavioral testing with simultaneous local field potential recordings in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). Rats were trained in an auditory conditioned response task, allowing comparison of tone-evoked responses during interictal baseline and ictal SWDs. We found that behavioral performance collapsed during SWDs, with correct responses falling from ~88% at baseline to <1% during SWDs (p < 0.001). Nevertheless, auditory event-related potentials in primary auditory cortex (Au1) during SWDs were not significantly decreased. In contrast, we identified a novel oscillatory evoked potential in the anterior insular cortex (AIC) that was robust in controls, attenuated in GAERS at baseline, and markedly reduced during SWDs. Notably, reductions in AIC response magnitude also occurred during satiated, unmotivated states, but waveform structure was preserved, distinguishing motivational modulation from seizure-related disruption. These results demonstrate that absence seizures selectively impair signals in the anterior insula rather than in primary auditory cortex, identifying the AIC as a potentially critical hub for gating auditory conscious awareness. Beyond refining models of seizure-related unconsciousness, the discovery of an insular oscillatory potential highlights a candidate biomarker and intervention target for absence epilepsy, with broader implications for understanding impaired consciousness in anesthesia, sleep, and brain injury.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

This ability relies on the continuous integration of external sensory information (e.g., visual displacements) and internal monitoring signals. At the time of the saccade subjects often experience saccadic suppression of displacement--a failure to notice changes in the location of visual objects slightly shifted during the eye movement. Although well studied, questions remain regarding how and when external sensory signals lead to perceptual judgment alterations following saccadic eye movements. Here we used a drift diffusion modeling (DDM) framework to systematically examine the extent to which sensory information biased perceptual judgments when detecting trans-saccadic shifts of visual targets. Healthy human participants (N = 30, 21 female) completed a visual perception task in which a visual target was shifted following a prompted saccadic eye movement (4o or 8o). Target displacements occurred up to +/-2.5o along the horizontal axis, and participants reported the shift direction with a button press response. Incorporating the perceptual response and visual error between the displaced target and end-movement fixation location, the DDM accounted for the visuospatial biasing effects of sensory processing on decision-making. The modeling framework based on the visual error could also capture individual positive and negative biasing effects across backward shifts (i.e., towards the initial fixation location) and forward shifts (i.e., further away from initial fixation). Furthermore, participants whose perceptual bias was more pronounced in either the backward or forward directions tended to show a greater visuospatial offset in evidence accumulation preceding perceptual judgments due to an overreliance on the visual error information. The DDM computational modeling approach described here shows promise as an explanatory framework to account for sensorimotor integration impairments based on perceptual deficits demonstrated in certain patient populations.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Such activation is predictive, occurs in non-musicians after a single motor training session, and can be elicited at the single-note level of the practiced melody. These findings support the idea that motor activity guides auditory perception by relaying predictive timing information. However, the evidence remains incomplete, as the neural processes underlying this anticipatory motor activity are not fully understood. EEG studies in musicians have linked it to mu-band suppression, but the temporal scale at which suppression occurs has not been established, and its generalizability to the broader population remains unclear. To address these gaps, we recruited 25 non-musicians who learned to play a simple melody on a piano-like keyboard. Before and after training, participants passively listened to the trained melody and control melodies. Offline, EEG data from the motor training were used to create a time-frequency mask identifying channels, frequencies, and timepoints likely to display mu suppression during passive listening. Significant mu suppression emerged before each note onset only during post-training exposure to the practiced melody, with no effects in other frequency bands. Results prove that mu suppression occurs at the single-note level following short auditory-motor training and is not dependent on prior musical training. Thus, mu suppression appears tied to the anticipatory motor activity observed in prior studies, supporting the notion that motor activity aids perception by anticipating the unfolding of learned auditory-motor sequences.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We show that E. coli promotes B cell recruitment through the production of curli amyloid fibers, which signal via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2).

The CHIKV nonstructural proteins nsP2 and nsP4 encode essential enzymatic activities that represent key targets for antiviral development, yet the biochemical basis of nsP4 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a minimal, functional precursor form of nsP4 derived from the nsP3-nsP4 polyprotein (P34) that is active in a cell-based RNA replicon system. Using synthetic, capped mRNAs, we show that cleavage of P34 by the nsP2 protease is required for robust reporter expression, and that a truncated form retaining only the C-terminal 50 residues of nsP3 (CT50-P34) supports near-wild-type replication. Unexpectedly, ubiquitin-nsP4 fusions failed to substitute for P34, likely reflecting the transient expression supported by our RNA-based system. We propose that precursor forms of nsP4 interact with the nsP1 dodecamer at the site of genome replication, where cleavage activates the RdRp and localization within the nsP1 dodecamer maintains nsP4 in its active conformation. Dissociation from the nsP1 dodecamer triggers a conformational switch to an inactive state. Together, these findings establish a tractable framework for interrogation of the assembly, activation, and regulation of the alphavirus polymerase.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Because islet {beta} cells actively shape local immune responses, we hypothesized that sex-specific islet responses to inflammation contribute to this disparity. Using transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of human islets from male and female donors, we found that male islets exhibit a more aggressive response to proinflammatory cytokines, characterized by greater induction of interferon signaling and suppression of developmental signaling compared to female islets. Treatment of human islets and mouse {beta} cells with the sex hormone 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) suppressed inflammatory signaling and markers of {beta}-cell maturity while enhancing developmental gene programs. Complementary studies in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice showed that E2 treatment reduces diabetes incidence and limits progression to severe insulitis. Islet single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that E2 treatment of NOD mice suppresses interferon signaling, chemokine production, and antigen presentation in {beta} cells, while reducing activation and cytotoxicity pathways in immune cells. In co-culture studies in vitro, E2 pretreatment of mouse islets reduces subsequent activation of T cells, and in an aggressive adoptive transfer model in vivo, E2 pretreatment of the recipient mice was found to attenuate hyperglycemia. These findings support a model in which E2-mediated {beta}-cell reprogramming reduces {beta}-cell immunogenicity and promotes local immune tolerance, offering mechanistic insight into sex-biased T1D susceptibility.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We tested if the two distinct classes of BMP type II receptors, Bmpr2 and Acvr2, also act in the signaling complex. We determined that Acvr2 receptors solely transduce BMP signaling in DV patterning. We mutated all four acvr2a and acvr2b genes in the zebrafish and found that maternal-zygotic depletion of just Acvr2b receptors abrogates all BMP signaling, indicating that Acvr2b is the primary type II receptor transducing BMP signaling in the gastrula. We further demonstrated that hyperactive signaling through the ACVR1-R206H Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva human disease-causing mutant receptor is restricted when maternal and zygotic contributions of either Acvr2ba or Acvr2bb are absent. This reveals an increased sensitivity of ACVR1-R206H signaling to Acvr2b dosage, compared to wild-type ACVR1.

In both species, all sncRNA subtypes are expressed, but only microRNAs (miRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) display cell type-specific patterns. In mice and humans, miRNAs and snoRNAs from the Dlk1-Dio3 locus were upregulated in the inner cell mass (ICM). Human trophectoderm (TE) is enriched with primate-specific C19MC miRNAs, which show relatively low expression in the ICM.

Amblypygi (whip spiders) is an ancient order of arachnids with remarkably conserved body shape, despite their global distribution.

Here, we analysed how body size and shape of 69 species of Charontid whip spiders evolved in response to climate and habitat. We used Generalized Least Squares to test if bioclimatic variables and habitat influence the variation in body size and shape. Additionally, we fitted alternative macroevolutionary models to body size and shape using Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood approaches. Finally, we estimated phylogenetic signal and tested for differences in evolutionary rates among habitats. Body size decreased slightly with increasing mean annual temperatures and increased with increasing yearly precipitation. Body size evolved following an increasing trend, while the adaptive landscape of body shape seems to have distinct optima, but not rates, for each habitat. Our results support both Cope-Deperet's and Bergmann's rule, while habitat had a lesser role.

F.; Mooers, A. O.; Otto, S. P.", "abstract": "Understanding the variability of processes leading to the emergence of new lineages is one of the major tasks of macroevolution as a scientific field. Recent years have seen the rise of rate-variable diversification models and metrics that estimate the rates of species diversification at the tips of phylogenetic trees and are thus potentially useful for predicting future evolutionary success of individual species. These methods use various assumptions about the variability and heritability of diversification rates. However, the general performance of rate-variable diversification methods have never been consistently tested against real world data. Here we explore the capacity of multiple rate-variable diversification methods to predict near-future diversification using temporal slices of empirical fossil and extant phylogenies. We do this using a newly developed approach similar to generalized linear models, allowing us to quantify the relationship between predictor tip rates and subsequent diversification rates derived from a probability distribution of numbers of daughter species. We find that tip rates estimated from current methods have non-zero but limited capacity to predict diversification in both fossil and extant phylogenies. The quality of the predictions depends not only on the methods used but also on the specific phylogeny, suggesting that diversification dynamics in some taxa may be more predictable in principle. Our results suggest that future cladogenesis can be, to a certain extent, predicted using existing tip rate methods, but the quality of such predictions is highly variable and depends on factors that are difficult to evaluate in practical applications.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Intriguingly, it is known that the splicing isoform EDA+FN1 is a marker and driver of myofibroblast differentiation, but the alternative splicing landscape of myofibroblast is unknown. Here, we performed a high-throughput transcriptomic approach by RNA-Seq in a primary skin fibroblast line and uncover more than 250 splicing isoforms associated with TGF{beta}-induced myofibroblasts using two different bioinformatic pipelines. This splicing profile highlights a distinct layer of regulation when compared to the global gene expression profile of myofibroblasts. A 5 alternative splicing event (ASE) signature [ACTN1-19A/19B; COL5A1-64A/64B; COL6A3 exon 4; FLNA exon 30 and TPM1-6a/6b] was further validated by ddPCR and AS-PCR and retrieved in publicly available RNA-Seq datasets describing other TGF{beta}-stimulated lung and skin fibroblasts.

In the present study, we have developed the area-based methods for selecting near-native interfaces for protein-protein interactions. The quantitative relationship between different areas in the predicted structure of protein-protein complex and the predicted accuracy was explored using linear and nonlinear models.

A major limitation arises from Rubisco, the central carbon-fixing enzyme, which catalyzes oxygenation reactions that waste up to 40 percent of fixed carbon through photorespiration. While C4 photosynthesis offers greater efficiency, its anatomical and regulatory complexity has hindered its transfer into C3 crops. Here we propose and evaluate a novel intermediate strategy, termed C3.5 photosynthesis, which reimagines mitochondria as carbon-recycling organelles to enhance Rubisco efficiency. Using Arabidopsis as a model, we integrate computational modeling, simulated phenotyping datasets, and machine learning approaches to benchmark the feasibility of coupling mitochondrial bioenergetics to chloroplast carbon assimilation. We first construct predictive frameworks showing how mitochondrial CO2 release can be recaptured and redirected to chloroplasts through engineered organelle tethers and synthetic transporters. We then simulate the redox and energetic trade-offs of rewiring FoF ATP synthase to power bicarbonate transport, providing mechanistic insights into the balance between ATP cost and carbon gain. Our results demonstrate that C3.5 photosynthesis could, in principle, increase net carbon assimilation by 20-50 percent under fluctuating light and heat stress, without the structural reprogramming required for C4 pathways. This work establishes a conceptual and computational foundation for repurposing mitochondria as carbon-recycling hubs, bridging fundamental organelle biology with translational strategies in crop engineering.

As a part of the analysis, candidate genes are often analyzed through Gene-Gene interaction (GGI) networks. These networks can become very large, necessitating efficient methods to reduce their complexity. Active Module Identification (AMI) is a common method to analyze GGI networks by identifying enriched subnetworks representing relevant biological processes. Multiple AMI algorithms have been developed for biological datasets, and a comprehensive assessment of these algorithms and a comparative analysis of their behaviors across a variety of use-cases are crucial for their appropriate applications. Results: In this study, we use the Empirical Pipeline (EMP) to evaluate four AMI algorithms -- PAPER, DOMINO, FDRnet, and HotNet2 -- on their ability to produce context-specific enrichment. When testing the algorithms on four biological datasets, our results reveal that no single algorithm outperforms the others across all datasets. Moreover, the output modules are often dissimilar, suggesting that different algorithms capture complementary biological signals. Our results suggest that a comprehensive analysis requires the aggregation of outputs from multiple algorithms. We propose two methods to this end: a spectral clustering approach for module aggregation, and an algorithm that combines modules with similar network structures called Greedy Conductance-based Merging (GCM). Conclusions: Overall, our results advance our understanding of AMI algorithms and how they should be applied.

Formed by the phase separation of biomolecules, condensates possess a wide range of mechanical responses. However, how condensate viscoelastic responses are encoded in the chemistries of their constituents---such as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)---are not well understood. Here, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to connect measurable condensate viscoelasticity to the architectural heterogeneity and dynamic reconfigurability of associative networks formed by IDPs. Using a residue-resolution coarse-grained model, we characterize biologically relevant and synthetic condensates, demonstrating that their temperature sensitivity of elasticity is sequence dependent and modeled by exponential scaling laws. We interrogate condensate mesh heterogeneity via entanglement spacing, finding that entropy-driven structural heterogeneity and reduced IDP hydrophobicity favor condensate elasticity. Furthermore, we construct graph-theoretical representations of condensates and find that interaction network topologies with an abundance of redundant node pathways translates to more load-bearing paths for mechanical stress storage. Strikingly, we discover that elastic coupling of IDPs within condensates emerges when single-molecule shape memory timescales approach meshwork reconfiguration timescales. Akin to a condensate Deborah number, this interplay of timescales for molecular and microstructural processes dictates how restoring elastic forces propagate and are stored across IDP networks; linking condensate microstructure dynamics directly to mechanical responses. Taken together, our work provides a conceptual framework of how condensates act as stress-responsive biomaterials; helping illuminate how cells exploit condensate mechanics to sense and regulate their internal environment and opening avenues for the design of condensates with programmable material properties.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Bovine colostrum is particularly enriched in EVs, which carry a unique cargo of proteins involved in immune regulation, development, and cellular signaling. However, despite promising bioactive effects in various fields, little is known about their potential as anti-cancer agents. Here, we demonstrate that colostrum-derived EVs (Col-EVs) exert a potent and specific anti-proliferative effect on gastrointestinal cancer cell lines, independent of apoptosis induction. Using a multi-modal approach combining proteomics and functional assays, we show that Col-EVs induce a reversible proliferative arrest through transcriptional repression and chromatin and nuclear remodeling. Col-EV treatment leads to widespread dysregulation of RNA processing and transcriptional machinery, including the downregulation of splicing factors and chromatin regulators essential for cell cycle progression. These molecular changes are accompanied by chromatin compaction, nuclear reorganization, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Notably, these effects do not induce cell death and are reversible upon EV removal, suggesting a modulatory mechanism rather than cytotoxicity. Furthermore, Col-EVs enhance the efficacy of DNA-targeting chemotherapies such as 5-fluorouracil, indicating their potential as adjunctive agents in cancer treatment.

Finally, systemic treatment with the EGFR and MMP-2 cleavage fusion significantly reduced tumour size in MDA-MB-468 xenograft models, confirming in vivo efficacy against cancer cells and acceptable systemic toxicity.

Understanding spatiotemporal cellular interplay and tissue organization is crucial for advancing tumor biology and improving patient stratification. Spatially resolved proteomics, such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC), offers a powerful approach to dissect the TME. We present an end-to-end computational pipeline for robust quantitative analysis of large-scale IMC datasets, addressing the challenge of batch effects through image-level contrast adjustment. Applying this framework to 813 tissue regions encompassing over 4 million cells from 63 TNBC patients, we revealed distinct spatial arrangements of cell types between chemotherapy responders and non-responders. Non-responders showed reduced cytotoxic T-cell infiltration into tumor regions and increased spatial co-localization between fibroblasts and macrophages, a pattern that persisted and intensified after chemotherapy treatment. To integrate these complex spatial-molecular relationships, we used graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict treatment response from pre-treatment samples with AUROC=0.71. Interpretability analysis identified B7H4, CD11b, CD366, and FOXP3 as the most predictive protein markers, with fibroblasts, cancer cells, and CD8+ T cells being the most informative cell types. This study introduces a scalable analytical framework for spatial proteomics with interpretable predictions, suggesting features of tissue state that could guide treatment decisions in TNBC and further our understanding of the spatial determinants of therapeutic response.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that tumor-associated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) influence platinum drug efficacy. Due to the complexity of GAG biosynthesis and the involvement of multiple enzymes, traditional transcriptomic and proteomic approaches cannot accurately estimate their levels or correlation with patient response and survival. To address this, we quantitatively analyzed the full compositional profile of GAGs in OC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with known carboplatin sensitivity. Our results revealed a significant correlation between carboplatin resistance and high levels of the predominant GAG sequence, chondroitin-4-sulfate (C4S). Further investigation in cellular models demonstrated that high GAG expression reduces carboplatin uptake, DNA adduct formation, and tumor accumulation, whereas the opposite effect was observed for Triplatin, a GAG-targeting platinum agent. These trends were further validated in vivo, where treatment of OC PDX models with varying C4S levels confirmed that carboplatin efficacy decreases while Triplatin activity increases in tumors with high C4S expression. Based on these findings, we established a C4S cut-off score to predict tumor sensitivity, identifying a threshold above which tumors are likely to be carboplatin-resistant but Triplatin-sensitive. Analysis of patient tissue microarrays estimated that 40 to 83% of OC tumors, depending on subtype, exhibit high C4S expression. Collectively, these findings highlight the predictive power of C4S as a biomarker for platinum response and support the clinical evaluation of Triplatin as a targeted treatment for patients with carboplatin-resistant tumors expressing high levels of C4S.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we describe a structure-activity relationship (SAR) campaign to optimize a small molecule CD28 inhibitor. Guided by biophysical profiling and functional assays, derivatives of the 8VS and 22VS chemotypes were evaluated, leading to the identification of BPU11 as a chemically tractable lead with improved pharmacokinetic stability, aqueous solubility, and plasma persistence. BPU11 consistently disrupted CD28-B7 interactions across biochemical and cellular systems, and potently suppressed T-cell activation in both a tumor-PBMC co-culture and a human PBMC-mucosal tissue model, functionally mimicking the biologic antagonist FR104.

These cells can be genetically engineered in vitro and transplanted into host animals following ablation of endogenous microglia, enabling repopulation of the brain parenchyma. However, current replacement strategies often rely on radiation or transgenic models, limiting their clinical relevance. CSF1R inhibitors offer a more translational approach to microglia ablation, though surviving host cells can compete with transplanted microglia during repopulation. In this study, we successfully ablated endogenous microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor in adult mice and developed a method to transplant engineered microglia expressing Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in a doxycycline-inducible manner. To enhance engraftment, transplanted cells also expressed a constitutively active CSF1R mutant (caCSF1R). BDNF-expressing transplanted microglia spread through large areas of host mice brains, displayed similar morphology and transcriptional profile to repopulating host microglia, and responded to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Treatment with doxycycline resulted in increased BDNF expression and TrkB phosphorylation in the host brain. Expression of caCSF1R provided transplanted cells with a competitive advantage over endogenous repopulating cells, resulting in the accelerated spread of the transplants. Our results demonstrate the functional integration and therapeutic potential of microglia as vehicles for delivering neurotrophic factors to the brain in a controllable manner.

MET not only harms aquatic organisms but can also alter their ecological interactions, such as those between bloom-forming cyanobacteria and their chytrid parasites. Chytrids are zoosporic fungi that naturally regulate cyanobacterial populations. Although it is known that MET affects cyanobacterial metabolism and reduces chytrid fitness, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. Here, we investigate the transcriptional profiles of the toxigenic bloom-forming cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii and its obligate chytrid parasite Rhizophydium megarrhizum exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of MET. We found that MET alters the expression of genes associated with key physiological processes in both organisms. In P. agardhii, it affected genes involved in photosynthesis, gas vesicle synthesis and membrane stability. In R. megarrhizum, it influenced genes related to flagella assembly, developmental transitions and secondary metabolite production. Moreover, the distinct expression pattern observed under combined MET exposure and chytrid infection suggests a synergistic effect on the cyanobacterial host. By impairing chytrid-mediated control of cyanobacteria, MET may allow cyanobacteria to overgrow, thereby promoting bloom formation.

Depending on what the cells needs for protein synthesis, ribosomes exist in various functional states, and when cells face stressful conditions, their ribosomes may enter into an inactive hibernation state. In bacteria, this ability to become dormant through ribosomal hibernation plays a crucial role in their survival, especially when the cells are targeted by ribosome-targeting antibiotics. The phenomenon occurs when ribosomes bind with hibernation factors. In this work, we examine how these special proteins interact with ribosomes from four different Gram-negative pathogens, and how this leads to translation inhibition, reporting the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of hibernating ribosomes from P. aeruginosa, E. hormaechei, K. quasipneumoniae and A. baumannii. We show that these ribosomal complexes contain either short HPF or YfiA tightly bound to the 30S A-site, P-site, and even occasionally to the E-site.

The skeletal muscle CaV1.1 and the cardiac/neuronal CaV1.2 represent two structurally closely related channels with particularly slow and fast activation kinetics, respectively. Both channel paralogs associate with the auxiliary calcium channel subunit 2{delta}-1, which is a known regulator of activation properties. By expressing CaV1.1 and CaV1.2 with and without 2{delta}-1 in a new double-knockout muscle cell line, we demonstrate that 2{delta}-1 regulates activation kinetics of the two channels in opposite directions. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed a string of charged amino acids connecting 2{delta}-1 to the intrinsic speed-control mechanism of voltage-sensing domain I (VSD I) in CaV1.1.

Immunotherapeutic approaches hold significant promise for enhancing immune-mediated disease control. However, successful immunotherapy relies on identifying CML-associated antigens and achieving robust antigen presentation. Protein kinases are central regulators of signaling, and protein turnover, influencing which peptides are processed and presented on HLA molecules. Indeed, previous works with CDK4/6 or MEK inhibitors showed that kinases influence immune recognition of cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of the immunopeptidome by kinases inhibitors treatment remained unclear. Here, we investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of key kinases, including BCR-ABL, JNK and LCK, could be leveraged to reshape the immunopeptidome of CML cells, enhancing the exposure of specific tumor-associated antigens. By employing high-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based immunopeptidomics, we quantified more than 20,000 HLA-I peptides. Pharmacological suppression of LCK, JNK and BCR-ABL drastically remodels the antigen landscape, impacting the exposure of about 4,000 HLA-I ligands. By integrating immunopeptidomics, phospho-immunopeptidomics, and proteomic, our study revealed three complementary molecular mechanisms of kinase-dependent antigen control: direct phosphorylation of HLA-I peptides (i), modulation of source protein stability (ii), and control of transcription factors governing antigen expression (iii). Moreover, comparative HLA ligandome analysis of benign hematological specimens and CML primary samples identified a panel of about 90 frequently presented CML-exclusive peptides, whose presentation can be significantly increased by LCK and JNK inhibition.

Self-organizing development, such as flexible vasculature formation, depends on the auxin canalization manifested by the gradual formation of auxin transport channels via the feedback between auxin signalling and transport. Herein, we identify MAKR6 as a key, novel component of this feedback. MAKR6 expression highly accumulates in vascular cells and is tightly regulated by auxin via the Aux/IAA-ARF-WRKY23 transcriptional network. MAKR6 is indispensable for auxin canalization-dependent processes including leaf venation, vasculature regeneration, and de novo auxin channel formation from the local auxin sources. Mechanistically, MAKR6 directly interacts with the PIN1 auxin transporter to modulate its trafficking and polarization. MAKR6 also associates with and links two key receptor-like kinase (RLK) complexes involved in canalization, TMK1/4 and the CAMEL-CANAR.

VOC analysis of the shared rhizosphere headspace and leaf emissions revealed that poplar plants could perceive and respond to fungal identity solely through airborne cues. The root-zone headspace contained fungus specific sesquiterpene fingerprints that remained similar after three and six weeks of co-cultivation: Pathogen-derived VOCs induced constant high sesquiterpene emissions from the root-zone, whereas mycorrhiza caused low but targeted emissions of specific sesquiterpenes. In contrast, saprotrophic VOCs caused a temporal shift in root-zone VOC pattern, with increased sesquiterpene emissions after six weeks. Fungal VOC exposure also altered leaf VOC emissions, enriching alkanes, esters and monoterpenes. Initially, leaf VOC emissions were fungal lifestyle-specific but they converged over time, indicating systemic signal integration of belowground signals. These findings demonstrate that trees can discriminate 'friend versus foe' through VOCs alone, extending pattern recognition theory beyond contact dependent cues.

Here, we introduce Validator Barcodes (VBCs), a set of eight short barcodes (6-9 nucleotides in length). This compact set of barcodes improves PCR efficiency and facilitates PCR primer designs. Also, like UMIs, the VBCs may be used to estimate the number of template molecules (RNA or DNA). Using VBC-labeled primers for TCR and BCR repertoire profiling from PBMCs produces highly comparable results and similarly template values to those obtained through UMI-based assay counts. Overall, VBCs are a useful and simpler alternative to UMIs in assaying TCR and BCR repertoires.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Limited reports have elucidated the role of one-carbon metabolism and its impact on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in tuberculosis (TB). In this study, reanalysis of the earlier reported scRNAseq data of alveolar macrophages (AMs) from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv-infected C57BL/6 mice showed downregulation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and neutral amino acid transporter, i.e. Slc7a5. PHGDH is involved in the glycine cleavage system, and its downregulation in the AMs indicates that extracellular methionine mainly contributes carbon units for one-carbon metabolism. But lower expression of Slc7a5 reflects lower methionine uptake in macrophages in the Mtb-infected group. Global metabolome analysis of the Mtb-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) showed a major biochemical shift at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) with perturbation of various nodes connected to the one-carbon metabolism, including serine-methionine metabolism and polyamine synthesis. A significantly low intracellular serine, methionine and polyamine levels with a high adenine, hypoxanthine, guanine and reduced-glutathione (GSH) levels indicated that the flux from one-carbon metabolism is diverted towards nucleotide salvage and glutathione production at 24 hpi in the Mtb-infected BMDMs. Proteome profiling of these Mtb-infected BMDMs indicated increased nucleotide salvage, glutathione production and a suppressed IL-1 response. This rewiring of the metabolic pathways suppressed the immune response and dampened the mycobacterial clearance. Further, methionine (1 mM) supplemented BMDMs upon Mtb infection showed improved cell viability with accelerated mycobacterial clearance by producing significantly higher IL-1{beta} levels. Methionine supplementation, to C57BL/6 mice, in drinking water for two weeks, helped in enhancing mycobacterial clearance in lungs, spleen and BMDMs by increasing pro-inflammatory response, especially by increasing IL-1{beta} and IFN-{gamma} production. Supplementation of methionine also increased Mtb-specific TNF--producing activated CD4+ cells in the spleen. So, methionine supplementation in macrophages and mice helped in mounting a better acute pro-inflammatory response, which could be used as a dietary supplementation strategy to improve clinical outcomes in TB.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether P2D1, a tailocin produced by the plant pathogen Dickeya dadantii 3937, can act against environmental bacteria phylogenetically distant from Dickeya spp. Screening 480 soil and rhizosphere isolates from three distinct plant-associated habitats in Poland, we identified nine Pseudomonas spp. strains susceptible to tailocin P2D1. Whole-genome sequencing and phenotype profiling revealed that these isolates spanned multiple clades, including taxa related to P. germanica, P. tensinigenes, and P. parakoreensis. The D. dadantii mutant lacking genes encoding tailocin sheath and tube proteins lost antagonistic activity against Pseudomonas isolates, confirming that tailocins alone mediate the observed killing. Plant tissue assays revealed that six of the P2D1-susceptible strains were non-pathogenic and could mitigate D. dadantii-induced soft rot on potato. In contrast, three isolates related to P. tensinigenes were able to cause rot on their own under permissive conditions. Together, these findings demonstrate that P2D1 tailocin extends its activity to ecologically co-occurring but taxonomically distant Pseudomonas, suggesting that conserved receptors underline cross-genus targeting. More broadly, our results add to the limited evidence for tailocin activity beyond kin killing and therefore challenge the prevailing paradigm of kin-restricted tailocin specificity. They further suggest that tailocins may influence microbial community assembly across taxonomic boundaries, while their in vivo roles remain understudied.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

The nasal epithelium is the first respiratory epithelium that is exposed to inhaled airborne pathogens. As a result, it is crucial to model host-pathogen interactions occurring in this tissue. To facilitate the efficient modelling of these interactions, we have developed a method to generate de novo apical-out nasal organoids from nasal epithelial cell aggregates. Optimisation of this method revealed a stark tissue-specific effect of the culture temperature, as apical-out nasal organoids were generated in much higher efficiency at 32.5C, compared to more widely used temperatures of 37C. These organoids are composed of ciliated, basal and goblet cells and are produced in a completely standardised and scalable manner, devoid of any extracellular matrix hydrogel. Moreover, they displayed high homogeneity in size and cellular composition, as well as susceptibility to viral infections and capability to model antiviral drug responses.

The UK's Net-Zero 2050 strategy, alongside terrestrial measures, prioritises large-scale offshore wind development, creating opportunities to integrate marine NbS into Net-Zero plans. Consequently, aligning decarbonisation targets with conservation goals demands marine spatial planning and adaptive Marine Protected Area (MPA) networks. While estimates suggest UK marine systems store ~244 million tonnes of organic carbon, sequestration potentials remain poorly quantified. We developed marine spatial plans for the UK and estimated carbon sequestration potentials. We divided the UK Exclusive Economic Zone into four zones (Open, Conservation, Oil, and Energy) using Marxan with Zones under two scenarios: (1) Existing MPAs locked-in, and (2) Unconstrained. Conservation Zones were defined as regions with minimal human activity. Planning incorporated 14 features: four species distribution models (SDMs), including the first UK-wide maerl SDMs, habitat suitability maps for subtidal macroalgae, and relevant stakeholder maps, such as offshore wind and oil fields. Conservation zones overlapped with >70% of current MPAs and complemented them by isolating biodiversity from anthropogenic activities, such as ports, without compromising renewable energy targets. We estimated sequestration rates of 533 - 625 kt C yr-1, with restoration contributing an additional 0.11 - 0.12 kt C yr-1 by 2040.

We conducted a manipulative tethering experiment to quantify size-specific survival of juvenile blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus)across three habitats - seagrass meadows (seagrass), salt marsh edge (SME), and unvegetated sand flats (sand) - in the York River, Chesapeake Bay, USA. We also accounted for spatial orientation, seasonality, and turbidity. Results were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression models. Survival varied with crab size, habitat, and time of year, with an interaction between size and habitat. Smaller juveniles had the highest survival in seagrass, but survival increased more rapidly with size in SME and sand habitats. By 33 mm carapace width (CW), relative survival rates in seagrass and SME were statistically indistinguishable. Meanwhile, survival in sand approached that of seagrass at approximately 45 mm CW. When considered alongside previous growth rate studies, these results suggest that seagrass offers a growth-survival advantage for crabs <15 - 20 mm CW, while salt marsh and sand habitats become increasingly favorable for larger juveniles due to comparable survival and faster growth. Consequently, even across a relatively small size range of the juvenile phase, size-specific patterns in survival differ substantially across structured and unstructured habitats. Our findings align with observed patterns of size-specific habitat use and underscore the complementary nursery roles of seagrass and salt marshes, reinforcing their joint importance in habitat restoration and conservation strategies for juvenile blue crabs.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We statistically assess overfitting in ML tools using log-likelihood scores on unseen sites as primary metric. We deploy a 10-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation approach, partitioning 9,062 empirical and 6,342 simulated MSAs into training (80%) and testing (20%) sites. We conduct inferences using RAxML-NG, IQ-TREE, FastTree, and RAxML-NG ES (a recently released Early Stopping version) on the training MSAs. We store all intermediate improved topologies and subsequently evaluate them via the testing sites. We perform a linear regression on the final segments of the derived testing curves, and statistically evaluate the line slopes via the sign test. Our results indicate that ML tools do not overfit. For RAxML-NG (standard and ES) and IQ-TREE, the overall trend is non-significant for 86-98% of the empirical MSAs, while for less than 1% the tools exhibit overfitting. FastTree shows more positive trends, suggesting premature termination, especially on protein MSAs. Topological accuracy curves on simulated data further confirm that tools do not systematically diverge from the true topology. To complement these findings, we test whether strategies to mitigate overfitting can benefit ML inferences. To this end, we also benchmark a site-based holdout validation (HV) version of RAxML-NG. The results confirm that the overfitting is absent and also indicate that excluding MSA sites substantially reduces phylogenetic signal as well as accuracy.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Focusing on the PKA catalytic subunits, comprised of the paralogs Tpk1 and Tpk3 as well as the isomorphic kinase Tpk2, we employed mass spectrometry to identify their contribution to cellular metabolism, used a GFP-based sensor to follow changes in cytosolic pH, and used BioID to identify unique and shared binding partners.

For HIV-1 protease the mechanism of cleavage by mature protease is well understood in large part because it forms a stable structure that is amenable to x-ray crystallography.

We probed autoproteolysis in HIV-1 using a yeast reporter and mutational scanning. We compared our results with mutational scanning of protease on viral fitness, which integrates both autocleavage and cutting by mature enzyme. We identified 220 mutations that were well tolerated for self-cleavage but not fitness. We analyzed three of these mutations (D30E, W42M and P44L) using independent approaches. All three were capable of efficient self-cleavage in a bacterial assay of autoproteolysis, but had strong defects in mature form for cleavage of a peptide substrate. These separation of function mutations from the mutational scan clustered at hot-spot locations that do not impact autoproteolysis likely because they are conformationally dynamic during self-cleavage. We used the mutational scanning results and molecular simulations to provide models of autoproteolysis conformations.

A.; Kaplan, T.; Hoffman, S.; Bommel, A. v.", "abstract": "Methylation-based epigenetic clocks are among the most accurate tools for predicting chronological age. Although DNA methylation (DNAm) at genomic CpG sites is linked to various regulatory mechanisms, the biological interpretability of epigenetic clocks remains surprisingly limited. One primary mechanism by which DNAm is thought to influence gene regulation is by modulating transcription factor binding activity. In this study, we examine established epigenetic clocks to assess the regulatory potential of their predictive CpGs during the aging process. Our analysis reveals that generally most CpG sites used by epigenetic clocks do not overlap known transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), indicating that changes in TFBS dynamics may not account for prediction accuracy of these models. On the other hand, by identifying age-associated CpGs that overlap TFBSs, we identified transcription factors that may be involved in the aging process. Specifically, the TFBSs of ZBED1, NFE2, CEBPB, FOXP1, EGR1, SP1, PAX5, and MAZ were particularly enriched for age-associated CpGs, while RBPJ, NFIC, RELA, IKZF1, STAT3, and USF2 were significantly protected against methylation changes. By focusing on TFBS-associated CpGs, combined with additional feature selection and engineering steps, we developed an alternative, TFMethyl Clock model, outperforming several existing approaches. Target genes of model-selected, age-predictive CpGs are enriched in the interleukin-1{beta} production and long-chain fatty acid metabolism pathways. In contrast, these CpGs themselves are enriched mainly at binding sites of NR2C2 TF. Furthermore, approximately three-fourths of the target genes downstream of age-predictive CpGs exhibit significant age-related changes, suggesting that our approach captures deeper insights into possible methylation-driven biological aging processes.

Additionally, they are not limited to a specific cell type, but rather show constant expression throughout different tissues. In contrast, the lowest-performed genes generally behave in context-dependent expression patterns, where they include condition-specific biological functions instead of vital biological activities.

Hard X-ray imaging, with its ability to penetrate samples several tens of micrometers thick, offers a complementary approach for high-resolution visualization. A major concern is whether cryo-preserved samples can withstand the handling conditions at synchrotron facilities without excessive icing or devitrification, and whether the radiation exposure during X-ray imaging compromises specimen integrity, thereby hindering subsequent attempts to achieve high-resolution 3D reconstructions via cryo-EM. To evaluate this, we deposited apoferritin samples on a cryo-EM grid, exposed them to varied X-ray doses typical for X-ray tomography experiments at a synchrotron facility, and subsequently analyzed the exposed particles by cryo-EM. Despite the apparent damage sustained throughout the experiment, the samples remained amenable to cryo-EM analysis, with structural details at a resolution of ~4 Angstrom at the highest applied X-ray dose of 100 MGy. By comparison, a similar cryo-EM dataset of the apoferritin particles that were not exposed to X-rays, but were mounted on the same cryo-EM grid, resulted in a 3D reconstruction at 3.1 Angstrom resolution. Thus, while radiation damage may limit the high-resolution information in specimens processed by cryo-X-ray tomography, the cryo-preserved biological material exposed to these high X-ray doses can be still used for subsequent cryo-EM workflows aiming to obtain structural biology insights and intermediate to high resolution.

Its most distinctive feature is the capacity for multiplexing, which is achieved through a process known as Exchange-PAINT. This technique involves assigning orthogonal DNA strands to different targets within a sample and then sequentially adding and removing complementary imager strands that are specific to only one target at a time.

Instead, SLE neutrophils default to vital NET release; a less bactericidal, type I interferon (IFN)-driven process amplified by staphylococcal pore-forming toxins and sustained by elevated systemic IFN levels observed in SLE. Combined treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and interferon-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) blockade restores LDHB expression, NET homeostasis, and bacterial clearance in lupus-prone mice.

Employing multi-seasonal in situ and in vitro experiments, we assessed the biodegradation of six bio-based bioplastic materials in the brackish Baltic Sea and characterised the associated microbial communities with metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Cellulose acetate (CA), polybutylene succinate (PBS), and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) degraded at varying rates across materials, seasons, and experimental settings, with up to 28% weight attrition after 97 weeks in situ (CA) and 56% carbon loss to CO2 after four weeks in vitro (PBS). The three biodegradable plastics developed similar microbial communities with lower richness and different composition from those on the non-biodegradable materials (polyamide, polyethylene, and glass) and in the water column. The microbial populations on the biodegradable plastics included mostly aerobic and facultative anaerobic heterotrophs with a broad carbohydrate metabolism, and with a higher prevalence of denitrification and other nitrogen cycling traits compared to the non-biodegradable materials. Based on the metatranscriptomic signal of key genes involved in CA, PBS, and PHB breakdown, we identified diverse microbial populations that can potentially drive the biodegradation of these materials in the Baltic Sea, many of which encoded the potential to degrade multiple bioplastics.

Proprioceptive dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons are among the most vulnerable cell types in FA, yet the mechanisms underlying their selective susceptibility remain unclear. Here, we developed a primary culture model of embryonic mouse DRG neurons with complete frataxin depletion. This novel model faithfully reproduces key biochemical hallmarks of FA, including Fe-S enzyme deficiency, mitochondrial iron dysregulation, and oxidative stress. Despite long-term survival, frataxin-deficient neurons exhibited a marked reduction in soma size, identifying a previously unrecognized growth phenotype. Mechanistically, this defect was mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) hyperactivation and suppression of mTOR signaling in response to mitochondrial dysfunction and redox imbalance. Restoration of frataxin expression, genetic inhibition of AMPK, or treatment with alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) rescued soma growth, normalize ATP levels and reduce AMPK activation. Our findings uncover AMPK-mTOR dysregulation as a key driver of neuronal growth impairment in FA.

Using chimeric eCLIP in CRISPR-edited IMD1+/+, LIMD1+/-, and LIMD1-/- human small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs), we reveal a transcriptome-wide dependency on LIMD1, an AGO2 adaptor, for effective miRNA targeting and repression. In LIMD1-deficient cells, miRNA loading is uncoupled from productive targeting: despite increased AGO2-miRNA interactions, complexes engage fewer transcripts and sites, reducing occupancy and more than halving both the breadth and depth of targeting. We also observe altered AGO2 positional footprints across targets in LIMD1 deficient cells. LIMD1 dependence is most pronounced at defined RNA contexts: weak (GC-poor) seed pairings, interactions involving evolutionarily young miRNAs or sites that nonetheless form thermodynamically stable duplexes, with these losses particularly enriched in coding sequences of rapidly evolving C2H2-zinc-finger genes. Even within canonical seed repertoires of individual AGO2-miRNAs, LIMD1 is most critical at poorly conserved sites, indicating that LIMD1 broadens miRNA regulation beyond ancient, deeply conserved targets. In culture, LIMD1 deficiency de-represses oncogenic proteins that, in vivo, inversely correlate with LIMD1 levels in normal lung and adenocarcinoma, where LIMD1 is characteristically reduced, and whose dysregulation predicts poor survival. Thus, LIMD1 emerges as a key determinant of miRISC architecture, targeting, and potency, challenging RNA-centric models of miRNA function and exemplifying how adaptor proteins diversify post-transcriptional regulation.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that MAP4 and MAP7D1 selectively partition onto distinct microtubule subsets demarcated by tyrosination and detyrosination, respectively, creating specialized tracks for kinesin motors. MAP4's preferential binding depends on its projection domain, while expanded microtubule lattice states mediate MAP7D1's enrichment on detyrosinated microtubules. Remarkably, rigor kinesin-1 (KIF5B-R) predominantly localizes to detyrosinated, MAP7D1-coated tracks, whereas rigor kinesin-3 (KIF1A) prefers tyrosinated, MAP4-decorated microtubules. We further find that the local density of MAP4 and MAP7D1 on microtubules fine-tunes lysosomal movement and directional transport. Moreover, MAP density is modulated to coordinate lysosomal reorganization in response to nutrient availability. During starvation MAP7D1 density on microtubules increases while MAP4 density decreases, localizing lysosomes to the perinuclear region. Conversely, with nutrient stimulation, MAPD1 density declines, allowing lysosomes to migrate towards the cell periphery. Altering the cellular levels of MAP4 and MAP7D1, either up or down, hinders lysosomal motility, trapping them near the nucleus and impairing their responsiveness to nutrient stimulation. Together, our findings reveal two distinct MAP-PTM circuits, a MAP4-tyrosination-kinesin-3 axis and a MAP7D1-detyrosination-kinesin-1 axis, that govern lysosome positioning for nutrient signalling, highlighting the combinatorial logic of MAP and tubulin codes in shaping lysosomal function.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

In this study, the population genetic structure of O. phacochoerus was investigated using sixteen microsatellite markers. After sampling campaigns that took place between 2020 and 2022, we analyzed 684 ticks from 21 warthog burrows and resting sites from Coutada 9 Game Reserve, Macossa District, Mozambique, and 138 ticks from 3 warthog burrows and resting sites from Gorongosa National Park, Gorongosa District, Mozambique. Burrows and resting sites are regularly used by the common warthog Phacochoerus africanus which is thought to be responsible for the movements of O. phacochoerus between sites. After genotyping, the observed genetic variation followed a model of isolation by distance with a structure at the level of the sampling sites (burrows and resting sites). Gorongosa National Park and Coutada 9 Game Reserve appeared to be completely isolated from each other in terms of gene flow, and Coutada 9 Game Reserve showed a clear signature of a bottleneck effect. Effective population sizes within sampling sites were quite low (4.1 individuals), with an estimated migration rate of 35% and a mean dispersal distance of 209 meters per tick generation. These results suggested frequent tick movements between burrows at a small geographic scale, due to warthog movements between the burrows. As both wildlife conservation areas are positive for African swine fever virus, these results reinforce the suspected role of the ticks in the sylvatic cycle of the virus, as infected ticks could be moved from one burrow to another, maintaining the presence of the virus in several sites of the conservation areas. This confirms the importance of maintaining buffer zones around conservation areas, buffer zones that should remain free of any domestic pigs to prevent vector spillover from the sylvatic cycle to the domestic cycle.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

We have evaluated mrpast's accuracy on a variety of models, including stepping-stone models with asymmetric migrations, changes in effective population sizes, out-of-Africa, and American admixture. We demonstrated mrpast's accuracy using simulated ARGs and inferred ARGs, and its high versatility in jointly inferring all parameters in complex models, including time of demographic events (e.g., population split, admixture), effective population size (e.g., constant, exponential growth), and gene flow (e.g., admixture proportion, migration rate). Extending the three-population out-of-Africa model with asymmetric migrations, we observed significantly more migrations from East Asians to Europeans than from Europeans to East Asians. Notably, mrpast can reliably recover all parameters in an American admixture model, when treating non-admixed Native American as an unsampled (\"ghost\") population. Applying this model to Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Colombian populations, we found that the reconstructed histories of Native and admixed Americans align closely with both historical records and genetic evidence.

Colonisation history of the species remains largely unexplored and so the potential impact on contemporary patterns of genetic differentiation remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a national-scale genetic study of Arctic charr using a genome-wide dataset of SNPs (24,878 SNPs and 410 individuals) and mitochondrial ND1 sequences (238 sequences). We found several mitochondrial haplotypes were shared across Britain, Ireland, and the wider Holarctic suggesting colonisation by multiple sub-lineages of the Atlantic lineage of the species. Genetic differentiation was not correlated with geographic distance among river catchments, highlighting the effect of spatial isolation and genetic drift. Several populations across different river catchments showed atypical ancestries and evidence for genetic mixing, which we speculate are due to asynchronous ice coverage and the presence of ice-dammed lakes.

Computing such a multi-state model is challenging due to a lower data-to-parameter ratio than that for single-state modeling. To address this challenge, additional information could be considered, such as X-ray datasets collected for the same system under distinct experimental conditions (e.g., temperature, ligands, mutations, and pressure).

The model consists of an independent coordinate set for each of several states and the weight of each state under each condition. A Bayesian posterior model density quantifies the match of the model with all X-ray datasets and the force field. A sample of models is drawn from the posterior model density using biased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We benchmark MultiXray on simulated CypA X-ray data.

Sex hormones likely play a role, but the cellular mechanism behind the sex difference is unclear.

This homeostatic and mechanosensitive mechanism, termed pressure-induced lymphatic chronotropy, enables lymph transport to be matched to the filling state of the lymphatic capillaries. We investigated the mechanistic basis of pressure-induced chronotropy using ex vivo contraction assays of mouse popliteal collecting vessels, in which contraction frequency increased >10-fold with a 5 cmH2O pressure change. The contractile, electrophysiological and transcriptional similarities between lymphatic muscle and arterial smooth muscle led us to hypothesize that pressure-dependent chronotropy shares a parallel signaling process to pressure-induce arterial depolarization/constriction. Thus, we investigated two major mechanisms: 1) pressure-induced activation of mechanosensitive cation channels, including TRPC6, TRPM4, PKD1/2, TRPV2 and ENaC, and 2) mechano-activation of GNAQ/GNA11-coupled GPCRs that would generate second messengers to activate those channels. We combined contraction assays with scRNAseq analysis of the respective targets and made maximum use of transgenic mice to avoid non-specific effects of pharmacological inhibitors, particularly those used to block TRP channels. Our findings rule out significant roles for TRP and other mechanosensitive channels implicated in myogenic constriction, as well as channels implicated in ionic pacemaking of other tissues, and instead support a scheme whereby mechano-activation of GNAQ/GNA11-coupled GPCRs generates IP3, which induces SR Ca2+ release through IP3R1 and drives depolarization through the activation of ANO1 Cl- channels.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the relationship between early seed developmental dynamics and final seed weight by comparing two large-seeded and two small-seeded cultivars under control and depodding conditions. Depodding, achieved by retaining a single pod per node, minimized assimilate competition. Final seed weight was positively correlated with cotyledon cell number and duration of the lag phase, which is a key early stage of seed development. Large-seeded cultivars exhibited significantly longer lag phases and higher cotyledon pavement cell numbers than small-seeded cultivars, suggesting that extended lag phases promote enhanced cell proliferation, contributing to increased seed weight. Depodding further increased the cotyledon cell number; however, this response was associated with accelerated embryo development rather than an extension of the lag phase. These findings indicate that both the duration of the lag phase and the rate of early embryo development influence cotyledon cell proliferation and ultimately seed weight.

However, some cactus species grow porous and flexible spines, suggesting fundamentally different functions. Here we demonstrate the mechanism of fog harvesting in the porous spines of Turbinicarpus alonsoi, a cactus native to central Mexico. Surprisingly, we discovered that the spines are highly hygroscopic and straighten when exposed to fog, leading to increased fog water collection rates. Experiments and numerical simulations confirm that straightening is driven by swelling-induced pressure in the cell walls of the spine tissue. Swelling results from capillary imbibition of fog water and predominantly generates expansion in the transverse plane, which causes the pre-curved spines to straighten. Despite their porosity and hygroscopicity, the spines prevent direct absorption of fog water into the living cortex due to the presence of a suberin-rich tissue layer at the spine base that instead promotes surface runoff towards the roots. Our work suggests that hygro-morphing emerges from distinct structural, biochemical and geometric adaptations of cactus spines, and enables a fine modulation of the flow dynamics on the surface of spines.

L.", "abstract": "Aluminium (Al) toxicity is a critical factor that limits plant growth in acidic soils (pH < 5.5) worldwide. Intracellular Al can bind to various biomolecules and significantly affect gene expression, protein biosynthesis, and cell membrane integrity, ultimately inhibiting nutrients and water uptake. This leads to the arrest of root cell divisions and growth. Organic acids (OAs) produced in mitochondrial-related reactions are strongly linked to Al tolerance, as they bind to Al and neutralize its toxic effects. Recently, the manipulation of root cell divisions through DNA checkpoints has been proposed as an alternative to increase Al tolerance. In this context, molecular interactions between these two mechanisms could potentially enhance plant tolerance to Al toxicity. Here, we investigate this topic using a translatome approach, which enables specific analyses of root cell types (namely, whole root, the quiescent centre region, and the cortical region). This approach offers a promising tool for unravelling how mitochondrial metabolism, particularly the TCA cycle, and the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway are interconnected in Al-mitigation process. Our results revealed that the TCA cycle is induced in differentiated cells, with no significant alteration in meristematic cells, while genes associated with cell cycle progression and DNA checkpoints show differential expression across the distinct cell types. Collectively, our data contribute to understand cell-specific internal detoxification mechanism related to Al tolerance in plants. This knowledge could assist crop breeding by providing a better understanding of the cellular physiological responses to Al toxicity.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

While professional hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of aGvHD, the contribution of non-hematopoietic APCs has remained unclear. Here, we show that naive alloreactive CD4+ T cells initially localize and activate specifically within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) before infiltrating target tissues. Using genetic models to selectively ablate MHC class II on endothelial cells (ECs) or hematopoietic cells, we demonstrate that blood endothelial cells (BECs) in SLOs function as APCs, efficiently processing and presenting antigen to prime donor CD4+ T cells. Deletion of MHC class II (MHCII) specifically in ECs substantially attenuates T cell activation and protects mice from lethal aGvHD, whereas selective deletion of MHCII in lymphatic ECs has no effect. Likewise, selective deletion of MHCII in hematopoietic cells also protects mice against aGvHD, suggesting that both cell types contribute to pathogenic allogeneic T cells activation after allo-HCT. Mechanistically, IL-12/IFN{gamma} signaling upregulates MHC class II expression on BECs. These findings identify BECs in SLOs as initiators of alloreactive CD4+ T cell responses and highlight a potential target for preventing aGvHD.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

It negatively impacts cattle health, affects profitability and trade, and can decimate years of genetic improvement towards desirable production traits. It also places a significant burden on the health and well-being of affected farming families. Eradication of bTB re-quires the understanding of local transmission pathways to target effective disease control interventions. Traditional genotyping methods, such as spoligotyping and VNTR analysis, which have previously been used in Wales to understand the epidemiology of M. bovis, have lacked the discriminatory power to accurately identify local transmission pathways. Recently, whole-genome sequencing has replaced traditional genotyping methods for all M. bovis strains isolated from infected animals in Wales. In this study, we characterised the genomic diversity of M. bovis across Wales by analysing the genome sequence of all 379 M. bovis isolates obtained from culture-positive animals in Wales in 2021. Analyses uncovered three main clusters that are geographically distinct. A further three clusters containing fewer isolates were also geographically separated, two of which had particularly large SNP distances compared to the majority of other Welsh isolates, suggesting independent introductions of M. bovis strains that are not endemic to Wales. Fine-scale and epidemiologically relevant genetic structuring was identified within the six main clusters, indicating region-specific evolution, which can drive local disease dynamics.

We conducted a scoping review following Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, searching MEDLINE and Embase (inception to January 2025) for preclinical studies using AI to analyze histology in respiratory disease models. Screening, full-text review, and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Of 6271 studies screened, 29 met inclusion criteria. Most used murine models (76%) and investigated lung cancer (28%), pulmonary fibrosis (24%), or tuberculosis (17%). Hematoxylin and eosin was the most common stain (48%), with others targeting collagen or immune markers. AI tasks included image classification (n=20), segmentation (n=10), and object detection (n=4), predominantly using convolutional neural networks (69%). Preprocessing methods (e.g., stain normalization) were common, but annotation and training practices were inconsistently reported.

Enhanced droplet motility and frequent cell rearrangements reveal this basal tissue fluidization, which is absent in gorilla and mouse neuroepithelia and diminishes in humans at the onset of neurogenesis. Basal fluidization is driven by nuclear movement fluctuations and facilitated by expanded intercellular spaces. Increasing N-cadherin expression in human neuroepithelia to gorilla levels suppresses both nuclear fluctuations and basal fluidity.

PANKs 1-3 are feedback inhibited by the accumulation of acyl-CoAs. However, PANK2 can overcome this inhibition by binding palmitoyl-carnitine in vitro. Previous studies, conducted under glucose-replete conditions, have failed to detect a PANK2-mediated contribution to CoA synthesis since neither PANK2 deletion nor overexpression leads to changes in CoA cellular content. We found that exposure to BSA-conjugated palmitate (PAL-BSA) led to accumulation of both palmitoyl-carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA without evidence of lipotoxicity in HEK293T cells, suggesting that PANK2 was active under these conditions. Isotope tracing experiments with 13C15N-pantothenate showed a significant drop of de novo CoA [m+4] synthesis in PANK2 silenced (siPANK2) cells that was not observed in control or siPANK1 cells. Newly synthesized CoA in control and siPANK1 cells was able to sustain the high production of acetyl-CoA known to occur with metabolic switching to preferential fatty acid oxidation (FAO). In contrast, PANK2-deficient cells failed to increase acetyl-CoA production during PAL-BSA, indicating that FAO is limited by CoA availability in these conditions. Consistently, we observed diminished cellular viability in PAL-BSA-treated siPANK2 cells concomitant with a drop in ATP levels and the activation of starvation biomarkers AMPK and autophagy.

These, among many other traits, enable P. aeruginosa to cause infections, evade host immune responses, and resist treatment with antimicrobial agents. Both the ability to form biofilms and produce virulence factors are regulated via the bacterial cell-cell communication process called quorum sensing. A key molecular event that enables quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is the physical interaction between an enzyme, PqsE and a master quorum-sensing receptor/transcription factor RhlR, which regulates the expression of a wide variety of virulence-associated genes. Previous work identified active site mutations in PqsE that induce a conformational change weakening the interaction with RhlR. These active site mutations weakened the PqsE-RhlR interaction to the extent that several virulence genes were not activated, and the mutant strains of P. aeruginosa failed to colonize the lungs of a mouse. In this study, we designed a series of molecules to probe binding in the active site of PqsE as a strategy for inhibiting the PqsE-RhlR interaction and thus, the activation of RhlR-controlled genes in P. aeruginosa. HJ1 and HJ5 are new molecules that both bind in the active site of PqsE, and while HJ5 appears to bind in an alternate mode compared to HJ1, it does not induce a conformational change to weaken the PqsE-RhlR interaction. Here, we introduce multiple experimental approaches to assess the way in which these new molecules engage in the PqsE active site. HJ5 can serve as a promising starting point for the development of molecules that target the PqsE active site and allosterically inhibit the interaction with RhlR, thus decreasing virulence in P. aeruginosa.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

While computational methods, particularly those using protein language models (pLMs), offer higher-throughput solutions, they often report unexpectedly high performance on multi-species datasets. Here, we introduce the accidental taxonomist hypothesis, proposing that neural networks can exploit the phylogenetic distances across labels in protein datasets rather than genuine interaction features. We show that in PPI datasets with random negative sampling, protein pairs for real PPIs are almost exclusively from the same species, while negatives almost always originate from different species. We then demonstrate that pLM embeddings can be used to accurately distinguish whether two proteins share a taxonomic origin, allowing models to \"cheat\" by learning phylogeny instead of genuine PPI features. By employing a strategic sampling strategy that restricts negative examples to protein pairs from the same species, we reveal a marked drop in model performance, confirming our hypothesis. Compellingly, these strategically trained models still outperform single-species models, suggesting that multi-species data can improve performance if carefully curated. These findings suggest that accidental taxonomist behavior is a particularly influential confounder for PPI, and it is also broadly applicable to any supervised-learning protein dataset.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

The evolutionary constraints that shape these profiles and the underlying physical and biological principles remain unclear. To address this question, we develop a Mutation-Stability-Activity (MSA) model of enzyme structure evolution. In MSA, mutations arise randomly and fix with probabilities that depend on their effects on folding stability, {Delta}{Delta}G, and catalytic activation energy, {Delta}{Delta}G{ddagger}, scaled by two selection-strength parameters, aS and aA. To calculate {Delta}{Delta}G and {Delta}{Delta}G{ddagger}, and predict mutant structures, we use the coarse-grained Linearly Forced Elastic Network Model (LFENM). Applied to 34 enzyme families, MSA recapitulates observed structural divergence profiles. To identify which constraints shape these profiles, we compare four progressively complex nested models: uniform divergence (M0), mutation model (MM), mutation-stability model (MS), and the full mutation-stability-activity model (MSA). Each successive model provides improved fit to observations, demonstrating that mutation, stability, and activity constraints influence structural divergence profiles. Decomposing MSA predictions shows that the relative contributions of the mutation, stability, and activity components vary widely among enzyme families. We find that contributions vary among families because underlying factors vary: mutation contributions depend on internal flexibility heterogeneity, while stability and activity contributions depend on their respective external selection strengths (aS, aA). MSA provides quantitative, family-level estimates of these selection strengths, enabling future studies to link them to context-level properties such as expression, metabolic role, and specificity.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to evaluate the plasticity of TIME in paediatric solid tumours, investigate its longitudinal evolution, and identify time-dependent immune alterations. Transcriptomic data from longitudinal samples of 27 paediatric patients (<21 years old) with relapsed or refractory solid tumours were analysed, encompassing 70 timepoints: 16 diagnoses and 54 successive relapses. TIME plasticity was assessed using gene expression clustering and immune cell infiltration enumeration. Patient-adjusted longitudinal analyses were performed using generalised linear mixed models (glmmSeq), adjusted for age and sex. Temporal associations of immune changes were further explored using dynamic regression models. Thirteen patients exhibited significant changes in their TIME profile, indicating high TIME plasticity. Over time, the TIME shifted toward a tolerogenic and immunosuppressive state, characterised by decreased activity in immune pathways (e.g., T cell receptor signalling) and enrichment of tolerogenic (e.g., macrophage differentiation) and oncogenic pathways (e.g., IL6-JAK-STAT3). The core enrichment of upregulated pathways contained key immunosuppressive factors: immune checkpoints (CTLA-4), tumour-associated macrophage activators (CSF1/CSF1R), T-regulatory cell activators (TGFB1), and immunosuppressive genes (IL10RA). This study provides evidence that the TIME in paediatric solid tumours is plastic and remodels towards immune depletion and tolerogenicity.

Here we investigate how stability and rapid switching can be combined in a discrete recurrent circuit of the fly navigation center. h{triangleup}K and PFG neurons are recurrently connected in a ring structure. Using in vivo imaging, we find that these two populations exhibit shared persistent bump activity that turns on with odor and terminates at the end of a goal-directed upwind run. Using whole-cell recordings, we show that persistence in h{triangleup}K depends on recurrent signalling, and that h{triangleup}K receives slow recurrent excitation and fast inhibition from its synaptic partners. Computational modeling reveals that this combination of slow excitation with fast inhibition yields stable and tuneable persistent attractor dynamics. Next we examine the mechanisms that allow this activity bump to be rapidly turned on and off. We find that while the PFG bump tracks heading continuously, the h{triangleup}K bump is suppressed during turns, and only becomes active during straight goal-directed runs. We can reproduce these dynamics in our model by using inhibition to dynamically uncouple activity in h{triangleup}K from PFG. When h{triangleup}K is inhibited, PFG neurons follow their inputs from the compass system; when h{triangleup}K is disinhibited, recurrent interactions lock this input into place, forming a heading memory. Consistent with this model, we find that inhibitory inputs onto h{triangleup}K increase during turns and are suppressed during odor input and goal-directed upwind runs.

To assess photoreceptor specificity of Sildenafil, we tested Gnat1 (rod-deficient, cone-only) and Gnat2 (cone-deficient, rod-only) mouse models. Sildenafil completely removed visually evoked responses in Gnat1 retinas, but not in Gnat2, demonstrating preferential inhibition of cone PDE6. These results show that cone-selective suppression of phototransduction is sufficient to abolish Off-pathway signaling, reduce high-frequency visual sensitivity, and alter RGC receptive-field tuning. Beyond providing a mechanistic explanation for the visual side effects of PDE5/6 inhibitors, this establishes a pharmacological model to mimic early cone dysfunction and study inner retinal adaptation.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

While classically considered to be brain disorders, increasing evidence suggests involvement of the gut, with alpha-synuclein aggregates potentially propagating to the brain via the vagus nerve. Evidence also suggests that the vermiform appendix is particularly susceptible to alpha-synuclein aggregation, and appendectomy impacts the onset of Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in the vermiform appendix remains poorly understood. To explore this, we assessed aggregation properties in postmortem appendix tissues from healthy controls and synucleinopathy patients using the alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (alpha-synuclein-SAA) and performed total RNA sequencing alongside differential bisulfite-hybridization-based DNA methylation analysis in the same tissues to investigate the molecular underpinnings. Moreover, we determined alpha-synuclein cleavage patterns by cataloging soluble alpha-synuclein proteoforms from postmortem substantia nigra and post-surgical appendix tissues using top-down mass spectrometry (TD-MS). Alpha-synuclein-SAA was positive in appendix samples for 68.75% of synucleinopathy patients and 6.6% of controls. Genomic profiling revealed dysregulated expression of genes linked to protein folding/degradation, immune/inflammatory responses, and ciliary dynamics in synucleinopathy appendix tissues. TD-MS identified 65 distinct alpha-synuclein proteoforms in the substantia nigra and appendix, with 9 unique to the appendix. Further, in silico modeling revealed higher aggregation propensity of alpha-synuclein proteoforms in the appendix versus substantia nigra. Together, our findings suggest that a tissue environment of alpha-synuclein dysproteostasis in the appendix has the potential to contribute to the development of synucleinopathies.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Understanding how long GABA is free in the extracellular space is key to understanding how inhibition controls activity but has been technically challenging. Estimates of GABAs persistence from GABAA and GABAB recordings range from tens of milliseconds to multiple seconds, but may reflect receptor properties rather than extracellular GABA dynamics. Using the fluorescent GABA sensor, iGABASnFr, in the mouse cerebral cortex, we show that GABA rapidly disperses (tens of milliseconds) from sites of release sites via diffusion rather than GATs. This GABA then accumulates in the extracellular space, where GATs require hundreds of milliseconds to remove extracellular GABA following its release, and even longer when the local density of GABA release is elevated. This extracellular summation of GABA can act hetero-synaptically by activating and/or desensitizing both extra-synaptic and neighboring synaptic receptors. Together these findings reveal a stark disconnect between phasic IPSC signals, which rapidly depress, and extracellular GABA, which strongly accumulates, raising new questions about how GABAergic inhibition works to shape network function.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Emerging evidence suggests that the immune system, particularly T-cell-mediated responses, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PD. However, the heterogeneity of these immune responses across species and preclinical models with varying regenerative capacities remains poorly understood. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of T-cell infiltration, astroglial reactivity, and DAergic neuronal loss across multiple models and species. These included acute DAergic degeneration induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), genetically modified mice with accumulation of aSyn (Thy1-aSyn L61 model), adult zebrafish exposed to MPTP-induced neurotoxicity and human post-mortem midbrain tissue obtained from PD patients. Zebrafish exhibited transient DAergic neurodegeneration followed by neuronal regeneration and a temporary CD4+ T-cell infiltration alongside a regulated astroglial response. In contrast, MPTP-treated mice showed a permanent neuronal loss, increased astrogliosis and CD8+ T-cell infiltration that was negatively correlated with neuronal survival. In contrast, L61 mice exhibited progressive aSyn accumulation with chronic astrogliosis and CD4+ T-cell infiltration not directly linked to neuronal loss. Unlike age-matched controls, the SN from PD brains displayed DAergic degeneration, aSyn aggregation, and elevated CD3+ T-cell infiltration, which correlated with neuronal loss and aSyn burden. These findings emphasise the species- and model-specific immune profiles underlying PD pathology. Our results reveal that CD4+ T-cells contribute to neuronal regeneration following injury in zebrafish. This process is absent in the MPTP and L61 mouse models, which are instead driven by CD8+ or CD4+, respectively.

Cyanobacteria often interact with their parasitic chytrid fungi, which play a role in controlling their growth. Parasites represent an additional biotic stressor that can alter the effects of pollutants on their hosts. However, the metabolic responses of cyanobacteria to simultaneous exposure to pollutants and parasites remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of abiotic (MET and CB leachate) and biotic (chytrid parasite Rhizophydium megarrhizum) stressors on the metabolic response of the toxigenic cyanobacterium Planktothrix agardhii. Co-exposure to MET and chytrids led to a synergistic effect, inducing oxidative stress, countered primarily by non-enzymatic mechanisms, whereas MET alone had no measurable effect. In contrast, CB leachate alone induced oxidative stress, but this effect was mitigated when cyanobacteria were also infected by chytrids, indicating an antagonistic interaction. This study demonstrates the complexity of cyanobacterial responses to interacting biotic and abiotic stressors and highlights the importance of considering host-parasite interactions in ecotoxicological assessments of cyanobacteria.

Through a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified the RAD9A-HUS1-RAD1 (9-1-1) complex as essential for the survival of BRCA2-deficient cells through an ATR-independent mechanism. Loss of 9-1-1 in this context leads to the accumulation of PRIMPOL-dependent gaps that fail to undergo post-replicative repair, resulting in pathological expansion and increased DNA damage. This instability is driven by excessive EXO1-mediated degradation, as EXO1 depletion rescues the phenotype. We further demonstrate that the 9-1-1 complex is required for POL{zeta}-dependent gap filling. We propose a model in which ssDNA gaps, when extended beyond a critical length, become inaccessible to TLS-mediated repair and are fully reliant on homologous recombination.

Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and the pH sensitive marker mCh-CD63-pHluorin to visualize sEV release, we show that GCs stimulate sEV secretion in a neuronal cell line. This process requires the GTPase Rab27a and the enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2), which catalyzes ceramide production and drives sEV formation. We further demonstrate that GCs promote sEV release by activating nSMase2 downstream of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP).

Despite the ease of observation and separation of hemocytes, it is not known whether the circulating hemocytes continue to be produced throughout Daphnia lifespan, and if yes, whether they are generated in any specific hemopoietic tissue or represent a reproducing population as known in some arthropods. We detected de novo DNA synthesis by means of EdU staining in a significant portion of circulating hemocytes in adult D. magna. This portion did not significantly vary among phases of molting/ovary cycle and showed only a slight decrease with age. We did not detect any matching newly synthesized DNA anywhere in any other tissues of adult daphnids, eliminating the hypothesis of the existence of a population of hemopoietic stem cells. Rather, it appears that circulating hemocytes are a reproducing population with mitoses continuing throughout life. Hemocytes showed average ploidy of 4, with a considerable variation around that value indicating that either some endomitoses were also present or a significant portion of hemocytes were sampled in G2. However, while there was no difference in total DNA content measured by Hoechst fluorescence between hemocytes that showed and did not show recent DNA synthesis, among EdU-positive hemocytes there was a positive correlation between Hoechst and EdU fluorescence, indicating that many cells were sampled during S-phase.

In river networks, drying not only alters local environmental conditions but also disrupts hydrological connectivity, reshaping the movement of organisms and resources at the network scale. Leaf litter decomposition- a key ecosystem function in freshwater systems - is particularly sensitive to changes in decomposer communities. We hypothesized that spatiotemporal patterns of drying regulate decomposition by altering the diversity and composition of detritivore macroinvertebrates, bacteria and fungal communities. We combined data from six European drying river networks (DRNs) spanning a wide latitudinal gradient to assess how local drying intensity and regional hydrological connectivity affect decomposition through changes in these decomposer groups. We found that short drying events ([&le;] six dry days) reduced decomposition rates by up to 50% by shifting the control of decomposition from a balanced contribution of fungi, bacteria, and detritivores to one dominated by dry-tolerant but less efficient bacteria. These community shifts persisted after flow resumption, leading to sustained reductions in decomposition even under flowing conditions. Regional connectivity alleviated these negative effects of local drying by facilitating the recovery of more efficient aquatic decomposers through dispersal. However, this effect depended on DRN context. In particular, in southern, more arid DRNs, stronger fragmentation hindered the recovery of decomposer communities after flow resumption. Overall, our results provide mechanistic evidence that spatiotemporal patterns of drying can regulate the linkages between communities and ecosystem functioning in river networks. As drying events become more frequent and prolonged, increasing disruption of these linkages will impact carbon cycling and energy fluxes in freshwater ecosystems under global change.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Here we show that morphological plasticity in the foundational Caribbean reef-builder, Acropora cervicornis, is neutral under ambient temperature conditions, but trades off with thermal stress tolerance during a marine heatwave in the field. While morphological plasticity was previously identified as adaptive in this system, we expand our understanding of plasticity by demonstrating neutral to maladaptive effects depending on the environmental context.

Track-structure Monte Carlo simulations with DNA models have demonstrated their potential to further our fundamental understanding of neutron-induced stochastic risks. To date, most track-structure Monte Carlo studies on the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of neutrons have focused on various types of DNA damage clusters defined using base pair distances. In this study, we extend these methodologies by incorporating the simulation of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair in order to evaluate the RBE of neutrons for misrepairs. To achieve this, we adapted our previously published Monte Carlo DNA damage simulation pipeline, which combines condensed-history and track-structure Monte Carlo methods, to support the standard DNA damage (SDD) data format. This adaptation enabled seamless integration of neutron-induced DNA damage results with the DNA Mechanistic Repair Simulator (DaMaRiS) toolkit. Additionally, we developed a clustering algorithm that reproduces pre-repair endpoints studied in prior works, as well as novel damage clusters based on Euclidean distances. The neutron RBE for misrepairs obtained in this study exhibits a qualitatively similar shape as the RBE obtained for previously reported pre-repair endpoints. However, it peaks higher, reaching a maximum RBE value of 23(1) at a neutron energy of 0.5 MeV. Furthermore, double-strand break (DSB) pairs with a separation distance of 11 nm better matched the RBE for misrepairs than did the DSB clusters defined with base pair distances that were used in previous in silico neutron RBE studies.

Dynamic of the process and rarity of the transcripts associated with elimination make its capturing challenging. To address this, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on embryos actively undergoing B chromosome elimination.

Yet, the mechanisms regulating integrative remodelling of local structures (e.g., loops) and global architecture (e.g., A/B compartmentalization) remain unclear. Here, we investigate this aspect in the context of cardiomyogenesis, characterized by pronounced B-to-A remodelling of several cardiac-specific genes such as TTN. We focus on the roles of the pioneer transcription factor GATA4 and the architectural protein CTCF. Using an inducible knockdown system during human induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation, we show that GATA4 is essential for timely topological activation of key cardiac genes, while partial depletion of CTCF, anticipating physiological downregulation during development, enhances this process. Deletion of a single CTCF binding site on TTN leads to modest gene decompaction and transcriptional activation. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing of chamber-specific cardiac organoids reveals that loss of GATA4 delays differentiation and sustains proliferation of early cardiomyocytes, whereas premature CTCF depletion accelerates yet confounds cardiomyocyte maturation. These findings suggest that CTCF and GATA4 have antagonistic roles on chromatin dynamics during cardiomyogenesis, forming a rheostat that maintains accurate developmental tempo. Disruption of this mechanism may contribute to congenital heart defects caused by mutations in these factors.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

Here, to reveal novel insight into the cardiac sarcomere, the motor unit of the heart, we develop a novel analytical framework to integrate data from over 17,000 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and combine it with two population-scale genomic databases that incorporate data from more than 1.2 million individuals. We integrate in silico genetic predictions of gene variant pathogenicity with 3 dimensional integrative spatial scanning across multiple structural models of cardiac motor proteins. Results reveal both recognized and novel regions of structural variant intolerance across the critical genes of the cardiac sarcomere including novel insights into protein function. We discuss the structural relevance of mutational enrichment in the context of sarcomere organization and destabilization of sequestered myosin leading to hypercontractility seen in HCM, by incorporating the recently defined high-resolution structure of human cardiac myosin filament. We extend and validate these findings through pathogenic variant class enrichment and reveal novel associations with the earlier onset of disease in a large clinical cohort. In summary, our study provides a multi-dimensional framework for integrating structural, genomic, and modeling data to reveal novel insight into the cardiac sarcomere.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

G.; Ledgister, T.-S.; Amin, S.; Barker, J. M.", "abstract": "Background: In 2023, the World Health Organization declared that there is no safe amount of alcohol consumption. It is becoming increasingly clear that even at lower doses, ethanol exposure impacts both the brain and behavior. Emerging work has shown that chronic exposure to lower doses of ethanol may lead to inflexible behaviors and promote aberrant reward seeking. This study aimed to determine the impact of chronic, low-dose ethanol exposure on neural substrates of reward and associated alterations in behavioral strategy in response to change in reward value. Methods: Female and male C57BL/6J mice underwent operant training to self-administer 10% sucrose under a fixed ratio schedule. Once mice showed stable responding, response criteria were graduated to a random interval schedule to promote automated behaviors. Throughout training, mice were given an i.p. injection of low-dose ethanol (0.5g/kg) or saline, 1 hour after each training session. Mice did not receive low-dose ethanol or saline i.p. injections after completion of training. Mice were then tested in PR task in which the reward magnitude of reinforcer was reduced (small or large) or increased (small or large). A subset of mice expressed a retrograde tracer in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and cFos expression within NAc circuits was analyzed following a sucrose self-administration session. Results: Chronic low-dose ethanol exposure altered behavioral responding in female mice following small changes in reward magnitude. Female mice showed divergent response patterns when there was a small reduction in reward magnitude, with greater proportions of ethanol-exposed female mice either increasing or decreasing responding versus controls. Following a small increase, low-dose ethanol female mice significantly increased responding versus controls. Female mice exposed to chronic low-dose ethanol shifted behavioral strategy with a reduction in \"checking\" behavior (magazine entry after a lever press) in response to changes in reward magnitude. This effect was not observed in male mice. Low-dose ethanol altered cFos expression within the prelimbic cortex and its projections to the NAc during reward seeking. Conclusions: Chronic, low-dose ethanol altered behavioral responding and strategy in female mice in response to changes in reward value. During reward seeking, low-dose ethanol exposure impacted prelimbic cortex and its projections to the nucleus accumbens activity in both female and male mice. Future studies should investigate the consequences of chronic low-dose ethanol on both the brain and behavior to further understand what underlying processes drive aberrant reward-seeking behaviors.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

L.; Duan, C.; Zupet, J.; Li, J.", "abstract": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and {beta}-cell dysfunction. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic target due to its roles in promoting insulin secretion, regulating appetite, and enhancing lipid metabolism. However, GLP-1-based therapies face significant challenges, including high production costs, complex delivery methods, and rapid in vivo degradation. To address these limitations, we developed a novel gut delivery strategy using Bacillus subtilis PY79 as a host for the expression of pentameric GLP-1. The genetically-modified strain, B. subtilis JH389, is demonstrated to maintain the same probiotic and antibiotic-sensitivity features belonged to the original strain PY79, and was deposited at the BCCM/LMG collection as B. subtilis LMG P-34037. The pentameric GLP-1 was designed to be digested by intestinal trypsin and to release active GLP-1 monomers capable of (i) resisting inactivativation by DPP- 4 and trypsin, (ii) crossing the intestinal mucosa and (iii) entering the bloodstream. SDS-PAGE and Western blot confirmed the expression of pentameric GLP-1 in B. subtilis JH389, and fecal sample analysis demonstrated the strain gut engraftment. The administration of B. subtilis JH389 increased serum GLP-1 concentration, while also reducing blood glucose levels in a mouse model. Our in vitro and in vivo studies highlights the therapeutic potential of the JH389 strain and support the feasibility of using genetically engineered bacteria as a cost-effective and efficient delivery platform for GLP-1, paving the way for future applications in diabetes and metabolic disorder treatments.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

This strategy may be relevant for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which strongly depends on support from myeloid cells. However, it is unclear how CSF1R expression affects the CLL microenvironment and leukemic progression. To examine this question, we created CLL mice with Csf1r haploinsufficiency to investigate changes in myeloid cells, Csf1r expression, and leukemia progression. Reducing Csf1r expression on circulating monocytes did not change the overall numbers of monocytes or macrophages in blood and lymphoid tissues. Mice with lower Csf1r levels had less leukemia during early disease, but this effect faded with disease progression, and their overall survival was similar to controls. Furthermore, reduced Csf1r expression on macrophages did not affect the survival or migration of patient-derived CLL cells. In summary, our results show that while the CSF1R pathway is important for maintaining the myeloid cells that support CLL, simply reducing CSF1R expression has only a limited effect on disease progression. Attempts to target the CSF1R for leukemic therapy might benefit from a stronger depletion of macrophages or the combination with other agents.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

However, the specific architectural features and structural components sufficient to endow the mechanical properties of the wall remain unclear. Here, we construct a minimal synthetic spherical shell and compare its structural and mechanical properties to those of a plant single-cell system. To eliminate complexities from intercellular connectivity and developmental history, we exploit the ability of plant protoplasts to regenerate cell walls de novo. Compression tests of regenerating protoplasts between parallel plates reveal that wall stiffness increases with wall thickening over time. Despite differences in assembly pathways, architecture, and composition, the synthetic shell exhibits a similar thickness-dependent modulus and similar material stiffness. The synthetic shell, composed of pectin and cellulose layers, mirrors the mechanical behavior of regenerating primary cell walls, suggesting that these components are sufficient to confer key viscoelastic properties in the limit of small deformations. Given the complexity of natural plant cell walls, the synthetic analogue offers a controllable platform to dissect the mechanical contributions of individual wall components.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Accurate motion perception is crucial for navigating complex environments, where sensory information is often derived from multiple modalities. While multisensory cues improve performance in tasks involving stationary stimuli, the integration of dynamic motion cues is less understood. Here, we examined the nature of auditory and visual motion integration and determined whether attentional instructions modulate integration. Sixty participants performed direction discrimination tasks under auditory, visual, and audiovisual conditions, with cueing instructions to attend to one or both modalities. Results showed that visual motion direction estimates were more reliable than auditory ones, and audiovisual estimates were superior to either modality alone. Additionally, visual motion estimates were more stable that auditory motion estimates during direction conflict trials. Reliability-weighted models of integration closely predicted audiovisual performance, demonstrating optimal integration. Sensory dominance (visual vs. auditory) influenced sensitivity to audiovisual motion, with visual dominant participants performing better overall. Our results demonstrate that the perception of audiovisual motion is dominated by vision and is shaped by top-down attention.", "date": "2025-10-07", "journal": ""}
