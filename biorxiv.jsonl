A.; Kirino, Y.", "abstract": "The RNase A superfamily, one of the most extensively studied enzyme families, remains incompletely defined with respect to its endogenous RNA substrates, recognition mechanisms, and physiological functions. Here, we identify eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN/RNase 2) as a principal endoribonuclease mediating tRNA cleavage in the asthmatic lung. Inhalation of house dust mite (HDM) in mice induces robust accumulation of tRNA halves in the lung, coinciding with exclusive upregulation of EDN, but not other ribonucleases. In human lung epithelial cells, internalized EDN cleaves specific tRNAs and generates multiple species of tRNA halves, including immunostimulatory species that activate Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). EDN also promotes the release of extracellular vesicles enriched in these RNAs, implicating them in cytokine production during asthma pathogenesis. Biochemical analyses and structural simulations reveal that EDN recognizes the anticodon loop of tRNA by anchoring the phosphate backbones flanking the cleavage site, thereby precisely positioning the C34-A35 phosphodiester bond for catalysis. Furthermore, the highly efficient cleavage by EDN is mediated by conserved elements, including Arg36 in EDN and U33 and C38 in the target tRNA. Together, these findings establish the endogenous RNA substrate of EDN and uncover a molecular mechanism that links RNase A superfamily activity to immune response.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we analyzed the development and differentiation of the Drosophila embryonic heart at the single-cell level to characterize in detail the genetic expression profiles and phenotypic differences of cardiac cell types during heart morphogenesis. We present an embryonic fly heart cell atlas at unprecedented resolution that integrates the entire catalogue of known heart cells. We identified new gene programs and cell type marker genes that allows characterization of the molecular genetics of fly cardiogenesis in granular detail. In cardioblasts we described the temporal process of cardioblast-to-cardiomyocyte differentiation. Two sets of pericardial cells, likely contributing to cardiomyocyte differentiation, are eliminated by programmed cell death at the end of embryogenesis, whereas as third set continues to shape/influence cardiac function into adulthood. To dissect the gene programs downstream of the cardiac homeodomain transcription factor tinman we analyzed cardiac cells with reduced levels of Tinman. Here we find that Tinman acts both as suppressor and as activator of identified direct Tin-target genes in a cell type-dependent manner. We also found a developmental switch that alters the fate of pericardial cells towards wing heart cell fate and identified an entire wing heart gene program suppressed by Tinman in pericardial cells. Lastly, we find that in pericardial cells Tinman controls a Wingless/WNT receptor switch through selective activation and repression of frizzled and frizzled2, respectively. This study paves the way for investigating other core cardiogenic genes in delineating cardiac regulatory networks.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Neuropixels recordings reveal persistent MSDB neuronal activity that strongly correlates with arousal-related behaviors. We demonstrate that persistent firing (PF) is an intrinsic property of a subset of MSDB neurons, independent of ongoing synaptic input. PF neurons, along with putative GABAergic theta-bursting neurons activity, reliably predicted behavioral initiation. These findings suggest that PF neurons orchestrate the transition from preparatory movements to full behavioral engagement, thus bridging sensory input with locomotor arousal and supporting state transitions in the limbic system.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

It has been proposed that oscillatory alpha-band activity (~10 Hz) aids this process by functionally inhibiting early sensory regions. However, recent studies have challenged this notion. Our EEG and MEG studies aimed to investigate whether alpha oscillations serve as a 'gatekeeper' for downstream signal transmission. We first observed these effects in an EEG study and then replicated them using MEG, which allowed us to localize the sources. We employed a cross-modal paradigm where visual cues indicated whether upcoming targets required visual or auditory discrimination. To assess inhibition, we utilized frequency-tagging, simultaneously flickering the fixation cross at 36 Hz and playing amplitude-modulated white noise at 40 Hz during the cue-to-target interval. Consistent with prior research, we observed an increase in posterior alpha activity following cues signalling auditory targets. However, remarkably, both visual and auditory frequency tagged responses amplified in anticipation of auditory targets, correlating with alpha activity amplitude. Our findings suggest that when attention shifts to auditory processing, the visual stream remains responsive and is not hindered by occipital alpha activity. This implies that alpha modulation does not solely regulate 'gain control' in early visual areas but rather orchestrates signal transmission to later stages of the processing stream.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

These observations challenge functional specialization as a central tenet of Neuroscience, which refers to the notion that distinct brain regions are dedicated to specific aspects of cognition such as working memory or subjective decision-making. Here we develop the concept of bifurcation in space to mechanistically account for the emergence of functional specialization that is compatible with distributed neural coding in a large-scale neocortex. Our theory starts with a departure from the canonical local circuit principle [5] by highlighting differences between cortical areas in the form of experimentally quantified heterogeneities of synaptic excitation and inhibition. We investigated connectome-based modelling of a multiregional cortex for both macaque monkeys and mice, as well as a generative model of a spatially embedded neocortex. During working memory in a simulated delayed response task, surprisingly, we found an inverted-V-shaped pattern of neuronal timescales across the cortical hierarchy as a signature of functional modularity, in sharp contrast to an increasing pattern of timescales during the resting state, as reported previously [6]. Furthermore, our model cortex simultaneously and robustly displays a plethora of bifurcations in space and their associated rich repertoire of timescale profiles across a large-scale cortex; the corresponding functionally defined modules (spatial attractors) could potentially subserve various internal mental processes. This work yields several specific experimentally testable predictions, including an inverted-V pattern of timescales, a measure of comparison between functional modules and structural modules defined by the graph theory, and a new plot for revealing bifurcation in space in neural activity recorded from animals performing different tasks that engage various functional modules. We propose that bifurcation in space, resulting from the connectome and macroscopic gradients of neurobiological properties across the cortex, represents a fundamental principle for understanding the brain's functional specialization and modular organization.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Answering this question has been historically difficult because primates can fail experimental tasks due to a lack of motivation, or succeed through simpler mechanisms. Here we introduce a computational approach for comparative cognition that enables us to quantitatively test the explanatory power of competing accounts. We formalized a collection of theories of NHP social cognition with varying representational complexity and compared them against data from classical NHP studies, focusing on the ability to determine what others know based on what they see. Our results uncovered that, while the most human-like models of NHP social cognition make perfect qualitative predictions, they predict effect sizes that are too strong to be plausible. Instead, theories of intermediate representational complexity best explained the data. At the same time, we show that it is possible for human-like models to capture non-human primate behavior (NHP), as long as we assume that NHPs rely on these representations only about one third of the time. These results show that, in visual perspective taking tasks, NHPs likely draw upon simpler social representations than humans, either in terms of representational complexity, or in terms of use.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Although Notch signalling has been implicated in myogenesis during late embryogenesis, its role in early mesoderm development has been largely unexplored. Endocytosis of the Notch ligand Delta and the Notch receptor extracellular domain, a critical step in Notch pathway activation, has been extensively observed in the ventral mesoderm of the early Drosophila embryo, indicating a potential for Notch signalling activity in this early germ layer. Here, we present evidence that genes critical to mesoderm development require and are responsive to Notch signalling activity. Using a novel light-inducible Optogenetic variant of the Notch intracellular domain (OptoNotch), which affords precise spatial and temporal control over ectopic activation of Notch signalling, in combination with high-resolution fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization and qPCR, we identified a set of mesodermal genes whose expression is directly regulated by Notch signalling. We also provide evidence that Notch signalling indirectly regulates the dorsal-ventral patterning program mediated by the Toll signalling pathway through the Dorsal/ Twist/ Snail gene network. Our findings demonstrate that Notch signalling regulates ventral mesoderm patterning and is critical for establishing the mesoderm-mesectoderm-ectoderm boundary by regulating gene expression patterns and providing negative feedback on the upstream patterning network.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

However, once detected, what effects do these patterns have on conspecific perception? In humans, considerable evidence supports a \"processing bias\" by which people prefer images that match the spatial statistics of natural scenes, likely because the brain has evolved, or develops, to process such scenes efficiently. A direct but untested prediction of this bias is that people should prefer background-matching patterns compared to similar patterns that mismatch the spatial statistics of their surroundings. We conducted an online experiment to test this prediction on over 1,700 participants. Our results show that a preference for the most frequent value of Fourier slope (a measure of spatial structure) observed in natural scenes can be modulated by an additional preference for background-matching. Because the initial stages of perception that underlie the efficient processing of visual scenes are widely conserved among animals, especially vertebrates, we expect this preference for background-matching patterns to be shared by other organisms. Two overlooked potential implications are that some animals may choose display sites with spatial statistics matching their own phenotype, and that the evolution of visual signals will, variously, be constrained or facilitated by such preferences for background-matching patterns.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Escherichia coli MscS is an adaptive osmolyte release valve that regulates turgor in osmotically stressed cells. MscS promptly opens under abrupt super-threshold tensions in the membrane, but at lower and more gradually applied tensions, it silently inactivates from the closed state. A central question has been whether to assign the commonly observed non-conductive conformation with splayed peripheral helices to a closed or inactivated state. We present a 3-A MscS cryo-EM structure obtained in Glyco-DIBMA polymers, which avoid complete lipid removal. Within the complex, we observe densities for endogenous phospholipids intercalating between the peripheral and pore-lining helices. The lipidomic analysis shows a 2-3 fold enrichment of phosphatidylglycerol in Glyco-DIBMA-extracted MscS samples. The computed pressure of these lipids on the protein surface enforces the characteristic kinks in the pore-lining helices, sterically stabilizing the separation of the peripheral helices. Mutations of residues coordinating lipids in the crevices eliminate inactivation, allowing us to classify this group of structures as the inactivated state. Our study reveals a novel inactivation mechanism in which intercalated lipids physically decouple the tension-sensing helices from the gate.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

We employ sliding window analysis and Pearson correlation to measure functional connectivity states over time. Then, we use Mapper, a topological data analysis tool, to obtain a graphical representation that captures the dynamical transitions of the brain across states; this representation enables the anchoring of the topological characteristics of the combinatorial object with the measured suspense. Our analysis revealed changes in functional connectivity within and between the salience, fronto-parietal, and default networks associated with suspense. In particular, the functional connectivity between the salience and fronto-parietal networks increased with the level of suspense. In contrast, the connections of both networks with the default network decreased. Together, our findings reveal specific dynamical changes in functional connectivity at the network level associated with variation in suspense, and suggest topological data analysis as a potentially powerful tool for studying dynamic brain networks.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

While targeting PVI-mediated gamma oscillations holds great therapeutic promise, their nature and specific functions, e.g., for regulating PFC-to-MD communication, remain elusive.

Fifty-seven participants performed an n-back task while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. The analysis of both components of the EEG spectrum during task performance indicates that both periodic and aperiodic activities exhibit distinct task-related spatiotemporal dynamics that are closely related to cognitive demands. The results suggest that a substantial portion of the changes often attributed to theta oscillations in working memory tasks may be influenced by shifts in the spectral slope of aperiodic activity. This finding indicates that the modulation of aperiodic activity, associated with cognitive control processes, could provide a more sensitive index of cognitive state changes than previously recognised. To further confirm our findings, we also used these analysis methods in an item-recognition task, which showed similar patterns of periodic and aperiodic activity. These observations challenge the conventional understanding of low-frequency oscillations in cognitive processing and raise concerns about the routine practice of EEG baseline correction in time-frequency analysis, as it may obscure significant modulations in continuous working memory tasks.

It is not yet clear whether these state fluctuations differently impact the distributed neural processes that underlie task performance, from sensory processing to control of motor outputs. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is an association-level cortical region implicated in sensorimotor transformations, but evidence of its causal requirement in decision-making tasks has been contradictory. We trained mice to perform a navigation-based sound localization task and asked how natural fluctuations in behavioral state related to neural processing in association areas during decision-making. Behavioral performance in expert-level mice was not static but instead transitioned between periods of near-perfect performance and biased, less accurate performance. Using a hidden Markov model, we could reliably define these as distinct strategies that included a high-performance state where mice used relevant stimulus information to inform choices, and two biased states where mice weighted stimulus information less strongly. Optogenetic inactivation of PPC decreased task performance accuracy, and the model captured the resulting change in behavioral strategy as a reduction in the weighting of the auditory cues and an increase in behavioral bias, in predicting mices decisions. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed that performance states strongly influenced population activity patterns in PPC, but not primary auditory cortex (AC). Surprisingly, activity of individual PPC neurons was better explained by external inputs and behavioral variables during biased behavioral performance, while shared variability across neurons in PPC was strongest in the high-performance state.

Detailed biophysical models with active dendrites have been instrumental in exploring this interaction. However, such models can be challenging to understand and validate due to the large number of parameters involved. In this work, we introduce DendroTweaks, a toolbox designed to make detailed biophysical models with active dendrites more intuitive and more interactive. DendroTweaks features a web-based graphical interface, where users can explore single-cell neuronal models and adjust their morphological and biophysical parameters with real-time visual feedback. In particular, DendroTweaks focuses on subcellular properties, such as kinetics and distribution of ion channels, as well as the dynamics and placement of synaptic inputs. The toolbox supports various experimental protocols designed to illuminate how morpho-electric properties map to dendritic events and how these dendritic events shape neuronal output, thereby enhancing model validation. It helps users build high-level, modular model representations and includes a rich set of tools for parsing, generating, and standardizing commonly used neuronal data formats. Finally, it enables model simplification through a built-in morphology reduction algorithm, allowing users to export models for further use in faster, more interpretable networks. By combining extensive visualization capabilities and comprehensive data management functionality, DendroTweaks introduces a novel interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics. This approach will accelerate research on dendritic computations, their underlying mechanisms, and their fundamental role in brain function.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Recent studies demonstrated that zinc is ejected to the extracellular milieu, the 'zinc spark', and follows the first few calcium rises of fertilization. However, the role of the zinc sparks in fertilization and development, and the supporting influx mechanism(s) are unknown. In this study, we focused on zinc transporters Zip10/Slc39a10 which was expressed in mouse oocytes through follicular development, and investigated the oocyte-specific deficient mice for Zip10 (Zip10d/d: Zip10flox/flox Gdf9Cre/+). Zip10 mRNA or ZIP10 protein was expressed throughout folliculogenesis in the oocyte or plasma membrane, respectively. The number of ovulated oocytes was examined in Zip10d/d mice, and no change from the number of oocytes was observed. Zip10d/d oocytes decreased zinc level in the oocytes, but did not affect maturation and metaphase II spindles formation. Fertilization-induced calcium oscillations were present in Zip10d/d oocytes, but zinc sparks were not observed. Despite other events of egg activation proceeding normally in Zip10d/d oocytes, embryo development into 4-cells and beyond was compromised. We show here for the first time that the zinc transporter ZIP10 contributes to zinc homeostasis in oocytes and embryos, highlighting the role of labile zinc ions in early development.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

To identify molecular modulators of Tau toxicity, we used a genetic screen to identify protein chaperones whose RNAi-mediated knockdown could modulate hTauV337M-induced eye-ommatidial degeneration in Drosophila. This screen identified the Prefoldins Pfdn5 and Pfdn6 as strong modifiers of hTauV337M cytotoxicity. Consistent with the known function of Pfdn as a cotranslational chaperone for tubulin, Pfdn5 mutants showed substantially reduced levels of tubulin monomer. However, additional microtubule-related functions were indicated by the robust unexpected association of Pfdn5 with axonal microtubules in vivo, as well as binding with stabilized microtubules in biochemical assays. Loss of Pfdn5 resulted in neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) defects similar to those previously described in hTau-expressing flies: namely, increased supernumerary boutons and fewer microtubule loops within mature presynaptic boutons. Significantly, synaptic phenotypes caused by hTauV337M overexpression were also strongly enhanced in a Pfdn5 mutant background. Consistent with a role in modulating Tau toxicity, not only did loss of Pfdn5 result in increased accumulations of Tau-aggregates in hTauV337M expressing neurons, but also neuronal overexpression of Prefoldin strikingly ameliorated age-dependent neurodegeneration and memory deficits induced by pathological hTau. Together, these and other observations described herein: (a) provide new insight into Prefoldin-microtubule interactions; (b) point to essential posttranslational roles for Pfdn5 in controlling Tau-toxicity in vivo; and (c) demonstrate that Pfdn5 overexpression is sufficient to restrict Tau-induced neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Using widefield calcium imaging, we discovered that the envelope steepness is represented orthogonally to the tonotopic axis, forming a two-dimensional cortical map that mirrors the dual structure of sounds. This organization was observed in primary-like auditory regions but not in higher-order-like areas, indicating distinct auditory processing streams.

During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium dependent lifetime change of >1 nanosecond. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria.

These mechanisms are investigated theoretically and by simulations of balance control, both free standing and while riding a bicycle. I demonstrate that compensating for a SMD requires a convolution predictor, which involves a convolution over a memory buffer of efference copies and an initial condition obtained from a state observer that is based on a delayed-input forward model. The performance of a convolution predictor does not crucially depend on its exact computational implementation because a similar performance is obtained with an approximate convolution using a boxcar kernel.

However, the role microglia play in the development of AUD-related neuronal and behavioral pathology is unclear. Given the ability of microglia to regulate neuronal function, it was hypothesized that proinflammatory microglia promote neuronal death and hyperkatifeia during prolonged abstinence from binge alcohol. Proinflammatory signaling and affective state were assessed in mice either during acute withdrawal (24h) or abstinence (>4 weeks) to binge alcohol exposure. Ten days of binge alcohol increased proinflammatory gene signaling 24h after EtOH, which lasted weeks into withdrawal. Alcohol reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hyperkatifeia-associated regions (i.e., the central amygdala and infralimbic cortex) during acute withdrawal and caused persistent microglial structural changes and loss of microglial BDNF in the BNST during abstinence. This was associated with increased anxiety-like behavior and hyperarousal, with persistent enhancement of conditioned fear memory during abstinence. Inhibition of proinflammatory microglia with Gi designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) blocked neuronal death and prevented persistent proinflammatory gene induction and hyperkatifeia in female mice. Thus, this identifies a direct role for microglia in the development of AUD-related neuropathology and behavioral dysfunction, implicating microglia as cellular targets for the prevention of AUD phenotypes.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Here we address this question by developing a dynamic latent state model, which we applied to training data from mice learning to perform a visual decision-making task. Remarkably, we found that mice exhibited distinct \"engaged\" and \"biased\" states even during early training, with multiple states apparent from the second training session onward. Moreover, our model revealed that the gradual improvement in task performance over the course of training arose from a combination of two factors: (1) increased sensitivity to stimuli across all states; and (2) increased proportion of time spent in a higher-accuracy \"engaged\" state relative to biased states. These findings highlight the power of our approach for characterizing the temporal evolution of multiple strategies across learning.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Our previous study reported that shoot nitrate accumulation increases shoot expression of adenosine phosphate-ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE 3 (IPT3) and shoot levels of N6-({Delta}2-isopentenyl) adenine (iP)-type cytokinins (CKs). IPT3 expression is localized in the phloem, and iP-type CKs, which are synthesized by IPT3, are phloem-mobile. As CKs are a class of phytohormones that control growth and genome-wide gene expression, shoot-expressed IPT3 may mediate the systemic regulation of growth and transcriptomic responses to shoot nitrate status. To examine this, we developed a novel system to manipulate nitrate levels and IPT3 expression in a shoot-specific manner and performed growth analysis, CK determination, and RNA-sequencing. Our results demonstrated that shoot nitrate accumulation significantly promoted shoot growth and elevated shoot concentrations of iP ribotides, iP-7-N-glucoside, and iP-9-N-glucoside through the action of shoot IPT3. Transcriptomic responses to shoot nitrate accumulation were largely tuned by shoot IPT3, with opposite effects in shoots and roots. Shoot IPT3 amplified shoot responses of nitrate-inducible genes and immune response genes to shoot nitrate accumulation, while dampened root responses of nitrate transport/assimilation genes. This transcriptomic modulation via shoot IPT3 was accompanied by coherent transcriptional changes in genes encoding mobile peptides and transcriptional repressors.

By integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and comparative genomics, we constructed a single-cell atlas of P. australis and identified 19 transcriptionally distinct cell types, including shoot apical meristem, epidermal, and vascular tissues. Comparative analysis of common garden-grown native (European) and invasive (North American) populations revealed a significant proportion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) located on B chromosomes, which underwent copy number expansion in invasive genomes. The proportion of B chromosome genes in DEGs varies across cell types, with the highest proportions observed in the epidermis and mesophyll, and lower proportions in the vascular tissues.

Both compounds have shown antiseizure, sedative, and antioxidant effects in rodent and in vitro models. Due to their structural similarity, a comparative evaluation of their antiseizure profiles is warranted. This study examined the effects of acute LIN and NER exposure in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure model in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Methods: A total of 240 adult zebrafish were randomly assigned to the following groups: blank control (dechlorinated water), vehicle control (1% DMSO), positive control (50 M diazepam, DZP), and three concentrations of LIN or NER (4, 40, 400 M). Fish were exposed to treatments for 10 minutes, transferred to a washout beaker with dechlorinated water for 5 minutes, and then transferred to PTZ (10 mM) for 20-minute behavioral recording. Seizure activity was scored by blinded observers (BORIS(R)), and locomotion was analyzed with ANY-maze software. Results: LIN at 400 M and NER at 40 and 400 M significantly prolonged latency to clonic- and tonic-like seizures and reduced seizure severity. Notably, 400 M NER exceeded DZP in effect size, and 40 M NER also enhanced locomotor activity.

Seed longevity in storage is determined by the initial seed viability and the rate of seed viability loss. The rate of seed viability loss in storage varies between species, and there is possibly also some variation between populations or even genotypes within species. However, the extent of this intraspecific variability and its drivers remain unclear. Methods: We investigated both inter- and intraspecific variability in seed longevity and its predictors in 41 common grassland species and 188 seed accessions from across Europe. We exposed the seeds to artificial ageing conditions (60% RH, 45 C) and used probit analysis to obtain the rate of seed viability loss (sigma) as a measure of seed longevity. We then related {sigma} to both accession- and species-specific factors. Key results: Seed longevity (sigma) varied significantly among accessions within 58% of the species, and the probability of detecting such intraspecific differences increased with the number of accessions available for a given species. This suggests that within-species variation in seed longevity is widespread. Accession-specific predictors explained only 14.4% of the within-species variability. Specifically, seed longevity increased with the mean annual temperature at the accession origin and decreased with the accession-specific seed weight. Across species, seed longevity differed among plant families but was unrelated to seed weight or seed chemical composition. Conclusions.

The various hypotheses include growth from cameral fluids, precipitation by a cameral mantle or even their dismissal as post-mortem structures. All of these previous interpretations have in common that they are complicated with contradictory evidence. Here, we present evidence from well-preserved Trematoceras elegans specimens from the Late Triassic St. Cassian Formation (Dolomites, northern Italy). We studied the specimens by using optical and electron beam microanalysis techniques and argue that the cameral deposits consist of primary aragonite and calcite fabrics. A fibrous microstructure, which is bilaterally symmetrically arranged with irregularities, is documented. Thin organic sheets originally delimited radial growth sectors. Based on these observations, we propose a new growth model that explicitly involves the cameral sheets. These sheets acted as an extension of the pellicle and held a thin film of supersaturated liquid in the otherwise emptied chambers by the cameral sheets via the capillary effect. Ions were supplied through the siphuncle, such as in living Nautilus, and enabled the precipitation of aragonite and calcite fabrics.

Such constancies would imply that V1 is composed of multiple identical units whose visual properties diff er only due to diff erences in their inputs. To test this, we used fMRI to investigate how V1 cortical magnifi cation and preferred spatial frequency covary with eccentricity and polar angle, measured in 40 observers. V1 cortical magnifi cation and preferred spatial frequency were strongly correlated across eccentricity and around polar angle, however their relation diff ered between these dimensions: they were proportional across eccentricity but not polar angle. The constant ratio of cortical magnifi cation to preferred spatial frequency when measured as a function of eccentricity suggests a shared underlying cause of variation in the two properties, e.g., the gradient of retinal ganglion cell density across eccentricity.

In omics studies, RDA provides a flexible framework for investigating associations between high-dimensional molecular data. However, omics datasets often exhibit strong multicollinearity and suffer from the \"large p, small n\" problem, where the number of predictor variables p (features) exceeds the number of samples n. Ridge RDA addresses multicollinearity by introducing a ridge penalty in addition to the rank restriction. Despite these advantages, its application to high-dimensional omics data remains challenging due to i) difficulties in manipulating the large coefficient matrix of dimensions p x q, where q represents the number of response variables, and ii) the need to jointly select the rank and the regularization parameter that both influence the performance of the method. Results: We propose an efficient computational framework for ridge RDA that overcomes these challenges by leveraging the Singular Value Decomposition of the predictor matrix X. This approach eliminates the need for direct covariance matrix inversion, improving computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy that reduces the memory burden associated with the storage of the coefficient matrix from pq to (p+q)r, with r the chosen reduced-rank dimensionality. Our method enables an efficient grid search to jointly select the ridge penalty {lambda} and r via cross-validation. The proposed framework is implemented in the R package rrda, providing a practical and scalable solution for the analysis of high-dimensional omics data.

By integrating transcriptomic (microarray data and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing [sn-RNA] data), molecular imaging, and neuroimaging datasets, we present converging evidence that the spatial distribution of diverse cell types, neurotransmitter systems, and mitochondrial phenotypes are systematically aligned with intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs)-the macroscale scaffolding of brain function. These associations extend beyond local correspondence to reflect network-level structure: inter-ICN similarity networks derived from cellular and molecular profiles significantly recapitulate both static and dynamic patterns of functional network connectivity (FNC), mirroring the established division of ICNs into canonical functional domains. Importantly, these cellular and molecular profiles not only co-localize with ICNs and FNC but also appear to support their role as intermediaries linking microscale biological substrates to cognitive function. Mediation analyses reveal that specific ICNs statistically mediate the relationship between microscale cell-type architecture and domain-specific cognitive and behavioral processes. Moreover, dynamic FNC, particularly in specific transient states, captures the mediating pathways linking cell-type and neurotransmitter similarity networks to cognitive network organization. Taken together, our findings suggest that the brain's functional architecture is systematically aligned with cellular and molecular organization, which may act as a biological constraint guiding functional network formation and shaping the neural basis of cognition.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Their role in dengue remains unexplored. In this study, circEPSTI1 induction was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma of dengue patients. The induction of circEPSTI1 is interferon-dependent and enhances DENV infection by sponging the expression of miR-942-5p. The antiviral role of miR-942-5p is mediated by bidirectional inhibition through targeting conserved genomic sequences of the DENV genome of different subtypes across NS1, NS3, and NS5 and the host AKT1 signaling pathway. RNA-seq analysis of DENV-infected circEPSTI1 knockdown A549 cells identified SERPINE1 and AKT1 signaling pathways to be dysregulated significantly. circEPSTI1 relieves the inhibition of miR-942-5p over DENV genomic RNA and the host SERPINE1 to activate AKT1 signaling. The activation of AKT1 signaling facilitates cell survival and enhances DENV replication. The expression of SERPINE1 and circEPSTI1 was upregulated in Dengue patients, and pharmaceutical inhibition of SERPINE1 through Tiplaxtinin inhibits the DENV replication by reducing the expression of circEPSTI1.

However, technical tools that analyse the predictive behaviour at the genome level are lacking. Here, we develop a computational tool called Ensemble AnalySis with Interpretable Genomic Prediction (EasiGP) that uses circos plots to visualise how different genomic prediction models quantify contributions of marker effects to trait phenotypes. As a demonstration of EasiGP, multiple genomic prediction models, spanning conventional statistical and machine learning algorithms, were used to infer the genetic architecture of days to anthesis (DTA) in a maize mapping population. The results indicate that genomic prediction models can capture different views of trait genetic architecture, even when their overall profiles of prediction accuracy are similar. Combinations of diverse views of the genetic architecture for the DTA trait in the TeoNAM study might explain the improved prediction performance achieved by ensembles, aligned with the implication of the Diversity Prediction Theorem. In addition to identifying well-known genomic regions contributing to the genetic architecture of DTA in maize, the ensemble of genomic prediction models highlighted several new genomic regions that have not been previously reported for DTA. Finally, different views of trait genetic architecture were observed across sub-populations, highlighting challenges for between-population genomic prediction.

During disease progression astrocytes exhibit morphologic and metabolic shifts; however, the specific impact of glaucoma-related biomechanical strains on astrocyte behavior remains poorly understood. To address this, we used our previously established 3D cell-encapsulated extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel to investigate ONH astrocyte cellular and transcriptomic responses to varying biomechanical strain levels over time. Murine ONH astrocyte were encapsulated within an ECM hydrogel made from photocrosslinkable collagen type I and hyaluronic acid, and subjected to 0, 3, or 10% cyclic compression for 4h and 24h. We found significant restructuring of cytoskeletal morphology, metabolic dysregulation, and astrocyte-mediated ECM modulation that were strain-, duration- and hydrogel subregion-dependent. These phenotypic alterations were associated with diverse transcriptional changes in genes related to cell cycle and morphology, inflammation, metabolism and matrix remodeling that were driven by compressive strain intensity and duration. Our work reveals the direct role of compressive strain in eliciting a complex astrocyte response, supports targeting mechanosensation to prevent these pathologic astrocyte responses, and establishes ECM-based hydrogels as a platform to test mechanisms driving astrocyte mechanodysfunction.

However, optimization of microfluidics-integrated biosensor systems and replicability challenges present roadblocks in validation and commercialization. Understanding factors contributing to yield and replicability in biosensor performance is key to the development of biosensor optimization frameworks and technology translation beyond the research setting. Hence, for the first time, we present a detailed analysis of factors affecting performance, assay yield, and intra- and inter-assay replicability in microfluidics-integrated silicon photonic (SiP) evanescent-field microring resonator biosensors. Strategies for mitigating bubbles--a major operational hurdle and contributor to instability and variability in microfluidics-integrated biosensors--are analyzed to improve assay yield. Effective bubble mitigation is demonstrated by combining microfluidic device degassing, plasma treatment, and microchannel pre-wetting with surfactant solution. Both intrinsic and analyte-detection performance metrics and their replicability are quantified for the first time for sub-wavelength grating-based SiP biosensors, highlighting a path to further optimization. Lastly, the effects of sensor functionalization on analyte detection performance and replicability are evaluated. We compare polydopamine- vs. Protein A-mediated bioreceptor immobilization chemistries and spotting- vs. flow-mediated bioreceptor patterning approaches. We find that simple polydopamine-mediated, spotting-based functionalization improves spike protein (1 g/mL) detection signal by 8.2x and 5.8x compared to polydopamine/flow and Protein A/flow approaches, respectively, and yields an inter-assay coefficient of variability below the standard 20% threshold for immunoassay validation.

T.; Adams, J.; Richards, Z.; Campbell, K.", "abstract": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are essential for morphogenesis, converting static epithelial cells into migratory mesenchymal cells. As EMT disrupts epithelial barriers, its timing must be tightly regulated during development. We investigated this regulation in the Drosophila posterior embryonic midgut, where the GATA transcription factor Serpent (Srp) drives a collective partial EMT in the principal midgut epithelial cells (PMECs). Srp is expressed well before PMEC-EMT initiation and is also required for an earlier event: the specification and delamination of endoblasts, which give rise to different midgut lineages including adult midgut progenitors (AMPs). Here we identify the steroid hormone ecdysone as a temporal cue that triggers PMEC-EMT. Although Srp activates and represses numerous genes during early stages of midgut development, including polarity regulators such as crumbs (crb), the removal of polarity proteins and E-Cadherin from the membrane of PMECs only properly occurs in the presence of ecdysone signalling. This suggests that Srp primes cells transcriptionally for EMT, which proceeds only once polarity and adhesion proteins are downregulated post-translationally. When PMECs undergo a premature EMT, this leads to a reduction in the number of progenitor cells, suggesting that maintaining epithelial integrity until after endoblasts are selected is crucial for early fate decisions. These findings reveal that ecdysone functions as a EMT gatekeeper, ensuring that EMT is temporally restricted to occur only after progenitor specification, and in coordination with other developmental processes. More broadly, our work shows that in this context, transcriptional priming of EMT can be uncoupled from its execution, which is post-translationally triggered by hormonal signals. Given the conserved role of nuclear steroid hormone receptors as GATA co-factors and their association with poor prognosis in cancer, this may represent a broader strategy by which systemic cues regulate EMT in development and cancer.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Morphometric, biochemical, histological, metabolic, and oxidative parameters were assessed. Rats fed the B/SP diet exhibited greater body weight and adiposity despite similar caloric intake, yet these changes were largely compensatory, with enhanced fat mobilization, redistribution toward subcutaneous depots, and improved antioxidant defenses.

However, only a minority of infected individuals progress to malignancy, influenced by a mix of bacterial, host, and environmental factors. Current predictive approaches are limited due to relying mainly on clinical and lifestyle data. Genomic approaches have been sparsely used, and thus their incorporation into machine learning models could ensure early and personalized detection. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of integrating host metadata with genomic features from H. pylori to predict gastric cancer outcomes and identify associated variables. Methods: 1,363 publicly available H. pylori genomes with associated host information between 1991 and 2024 were collected from NCBI and EnteroBase. Demographic features, virulence genes, sequence-derived and variant-based features were extracted. Machine learning models were then developed to classify infection outcomes into gastric cancer and non-gastric cancer. Logistic regression, an interpretable baseline model, was compared against higher-performance ensemble models (XGBoost, Random Forest). Model performance was assessed using recall, precision, AUROC, and AUPRC curves. Results: The logistic regression model achieved a recall of 0.736 (95% CI: 0.644-0.831) for gastric cancer and an AUROC of 0.888 (95% CI: 0.843-0.929). Both XGBoost and Random Forest models outperformed the baseline model with AUROC values ranging from 0.950-0.954 (95% CI: 0.904-0.976). Black-box model recall for gastric cancer detection improved compared to the baseline by 8.3% for XGBoost (0.797, 95% CI: 0.711-0.877), and 11.4% for Random Forest (0.820, 95% CI: 0.734-0.896). Across models, patient age consistently emerged as the strongest predictor of gastric cancer, with several sequence-derived genomic features beyond pre-established virulence genes contributing to the infection outcome differences. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that combining pathogen genomics with host demographics uncovers novel risk factors and ensures early detection with high predictive power. The use of explainability methods like SHAP allows for greater interpretability by clinical professionals and improves informed decision-making processes.

However, owing to the complexities of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and brain biology, understanding how the implicated genes coalesce into neurobiological pathways remains elusive, with few robust mechanistic insights to date. Here, we use single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from neurons from across the human brain to identify gene co-expression networks, then weight them by polygenic heritability to implicate more-specific biology in neuropsychiatric disorders. Using this framework, we highlight the dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis as an etiological driver of neuropsychiatric disorders. Further supporting these results, we find that a critical component of this molecular system, the P-type calcium ATPase ATP2B2, exhibits marked expression deficits in both nuclear transcriptomic and synaptic proteomic datasets derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of individuals with schizophrenia. We then developed a method that uses missense variants in case-control cohorts together with protein structures (inferred from AlphaFold3) to systematically prioritize mutational hotspots of biological significance for downstream mechanistic interrogation. This approach identified an enrichment of deleterious missense variants - implicated across multiple neuropsychiatric disorders - that changed protein residues in close spatial proximity to both the Ca2+ permeation tunnel and the ATP:Mg2+ coordination site of ATP2B2. Cellular and biochemical analyses of variants in both the ATP:Mg2+ coordination site and the canonical Ca2+ binding site revealed clear loss-of-function effects, establishing two distinct molecular mechanisms that converge on impaired calcium extrusion, likely perturbing pre- and post-synaptic Ca2+ homeostatic equilibrium.

Together, these findings identify interferon signaling as a modifiable and sex-linked driver of AD pathology. Our study uncovers a critical neuroimmune mechanism contributing to female-biased vulnerability and highlights interferon modulation as a promising therapeutic strategy in AD.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

To increase the longevity of such products, formulations are usually developed with small molecule additives known as excipients. Incorporating excipients is a costly and time-consuming process due to the large excipient design space and unknown mechanisms underlying excipient-virus interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations are, in theory, well-equipped to efficiently investigate these mechanisms. However, the massive size of fully assembled viral capsids---the protein shell that encapsulates the viral genome---demands computational resources well beyond the requirements of conventional simulations. There exists a need for a novel method that enables high-throughput investigations of virus-excipient interactions at the molecular level. Here, we introduce CapSACIN --- a computational framework for Capsid Surface Abstraction and Computationally-Induced Nanofragmentation. We demonstrate the applicability of this workflow to a model non-enveloped virus, porcine parvovirus (PPV). Through simulations of PPV surface models, we observe that the 2-fold axis of symmetry is significantly weaker at a molecular level than the 3- or 5-fold axes of symmetry.

While bone has an innate self-healing capacity, this process can be disrupted in cases of large or complex defects, where regeneration fails, and clinical intervention is required. This study aimed at the development of a tissue engineering approach using human periosteum-derived cell (hPDC) spheroids encapsulated or bioprinted at high density within hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA) hydrogels to support hypertrophic cartilage formation as a template for endochondral bone regeneration. We first compared different encapsulation time points (days 1, 7, and 14), finding that early encapsulation (day 1) enhanced spheroid fusion, increased DNA content, and promoted hypertrophic cartilage formation, as indicated by greater glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen deposition along with lacunae formation. Next, HAMA-encapsulated spheroids were compared to spheroids formed using a standardized microwell platform, demonstrating that encapsulation promoted a more mature cartilage-like matrix with thicker collagen fibers and enhanced hypertrophic differentiation. Gene expression and immunostaining confirmed progression toward hypertrophic and osteogenic phenotypes. Finally, extrusion-based bioprinting of HAMA bioinks comprising a high-density of hPDC spheroids demonstrated scalability, improved spheroid alignment, and maintained robust cell viability and hypertrophic differentiation.

O.; Hawkins, I.; Noordermeer, I.; Rodriguez, M. M.; Stanton, L. A.; Goheen, J. R.; Alston, J.

In human-occupied areas, prolonged habituation to human activity could therefore lead to relaxed antipredator behavior by prey species, which can be detrimental when predators return or if individuals are translocated to new areas that host predators. We conducted behavioral trials to test whether exposure of Guenther's dik-dik (Madoqua guentheri) to human activity affected habituation to humans and, by extension, response to predation cues. We hypothesized that dik-diks living in areas with higher levels of human activity would exhibit shorter flight initiation distances and spend less time responding to predation cues than those in areas with less human activity, but would respond more strongly to non-specific predation cues (i.e., alarm calls from white-browed sparrow-weavers, a locally common bird) than to cues associated with predators that avoid human activity (i.e., hyena vocalizations). Flight initiation distance and responses to both sparrow-weaver alarm calls and hyena vocalizations varied predictably with differences in human activity: dik-diks living in areas with more human activity had shorter flight initiation distances and spent less time responding to predation cues than those living in areas with less human activity, but responded more strongly to the sparrow-weaver alarm calls than hyena vocalizations in the area with the highest level of human activity. As human populations expand and overlap increasingly with predators, human settlements and activities may increase susceptibility of prey to predators by increasing prey naivety to predators that avoid humans. These results are particularly relevant for ecotourism in working landscapes and translocation of habituated animals, both of which may increase prey naivety.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

High-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) signals offering rich information, particularly suited to DNN-based algorithms, were collected from thirteen participants performing wrist movements. Three types of synthetic disturbances were introduced: additive white Gaussian noise (WGN), channel loss, and electrode shift. Results indicate that when using amplitude-based features (specifically, the root mean square value and the mean absolute value), the estimator maintains robust performance under increasing WGN and channel loss, whereas its performance deteriorates markedly with features reflecting signal dynamics and fluctuations, like slope sign changes and zero crossings. Under electrode shift conditions, employing a combined feature set enhances the classifier's resilience.

Conditional deletion of Otp in two-month-old mice resulted in impaired stress responses, characterized by increased depressive-like behavior and elevated stress-induced cortisol levels. It also led to various metabolic changes, including reduced thyroid hormone levels and body temperature, a higher percentage of fat mass, and diminished responsiveness to ghrelin without affecting food intake, energy expenditure, or body weight.

If the object's trajectory can be predicted, humans can shift gaze to the anticipated object's future location. For instance, when hitting a moving ball, people predictively look at the ball's bouncing location, allowing them to overcome sensorimotor delays that would otherwise limit visual information uptake from that position. Such delays become pronounced with healthy aging, which might drive a behavioral shift towards stronger reliance on predictive gaze allocation to future positions of interest during visuomotor tasks. To investigate this, we examined gaze and hand movements of older and younger adults who played an iPad-based version of the game 'Pong' against an automated opponent. Participants moved a paddle of two different sizes with their finger to intercept a ball moving in two speeds and bouncing off the side walls. We hypothesized that aging would lead to earlier gaze shifts to positions of interest, such as to the final wall bounce location before the ball moved toward the participants' paddle, and to their own paddle around the moment of interception. As expected, both age groups intercepted fewer balls when using smaller paddles. Contrary to our hypothesis, older participants looked later than younger adults to the final wall bounce. However, they shifted their gaze earlier to their own paddle before interception, especially at the beginning of the experiment. This suggests that aging enhances predictive gaze shifts related to the immediate action. While gaze allocation patterns largely overlap between older and younger adults, aging specifically leads to adaptive eye movements just before interacting with the environment.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

While methods such as caffeine are widely accepted, others, including prescription stimulants and non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS), evoke ethical concern. This study examined how university students evaluate three forms of cognitive enhancement (natural, pharmacological, brain stimulation) across five moral domains: academic fairness, free will, naturalness, self-identity, and safety. We also tested how evaluations were shaped by framing (preservation vs. enhancement) and priming (self-affecting vs. non-self-affecting). A total of 449 students completed an online experiment with a 2 by 2 by 3 mixed design, rating enhancement acceptability after reading intervention-specific scenarios. Natural enhancers were judged most positively, followed by brain stimulation and then pharmacological agents. Importantly, although brain stimulation is legal and marketed as non-invasive, it was evaluated more like pharmacological enhancement than natural methods, indicating that legality does not equate to moral acceptability. Framing effects showed that participants were more accepting of enhancement when it was described as preserving ability rather than augmenting it beyond baseline. Priming participants to consider how others use might affect their own outcomes reduced moral acceptability, particularly for pharmacological and brain stimulation methods in the domain of academic fairness. Overall, public attitudes toward enhancement appeared shaped less by legality or objective safety than by intuitive moral reasoning. These findings highlight the importance of adopting pluralistic, context-sensitive approaches to policy and regulation, as student judgments reflect concerns about fairness, authenticity, and competition in academic life.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

While much is known about the wound microbiome, our knowledge of the metabolic landscape and its influence on microbial diversity and wound healing is limited. Furthermore, the integration of these complex datasets into a predictive model with relevance to clinical outcome is almost non-existent. Here, we present a multiomics data analysis coupled with machine-learning cross validation of microbiome and metabolome profiles from human chronic wounds. The model was integrated with patient metadata to determine predictive correlation to clinical outcome under standard of care. Methods: Microbial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and total metabolites were extracted from 45 DFU debridement samples collected from 13 patients at the Boise VA Medical Center. Of 45 samples analyzed, 25 samples were isolated from wounds that failed to respond to standard treatment while the remaining 20 samples were taken from wounds that progressed to healing and remained closed for >30 days. 16S rRNA sequencing and global metabolomics were performed and clinical metadata was collected from patient records. Healing outcome was modeled as a function of three blocks of features (N = 21 clinical, 634 microbiome, and 865 metabolome) using DIABLO (Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker Discovery using Latent Components) based on multiblock sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) which performs feature selection using LASSO regularization.

We illustrate how cortical and subcortical inter-individual variability of receptor and transporter density varies across brain regions and across neurotransmitter systems. We complement inter-individual variability with inter-regional variability, and show that receptors that vary more across brain regions than across individuals also demonstrate greater out-of-sample spatial consistency. Altogether, this work quantifies how receptor systems vary in healthy individuals, and provides a means of assessing the generalizability of PET-derived receptor density quantification.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Yet, the empirical evidence for the dynamic involvement of MSP and TSP in learning remains elusive. We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging to estimate the end points of MSP- and TSP-related white matter structures (i.e., footprints) within hippocampal subfields and entorhinal cortex. We then measured the activation of pathway-specific footprints with functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants learned novel concepts defined by regularities and exceptions. The functional footprint method revealed links between MSP-related footprint activation and regularity encoding early in learning, and TSP-related footprint activation and exception encoding late in learning. These findings provide novel evidence that learning concept regularities and exceptions is distinctly supported by hippocampal pathways. Pathway footprint approach provides insights into the functional dynamics of the human hippocampus, translating theoretical and computational work into empirically testable questions in humans.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

A. M.; Karnani, M. M.; Jackson, J.", "abstract": "The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) sends top-down inputs to the claustrum during sensory, motor, and cognitive processing. This ACC input is thought to drive the activation of claustrum neurons which in turn project back to the cortex to help orchestrate cortical networks during demanding cognitive states such as attention. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying ACC-claustrum signaling are not fully understood. Using in vivo single neuron recordings in mice, we show that ACC neuron activation drives a lateralized modulation of claustrum excitability that changes as a function of postnatal age. In adulthood, ACC activation evoked feed-forward inhibition of ipsilateral excitatory claustrum neurons and activation of contralateral excitatory claustrum neurons. Chemogenetic manipulation in adult mice revealed that ipsilateral claustrum inhibition by the ACC was due to feed-forward activation of claustrum parvalbumin inhibitory neurons. However, in neonatal mice, which lack mature parvalbumin interneurons, ACC inputs evoked claustrum excitation. In juvenile mice, the developmental switch from ACC-evoked claustrum excitation to inhibition occurred in parallel with the maturation of claustrum parvalbumin interneurons, thus corroborating the chemogenetic findings. Therefore, this work provides a novel mechanism of cortical control over claustrum activity that is refined during early postnatal life.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

D.; Sannamath, S.; Kumar, N.", "abstract": "Learning multiple motor skills without interference and expressing the correct one in a changing environment is a fundamental challenge. Contextual cues are known to help separate these memories, but how they interact during retrieval is not well understood. We investigated how the stability, recency, and transitional statistics of learning environments influence this process. Across six visuomotor adaptation experiments, participants learned opposing rotations (Tasks A and B) tagged with distinct contextual cues under different schedules (blocked or interleaved) and were tested in stable or dynamic environments. We found that while contextual cues can successfully separate memories, expression is systematically biased by learned transition statistics: towards more stable memories after imbalanced training, and towards more recent memories when stabilities are matched. Critically, when the stable statistics of training mismatched the volatile statistics of testing, cue-based retrieval collapsed, and behavior was dominated by these stability or recency biases. Conversely, learning in a high-entropy, interleaved environment enabled precise, cue-appropriate expression regardless of the testing schedule. These results demonstrate that memory retrieval is not cue-driven but arises from an arbitration process between cues and transition priors. Our findings reveal that memory retrieval involves weighting sensory information against latent priors derived from the history of context transitions. This work provides a unifying theoretical framework for understanding adaptive memory expression, positing that the brain leverages the learned statistical structure of the environment to infer which memory to recall, thereby balancing cue-driven selection with the stability and predictability of past experience. This principle offers a unifying explanation for interference, spontaneous recovery, and the benefits of variable practice, providing a more holistic model of adaptive motor behavior.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Territorial animals must moderate their social aggression and avoidance behaviors in a manner that maximizes their access to resources and fitness. The ventrolateral division of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMHvl) has been shown to control both social aggression and avoidance in mice, and emerging data show that neural plasticity within VMHvl can drive the experience-dependent adaptation of these behaviors. Here, we investigated the contribution of immediate early gene (IEG) function in supporting this plasticity. In initial experiments, we found that downregulation of the IEG cFos in VMHvl did not significantly moderate the long-term increase in social avoidance seen following an experience of social defeat. However, local knockout of the IEG master regulator Serum Response Factor (SRF, Srf) was able to blunt the impact of social defeat on social avoidance and prevented the effect of social defeat on local optogenetic-evoked social avoidance behavior, demonstrating a critical role for subcortical IEG activity in social defeat-induced behavioral plasticity. To test whether NMDA receptor dependent plasticity might be involved in this effect, we locally infused the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 into VMHvl and assessed the impact of social defeat. Unexpectedly, MK-801 treatment led to an increase in social defeat-induced avoidance, pointing to the existence of opposing IEG and NMDA receptor-dependent adaptive mechanisms in medial hypothalamus. These findings suggest that multiple neural plasticity mechanisms are likely to be at play in the hypothalamic nuclei supporting innate behavior adaptation and show how IEG blockade can be used as a genetic tool to systematically map neural plasticity in the brain.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Teneurins are also known as cell adhesion molecules, but how homophilic and heterophilic Teneurin interactions are integrated is unknown. Here, single-particle-cryo-EM data of Ten2 shows that canonical Latrophilin-binding is sterically incompatible with Ten2-dimerisation, making these interactions exclusive. We engineered surface mutations that specifically disrupt Ten2-Ten2 or Ten2-Latrophilin interactions. These are transferrable to Ten4, suggesting conserved binding mechanisms. Proteomics, in-vivo-gene-editing and super-resolution-microscopy show that Ten4 is expressed along RGC fibres and that migrating neurons switch from low-to-high Ten4-expression. Ten4 expression is highest in the cortical plate where Ten4-Ten4 interactions reduce RGC-attachment. In the intermediate zone, Ten4-Latrophilin interactions are required to promote neuron-RGC association.

The proteases ClpXP and ClpCP are crucial for general and targeted proteolysis, which rely on the unfoldases ClpX and ClpC interacting with specific targets. However, the global effect on the proteome especially under infection-relevant stresses is not well-understood. To assess the effect of ClpX deficiency during infection-related processes, mass spectrometry-based global proteome profiles of S. aureus HG001 wild-type, an isogenic {Delta}clpX mutant, and a clpX complemented strain were recorded under control conditions as well as iron and oxygen limitation. The proteomic profiles revealed specific ClpX- and stress-dependent changes. A set of 24 robust stress-independent ClpX modulated proteins was identified and the stress-dependent influences were unraveled by independent component analysis (using the iModulon approach). These analyses revealed a role of ClpX in e.g., cell division, cell envelope homeostasis, the quinone stress response and prophage activation. Moreover, ClpX-dependent stress-specific effects were observed in the {Delta}clpX mutant, e.g. reduced induction of the heme uptake system under iron limitation and a dampened Rex-controlled oxygen limitation response. This revealed in particular that ClpX is central for heme homeostasis in S. aureus. Furthermore, in a Galleria infection model, the S. aureus {Delta}clpX mutant was attenuated compared to the wild-type HG001. This is consistent with a drastically reduced intracellular replication of the {Delta}clpX-mutant in cell culture-based infection experiments, however, high intracellular persistence of the {Delta}clpX mutant was also observed. This highlights the relevance of ClpX for bacterial fitness and virulence. Importance: During infection processes, pathogens cope with host-mediated stressors. In response to those stressors, bacteria adapt their gene expression as well as their proteome profile. In the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, protein homeostasis is mainly controlled by the Clp system. In particular, ClpX is the most conserved Clp unfoldase and is involved in overall regulation of virulence and bacterial fitness. However, the majority of ClpX targets remains elusive in S. aureus. With our proteomics approach and in depth data analysis, we provide a resource for global insight into ClpX-dependent adaptation of S. aureus physiology under infection-relevant conditions. Based on this, we uncover ClpX's role as a central player in the iron and oxygen limitation response. In addition, we demonstrate the importance of ClpX in S. aureus bacterial fitness in infection processes. However, reduced levels of ClpX lead to high intracellular persistence, which questions ClpX's suitability as a therapeutical target.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that LRE mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagic capacity are critical for efficient nutrient uptake and maintenance of their specialized identity, as disruption of either process leads to premature differentiation into adult enterocytes with diminished endolysosomal and metabolic activity. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that neonatal LREs exhibit a distinctive antioxidant signature, which preserves redox balance and safeguards the expression of the transcriptional regulators MAFB and BLIMP1, both central repressors of the neonatal-to-adult metabolic transition. These findings establish the mitochondria lysosome axis as a key determinant of LRE function and neonatal metabolic programming.

While these systems have been studied to investigate how costly forms of help can evolve, there is little theory explaining the considerable variation in helping strategies observed across such societies. Here, we use mathematical models to investigate the evolution of alternative helping strategies. Helpers in our models can allocate effort to immediate, short-term benefits or durable, long-term benefits. We find that allocation depends on the kinship dynamics within the group. Specifically, where helpers are more related to future breeders than current breeders, often because they themselves become the future breeder, our model typically predicts greater allocation to durable help. Conversely, immediate help is favoured when helpers are less related to future breeders than to current breeders. We use our model to explore how demographic features impact kinship dynamics within the group, identify which factors select for immediate versus durable help, and which amplify conflict between breeders and helpers over helping strategies.

Recent studies have revealed molecular mechanisms of how microridiges formation involving actin and actin-regulatory proteins. However, the molecular mechanism that deforms epithelial membranes to create microridge protrusions remain unknown. We have found that one of the I-BAR domain proteins, baiap2l1a, which is known to regulate membrane curvature, is required for microridge morphogenesis. CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown showed that baiap2l1a mutant zebrafish had defects in microridge morphogenesis. Baiap2l1a mutant zebrafish had shorter and wider microridges than WT microridges. Baiap2l1a localized to microridges, and its localization proceeded microridge actin formation. Furthermore, the baiap2l1a I-BAR domain, which binds and curves membranes, was sufficient to localize to microridges in zebrafish skin cells. Structure/function experiments revealed that the I-BAR domain alone could partially rescued microridge length in baiap2l1a mutants. A 39 amino acid deletion in the I-BAR domain, which caused the loss of one -helix according to AlphaFold2 simulations, is sufficient to impair microridge localization and failed to rescue microridge elongation in baiap2l1a mutants. These results suggest that the I-BAR domain is required for baiap2l1a microridge localization and function.

During mitosis, centrosomes are exposed to mechanical forces via the microtubules they nucleate, yet the material properties underlying their response to these forces remain poorly understood. In this study, we systematically probed the mechanical behavior of C. elegans centrosomes, both in vitro and in vivo. Using microtubule perturbations and quantitative live cell imaging, we found that centrosomes become increasingly deformed during mitosis. Centrosome deformation is independent of cortical pulling forces but instead results from microtubule polymerization within the pericentriolar material. This deformation impacts centrosome size: as microtubule number decreases with cell volume in early cleavage divisions, centrosome size scales proportionately. To directly measure centrosome elasticity, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) on isolated centrosomes in vitro and Brillouin light scattering microscopy in developing embryos in vivo. Both approaches revealed that centrosomes progressively soften during mitosis. Theoretical modeling predicts that softening serves to dampen spindle force fluctuations, helping to protect kinetochore-microtubule interactions and safeguarding chromosome segregation. Further, softening may enhance centrosomal microtubule nucleation capacity, facilitating mitotic spindle assembly, particularly in large early embryonic cells. We propose that centrosome softening is a mechanical adaptation for mitosis that couples microtubule number to centrosome size through force-dependent deformation. This optimally balances two mitotic requirements: the need for robust microtubule nucleation and the ability to withstand spindle forces, thereby ensuring accurate cell division.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Upon oligomerization at the plasma membrane, RTKs become activated and initiate major downstream signaling cascades, such as the ERK pathway, which modulates cytoskeletal dynamics through phosphorylation of cytoskeletal regulators, regulation of actin-binding proteins, and transcriptional activation of immediate-early genes involved in cell structure and motility. Light-inducible RTK systems have been developed to achieve spatiotemporal control of RTK clustering and activation for both basic cell biology research and engineered applications, such as controlling cell migration, proliferation, or differentiation. However, these systems are limited by high basal RTK activation, where substantial RTK activation occurs even before induction, leading to unintended ERK activation and downstream effects. Here, we report a chemically inducible RTK system that minimizes basal activation while enabling direct visualization of RTK clustering at the plasma membrane upon induction. Single-cell imaging reveals visible RTK clusters after induction, with total RTK abundance in the clusters correlating with ERK phosphorylation levels. Using this system, we trigger an ERK-dependent, rapid disassembly of the spectrin-based membrane skeleton. In contrast to previous inducible RTK systems, where the membrane skeleton is disrupted even prior to induction due to background activation, our system exhibits disruption exclusively after induction, enabling precise dissection of RTK-mediated signaling events.

We found that inflammatory stimuli reduce UCP2 expression and oxygen consumption rates (OCR), indicating mitochondrial suppression. Conversely, IL-4-activated macrophages displayed higher UCP2 levels and enhanced respiration. Under glucose deprivation, LPS-stimulated macrophages retained mitochondrial activity despite lower UCP2 levels. Pyruvate emerged as a key regulator of UCP2, blocking its mitochondrial entry reduced UCP2 expression. Additionally, hypoxia markedly decreased UCP2 levels in IL-4-activated macrophages, suggesting that hypoxia contributes to UCP2 suppression in pro-inflammatory macrophages. Notably, pro-inflammatory macrophages exhibit reduced reliance on UCP2 due to suppressed mitochondrial respiration. Pyruvate regulates UCP2 expression, highlighting the connection between glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism.

It is therefore critical to develop more effective therapies that improve survival and reduce side effects for these lethal brain cancers. Glioblastoma cells constantly reprogram their metabolism to adapt to changing conditions. As current treatments are not effective, the need for a deeper understanding of metabolic processes and signaling pathways grows critical. Methods: To support this, we have established a collection of human GBM cell cultures derived from freshly resected tumor tissues from 78 patients undergoing surgery at CHU de Quebec, Laval University. We aimed to characterize this cell lines by combining histologic, metabolomic and gene expression analysis. Results: Among the 21 cases that successfully generated cell lines, all were IDH-wildtype (IDH-wt) GBMs, with molecular profiles, including Ki-67 proliferation index, ATRX status, p53 expression, and MGMT promoter methylation. Characterization of five cell lines revealed significant metabolic and phenotypic heterogeneity, with differences in amino acid levels, TCA cycle metabolites, and RNA expression of GBM subtype markers. Our data suggest that mesenchymal-like GBM cells exhibit higher metabolic activity compared to proneural-like cells. Conclusions: Together, the analyses highlight the heterogeneity of GBM cells across patients. These findings emphasize the complexity of GBM and the need for personalized approaches in treatment, taking into account the diverse metabolic and molecular characteristics of GBM cells.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that the microbiota initiates the movement of retinoids--dietary vitamin A derivatives including retinol and retinoic acid--through a sequential pathway from epithelial cells to myeloid cells and ultimately to T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs). This cellular axis is traversed over three days. Microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) initiate retinoid flux by inducing expression of serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins. These epithelial retinol-binding proteins are necessary and sufficient for epithelial-to-myeloid cell retinoid transfer and for myeloid cell migration to the mLNs. In the mLNs, microbial antigen drives retinoid transfer from myeloid cells to developing T cells, culminating in T cell retinoid uptake and transcriptional programming. This pathway is activated during postnatal development, when gut adaptive immunity is first established. These findings reveal that the microbiota programs intestinal adaptive immunity by regulating immune cell access to a nutrient-derived developmental signal.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

We recently showed that H3.3G34R/V substitutions, seen in both cancer and BLBS, impair associations with the DNMT3A DNA methyltransferase. Our proteomic, enzymatic, and structural analyses now show that H3.3 BLBS mutations flanking glycine 34 have surprisingly stark effects on H3K36 methyltransferases, drastically altering H3K36 methyl states in cis and the binding of effector proteins with a PWWP domain, including DNMT3A/B.

A notable example is cluster assistance, whereby a miRNA hairpin with suboptimal nuclear biogenesis can be enhanced by an optimal neighbor. This process involves local transfer of the Microprocessor complex, composed of the RNase III enzyme Drosha and its partner DGCR8, in concert with cofactors such as ERH and SAFB1/2. However, the mechanism(s) that underlie miRNA cluster assistance remain largely unclear. Here, we gain insights into this process by integrating mutant cells of Microprocessor and its cofactors with analysis of miRNA structure-function variants, biochemical tests and genomewide profiling. We define features of suboptimal miRNAs that render them dependent on cluster assistance, and distinguish amongst a network of proposed interactions amongst Microprocessor and its cofactors, to reveal a subset that are critical for cluster assistance. Most importantly, we use epistatic tests to separate and order the functional requirements for ERH and SAFB1/2 into a pathway. Our data indicate that ERH may engage in the process of Microprocessor transfer between hairpins, while SAFB factors (especially SAFB2) mediate recognition and stable binding of a suboptimal miRNA hairpin after Microprocessor transfer. Finally, we show how cluster assistance integrates into a feedback regulatory loop on Microprocessor, via Drosha-mediated cleavage of a suboptimal miRNA hairpin in the DGCR8 transcript. Altogether, our findings reveal complex regulatory transactions during biogenesis of clustered miRNAs.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Cell populations presenting hybrid EMT states at start, when exposed to high CENP-A levels, progressively accumulated mesenchymal states and displayed increased centromeric and ectopic CENP-A incorporation.

Accordingly, cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to restrict L1 retrotransposition. Several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that interact with cytoplasmic L1 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), which contain the L1-encoded proteins ORF1p and ORF2p, have been identified as suppressors of L1 retrotransposition. We previously reported that the ISG protein HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 5 (HERC5) efficiently inhibits L1 retrotransposition. While HERC5 is known to restrict numerous viruses through ISGylation, how HERC5 inhibits L1 remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that HERC5 inhibits L1 retrotransposition through an ISGylation-independent mechanism. HERC5 interacts with L1 RNA and reduces ORF1p levels, a function that requires the ORF1 coding sequence. We further demonstrate that HERC5 decreases L1 translation efficiency and prevents the assembly of L1 RNPs. Our comparative analysis suggests that HERC5 may have acquired its L1-inhibitory function during the evolution of the small HERC family. These findings uncover a previously unidentified mechanism by which an ISG protein recognizes and inhibits L1 and suggest a role for HERC5 as an evolutionarily adapted restriction factor that expands the repertoire of cellular defenses against retrotransposons.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

While specific epistasis arises from direct physical interactions between mutations, non-specific epistasis emerges when a non-linear mapping links a proteins biophysical properties to its function. Enzyme kinetic parameters are assumed to be devoid of non-specific epistasis when measured in vitro, enabling direct connection of epistasis to the enzymes structural features. Here, we show that this assumption is incorrect: enzyme catalytic parameters like kcat and KM inherently exhibit non-specific epistasis due to the multi-state nature of the catalytic cycle. Using in silico enzyme models, parameterized by free energies of ground and transition states, we simulated 1000 \"mutations\" or perturbations to the sub-state free energies within the kinetic ensemble. We then combined these mutations, creating one million double mutants with strictly additive free energy effects. Despite the absence of explicit mutational interactions, we observed substantial epistasis in catalytic parameters; its prevalence and complexity increasing with the number of kinetic states in the mechanism. We derived analytical conditions for the emergence of this form of epistasis in a simple kinetic model, demonstrating that non-specific epistasis depends on the relative values of key microscopic rate constants. Finally, we validated our framework by reanalyzing kinetic data for double mutants in Bacillus cereus {beta}-lactamase I and found that reported specific epistasis in catalytic efficiency was substantially stronger than previously inferred, altering mechanistic interpretations. Our results identify an intrinsic, previously unknown source of epistasis that can distort both the magnitude and sign of mutational effects in enzyme kinetics.

Traditional methods often rely on sequence similarity, which can be challenging for rapidly evolving viruses. Pangenomes, offering a comprehensive representation of species genomic diversity, provide a richer perspective, but their analysis often requires advanced computational methods. We investigate the use of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA), an emerging computing paradigm that relies on vectors in high-dimensional spaces to encode a multi-species viral pangenome. We develop a new method for encoding graph-structured viral pangenomes using high-dimensional vectors. Pangenomes are represented as weighted de Bruijn graphs constructed using sequences of consecutive k-mers from the genomes, while information about the genome species (their class) is encoded as specific weights on the edges of the graph. The weighted de Bruijn graph representation is encoded into a single high-dimensional vector. We tested three classification strategies: a flat model at the species level, a flat model at the genus level, and a two-step hierarchical model. We applied our method to a pangenome comprising 542 viral species from NCBI GenBank. Our results reveal a complex relationship between model architecture and classification accuracy. The flat species-level model achieved the highest accuracy, correctly classifying 87.08% of test genomes. Counter-intuitively, simplifying the problem to the genus level or using a hierarchical approach degraded performance, with accuracies dropping to 60.51% and 33.57% respectively. These outcomes highlight critical challenges in alignment-free classification, such as signal dilution in overly broad taxonomic groups and error propagation in multi-step models. The model reconstruction rate proved to be a reliable measure of confidence, rather than a direct predictor of correctness.

A sexually dimorphic, reciprocal interaction between the ZG and the ZF in adapting to salt diets or DEX treatment was observed, involving changes in cell composition and transcriptional reprogramming of the three zones. Conclusion: HSD, LSD and DEX induce a sexually dimorphic cellular and transcriptional response, involving all layers of the adrenal cortex, and the reciprocal contribution of ZG and ZF cells, indicating functional interaction between adrenocortical zones in adapting to external cues.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

While strategies that block gut-homing have yielded partial success, this disease remains uncurable, leaving an unmet clinical need. This is the first paper to describe a role for cannabinoid receptor two (CB2R) signalling in promoting retinoic acid-mediated induction of the gut-homing associated integrin heterodimer 4{beta}7. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we characterised the effects of pharmacological CB2R agonists and inverse agonists on T cell homing receptor expression and transmigration across gut-associated endothelial barriers. This ERK-dependent process coincides with increased T cell adherence in response to CB2R agonism with JWH133. These effects were reversed with an inverse agonist GP-1a in a CB2R-dependent manner. Selective deletion of CB2R using CRISPR in vitro or CD4Cre/+ floxed mice in vivo resulted in impaired endothelial cell adherence and decreased diapedesis into the ileal lamina propria. T cell-specific deletion of cnr2, the gene encoding CB2R, attenuated chronic murine ileitis characterised by decreased naive T cell infiltration and loss of tissue architecture in 20wk TNF{delta}ARE/+ mice.

PTPN11 encodes SHP2, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical role in receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. In this study, we investigated lymphangiogenesis in mutant zebrafish embryos lacking functional Shp2 and demonstrate that Shp2 is essential for normal lymphatic development in the trunk and head regions of zebrafish embryos. Embryos lacking functional Shp2 failed to develop lymphatic vessels and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), whereas venous intersegmental vessel (vISV) formation remained unaffected. While endothelial cells sprouted normally from the posterior cardinal vein (PCV), they did not migrate to the horizontal myoseptum to form parachordal lymphangioblast (PL) cells. Rescue experiments using Shp2 mutants demonstrated that catalytic activity and signaling properties of Shp2 are required for restoration of normal lymphangiogenesis. These findings highlight a pivotal role for Shp2 signaling in the migration and differentiation of lymphatic endothelial cells without affecting venous angiogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

A.; Ramakrishnan, U.", "abstract": "Human impacts on ecosystems have accelerated globally, driving a 10% decline in terrestrial biodiversity and a 70% decline in wildlife populations over the past five decades. These losses are closely linked to habitat modification and fragmentation, highlighting the urgent need for management strategies grounded in a clear understanding of how wildlife use landscapes and navigate human-altered areas. Connectivity between populations is critical for species persistence, and is shaped by the interplay between landscape features and species movement. Most connectivity studies pursue application-focused goals, such as designing corridors or assessing land-use effects, often targeting single species within specific landscapes. While these approaches provide depth, they limit the development of general principles that apply across species and regions. Graph theory offers a powerful framework to distill complex connectivity patterns into comparable metrics, creating opportunities to identify such generalities. In this study, we examined connectivity patterns for 11 Indian carnivore species distributed across heterogeneous landscapes. Using secondary data, we developed habitat networks from species distribution models that incorporated both habitat quality and matrix resistance. We then applied graph theory to generate networks based on connectivity between identified habitat nodes, enabling comparisons across species and landscapes. Our results show that while connectivity patterns differ markedly among species, broad trends emerge. Larger-bodied species like tigers, which in our study are often threatened species, can overcome the effects of fragmentation better than smaller bodied species, however their connectivity is dependent on the existence of high quality patches. Fragmented and heterogenous landscapes were always associated with modular, less efficient networks irrespective of the species. Importantly, landscape characteristics had greater influence on network-level connectivity properties, while species traits more strongly determined node-level structural complexity of the network. By integrating network theory with multispecies analyses across diverse landscapes, our work moves beyond single-species case studies to identify general drivers of connectivity. In terms of conservation, our approach allows us to generate broad insights into drivers of population connectivity informing strategies for lesser-known species and guide more effective, landscape-scale management in an era of rapid environmental change.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

In particular, the X chromosome was extended to nearly twice its previous length, and putative pseudoautosomal regions were identified. Moreover, we report the first Y-linked scaffolds for this species. Comparative analyses with the zebra shark revealed exceptionally low substitution rates across the genome. We further detected a negative correlation between chromosome length and synonymous substitution rate (dS), explained by a positional gradient, designated as \"chromocline\", in which substitution rates gradually decrease from chromosomal ends toward central regions. Notably, the X chromosome exhibited low dS compared with autosomes of similar size, consistent with male-driven evolution.

Here, we report the first confirmed long-distance swim by a jaguar (Panthera onca) across an artificial lake and discuss its implications for landscape connectivity. Camera traps around Serra da Mesa Reservoir (Central Brazil) photographed an adult male on the mainland and later on a forested island. Flank-pattern matching confirmed a 100% identity between records. Geodesic analysis identified two possible routes: a direct 2.48 km crossing or an alternative path involving a stepping-stone islet (1.06 km + 1.27 km). In the absence of evidence for use of the islet, we conservatively adopt the largest continuous water segment (1.27 km) as the minimum distance swum. This represents nearly six times the longest previously verified jaguar swim ({approx} 200 m). The event supports a graduated-resistance framework in which water bodies exceeding 1 km impose high, but not insurmountable, costs to movement. We propose an ordinal aquatic-cost scale (1 = < 300 m; 3 = from 300 to 1,000 m with stepping-stones; 6 = > 1,000 m open water) for use in circuit-based connectivity models. By contrasting this record with predator collapse on > 1 km islands in Lake Guri and with genetic segregation across the Amazon River, we demonstrate that aquatic permeability is strongly context-dependent.

However, microtissues (e.g., cuboids, organoids, spheroids, etc.) can be difficult to place in precise locations, especially in applications that require their culture in hydrogels. Here, using cuboids from a mouse tumor model, we demonstrate a simple bioprinting strategy for precise placement and immobilization of cuboids in hydrogel. We use a commercial bioprinter to bioprint -containing hydrogel into arrays of small hydrogel dots containing cuboids, or cuboid dots, either onto a Transwell insert or into traps on a microplate. The hydrogel serves to immobilize the cuboids in place and provides a matrix to support cuboid viability. We demonstrate proof-of-concept applications for cancer drug testing and for protein profiling analysis. This approach will enable interface of cuboids with other devices, such as on top of a sensor or in a microfluidic platform.

Faced with this significant public health challenge, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have emerged as promising alternatives that may minimize the side effects associated with conventional treatments such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To support mAb research and development, IMGT(R), the international ImMunoGeneTics information system, has established two standardized data sources namely IMGT/mAb-DB, a comprehensive database for mAbs, and, more recently, IMGT/mAb-KG, a dedicated knowledge graph for mAbs. Despite these advances, the development of therapeutic mAbs remains both time-consuming and financially burdensome--costs can reach up to $2.8 billion. To address this challenge and accelerate cancer treatment, mAb repurposing represents a promising alternative. Results: In this study, we leveraged a subset of IMGT/mAb-KG, dedicated to the oncology domain, to develop a scientific hypothesis generation application for mAb repurposing. This application, based on knowledge graph embedding techniques, is designed to suggest potential mAb candidates for novel oncology applications. A user-friendly web interface provides access to the tool, incorporating visual support to facilitate the interpretation of generated hypotheses. This application is a decision support tool aiming to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic applications for existing mAbs. Conclusion: Our application demonstrates the potential of knowledge graph embedding techniques in the oncology domain by enabling the repurposing of existing mAbs for new therapeutic uses. Using this tool, we have identified two novel mAbs, loncastuximab tesirine and glofitamab, both currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

While the effects of dietary protein content and macronutrient ratios are well described, the metabolic costs of providing an imbalanced essential amino acid (EAA) supply in dietary proteins remain poorly understood. We examined how dietary EAA imbalance affects growth, metabolism, and energy allocation in BSFL. Larvae were reared on a reference diet (chicken feed) and three isonitrogenous, semi-synthetic diets: one balanced diet matching the EAA profile of the reference, and two unbalanced diets selectively deficient in either leucine, phenylalanine, and threonine or isoleucine, lysine, and tryptophan. Using open flow respirometry, daily growth monitoring, and biochemical analysis, we quantified gas exchange, body composition, and the energetic costs of biomass and protein deposition. EAA imbalance delayed development, reduced growth and protein content, and promoted lipid accumulation, while O2 consumption and CO2 production were reduced and respiratory exchange ratios exceeded 1.0, indicating elevated lipogenesis. Metabolic costs per unit protein deposited were higher on EAA-deficient diets (up to 3.99kJ per kJ protein), reflecting inefficient amino acid utilisation. In contrast, the balanced diet supported more efficient protein deposition at a lower energetic cost (2.92kJ per kJ protein). Our findings demonstrate that suboptimal dietary EAA profiles reduce metabolic efficiency in BSFL. Quantifying the physiological costs of amino acid imbalance provides benchmarks to guide feed formulations in insect production systems to minimise input costs and maximise the nutritional quality and quantity of larval output.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify the emergence of sexually dimorphic patterns of adipose tissue distribution and function during this critical post-weaning window. As subcutaneous adipocytes transition to a white phenotype, the microenvironment undergoes a coordinated remodelling, characterised by reduced innervation and increased immune cell content. Using a model of prolonged breastfeeding, we show that extended milk consumption promotes adipose tissue expansion through sex-dependent mechanisms, stimulating progenitor proliferation in males and adipocyte hypertrophy in females. In males, this hyperplasia is coupled with accelerated tissue whitening, mediated by enhanced clearance of extracellular noradrenaline by mature adipocytes.

Here we build FEMs into a minimal theoretical model of the early visual response, including the critical process of adaptation (a fading response to a fixed image). We establish the effect of FEMs on the mutual information between a visual stimulus and this response. Our approach identifies the key dimensionless parameters that characterise the effect of fixational eye movements, and reveals the regimes in which this effect can be beneficial, detrimental or negligible. Taking parameter values appropriate for human vision, we show that the spatio-temporal couplings induced by fixational eye movements can explain the qualitative features of the human contrast sensitivity function as well as classic experiments on temporal integration. To our knowledge, the consideration of fixational eye movements in this latter context is novel, and our results suggest the need for future experiments to determine the mechanisms by which spatial and temporal responses are coupled in the human visual system.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "The question of whether sleep deprivation is inherently lethal has remained unresolved due to the inability to separate pure sleep loss from experimental stress. Historical studies dating back over a century have consistently reported that prolonged wakefulness leads to death, but these findings have been confounded by the stressful nature of the experimental interventions used to maintain wakefulness. Recent work has suggested that sleep deprivation-induced lethality may result from accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestines, providing a potential molecular explanation for these long-standing observations. Here we address whether lethality stems from sleep loss itself or experimental stress using stress-controlled sleep deprivation in Drosophila and stress paradigms in both flies and mice. Using real-time feedback-controlled sleep deprivation in Drosophila -- which only stimulates animals when they attempt to sleep -- we found no lethality or intestinal ROS accumulation even after 240 hours of continuous wakefulness. In contrast, both physical perturbation and psychological challenges rapidly induced intestinal ROS accumulation independent of sleep loss, in flies and mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed entirely distinct molecular signatures between sleep deprivation and oxidative stress, demonstrating these represent fundamentally different biological challenges. However, while sleep deprivation alone caused no lethality or intestinal oxidative stress, it increased susceptibility to traumatic brain injury through enhanced synaptic strength. Sleep-deprived flies showed increased mortality when subjected to violent physical challenges, an effect that correlated with synaptic excitability rather than sleep duration, and was rescued by restorative recovery sleep or prevented in mutants lacking synaptic potentiation mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that experimental stress, not sleep loss, drives the oxidative damage and lethality historically attributed to sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation, however, creates conditional vulnerability by transforming the brain into a hyperexcitable state susceptible to trauma, rather than causing cumulative damage.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Within a generalized consumer-resource framework, we separate the mechanistic traits that shape dynamical responses and show that systems with identical NO can display opposite correlation patterns. The decisive predictor is the yield-depletion mismatch (YDM) - the mismatch between species' depletion and yield dissimilarities. Analytical theory, stochastic simulations, and a reanalysis of microbial time-series consistently show that YDM, not NO, sets the sign and magnitude of abundance correlations, whereas instantaneous growth-rate correlations increase with NO.

Traditionally, ecological factors have been the primary focus of species distribution studies, but recent work emphasizes the importance of rapid evolution through local adaptation. Here, we focus on adaptation to changing temperatures, which is one of the central challenges populations face today. Importantly, thermal adaptation may be affected by the underlying thermodynamics. Despite many existing models in the fields of thermal biology and spatial evolutionary ecology, there is little integrative theory. However, understanding and modelling the thermodynamic constraints on thermal adaptation is likely essential for more nuanced predictions of the impacts of climate change. By integrating molecular mechanisms and population dynamics in a unified modelling framework, we here study how temperature-dependent processes at the protein level influence the macroecological patterns of range expansions. Our results highlight the importance of the microscopic processes underlying thermal adaptation for capturing the evolutionary ecology of range expansions. Specifically, the molecular bases of thermal adaptation define how and how fast thermal performance can evolve, which determines range expansion speeds. In general, our framework predicts that adaptation to warmer temperatures will be easier than adaptation to cold.

B.; Elsayed, M.", "abstract": "The sensation of pain varies from person to person. These patterns of individual variations are difficult to capture using coarse subjective self-reports. However, they are important when prescribing therapies and tailoring them to the person 's own sensations. Pain can be experienced differently by the same person, and fluctuate differently depending on the context, yet most analyses treat the problem under a one-size-fits-all model. In this work, we introduce a series of assays to objectively assess pressure pain across tasks with different motoric and cognitive demands, in relation to resting state. In a cohort of healthy individuals, we examine pain-free vs. pain states at rest, during drawing with heavy cognitive demands, during pointing to a visual target, and during a grooved peg task like inserting a grooved key in a matching grooved keyhole. We recorded face videos, electrocardiographic signals and adopt a standardized data type called the micro-movement spikes (MMS) to characterize the biorhythmic activities of the face micro-expressions and of the micro-fluctuations in the heart 's inter beat interval timings. Using the MMS peaks, we find that the continuous Gamma family of probability distribution functions best fit the frequency histograms of both the Face and the heart data. Further, we find that the Gamma shape and scale parameters in both signals span a scaling power law whereby as the noise-to-signal ratio (Gamma scale parameter) increases, so does the randomness of the stochastic process (the Gamma shape decreases towards the memoryless exponential range). We find that as the heart IBI turns more erratic (noisier and more random) the facial ophthalmic region increases the noise and randomness too, with higher linear correlation for tasks requiring haptic feedback (R2 0.84) than for tasks requiring higher cognitive and memory loads (R2 0.77). Increases in transfer entropy shows that recent past activity (~167ms back) of the heart IBI and Face combined lower the uncertainty in the prediction of the present ophthalmic-Face activity, suggesting that this Face region may serve as a proxy of an increasingly dysregulated heart. These results bear implications for the detection and monitoring of pressure pain and heart dysregulated states.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

In keratinocytes, wound healing critically depends on dynamic modulation of adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Here, we applied wound healing assay and the combination of the stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy with the atomic force microscopy (AFM) (STED/AFM hybrid technique), to study E-cadherin binding properties during keratinocyte migration. Wound closure occurred within 6 h, an effect associated with E-cadherin accumulation at the leading edge. For location-specific binding measurements with the STED/AFM technique, we overexpressed E-cadherin in mouse keratinocytes and performed single molecule force spectroscopy measurements. Inhibition of actin polymerization abolished E-cadherin binding and further reduced overall cellular stiffness. To study adhesion mechanics during migration, we used the STED/AFM technique and performed single-molecule force spectroscopy at the leading edge of keratinocytes migrating into cell-free areas, generated by removal of two-well inserts. This approach enabled, for the first time, simultaneous measurements of single-molecule binding properties and cellular mechanistic properties in actively migrating keratinocytes. Our results revealed that E-Cad molecules present during migration exhibit binding properties comparable to those of E-Cad in stable AJs. This suggests that these molecules remain functional competent and may be readily available for rapid re-engagement in cell-cell adhesion when required. We introduce a powerful methodology to investigate single molecule binding properties in migrating cells, offering new opportunities to analyze epithelial repair at molecular resolution.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

A major challenge in addressing this burden is the lack of experimental systems that enable mechanistic studies and therapeutic screening in ageing haematopoiesis. Here, we evaluate a polymer-based ex vivo culture platform for studying human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the context of ageing. Using CD34 cells from cord blood, bone marrow and peripheral blood from different age groups, we show that this culture system enables robust expansion of HSPCs while preserving age-associated transcriptional programs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed enrichment of key progenitor populations with consistent transcriptional identities across donors. Importantly, expanded HSPCs from older individuals retained ageing-associated signatures, such as upregulation of inflammatory pathways. These findings demonstrate that our polymer-based expansion system enables robust modelling of ageing haematopoiesis and provide a single cell transcriptional landscape of this ageing model.

Decoding the regulatory mechanisms of condensation encoded within the amino acid sequences of condensate-forming proteins is essential for understanding both how intracellular condensates assemble and how they contribute to various disease pathologies. Here, we investigated the budding yeast P-body proteins Nst1 and Edc3, which exhibit pronounced intracellular self-condensation, and identified charged amino acid clusters in the low complexity regions (LCRs) that modulate their phase behavior. Guided by the stickers-and-spacers framework, we hypothesized that clusters of charged residues within IDRs function in promoting intracellular condensation process. Using a sliding-window approach, we designated and dissected the polyelectrolyte (PE) domains of Nst1 and Edc3 and established their essential contributions to condensate coalescence. In Nst1, the polyanionic (PA) subdomain enhances intermolecular attraction and promotes coalescence, whereas the polyampholyte (PAM) subdomain imparts rigidity to the condensate as a distinct modulatory element and recruits additional components into the condensate. PA of Edc3 also regulates coalescence. Extending these findings to the neurodegenerative disease-associated protein TDP-43, we show that its PA regions are critical for coalescence, consistent with the presence of negatively charged amino acid clusters as potent molecular stickers functioning in condensate coalescence in cells. These results highlight charged-residue clusters as versatile sequence determinants of phase behavior and indicate that their systematic identification will be pivotal to defining the molecular grammar of protein condensation underlying the condensation of disease-related proteins.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

HDR is initiated by the RAD51 single-stranded (ss)DNA nucleoprotein filament which conducts the homology search and invades a homologous DNA template, creating a displacement-loop (D-loop). The RAD51 filament is assisted in these processes by several proteins. One such protein is RAD51-Associated-Protein 1 (RAD51AP1) which binds DNA and RNA and directly interacts with RAD51. Of note, RAD51AP1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in several different cancer types. Here, we show that RAD51AP1 activity is regulated by phosphorylation. RAD51AP1 bearing S277/282A mutations is more proficient in the stimulation of D-loop formation than wild type RAD51AP1 or phosphomimetic RAD51AP1-S277/282D. In EMSAs, RAD51AP1 with S277/282A mutations more avidly binds ssDNA, double-stranded (ds)DNA, and the nucleosome core particle than wild type RAD51AP1 or RAD51AP1-S277/282D.

We uncover marked heterogeneity and reduced collectivity in the morphodynamics of the NB and its nearest neighbours, and suggest their origins in the morphogenetic activity in the extending germband. We show that the appearance and distribution of the NB and GMC fate determinants Deadpan/dpn and Prospero/pros respectively correlate temporally with distinct morphometric states.

Here, we implicate SLFN11 in sensing telomere replication stress, triggering eradication of ATRX deficient cells prior to ALT establishment. Whereas progressive telomere shortening of cells lacking telomerase and ATRX leads to telomere crisis and cell death, SLFN11 loss confers tolerance to PML-BLM dependent ALT intermediates, permitting emergence of ALT survivors.

In the short term, the presence of other strains delayed lysis and reduced EM1 virus production, indicating that community composition directly affects viral replication. In the long term, both Sal. ruber M1 and the EM1 virus persisted across all experimental conditions, but their evolutionary responses differed. The EM1 virus showed an increased mutation rate, reduced infectivity against the native host, and expanded host range when other viruses were present, suggesting a previously unrecognized form of virus-virus interaction, in which coexisting viruses influence each others evolutionary paths promoting viral diversification. In contrast, Sal. ruber M1 exhibited higher mutation rates evolving with other strains, indicating that in our system, intraspecific competition, rather than viral pressure, drives bacterial evolution.

A.; Rupp, O.; Goesmann, A.; Blumenkamp, P.; Sogaard-Andersen, L.", "abstract": "Exported polysaccharides have crucial functions in bacteria. Polysaccharide biosynthesis in the ubiquitous Wzx/Wzy- and ABC-transporter-dependent pathways starts with the transfer of a sugar-1-phosphate from a nucleotide-sugar donor to undecaprenyl phosphate, a reaction catalyzed by a phosphoglycosyl transferase (PGT). Both reaction substrates are limited and shared among multiple glycoconjugate pathways, raising the question of how bacteria regulate these pathways. In Myxococcus xanthus, EpsZ, which belongs to the family of large monotopic PGTs (monoPGTs), starts the Wzx/Wzy-dependent exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis. The Dif chemosensory system regulates EPS biosynthesis by an unknown mechanism via the phosphorylated single-domain response regulator EpsW (EpsW~P). Here, we show that EpsW~P stimulates EPS biosynthesis at the post-translational level. Moreover, MiniTurbo-based proximity labeling experiments suggest that EpsW~P interacts directly with EpsZ. Additionally, heterologous expression of these two proteins in Salmonella enterica demonstrates that EpsW stimulates EpsZ enzymatic activity. S. enterica WbaP, the prototype large monoPGT, forms a functional homodimer, with dimerization involving a distinct cytoplasmic {beta}-hairpin. However, AlphaFold-based structural modeling shows that EpsZ lacks this {beta}-hairpin, suggesting an alternative mechanism for dimerization. Our structural modeling of a EpsZ-EpsW heterocomplex suggests that EpsW~P, by direct interaction, promotes the formation of the stable EpsZ dimer. These findings uncover a new model for the regulation of polysaccharide biosynthesis in which EpsW~P allosterically facilitates the formation of the active, dimeric conformation of EpsZ, thereby activating EPS biosynthesis at its initial step. Genomics and structural modeling suggest that the regulation of large monoPGTs by a single-domain response regulator is widespread in myxobacteria and potentially beyond.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

DNA polymerase (Pol ) is most recognised for tolerating UV-induced DNA damage via translesion synthesis (TLS). However, emerging evidence suggests a broader contribution of error-prone polymerases to DNA synthesis. To elucidate the roles of Pol during unperturbed replication, we applied polymerase usage sequencing (Pu-seq) to map its activity genome-wide. Our findings demonstrate that Pol preferentially participates in lagging-strand replication, consistent with observations in budding yeast. Furthermore, Pol usage varied throughout S phase, with a pronounced enrichment in late-replicating domains, dependent on PCNA ubiquitylation. Under moderate doses of UV, Pol usage retained its replicative strand bias, which contrasted with the prominent strand bias observed in transcribed regions resulting from asymmetric repair processes. These results reveal that Pol 's flexibility and intrinsic coupling with replication forks extend beyond TLS in human cells. In cancer genomes, characteristic Pol mutations are enriched in late-replicating regions and correlate with RAD18 expression, implicating PCNA-mediated Pol activation in mutagenesis. Together, these findings reveal an unexpected bias in Pol usage during unperturbed replication which may represent a key contribution to the mutational burden in the human genome.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

The transcriptional co-activator, ENL, which is localized to chromatin through its acetyllysine-binding YEATS domain, is preferentially required for the survival and pathogenesis of acute leukemia. Small molecules that inhibit the ENL YEATS domain show anti-leukemia effects in preclinical models, which is thought to be caused by the downregulation of pro-leukemic ENL target genes. However, the transcriptional effects of ENL YEATS domain inhibitors have not been studied in models of intrinsic or acquired resistance and, therefore, the connection between proximal transcriptional effects and downstream anti-proliferative response is poorly understood. To address this, we identified models of intrinsic and acquired resistance and used them to study the effects of ENL YEATS domain inhibitors. We first discovered that ENL YEATS domain inhibition produces similar transcriptional responses in naive models of sensitive and resistant leukemia. We then performed a CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic modifier screen and identified in-frame deletions of the essential transcriptional regulator, PAF1, that confer resistance to ENL YEATS domain inhibitors. Using these drug-resistance alleles of PAF1 to construct isogenic models, we again found that the downregulation of ENL target genes is shared in both sensitive and resistant leukemia.

To date, comprehensive characterization of these systems has posed a formidable measurement challenge, as it requires time-course measurements of reactions involving endogenous components in addition to transcription and translation of a target genetic circuit added exogenously to the CFE reaction. To provide more informative characterization that is still easy to conduct and complements current practices, we demonstrate a measurement framework for transcription and translation dynamics. We use different nucleic acid templates to characterize a suite of Escherichia coli extracts prepared in house, as well as extracts and reconstituted systems available commercially. Notably, we include measurements of low-performing systems to assess the sensitivity of our measurement framework and elucidate metrics indicative of system performance. For all these CFE systems, we compute reaction metrics to enable quantitative comparison. We believe this is an accessible measurement framework that can complement existing characterization, provide informative data for developing CFE technologies, and be adopted for routine characterization.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

S.; VALENTE, A.; AGNEW, P.; COHUET, A.; CARRASCO, D.", "abstract": "Non-contact detection of pyrethroid insecticides by malaria mosquitoes has been unveiled and may contribute to the evolution of mosquito behavioral modifications against vector control tools. However, the mechanisms underlying this detection are not yet fully understood. It has been hypothesized that the spatial repellency of pyrethroids may be mediated by chemosensory receptors and/or via the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). This study aimed to explore these two hypotheses by identifying which chemosensory appendages in Anopheles gambiae are involved in the non-contact detection of permethrin, a widely used pyrethroid in malaria control. Behavioral responses to permethrin headspace were recorded in female An. gambiae, in which specific sensory appendages were either removed or coated with resin to impair their chemosensory function. Additionally, electrophysiological recordings were performed on different sensory appendages: antennae, palpi and tarsi, to characterize their electrophysiological activity after permethrin stimulation. The behavioral assays revealed that tarsi were primarily responsible for mediating mosquito takeoff responses after permethrin headspace delivery. This finding was supported by significant electrophysiological tarsal responses to the insecticide. In contrast, removal of the antennae did not alter behavioral responses, although electroantennogram recordings indicated neural activity in response to permethrin. Palps showed neither behavioral nor electrophysiological responses. These findings indicate that permethrin is detected through two distinct sensory appendages, tarsi and antennae, but with varying behavioral output. Such appendage-specific detection favors the hypothesis that permethrin detection and the associated behavioral output is mediated by chemosensory receptors rather than by VGSCs. Nonetheless, further investigations are needed to identify the chemosensory receptors and pathways involved in pyrethroid insecticide detection in malaria mosquitoes.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Using Caenorhabditis elegans SAB neurons as a model system, we showed that inhibition of muscle activity during a critical period of postembryonic development led to axonal overgrowth and ectopic synapse formation. This effect is mediated by a local retrograde signal and requires neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) acting cell-autonomously to constrain axon growth. Manipulating SAB neuron excitability demonstrated that increased intrinsic neuronal activity drives overgrowth, while reducing activity suppresses it, establishing a functional link between muscle-derived cues and presynaptic excitability. Transcriptomic analysis and genetic studies further implicate the neuropeptides FLP-18 and NLP-12 as essential modulators of this activity-dependent process. Our findings reveal a temporally and spatially restricted retrograde signaling mechanism in motor neurons, where target activity, neuronal calcium dynamics and neuropeptide signaling cooperate to ensure proper axon termination. These results highlight conserved principles of activity-dependent regulation at neuromuscular junctions and provide a framework for understanding how motor circuits integrate target feedback to sculpt precise connectivity.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Previous studies reported that TACI is a negative regulator of B cell survival. However, this conclusion is confounded by elevated levels of BAFF, a cytokine that supports B cell survival, in TACI-deficient mice. We now show that TACI does not directly regulate B cell survival but rather has a cell-intrinsic role in MZ B cell development. Loss of TACI leads to reduced MZ B cell numbers and impaired T-independent antibody responses. Mechanistically, we show that TACI is required for MZ B cell development from T2 B cell precursors via activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and subsequent inhibition of the FOXO1 transcription factor.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

The EPS integrates materials from the surrounding environment, such as metal ions, to provide additional mechanical protection to the embedded bacteria from environmental stressors. While previous studies demonstrated metal ions impact the erosion behavior of biofilms, key quantitative properties, such as yield stress, remain largely undocumented due to difficulties in handling these viscoelastic and soft biomaterials. In this work, we introduce a technique to characterize the impact of metal ions on the uniaxial stress-strain response of bacterial biofilms. Through applying this method to Bacillus subtilis pellicles, we demonstrate that the absorption of selective metal ions into the EPS significantly increases both the elastic modulus and yield stress, while decreasing failure strain. Notably, this effect can be reversed through the introduction of a strong chelating agent; while variations in pH alone have a negligible impact on measured mechanical properties. We compare our results to previous biofilm erosion studies and provide insights into how metal ions interactions can alter the mechanical behavior of biofilms, which will aid in future biofilm mitigation strategies for biofouling or healthcare applications.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we uncovered a Wnt-induced DVL phospho-switch which is mutually exclusive with FZD engagement. CK1 multiphosphorylation changes dramatically the bulk electrostatics to promote DVL intramolecular coupling between the DEP domain and the adjacent disordered region. A panel of phospho-switch mutants demonstrated a switch-like coupling at the molecular level when a charge threshold is reached. Charge accumulation proximal to DEP proved to be a key functional event required, but not sufficient, for Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling.

C.", "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a significant role in regulating the mammalian epigenome, with emerging evidence suggesting imbalances in the cellular redox state trigger stress-responsive epigenetic modifications that drive various human diseases. However, it remains unclear whether, like worms, epigenetic changes caused by redox imbalance or mitochondrial stress can move through the mammalian germline, potentially affecting the health of future generations. Antioxidant therapies are commonly used to reduce oxidative damage and are widely employed in cases of male infertility, where high-dose supplementation is often recommended to enhance sperm quality and overall measures of male reproductive health. Interestingly, in non-stressed, ostensibly healthy males, recent research suggests that antioxidants may have a negative influence on sperm epigenetic markers, indicating a potential epigenetic liability. However, whether male antioxidant treatment can induce paternal effects on offspring growth and development remains unknown. Here, we employed micro-CT imaging and geometric morphometrics to determine whether chronic antioxidant supplementation in healthy male mice affects placental growth and craniofacial development in their offspring. Adult C57BL/6J male mice were given a six-week preconception regimen of N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 400 mg/kg/day) and selenium (0.04 mg/kg/day), which continued throughout breeding with treatment-naive females. Although we observed modest alterations to the histological patterning of the female placenta, placental weights and efficiency remained unchanged. In contrast, we observed significant changes in facial shape and symmetry in both male and female offspring, with female offspring exhibiting significant reductions in eye spacing and head area. These changes occurred without any macro changes in paternal metabolic health, indicating that antioxidant-induced shifts in redox balance may disrupt developmental programming in the male germline independent of changes in overall health. Our findings emphasize the need for caution when using antioxidants as preconception interventions and broadly suggest that modulation of the paternal redox axis may result in altered developmental programming and teratogenic effects.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

With two independently young origins of dioecy in the genus, Asparagus is a model taxon for studying genetic sex-determination and sex chromosome evolution. Dioecy first evolved in Asparagus ~3-4 million years ago (Ma) in the ancestor of a now widespread Eurasian clade that includes garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis), while the second origin occurred in a smaller, geographically restricted, Mediterranean Basin clade including Asparagus horridus. The XY sex chromosomes and sex-determination genes in garden asparagus have been well characterized, but the genetics underlying dioecy in the Mediterranean Basin clade are unknown. We generated new haplotype-resolved reference genomes for garden asparagus and A. horridus, to elucidate the sex chromosomes of A. horridus and explore how dioecy evolved between these two closely related lineages. Analysis of the A. horridus genome revealed an independently evolved XY system derived from different ancestral autosomes (chromosome 3) with different sex-determining genes than documented for garden asparagus (on chromosome 1). We estimate that proto-XY chromosomes evolved around 1-2 Ma in the Mediterranean Basin clade, following an ~2.1-megabase inversion between the ancestral pair. Recombination suppression and LTR retrotransposon accumulation drove the establishment and expansion of the Y-linked sex-determination region (Y-SDR) that now reaches ~9.6-megabases in A. horridus. The new garden asparagus genome revealed a Y-SDR that spans ~1.9-megabases with ten hemizygous genes. Our results evoke hemizygosity as the most probable mechanism responsible for the origin of proto-XY recombination suppression in the Eurasian clade, and that neofunctionalization of one duplicated gene (SOFF) drove the origin of dioecy. These findings support previous inference based on phylogeographic analysis revealing two recent origins of dioecy in Asparagus. Moreover, this work implicates alternative molecular mechanisms for two separate shifts to dioecy in a model taxon important for investigating young sex chromosome evolution.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Here we evaluated genome accessibility and nuclear organization of cultured primary human cells at 24 and 48 hours after infection with wildtype AAV2, single-stranded (ss) and self-complementary (sc) recombinant AAV2. Genome-wide ATAC-seq showed no detectable change in host chromatin accessibility at either time point. A DNase I digestion assay at five candidate loci supported this observation. In contrast, immunofluorescence imaging revealed modest decreases in histone H3, H3K27me3, and RNA polymerase II signals, consistent with reduced polymerase engagement under stress-linked pathways. H3K4me3 deviated from this pattern in G1 cells upon scAAV2 infection, where signals increased. Nuclear geometry shifted in parallel with protein signals, with changes in area, perimeter, convexity, and eccentricity. Markers of nuclear condensates also changed, including reduced fibrillarin, SP100, and SRSF2 intensities, altered object shape metrics, and higher counts of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies and nuclear splicing speckles (NSs). Collectively, at the tested doses and times, AAV2-based vectors did not remodel chromatin accessibility at scale and induced only small changes in polymerase associated readouts and nuclear architecture.

We propose that the multilayer organization of guanine platelets with varying orientations across the tissue offers a particularly effective strategy for producing diverse optical effects.

To study FLASH mechanisms in brain tissue, we developed a novel experimental platform featuring a unique high-energy electron linear accelerator (High Intensity Gamma Source, HIGS) paired with an organotypic ex vivo brain metastasis model. Methods: We varied inter-pulse spacing to modulate the mean dose rate (MDR) of our unique 35 MeV electron beam, while maintaining extremely high instantaneous dose rate (IDR), and used film dosimetry to characterize dosimetry and targeting accuracy. We combined this HIGS-FLASH beam with an organotypic rat brain slice/breast carcinoma co-culture model of brain metastasis to assess effects on normal and neoplastic tissues. Live cell and bioluminescence imaging demonstrated cancer cell growth effects, while normal tissue responses and immune activation were assessed with live cell imaging, cytokine profiles, and confocal microscopy. We performed comparison experiments with 20 MeV electrons from a Varian clinical linear accelerator (VCLA) operating at conventional dose rate. Results: The highest IDR of the HIGS-FLASH beam to-date was 20.7 +/- 0.6 MGy/s, with maximum MDR of 20.7 MGy/s (1 microsecond pulse of 20.7 Gy). Beam targeting was accurate to < 1 mm and reproducible. HIGS-FLASH and VCLA dose rates equivalently decreased cancer cell growth. HIGS-FLASH irradiation significantly increased TNF-alpha and fractalkine levels and confocal microscopy revealed distinct changes in microglial morphology in normal brain slices, suggesting microglia activation following HIGS-FLASH irradiation. Conclusions: Our novel experimental platform produces extremely high dose rates and rapid normal/neoplastic tissue readouts for mechanistic research into the effects of FLASH radiation on the brain. HIGS-FLASH irradiation induces comparable cancer cell growth inhibition but differential effects on cytokines and microglial morphology, suggesting that acute innate immune responses may be involved in FLASH normal tissue effects in the brain.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Currently, there is no established standard-of-care treatment for this subtype, and chemotherapy response rates are only ~4%. One defining characteristic of LGSOC is a high prevalence of mutations within the MAPK pathway, which has motivated studies using MEK inhibitors to treat this disease. A recent phase II/III clinical trial using trametinib to treat patients with recurrent LGSOC improved the response rate to 26%; however, all patients eventually progressed due to the emergence of therapeutic resistance. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating combined inhibition of MEK and FAK with avutometinib plus defactinib for LGSOC patients, with preliminary results demonstrating response rates near 50%. While these results are highly encouraging, a significant subset of patients still fails to respond to existing targeted treatments. Additionally, development of therapeutic resistance in initial responders remains a major obstacle. Here, we sought to characterize molecular responses of LGSOC to MEK inhibition, both acutely and during the development of spontaneous drug resistance, with a goal of identifying adaptive mechanisms LGSOC cells utilize to withstand MAPK inhibition. Our research identified significant upregulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in response to MEK inhibition. While targeted inhibition of AKT had minimal impact on its own, combination with MEK inhibitors produced strong synergistic suppression of proliferation in LGSOC cells. This combination strategy could potentially be used to prevent or reverse the emergence of MEK inhibitor resistance in LGSOC patients.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

We hypothesize that the SEMG1 effects are associated with the inhibition of CatSper, a sperm-specific calcium channel crucial for triggering hyperactivation. We observed that recombinant mouse SEMG1 (mSEMG1) inhibited both progressive motility and hyperactivation in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, hyperactivation was not recovered upon NH4Cl-induced alkalinization, suggesting that the effects of mSEMG1 are downstream of capacitation-associated intracellular alkalinization. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that mSEMG1 impaired CatSper currents at concentrations near its IC50 for inhibiting sperm hyperactivation. Recombinant mSEMG1 truncations mSEMG1Q32-V118 and mSEMG1R98-G375, but not mSEMG1Y221-G375, independently inhibited sperm hyperactivation and CatSper currents similar to full-length mSEMG1. However, only mSEMG1R98-G375 displayed similar EPPIN-binding capacity comparable to full-length mSEMG1, whereas mSEMG1Q32-V118 and mSEMG1Y221-G375 showed only minor binding. Our findings reveal that mouse SEMG1 comprises two distinct functional domains within the Q32-V118 and R98-S220 sequences, which contribute to the inhibition of sperm hyperactivation by targeting the CatSper channel, both independently and dependent on EPPIN binding. These functional domains represent promising prototypes for the design of spermiostatic molecules, offering additional avenues for non-hormonal male contraception targeting spermatozoa.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

Globally, tens of millions of people are exposed to elevated manganese levels through drinking water, exceeding the WHO recommended guideline. Despite its public health significance, the cellular and subcellular mechanisms underlying manganese neurotoxicity remain poorly defined, particularly its distribution across brain cell types and its specific intracellular targets. In this study, we investigated manganese accumulation in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and astrocytes. Using a correlative imaging approach that combined cryo-fluorescence light microscopy with synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging, we mapped and quantified manganese at subcellular resolution. Our analysis revealed that manganese preferentially accumulates in the Golgi apparatus of both neurons and astrocytes. In neurons, manganese was also detected in dendrites at the postsynaptic density, suggesting a role in synaptic vulnerability. Quantitative elemental analysis showed that astrocytes accumulated 3 times more manganese than neurons. Furthermore, when neurons were co-cultured with astrocytes, their manganese uptake was significantly reduced, indicating a possible protective or buffering role of astrocytes. These findings identify key cellular and subcellular targets of manganese and highlight the Golgi apparatus as a major regulator of manganese neurotoxicity. This work provides a foundation for understanding cell type-specific responses to manganese exposure and may inform the development of targeted neuroprotection strategies.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

However, even with the use of TIL therapy, cancer cells can survive for various reasons, such as poor lymphocyte infiltration into tumors, chronic activation of the T cell receptor and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Cytokine-inducible SH2-containing (CISH) protein is a negative regulator of T cell activation, and in a recent clinical trial was knocked out in TILs to improve TIL therapy efficacy. In this study, we developed a mechanistic signaling pathway model to theoretically evaluate the efficacy of CISH knockout (CISH KO) in T cell activation and examine potential alternative target genes that can theoretically be targeted using multiplex gene-editing or drugs to further improve T cell activation and function. Our modeling results demonstrate that CISH knockout increases the transcription of activation biomarkers IL-2 and TNF-a, but also inhibitory biomarkers such PD1 and FasL. Using global sensitivity analysis, we also found that GSK3B, which is responsible for the deactivation of the NFAT, is also predicted to further increase T cell activation when knocked out. In addition, we predict that PDCD1, FAS and CTLA4 can be knocked-out in combination with CISH to further enhance T cell activation and prevent exhaustion and apoptosis.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

We previously found that the glycine cleavage system (GCS) is needed for intracellular growth. The GCS decarboxylates glycine for generation of 1C-tetrahydrofolates (1C-THF), folate dependent one carbon donors needed for biosynthesis of other metabolites. We continued our studies on the GCS and show that a L. monocytogenes {Delta}gcvPAB mutant, lacking the GCS glycine dehydrogenase, is attenuated without resembling the phenotype of classical virulence factor mutants. The {Delta}gcvPAB mutant also grew poorly in synthetic medium, explained by the presence of glycine that was toxic for this strain. Selection of glycine resistant suppressors yielded a survivor, in which the N- and C-terminal parts of the formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase (fhs) gene, which is naturally separated into two parts by a premature stop codon in the L. monocytogenes reference strain EGD-e, were reassembled into a full-length open reading frame. Like the GCS, Fhs also feeds the 1C-THF pool and its restoration cured the virulence defects of the {Delta}gcvPAB mutant. Another suppressor had a mutated glyA gene, encoding serine hydroxymethyltransferase, and combinatorial deletions of gcvPAB and glyA in fhs0 and fhs+ backgrounds demonstrated a role of GlyA in 1C-THF metabolism. Our results show that three pathways feed the 1C-THF pool to support growth and virulence of L. monocytogenes and represent the first example of the spontaneous reactivation of a L. monocytogenes gene that is inactivated by a premature stop codon.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

S.; Gura, C.; Sandkvist, M.", "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria employ the Type II Secretion System (T2SS) to not only secrete an array of soluble effectors such as toxins to the extracellular space, but also to facilitate the surface localization of enzymes and adhesins that are beneficial to life in different environments. For example, the pullulan degrading enzyme pullulanase (PulA) from Klebsiella pneumoniae and the recently discovered adhesin InvL from Acinetobacter baumannii are initially expressed with a lipobox containing signal peptide, resulting in their N-terminal acylation and subsequent surface anchoring after T2SS mediated export. While outer membrane translocation of both soluble and surface associated T2SS effectors depends on the T2SS secretin GspD, it is unclear how lipoproteins are accommodated by the T2SS during transport to the cell surface. Here, we identify a role for GspN in the outer membrane translocation of InvL in the opportunistic pathogen A. baumannii. Additional putative lipoproteins are found to have a similar GspN dependence for secretion, while soluble proteins are secreted independently of GspN. We demonstrate that a specific sorting motif C-terminal to the lipobox is required for GspN-dependent surface localization. Based on structural predictions, GspN belongs to the larger AsmA-like protein family that includes both eukaryotic and prokaryotic members. This protein family has been implicated in phospholipid transport, but here we expand the role for this family to include transport of lipoproteins. We also confirm that the GspN homolog PulN is required for PulA surface localization in K. pneumoniae.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "A subset of familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) are caused by mutations to copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn SOD1). There are over 200 mutations to SOD1 that have been associated with fALS and the majority of these mutations are dominantly inherited. Thus, individuals are heterozygous and express both wild-type SOD1 and the mutant form of the protein. Paradoxically, when rodent models are produced that mimic the co-expression of wild-type SOD1 with mutant fALS SOD1 the motor neuron disease accelerates. Previously, we have shown that the loss of zinc from an SOD1 kills cultured motor neurons due to a gained, redox activity catalyzed by the active-site copper. Furthermore, motor neuron toxicity of zinc-deficient SOD1 is enhanced by wild-type Cu, Zn SOD1. Because SOD1 exists as a non-covalent dimer, the enhanced toxicity might result from stabilization of the heterodimeric interface between zinc-deficient SOD1 and Cu, Zn-SOD1. However, experimentation with the heterodimer is difficult because SOD1 subunits exchange in minutes. To better characterize the role of dimer stabilization on the enhanced toxicity of fALS mutant SOD1 by wild type SOD1, we genetically tethered a zinc-deficient SOD1 subunit with a Cu, Zn SOD1 subunit with a 16-residue linker. The x-ray structure of the tethered heterodimer shows that zinc-deficient subunit adopts a wild-type-like conformation and is not misfolded. The heterodimer intermediate also produced peroxynitrite from nitric oxide, and the tethered SOD1 was strikingly toxic to primary cultures of motor neurons. This work supports the concept that zinc-deficient SOD1 is a likely toxic intermediate in ALS. Furthermore, the wild-type allele in human familial-SOD1 ALS patients may physically contribute to the dominant inheritance of SOD1 mutations through heterodimer formation.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

J.; Abriata, L. A.; Correia, B. E.", "abstract": "A hallmark of living systems is their ability to respond and adapt to many types of exogenous and endogenous cues. At the core of this capability lie the evolved mechanisms of cellular signaling which perform the relay of biochemical signals throughout the cell. Much of this core signaling functionality in living systems is afforded by the ability of proteins to change their chemical and structural status, by populating distinct states in conformational landscapes, undergoing post-translational modifications that alter these populations, and dynamically interacting with other cellular partners. Despite the remarkable advances we have witnessed in computational protein design, it remains an outstanding challenge to rationally design many of these aspects that are at the core of biological function. Here, we set out to design a minimal signaling network triggered by phosphorylation, which relies on de novo components that sample low-populated conformational states to control a designed protein interaction. In these designed components we implemented principles of signal amplification, conformational heterogeneity and molecular recognition which are ubiquitously used by nature to sustain biological function in cells. The designed proteins were biochemically and structurally characterized and ultimately are functional in cell-based systems where they regulate the transcription of reporter proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Overall, this work lays the foundation for designing synthetic signaling cascades using de novo protein components, which could be important to enhance our understanding of natural systems and for relevant applications in synthetic biology.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

R.; Van Deventer, J. A.", "abstract": "Noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) enable diversification of protein functions, but the efficiency of genetic code expansion (GCE) in eukaryotes is hindered by competition between suppressor tRNAs and release factors. Prior work has identified eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) mutants that improve ncAA incorporation, suggesting that screens for improved variants may lead to further enhancements. Here, we developed a high-throughput system to screen eRF1 mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae where eRF1 mutants are coexpressed on a plasmid alongside genomically encoded, wild-type eRF1. This strategy enabled recovery of live cells expressing eRF1 variants that enhance ncAA incorporation, even with mutants known to severely affect cell viability in the absence of WT eRF1 expression. We prepared and screened a million-member library of randomly mutated eRF1 variants for clones exhibiting improved ncAA integration phenotypes. Deep sequencing revealed a diverse set of enriched mutations across all three major domains of eRF1. Interestingly, several enriched mutations identified here are also found in naturally occurring eRF1 homologs from species that recode canonical stop codons. When eRF1 variants were combined with yeast knockout strains also known to enhance ncAA incorporation, this resulted in further improvements to efficiency, highlighting the complementarity of release factor engineering to other GCE enhancement strategies. This work demonstrates that high-throughput engineering of the eukaryotic translational apparatus is a powerful approach to identify previously unknown solutions for enhancing ncAA incorporation, with implications for elucidating and precisely manipulating the molecular functions of essential translational machinery.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

N.; Smid, R.; Louie, N.; Flibotte, S.; Jan, E.; Foster, L.", "abstract": "The interferon response is a signaling pathway unique to vertebrates that links the innate and adaptive immune responses. Interferons signal through a cascade of factors including the JAK-STAT pathway to induce the transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although the main interferon signal transduction pathways and ISGs have been elucidated, translational regulation of ISG transcripts is not fully understood. Prior work demonstrated that ribosomal protein RPL28 negatively regulates a subset of ISGs; however, we find that this effect may be due to a reduction in overall ribosome availability. Multi-omics analysis of RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS data reveal proteins, including several ISGs, that are translationally up-regulated in IFN-{beta}-stimulated cells depleted of ribosome biogeneis factor BOP1. Analysis of codon usage demonstrates a significant reduction in codon optimality for proteins that are translationally up-regulated during BOP1 knockdown and IFN-{beta} stimulation. Using reporter constructs, we demonstrate that codon non-optimal reporters are translated more than codon-optimized reporters in BOP1-depleted IFN-{beta} cells. We propose that ribosome biogenesis regulates translational fine-tuning of integral protein production to ensure optimal interferon responses.", "date": "2025-09-10", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "The development of prediction models for phenotypes as functions of genetics and environmental inputs is a long-standing challenge in genetics and plant breeding. Deep neural networks form a promising approach to this task, due to their capacity to approximate nonlinear biological processes. Despite initial expectations, recent studies have found deep neural networks under-performing in comparison to linear methods, even for continent-scale trial datasets. We attribute this to several failure modes of deep learning, including greedy learning, the tendency of deep neural networks to over-emphasize a single type of input data. As a solution, we present the Structured Interaction Neural Network (SINN), which combines statistical decomposition of genetic, environmental and interaction effects with deep neural networks. SINN dissects phenotype prediction into isolated component modeling tasks, revealing poor generalization of learned representations to new environments to be the main limitation for both prediction of genotype-by-environment interactions and yield prediction overall. By balancing model complexity and regularization per component, we reach competitive performance on yield prediction in the next cycle of a maize multi-environment trial, including both new genotypes and new environmental conditions. SINN achieved a higher accuracy (0.63) than BLUP-based methods (0.43) and a neural network from previous literature (0.48), and surpassed the top-performing models in a public benchmark dataset with a lower RMSE (2.41 Mg/ha versus 2.46 Mg/ha, with mean yield of 9.51 Mg/ha) and higher genetic correlation (0.38 versus 0.36).
