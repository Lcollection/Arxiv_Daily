R.", "abstract": "The quantitative determination of the effects of antimicrobials is essential for our understanding of pharmacodynamics and for their rational clinical application. Common pharmacodynamic measures of antimicrobial efficacy, such as the MIC and the pharmacodynamic function, fail to capture the observed dependence of efficacy on the bacterial population size - a phenomenon called inoculum effect. We assessed the relationship between bacterial inoculum size and pharmacodynamic relationship and determined the consequences of the inoculum effect on bacterial population dynamics with a mathematical multi-hit model that explicitly describes the interaction between antimicrobial molecules with their targets on the bacterial cells. Our model showed that the inoculum effect can arise from the binding dynamics of antimicrobial molecules to bacterial targets alone. A pharmacodynamic function extended by the inoculum effect on its parameters was able to predict the long-term population dynamics of simple scenrios well. More complex scenarios, however, were only captured with by the mechanistically more explicit multi-hit model. In simulations with competing antimicrobial-susceptible and -resistant bacteria, neglecting the inoculum effect led to an overestimation of the competitive ability of the resistant strain. Our work underpins the importance of including the inoculum effect into quantitative pharmacodynamic frameworks, and provides approaches to accomplish that.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}
{"title": "A bacterial regulatory uORF senses multiple classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics", "doi": "10.1101/682021", "authors": "Baniulyte, G.; Wade, J.", "abstract": "Expression of many bacterial genes is regulated by cis- and trans-acting elements in their 5' upstream regions (URs). Cis-acting regulatory elements in URs include upstream ORFs (uORF), short ORFs that sense translation stress that manifests as ribosomes stalling at specific codons within the uORF. Here, we show that the transcript encoding the Escherichia coli TopAI-YjhQ toxin-antitoxin system is regulated by a uORF that we name \"toiL\". We propose that in the absence of translation stress, a secondary structure in the UR represses translation of the topAI transcript by occluding the ribosome-binding site. Translation repression of topAI leads to premature Rho-dependent transcription termination within the topAI ORF. At least five different classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics relieve repression of topAI. Our data suggest that these antibiotics function by stalling ribosomes at different positions within toiL, thereby altering the RNA secondary structure around the topAI ribosome-binding site. Thus, toiL is a multipurpose uORF that can respond to a wide variety of translation stresses.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

This is the case for zooplankton species which ensure the coupling between primary producers and fishes in pelagic food webs. Here, we measured lifespan, reproduction and mobility of laboratory-raised water fleas Daphnia magna, a widespread freshwater zooplankton species, in response to continuous broadband noise. Surprisingly, we found a significant increase in survival and fecundity, leading to a higher individual fitness when considering total offspring production and a slight increase in population growth rate, according to the Euler-Lotka equation. Exposed water fleas were found slower than control individuals and we discussed potential links between mobility and fitness. Our results can have implications in aquaculture and for in-lab studies (e.g., in ecotoxicology) where the acoustic environment receives little attention. Chronic broadband noise can be associated with certain human activities but the consequences on natural Daphnia populations might differ as reduced velocity could have negative outcomes when considering competition and predation. Our work is one of the few showing an effect of noise on individual fitness and suggests that noise should be better accounted for in laboratory studies.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

This prompted us to investigate the gastrointestinal tropism of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the Wuhan-like Hong Kong strain, highly pathogenic Delta, and highly transmissible but mildly pathogenic Omicron variants in hamsters. Delta was the most pathogenic in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, followed by ancestral Wuhan-like and Omicron strains. In the gastrointestinal tract, viral RNA load was significant in the proximal organs such as the oesophagus and stomach, highest in the SI, and minimal to undetectable in the colon. Additionally, all three variants reduced fecal microbial diversity, with the Delta causing the highest decrease in observed features and phylogenetic diversity.

Here, we extend this classical, community-centred view by showing that positive complexity-diversity and complexity-productivity relationships may also emerge from between-age-class, intra-specific interactions at a single-population level. In the laboratory, we show that medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) are strongly cannibalistic in complexity-free habitats, and that cannibalism may occur over a wide range of victim/cannibal body size ratios. In replicated outdoor pond populations, we manipulated habitat structural complexity using floating artificial structures, which selectively hampered movements of large-bodied medaka. Habitat complexity relaxed the strength of cannibalism, resulting in (1) increased survival of age-0+ individuals, (2) elevated age-class diversity, (3) increased population growth rate, and (4) dampened negative density-dependence in the stock-recruitment relationship reflecting elevated habitat carrying capacity. The resultant higher population density in complex habitats was associated with increased competition for food among both age-0+ and age-1+ individuals. Our results highlight that positive complexity-diversity and complexity-productivity relationships may be considered as a generally-emergent property of size-structured populations and communities in which a larger body size brings a predation or interference advantage. Hence, enhancement of habitat structural complexity may be seen as a pivotal management strategy not only in favour of taxonomic diversity, but also to increase the productivity and resilience of exploited populations and to improve the conservation status of endangered species.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

In the gastrointestinal tract, this transport indirectly impacts nutrient absorption. However, the mechanisms governing ion transport through these channels remain poorly understood. We addressed this question by building on our previous cell culture studies and all atom molecular dynamic simulation model of CLDN15. By mutating D55 to a bulkier glutamic acid (E) or neutral amino acid asparagine (N), our in vitro measurements showed that the D55E mutation decreased charge selectivity and favored small ion permeability, while the D55N mutation led to reduced charge selectivity without markedly altering size selectivity. By establishing a simplified (reduced) CLDN15 molecular dynamics model that excludes non-essential transmembrane regions, we were able to probe how D55 modified cation dehydration, charge interaction, and permeability. These results provide novel insight into organization of the CLDN15 selectivity filter and suggests that D55 plays a dual role in shaping both electrostatic and steric properties of the pore, but its electrostatic role is more prominent in determining CLDN15 cation permeability. This knowledge can be used toward the development of effective strategies to modulate CLDN15 function. The experimental approach established can be further extended to study the function of other claudin channels.

We propose altering approximately 5% of the current annotations in the widely used reference strain S288c. Potential null alleles are common and found in all 94 strains examined, with these potential null alleles typically containing a single stop codon or frameshift. There are also gene remnants, pseudogenes, and variable arrays of genes. Among the core genes there are now only 364 protein coding genes of unknown function, classified as uncharacterized in the Saccharomyces Genome Database.

Here, we utilized an attenuated non-pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes to deliver a highly immunogenic Tetanus Toxoid protein (Listeria-TT), as a neoantigen surrogate, into tumor cells through infection in a metastatic mouse ovarian cancer model (Id8p53-/-Luc). Gemcitabine (GEM) was added to reduce immune suppression. Listeria-TT+GEM treatments resulted in tumors expressing TT and reactivation of pre-existing CD4 and CD8 memory T cells to TT (generated early in life). These T cells were then attracted to the TT-expressing tumors now producing perforin and granzyme B. This correlated with a strong reduction in tumor burden, and significant improvement of the survival time compared to all control groups. Checkpoint inhibitors have little effect on ovarian cancer partly because of low neoantigen expression. Here we demonstrated that Listeria-TT+GEM+anti-PD1 was significantly more effective (efficacy and survival) than anti-PD1 or Listeria-TT+GEM alone. Of clinical interest, high doses of anti-PD1 (PD1H) (when added to Listeria-TT+GEM) were less effective than the low doses (PD1L). IHC and ELISPOT demonstrated that high doses of anti-PD1 inhibited T cell function in the TME. Using RNAseq, Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG) analysis and Genes Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that gene expression levels and biological pathways were predominantly upregulated in the PD1H compared to the PD1L group, in correlation with low immune infiltration in tumors, more immune suppression, and more aggressive ovarian cancer.

One of the major hurdles to overcome when training trait prediction models is the high dimensionality of the data, with the number of features (target CpGs) greatly exceeding the typical number of samples assessed. In addition, most large-scale DNA methylation-based studies do not include replicate measurements for a given sample, making it impossible to estimate the degree of measurement uncertainty or the reliability of the prediction models. A recent study proposed that training penalized regression models on derived principal components (PCs) rather than on the original features (CpGs) results in more reliable age predic- tions, as estimated from technical replication. Moreover, the same method could be applied for predicting other phenotypes more reliably. Here, we aimed at validating the proposed PC method. We found that although dimension reduction with PCA consistently led to small improvements in the reliability of age prediction models, it severely compromised their accuracy. PC-based models needed far larger training set sizes to be similarly accurate as CpG-based models, whereas reliability did not depend on the sample size of the training set data for either approach. Finally, the PC version of a novel multiclass predictor for breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer we trained using weighted ensembles of deep-learning models also had a markedly lower predictive accuracy compared to a CpG version, suggesting limited applicability of the proposed PC method for predicting phenotypes beyond age.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

SlimVar uses rapid photobleaching to resolve tracked particles to molecular steps in intensity. By modifying widefield microscopy to minimise optical aberrations and robustly post-process few-photon signals, SlimVar mitigates performance losses at depth. We use SlimVar to quantify chromatin-protein assemblies in nuclei, finding that two homologous proteins key to epigenetic switching at FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) - cold-induced VERNALISATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3) and constitutively expressed VERNALISATION 5 (VRN5) - exhibit dynamic assemblies during FLC silencing. Upon cold exposure, the number of assembly molecules increases up to 100% to a median of ~20 molecules. Larger VRN5 assemblies preferentially colocalise with an FLC lacO transgenic reporter during prolonged cold and persist after return to warmth.

The diversity within each clade as a function of sex chromosome evolution though is largely unknown. Here, we anchor ourselves to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where dosage compensation is accomplished by an X chromosome specific condensin that belongs to the family of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes. By combining a phylogenetic analyses of the C. elegans dosage compensation complex with a comparative analysis of its epigenetic signatures, such as X-specific topologically associating domains (TADs) and enrichment of H4K20me1, we show that the condensin-mediated mechanism evolved recently in the lineage leading to Caenorhabditis following an SMC-4 duplication. Unexpectedly, we found an independent duplication of SMC-4 in Pristionchus pacificus along with the presence of X-specific TADs and H4K20me1 enrichment, which suggests that condensin-mediated dosage compensation evolved more than once in nematodes. Differential expression analysis between sexes in several nematode species indicates that dosage compensation itself precedes the evolution of X-specific condensins. In Rhabditina, X-specific condensins may have evolved in the presence of an existing mechanism linked to H4K20 methylation as Oscheius tipulae X chromosomes are enriched for H4K20me1 without SMC-4 duplication or TADs. In contrast, Steinernema hermaphroditum lacks H4K20me1 enrichment, SMC-4 duplication, and TADs.

However, the detection and quantification processes are noisy; in particular, peptides may be erroneously detected, and most peptides, known as shared peptides, are associated to multiple protein isoforms. As a consequence, studying individual protein isoforms is challenging, and inferred protein results are often abstracted to the gene-level or to groups of protein isoforms. Here, we introduce IsoBayes, a novel statistical method to perform inference at the isoform level. Our method enhances the information available, by integrating mass spectrometry proteomics and transcriptomics data in a Bayesian probabilistic framework. To account for the uncertainty in the measurement process, we propose a two-layer latent variable approach: first, we sample if a peptide has been correctly detected (or, alternatively filter peptides); second, we allocate the abundance of such selected peptides across the protein(s) they are compatible with. This enables us, starting from peptide-level data, to recover protein-level data; in particular, we: i) infer the presence/absence of each protein isoform (via a posterior probability), ii) estimate its abundance (and credible interval), and iii) target isoforms where transcript and protein relative abundances significantly differ. We benchmarked our approach in simulations, and in two multi-protease real datasets: our method displays good sensitivity and specificity when detecting protein isoforms, its estimated abundances highly correlate with the ground truth, and can detect changes between protein and transcript relative abundances.

This invasiveness persisted even after cells were removed from the crowded environment, a phenomenon mediated by mechanomemory. By combining genetic manipulations, mechanical modeling, and biophysical measurements, we revealed that the disaggregation of membrane domains-driven by a nanoscale smooth-corrugated topography transition of plasma membranes induced by Laplace pressure under crowded conditions-is essential for initiating cancer cell invasion.

To model this exosomal signaling, we developed a novel method to generate patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from breast tumor resections, uniquely preserving native tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) for the first time. This modifiable and reproducible system provides a robust platform for studying human tumor-immune interactions within the TME in vitro. After 3-day exosome treatment, we assessed the impact of T2D-derived exosomes on PDOs via single-cell RNA sequencing. Exosomes from T2D patient plasma triggered a 13.6-fold expansion of immunosuppressive TILs compared to non-diabetic exosome controls.

Tumor-intrinsic analysis revealed a 1.5-fold increase in intratumoral heterogeneity and approximately 2.3-fold upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, invasiveness, and cancer stemness, consistent with enhanced tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential of these PDOs. These findings demonstrate how metabolic dysregulation in T2D disrupts tumor-immune crosstalk, profoundly impairing anti-tumor immunity and driving cancer progression through a previously underappreciated exosomal signaling pathway. These insights into the TME could inform personalized treatments for patients with this comorbidity.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Upon binding to a target protein, this conformational diversity is reduced. However, ligands can retain some degree of conformational flexibility even when bound to a receptor. In the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a small number of ligands have been modeled with distinct alternative conformations that are supported by macromolecular X-ray crystallography density maps. However, the vast majority of structural models are fit to a single ligand conformation, potentially ignoring the underlying conformational heterogeneity present in the sample. We previously developed qFit-ligand to sample diverse ligand conformations and to select a parsimonious ensemble consistent with the density. While this approach indicated that many ligands populate alternative conformations, limitations in our sampling procedures often resulted in non-physical conformations and could not model complex ligands like macrocycles. Here, we introduce several improvements to qFit-ligand, including integrating RDKit for stochastic conformational sampling. This new sampling method greatly enriches low energy conformations of small molecules and macrocycles. We further extended qFit-ligand to identify alternative conformations in PanDDA-modified density maps from high throughput X-ray fragment screening experiments, as well as single-particle cryo- electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps. The new version of qFit-ligand improves fit to electron density and reduces torsional strain relative to deposited single conformer models and our prior version of qFit-ligand. These advances enhance the analysis of residual conformational heterogeneity present in ligand-bound structures, which can provide important insights for the rational design of therapeutic agents.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that the glomerular pathophysiology is associated with mRNA alternative splicing and polyadenylation of glomerular genes and of critical podocyte and slit diaphragm components that regulate the filtration barrier. Methods: Glomerular damage, accompanied by proteinuria, was induced by puromycin-aminonucleoside or adriamycin to mimic human minimal change disease or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), respectively, and RNA-seq analyses was performed. Alternatively spliced and alternatively polyadenylated events through differential exon and poly(A) site usage were queried in JunctionSeq and APATrap pipelines. These events were further mapped on podocyte and glomerular landscape, analyzed and modulated for slit diaphragm components, and cis- and trans-regulatory elements were identified. Results: Altered glomerular mRNA processing by alternative splicing/polyadenylation was identified in 136/71 and 1875/746 genes in minimal change disease and FSGS models, respectively. Transcript annotation and prioritization of significant alternative splicing and polyadenylation identified key events in several podocyte and slit diaphragm genes with novel and established roles. Alternative splicing of critical slit diaphragm components, the junction protein TJP1/ZO1 and microtubule associating protein ITM2B was further characterized. Alternative polyadenylation of core members of the slit diaphragm, NPHS1, NPHS2 and NEPH1 was analyzed with potential alteration of microRNA binding sites between the proximal vs distal poly (A) site usage in their mRNAs. Concomitantly, dysregulation of trans-regulatory elements (polyadenylation and splicing factors), was discovered in these models of nephropathies. Additionally, beneficial proteinuria-reducing treatments, pioglitazone and GQ16 reversed many alternatively spliced and polyadenylated events. Moreover, GWAS SNPs as potential cis-regulatory elements were identified in several genes from the human nephrotic syndrome database. Finally, we demonstrated proof-of-concept principle of chemically modified splice switching oligonucleotides in modulating TJP1 alternative splicing in podocytes. Conclusion: Findings from our studies identified that glomerular pathophysiology and disruption of the filtration barrier is associated with alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation of glomerular genes, many of which are crucial determinants of podocyte structure and function and the slit diaphragm complex.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Several different statistical approaches have been employed to investigate pathogenicity and susceptibility. Measures like proportional mortality or morbidity at a given time are attractive due to their simplicity but represent a single snapshot. Survival curve approaches, such as the Cox proportional hazards model and risk scores provide a more nuanced picture of the course of infection. More recently, Casadevall introduced the concept of pathogenic potential, a composite measure encompassing both host susceptibility and pathogen virulence, which focuses on the pathogenicity of a single pathogenic microbe, and later expanded to include additional nuances. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we conducted infection experiments with diverse species of Providencia bacteria that naturally vary in virulence. We also used several infectious doses to tune infections. We employed different host genotypes that vary in susceptibility to Providencia infection. Our analysis incorporates factors such as host genotype, pathogen type, inoculum load, symptomatic fraction, and mortality to compare host- and pathogen-based measures of pathogenicity. We discuss the advantages and limitations of each method, providing insights into their applicability in deciphering the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions and guiding the choice of analytical approaches in infectious disease research.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Most of the studies have estimated functional connectivity matrices as correlation coefficients between different brain areas, despite well-known disadvantages compared to partial correlation connectivity matrices. Indeed, partial correlation represents a more sensible model for structural connectivity since, under a Gaussian approximation, it accounts only for direct dependencies between brain areas. Motivated by this and following previous results by different authors, we investigate structure-function coupling using partial correlation matrices of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activity time series under various regularization (a.k.a. noise-cleaning) algorithms. We find that, across different algorithms and conditions, partial correlation provides a higher match with structural connectivity retrieved from Density Weighted Imaging data than standard correlation, and this occurs at both subject and population levels. Importantly, we also show that regularization and thresholding are crucial for this match to emerge. Finally, we assess neuro-genetic associations in relation to structure-function coupling, which presents promising opportunities to further advance research in the field of network neuroscience, particularly concerning brain disorders.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Speech production, one of the most complex motor behaviors, relies on a feedback control process to detect sensory errors and trigger updates in a feedforward control process that implements compensations. However, the specific contributions of these critical processes in sensorimotor learning during continuous vocal production remain debated. Here, we used two experimental designs in five experiments to dissociate these mechanisms. First, we employed a serial-dependence design with randomized pitch perturbations, dissociating the influences of sensory errors and motor compensation on subsequent vocalizations on a trial-by-trial basis. We found that motor compensation, rather than sensory errors, predicted the compensatory responses in the subsequent trials, suggesting instantaneous serial learning mediated by updates in the feedforward process. This compensation-driven serial learning was generalized across productions of different vowel categories. Second, we further implemented the experimental design in a sentential context, where auditory perturbation occurred only on the preceding syllable. Any learning effects in the subsequent syllable without pitch perturbation would reflect changes in the feedforward process. Our results consistently revealed that compensation in the preceding syllable predicted pitch changes in the subsequent syllable, but only when the two adjacent syllables were embedded within a word boundary. Collectively, the study provides ecological-valid evidence supporting that error-based motor compensation, incorporating cognitive and linguistic constraints, directly regulates the feedforward process and mediates the instantaneous serial learning in successive actions.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

In RA and pancreatic cancer IL-1{beta}+ macrophages express genes cooperatively induced by PGE2 and TNF signaling, but mechanisms that induce these cells and the extent to which they contribute to arthritic phenotypes are not known. In this study we used an integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis in primary human monocytes to study PGE2-TNF crosstalk, and how it is regulated by IFN-{gamma}, as occurs in RA synovial macrophages. We identified a TNF + PGE2 (TP) induced gene expression signature that is enriched in a previously identified IL1{beta}+ RA monocytic subset defined by scRNAseq and includes genes in pathogenic IL-1, Notch and neutrophil chemokine pathways. A similar TP gene expression signature was apparent in an IL-1{beta}+ macrophage subset newly identified by scRNAseq in ICI-arthritis. Reference mapping revealed that ICI-arthritis myeloid cells map primarily onto four previously defined RA synovial monocytic clusters, and the TP signature extends beyond IL-1{beta}+ cells to subsets of adjacent clusters, suggestive of a new functional monocyte subset. TP signature genes are distinct from canonical inflammatory NF-{kappa}B target genes such as TNF, IL6 and IL12B and are activated by cooperation of PGE2-induced AP-1, CEBP and NR4A family transcription factors with TNF-induced NF-{kappa}B activity. Unexpectedly, IFN-{gamma} suppressed induction of AP-1, CEBP and NR4A activity to ablate induction of IL-1, Notch and neutrophil chemokine genes, while promoting expression of distinct inflammatory genes such as TNF and T cell chemokines like CXCL10. The opposing cross-regulation of PGE2 and IFN signaling in vitro was reflected in vivo in mutually exclusive expression of TP and IFN signatures in different cell clusters in RA and ICI-arthritis monocytes. These results reveal the basis for synergistic induction of inflammatory genes by PGE2 and TNF, and a novel regulatory axis whereby IFN-{gamma} and PGE2 oppose each other to determine the balance between two distinct TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression programs relevant for RA and ICI-arthritis.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Synaptic signals generate fast dendritic spikes through two main modes of temporal summation: coincidence detection and integration. In coincidence detection, dendrites fire only when multiple incoming signals arrive in rapid succession, whereas integration involves summation of postsynaptic potentials over longer periods with minimal membrane leakage. This process is influenced by ionic properties, especially as the membrane potential approaches the firing threshold, where inactivating currents play a critical role. However, the modulation of temporal summation by these currents under in vivo-like conditions has not been thoroughly studied. In our research, we used computer simulations to investigate how three inactivating currents - A-type potassium, T-type calcium, and transient sodium - affect temporal summation. We found that calcium and sodium currents promote integrative behavior in dendrites, while potassium currents enhance their ability to act as coincidence detectors. By adjusting the levels of these currents in dendrites, neurons can flexibly switch between integration and coincidence detection modes, providing them with a versatile mechanism for complex tasks like multiplexing. This flexibility could be key to understanding how neural circuits process information in real time.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Despite sharing similar alpha diversity in MHC II supertypes, the hosts exhibited distinct beta diversity. We demonstrated MHC supertypes can predict Bd susceptibility better than individual MHC alleles, with some supertypes conferring protection and others increasing risk.

These slow dynamics modulate neuronal excitability, giving rise to brain state-specific synchronous oscillatory patterns across brain regions, which in turn could reflect local infra-slow variations in the extracellular potential. Such a relationship may provide new insights into the organisation of spontaneous brain dynamics beyond the established fast time scales. However, mapping of the LFP across brain regions with high spatio-temporal resolution remains challenging, with the infra-slow component particularly elusive. To overcome these limitations, we developed neural probes based on arrays of up to 512 multiplexed graphene transistors, which enable DC-coupled, high density, and large-scale recordings of surface and depth activity in freely behaving rats. Analysis of cortex-wide oscillation dynamics improves segmentation, provides new insights into global brain states and allows detection of the local oscillatory states. Brain state transitions related to changes in neuronal synchrony are found to correlate with topographically structured infra-slow dynamics. Furthermore, transregional infra-slow waves during non-REM sleep are globally coupled to diverse sleep spindle oscillatory modes independent of their localization while slow oscillations locally modulate spindles occurence.

Recently, studies using the mouse social-defeat stress model revealed a causal role for non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in the maladaptive behavioral responses to stress. These results suggest a novel function for NREM sleep; as a response by cortical neurons to mitigate the maladaptive effects of stress. A major limitation in many social defeat studies has been the exclusion of females. Women exhibit a greater prevalence of both affective disorders and sleep disturbances compared to men, thus there is a clear need to understand sleep - stress interactions in females. The present study adapts recently developed female social-defeat stress models to allow social-defeat and EEG in male - female pairs. Our findings duplicated the behavioral responses that occurred in other female, nondiscriminatory, and male models of social-defeat stress. Analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, before exposure to stress, revealed that susceptibility to the behavioral effects of stress was associated with increased post-defeat NREM sleep--exclusively in females. In males, increased NREM sleep after social defeat stress occurred only in resilient mice. A potential cause of these sleep differences was also identified prior to stress exposure; we identified sex differences in recovery from NREM-sleep loss, thus, suggesting a sex-difference in the homeostatic process regulating sleep. These contrasting responses reveal sexual dimorphism in both NREM sleep predicting resilience and NREM sleep changes induced by social-defeat stress. When considered in the context of existing human literature, these findings suggest that sex is a major factor influencing the interaction of sleep with maladaptive behavioral responses to stress.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have used the assumption that the linear momentum of the body center of mass (CoM) is controlled to analyze how gait is stabilized. In these studies, the position of the center of pressure (CoP) or of the foot relative to the COM is often used as an indicator of corrections of the CoM state. Mechanically, neither of these variables is directly related to changes in linear momentum, whereas they do directly affect whole-body angular momentum (WBAM), which has also been suggested to be a controlled variable. We show that, in human walking, linear and angular momentum follow quasi-periodic functions with similar periodicity and phase. Combining the equations of linear and rotational motion for a system of linked rigid segments shows that, in this case, the horizontal distance between CoP and CoM is a good predictor of horizontal forces in the corresponding direction. This suggests that linear and angular momentum are simultaneously controlled to follow similar quasi-periodic functions and may explain the success of preceding studies that correlated CoM states to CoP or foot locations. We developed feedback models to predict the ground reaction force and its moments along the sagittal and transverse axes from the preceding CoM state and WBAM respectively. These models were fitted to experimental data of participants walking at normal and slow speeds.

Various opsins have been tested in animal models of epilepsy, each contributing to our understanding of seizure circuit dynamics. However, inhibitory optogenetic tools based on microbial rhodopsins have low light sensitivity and, thus, are less suitable for applications involving larger brains. We evaluated eOPN3, a red-shifted, highly sensitive inhibitory G- protein coupled receptor opsin in a porcine seizure model using integrated electro-optical sensing and modulation. The results demonstrated the feasibility of eOPN3 circuit modulation in a large animal epilepsy model. Methods: MRI-guided stereotactic surgery was used to deliver 20-60 L of AAV_eOPN3 (AAV5/AAV9-CaMKII-eOPN3-mScarlet) into the hippocampus (HPC) of three Goottingen minipigs. Each hemisphere received either an active or a control viral vector (AAV5/9-CaMKII-mScarlet) with gadolinium to visualize the injection sites and diffusion volume via post-operative MRI. Two to three months post-injection, bilateral deep brain stimulation electrodes integrated with optic fibers were stereotactically implanted into the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) and HPC to assess: 1) opsin expression using fiber photometry, 2) optogenetic modulation of stimulation evoked response potentials (SERPs), 3) induction and propagation of seizure-like activity via intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) injection, and 4) optogenetic modulation of KA-induced seizure activity. After the electrophysiology recording, brains were harvested for histological analysis to evaluate injection target precision, eOPN3 expression, and estimate eOPN3-modulated volume. Results: eOPN3 expression was confirmed during surgery via fiber photometry. ANT electrical stimulation elicited robust SERPs in the HPCs, which were attenuated by HPC light illumination. HPC stimulation similarly induced SERPs in the ipsilateral ANT and the contralateral HPC. The HPC stimulation-induced SERPs were significantly reduced by illuminating the site of the recording areas, the ipsilateral ANT and the contralateral HPC, demonstrating the optogenetic inhibition of the synaptic release from the HPC. KA injection into the HPC induced 20-30 Hz seizure-like activity. The ANT and HPC light illumination suppressed the localized KA-induced seizure activity in the early stage. However, after the generalization of KA-induced seizures, the ANT-HPC illumination lost efficacy for the control of seizures. Histological analysis confirmed eOPN3 expression in the HPC, ANT and other Papez circuit nodes. Conclusion: Our pilot study highlights that eOPN3-mediated inhibition alters SERP and the latency and spread of KA-induced seizure-like activity. We developed a platform incorporating pre- and postoperative MRI for precise viral vector delivery, real-time fiber photometry for quantifying opsin expression, and integrated electro-optical sensing and stimulation to assess optogenetic efficacy in a large animal model.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic assessment of the literature on the non-steroid hormone factors involved in sperm binding and release from the sperm reservoir in animal species using in vitro experiments. PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched, and eligible studies included articles published between 1st January 1990 and 31st July 2024 reporting factors involved in sperm binding and release from the oviduct, and this could be used to optimize IVF systems and treatment of fertilization failure-related infertility. Studies that co-cultured sperm and oviductal explants or oviductal epithelial cells from bovine, porcine, canine, camelid, equine, hamster, and ovine were used, and different culture systems were evaluated in this study. Overall, sperm binding to and from the oviductal epithelial cells was influenced by several factors, such as carbohydrates and their derivatives, seminal plasma proteins, glycoproteins, tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm, endocannabinoids, sex-sorting, and glycosaminoglycans. These factors either promoted or inhibited the binding sperm binding to and from oviductal cells.

However, low water solubility, poor in vivo circulation stability and a lack of tumor specificity of many common PTAs limit their applicability. To address these issues, we have developed a simple, yet highly potent, tumor-targeted nanotheranostic system that consists of lipid/PEG-coated hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (LHAPNs) encapsulating the near-infrared (NIR) photothermal dye IR106 (LHAPNIRs). The lipid coat serves to retain the encapsulated dye and prevent serum protein adsorption and macrophage recognition, which would otherwise destabilize the nanoparticles and hinder their tumor targeting efficiency. Additionally, the coat is functionalized with the tumor-acidity-triggered rational membrane (ATRAM) peptide for efficient and specific internalization into tumor cells in the mildly acidic microenvironment of tumors. The nanoparticles facilitated real-time fluorescence and thermal imaging of tumors and demonstrated potent NIR-light triggered anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo, without adversely affecting healthy tissue, leading to markedly prolonged survival. Our results demonstrate that the biocompatible and biodegradable ATRAM-functionalized LHAPNIRs (ALHAPNIRs) effectively combine dual-mode diagnostic imaging with targeted cancer PTT.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

However, the exact interactions between the nanoparticles and immune cells as well as the mechanism involved are not known in detail.

The results showed inclusion of spikes mimicking virion structures on the surface increased cellular uptake and enhanced immune response as compared to spherical NPs. Proteomic analysis revealed that the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, Chemokine signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation pathways were involved in regulating the immune response when macrophages interacted with VLP. When the spikes increased from 5 to 30 nm, the expression levels of immune-related proteins including TRAF6 and PIAS4 proteins enhanced. This study revealed the interaction pathways and key proteins in the activation of immune response with VLP, which may provide insights to develop novel immunotherapy for enhanced efficacy.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

M.; Dagan, T.", "abstract": "Segmental duplications play an important role in genome evolution via their contribution to copy-number variation, gene-family diversification and the emergence of novel functions. The detection of segmental duplications is challenging due to heterogeneous amelioration of sequence similarity among duplicates, which hinders the reconstruction of continuous sequence alignment. Here we introduce SegMantX, a novel approach for the identifcation of diverged segmental duplications using local alignment chaining. In this approach, local alignments resulting from a preliminary sequence similarity search (e.g., BLASTn) are chained into continuous segments. Evaluating the performance of SegMantX simulated sequences shows that the tool can detect diverged duplications beyond the sensitivity limits of standard alignment-based methods. Applying SegMantX to 6,784 enterobacterial plasmids, we find that 74% plasmids contain duplicated regions, most of which correspond to duplicated mobile genetic elements (MGEs; e.g., transposons and insertion sequences). Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of SegMantX for the identification of diverged gene transfers between replicons, and plasmid hybridization events. Our findings highlight MGEs as drivers of segmental duplications in plasmid evolution, leading to the amplification of their cargo genes, including antibiotic resistance genes. SegMantX provides a powerful framework for reconstructing diverged segmental duplications and other alignment problems.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

However, MYC's transcriptional regulation remains incompletely understood. Our previous work demonstrated that key regulatory elements controlling Drosophila Myc reside within its 5' UTR and intergenic regions. In this study, we developed a highly sensitive and selective Solid Surface Magnetic Enrichment Protocol (SSMEP) to purify DNA-protein complexes formed on Myc cis-elements. Using analysis of truncated reporters, Electrophoretic-Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA), and mass spectrometric protein identification, we identified a cis-regulatory module (CRM) within the proximal 5' UTR that appears sufficient to activate lacZ reporter expression in the ovary and embryos. Furthermore, combining CRMs from either the upstream region or the intergenic Downstream Promoter Element (DPE) region with the proximal 5' UTR regulatory unit recapitulates expression patterns previously observed in larval tissues, ovaries, and embryos. The DPE itself exhibits promoter activity when fused in-frame to an adjacent binding site cluster, and drives expression mimicking that of wild-type Myc. Further in vivo validation is necessary to confirm the functional relevance of the associated factors and identified signaling cascades as Myc regulators.

Using norbornene-modified hyaluronic acid (NorHA) hydrogels with tunable stiffness (190-884 Pa), we investigated how hydrogel stiffness influences cell morphology, endothelial maturation, mechanotransduction, and microvascular network formation in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial progenitors (hiPSC-EPs). Our findings reveal a stiffness-dependent tradeoff between mechanotransduction and vascular network formation. At intermediate stiffness (551 Pa), cells exhibited the greatest increase in endothelial marker CD31 expression and Yes-associated protein (YAP)/ transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) nuclear translocation, indicating enhanced mechanotransduction and endothelial maturation. However, this did not translate to superior plexus formation. Instead, the most compliant matrix (190 Pa) supported greater vascular connectivity, characterized by longer branches (~0.03/volume vs. 0.015 at 551 Pa) and enhanced actin remodeling. 3D cell contraction measurements revealed a 15.6-fold higher basal displacement in compliant hydrogels, suggesting that cell-generated forces and matrix deformability collectively drive vascular morphogenesis. Unlike prior studies focusing on pathological stiffness ranges (>10 kPa), our results emphasize that vascularization is not solely driven by the most mechanotransductive environment but rather by a balance of compliance, contractility, and cell-induced remodeling. These findings underscore the need to design hydrogels that provide sufficient mechanotransduction for endothelial maturation while maintaining compliance to support dynamic vascular morphogenesis.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to identify loci associated with drought stress, tree physiology, growth or wood quality traits, which could be prioritized in breeding programs. Genotypic and phenotypic data were collected from approximately 100 adult beech trees per stand in five locations in the South-Eastern Romanian Carpathians along an altitudinal gradient associated with precipitation and temperature. We performed GWAS using PLINK to identify SNP markers associated with traits related to drought stress. A total of 121 markers on eight chromosomes were identified as being associated with stomatal density. Sixty-four markers are located on chromosome 10 in a region spreading from ~4.89 to 13.67 Mb. There are five genes in this region that are thought to play a role in controlling stomatal density. All markers within this region exhibit similar allele frequencies, which are correlated with stomatal density and the altitudinal gradient of the stands.

GEF1 promotes GTP exchange on Rac1 and RhoG, while GEF2 activates RhoA. Although GEF1 and GEF2 share a common architecture, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in TRIO GEF1 (PH1) assists its activity, while the PH domain in GEF2 (PH2) inhibits its activation of RhoA. A series of single point variants in the unique {beta}3-{beta}4 loop of TRIO PH2 has been identified in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but how they impact TRIO GEF2 activity is not known.

GEF2 expression in N2A cells significantly reduces neurite outgrowth, and expression of the G2211E activating GEF2 variant enhances this effect.

The molecular identities of interoceptors, and the functional consequences of chemosensation by specific interoceptive neurons remain to be fully described. The C. elegans pharyngeal neuronal network is anatomically and functionally homologous to the mammalian enteric nervous system. Here, we show that the I3 pharyngeal enteric neuron responds to cations via an I3-specific variant ionotropic receptor (IR) to regulate salt stress tolerance. The GLR-9 IR, located at the gut lumen-exposed sensory end of I3, is necessary and sufficient for salt sensation, establishing a chemosensory function for IRs beyond insects. Salt detection by I3 protects specifically against high salt stress, as glr-9 mutants show reduced tolerance of hypertonic salt but not sugar solutions, with or without prior acclimation. While cholinergic signaling from I3 promotes tolerance to acute high salt stress, peptidergic signaling from I3 during acclimation is essential for resistance to a subsequent high salt challenge. Transcriptomic analyses show that I3 regulates salt tolerance in part via regulating the expression of osmotic stress response genes in distal tissues.

First, we identified two aberrant brain states that predominantly overlapped with the somatomotor and default mode networks, respectively.

M. I.; Smits, H. M.; van der Wal, M.; Dekkers, C.; Boesjes, C. M.; Drylewicz, J.; de Bruin-Weller, M.; van Wijk, F.", "abstract": "Background: Biologic therapies, such as the IL-4 receptor alpha blocker dupilumab, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors like upadacitinib, have revolutionized the management of atopic dermatitis (AD). However, prolonged treatment is necessary to sustain disease remission. While both therapies are clinically effective, only dupilumab has demonstrated successful dose reduction, suggesting potential disease-modifying effects. This study investigates the immune-modulating potential of one year treatment with dupilumab or upadacitinib in AD by assessing epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in skin-homing T cells. Methods: Using flow cytometry, CD4+CLA+ T cells were isolated from AD patients (n=12) at baseline and after 52 weeks of dupilumab (n=6) or upadacitinib (n=6) treatment. DNA methylome, RNA transcriptome and cytokines expression analyses were conducted using the EPIC array, RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, respectively. Non-atopic healthy controls (HC) (n=6) were included for comparison. Results: We identified 747 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between HC and AD patients (p-value < 0.1), with a predominance of hypomethylation in AD. These DMR-associated genes were enriched in pathways such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and JAK-STAT signaling. Several DMRs were associated with corresponding changes in the transcriptome and significant differential methylation was observed near 11 AD-associated SNPs. Following treatment, dupilumab partially corrected 6 AD-related DMRs towards the HC profile. Conversely, upadacitinib modulated 40 AD-related DMRs, most shifting further towards the AD profile. Intriguingly, 241 DMRs (upadacitinib) and 13 DMRs (dupilumab) were altered independently of AD-related DMRs, suggesting a broader epigenetic impact of upadacitinib. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate distinct epigenetic effects of dupilumab and upadacitinib in skin-homing T cells from AD patients. The direction and extent of these modifications may contribute to differences in long-term disease control and have clinical implications for therapy discontinuation strategies.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

R.; Koelle, K.", "abstract": "For a number of viral pathogens, prolonged infections have been hypothesized to be the source of new variants that emerge and spread at the level of the host population. This potential role of prolonged infections has been highlighted most recently in the context of SARS-CoV-2, with variants of concern Alpha and Omicron likely to have evolved in immunocompromised individuals experiencing long-term viral infections. Analyses of sequenced viral samples from prolonged infections have indicated that there are several consistent patterns of evolution observed across these infections. These patterns include accelerated rates of nonsynonymous substitution, viral genetic diversification into distinct lineages, parallel substitutions across infected individuals, and heterogeneity in rates of antigenic evolution. Here, we use within-host model simulations to explore the drivers of these evolutionary patterns. Our simulations build on a tunably rugged fitness landscape model to first assess the role that mutations that impact only viral replicative fitness have in driving these patterns. They then further incorporate pleiotropic sites that jointly impact replicative fitness and antigenicity to assess the role that immune pressure has on these patterns. Through simulation, we find that the empirically observed patterns of viral evolution in prolonged infections cannot be robustly explained by viral populations evolving on replicative fitness landscapes alone. Instead, we find that immune pressure is needed to consistently reproduce the observed patterns. While our simulation models were designed to shed light on drivers of viral evolution in prolonged infections with respiratory viruses that generally cause acute infection, their structure can be used to better understand viral evolution in other acutely-infecting viruses such as noroviruses that can cause prolonged infection as well as viruses such as HIV that are known to chronically infect.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Through whole blood and immune cell-sorted bulk RNA sequencing, we identified immune signatures specific to cutaneous subtypes of SLE. Subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE) exhibited broad upregulation of type I interferon, TNF-, and IL6-JAK-STAT3, pathways suggesting potential unique therapeutic responses to JAK and type I interferon inhibition. While interferon signaling is prominent in SCLE, discoid lupus, and acute lupus, it is unexpectedly absent in patients with skin and mucosal ulcers. Pathway and cell-type enrichment analysis revealed unexpected roles for CD14+ monocytes in photosensitivity of SLE and NK cells in alopecia, mucosal ulceration, and livedo reticularis.

However, as bacteria populations differ in their susceptibility to phages and antibiotics, the strains selected may not represent how the infecting population will respond to treatment. Our aim was to assess whether the effects of phage on single or a mix of isolates in vitro show more comparable results to that observed during a clinical case study. Methods and Results The patient presented with a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (MRSA). In this previously published case study, phage therapy alongside antibiotics rapidly cleared blood cultures of bacteria while localised regions, including the lungs, took longer to clear of bacteria. In this follow-up study, mixed isolates were more likely to persist than single isolates in vitro, more closely representing the lung, but not blood, infections. These results may reflect the different degrees of genetic diversity of the infecting bacteria in these sites. Conclusions For this patient, phage therapy predictions were significantly affected by whether we used mixed versus single isolates, but the predictive precision depended on the site of in vivo infection.

Here, we presented a new hybrid dataset of phonological and morpho-syntactic features from languages sampled across the GQ region.

Our results showed that GQ languages have distinct contact patterns in their phonological and morphosyntactic systems, with some languages exhibiting clear evidence of mixture. Using a new statistical method, Trait Sharing Test (TS-TEST), based on tree topology, we identified significant influences from Sinitic, Tibetan, Mongolic, and Turkic languages in shaping GQ linguistic diversity.

In dichotomously branching plants, such as many bryophytes and lycophytes, new meristems are formed when a pre-existing meristem splits into two daughter meristems. These meristems may be active and produce shoot branches or may be inactive. Here, we show that in conditions where meristem inactivation occurs, such as simulated shade, the position of the inactive meristem alternated between either side of the plant body in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. Using this predictable pattern, we generated transcriptomes of active and inactive meristems and identified the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, MpCYP78E1, as a novel regulator of meristem activity. MpCYP78E1 reporter expression was higher in active meristems than inactive meristems. More meristems were active in loss of function mutants than wild type, and fewer meristems were active in gain of function mutants, indicating that MpCYP78E1 inhibits meristem activity. Furthermore, unlike wild type, Mpcyp78e1 loss of function mutants produced supernumerary meristem from the centre of the mature plant body. We conclude that MpCYP78E1 inhibits both meristem initiation and activity to modulate shoot branching architecture.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

However, the structural components of spermatozoid cilia in the land plants are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated MpCAFA (combined CAPS and FAP115; Mp1g04120) in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. The N-terminal and near C-terminal regions of MpCAFA show similarity to calcyphosine (CAPS), a mammalian EF-hand protein, and to FAP115, a ciliary protein of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, respectively. MpCAFA is expressed specifically in antheridia, and its orthologs are found in some algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes and cycads, but not in most of seed plants. Spermatozoids of mutants that lack functional MpCAFA exhibited significant decrease in swimming speed. Notably, these mutants showed no obvious morphological defect, including the 9+2 axoneme arrangement, and retained chemotactic capability and fertility, forming normal spores. This suggests that MpCAFA is required for spermatozoid motility but not for sperm chemotaxis or subsequent reproductive processes. Introduction of MpCAFApro:MpCAFA-mCitrine fully complemented the mutant phenotype and revealed MpCAFA-mCitrine was localized along the entire length of the two spermatozoid cilia. Both the CAPS-like and FAP115-like regions were essential for MpCAFA function and subcellular localization in spermatozoid, whereas the C-terminal proline-rich region was dispensable. These findings indicate that MpCAFA is a major ciliary protein in land plants and can serve as a marker to visualize spermatozoid ciliary movement.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

In this study, we introduce RBPP in plants by identifying over 15,000 labelling sites in native protein extracts from Arabidopsis cell cultures using an amine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester probe linked to biotin. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by examining differential labelling in the Arabidopsis proteome in response to ATP. Pre-treatment with ATP results in decreased biotin-NHS labelling at residues near known ATP-binding sites and also revealed several novel ATP-responsive proteins. Lastly, we established RBPP with phosphonic acid-based NHS probes and immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment, revealing over 5,700 additional labelling sites.

Naturally occurring loss-of-function (LoF) mutations provide a valuable perspective on gene dispensability, offering insights into deleterious and adaptive gene loss. In this study, we identified 91,751 naturally occurring LoF variants from publicly available Arabidopsis genome data. Our findings demonstrate that LoF-intolerant genes are enriched in essential biological functions and associated with specific histone marks linked to active transcription. In contrast, LoF-tolerant genes exhibit relaxed selective pressure and are enriched in functions related to pollen rejection and defense responses, and can be used as a proxy for dispensable genes in the pan-genome. Using a random forest model trained on histone marks, we achieved moderate success in predicting gene LoF tolerance, with an AUC of 0.717 in Arabidopsis and 0.768 in rice, and even across species. We also pioneered genome-wide LoF burden tests in Arabidopsis, collapsing independent LoF alleles into a single state to reduce allelic heterogeneity. By integrating LoF burden tests with transcriptomic data, we identified thousands of LoF-expression associations. Notably, this analysis accurately recapitulated the flowering time networks and identified FRIGIDA as a key regulator of flowering time genes.

In line with these findings, short-term intranasal administration of pEVs significantly increased cell proliferation in the DG. Long-term (28-day) pEVs treatment further elevated the proportion of newborn mature neurons in the DG, whereas HPPL primarily increased both proliferation and the number of immature neurons.

Methods: HIF-1 was over-expressed by using a lentiviral vector, and transduced steadily in Wistar rats bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Real-time quantitative and western blot were performed to assess the expression level of HIF-1. Then, HIF-1/BMSCs were cultured to form osteogenic cell sheets(OCTs). ALP activity and Alizarin-red staining were performed respectively at day 14 and 21 to detect the characteristic of osteogenesis. Simultaneously, HIF-1/BMSCs were induced to differentiate into endothelial-like cells(iECs) for 14 days, and flow cytometry was further detected the conversion rates of HIF-1/BMSCs to iECs. Finally, iECs were seeded onto the OCTs to construct the prevascularized-osteogenic cell sheets (P-OCTs). In order to detect the role of HIF-1 involved in osteogenic-angiogenic coupling response of P-OCTs, Immunofluorescent staining for CD31 was performed on P-OCTs at 1, 3, 7, 14 days to check the formation of networks, and western blot of osteopontin(OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) at 1, 7, 14 days to detect bone formation. Meanwhile, the none transduced BMSCs were as control. Conclusion: BMSCs were transduced by Lenti-HIF-1 with optimal multiplicity of infection was 30 (MOI=30), meanwhile, qPCR and western blot were performed to confirm this result. Next, the flow cytometric analysis results showed the conversion rate of BMSCs differentiated to iECs was 92.43%, which indicated BMSCs transduced by HIF-1 had a great superiority to differentiate into endothelial cells under experimental conditions. Then, ALP at day 14 and Alizarin-red staining at day 21 on OCTs showed an obvious osteogenic differentiation characteristic with more deep stained calcium nodules deposits than the control groups. Finally, we fabricated P-OCTs and observed iECs migrated reticulated fast and formed a large number of lumens and networks in experimental groups. At the same time, the results of Immunofluorescent staining for CD31 at day 1, 3, 7, 14 and osteogenic proteins expressions of OCN,OPN at day 1, 7, 14 showed that HIF-1 could promote osteogenic-angiogenic coupling response in P-OCTs significantly in vitro. All in all, the over-expressed HIF-1 of BMSCs cell sheets strategy can provide a new promising method for bone engineering, and we will detect further in vivo.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

However, these methods typically predict only a single conformation, while accurately predicting multiple conformations, which are essential for the functions and regulations of many protein classes, remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that AlphaFold2 has internal knowledge of alternative protein conformations, which can be effectively extracted by learning modifications to its intermediate hidden states using a negative entropy loss. Our resulting method, Entropy Guided Fold (EGF), achieves a success rate of over 80% in accurately predicting two conformations of 37 tested membrane proteins within a 2.0 angstrom RMSD threshold, with similar performance for proteins both within and outside AlphaFold2's training dataset. In addition, our method successfully reveals three or more conformational states in several cases. We have also developed a post-processing strategy to effectively select accurate predictions. Overall, our method provides an efficient and robust approach for predicting multiple conformations of target proteins, with broad potential applications in mechanistic studies and translational applications.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Among the two allopolyploid cultivated species of cotton, Gossypium barbadense is known for its superior quality fiber compared to G. hirsutum. Length and strength are key determinants of the fiber quality. Although the mature fibers are dried cell walls consisting mainly cellulose, the dynamic remodeling of pectin, xyloglucan, and xylan polysaccharides during fiber growth significantly impact the final fiber quality. Comprehensive knowledge about polysaccharides and their biosynthesis during fiber development of the cultivated species is important for improving fiber quality. In this study, comparative large-scale glycome, transcriptome and proteome profiling were conducted daily on fibers of both cotton species covering critical stages of fiber development spanning primary cell wall synthesis and the transition to secondary wall synthesis. Interspecific comparisons revealed that a delayed accumulation of cellulose content, as well as the occurrence of lower levels and differential compositions of non-fucosylated/fucosylated xyloglucans, homogalacturonans, and highly branched Rhamnogalacturonan-I polysaccharides might be contributing to longer fiber phenotypes of G. barbadense relative to G. hirsutum. Our study also suggests, differential temporal compositions of heteroxylans might contribute to variation in cellulose microfibril arrangement and strength of fiber exists between the two species of cotton. Comparative transcriptomic analysis identified differentially expressed polysaccharide-synthesizing glycosyltransferases that might underlie fiber quality differences between the two species. Transcripts encoding many cell wall localized expansins were more abundant in G. barbadense than in G. hirsutum. Overall, these findings extend our knowledge regarding the molecular factors that contribute to fiber quality and provide insights for targeted cotton fiber improvement.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

For that, the brain needs to continuously integrate sensory information and convert it into corrective motor commands. Although this entire process naturally hinges on the reliability of early senses, very few studies have investigated early sensory acuity and its role in postural stability during development. Clarifying this could lead to a better understanding of conditions, such as developmental coordination disorder (DCD), where the impairment of balance control is substantial. Here, we tested 25 typically developed school-aged children with a Visual Motion Detection test (VMDT), an ankle Joint Position Sense test (aJPST), force-plate assessed posturography, and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - Second edition (MABC-2). We found a significant correlation between the balance score of the MABC-2 and both VMDT score (r = 0.60, p = 0.003) and aJPST score (r = -0.47, p = 0.02). However, no such relationship was found between the force-plate assessed sway amplitude during upright standing and the two sensory acuity scores. Importantly, the MABC-2 balance scores were associated with upright stability, but only to a limited extent. Given that the MABC-2 balance component factors in static and dynamic balance while posturography focuses only on static balance, our results point at a key role of early sensory acuity for dynamic balance. Together, these findings bring attention to possible clinical tools for motor impairment detection and subsequent rehabilitation strategies during development.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Objective: We sought to obtain nasal transcriptomic data from hospitalized children with respiratory viral infections. Methods: We obtained nasal swabs from 46 children with RV (16 RV-A, 30 RV-C). For comparison, we examined swabs from 12 children with RSV and six controls. Subjects ranged in age from 1 month to 18 years. Viral detection, genotyping and copy number were determined by PCR. RNA transcripts were measured by next generation sequencing and differences in gene expression calculated using DESeq2. Results: Compared to controls, 1232 transcripts were upregulated (adjusted p<0.05, fold change >1.5) by all three viruses, including genes regulating granulocyte chemotaxis, cysteinyl leukotriene production, epithelial remodeling and antiviral responses. Cilium-related genes were downregulated. Compared to RSV, RV induced greater expression of 207 genes including those regulating eosinophilic inflammation, mucus secretion and mast cell function. RSV induced greater upregulation of 674 genes including those regulating neutrophilic inflammation and type 1 IFN response. Computational deconvolution of RNA-seq profiles revealed that viral infection decreased ciliated cells while increasing neutrophils, natural killer cells, monocytes (all viral species) and goblet cells (RV only). RV-C infections increased mast cells and IFN-{lambda} mRNA expression. RV copy number correlated with the expression of mast cell proteases and numerous pro-inflammatory and IFN-stimulated genes. Conclusion: Children hospitalized with RV and RSV infections mount robust inflammatory responses, but virus-specific differences exist.

Unfortunately, T cell activation in dogs for optimal viral transduction has not been determined, restricting advancements in canine T cell immunotherapy. Two CD3 and two CD28 antibody clones for canine T cell stimulation have been described in the literature, but no studies have been undertaken to evaluate which CD3/CD28 combination is most effective, nor has anyone directly compared the efficacy of the two most popular antibody presentation strategies: antibody-coated plates and antibody-conjugated beads. In evaluating the effects of plate- or bead-bound CD3 stimulation alone versus CD3/CD28 in combination, we tested 12 possible antibody stimulation strategies in addition to evaluating two largely unexplored mitogens in canine T cell transduction, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) with ionomycin and concanavalin A (ConA). We investigated the impact of these stimulation strategies on canine T cell activation, expansion, and transduction. For stimulation strategies producing the best results, we also examined how each strategy affected the proportions of CD4/CD8 T cell subsets and regulatory T cell (Treg) prevalence. We determined that, in general, plate-bound antibodies were far superior to bead-bound antibodies for canine T cell stimulation, and that plate-bound CD3 clone CA17.6F9 in combination with CD28 clone 5B8 or the mitogen PMA with ionomycin produced better activation and expansion profiles, better transduction, and more desirable T cell subsets that are more likely to improve patient outcomes in dogs suffering from round cell and solid tumors.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

This study uses metagenomic and culture-based approaches to investigate pathogen genotypes and stool microbiome composition. Stool samples from three patients were analysed using culture, qPCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS) of genomes and metagenomes. Strain typing and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling were conducted for both pathogens. The stool microbiome structure was compared between the three patients and across three time points in one patient. C. jejuni and Salmonella enterica were of different strains and different proportions in the cases. C. jejuni sequence types were identified as ST-794, ST-50 and ST-10025, while S. enterica serovars Enteritidis ST-183 and S. Derby ST-39 were identified. C. jejuni AMR genotypes included blaOXA-447, gyrA (T86I), and tet(O). S. Enteritidis contained AMR gene mdsaA-B, and S. Derby contained mdsaA-B and fosA7 genes. Despite similarities in Bristol scales for stool composition, the three cases exhibited distinct microbiome population structures, suggesting there is no one signature microbial profile of microbiomes with a Campylobacter-Salmonella co-infection. A temporal trend towards microbial diversity was observed within a patient, shifting from Proteobacteria dominance (93.3%) during acute infection towards Bacteroidetes (89.5%) abundance post-infection, suggesting that moving towards diverse communities may play a key role in patient recovery.

Using an automated identification system, we recorded nest attendance and quantified coordination levels through the {varphi} coefficient. Our analysis revealed that higher coordination levels were associated with reduced extended nest absence periods, potentially decreasing prolonged chick fasting. However, coordination levels showed no significant direct effect on chick growth rates, while regular provisioning frequency, which can be associated with the coordination, and meal size emerged as critical determinants of chick development.

To understand how urban landscape heterogeneity shapes the movements of an iconic urban animal, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), we investigated the factors influencing rat genetic connectivity across Manhattan, New York City. We generated genome-wide SNP data from rats sampled throughout Manhattan as well as paired surface-subway locations, created a habitat suitability model using systematic municipal rat survey data, and employed landscape genetic approaches to identify urban features influencing rat gene flow. Our models revealed that underground subway tunnels were the strongest facilitator of rat gene flow, with municipal zoning also strongly influencing connectivity, particularly through low / medium-density residential areas. Habitat suitability analysis showed that high human population density, old building ages, and lower median household income were the strongest predictors of rat presence. Subterranean sampling revealed that rats in subway stations exhibited greater genetic relatedness than surface rats at short distances but lower inbreeding coefficients, suggesting underground tunnels facilitate longer-distance dispersal while maintaining some connectivity to surface populations. These findings demonstrate that physical infrastructure, political, and socioeconomic factors shape urban rat ecology, with implications for more targeted approaches to pest management in complex urban environments.

However, host-microbe dynamics on evolutionary time scales remain under-characterized. We studied Drosophila melanogaster experimentally evolved under three nutrient regimes: constant high (CH), deteriorating (DA), and fluctuating (FA) availability, alongside unselected controls (C). DA and FA increased longevity relative to CH, with DA enhancing late-life survival, though all selected groups showed higher mortality than C, suggesting fitness costs of dietary adaptation. Sex-specific effects emerged, with FA favoring early-life female survival and DA supporting late-life female longevity. Microbial richness and composition shifted with selection and time. While Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominated generally, selection regimes showed higher Firmicute and lower Proteobacteria abundances compared to C, correlating with dysbiotic microbiomes starting early in adulthood. DA flies maintained a relatively stable microbial diversity over time, potentially supporting longevity. In contrast, CH and FA both exhibited low microbial diversity that destabilized with age. Indicator species analysis revealed treatment- and age-specific genera, with CH and FA showing greater dysbiosis, marked by potentially pathogenic taxa such as Leptotrichia and Mobiluncus.

They are also utilized in anti-malarial drug therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) to differentiate recrudescent parasites from new infections. However, these polymorphic genes are usually under selection. Therefore, neutral microsatellite markers are preferred as they are also easier to genotype. The current study investigated the genetic diversity and COI using the poly- microsatellite marker to provide background information on circulating genotypes before its applied to TES in Kenya. Methodology: Dried blood spot (DBS) samples were obtained from 93 participants from a TES in Busia County in 2016 and 92 participants from a malaria monitoring study conducted in Kilifi in 2020. Genotyping of the poly- microsatellite was done by PCR, capillary electrophoresis and the fragment data analyzed using GeneMarker. Results: About 96.7% and 87% of the samples from Busia and Kilifi, respectively, were successfully genotyped. The infections in Busia were mainly polyclonal (80%) with a significantly higher mean COI of 2.9 (p < 0.0001), while those in Kilifi were mostly monoclonal (52.5%) with a mean COI of 1.7. Despite on average a younger population and lower parasite density, both regions had similar expected heterozygosity (He) (Busia = 0.92; Kilifi = 0.90) while Busia recorded a slightly higher number of effective alleles (Ne) (Busia = 10.8; Kilifi = 9.3).

However, a key challenge remain: conventional, behavioral perceptual training - typically based on response accuracy feedback - is limited in improving sensitivity to small, subtle errors. While prior approaches have focused on modulating sensory regions to enhance perceptual learning, we propose an alternative approach: targeting a cognitive neural marker, namely the error positivity (Pe), a component of the error-related potential (ErrP) that primarily originates in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a key region involved in decision-making. We hypothesize that the Pe, which reflects conscious awareness of errors, serves as a modifiable neural correlate of error perception. To address the performance bottlenecks seen in conventional, behavioral perceptual training, we show that real-time feedback on ErrP presence or absence during perceptual training over five longitudinal days enhances the Pe component and improves participants' ability to detect small visuo-motor errors - an outcome not achieved through conventional, behavioral perceptual training. These findings offer new neurophysiological insights into error perception and learning, and establish ErrP-based BCI interventions as a promising tool for accelerating perceptual learning, particularly in contexts where subtle error detection is critical.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

We are interested in the related tasks of (i) inferring predictive sequence-to-function maps and (ii) decomposing sequence-function maps to elucidate the contributions of individual subsequences. Because each sequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in multiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires \"gauge-fixing,\" i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent work has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as the unique solutions to$L_2-regularized regression in an overparameterized \"weight space'\" where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we establish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized weight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in \"function space,'' i.e. the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of sequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit prior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular gauge. We also show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary explicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges. Next, we derive the distribution of gauge-fixed weights implied by the Gaussian process posterior and demonstrate that even for long sequences this distribution can be efficiently computed for product-kernel priors using a kernel trick. Finally, we characterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common weight space regularizers.

The current gold standard for diagnosing GC, upper endoscopy, is invasive and has limited sensitivity for detecting gastric preneoplasia such as dysplasia. Non-invasive biomarkers, such as circulating proteins in the blood, hold promise for the early detection of asymptomatic gastric lesions. Methods: During an exploratory study, plasma samples from 39 participants, including patients diagnosed with different gastric pathologies (gastritis, preneoplasia, GC) and healthy controls, were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD062315. Differentially abundant proteins were identified through pairwise comparisons and sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sparse PLS-DA). Fifteen candidate proteins were selected and quantified by ELISA in plasma samples from the full cohort of 138 participants. Results: Proteomic profiling identified 691 proteins in plasma samples. Pairwise comparisons highlighted up to 213 candidate biomarkers capable of distinguishing cancer patients from healthy controls, while distinguishing gastritis and preneoplasia proved challenging due to their similar proteomic profiles. Sparse PLS-DA identified 85 proteins that distinguish all patient groups. Subsequent ELISA validation confirmed Leptin as a promising biomarker for detecting gastric preneoplasia, particularly in women. Additionally, nine additional proteins (ATAD3B, IGFALS, JUP, LBP, MAN2A1, ARG1, CA2, HPT, KRT14) showed differential plasma levels across patients groups, with variations influenced by age and gender. Multi-biomarker prediction models incorporating factors such as age, gender, and H. pylori status, outperformed single-protein models. Using 4-fold cross-validation repeated 10 times, the top-performing models achieved high predictive accuracy, with mean AUROC values of 85.3% for classifications cancer vs. non-cancer and 83.9% for cancer/preneoplasia vs. healthy/gastritis. On the full cohort, optimal biomarker combinations reached AUROC values exceeding 94% for these classifications. Conclusions: This study introduces a novel, non-invasive approach for predicting GC based on plasma protein concentrations across a broad spectrum of gastric pathologies. Predictive models, validated through robust cross-validation, demonstrated high accuracy using a limited panel of biomarkers. Leveraging simple blood sampling, this strategy holds promise for high-risk gastric mucosal lesions, including at asymptomatic stages.

The ERBB3high stem-like tumor cell subpopulation reflects the intrinsic PN heterogeneity and can serve as alternative druggable targets. Characterization using molecular signatures also reveals the heterogeneity within the PN cell lines, and the PN drug screen analysis proposes that SNX-2112, an HSP90 inhibitor, can inhibit PN cell viability by targeting ERBB3-associated signaling. Our in vitro results demonstrated a significant viability reduction in ERBB3high PN cells compared to the controls. Treatment with SNX-2112 led to a decrease in total ERBB3, p-ERBB3 (Tyr1289), and the downstream total AKT and p-AKT (Ser473) levels. Furthermore, the significant in vivo inhibitory efficacy of SNX-2112 was revealed using a transplantation model from mouse PN with DhhCreNF1f/f;Luc configuration. These findings support the efficacy of SNX-2112 as a potential alternative therapeutic strategy, highlighting its possible application in PN patients.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Most decisions are carried out under conditions of uncertainty, where the desired outcome may not be achieved if the wrong decision is made. In these cases, humans deliberate before making a choice. The neural dynamics underlying deliberation are unknown and intracranial recordings in clinical settings present a unique opportunity to record high temporal resolution electrophysiological data from many (hundreds) brain locations during behavior. Combined with dynamic systems modeling, these allow identification of latent brain states that describe the neural dynamics during decision-making, providing insight into these neural dynamics and computations. Results show that the neural dynamics underlying risky decision, but not decisions without risk, converge to separate subspaces depending on the subject's preferred choice and that the degree of overlap between these subspaces declines as choice approaches, suggesting a network level representation of evidence accumulation. These results bridge the gap between regression analyses and data driven models of latent states and suggest that during risky decisions, deliberation and evidence accumulation toward a final decision are represented by the same neural dynamics, providing novel insights into the neural computations underlying human choice.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

In this work, the cancer studies of the CPTAC, TCGA, and GTEx projects were targeted using a thorough database mining technique. Several analytical methods were used to examine full-scale molecular, expression, and prognostic profiles of the KCNN4 gene in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues. It was discovered that the majority of the cancerous tissue had different levels of mRNA and protein expression for this gene. The results of comparative immunohistochemistry also revealed that normal pancreatic tissues had reduced expression of the KCNN4 protein. An analysis overview of copy-number alterations and KCNN4 mutations in PAAD samples was also conducted. Furthermore, there was a correlation found between the expression of KCNN4 and both overall and disease-free survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue, co-expressed genes of KCNN4 were found to be involved in cell maintenance-related functions, according to gene coexpression, additional ontology, and pathway analysis. When it comes to cancer diagnosis and treatment, the experimental findings of this study should aid in integrating KCNN4 into clinical applications.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis by targeting CAV1 specifically in the liver (L.Cav1-/- mice) improves energy and glucose metabolism in diabetic mice. Here we show that the absence of hepatic CAV1 increases insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and decreases fasting hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in mice feeding a high fat high sucrose diet (HFHS diet). The decrease in insulin sensitivity takes place also in L.Cav1-/- mice feeding a standard diet (STD diet). Moreover, we demonstrated an improvement of glycemic control when hepatic Cav1 is deleted in previously prediabetic mice. In parallel, the absence of CAV1 in the liver reduces body weight gain and lipid intestinal absorption.

Motivated by our observation that cellular adaptation dynamics are approximately scale-free, we built a theoretical framework for bacterial growth control with dynamic power-law memory to explain how bacteria integrate environmental information over a range of timescales to enable growth rate adaptation. We show how this behavior arises naturally from heterogeneous ribosomal relaxation dynamics within a bacterial cell. Using this model, we identify an inherent tradeoff between growth rate maximization and adaptation speed, which we validate experimentally in pulsatile nutrient environments.

The serotonergic psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early clinical studies, yet its mechanisms and efficacy remain poorly characterized in established models of depression. Here, we evaluated the effects of a single dose of DMT in the Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (UCMS) paradigm, a robust mouse model recapitulating key features of MDD, including anhedonia and cognitive impairment. DMT administered after UCMS reversed depressive-like behavior and restored cognitive performance, outperforming chronic fluoxetine across most domains. When administered during the stress period, DMT prevented the development of anhedonia but did not rescue cognitive deficits, suggesting partial protection. Notably, DMT remained effective under isoflurane anesthesia, indicating that its therapeutic action can occur independently of the psychedelic experience. Histological analyses revealed that all DMT regimes significantly increased adult-born granule cell (abGC) integration and reduced the number of ectopically abnormally integrated abGCs.

This study investigates how exposure to EE during abstinence dynamically affects brain neuroadaptations induced by voluntary intake of cocaine. Methods: Using longitudinal 18FDG microPET imaging, we examined brain metabolic activity in rats following extended access cocaine self-administration. After establishing escalation of cocaine intake, rats were housed in either enriched or standard environments during a four-week abstinence period. Brain metabolic activity was assessed after one and four weeks of abstinence. Results: Cocaine self-administration produced widespread decreases in cortical metabolic activity, particularly in regions involved in executive function (orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate) and interoception (insula), while increasing activity in emotional and motivational circuits (nucleus accumbens, amygdala, mesencephalon). EE selectively normalized these alterations through temporally distinct mechanisms: rapidly restoring nucleus accumbens and amygdala function while gradually affecting prefrontal cortical activity. After four weeks, rats housed in enriched environments showed significantly normalized metabolic activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral striatum compared to those in standard housing, with persistent changes in anterior cingulate cortex and ventral posterior hippocampus. Conclusions: Our findings reveal circuit-specific and temporally distinct effects of environmental enrichment on cocaine-induced brain alterations.

Studies in many types of cancer have shown that pre-existing tumor reactive T-cells are not only tumor- but typically also patient-specific, requiring personalized treatment options. For viral infections, public T-cell receptors (TCRs) with substantial sequence homologies suggest shared immune-dominant targets in human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched individuals. We hypothesized that also in the complex TCR repertoires of tumors subsets of tumor-specific TCRs exist that can be found in different patients with identical or near identical TCRs. This paper presents a TCR-V(D)J-sequence clustering approach identifying clusters of tumor-specific common TCRs mainly from TILs of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Using two TCR-clusters as examples, we show that T-cells engineered genetically to only express those common TCRs recognized HLA-matched allogeneic tumor cell lines in a cluster typical manner. Recognition of allogeneic tumors was dependent on the HLA allele inferred by the cluster and could be blocked by HLA antibodies. In addition to NSCLC, TCR repertoire analyses in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and a smaller number of breast and colorectal cancer samples revealed TCRs highly homologous or even identical to NSCLC cluster TCRs. TCR-T cells expressing TCRs from these tumors assigned to a specific cluster recognized allogeneic tumor lines in the expected cluster-typical manner.

In particular, it remains unclear how the tight and complementary packing between apolar side chains observed in the core of membrane proteins contributes to their stability. Complementary packing is a necessary feature since packing defects are generally destabilizing for membrane proteins. The question is the extent by which packing of apolar side chains -- and the resulting van der Waals interactions -- are a sufficient driving force for stabilizing the interaction between transmembrane helices in the absence of hydrogen bonding and polar interactions. We addressed this question with an approach based on high-throughout protein design and the homodimerization of single-pass helices as the model system. We designed hundreds of transmembrane helix dimers mediated by apolar packing in the backbone configurations that are most commonly found in membrane proteins. We assessed the association propensity of the designs in the membrane of Escherichia coli and found that they were most often monomeric or, at best, weakly dimeric Conversely, a set of controls designed in the backbone configuration of the GASright motif, which is mediated by weak hydrogen bonds, displayed significantly higher dimerization propensity. The data suggest that packing of apolar side chains and van der Waals forces are not sufficient as a general force for driving strong dimerization. It also confirms that GASright is a special configuration for achieving stability in membrane proteins.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

However, intracellular immune checkpoints such as CISH, which function independently of tumor-expressed ligands, offer powerful and previously untapped therapeutic potential.

Though historically considered undruggable, recent advances in CRISPR engineering have enabled functional interrogation of these targets. We demonstrate that CISH deletion enhances T cell activation and anti-cancer functions more effectively than other emerging intracellular checkpoints. In CAR-T cells, CISH inactivation significantly increased sensitivity to tumor antigen, enabling robust recognition and killing even at low antigen levels, conditions that often lead to treatment failure with conventional T cell therapies, mirroring antigen escape scenarios seen in solid tumors. Our findings further validate CISH as a potent and druggable intracellular checkpoint capable of boosting anti-tumor T cell responses across diverse cancer types, independent of PD-L1 status.

E.", "abstract": "The primary function of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is to mediate non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue by facilitating proton transport across mitochondrial membranes. However, recent study has shown that UCP1 from the opossum (a marsupial) lacks thermogenic activity (Keipert et al., Science, 2024). This deficiency was attributed to two altered residues, K100 and Y289, within the cytosolic salt bridge network. Interestingly, the same residues are also present in UCP2 and UCP3 from murine species, both of which are known to transport protons in the presence of long-chain fatty acids (FAs). This raises questions about the validity of the proposed mechanism involving these residues in the loss of thermogenic function in opossum UCP1. In this study, we performed conductance measurements of planar lipid bilayers reconstituted with either recombinant mouse UCP1, or UCP1 mutant (Q100K/F289Y), or UCP2, or UCP3. Our data demonstrate that the conductance of the UCP1 double mutant, UCP2, and UCP3 is comparable to that of wild-type mouse UCP1 in the presence of palmitic or arachidonic acids. These findings suggest that the altered cytosolic residues (K100 and Y289) do not explain the lack of thermogenic function in opossum UCP1. Thus, the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the absence of thermogenesis in opossum UCP1 remains unresolved, and further studies are warranted to elucidate the precise cause of this dysfunction. Given the emerging interest in UCP1 uncoupling as a potential therapeutic approach for treating obesity by increasing energy expenditure, understanding the molecular basis of UCP1 thermogenic dysfunction is of significant relevance.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Replicating the heterogeneity and complexity of cellular conditions in experiments and simulations to quantify the crowding influences remains a formidable challenge. As an alternative, homogeneous mixtures of polymers or proteins as crowders are employed, although they provide limited insight to the actual effect. In this work, we present a coarse- grained model of GB1 dimerization in lysozyme crowders by adjusting the GB1-lysozyme effective potential parameters obtained through high-resolution Martini simulation. Employing these parameters it is shown that GB1 dimerization is destabilized in presence of lysozyme, as observed in experiments. The model is further extended to incorporate binary crowder mixtures for crowder species of various sizes and interaction potentials. It is found that depending on mixing conditions and crowder volume fraction, dimerization can either be stabilized or destabilized. In particular, in presence of crowders of different sizes, the smaller one plays the dominant role. Finally, we observe that the overall change of stability due to crowding emerges from a delicate balance between enthalpy and entropy that cannot be predicted by considering the property of single crowder species.

Here, we identify the cell cycle inhibitor p57 as a regulator of quiescence and chemotherapy resistance in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) MB. Nuclear p57 was enriched in Sox2+ and Nestin+ stem-like MB cells compared to proliferative Atoh1+ cells. Inducing p57 expression in SHH MB cells led to a six-fold increase in G0-phase cells and conferred resistance to the frontline chemotherapeutic vincristine.

We show that dexamethasone significantly increased nuclear p57 levels and expanded the G0 population in both Ptch1+/- and Ptch1+/-;Trp53-/- SHH MB models. Pre-treatment with dexamethasone reduced vincristine sensitivity in SHH MB cells.

Current immunotherapies, including PD-1/PD-L1 blockades and adoptive T cell therapies, show limited response rates and durability. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an FDA-approved drug for autoimmune diseases, has demonstrated that it might exhibit direct antitumor activity in several cancers. However, its influence on anti-tumor immunity and its function in CC remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of DMF in CC models and elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. Methods: CC cell lines and mouse models were treated with DMF. Transcriptional level changes in cervical cancer cells following DMF treatment were analyzed by RNA-seq. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release, and cGAS-STING activation were assessed via qPCR, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting and ELISA. CD8+ T cell recruitment was analyzed by flow cytometry. Combinatorial therapies (DMF + anti-PD-1/TILs) were tested in syngeneic or patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models. Results: DMF treatment induces mitochondrial dysfunction in tumor cells, resulting in the release of mtDNA into the cytosol. The cytosolic mtDNA activates the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway and type I interferon response, leading to the secretion of CCL5 and CXCL10, thereby enhancing CD8 T cell infiltration. Additionally, DMF exhibits synergistic effect with PD-1 blockade in murine CC model, and can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells toward CC patient-derived xenografts model. Conclusion: This work elucidated that DMF reprograms CC cells to activate the mtDNA-cGAS-STING pathway, fostering a chemokine-rich microenvironment that recruits CD8+ T cells. Its synergy with PD-1 blockade or TIL therapy underscores its potential as an immunomodulatory adjuvant.

These assessments typically measure the match between an organism or population's TPC and the distribution of its current or future thermal environment as a proxy for extinction risk.

Here, we develop a new metric for assessing extinction risk using a stochastic model of logistic growth as a foundation. We show that boundaries delimiting persistence and extinction regions of parameter space can be derived for the simple case where the intrinsic (Malthusian) growth rate r varies stochastically and that these boundaries continue to make reliable predictions when temperature T varies stochastically and the Malthusian growth rate is given by a thermal performance curve r(T). We accomplish this by combining theory with stochastic simulations of population dynamics and a laboratory experiment where populations of the single-celled protist Paramecium caudatum were cultured across different temporal means and variances of temperature. The measure of risk that we develop and validate is straightforward and easily applicable to any population for which the thermal performance of Malthusian fitness is known, allowing more rigorous identification of the risks imposed by warmer and more variable temperatures across the globe.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigate how different levels of soil disturbance influence the assembly and robustness of the root fungal microbiome. Using a microcosm experiment, we inoculated plants with soil from environments with decreasing levels of disturbance - agricultural field, field margin, and uncultivated field - and tested the variation in composition, assembly process, and network stability of the root fungal microbiome. Our results reveal that more disturbed systems, i.e. agricultural soils, harbor microbiomes with less robust networks compared to systems with lower disturbance. Network analysis identified arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as key taxa contributing to microbiome stability, suggesting their critical role in maintaining the robustness of root-associated fungal microbiomes. Furthermore, stochastic processes dominated fungal community assembly across all soil treatments, yet the key taxa that deviated from null-model predictions include those with a major role in network robustness, and were mainly identified as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Together, our results suggest that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are major actors in assembling robust plant microbiomes, and soil disturbance is a key factor in disrupting these interactions.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that establishing early-life infection with H. pylori, a symbiotic bacterial species that has co-evolved with humans for at least 300,000 years, worsens the impact of induced obesity. To test this hypothesis, we treated C57BL/6JRj neonatal mice with H. pylori or not and subjected them to a high-fat diet (HFD) after weaning. Two diet intervention experiments were conducted: (1) a short-term (three-week) intervention to primarily monitor blood plasma metabolic hormone and cytokine levels, and (2) a long-term (five-month) intervention to primarily monitor fecal and gastrointestinal microbiome composition. We observed that H. pylori infection mediated differences in diet responses with increased visceral fat accumulation, and higher levels of leptin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in HFD male mice, which correlated with H. pylori load. Additionally, infection altered the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome. From our models, we conclude that early-life infection with H. pylori accelerates metabolic health decline in the face of a diet-induced obesity challenge, through modulation of inflammatory responses and gut microbiome composition.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

The Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), a plant multi-gene family protein, act as sensors of calcium ion concentration inside plant cells. CDPKs convert variations in calcium concentration into a signal and phosphorylate various proteins that translate calcium signals into physiological reactions. Aquilaria agallocha is an aromatically important crop due to the production of valuable fragrant resinous agarwood in their heartwood. The trees produce agarwood when wounded and exposed to biotic and abiotic stresses. CDPKs are essential in plant development and growth, biotic and abiotic stress responses, and phytohormone-mediated signalling pathways. A comprehensive investigation of the stress-combating gene family (CDPK) in the A. agallocha genome is currently lacking. In this work, we used a bioinformatics approach to examine the entire genome of A. agallocha and identified 24 CDPK genes. According to the molecular phylogenetic relationships, the putative AaCDPKs are grouped into four groups. Synteny analysis identified a few conserved segments (orthologous genes) between A. agallocha and Arabidopsis thaliana (eight pairs), A. sinensis (twenty pairs), Glycine max (sixteen pairs), Solanum tuberosum (five pairs), and Vitis vinifera (ten pairs). Duplication analysis of AaCDPK genes indicated that dispersed duplications significantly contributed to the expansion of the CDPK gene family of A. agallocha. The observed AaCDPK-RBOH interaction within the protein interaction network suggests that this interaction may be crucial in integrating Ca2+ and ROS signaling pathways. RNA-seq data analysis shows differential expression of seven putative AaCDPK genes in agarwood tissue. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that six out of ten selected AaCDPK genes exhibited altered expression levels in response to MeJA, H2O2, and CaCl2 treatments. Integrated promoter analysis, PPI data, and in silico gene expression validated with qRT-PCR-analysis collectively suggest the role of CDPK-RBOH as a signalling molecule in initiating phytohormone-mediated agarwood resin formation.

Predicting protein conformational ensembles under the influence of external interactions remains a significant challenge both experimentally and computationally. While deep generative models have been developed to predict protein structural ensembles, their application to systems involving external interactions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a method that integrates a deep generative model with physics-based interaction modeling to predict protein conformations under external constraints.

FN acts as an extracellular glue, controlling the assembly of other macromolecular constituents to the ECM. However, how FN participates in the binding and retention of synovial fluid components, the natural lubricant of articulated joints, to form a wear-protecting and lubricating film has not been established. This study reports on the role of FN and its molecular conformation in mediating macromolecular assembly of synovial fluid ad-layers. FN films as precursor films on functionalized surfaces, a model of FN's articular cartilage surface, adsorbed and retained different amounts of synovial fluid (SF). FN conformational changes were induced by depositing FN at pH 7 (extended state) or at pH 4 (unfolded state) on self-assembled monolayers on gold-coated quartz crystals, followed by adsorption of diluted SF (25%) onto FN precursor films. Mass density, thin film compliance, surface morphologies, and adsorbed FN films' secondary and tertiary structures reveal pH-induced differences. FN films deposited at pH 4 were thicker, more rigid, showed a more homogeneous morphology, and had altered alpha-helix and beta-sheet content, compared to FN films deposited at pH 7. FN precursor films deposited at pH 7 adsorbed and retained more synovial fluid than those at pH 4, revealing the importance of FN conformation at the articular cartilage surface to bind and maintain a thin lubricating and wear protective layer of synovial fluid constituents. This knowledge will enable a better understanding of the molecular regulation of articular cartilage-SF interface homeostasis and joint pathophysiology and identify molecular interactions and synergies between the articular cartilage ECM and SF to reveal the complexity of joint biotribology.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that T cells activated in the tumor draining lymph node (tdLN) also respond to PD-I ICB. We assessed clonal dynamics of tumor-specific tdLN T cell clones by using single- cell TCR barcoding integrated with transcriptional profiling (scRNA sequencing) by using machine learning (ML) and bioinformatic approaches. We displayed that within the tumor tdLN-paired clones were less exhausted than clones not clonally linked to the tdLN. We established that there are two distinct LN-paired anti-tumor clonal populations: those that directly link from the tdLN and tumor (tdLN-tumor paired) with tumor killing capacity, and clones that circulate within the blood with cytotoxic memory surveillance potential. Furthermore, the transcriptional distinction of these two LN-paired subsets was set in the earliest memory state of expanded tumor-specific tdLN T cells and reflected in the tumor as similarly, more differentiated, effector subsets. ChemoIO was also found to directly impact tdLN-paired clonal diversity and memory phenotypic differentiation. Finally, our findings demonstrate that ChemoIO is enhancing the cytotoxic function of circulating LN-paired clones in the tdLN and subsequently also altering circulating blood LN-paired clonal phenotype.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissues in digitised whole slide images (WSIs) enable computational histopathology; however, artificial intelligence (AI)-based analyses of normal breast tissue (NBT) remain scarce. Methods: We curated 70 WSIs of NBTs from multiple sources with pathologist-guided manual annotations of epithelium, stroma, and adipocytes, and developed robust convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, patch-level classification models, named NBT-Classifiers, to tessellate and classify NBTs at different scales.

Findings: Across three external cohorts, NBT-Classifiers trained on 128 x 128 um and 256 x 256 um patches achieved AUCs of 0.98-1.00. Two explainable artificial-intelligence (AI)-visualisation techniques confirmed the biological relevance of tissue class predictions.

Male Wistar rats were randomized to one of four diets starting at weaning to ~6.5 months on age: a low-fat (LF) diet containing 10% fat by weight, a HF diet containing 45% fat by weight to induce cognitive impairment, and a HF diet containing either 1.6% or 10% WPPC by weight (n=12 per diet). Rats were subjected to cognitive testing after 2 and 4 months of dietary intervention and then implanted with chronic bipolar electrodes to measure axonal evoked responses within the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal circuitry. Phospholipid and sphingolipid components of myelin were quantified in the hippocampus. There were no significant differences in cognition measured by novel object recognition after 2 months of supplementation. At 4 months, rats on the HF diet performed significantly worse than rats on the LF, HF1.6 and HF10 diets. The beneficial effects of WPPC on cognition were due to a partial reversal in evoked response impairments in hippocampal memory storage. Additionally, hippocampus sphingolipids were higher in rats on the HF diet compared to the LF, HF1.6 and HF10 groups.

As a result, counting cells can achieve similar predictive performance as Cell Painting or gene expression data. Filtering benchmarks to include only assays relating to protein targets reveals that Cell Painting can capture information that cannot be predicted by mere cell counting. We re-evaluated three benchmark datasets used with Cell Painting data and observed that, in many cases, cell count models produced an AUC comparable to models using the full Cell Painting profiles.

Here, we describe the molecular basis of sex determination in the monocot Dioscorea tokoro, a dioecious wild yam endemic to East Asia. Chromosome-scale and haplotype-resolved genome assemblies and linkage analysis suggested that this plant has a male heterogametic sex determination (XY) system, with sex determination regions located on chromosome 3. Sequence read coverage analysis of the sex chromosomes revealed X- and Y-specific regions in putative pericentromeric chromosome regions. Within the Y-specific region, we identified two candidate genes that are likely involved in sex determination: BLH9, encoding a homeobox protein, and HSP90, encoding a molecular chaperone. BLH9 has similar functions to AtBLH9 in Arabidopsis thaliana. BLH9 is thought to suppress female organ development, whereas HSP90 might be required for pollen development.

While mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) is well-established for its role in regulating type I and III IFN production, our research unveils a previously unidentified, yet more significant, overarching function: MAVS acts as a protector of mitochondria against mitophagy triggered by viruses and toxins. We show that MAVS is crucial for maintaining TOM complex functionality by influencing the levels of key outer and inner membranes translocases (TOM20/TOM70/TIM23), and the spatial distribution/organization between TOM20:TOM70 in mitochondria. Disruptions to these features caused by MAVS loss, likely compromise mitochondrial protein import, leading to increased mitochondrial PINK1 stabilization and its phosphorylation, and elevated mitophagy. These changes resulted in significantly compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics, with implications on immune response. Notably, MAVS supplementation not only mitigated mitophagy in MAVS KO cells, but also conferred protection against mitophagy induced by viruses (SARS-CoV-2, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)), and mitotoxins, indicating its broad protective role against mitophagy. Furthermore, we reveal that MAVS-mediated mitochondrial stabilization elicits a robust antiviral immunity against mitophagy-inducing viruses without engaging IFN- and NF-{kappa}B pathways, underscoring the significance of this mechanism in host antiviral defense. The redefined role of MAVS as a critical mitochondrial stabilizer has implications extending beyond its broad antiviral immunity, which involves both IFN-dependent and IFN-independent mechanisms, to encompass various pathological conditions involving mitochondrial dysfunction.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

These ligands bind and activate CARF immune effectors that cause cell toxicity to prevent the completion of the viral lytic cycle. Here we investigated two proteins containing an N-terminal haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) phosphatase domain followed by four predicted transmembrane helices and a C-terminal CARF domain, which we named Chp. We show that, in vivo, Chp localizes to the bacterial membrane and that its activation induces a growth arrest, leads to a depletion of ATP and IMP and prevents phage propagation during the type III CRISPR-Cas response. In vitro, the CARF domain of Chp binds cyclic tetra-adenylates and the HAD phosphatase domain dephosphorylates dATP, ATP and IMP.

In small animals such as insects, the contribution of passive forces to limb movement can match the active forces. However, most measurements of passive forces are limited to the femur-tibia joint in large insects. Here we take advantage of genetic tools in Drosophila to measure passive torques at multiple joints in the flys leg. We genetically inactivate all the motor neurons to assess passive forces. We find that the passive torques are well approximated by a linear spring, i.e., the passive torques linearly increase with angular deviation from the rest angle. The torques are much larger than the gravitational torque due to the leg itself. We estimate that the passive torques are seventy times smaller than necessary to support the weight of the animal. We also inactivated all the motor neurons in a freely standing fly and found that, as predicted from the model, the fly falls when the motor neurons are inactivated. We found that the height at which a fly stands, and, therefore the active forces vary. The flys height affects the time to initiate a fall. The time it takes for the fall is consistent with the active forces decaying with a time constant of ~100 ms. Thus, although passive forces are strong and will have a large effect on limb kinematics, they are not strong enough to support the weight of the fly.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we elucidate the key role of GBP1 in driving lysosomal activity against mycobacterial infection in human macrophages. We show that phagosome damage induced by the mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system triggers calcium release, and thereby the recruitment of GBP1, which resides in lysosomes upon interferon gamma activation. GBP1 targeting of mycobacteria-containing phagosomes leads to the recruitment of other GBPs but does not lead to the activation of membrane repair mechanisms or antimicrobial autophagy. Instead, GBP1 mediates lysosomal recruitment to intracellular mycobacteria, and promotes the maturation of phagolysosomes and their proteolytic activity required for the degradation of the mycobacterial cargo. Collectively, this work highlights the host-protective function of GBP1 in macrophages, where GBP1 acts as a key cellular sensor of mycobacterial infection and promotes the clearance activity of the host lysosomal system.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

We examined these mice under homeostatic conditions and in response to major physiological challenges.

The model design follows from an experimental system and uses a trait-based variational method to set trait values by maximizing entropy production over a specified interval of time. Model results show that short-term MEP optimization (STO) produces microbial communities that specialize in substrate preference and consumers that have fewer trophic levels than solutions based on long-term optimization (LTO) that have substrate generalist and more trophic levels.

Methods: To develop a robust murine model for S. aureus gastrointestinal infection (SAGII) and colonization, mice were (a) treated with varying antibiotic regimes prior to infection, (b) infected with either a methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) or a methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain, (c) challenged with different bacterial inocula, (d) tested for sexual dimorphism of SAGII virulence, and (e) tested for macronutrient effects on SAGII onset and virulence. Results: We found that antibiotic-treated male mice (but not female mice) were highly susceptible to even low inoculums of both an MSSA and an MRSA strains. Interestingly, male mice challenged with an MSSA strain showed more severe and more prolonged SAGII symptomatology than animals challenged with an MRSA strain. We also showed that for male mice a high-carbohydrate diet and a high-fat diet led to asymptomatic intestinal colonization followed by delayed SAGII sign onset. In contrast, male mice fed a high-protein diet started developing mild SAGII signs early but did not develop severe SAGII until two weeks post-challenge. Furthermore, only the high-protein diet sensitized female mice to SAGII, but their symptomatology remained less severe than in male mice. Conclusions: We developed a robust murine model for antibiotic-associated S. aureus gastrointestinal infection and colonization. This model shows both sexual dimorphism and macronutrient preference for SAGII severity.

Here, we quantitatively compared phage adsorption efficiencies across diverse Escherichia coli phages under controlled metabolic conditions. Using a standardized protocol, we measured adsorption rates () for five phages representing various life cycles (lytic, lysogenic, chronic) and entry pathways (LamB, FhuA, pilus, Tsx). Four of the five phages exhibited significantly reduced commitment to infection under energy-limited conditions. Notably, this effect varied. Phages with high baseline were less sensitive to metabolic inhibition than phages with low baseline . This observation suggests weak-binding phages may disengage under unfavorable conditions to avoid non-productive infections.

Conditional knockout of pbap2-tr caused developmental arrest at the trophozoite stage, i.e., the cell growth phase of asexual blood stage development. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing showed that PbAP2-TR binds to two different DNA motifs and targets genes that are downregulated towards late trophozoites, including ribosome biogenesis-related genes and host-modifying exported protein genes. The expression of these target genes was upregulated in pbap2-tr-knockout parasites, and introduction of mutations into the binding motifs increased the promoter activity of the target genes. These results indicate that PbAP2-TR establishes precise transcription peak patterns of its target genes by repressing their transcription during the trophozoite, thereby being essential for asexual blood stage development.

Beta- and gammaretroviruses are two classes of simple retroviruses known to integrate near promoters, and these viruses have a strong tendency to infect germ cells and endogenize. While ancient endogenous retroviruses are often easy to spot due to mutations rendering them non-functional, more recent integrants can maintain the capacity for full viral production, making it sometimes difficult to discern which integrants are exogenous and likely more clinically relevant. Because endogenous retroviruses generally spend a longer time integrated and subject to host epigenetic regulation as proviral DNA, we hypothesized we could show these integrants exhibit sequence differences from their exogenous counterparts, likely resulting from DNA methylation and histone modifications, and that endogenous retroviruses would generally show habituation to host promoters. Therefore, we have used statistical analyses of publicly available sequence data to demonstrate that endogenous retroviral variants exhibit decreased CpG dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies over time, and that they will show evidence for loss of histone modification motifs associated with actively transcribed genes. Close examination of these patterns provides further clues for distinguishing endogenous and exogenous retroviral variants, potentially aiding in the study of retroviruses in less well-characterized wildlife species where retroviral outbreaks are responsible for significant disease and decline in populations.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

This has been interpreted to suggest that genotoxic co-transcriptional R-loops arise under these conditions and are resolved by RNase H1. Here, we manipulated RNase H1 levels using conditional knockout and overexpression models in primary murine B cells and mapped the resulting genomic R-loop landscapes. Rnaseh1 deletion resulted in a dramatic loss of mitochondrial replication and compromised B cell responses, consistent with a critical mitochondrial function for RNase H1. Genome-wide R-loops were, however, not significantly affected. More surprisingly, overexpressing active nuclear RNase H1 did not lead to significant reduction of R-loop levels or change their distribution. These results were confirmed using a human cell line in which active, nuclear RNase H1 can be induced. Our findings indicate that co-transcriptional R-loops are not efficiently resolved by RNase H1 under basal conditions and suggest that the identity of the RNA/DNA hybrids at the root of the genome instability phenotypes suppressed by RNase H1 may need to be re-interpreted.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Cerebrospinal fluid heparan sulfate (HS) has been pursued as a biomarker for CNS disease. To determine whether CSF HS reflects disease in the brain, we generated a fusion protein of the NAGLU gene encoding alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (the enzyme deficient in Sanfilippo B) and the transmembrane region and cytosolic tail of LAMP1, which encodes the lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1, to tether the NAGLU enzyme to the membrane and prevent cross-correction. We used AAV7 to deliver the fusion construct intravenously to Sanfilippo B mice and showed that treatment of systemic bodily organs without treatment of brain did not result in reduction of CSF HS compared with untreated Sanfilippo B mice. Next, we used intracerebroventricular delivery of the construct in AAV9 under a synapsin-1 promotor to largely confine expression to brain neurons. We showed that treatment of the brain without treatment of systemic bodily organs resulted in reduction of HS in brain and CSF. These results support the utility of CSF HS as a therapeutic biomarker for Sanfilippo B and other disorders of heparan sulfate catabolism.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we describe the design of an RNA-targeted small molecule that thermodynamically stabilizes the structure of a pre-mRNA splicing regulator element in the MAPT pre-mRNA exon 10-intron junction to reduce the inclusion of exon 10 and hence 4R tau abundance. Structure-based drug design was used to obtain compounds that form a network of specific interactions to the RNA including multiple interactions between a one nucleotide A-bulge and the Hoogsteen face of a closing GC base pair, the latter of which was enabled by the design of base triple interactions. A battery of assays revealed that the compound binds the target in vitro and in cells and affects pre-mRNA splicing in various cellular models including primary neurons from a human tau (htau) knock-in mouse model. The orally bioavailable compound was administered per os (p.o.), where treatment diminished exon 10 inclusion, and reduced the 4R tau protein isoform. Further, the molecule mitigated cellular pathologies and behavioral phenotypes observed in the htau transgenic mouse model. This study provides a potentially general pipeline to design compounds that target RNAs and affect disease pathways and deliver compounds that have oral bioavailability and blood-brain barrier penetrance.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

We showed that TNF, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine, binds to site 2 and induces integrin activation, like other pro-inflammatory cytokines. We recently showed that two anti-inflammatory cytokines (FGF1 and NRG1) bind to site 2 and inhibit integrin activation by inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that ivermectin binds to site 2 but inhibits the integrin activation induced by inflammatory cytokines in a mechanism similar to anti-inflammatory cytokines (site 2 antagonists).

Axon diameter influences myelination, can be dynamically regulated, which might help fine-tune neural circuit function, and is altered in several diseases. Despite its importance, mechanisms regulating axon diameter remain poorly understood. This gap in understanding is due in part to the limitations of fixed tissue analyses, such as electron microscopy, which cannot be scaled up to execute discovery screens. To address this, we developed a high-resolution, high-content imaging-based in vivo platform to identify pharmacological modulators of axon diameter in zebrafish. We focused on the Mauthner neuron, whose axon diameter growth can be monitored during development. To facilitate our high-content chemical screen, we developed an automated high-resolution imaging and image analysis pipeline to assess changes in Mauthner axon diameter in transgenic reporter animals. We screened 880 compounds and identified 33 that altered Mauthner axon diameter. Validating this discovery pipeline, we confirmed that compounds that affect beta-2 adrenoceptor and dopamine signaling increase axon diameter in separate follow-up studies.

We identified Kazachstania pintolopesii as a dominant fungus in pet store mice across various geographical locations. This fungus stably colonized laboratory mice, outcompeted non-murine fungi, and persisted independently of gut bacteria without triggering conventional antifungal responses. Colonization by K. pintolopesii significantly increased intestinal macrophage populations, which was crucial in preventing systemic immune recognition. K. pintolopesii also induced intestinal type 2 immune responses, providing cross-kingdom protection against helminths in free-living mammals exposed to parasitic protozoa. Notably, K. pintolopesii strains from non-murine hosts failed to colonize laboratory mice with intact gut bacteria despite high genomic similarity. In gnotobiotic mice, these non-murine strains disrupted bacterial communities and their associated metabolomes, unlike the mouse strains.

Interactions between different species of pathogenic microbes often affect clinical outcome by altering either the virulence or antibiotic resistance phenotype of individual microbes. However, there is a gap in our understanding of microbial interactions at the sub-population and single-cell level. Here we investigate the dynamics of the interactions between Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the population, single-cell and molecular level using microbiology, microscopy and transcriptomic analyses. We discovered that in co-culture with P. aeruginosa, a sub-population of S. aureus enters in a viable non-culturable state that it is not detected via standard microbiology assays. Consistently, in the presence of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus adopts a survival lifestyle similar to previously described intracellular S. aureus persisters, downregulating nitrogen metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis, while upregulating protein maturation processes. S. aureus also upregulates several efflux pumps in the presence of P. aeruginosa, leading to reduced killing by ciprofloxacin, whereas only a minority of the S. aureus population survive ciprofloxacin treatment while in a viable but non culturable state. In contrast, entrance in a viable but non culturable state is the primary survival strategy of S. aureus in response to vancomycin treatment. These multilayered bacterial interactions may shape the evolution of resistance traits of co-infecting pathogens, therefore, manipulating these interspecies adaptations could provide new opportunities for early therapeutic interventions, particularly in chronic mixed infections.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Of the 84 patients where P. aeruginosa genomes could be recovered, there were 27 cases where the same P. aeruginosa clone was detected across multiple body sites. Using a simulation approach, we found that the majority of body site sharing was likely due to within-patient translocation of clones rather than independent acquisition from the hospital environment. Using ancestral reconstruction, we predicted that most clones likely occupied a respiratory niche, and that the probable direction of clone transmission was lung-to-gut. We detected within-patient variation and noted a strong enrichment of mutations in genes associated with antimicrobial resistance, irrespective of sample type. There was significantly more translocation than has been previously reported and highlight that lower respiratory tract infections can result in persistent gut colonisation of P. aeruginosa, a major risk factor for sepsis in vulnerable hosts.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

Some rRNA genes carry truncated insertions, creating defective rRNA from which the R2 sequence cannot be excised. Here, we report that in Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear protein Piwi loaded with PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) is required to repress transcription of rDNA units with extensively truncated R2 insertions (R2short). Without Piwi, R2short-rDNA generates stable aberrant 28S rRNA containing ~200 nt of R2 sequence.

Although chromosome X and Y differentiated from one another, they still share high levels of sequence similarity in some regions, like the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs) and the X-transposed region (XTR). The sex chromosomes violate some assumptions of autosomal pairs, but are not always processed separately in genomics analyses. Here, we undertook a simulation study to assess the effects of standard autosomal versus sex chromosome complement-informed alignment, variant calling, and variant filtering strategies on variants detected on the human sex chromosomes. We find that aligning samples to a reference genome informed by the sex chromosome complement of the sample increases the number of true positives called in the PARs, and, in XX-samples only, also the XTR. In contrast, in XY-samples, masking the XTR during alignment results in a ten-fold higher rate of false positives. We further find that haploid calling on the sex chromosomes in XY-samples reduces the number of false positives compared to diploid calling, but does not decrease the number of false negatives. Improving the accuracy of variant calling results in detection of variants that could be relevant to studies of health and disease, including variants we recovered in genes implicated in cardiomyopathy, immunodeficiency, and Alzheirmer's disease, among others. We recommend future genomic analyses implement the following best practices for detecting variants: aligning samples to versions of the human reference genome informed by the sex chromosome complement of the sample and using accurate ploidy parameters when calling variants.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}

In this study, we present a computational pipeline for the in silico design of RNA aptamers capable of targeting FUS, including its aggregated forms. By integrating CLIP data, de novo motif enrichment, secondary structure prediction, and catRAPID-based interaction scoring, we screened over 28,000 RNA sequences and identified high-affinity aptamer candidates predicted to bind solvent-exposed, aggregation-resistant regions of FUS. The top candidates adopted stable hairpin structures favorable for interaction with the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and contained a GGU motif in the 3' region to enhance binding to the zinc finger domain. Biolayer interferometry confirmed strong binding affinities in the low nanomolar range, with a high correlation to computational predictions. Circular dichroism analysis further validated the presence of stable hairpin conformations. When tested in post-mortem brain tissue from ALS patients harboring the P525L FUS mutation, the aptamers selectively labeled pathological FUS aggregates - including nuclear inclusions and nucleolar localization patterns - while demonstrating greater specificity than conventional antibodies.

In this process, actin depolymerization factors (ADFs) function as key player through both severing and depolymerizing actin microfilaments. However, recent evidence suggests that ADFs may possess non-canonical immune functions inside the nucleus, in addition to a cytosolic role, a phenomenon not adequately explained by the traditional mechanistic model of ADFs and actin. In this study, we demonstrate that ADFs indeed have a moonlighting function in the nucleus, interacting with transcriptional machinery and regulating the transcriptome during both resting states and immune responses. Specifically, ADF2/3/4 exhibit redundant functions in defense against virulent and avirulent Pseudomonas, but not certain species of Pectobacterium and powdery mildew. Notably, nuclear, rather than cytosolic, ADFs contribute to defense against Pseudomonas and mediate pro-immune transcription. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that nuclear ADFs interact with transcription factors, histone complexes, and other components of the transcriptional machinery. Specifically, ADF2/3/4 can form a complex with WRKY transcription factors (such as WRKY22/29/48), thereby binding to promoters and directly regulating WRKY activity to shape the pro-immune transcriptome.

Effective long-term management of FLS in soybean calls for the discovery of antifungal compounds with new modes of action (MoA), durability and safety. Here, we showed that chickpea nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptide, NCR13_Peptide Folding Variant1 (NCR13_PFV1), exhibited antifungal activity against QoI-sensitive and -resistant field isolates of C. sojina at nanomolar concentrations representing the first antifungal NCR peptide reported effective against C. sojina. Spray-application of this peptide showed no phytotoxicity and effectively protected soybean against FLS.

NCR13_PFV1 induced plasma membrane disruption and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in C. sojina. NCR13_PFV1 was rapidly internalized into fungal cells where it accumulated in the cytoplasm, localized inside nucleus, bound to fungal ribosomal RNA and inhibited protein translation in vivo.

Cellular analyses reveal that this aberrant phenotype correlates with abnormal volume changes of motor cells within the pulvinus. DLM1 exhibits high expression level in the motor organ pulvinus and encodes an unreported nuclear-localized PP2C phosphatase. Notably, phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that species exhibiting rhythmic leaflet movement consistently retain DLM1 homologs, suggesting the possibility of its functionally conserved role in regulating leaflets movement pattern.

Using forward genetic screens, we identified C. elegans mutants that escape fungal traps and revealed the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-66 as a key regulator of fungal-nematode adhesion. Loss-of-function mutations in nhr-66 conferred resistance to fungal trapping through the downregulation of a large subset of cuticular collagen genes. Restoring collagen gene expression in nhr-66 mutants abolished the escape phenotype, highlighting the essential role of these structural proteins in fungal-nematode adhesion. Furthermore, sequence analysis of natural C. elegans populations revealed no obvious loss-of-function variants in nhr-66, suggesting selective pressures exist that balance adhesion-mediated predation risk with physiological robustness.

Further supplementation with -ketoglutarate, a downstream metabolite of PHGDH, partially reversed this inhibitory effect.

M. M.; Bekale, L.; Cao, Z.", "abstract": "Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is not just a bacterial infection of the middle ear but a leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Yet, the mechanisms by which this disease leads to SNHL have remained elusive until now. Our study uncovers how Pseudomonas aeruginosa outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) directly damage cochlear hair cells. In both in vitro and in vivo models, OMVs were found to attack outer hair cells (OHCs) in the basal cochlea, which are responsible for high-frequency hearing and independent of macrophage activity. Beyond this damage, OMVs trigger intense inflammation, marked by increased pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, which worsens the damage. OMVs also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, driving inflammatory cell death through pyroptosis. RNA sequencing and proteomics confirmed this pathway, and treatment with the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 significantly reduced hearing loss in animal models. These findings reveal a new therapeutic target in the NLRP3 inflammasome, offering hope for innovative treatments to prevent hearing loss in CSOM patients.", "date": "2025-04-30", "journal": ""}
