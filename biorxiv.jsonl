H.", "abstract": "Arthropods (insects, non-insect crustaceans, myriapods, and chelicerates) display a fascinating diversity of ectodermal structures like plates, horns, helmets, knobs, carapaces, mimicry outgrowths, and wings. The origins and relationships of these structures has tantalized researchers for over a century: did these structures arise de novo in each lineage, or do they emerge from shared, ancestral primordia present in some or even all arthropods? One way to begin answering this is to assess the position and context of these structures on arthropod bodies: do these structures emerge from proximal embryonic leg segments that were incorporated into the body wall, or do they represent dorsal, non-leg-derived structures? Here, the expression of pannier, araucan, and drumstick (genes previously shown to distinguish proximal leg segments in crustaceans and insects) are examined in a chelicerate representative, the tarantula Acanthoscurria. This gene expression comparison, together with over a century of gene functional, morphological, embryological, and paleontological data, suggests that all arthropod leg segments correspond to each other in a one-to-one fashion, but that in many arthropod lineages, the base of the ancestral leg in the embryo flattens and expands to form the body wall of the adult. This would mean that many arthropod outgrowths which appear to stand on the lateral body wall, such as wings, tergal plates, and gin traps, are derived from the ancestral/embryonic leg base, and likely arose from shared, ancestral primordia present on this leg base in all arthropods. The analysis detailed here means that a simple three- or four-gene in situ expression experiment with pannier, araucan, and drumstick can elucidate the homologies of any arthropod ectodermal structure of interest, including beetle horns, treehopper helmets, and more.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

Local adaptation along environmental gradients may be driven by trade-offs in allocation to reproduction, growth, and herbivore resistance. To identify environmental agents of selection and their phenotypic targets, we performed a manipulative field reciprocal transplant experiment with coastal perennial and inland annual ecotypes of the common yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus). We manipulated herbivory with exclosures built in the field and exogenously manipulated gibberellin and jasmonic acid to shift allocation of plant resources among growth, reproduction, and herbivore resistance. Our hormone treatments influenced the timing of allocation to reproduction and allocation to phytochemical defense, but this shift was small relative to ecotype differences in allocation. Herbivore exclosures reduced herbivory and increased fitness of plants at the coastal site. However, this reduction in herbivory did not decrease the homesite advantage of coastal perennials. Unexpectedly, we found that the application of exogenous gibberellin increased mortality due to salt spray at the coastal site for both ecotypes. Our results suggest that divergence in salt spray tolerance, potentially mediated by ecotype differences in gibberellin synthesis or bioactivity, is a strong driver of local adaptation and preempts any impacts of herbivory in coastal habitats that experience salt spray.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

Importantly, underlying the measurements, which are affected by experimental noise, there is a complex computational mechanism that is inherently hard to identify. To address these difficulties, we present a novel approach that uses algorithmic complexity to infer a Boolean network model from experimental data. We present an algorithm that is optimal within this framework and allows for asynchronicity network dynamics.

While polarity is traditionally associated with biochemical patterning, the morphological aspect of axis formation remains elusive. In regenerating Hydra tissues, we find that morphological evolution in all tissue samples depends on inherited positional information from the donor's axis, and a foot precursor emerges early in the process. From the onset of regeneration, the Ca2+ excitations that drive actomyosin forces for tissue reshaping follow a gradient aligned with the head-foot polarity direction. We conclude that polarity and morphological axis progression occur concurrently through interlinked processes, and that the foot plays a dominant role in this process, a role usually attributed to the head organizer. A simple toy model accounts for the observed regeneration dynamics and illustrates the mechanochemical integration of polarity and morphogenesis.

Pollinator-attracting traits evolved on a rapid time scale of less than ten years, but genetic covariances between traits limited the adaptive rate and evolutionary trajectory of flowering phenology, a trait with widely recognized importance in adapting to climatic shifts.

However, the mechanisms underlying its age-related upregulation are not well understood. Here, we report that in budding yeast, Cdc42 accumulates over successive divisions and that lowering its levels can extend lifespan. Using microfluidics-assisted live-cell imaging and genetic analysis, we found that Cdc42 is distributed unevenly between mother and daughter cells during division. Daughter cells inherit lower levels of Cdc42, which likely helps them remain young. This asymmetric distribution depends on the localization of Cdc42 to endomembranes and involves Ydj1, a farnesylated Hsp40/DnaJ chaperone anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ydj1 interacts with Cdc42, enhancing its stability and proper partitioning during cell division. We thus propose that ER-bound Ydj1 facilitates the asymmetric distribution of Cdc42, limiting aging to mother cells.

Since aging is understood to differently influence integrity of short- and long-term memory, we compared performance between younger (YAs) and older (OAs) adults using a modified Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm to understand whether semantic and phonological memories depend on distinct or shared underlying memory stores. OAs recalled fewer items than YAs, but both groups generated more phonological than semantic false memories. Notably, list position did not influence false memories in either YAs or OAs, suggesting false memory generation is driven by list composition rather than putative memory store.

Synaptic inputs that are activated coincidently with postsynaptic action potential firing are strengthened, and inputs from cells firing before or after the postsynaptic action potential are weakened. An implicit assumption, however, is that the speed of impulse transmission is not altered by visual deprivation. If so, spike time arrival at binocular neurons would be affected, thereby inducing synaptic plasticity. This possibility is tested here in adult mice by monocular eyelid suture and monocular action potential inhibition in retinal axons. The results show that spike time arrival in visual cortex is altered by monocular visual disruption in association with morphological changes in myelin (nodes of Ranvier) on axons in optic nerve and optic tract. This non-synaptic mechanism of ocular dominance plasticity, mediated by myelin-forming cells, supplements and may drive synaptic plasticity.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

In particular, the subunit of curli fibrils, CsgA, has recently had its fibril assembly deciphered by cryoEM. However, the folding of CsgA has yet to be careful examined. We report the first in vitro single molecule folding trajectories of CsgA, constituting two principal modes: discrete and non-piecewise unfolding reflective of the assembly of R domains, and a blend of metastable states or of a molten globule. Moreover, extending refolding time to many seconds does not obstruct the appearance of metastable states. We also present the refolding CsgA using constant trap separation, lengthening out the process to several minutes. In order to restrain the aggregation propensity of this protein, we developed an assay to trigger native folding of CsgA under controlled conditions in a microfluidic flow cell. From there we measured the individual folding trajectories of single molecules of CsgA using force spectroscopy by optical tweezers. This work exploits an engineered disulfide trap in the protein, where native folding becomes possible after reduction of the cysteine substitutions. When folding, CsgA does not get locked into a native {beta}-hairpin assembly, but can be found in a metastable state in about a quarter of the incidences in which it is probed.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

Existing spatial statistical methods typically overlook within-sample variability, resulting in unreliable inference and reduced reproducibility when analyzing new groups of samples. We introduce PANORAMIC, a hierarchical framework for efficient estimation and statistical testing of colocalization between pairs of cell types in spatial omics. PANORAMIC integrates spatial bootstrapping to quantify within-sample variability with random-effects meta-analysis to pool information on the colocalization of each cell pair and account for heterogeneity across independent samples within a group. Simulation analyses of images of multiple cell types generated from spatial point process models show that PANORAMIC accurately estimates variance components at the sample and group levels and outperforms naive pooling in key benchmarks. Applied to spatial omics images from colorectal cancer tissue microarrays imaged using a high-multiplexed immunofluorescence platform, PANORAMIC identifies higher colocalization among B- and T-cell subsets in samples with Crohn's-like reactions (CLR) compared with samples exhibiting diffuse inflammatory infiltration (DII). These findings are consistent with tertiary lymphoid structure formation, more favorable prognosis in CLR versus DII, and were missed by existing computational methods. By modeling uncertainty at multiple hierarchical levels and enabling properly powered between-group comparisons, PANORAMIC addresses a gap in spatial omics analysis.

MeCP2 is a transcriptional regulator that induces changes in the expression of thousands of genes. We previously performed an mRNA expression profiling study of the temporal cortex region from a cohort of autopsy samples from patients diagnosed with RTT and corresponding age, postmortem interval, and sex-matched controls. These studies identified a significant reduction in the expression of the histamine H3 receptor (HRH3) in RTT patients compared to controls. In the current manuscript, we expand this H3 receptor profiling to additional RTT patient brain samples representing distinct disease mutations and confirm significantly reduced levels of H3 receptor expression in the majority of patients compared to controls. Using mouse models of RTT and MDS, we observed antiparallel changes in H3 receptor expression across various brain areas, with Hrh3 expression being reduced in RTT model animals and increased in a mouse model of MDS. We then tested the hypothesis that phenotypes in these mouse models would be sensitive to an H3 receptor agonist for RTT and an antagonist for MDS. This point is particularly salient for MDS, as there are no approved treatments available; encouragingly, however, the H3 antagonist/inverse agonist pitolisant (Wakix) has recently been approved for the treatment of narcolepsy, and we sought here to determine if there was potential to repurpose pitolisant for MDS. We evaluated both a small molecule agonist of the H3 receptor, (R)--methylhistamine (RAMH), and pitolisant in RTT and MDS models, respectively, to determine impacts on phenotypes in these disease models.

NAADP does not bind these channels directly but requires binding proteins, such as JPT2/HN1L and LSM12. So far, their function has been analyzed in several cell lines; however, their physiological relevance in cell types known to utilize NAADP signaling remains unclear. Here, we generated JPT2/HN1L-deficient (Jpt2/Hn1l-/-) mice to evaluate the contribution of JPT2/HN1L proteins to platelet aggregation and Ca2+ signaling in cardiomyocytes, mast cells, and CD4+ T cells. NAADP is known to contribute to Collagen-related peptide (CRP)-evoked platelet aggregation, but this was not altered by JPT2/HN1L deletion. Functional Ca2+ imaging revealed that JPT2/HN1L plays a strikingly cell-type specific role in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release. In beating ventricular cardiomyocytes, {beta}-adrenergic stimulation is known to evoke arrhythmogenic spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ transients, which were not altered in their frequency in Jpt2/Hn1l-/- myocytes. Antigen-evoked Ca2+ transients in peritoneal mast cells (PMCs) are not changed in Jpt2/Hn1l-/- PMCs. However, CD4+ T-cells displayed a pronounced requirement for JPT2/HN1L. Following T-cell receptor stimulation with anti-CD3, global Ca2+elevations and early NAADP-driven Ca2+ microdomains, which occur within milliseconds of TCR engagement and serve as initiating signals for downstream immune activation, were significantly decreased in Jpt2/Hn1l-/- CD4+ cells. We conclude that JPT2/HN1L is indispensable for NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release in T-cells, but dispensable in cardiomyocytes, platelets, and mast cells, where the presence of LSM12 might compensate for the loss of JPT2/HN1L.

We identify critical residues in Ku (E246, V248, S258, K260, and N266) and the LigD polymerase (D162, V194, R198) and ligase (D522, K579, L580) domains that mediate this interaction. In addition, we address how this interaction influences LigD activity. Functional assays reveal that Ku stimulates LigD ligase activity through contacts with both enzymatic domains, while Ku attenuates template-dependent polymerase activity, contrasting from previous studies in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, potentially through restricting active site accessibility or altering the conformational dynamics of the enzyme. Disrupting the Ku-LigD interface, either through Ku or LigD mutations, abolishes ligase stimulation and restores polymerase activity, highlighting a dual regulatory mechanism. Our data supports a model in which Kus C-terminal region forms a bipartite interface with LigD to balance repair activity and fidelity. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the Ku-LigD repair mechanism and uncovers species-specific differences in bacterial NHEJ.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/693941v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@816968org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f3f9eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9c318org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7767ed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

M.; Potter, G. J.; Bruce, K. D.", "abstract": "Microglia, the primary immune cells of the brain, orchestrate immune responses to both external and internal stimuli in health and disease. Although several cell culture methods exist to model microglia in vitro, isolating loosely adherent microglia from primary murine mixed glial cultures remains valuable for recapitulating in vivo cell states from complex transgenic lines at relatively low cost. However, these methods are constrained by limited temporal control and scalability. To address these challenges, we established a protocol for generating microglia from frozen mixed glial cultures. While freezing introduced measurable differences in microglial morphology and lipid droplet content, microglia derived from frozen cultures responded to environmental stimuli (high glucose and LPS) in the same way as those from fresh cultures. Thus, while frozen primary microglia exhibit similar functional responses, maintaining consistency in using fresh or frozen cells within a given experiment is strongly recommended.\n\nMotivationAlthough our understanding of microglias role in brain development and disease continues to grow, a standardized in vitro model of primary mouse microglia remains absent in the field. Primary cell culture systems are essential for studying microglia, enabling the empirical assessment of gene function in transgenic models and testing novel interventions before committing to time- and cost-intensive in vivo studies. However, mixed glial culture-derived primary microglia (pMG) systems are constrained by the timing of animal availability and have limited scalability. In this study, we sought to establish a protocol for freezing and subsequently reviving primary mixed glial cultures from which responsive pMG could be isolated for downstream analysis. We validated this approach by quantifying microglia responses to distinct environmental stimuli before and after a freeze-thaw cycle.\n\nResearch topicsCP: Cell biology", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

While dietary sources of animal origin (e.g., red meat) contribute to the carnitine pool, de novo carnitine synthesis from trimethyllysine (TML) is essential, particularly for those whose dietary sources are vegetables and fruits that contain negligible amounts of carnitine. However, the molecular pathway of de novo carnitine synthesis and its physiological significance remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that SLC25A45 is a mitochondrial TML carrier that controls de novo carnitine biosynthesis in vivo. Genetic loss of SLC25A45 results in systemic carnitine and acylcarnitine deficiency, leading to impaired fatty acid oxidation and thermogenesis during cold adaptation, while promoting glucose catabolism. Notably, Slc25a45-deficient mice maintained a high respiratory exchange ratio and impaired lipid mobilization following treatment with a GLP1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), rendering them resistant to GLP-1RA-induced adipose tissue loss. Together, the present study identifies SLC25A45 as a regulatory checkpoint in fuel switching during adaptation, with implications for systemic energy balance and response to GLP-1RA-mediated anti-obesity therapy.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

Previously, genomic studies have identified Agrobacterium-derived sequences in the sweet potato genome. Among these, the IbACS (Agrocinopine Synthase) gene encodes an enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of agrocinopine A, a sugar-phosphodiester opine that can be metabolized and utilized by specific microorganisms harboring the corresponding catabolic enzymes. Because IbACS has been conserved in cultivated sweet potato varieties, it is suggested that endogenous agrocinopine production by sweet potato contributes to interactions with environmental microbes, thereby supporting plant growth under nutrient-limited conditions. To test this hypothesis, we generated IbACS-disrupted lines using genome editing. Growth of the knockout plants was markedly reduced in non-sterile soil, while no difference was observed in sterile conditions. These results suggest that the role of IbACS is linked to interactions with the microbial community rather than to intrinsic plant development. Metagenomic analyses of rhizosphere communities revealed that IbACS disruption caused extensive remodeling of microbial composition, including strong reductions in Proteobacteria taxa such as Oxalobacteraceae and decreases in key genera like Massilia and Ensifer, along with lower community evenness and the expansion of opportunistic minor taxa. Together, these microbial shifts indicate that IbACS is required for the assembly of a functionally supportive rhizosphere microbiome that promotes sweet potato growth in soil environments.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

Herein, we developed a physiologically relevant 3D culture model using primary human BMAds from red hematopoietic rich-areas (rBMAds) and we showed that rBMAds engage in metabolic crosstalk with PCa cells. Specifically, rBMAds release free fatty acids (FFAs) through a non-canonical lipolytic pathway and these FFAs are taken up by PCa cells inducing a transcriptional reprogramming that promotes motility. Among the responsive genes, Angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4) is the most upregulated via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma}-dependent mechanism, and its silencing abolishes the rBMAd-driven migratory and invasive phenotype.

By combining various machine learning bioinformatic techniques, we analysed >1000 Gram-positive conjugative plasmids from diverse species, including major pathogens, and identified pili forming VirB2-like proteins in almost all of them.

LD act as a hub that modulates the availability of fatty acids to sustain metabolic needs and the generation of fatty-acid derived signals. Recent evidence demonstrates that LD metabolism regulates immune responses including in microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. We have previously shown that blocking LD lipolysis in microglia reduces acute pro-inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) including cytokine and prostanoid synthesis. Here, we investigated the role of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), a key enzyme catalyzing the final step of TG synthesis, in microglial LD biogenesis and inflammatory responses induced by LPS. We found that treatment with LPS downregulates specific enzymes in the TG synthesis pathway in primary microglia, including GPAT1, AGPAT3, AGPAT5, and DGAT1, while upregulating TMEM68, a non-canonical TG synthesizing enzyme. Pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 significantly reduced LD formation in both oleate- and LPS-stimulated conditions, indicating that DGAT1 is essential for inflammation-induced LD synthesis. Moreover, DGAT1 inhibition selectively decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1{beta}, without affecting IL-6, CCL2, or the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-{beta}.

Here, we present CAD-C, a new chromatin-conformation capture strategy that uses Caspase-Activated DNase (CAD) to fragment chromatin. Fragmentation of chromatin to the nucleosome level by CAD digestion substantially enhances proximity ligation, enabling formation of multi-nucleosome ligation products. Nanopore sequencing of these long DNA molecules allows reconstruction of chromatin fiber connectivity and 3D contact maps with single nucleosome resolution. Importantly, CAD-C is able to identify sister-chromatid interactions at high resolution which reveals that centromeres are closely paired and that cohesin maintains sister chromatids in near perfect alignment where the same nucleosomes are associated across sisters.

We observe spontaneous aminoacyl transfer from the 2'/3'-hydroxyl of a donor oligonucleotide to the 5'-hydroxyl of an adjacent template-bound acceptor oligonucleotide. In RNA systems dominated by base pairing, this transfer drives selective accumulation of the more stable 5'-aminoacyl RNA in the presence of a prebiotically-plausible aminoacylation reagent.

We find that PLCDs that are sufficient and necessary for phase separation confer thermoresponsive variability to full-length proteins. Sequence analysis and simulations reveal that thermoresponsiveness is encoded in compositional heuristics, with sufficient PLCDs enriched in aliphatic and aromatic residues, enabling accurate prediction and rational tuning of condensation thresholds. Engineered variants with altered sequence composition exhibit predictable shifts in thermoresponsive behavior, confirming a direct, sequence-level encoding of temperature sensitivity.

Here we dissect RD3 using cell-based reporter assays, protein interaction assays with recombinant proteins, and crosslinking mass spectrometry. We identify multiple short RD3 peptides that are sufficient for repression and bind directly to the C-terminal NOT module of CCR4-NOT, comprising CNOT1, CNOT2, and CNOT3 subunits. Crosslinking reveals numerous mutually exclusive contacts between RD3 and the NOT module, consistent with a multivalent fuzzy binding mode in which interactions are not defined by a single sequence or structure.

M.", "abstract": "Tree plantations are expanding worldwide, negatively affecting native bird communities. However, most research has focused on the impact of tree monocultures on bird taxonomic diversity, while studies on their effects on functional and phylogenetic diversities are limited. This study aimed to compare different bird diversity facets between Eucalypt monocultures and mixed tree plantations, as well as the impact of proximity to urban areas. Bird surveys were conducted during spring using point counts in central Argentina. The mixed tree plantations consisted of Cedrus deodara, Eucalyptus globulus, Ligustrum lucidum, Pinus taeda, and Celtis australis, with more understorey cover compared to Eucalypt monocultures. Although bird species richness and Simpson diversity were similar between tree plantations, mixed plantations exhibited higher Shannon diversity. Functional and phylogenetic diversities were comparable across plantation types but were significantly influenced by the distance to urban areas. Functional diversity decreased near urban areas, while phylogenetic diversity showed the opposite pattern. The results showed that the increased habitat heterogeneity of mixed plantations likely supported more diverse bird communities, including a greater number of species typical of native woodlands in central Argentina. Additionally, the landscape context significantly influenced the bird communities in tree plantations.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

For example, under the Fisher Geometric Model, which assumes universal pleiotropy, all new mutations will have the same effect on fitness, and complexity governs the strength of selection. However, the extent of pleiotropy in biological systems is debated. In this study, we addressed this question by investigating how genome biology affects molecular evolution using whole genome data from Arabidopsis thaliana and Capsella grandiflora, two closely related Brassica species that vary significantly in their demography and mating system. Results were similar across both species. We found that several genome biology traits, including gene expression level, a trait related to pleiotropy, and gene network connectivity, a trait related to complexity, were predictive of the efficiency of selection and the mean strength and variance of selection acting against new deleterious variants, and that these patterns were not solely due to variation in local effective population size across the genome. We also found evidence that similar sites experience purifying selection at both long and short evolutionary timescales. Our results suggest that, across the genome, molecular evolutionary patterns are in agreement with the predictions of the FGM, albeit relaxing the assumption of universal pleiotropy.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

Until now, knowledge on the genetic control of stem rust resistance in Italian ryegrass has been limited to a few quantitative trait loci identified in bi-parental mapping populations. To discover novel resistance sources for use in breeding programs, appropriate plant populations, reliable phenotyping methods and advanced genomic tools are essential. In this study, we utilized a previously established F2 nested association mapping (NAM) population comprising 708 individuals derived from 24 founder plants exhibiting high variation in stem rust resistance. Phenotypic evaluation was conducted under natural inoculation in three location-by-year combinations. By integrating reduced-representation sequencing of the NAM population with whole-genome sequencing of the founder plants, we identified 3,199,253 SNP markers for association mapping. The high SNP marker density, together with the strong detection power of the NAM population, enabled the identification of four novel candidate genes. Two of these genes, located on chromosomes 6 and 7, encode receptor-like serine/threonine kinases that are known to play a role in stem rust resistance in other crops. Within the serine/threonine kinase gene Chr7.32208, two superior haplotypes were identified that can be directly implemented as selection criteria in breeding programs. The novel stem rust resistance candidate genes reported here provide promising targets for functional validation and the improvement of stem rust resistance in Italian ryegrass breeding.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

S.; Muller, S.; Greb, T.", "abstract": "The control of cell division plane orientation is fundamental for organizing developmental processes and shaping bodies of multicellular organisms. In plants, radial organ growth is mediated by the cambium, a stem cell niche deeply embedded in expanding organs and continuously producing xylem and phloem in a strictly bidirectional manner. Cambium stem cells (CSCs) are unique in comparison to other plant stem cells as they consistently divide along their longest axis clearly overriding the commonly found short axis rule. Despite the topological consistency of CSC divisions and the functional importance of proper division plane orientation for CSC derivatives, the regulatory mechanisms behind this consistency remain unknown. Here, we characterized microtubule organization during CSC divisions in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that division plane orientation is established independently from spindle orientation and the preprophase band (PPB). This conclusion is based on the remarkable variability of spindle orientation during metaphase and the robustness of CSC divisions in PPB-deficient mutants. Instead, the orientation of division planes depends on the cortical division zone (CDZ) and CDZ-related PHRAGMOPLAST ORIENTING KINESIN (POK) proteins. Our results highlight the importance of wood-forming CSCs and their subcellular characterization as an instructive example for the determination of cell division orientation in plants.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

However, despite their popularity, it remains unclear how accurately TWAS recover the true direction of a gene's effect on a trait. Here, we estimate the false sign rate (FSR) of TWAS for plasma proteins, leveraging the expectation that increased gene expression should generally increase protein expression. We then extend this framework to complex traits, where loss-of-function burden tests provide the expected direction-of-effect. In both analyses, we observe high discordance with expectations, with TWAS showing an FSR of 23% for plasma proteins and 33% for complex traits. While colocalization-based filtering reduced the FSR, substantial discordance remained, and with substantial loss of recall. However, when we restricted gene-direction assignments for plasma proteins to using only relevant tissues in combination with colocalization-based filtering, the FSR dropped to 11%, and to just 5% if we excluded brain-specific proteins. We propose that much of the sign discordance arises when eQTLs in non-trait-relevant tissues tag GWAS-associated haplotypes via distinct, tightly-linked regulatory variants, yielding spurious TWAS associations with the correct genes but with unreliable direction-of-effect. These findings show that TWAS-based direction-of-effect estimates should be interpreted with caution and raise concerns about the reliability of TWAS more broadly.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

Phylogenetic trees inferred from coalescent-based analyses, together with Quartet Sampling (QS) evaluation, confirm the monophyly of Lecanoraceae and recover several well-supported lineages. The Lecanora subfusca group is resolved as polyphyletic, comprising three major clades together with Zeora and Vainionora. Additional strongly supported lineages correspond to Glaucomaria s. lat., the MPRPS clade, and Lecidella s. lat., while Bryonora and Frutidella represent early-diverging members of the family. The L. fuscescens group and Miriquidica form a distinct lineage sister to Lecanoraceae, whereas Ramboldia (Ramboldiaceae) constitutes another sister family. Backbone support was generally improved, and QS analyses showed counter-support for only a few deep nodes, indicating a complex evolutionary history likely shaped by incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization, or rapid radiation.

We developed a quantitative degradation assay to assess ion release from these ultra-small nanocrystals, revealing that while all three particles biodegrade, CuInS2 and CuFeS2 undergo rapid degradation in artificial lysosomal fluid, leading to a burst release of indium and iron ions. In cellular toxicity assays, CuInS2 exhibited significantly higher toxicity than Cu2-xS and CuFeS2, primarily due to indium-induced necrosis. To mitigate this toxicity, an alternative surface-binding polymer coating was introduced, effectively reducing both the degradation rate and cytotoxicity of CuInS2.

However, current models of human memory remain unclear how these feature-specific reinstatements unfold over time, and whether they interact hierarchically during memory retrieval. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and time-resolved encoding-retrieval cross-phase classification analysis, we compared the time course of conceptual and perceptual reinstatement during cued visual recall. Conceptual information decoding in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) preceded perceptual information decoding in the ventral visual cortex (VVC), and the two were expressed in distinct frequency bands: theta (4-8 Hz) for conceptual and gamma (30-40 Hz) for perceptual information. Cross-correlation and spectral Granger causality analyses revealed that during reinstatement conceptual information in vmPFC predicted and directed perceptual information in VVC, with theta-band information flow predominantly from vmPFC to VVC. In addition, bottom-up connectivity from VVC to vmPFC was expressed in the alpha band. These findings suggest that memory retrieval proceeds from abstract conceptual reconstruction to the reinstatement of perceptual details, mediated by theta oscillatory communication between prefrontal and sensory areas. We propose a hierarchical interactive model in which vmPFC initiates conceptual activation through theta-band top-down signals, while VVC provides alpha-band feedback for evaluating reconstructed perceptual details.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "Phosphate is central to modern bioenergetics and to all theories for the origin of life. How and where phosphate entered metabolism are unknown, but microbial physiology and geochemical environments can provide important clues. Some bacteria obtain electrons and energy from phosphite (HPO32-), a reduced form of phosphate (HPO42-), that naturally occurs in serpentinizing (H2-producing) hydrothermal systems. Here we show that native palladium, which also occurs in serpentinizing hydrothermal systems, catalyzes the oxidation of phosphite to phosphate and H2 in water at 25-100 C in an exergonic reaction. Phosphite oxidation over Pd in water generates a reactive but yet unknown chemical intermediate, possibly metaphosphate, [PO3]-, that phosphorylates hydroxyl moieties in a wide spectrum of biologically relevant compounds including glycerol, ribose, glucose, serine and cytidine, forming phosphoester bonds at 25-100 C in 2-72 h. The same conditions also phosphorylate (i) phosphate residues, forming phosphoanhydride bonds in pyrophosphate, polyphosphates and ADP, (ii) creatine, forming the phosphoramidate bond in phosphocreatine, and (iii) acetate, forming acetyl phosphate. The reactions proceed without sulfur, excluding thioester or metal sulfide intermediates. Phosphite-dependent phosphorylations under conditions of serpentinization identify a natural, geochemical source of prebiotic phosphorylation and furthermore identify a source of continuous, aqueous metabolic energy that overcomes thermodynamic barriers at origins. This novel route of phosphorylation explains the centrality of phosphate in heredity and energetics as a chemical inheritance from the site where metabolism and life arose.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

We analyzed existing data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of ALS patients by machine learning, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), minimizing the issue of multi-collinearity shown in a multiple regression model, and identified a non-linear combination of gene sets to classify healthy controls and ALS, since non-linear approaches can capture intricate gene-gene interactions and threshold effects, which are often critical for accurately distinguishing disease from healthy states. In the gene expression profiles of PBMCs, a combination of expression levels in 3 genes, PRKAR1A, QPCT, and TMEM71, enabled us to classify ALS with an area under the curve (AUC) accuracy of 0.83 from the public database, which were then confirmed by laboratory blood samples with an AUC accuracy of 0.85.

Although hypoxia is known to contribute to MASLD pathogenesis, the role of hypoxia signaling remains poorly defined. We investigated whether HypoxamicroRNA-210 (miR-210), a key hypoxia-inducible microRNA, regulates hepatic lipid metabolism and MASLD development. Methods Serum miR-210 levels were quantified in MASLD patients and matched controls. Human hepatic spheroids and HepG2 cells were exposed to fatty acids to assess miR-210 induction and lipid accumulation. miR-210 knockout mice were fed a Western diet to evaluate hepatic steatosis and transcriptomic changes using RNA sequencing. RNA pull-down and 3'UTR-driven luciferase reporter assays were employed to identify miR-210 targets. Functional effects of miR-210 mimic were examined in knockout mice, db/db mice, and in vitro human hepatic spheroid models. Results Serum miR-210 levels were significantly reduced in MASLD patients compared with matched controls. Consistently, human hepatic spheroids did not appropriately increase miR-210 expression in response to fatty acid-induced intracellular hypoxia. This blunted miR-210 response contributed to hepatic lipid accumulation, as loss of miR-210 in a mouse model of MASLD led to increased hepatic lipid deposition and activation of lipid metabolic pathways. We identified CIDEC as a direct miR-210 target mediating its inhibitory effects on hepatic lipid accumulation, and restoring miR-210 expression suppressed CIDEC and reduced hepatic lipid content in knockout mice on a Western diet. Moreover, miR-210 attenuated lipid accumulation in both in vitro human hepatic spheroids and in vivo db/db mice models of MASLD.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which these mutations confer CPFX-resistance to P. aeruginosa are unknown.

At the earliest stage, transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or Golgi apparatus is mediated by coat protein complex II (COPII). COPII coats consist of inner and outer layers formed by Sec23-Sec24 heterodimers and Sec13-Sec31 heterotetramers, respectively, which initially assemble at ER exit sites (ERES) to form transport carriers. Sec23-interacting protein (Sec23IP) links the inner and outer coats through its interactions with both Sec23A and Sec31A, positioning it as a key potential regulator of COPII function. However, the mechanisms controlling Sec23IP activity remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how physiological stimuli regulate COPII function through the dynamic modification of Sec23IP by O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a reversible, intracellular form of glycosylation. We first validated Sec23IP as a bona fide O-GlcNAcylated protein. Rescue experiments in Sec23IP knockout cells with a nearly unglycosylatable mutant protein demonstrated the essential role of O-GlcNAcylation in the intrinsically disordered domain in protein transport and in recruiting Sec31A to ERES. Moreover, O-GlcNAcylation of Sec23IP increased during protein transport, coinciding with a reduction in its interaction with Sec31A. These results indicate that distinct site-specific O-GlcNAcylation of Sec23IP spatiotemporally modulates its association with Sec31A to fine-tune ERES recruitment and COPII assembly/disassembly.

In utero fetoplacental bioluminescence imaging showed that PER2 levels rose exponentially during pregnancy, with variable daily peak times that stabilized to dusk by E15.5. Interestingly, pregnancies that did not exhibit daily in utero PER2 variation were more likely to fail. Because maternal glucocorticoids have been implicated in fetal development and synchronizing other circadian tissues, we tested its capability to shift fetoplacental PER2 rhythms in utero. Daily subcutaneous glucocorticoid injections over five days of late pregnancy phase-dependently shifted the fetoplacental PER2 rhythms in utero. Blocking glucocorticoid signaling in vitro reduced synchrony between maternal and fetal placenta by ~40%. We conclude that in utero daily rhythms gradually develop and synchronize with the mother prior to birth, potentially through glucocorticoid signaling.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

E.; Qin, J.; Totsika, M.", "abstract": "Bacteria exhibit two lifestyles: planktonic free-floating individual cells or sessile multicellular aggregates known as biofilms. The biofilm lifecycle is characterised by three distinct stages: attachment, maturation and dispersal. Specific signals govern each stage triggering responses that spatially and temporally regulate bacterial attachment to a surface, synthesis of extracellular matrix components and their subsequent degradation. Characterising these signals is therefore a valuable approach to develop novel antibiofilm therapies. Here, we used the model biofilm-forming bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to characterise the transcriptional profiles of each stage of the biofilm life cycle: attachment, biofilm maturation and spontaneous dispersal. We report that surface attachment was accompanied by the upregulation of genes comprising the mechanosensor Pil-Chp, whereas biofilm maturation characterised with the upregulation of genes involved in Pel polysaccharide synthesis, siaD and PA4396 diguanylate cyclases as well as pipA, fimX and PA5442. In contrast, dispersing cells upregulated genes responsible for alginate, rhamnolipid, and extracellular nucleases (eddA, eddB) biosynthesis, as well as the transcriptional regulator of dispersal amrZ. Additionally, genes encoding the quorum sensing dispersal molecule cis-2-decenoic acid (dspS and dspI), canonical phosphodiesterases (nbdA and rbdA) and eleven other c-di-GMP-related enzymes were also upregulated during dispersal. Our comprehensive analysis of transcriptional profiles associated with different biofilm stages allowed us to define a subset of fourteen genes as biomarkers of biofilm dispersal. Our study therefore provides benchmarking stage-specific transcriptional profiles for P. aeruginosa biofilms in closed culture systems, which led to the identification of a dispersal fingerprint marking the onset of dispersal.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

The stolen chloroplasts (kleptoplasts) confer photosynthetic capacity to the host. This study investigated how chloroplast lipidomes from two macroalgae (Acetabularia acetabulum and Bryopsis sp.) are modified after sequestration by the photosynthetic sea slugs Elysia crispata, Elysia viridis, and Elysia timida. Pigments were analysed by HPLC, and lipidomic profiling of chloroplasts (glycolipids, betaine lipids, phytosterols) was conducted using C18-LC-MS/MS. Kleptoplasts retain intact algal pigment profile. Glycolipid signatures in sea slug tissues closely resembled those of their algal donors, although shifts in relative abundances suggest remodelling of plastidial membranes, potentially affecting kleptoplast morphology, particularly membrane curvature and stability. In contrast, betaine lipid composition differed markedly between sea slugs and algal donors, with major betaine species common to all sea slugs. Phytosterol composition was better preserved in sea slugs feeding on Bryopsis sp. than on A. acetabulum. This study demonstrated that kleptoplast lipidomes maintain a strong algal identity but undergo selective modifications within the animal host. This remodelling likely optimizes membrane architecture to support long-term stability and photosynthetic functionality within the hosts' cellular environment, facilitating the integration and performance of sea slug kleptoplasts.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

We upgraded a single-channel sorter to a dual-channel one without redesigning the microscopy setup, which can monitor FRET signals during enzyme reactions in droplets at kilohertz rates. We applied this upgraded sorter to improve the incorporation efficiency of KOD DNA polymerase towards reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides, a property crucial for its application in next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our data show that a single-round sorting can achieve 30-fold enrichment of active variants. Five KOD variants enabling 100-cycle single-end runs of DNA sequencing were identified using a novel cyclic reversible termination (CRT) substrate featuring a terminator group {approx} 5-fold bulkier than the classical azidomethyl moiety. We also engineered a metagenome-derived novel polymerase, and a variant achieving 90% terminator incorporation efficiency within 2 minutes was identified after two rounds of enrichment.

FVII Gla locks onto EPCR surface through the cooperative contribution of Ca2+ ions, residues of gamma carboxyglutamic acid and the hydrophobic omega-loop, essentially recapitulating PC docking, and confirming absolute structural competition for EPCR binding. These findings resolve a long-standing gap and inform the structural basis for the binding of a pharmacologically relevant coagulation factor to EPCR, illustrating the complete steric competition with PC. Such competition is dictated by a conserved Gla domain fold-driven mechanism of recognition with potential implications for pharmacological rFVIIa intervention in hemophilia.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

The nucleus, as the largest and stiffest cellular organelle, often limits cellular deformability, making it a key factor in migration through narrow pores or highly constrained spaces. In this work, we introduce a geometric surface partial differential equation (GS-PDE) model in which the cell plasma membrane and nuclear envelope are described as evolving energetic closed surfaces governed by force-balance equations. We replicate the results of a biophysical experiment, where a microfluidic device is used to impose compressive stresses on cells by driving them through narrow microchannels under a controlled pressure gradient. The model is validated by reproducing cell entry into the microchannels. A parametric sensitivity analysis highlights the dominant influence of specific parameters, whose accurate estimation is essential for faithfully capturing the experimental setup. We found that surface tension and confinement geometry emerge as key determinants of translocation efficiency. Although tailored to this specific setup for validation purposes, the framework is sufficiently general to be applied to a broad range of cell mechanics scenarios, providing a robust and flexible tool for investigating the interplay between cell mechanics and confinement. It also offers a solid foundation for future extensions integrating more complex biochemical processes such as active confined migration.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

This situation is well illustrated in continental Southeast Asia, where studies of large mammal assemblages have largely focused on teeth and cranial elements, while postcranial remains are rarely investigated. To address this issue, we established an osteometric reference dataset of the limb bones from Southeast Asian ruminant species and analyzed both the potential of raw measurements and osteometric ratios to identify the different taxa. The results reveal significant differences between genera and species, allowing size-based grouping and precise taxonomic identification in some cases. These data were subsequently used to develop an easy-to-use identification tool based solely on measurements. The performance of this tool was tested against previously published datasets, allowing confirmation of existing results, and discussion of potential biases associated with identification based on measurements alone.

Results demonstrated significant differences in cerebral blood flow between the saline and sodium L-lactate administered at 0.5 g/kg (112 {+/-} 5 vs 127 {+/-} 2 mL/100g/min), saline and sodium L-lactate administered at 1 g/kg (112 {+/-} 5 vs 90 {+/-} 5 mL/100g/min), and between sodium L-lactate at 0.5 g/kg and sodium L-lactate at 1 g/kg (127 {+/-} 2 vs 90 {+/-} 5 mL/100g/min). There was excellent reproducibility of cerebral perfusion measurements (ICC > 0.95) between observers, indicating high reliability in these results.

Using tissues and clinical data derived from multiple institutional biobanks, in-depth characterization of the proteome of ventricular samples was undertaken. Relative to HFrEF, the HFpEF cohort exhibited minimal proteome composition overlap and pronounced heterogeneity. A key finding of this investigation is that sex per se did not confer a distinctive proteomic HFpEF signature. Rather, two HFpEF proteomic profiles were identified, differing significantly in sex ratios. The identification of two Clusters revealed that HFpEF has two predominant proteomic signatures at the molecular level, marked by differences in the extent and nature of structural and contractile machinery and by local cellular and ECM communications. Upstream regulator analysis identified various molecular leads to be pursued in defining these two HFpEF profiles.

A.; Trcek, T.", "abstract": "Germlines contain ribonucleoprotein condensates known as germ granules, which concentrate proteins and mRNAs essential for animal development. Vasa, a conserved DEAD-box RNA helicase, is a core and highly concentrated constituent of germ granules. However, its roles within these structures remain poorly understood. Here, we use Drosophila germ granules as a model system to address this question. Applying in vivo and human cell systems, we found that condensation of Oskar (Osk) protein, which nucleates germ granules, occurred independently of Vasa. However, in oocytes lacking detectable Vasa protein, Osk formed aggregated condensates regardless of the eGFP tag. Furthermore, Osk-eGFP showed minimal recovery as measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) indicating that its exchange between condensates and their surroundings was greatly reduced in the absence of Vasa. Supporting this result, co-expression of Vasa increased the FRAP recovery of Osk-eGFP condensates and reduced Osk-eGFP partitioning into them in cells. This effect required the interaction between Vasa and Osk, suggesting that by binding Osk, Vasa modulates Osk phase behavior and its condensate material properties. Super-resolution microscopy further revealed that Vasa is required for germ granule mRNA localization to Osk condensates in vivo. Co-expression of Vasa with Osk-eGFP is necessary and sufficient to recruit germ granule mRNAs to condensates in cells. Although this activity depends on Vasa-Osk interaction, the interaction itself is not sufficient. Notably, localization of a conserved germ granule mRNA nanos reduced the FRAP recovery of Osk-eGFP condensates in cells, partially counteracting Vasa effect. Collectively, our findings uncovered a novel function of the DEAD-box RNA helicase Vasa in regulating the material properties of Osk condensates through coordinated protein-protein and protein-mRNA interactions.", "date": "2025-12-20", "journal": ""}

To address these limitations, we present a novel recombinant chymotrypsin (rChymoSelect) engineered for improved cleavage specificity and robustness in proteomics workflows. Benchmarking against standard bovine chymotrypsin revealed 97 % C terminal cleavages after tyrosine (Y), phenylalanine (F), and leucine (L) for rChymoSelect, compared with 72 % for the standard enzyme. This enhanced cleavage specificity reduced missed cleavages and increased peptide spectrum matches across charge states.
